Notes from House Hearing on Cryptography Export Controls <p>

From: djw@eff.org (Daniel J. Weitzner)
Subject: Notes from House Hearing on Cryptography Export Controls <p>

October 12, 1993
House Foreign Affairs Committee
Subcommittee on Economic Policy, Trade, and the Enviornment
Hearing on mass market cryptography and export controls
Rep. Sam Gejdenson (D-Conn.), Chair <p>

[A hopefully informative and probably biased account of the hearing by EFF] <p>

Committee Members present: <p>

Gejdenson, Cantwell (D-Wash.), Fingerhut (D-Ohio), Rohrbacher (R-Calif.)
Manzullo (R-Ill.) <p>

Witnesses: <p>

PANEL 1 (Open) <p>

J. Hendren, Arkansas Systems (A data security firm that does a lot of
international banking work) <p>

Ray Ozzie, IRIS Associates for Business Software Alliance (Lotus Notes
developer) <p>

Stephen Walker, Trusted Information Systems for Software Publishers Association <p>

Philip Zimmermann, PGP developer <p>

Don Harbert, Digital Eqiupment Corp. <p>

PANEL 2 (Secret Session) <p>

NSA representative <p>

Opening Statement of Gejdenson: <p>

"This hearing is about the well intentioned attempts of the National
Security Agency to try to control the uncontrollable....  The NSA itself
acknowledges that if you have a long distance telephone line and a modem,
you can send this software anywhere in the world.  If you have a computer
and a modem you can take this software off of the Internet anywhere in the
world....  I do not question the value of the information sought by the
National Security Agency.  But once it is determined that the dispersion of
this software cannot be controlled, then however much we might want to
protect our ability to obtain information, it is beyond our means to do so.
 Just as in the case of telecommunications, the National Security Agency is
attempting to put the genie back in the bottle.  It won't happen; and a
vibrant and productive sector of American indsutry may be sacrificed in the
process." <p>

The main points raised by witnesses were these: <p>

1. DES and other strong encryption which is barred by ITAR is in the public
domain and available on the global market from foreign software
manufacturers: <p>

-Ray Ozzie used his laptop and a modem to show how to get a DES
implementation from ftp.germany.eu.net.  The committee loved it and most of
them seemed to understand what was going on on the screen, even though they
had never heard of ftp. <p>

-Stephen Walker described the results of an SPA study which uncovered over
250 cryptography packages which offer DES-based or stronger algorithms. <p>

-Phil Zimmermann testified that he designed PGP from publicly available
information. <p>

2. Foreign DES implementations are just as good as US versions.
Surprisingly enough, this is a contentious issue.  Some members of the
committee seemed to have been told by someone or another that foreign
versions of DES may not be as strong as those that are made in the USA.  If
this were true, then export controls might still be justified despite the
numerous foreign versions of DES on the market.  In my view, this is a
pretty desperate argument. <p>

-Steve Walker demonstrated that all DES works the same way by encrypting a
passage from Mozart's Eine Kleine Nachtmusik with several different foreign
DES packages, and then decrypting them.  Surprise!  They all sounded just
the same. <p>

3. Lots of money is being lost by US software/hardware vendors: <p>

-Don Harbert from DEC told of loses of over $70 Million in just the last
few months. <p>

-BSA estimates that export controls exclude access to a global market the
is $6-9 Billion. <p>

4. People want their privacy <p>

-Phil Zimmermann told the committee about his experience with PGP users and
how badly people need and want to protect their privacy in electronic
environments <p>

Committee Responses: <p>

Overall, the committee was quite sympathetic to the witnesses.  Chairman
Gejdenson seemed very supportive of changing export controls.  Rep. Dana
Rohrbacher, no flaming liberal, said, "the cold war is over.  I sympathize
with everything that has been said here." <p>

from Telecom, partial text of CPSR press rreleease on NII <p>

Palo Alto, Calif., October 25, 1993 -- In the wake of sudden corporate
mergers and rapid technological developments, Computer Professionals
for Social Responsibility (CPSR) today voiced concern that the planned
information superhighway will not realize its full potential.  The
public interest organization put forward specific guidelines for the
National Information Infrastructure (NII) in a paper titled, "Serving
the Community: A Public-Interest Vision of the National Information
Infrastructure."  Urging the Clinton Administration to move quickly to
adopt these principles, CPSR President Eric Roberts said, "Although
there is widespread agreement on general goals, there is no specific
plan to ensure that these goals are met." <p>

"It is much easier to state a vision than to achieve it, " said Dr.
Roberts, who is also Associate Chair of the Computer Science
department at Stanford University.  "And there are many dangers on the
horizon that threaten to compromise the value of the NII as a resource
for the public. <p>

"For example, if a small number of companies dominate the market,
we're in danger of stifling competition and innovation on the network.
If those same companies control the programming, then open and diverse
speech is limited.  If pricing structures do not cover universal
service, the average person and the poor will be struggling to use the
backroads of the information highway.  If privacy isn't protected,
your TV could keep more detailed records of your finances than the
IRS.  And, if the NII is not designed to allow everyone to communicate
freely and to publish their own contributions, it could become nothing
more than a medium for delivering 500-channel television, with
interactivity limited to home-shopping and trying to guess the next
play during sporting events." <p>

CPSR's paper expands on these dangers and makes specific policy and
technical recommendations for the newly formed Information
Infrastructure Task Force.  The Task Force is expected to coordinate
network policy for the Clinton Administration. <p>

"In its 'Agenda for Action' document, the Administration has set forth
a positive vision of what the NII can be," said Dr. Roberts.  "To
achieve that vision, however, the government must play a major role in
the design, development, and regulation of the network."  CPSR recommends
that the Administration adopt the following policies: <p>

o   Promote widespread economic benefits by evaluating the NII's
    economic success using measures that reflect its impact on the
    society as a whole, not merely the profits of NII investors and
    service providers. <p>

o   Evaluate the social impact of the NII by conducting periodic
    reviews as the NII is implemented and used to guarantee that it
   continues to serve the public interest. <p>

o   Guarantee equitable and universal access through an appropriate
    mix of legislation, regulation, taxation, and direct subsidies. <p>

o   Promote the development of a vital civic sector by ensuring
    resources, training, and support for public spaces within the NII
    where citizens can pursue noncommercial activities. <p>

o   Promote a diverse and competitive marketplace in terms of the
    content carried over the NII. <p>

o   Provide access to government services and information over the
    NII. <p>

o   Encourage democratic participation by ensuring full public
    disclosure, and actively promoting democratic decision-making
    and public participation in all stages of the development process. <p>

o   Actively facilitate the seamless connection of America's NII with
    the information infrastructures of other nations by working to
    resolve such issues as security, censorship, tariffs, and privacy. <p>

o   Guarantee the functional integrity of the NII by establishing
    critical technical requirements including ease of use, widespread
    availability, full functionality, high reliability, adequate privacy
    protection, and evolutionary expansion. <p>

<TITLE>Protection and The Inte</TITLE>
<H1>Protection and The Inte</H1>

Protection and The Internet
Steve Cisler
Apple Library <p>

"The unprecedented environment has produced a temperament volatile and
mercurial, marked by uncalculating ardor, enterprise, intrepidity, and
insatiable hunger for innovation, out of which has grown a society that has
been alternately the reproach and marvel of mankind." --John Ingalls
writing about the Great Plains (1902) quoted in W.P. Webb The Great Plains
Grossett and Dunlap 1931. <p>

Summary: Now that the Internet is becoming popular, many people and
organizations want to protect the Internet, protect people from the
Internet, protect individual systems from casual visitors, protect
children from access to certain files and online interactions, and protect
whole cultures from outside influences. <p>

A few years ago, the head of a fee-based online service was asked when the
Internet could be used to access his system. "Why should we hook our
drinking water supply to a sewage system?" was the gist of his reply. Some
time after that a special librarian for a large corporate library stated
that she felt it was her duty to keep the engineers and other patrons in
the company from using a dangerous and dirty system like the Internet. Of
course, they were already using it; she just did not want to get involved
at that time.  Both of these people wanted to protect their enterprise and
their users from what they saw as an uncontrollable, chaotic system, full
of dirty data, unruly computer intruders, foul-fingered Usenet orators,
corrupted programs, and unreliable connections. This view was indicative of
the kind of stratification of the online world. There was not very much
knowledge about or interest in learning about the different segments.
Professional online database searchers did not frequent the world of
Usenet. Internet users looked down at the bulletin board system operators,
and commercial consumer service providers were in their own separate world
with only a few links to these other worlds. CompuServe did not talk to
Fidonet which was unaware of Usenet, and the Internet was a loosely guarded
secret. <p>

Suddenly that has changed, and the focus is on the Internet. The people and
organizations seeking connections, the ability to search for and provide
new information, and the countries where all of this is offered, have
increased at an exciting, alarming, and perhaps even exaggerated rate.
Vinton Cerf, one of the founding fathers of the Internet, argues that it
can now be considered mass media.  It certainly has become mainstream. Not
only do we see jokes about the Internet in the New Yorker, we find
selections from the New Yorker on the Internet. It is reaching Indian
tribes in the U.S., the capitals in Azerbaijan, Mozambique, Croatia, Peru,
Beaverhead County, Montana, and schools throughout Texas. While just a
small fraction of the world's computer users are connected, and even fewer
understand all they are connected to, the Internet offers the dream of
connectivity to many millions in rural and urban areas all over the world.
Even the cable companies, who looked upon the Internet as "invisible" or as
a sideshow in early 1993, are going to offer connections to their customers
by the end of 1993. <p>

Up to 1991 the culture of the Internet has been synonymous with openness,
lack of central control and governance, non-commercial in nature, a place
for experimentation and rapid implementation and change. Some are fond of
comparing the Internet to a frontier. This is due in part to the growth of
the Unix operating system and the intellectual climate in the academic
computing centers and government research labs where Unix and the Internet
spread in the 1980's. In the 1990's we are seeing a concentration on new
tools for users and administrators which in turn is bringing ease of use,
an enormous leap in the amount and kind of content available, and this is
attracting the rush of individuals, companies, schools, libraries,
governments, businesses, and non-profits to the network. With the arrival
of new users, many of them from the commercial sector, a series of cultural
and policy-based brushfires have been started. Stated in crude binary
terms, they center on fee versus free, open and closed systems, anarchic
versus governed, private and anonymous versus centralized secure systems
with accountability, indexed information versus raw data, unimpeded rivers
of data versus filtered, bottled, and marketed information, free speech
versus censorship, access for some versus universal access, flat-rate
pricing versus packets/mile charges, cultural preservation versus cultural
disintegration, and centralized sources of information versus every user as
publisher. <p>

PROTECT: to cover or shield from that which would injure, destroy, or
detrimentally affect; secure or preserve usually against attack,
disintegration, encroachment, or harm.  --Webster's Third New International
Dictionary <p>

As the network traffic explodes in size, diversity, and number of users,
many people including users, administrators, and people not on the Net are
trying to "protect" people, systems, data from use, abuse, or access. As a
librarian, I am interested in extending access to more people, helping them
find  the information, as well as, the personal contacts they need, and in
encouraging the use of the networks to publish that information.  While I
understand the motivation for the practices, it is obvious that many of the
protection methods will decrease the amount of information and narrow the
conditions by which a group of users can get the information. You will
always find some on the Net who believe that it is justified, and many more
who think it's wrong, impossible, or just foolish to try and restrain
access. <p>

The most obvious forms of protections are restricting access to a computer
system,  protecting intellectual property, or keeping certain people from
seeing, doing, or using certain resources. I am not going to discuss the
cryptology wars now raging over the Clipper Chip, RSA algorithms, and
Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) software except to say that it's a very large
issue. In mid-September small American encryption firms are being called in
for some serious discussions with federal officials. Contact the Electronic
Frontier Foundation (ssteele@eff.org) for updates on this controversy. <p>

Anonymity <p>

A long-running argument about the value or danger of anonymity can generate
as much heat as light. Some  argue that many people will be afraid to post
their thoughts and comments if they cannot be anonymous. Frequently cited
are people wanting an open forum on substance abuse, mental illness, rape,
and other sensitive topics. Anonymous mailing services have been set up in
Australia and Finland. However, the anonymous mailers have been used by
individuals who carry online flame wars into another realm. They have used
these services to attack their enemies, make false accusations, one of
which resulted in the loss of the victim's job. While the victims are
fairly sure of the perpetrator, they cannot prove it because he is using an
anonymous mailing service. <p>

There are some more subtle issues we all must face. These are related to
the use of the Internet by young people, by cultural groups where the users
are not aware of the range of information on the Internet, use of anonymous
mailers for spreading slanderous information, the manipulation of software
tools  to change information access, and the editing of files to "cleanse"
them of objectionable information. Even though librarians have had a lot of
experience with book, video, and music censorship battles, these are much
less clear-cut from an intellectual freedom standpoint, and that is only
one aspect of the discussion in most cases. <p>

Access for Elementary and Secondary Schools <p>

Mike Roberts of EDUCOM says that approximately 10% of the American K12
schools have some sort of Internet connection. Materials used and
activities undertaken by elementary and secondary school students comes
under a good deal of scrutiny. This varies by grade level, by school, by
district, and by state. It will be no different when Internet activities
are included in many classrooms. Educators who plan to offer Internet
access immediately confront the challenge of Usenet and anonymous ftp
files. There is a fairly strong consensus that the students must be
protected from some of these discussions and some of the files. The
reasoning comes in various flavors: Some say that they personally don't
find the material objectionable but if the conservative elements in the
state found out, the project would be threatened or canceled.  The
nightmare they have is of some legislator waving around a raunchy GIF image
"paid for with tax dollars and found on the State Educational Network", or
reading some choice posting from alt.sex.furry.critters or
alt.sex.necrophelia. This fear may be unfounded, but it tends to make some
administrators restrain themselves and avoid all Usenet groups. A sensible
compromise is taken by the Boulder Valley School District. Ken
Klingenstein, reported at INET'93 in San Francisco that school committees
are combing through the Usenet groups to save the best and most relevant.
With thousands available, few sites can subscribe to all of them (the
traffic is about 70 megabytes of messages each day). Providing access to
scientific and mathematical information is relatively uncontroversial for
most districts (unless creationism is vying for a place in the curriculum),
but many people are worried about the software, text files, and images that
anyone can access, providing the students learn how to use the arcane ftp
commands and tools for unpacking, converting and displaying the pictures.
Students with time and curiosity may become far more adept at using these
tools than over- worked teachers in some schools connected to the network.
And now the tools are improving where access is much easier. <p>

Gopher <p>

One of the more interesting Internet software projects are the gopher
clients and servers (See "Cool Tools for the Macintosh" Apple Library Users
Group Newsletter , Summer 1993). There are over 1500 public gopher spaces,
and the information being served is about everything imaginable. It ranges
from electronic texts of out-of-copyright books, to campus phone
directories, software libraries, pictures, archives of discussions, and
many unstructured databases. A special program called Veronica has been
written to help users find information within gopher. Veronica runs at
several different sites in the U.S. and Italy. Earlier this year, one site
was informed that when you did a veronica search on the word 'camping' you
reached information about homosexuals. The site modified the program not to
deliver any hits on 'camping'. They decided to protect their users from
material that might offend. Veronica can be configured to avoid searching
on any list of words. A 'stop word' list is usually done to save computer
cycles from looking up 'a', 'the', 'of', and the like. It can also be used
to omit seemingly innocent words like 'camping' or some of George Carlin's
favorite terms. Most users are not aware this is going on, that the
database is searched with a filter. <p>

Some companies are working with the education community to provide network
access and services. Here is Richard Perlman of Pacific Bell describing
their effort: <p>

"Pacific Bell is setting up access to the Internet for elementary and
secondary schools in California.  This, project part of Pacific Bell's
"Knowledge Network", is currently in a technology test authorized by the
California Public Utilities Commission. Pacific Bell is using the Internet
Gopher to present information in a variety of organizational schemes to
meet the needs of students in elementary, junior high school, high school
and community college as well as teachers and librarians.  Pacific Bell is
working with the schools to devise curriculum and lesson plans that
encourage and support the use of information networks as part of the
educational process.  They are also working with school staff and
administration to address issues of content acceptability and appropriate
use." <p>

One possibility is that a young child would have access to one set of
menus, an older student to  more information, and the teacher or librarian
would have full access to all the gophers on the Knowledge Network.
However, Pacific Bell makes it clear that the most persistent user can find
ways around gopher filters, so no school should expect complete protection. <p>

Gophers reflect the open culture of the Internet, and this has caused some
system administrators to wish for more tools to restrict access to the
power of gopher or even to the server itself.  John Stanley manages a
gopher server at the Coastal Imaging Laboratory at Oregon State University.
It is not openly advertised, but it is not totally closed either. In late
August, a heated discussion took place on comp.infosystems.gopher on Usenet
about Stanley's request that the Veronica sites not index his gopher. Some
felt that he was not abiding by unwritten etiquette (open, free
information, free access anytime), but what angered Stanley was that he
asked the indexers not to include information from his gopher, yet they
continued to do so. It seems as though it was more of a communications
(personal) problem than anything else. Stanley believed that the indexing
placed an unwelcome load on his machine, and he wanted to conserve his
computing resources for his users, not an indexing program in Italy.
Michael Morse of the National Science Foundation has proposed that the
gopher server software be delivered with the default set to "no index" and
allow each administrator to turn it on or leave it off. <p>

While some argue about indexes to the information, others object to the
information itself. One gopher site received a great deal of criticism
because the letter writers thought the gopher administrator was posting
unflattering information about the Koran. The discussion in
soc.culture.islam on Usenet prompted many people to write and complain
about the definition of 'Koran" that is found in Ambrose Bierce's Devil's
Dictionary at wiretap.spies.com <p>

KORAN, n.  A book which the Mohammedans foolishly believe to have been
written by divine inspiration, but which Christians know to be a wicked
imposture, contradictory to the Holy Scriptures. <p>

The actual electronic file was not at the index site, only a pointer to
another gopher where the document resided.   By doing a search for other
locations of the same document, I found that the gopher at
ccat.sas.upenn.edu included a version of Bierce's dictionary and left out
the definition for Koran but included this one for Christian: <p>

CHRISTIAN, n.  One who believes that the New Testament is a divinely
inspired book admirably suited to the spiritual needs of his neighbor.  One
who follows the teachings of Christ in so far as they are not inconsistent
with a life of sin. <p>

That edition was broken up into folders for each letter of the alphabet
with each definition being a separate entry. Oddly, in another menu there
was a pointer to the wiretap.spies.com 'unexpurgated' version. Keep in mind
I was only looking for the 'koran' definition. Indeed, there may be several
versions of this dictionary floating around in ftp sites.  While the
Devil's Dictionary is not the Satanic Verses, this does raise the issue of
who is responsible for culling, controlling, and disseminating information,
even barbed witicisms written 80 years ago. <p>

The gopher involved in the Koran controversy now posts this to head off
criticisms: <p>

IF YOU FEEL THAT INFORMATION YOU HAVE OBTAINED VIA &lt;the&gt; GOPHER OR OTHER
INFORMATION SERVERS IS INACCURATE OR OFFENSIVE, WE SUGGEST YOU CONTACT THE
ORIGINAL PRODUCER/DISTRIBUTOR OF THAT INFORMATION. <p>

Usenet <p>

And now let us turn from religion to sex, figuratively speaking. New
communications media have frequently been used to convey sexual content. In
Victorian times there was much discussion about the way the telephone might
be used by people normally polite and restrained. The VCR industry began by
tapping the huge market of people wanting to view pornography (what you
like) and erotica (what I like) in their own homes. The French Minitel
system message traffic in the late 1980's included a huge proportion of
casual sexual banter, online cruising, and gender swapping.Some of the most
popular CD-ROMs don't mention ERIC and MARC, but Valerie is exposed for all
to see. <p>

Because the Internet includes more and more information about human needs
and concerns, there is a load of discussions about sex, pictures, and even
animated video clips. Many old network hands hate to see this mentioned
because it's always over-emphasized by novice reporters who are looking for
the sensational. <p>

Joe Abernathy, who used to report for the Houston Chronicle, wrote an
introduction to the Internet and its use as a vehicle for sexual material.
The firestorm of criticism has not totally died down after several years,
partly because of the opening lines <p>

"Westbury High School student Jeff Noxon's homework was rudely
 interrupted recently when he stumbled across the world's most sophisticated
 pornography ring."
 -posted on com-priv@psi.com July 11, 1991 by Abernathy <p>

Abernathy weathered the criticism and went on to write about other Internet
events.Some people forgave him for his initial article; others did not.
People feel strongly about the Internet...and about sex. The clashes occur
on the network and in discussions about access to pictures, jokes,
discussions, and stories. These are all found in Usenet, where some of the
most popular news groups are the controversial alt (for alternate)
hierarchy. Estimates place the readership of alt.binaries.pictures.erotica
at 150,000 in August 1993. 853 messages were posted, but because they were
large image files, this group accounted for about 43 megabytes of traffic
in a month whereas rec.arts.tv.soaps had 45,000 readers, 5125 messages
accounting for about 10.5 megabytes per month. About 56% of the Usenet
sites receive the erotica group. Why don't the others? There are many
reasons. Some administrators consider all of the alt.groups a waste of disk
space and cpu time; others omit the picture groups because of the file size
and sometimes because of the content. For instance, Apple does not carry
the picture groups because of copyright problems with some of the scanned
images, and the administrator does not have time to figure out which
present intellectual property problems and which do not. Other firms are
concerned about sexual harassment charges from employees who find the
material offensive, so the manager removes it. In some cases, women have
complained when the groups were removed, even more than male readers. Using
gopher and a little perseverance any of the Usenet groups can be accessed,
even those that have been dropped from the Usenet master list of your home
machine. <p>

Public Archives <p>

In addition there are public (ftp) archives that contain controversial
material. Some of these may show up in a gopher listing; other archive
lists are passed among interested parties. Usually, they are not posted
because the flood of ftp sessions would slow down the file server.In one
case several years ago, administrators ruled that public directories on the
university system should not devote space to nudes and X-rated images. The
solution was for each individual to copy favorite files into the personal
directory (some on the same machine). This took up much more room than
having a central, public file, but it permitted the university from totally
removing the files. <p>

It is my opinion that the number of files that will offend are hidden by
the vast total number of files available, but the resource discovery tools
are being sharpened, polished, and are easier to use. This will bring more
people online, and the curious will be able to cruise the backwaters of the
Net with relative ease. Many will come back to share their adventures. <p>

Many cultures express concern about cultural disintegration by trying to
keep out alien influences: rock music, foreign languages, other political
ideas, alternative ways for men and women to relate to each other, poetry,
This will be done by stressing the negative points of the outside influence
and the strengths of the home culture. Because more traditional and
sometimes authoritarian groups (countries, companies, Indian nations, and
religions) have a growing presence on the Internet, they will be looking
for ways of filtering what their users see and use as access is extended. <p>

We are working with some Indian tribes to put historical photographs and
artwork online to share with others. One museum curator showed me some
photographs repatriated from the Smithsonian to the tribe. "Actually, these
will only be available to initiated males over 14 years old." The
photographs of the sacred dances (and the dances themselves) must be
protected. So there is a constant tension between the Indians wish to make
information available and to protect sacred information. <p>

I hope the few issues that I have raised will generate discussion in the
library community because we have strong ideals of openness that are not
always well understood in a new environment like the Internet. If our role
as guides, editors, and electronic librarians is valid, we will have to
repeatedly confront these challenges. <p>

News from the cipher front <p>

From: strnlght@netcom.com (David Sternlight)
Subject: News from the cipher front
Date: 27 Oct 93 18:36:16 GMT
Organization: DSI/USCRPAC <p>

Ciphertext, the RSA newsletter (v1 n1, Fall 1993) showed up in my mailbox
this week. It contains much useful and interesting information, as well as
an announcement of RSA's 1994 conference on January 12-14. What follows are
some digested excerpts, posted with permission. <p>

On the Clipper front there is a very useful and non-polemical summary of the
technical aspects of Clipper by Paul Fahn, and an article by Martin Hellman.
Hellman is a Distinguished Associate of RSA Laboratories, one of the
inventors of Public Key technology, and a Professor of Electrical
Engineering at Stanford. He's not happy with Clipper as presently proposed,
and says why.  Since the article is based on his NIST testimony, the latter
can be obtained by anonymous ftp at isl.stanford.edu in
/pubs/hellman/nist.clipper.text. <p>

The third annual RSA Data Security Conference is at Redwood Shores, CA. It
costs $245 per person. There is no Onsite registration. Deadline is Friday
12/17/93. For details contact RSA. Registration is limited to 400 and
includes the conference, tutorials, and hardcopy conference proceedings, as
well as a cocktail reception, and breakfast and lunch on all three days. <p>

Apple Ships RSA Digital Signature in Long-Awaited System 7 Pro. On October
4th, Apple Computer introduced millions of new users to the RSA Digital
Signature. The producs are called PowerTalk and PowerShare and are part of
System 7 Pro, a new version of the Mac operating system. They include five
components, integrated into the operating system--Messaging, Electronic Mail
Directories, Privacy and Authentication, and Digital Signatures. They also
include RSA's RC4 symmetric stream cipher for server-to-server link
encryption. Powertalk is compliant with the Public Key Cryptography
Standards, and users will receive a voucher for a free unaffiliated
"residential digital certificate, good for use with any secure PKCS or
Internet PEM-compliant application. <p>

The Apple System 7 Pro implementation is PEM-certificate compatible, and the
messages are as well.  (For those who want privacy, RIPEM Mac operates with
the key pair generated by the Mac.) There is an API to the sign/verify
functions of the MacOS so that any app developer can use the features
without needing to license from RSA. Of course, the MacOS with RSA Digital
Signatures is fully exportable. RSA has a free signer utility for
Windows that is compatible with the Mac sigs. <p>

Internet Privacy Enhanced Mail Arrives. Several commercial and freeware
versions are available right now: <p>

TechMail, written at MIT, is a complete mail reading program for Macintosh
and (soon) Windows. It includes full implementation of the Internet PEM
RFCs, using RSA's TIPEM toolkit as its security engine. It is a client of
the Internet Post Office Protocol. Techmail for the Mac is available from
net.dist.mit.edu in pub/TechMail. It runs on SLIP or non-SLIP. (Poster's
note: The SLIP version incudes PEM and works fine. I haven't tested the
non-slip version and am not sure if it yet includes PEM.) <p>

TIS/PEM and T-Mail are non-commercial freeware and commercial supported
versions, respectively, of Trusted Information Systems implementations of
Internet PEM. The former was developed under contract with ARPA and
agreement with RSADSI and is available in source code for academic research
or exploratory use by corportions or individuals on the Internet. For more
information send e-mail to tispem-support@tis.com. <p>

TIPEM 1.1 is the latest release of RSA's Toolkit for Interoperable
Privacy-Enhanced Messaging. It permits creating applications that comply
with the Internet PEM standards as well as the commercial Public Key
Cryptography Standards (PKCS) established by vendors including Lotus, Apple,
Novell, and Microsoft. The toolkit was used for Apple's Powertalk. It is
available directly from RSA Data Security Inc. <p>

RIPEM is another freeware public key encryption program designed for
Internet PEM. It implements a subset of PEM as described in RFC's 1421-1424
The internet host ripem.msu.edu acts as a RIPEM key server for users who
choose to register their keys. It is available via anonymous ftp from
rsa.com and non-anonymous ftp from ripem.msu.edu. <p>

RSA Certificate Services Center Opens for Business. This article describes
the center RSA has established to get ral certificates with your name,
public key, and organizational affiliation safely embedded in a
cryptographically tamper-proof digital document. This provides the digital
ID for Apple Powertalk, Internet Privacy-Enhanced Mail, or any X.509
certificate-based secure application. <p>

The center allows you to issue your own affiliated certificates using RSA's
Certificate Issuing System; or the Certificate Services Center can issue
affiliated certificates for you, or you can purchase individual unaffiliated
certificates directly from the CSC. Revocation services are also provided,
as are certificate verification services. Users of Apple's System 7 PRO may
get their first certificate free. (Poster's note--as I understand it,
subsequent individual certificates are $25.) For more information contact
George Parsons, CSC Manager at 415-595-8782. <p>

700 Club Report on the Clipper Chip on Wednesday, October 20, 1993 <p>

Date: Tue, 2 Nov 93 04:08:13 -0800
From: mlshew@netcom.com (Mark Shewmaker)
To: cypherpunks@toad.com <p>

On October 20, 1993, the 700 Club gave a report on the Clipper chip.
The report was fantastic.  If you want to convince people why the
chip is so very dangerous, and why cryptographic freedoms are so
important, I recommend that you take a good look at this. <p>

Most people don't take to overly technical explanations of things,
at least for the first round of explanations.  This is an excellent
model of starter explanation for such people. <p>

I've included a transcript of the show's Clipper segments. <p>

Notice one important thing:  The report is not overtly religious in
tone.  It does not need to be.  Encryption and privacy issues cut
across many political and religious lines.  There is no need to
alienate the people you are trying to convince by insulting their
group affiliations. <p>

Notes on the transcript:  It includes only the Clipper-chip segments.
The transcript is in three sections.  The first is from the intro to
the show where they show clips of future segments of that days show,
the second is the pre-commercial "Next: The Clipper chip, here on the
700 Club", and the last is the actual report. <p>

All typos and inaccuracies are mine.  The editing I did to the report
is: (1) remove "uh"'s (2) try to add returns in order to put the speech's
format into some semblance of paragraph form for easier reading, and
(3) change one case of two people talking simultaneously (at the end)
to one person saying a few words, followed by the other saying a few words. <p>

People in the report:  Ben Kinchlow and Terry Meeuwsen are the hosts,
who talk about the stories between themselves, and Julia Zaher is the
reporter for the story.  She speaks both in a voiceover to the report,
and in the report, interviewing Jerry Berman, Lynn McNulty, Lance Hoffman,
and of course Dorothy Denning. <p>

By the way, they showed the Clipper chip itself!  Or, at least they
showed something they claimed to be the Clipper chip.  Unfortunately,
there was no close-up, just the chip in someone's hand, with the chip
taking about a sixteenth of the screen.  It looked like a 28 pin PLCC
package, with the cheaper tin plated leads.  Odd that there are so few pins. <p>

Here's the transcript: <p>

[The following was clipped from the intros to the that day's topics] <p>

Ben Kinchlow:
               We've also got a word of caution for you because
               very soon, if you're familiar with this song:
               _Every_Move_You_Make,_Every_ _Step_You_Take:  The
               federal government could be watching you! <p>

Jerry Berrman:
                We are going to conduct our lives in electronic
                media:  Order our movies, order our television
                shows, decide what schools we send our children
                to, what programs we want to, what products we
                want to buy, what magazines we want downloaded
                into our homes. <p>

Ben Kinchlow:
               And if you're a big fan of large government, this
               tiny computer chip could now give the government,
               Big Brother, instant access to every detail of your
               private life. <p>

And we'll have details of that still to come. <p>

Terry? <p>

Terry Meeuwsen:
                 Right...Scary. <p>

---
[The following is the pre-commercial message.]
--- <p>

Ben Kinchlow:
               Well coming up next... The clipper computer chip. <p>

It could be a key to invading your privacy. <p>

We'll have that for you as the 700 club continues. <p>

---
[The following is the actual report.]
--- <p>

Terry Meeuwsen: The famous line from the book _1984_ was
                "Big Brother is watching you", and in the future,
                that could prove to be true. <p>

How would Big Brother watch you? <p>

What method would he use? <p>

Some privacy experts fear the means could be--
                a computer chip.  CBN News correspondent
                Julia Zaher brings us the story from Washington. <p>

Julia Zaher:
(voiceover)
            The way we communicate is changing rapidly.  It won't
            be long before our telephone, our computer, and
            perhaps even our television will all be one device. <p>

Jerry Berman of the Electronic Frontier Foundation
            says we'll use that device to conduct most of our
            daily business, our personal business; and for some of
            us, our professional business. <p>

Jerry Berrman: <p>

We are going to conduct our lives in electronic
                media:  Order our movies, order our television
                shows, decide what schools we send our children
                to, what programs we want, what products we want
                to buy, what magazines we want downloaded into our
                homes. <p>

Julia Zaher:
(voiceover)
              Berman and others in the communications and computer
              industries welcome the innovative technology, but
              they also worry that a new danger is threatening the
              privacy of every American. The danger is that a
              computerized record of nearly all of our activities
              will be constantly accumulating.  That record could
              show virtually every move we make, from what we buy,
              to how much money we make, to what political causes
              we support. <p>

To protect our privacy, Berman and others believes,
              more people will start doing what the government and
              the military have done for decades:  Add scrambling
              devices to telephones and computers, to keep
              outsiders from tapping into important information
              and conversations.  That process of coding and
              decoding information is called encryption. <p>

Jerry Berrman:
                Today we don't think of encrypting our
                communications, but it will be done with a flick
                of a button. <p>

Julia Zaher:
(voiceover)
              Already, AT&amp;T makes a scrambling device for
              telephones.  Many businesses, especially those with
              overseas offices, use these scrambling devices
              routinely. <p>

They also take advantage of the almost 300 computer
              software programs available to code and decode
              computer programs and electronic mail. <p>

The Clinton administration has taken a great
              interest in this information revolution, and the
              government has invented its own scrambling device. <p>

Lynn McNulty:
               This is one of the clipper chips.  The chip itself
               costs about twenty-five dollars. <p>

Julia Zaher:
(voiceover)
              The new invention is known as the Clipper chip.  The
              chip is supposed to provide the strongest possible
              method of coding phone, FAX, and computer
              transmissions to prevent unwanted eavesdropping. <p>

The chip is supposed to be on the market soon. <p>

Lynn McNulty is with the National Institute of
              Standards and Technology, known as NIST for short. <p>

President Clinton has commissioned NIST to help make
              the Clipper chip the highest standard for scrambling
              information.  The White House wants to see more
              businesses and individuals use the Clipper chip to
              protect their communications once it's on the market. <p>

The reportedly unbreakable scrambling code in the
              chip would be a big plus in the fight to keep
              information private. <p>

But there's a catch. <p>

Lynn McNulty:
               A good part of the technical details of the, that
               underlie the standard will not be made public,
               which is a departure from the way we've done
               business in the past. <p>

Julia Zaher:
(voiceover)
              The details of how Clipper works and the keys that
              can break the code are all being kept secret by the
              government. <p>

That has nearly everyone in the computer and
              communications industries alarmed. <p>

Lance Hoffman is a computer science and encryption
              coding and decoding expert. <p>

Lance Hoffman:
                The administration wants to control the whole
                process, and wants the government to control all
                the keys, is what it boils down to--that's the
                real problem. <p>

Julia Zaher:
(voiceover)
              The government says it alone must hold the keys that
              can break Clipper's private scrambling code.  That
              would mean that only government agencies could
              eavesdrop on computer and telephone transmissions.
              Private agencies, or individuals like private
              detectives couldn't do it. <p>

The FBI and other law enforcement agencies say,
              instead of getting court orders for wiretaps, in the
              future they'll be routinely requesting codes that
              are scrambling computers and telephones. <p>

Dorothy Denning is one of the five outside computer
              experts who had the chance to examine the Clipper
              chip and try to break its code. <p>

Julia Zaher:
              And what happened? <p>

Dorothy Denning:
                  I failed.  I didn't break it. <p>

Julia Zaher:
              There was no way you could break it? <p>

Dorothy Denning:
                  There was no way I could break it. <p>

Julia Zaher:
(voiceover)
              Denning is one of the very few people in the
              computer science field who sees no danger in the
              government holding the only keys that can break
              Clipper's code. <p>

Dorothy Denning:
                  ...And this initiative does not in any way to
                  expand the government's authority to intercept
                  communications. <p>

Julia Zaher:
(voiceover)
              Denning also says Clipper's unbreakable code would
              make it more difficult for police or the FBI to do
              illegal wiretaps. <p>

But Hoffman and many others disagree.  They say that
              all of the secrecy about how clipper works, combined
              with the government alone holding the keys to break
              the code, would put the privacy of everyone using
              clipper in jeopardy. <p>

Hoffman says that while the chip is just one of many
              scrambling devices now, the government could
              eventually argue that everyone coding their
              information must use clipper <p>

Lance Hoffman:
                There's no reason they couldn't change their mind
                at a later point and say "well we tried it
                voluntari..." "We tried it as a voluntary measure,
                it doesn't work, so now it's going to be
                mandatory." <p>

Julia Zaher:
(voiceover)
              Privacy advocates like Jerry Berman point out the
              government has been known to spy on citizens when it
              believes they hold dangerous political opinions. <p>

Jerry Berrman:
                There are good governments, there are bad
                governments.  We've gone through abusive periods
                where we've had intelligence agencies chasing
                different political dissidents from the right and
                left around. <p>

We worry about these things. <p>

Julia Zaher:
(reporting)
              Computer coding and decoding standards may all seem
              irrelevant at this point, but they'll be important
              in the future to protect your privacy. <p>

The government's Clipper chip is the most powerful
              coding and decoding device developed so far. <p>

It hasn't been decided yet if Clipper will be the one
              national standard used to protect electronic
              privacy, but if it is, it could also pose the
              greatest threat, if those decoding keys, held by the
              government, fall into the wrong hands. <p>

Julia Zaire, CBN News, Washington. <p>

Ben Kinchlow:
               And some of us would say that the wrong hands for
               them to fall into is the government!  You know. <p>

What your talking about here, essentially, is a
               giant superhighway.  This is what the President,
               Vice-President Gore is recommending--that we have
               this super-highway, which on the surface is
               wonderful.  It enables us all across the world to hook up and,
               you know, exchange information and communications
               with people, and that's a wonderful idea, and we
               need to take full advantage of what's going on in
               technology today:  Marvelous things. <p>

Like one of our cameramen is hooked up to something
               called Internet, where you can pull out files from
               the university of Tokyo, if you will. <p>

I mean, it's a wonderful idea. <p>

The problem is, when the government comes in and
               starts saying, "The only" I mean, everybody has
               this scrambling device, but the only people who
               can unscramble this device is the government. <p>

But the government says that "we must have this"
               in order to track down criminals and terrorists. <p>

The problem is, "criminals and terrorists"
               eventually become who the government says
               "criminals and terrorists" are. <p>

And it will not be long before anybody who
               disagrees with the government, then, can become a
               criminal, and his whole activities can be tracked
               down. <p>

And indeed what Orwell said about 1984 becomes a
               reality. <p>

The Big Brother has the capacity to watch you,
               track you. <p>

And by the way, interestingly enough, they do
               have, and have developed, a small uh <p>

Terry Meeuwsen:
                 Oh, I don't want to know this <p>

Ben Kinchlow:
               tracking device that goes under <p>

Terry Meeuwsen:
                 Under the skin? <p>

Ben Kinchlow:
               under your skin.  In fact, they used some of it,
               according to one report I read, over in the war
               that just took place in the middle east, so they
               could track our men by satellite. <p>

Terry Meeuwsen:
                 Well, you know [sigh], the bottom line is that
                 it's the same thing we've been hearing day after
                 day after day: More government control, more
                 government control. So, we need to hear that... <p>

Ben Kinchlow:

New EFF Infrastructure Policy Statement: The Open Platform Campaign <p>

The recent spate of telecommunications mergers -- Bell Atlantic/TCI, US
West/Time-Warner, AT&amp;T/McCaw, plus numerous others in the works -- raise
the stakes for information policy makers and those of us who are concerned
about the development of an open, accessible information infrastructure. <p>

EFF has just released a major new statement on our Open Platform Campaign,
which explains EFF's approach to infrastructure policy.  Our big concern is
encourage Congess and the Administration to do the right thing and set out
a new, positive communications policy that is ready for the information
age.  We believe that this policy must achieve the following goals: <p>

*       Diversity of Information Sources:  Promote a fully interactive
        infrastructure in which the First Amendment flourishes,
        allowing the greatest possible diversity of view points; <p>

*       Universal Service:  Ensure a minimum level of affordable
        information and communication service for all Americans; <p>

*       Free Speech and Common Carriage:  Guarantee infrastructure
        access regardless of the content of the message that the
        user is sending; <p>

*       Privacy:  Protect the security and privacy of all
        communications carried over the infrastructure, and
        safeguard the Fourth and Fifth Amendment rights of all
        who use the information infrastructure; <p>

*       Development of Public Interest Applications and Services:
        Ensure that public interest applications and services
        which are not produced by the commercial market are
        widely available and affordable. <p>

Our policy proposal, available by anonymous ftp on ftp.eff.org in
/pub/eff/papers/op2.0, contains a discussion of these principles and
concrete legislative recommendations on how to accomplish many of these
goals.  Here are a few selected paragraphs from the main paper to give a
flavor of our positions, but we hope you'll read the whole thing. <p>

"Regulatory changes should be made, and mergers approved or barred
based on specific, enforceable commitments that the electronic
superhighways will meet public goals and realize the potential of digital
technology.  That potential arises from the extraordinary spaciousness of
the broadband information highway, contrasted with the scarcity of
broadcast spectrum and the limited number of cable channels that defined
the mass media era.  Properly constructed and administered, the information
highway has enough capacity to permit passage not only for a band of
channels controlled by the network operator, but also for a common carriage
connection that is open to all who wish to speak, publish, and communicate
on the digital information highway.  For the first time, electronic media
can have the diversity of information we associate only with the print
media." <p>

But we can't rely on the promises of industry or the wonders of the
competitive marketplace alone to create this infrastructure.  We need
legislative benchmarks to ensure that all citizens have access to advanced
information infrastructure.  We will achieve this goal not by having
government build the whole thing, but by finding a new communications
policy framework that works for the market and brings benefits to
consumers. <p>

We've expanded the concept of "Open Platform Services" from just narrowband
ISDN, to include any switched, digital service, offered on a common
carriage basis, by any provider. <p>

"To achieve the full potential of new digital media, we need to
make available what we call Open Platform services, which reach all
American homes, businesses, schools, libraries, and government
institutions.  Open Platform service will enable children at home to tie
into their school library (or libraries all around the world) to do their
homework.  It will make it possible for a parent who makes a video of the
local elementary school soccer game to share it with parents and students
throughout the community.  Open Platform will make it as easy to be an
information provider as it is to be an information consumer." <p>

"Open Platform services provide basic information access
connections, just as today's telephone line allows your to connect to an
information service or the coaxial cable running into your home connects
you to cable television programming.   This is not a replacement for
current online services such as America Online or Compuserve, but rather is
the basic transport capacity that one needs to access the multimedia
version of these information services. <p>

"Specifically, Open Platform service must meet the following criteria: <p>

*       widely available, switched digital connections;
*       affordable prices;
*       open access to all without discrimination as the content
        of the message;
*       sufficient "up-stream" capacity to enable users to
        originate, as well as receive, good quality video,
        multimedia services. <p>

"Open Platform service itself will be provided by a variety of providers
over interconnected networks, using a variety of wires, fiber optics, coax
cable, and wireless transmission services.  But however it is provided, if
it is affordable and widely available, it will be the on-ramp for the
nation's growing information superhighway." <p>

Rather than a narrow focus on stopping or delaying the proposed mergers,
policy makers should use the leverage of the moment to create a new
Communications Act that serves the public interest. <p>

"The Administration and Congress can create an prompt the
deployment of open platforms by using the political leverage at its
disposal.  Bell Atlantic, TCI, Time Warner, US West and others involved in
recent mergers are all promising to build open platforms.
Telecommunications giants are asking policymakers for permission to enter
new markets or to form new, merged entities.  Rather than per se opposition
to current mergers, or mere reliance on competition to build the data
highways, make the mergers and other accommodations conditional on
providing affordable open platform services.  The terms of this new social
contract should be written into a new Communications Act, revised for the
information age.  With a real "social contract" in hand, we just might
realize the Jeffersonian potential of the data superhighways. " <p>

"Together with a coalition of public interest groups and private
industry, the Electronic Frontier Foundation is working to establish Open
Platform objectives in concrete legislation.  Open Platform provisions,
which would cause near term deployment of Open Platform services, are
present in both the recent Senate infrastructure bill and the latest draft
of House telecommunications legislation, soon to be introduced.  We are
also working with the Administration to have Open Platform policies
included in the recommendations of the Information Infrastructure Task
Force.  In addition to federal policy, critical decisions about the shape
of the information infrastructure will be made at state and local levels.
Since 1991, EFF has been working with a number state legislatures and
public utility commissions to have affordable, digital services offered at
a local level.  As cable and telephone infrastructures converge, we will
also work with local cable television franchising authorities.  We invite
all who are concerned about these issues to join with us in these public
policy efforts." <p>

We hope that everyone will have a look at our new proposal, and join in to
help us. <p>

                U.S. CODE AGENCY IS JOSTLING FOR CIVILIAN TURF
    
  ***  Hastily Scanned.  No authority for redistribution granted *** <p>

New York Times, Monday, January 24, 1994
By John Markoff <p>

The National Security agency is trying to establish a standard tor
electronically scrambling computer communications, a move that would go far
beyond the agency's usual military and intelligence domain to include
civilian activities like electronic tax returns and computerized medical
payments.
The plan by the N.S.A., which may be announced as early as today, worries
business executives, who fear a Government encroachment on privacy. And
some officials in the Clinton Administration believe that the N.S.A. is
overstepping its bounds.
  The N.S.A. is the Federal agency responsible for electronic surveillance
of global communications, though usually not civilian communlcations,
within the United States.
  But in an era when everyday business is increasingly conducted over
computer networks, and when much of that electronic commerce is transmitted
in scrambled form to prevent eavesdropping or theft of information, the
agency is intent on having Government and civilian computer users employ a
standard approach to scrambling.
  That way, after-obtaining a court's permission, law-enforcement officials
would have a way of cracking codes. <p>

Bidding Process <p>

The agency will seek bids from companies to produce circuit cards based
on its technology, which would be used to scramble electronic messages for
Government agencies and, eventually, private companies. Agency employees
confirmed the plan late Friday, though no agency officials could be reached
over the weekend for further details.
  The Internal Revenue Service, the Government agency that has the most
electronic communication with the public, has already started testing the
system. "We need to know what the administrative issues are with this
technology," said Henry Philcox, the tax agency's chief information
officer.
Many computer industry executives oppose the National Security Agency's
effort, saying there is no way for industry experts and outsiders to
determine the reliability and security of the underlying scrambling
technology, which the agency intends to keep secret.
  Privacy-rights advocates, meanwhile, are wary of the system because of
the electronic "back door" it contains, permitting Government
eavesdropping. And some other Administration officials say the agency is
going too far by pushing the standard into civilian computing
  "What these guys are trying to do is run ahead of the blocking," an
Administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity said.
"Trying to sell this as the wave of the future is premature as
Administration policy.
The circuit card, which is designed to fit into a personal computer and
which the agency calls Tessera, is based on technology similar to a device
known as the Clipper Chip, a telephone voice-scrambling chip that provides
a back-door means for letting law-enforcement officials eavesdrop.
  The Clipper plan, developed by the National Security Agency in
cooperation with the National Insatute for Standards and Technology, a
Commerce Department agency, was announced in April by the Clinton
Administration. It has been almost universally opposed by computer and
telecommunications executives and by public policy groups.
  In a letter to be sent to President Clinton today, which was released on
Friday to The New York Times, a group of 38 of the nation's leading
computer scientists, computer-security specialists and privacy experts have
urged that the Clipper program be stopped.
  "The current proposal was developed in secret by Federal agencies
primarily concerned about electronic surveillance, not privacy protection,"
the letter states. "Critical aspects of the plan remain classified and thus
beyond public review."
  The letter was signed by most of the civilian pioneers of modern
cryptography, including Whitfield Diffie of Sun Microsystems, Ralph C
Merkle of the Xerox Corporation, Martin Hellman of Stanford University and
Ronald Rivest of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
  While there has been no other indication so far that the Government wants
to torce private industry to use Clipper or Tessera technolo8ies, their
adoption as Government and military standards could go a long way toward
making them de facto standards. The Federal and military markets are some
of the largest for the computer and communications industrles, and the
Government has the power to determine what sorts of advanced technology can
be exported.
  Moreover, the Government could insure widespread use of the Clipper and
Tessera technologies by insisting that they be used by businesses and
individuals when communicating electronically with Federal agencies. <p>

Official Reasoning <p>

Law-enforcement officials say the technologies are intended to resolve a
longstanding problem of the information age: how to preserve the right of
businesses and citizens to use codes to protect all sorts of digltal
communications without letting criminals and terrorists conspire beyond the
law's reach. Businesses and individuals who often communicate over computer
networks already make use of a variety of scrambling systems-either of
their own devising or those commercially available.
  Many of these scrambling systems are unbreakable by anyone who does not
hold the electronic keys to the code, something generally known only by the
sender and the recipient of scrambled messages.
  That is a problem for the National Security Agency, which routinely
listens to many of the world~s telephone and computer conversations -
although it has no jurisdiction for moni toring non-Government
conversations within the United States. The N.S.A.'s Tessera and Clipper
systems would have an independent agency hold master keys to the codes,
which could be obtained with a court's permission for surveillance by
law-enforcement officials.
  The agency plans initially to purchase 10,000 to 70,000 of the Tessera
cards for its use and that of the Pentagon. In an industry briefin8 held
earlier this month, however, N.S.A. officials proposed the eventual use of
the secure communications card in a vast range of civilian and Government
applications including some by the Internal Revenue Service, the
Departments of Health and Hurnan Services, Justice and State and in the
Senate and the House.
  The agency also suggested that the card could be used for civilian
functions like electronic mail and in the scrambling systems employed in
cable television.
The National Security Agency's new standard-setting effort is being
introduced a couple of weeks before the Clinton Administration completes a
classified review of the Clipper proposal, and several industry executives
said the announcement had been timed to apply pressure to the
Administration's decision making.
  The proposal angers industry executives who believe that the agency is
rushing to establish a de facto standard that will undercut efforts to
adopt a competing commercial standard without a built-in back door. That
standard, being developed by RSA Data Security, a Redwood City, Calif.,
software company, has been endorsed by the nation's leading computer
makers, software developers and telecommunications companies. <p>

Secret Formula <p>

These companies are particularly troubled by the National Security
Agency~s refusal to disclose the mathematical formula, or algorithm, on
which-its scrambling technology is based.
  "The issue here is: Should a secret algorithm developed by the
intelligence community be used for unclassified civilian uses?" said
Stephen Walker, a computer security industry executive and a member of the
Government's Computer System Security and Privacy Advisory Board.  l think
the answer is it should not.
  The agency has increasingly come into conflict with industry and public !
policy groups who argue that independent and public coding technology is
essential if the nation is to develop a viable electronic commerce system.
  "These Government surveillance plans focus on limiting public privacy at
a time when everyone is calling for more privacy," said Marc Rotenberg, .
Washington director of Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility, a
public interest group that organized the letter that will be sent to
President Clinton today. "Privacy is a key part of the national information
infrastructure, and the decisions the Administration is making are leaning
l in the wrong direction."
  The new security standard is being proposed at a time the National
Security Agency is trying to redefine its role after the cold war, and it
raises questions in critics' minds about whether the agency is overstepping
its authority. The 1988 Computer Security Act limited the N.S.A.'s computer
security role to military and intelligence agencies.
  "These guys are fighting for job secyrity," said William Ferguson, vice
president of Semaphore Inc., a , Santa Clara, Calif., computer network
security firm. "Now that the K.G.B. has gone commercial, the N.S.A. is
trying to start its own initiatives that say, 'all we're trying to do i is
keep up with the K.G.B.' "
  White House officials said the agency's actions would not necessarily
force the Administration to authorize, an unpopular coding technology.
One official said the Administration policy review was likely to establish
a permanent working group that, would limit the National Security, Agency's
role in policy making.
  The N.S.A. originally planned to announce its request for proposals on
Friday. But the notice was delayed because the Government shut down
Thursday in response to the frigid weather that disrupted the supply of
electricity in Washington and other parts of the East. The agency
tentatively plans to award contracts for the Tessera card by March 25. <p>

                    CPSR, ETC URGE CLINTON TO DROP CLIPPER
                                       
[FYI -- "today" seems to mean Jan 24th 94. -meng] <p>

More than three dozen of the nation's leading cryptographers,
computer security specialists and privacy experts today urged
President Clinton to abandon the controversial Clipper encryption
proposal.  The letter was coordinated by Computer Professionals
for Social Responsibility (CPSR), which has long sought to open
the issue of cryptography policy to public debate <p>

The group cited the secrecy surrounding the proposal,
widespread public opposition to the plan and privacy concerns as
reasons why the initiative should not go forward. <p>

The letter comes at a crucial point in the debate on
cryptography policy.  An internal Administration review of the
issue is nearing completion and the National Security Agency (NSA)
is moving forward with efforts to deploy Clipper technology in
civilian agencies, including the Internal Revenue Service. <p>

CPSR has sponsored several public conferences on
cryptography and privacy and has litigated Freedom of Informa-
tion Act cases seeking the disclosure of relevant government
documents.  In one pending FOIA case, CPSR is challenging the
secrecy of the Skipjack algorithm which underlies the Clipper
proposal. <p>

============================================================= <p>

January 24, 1994 <p>

The President
The White House
Washington, DC  20500 <p>

Dear Mr. President, <p>

We are writing to you regarding the "Clipper" escrowed
encryption proposal now under consideration by the White House.
We wish to express our concern about this plan and similar
technical standards that may be proposed for the nation's
communications infrastructure. <p>

The current proposal was developed in secret by federal
agencies primarily concerned about electronic surveillance, not
privacy protection.  Critical aspects of the plan remain
classified and thus beyond public review. <p>

The private sector and the public have expressed nearly
unanimous opposition to Clipper.  In the formal request for
comments conducted by the Department of Commerce last year, less
than a handful of respondents supported the plan.  Several hundred
opposed it. <p>

If the plan goes forward, commercial firms that hope to
develop new products will face extensive government obstacles.
Cryptographers who wish to develop new privacy enhancing
technologies will be discouraged.  Citizens who anticipate that
the progress of technology will enhance personal privacy will
find their expectations unfulfilled. <p>

Some have proposed that Clipper be adopted on a voluntary
basis and suggest that other technical approaches will remain
viable.  The government, however, exerts enormous influence in the
marketplace, and the likelihood that competing standards would
survive is small.  Few in the user community believe that the
proposal would be truly voluntary. <p>

The Clipper proposal should not be adopted.  We believe that
if this proposal and the associated standards go forward, even on
a voluntary basis, privacy protection will be diminished,
innovation will be slowed, government accountability will be
lessened, and the openness necessary to ensure the successful
development of the nation's communications infrastructure will be
threatened. <p>

We respectfully ask the White House to withdraw the Clipper
proposal. <p>

Sincerely, <p>

Source:  Neil Postman, German Informatics Society, 11 Oct 90, Stuttgart <p>

INFORMING OURSELVES TO DEATH
                       ____________________________
                             by Neil Postman <p>

The great English playwright and social philosopher George Bernard
Shaw once remarked that all professions are conspiracies against the
common folk.  He meant that those who belong to elite trades -
physicians, lawyers, teachers, and scientists - protect their special
status by creating vocabularies that are incomprehensible to the
general public.  This process prevents outsiders from understanding
what the profession is doing and why - and protects the insiders from
close examination and criticism.  Professions, in other words, build
forbidding walls of technical gobbledegook over which the prying and
alien eye cannot see. <p>

Unlike George Bernard Shaw, I raise no complaint against this, for I
consider myself a professional teacher and appreciate technical
gobbledegook as much as anyone.  But I do not object if occasionally
someone who does not know the secrets of my trade is allowed entry to
the inner halls to express an untutored point of view.  Such a person
may sometimes give a refreshing opinion or, even better, see something
in a way that the professionals have overlooked. <p>

I believe I have been invited to speak at this conference for just
such a purpose.  I do not know very much more about computer
technology than the average person - which isn't very much.  I have
little understanding of what excites a computer programmer or
scientist, and in examining the descriptions of the presentations at
this conference, I found each one more mysterious than the next.  So,
I clearly qualify as an outsider. <p>

But I think that what you want here is not merely an outsider but an
outsider who has a point of view that might be useful to the insiders.
And that is why I accepted the invitation to speak. I believe I know
something about what technologies do to culture, and I know even more
about what technologies undo in a culture. In fact, I might say, at
the start, that what a technology undoes is a subject that computer
experts apparently know very little about. I have heard many experts
in computer technology speak about the advantages that computers will
bring. With one exception - namely, Joseph Weizenbaum - I have never
heard anyone speak seriously and comprehensively about the
disadvantages of computer technology, which strikes me as odd, and
makes me wonder if the profession is hiding something important. That
is to say, what seems to be lacking among computer experts is a sense
of technological modesty. <p>

After all, anyone who has studied the history of technology knows that
technological change is always a Faustian bargain: Technology giveth
and technology taketh away, and not always in equal measure.  A new
technology sometimes creates more than it destroys.  Sometimes, it
destroys more than it creates.  But it is never one-sided. <p>

The invention of the printing press is an excellent example.  Printing
fostered the modern idea of individuality but it destroyed the
medieval sense of community and social integration.  Printing created
prose but made poetry into an exotic and elitist form of expression.
Printing made modern science possible but transformed religious
sensibility into an exercise in superstition.  Printing assisted in
the growth of the nation-state but, in so doing, made patriotism into
a sordid if not a murderous emotion. <p>

Another way of saying this is that a new technology tends to favor
some groups of people and harms other groups. School teachers, for
example, will, in the long run, probably be made obsolete by
television, as blacksmiths were made obsolete by the automobile, as
balladeers were made obsolete by the printing press. Technological
change, in other words, always results in winners and losers. <p>

In the case of computer technology, there can be no disputing that the
computer has increased the power of large-scale organizations like
military establishments or airline companies or banks or tax
collecting agencies. And it is equally clear that the computer is now
indispensable to high-level researchers in physics and other natural
sciences. But to what extent has computer technology been an advantage
to the masses of people? To steel workers, vegetable store owners,
teachers, automobile mechanics, musicians, bakers, brick layers,
dentists and most of the rest into whose lives the computer now
intrudes? These people have had their private matters made more
accessible to powerful institutions.  They are more easily tracked and
controlled; they are subjected to more examinations, and are
increasingly mystified by the decisions made about them. They are more
often reduced to mere numerical objects. They are being buried by junk
mail. They are easy targets for advertising agencies and political
organizations. The schools teach their children to operate
computerized systems instead of teaching things that are more valuable
to children. In a word, almost nothing happens to the losers that they
need, which is why they are losers. <p>

It is to be expected that the winners - for example, most of the
speakers at this conference - will encourage the losers to be
enthusiastic about computer technology.  That is the way of winners,
and so they sometimes tell the losers that with personal computers the
average person can balance a checkbook more neatly, keep better track
of recipes, and make more logical shopping lists.  They also tell them
that they can vote at home, shop at home, get all the information they
wish at home, and thus make community life unnecessary.  They tell
them that their lives will be conducted more efficiently, discreetly
neglecting to say from whose point of view or what might be the costs
of such efficiency. <p>

Should the losers grow skeptical, the winners dazzle them with the
wondrous feats of computers, many of which have only marginal
relevance to the quality of the losers' lives but which are
nonetheless impressive.  Eventually, the losers succumb, in part
because they believe that the specialized knowledge of the masters of
a computer technology is a form of wisdom. The masters, of course,
come to believe this as well.  The result is that certain questions do
not arise, such as, to whom will the computer give greater power and
freedom, and whose power and freedom will be reduced? <p>

Now, I have perhaps made all of this sound like a wellplanned
conspiracy, as if the winners know all too well what is being won and
what lost. But this is not quite how it happens, for the winners do
not always know what they are doing, and where it will all lead. The
Benedictine monks who invented the mechanical clock in the 12th and
13th centuries believed that such a clock would provide a precise
regularity to the seven periods of devotion they were required to
observe during the course of the day.  As a matter of fact, it did.
But what the monks did not realize is that the clock is not merely a
means of keeping track of the hours but also of synchronizing and
controlling the actions of men. And so, by the middle of the 14th
century, the clock had moved outside the walls of the monastery, and
brought a new and precise regularity to the life of the workman and
the merchant. The mechanical clock made possible the idea of regular
production, regular working hours, and a standardized product.
Without the clock, capitalism would have been quite impossible. And
so, here is a great paradox: the clock was invented by men who wanted
to devote themselves more rigorously to God; and it ended as the
technology of greatest use to men who wished to devote themselves to
the accumulat- ion of money. Technology always has unforeseen
consequences, and it is not always clear, at the beginning, who or
what will win, and who or what will lose. <p>

I might add, by way of another historical example, that Johann
Gutenberg was by all accounts a devoted Christian who would have been
horrified to hear Martin Luther, the accursed heretic, declare that
printing is "God's highest act of grace, whereby the business of the
Gospel is driven forward." Gutenberg thought his invention would
advance the cause of the Holy Roman See, whereas in fact, it turned
out to bring a revolution which destroyed the monopoly of the Church. <p>

We may well ask ourselves, then, is there something that the masters
of computer technology think they are doing for us which they and we
may have reason to regret? I believe there is, and it is suggested by
the title of my talk, "Informing Ourselves to Death".  In the time
remaining, I will try to explain what is dangerous about the computer,
and why. And I trust you will be open enough to consider what I have
to say. Now, I think I can begin to get at this by telling you of a
small experiment I have been conducting, on and off, for the past
several years. There are some people who describe the experiment as an
exercise in deceit and exploitation but I will rely on your sense of
humor to pull me through. <p>

Here's how it works: It is best done in the morning when I see a
colleague who appears not to be in possession of a copy of {The New
York Times}. "Did you read The Times this morning?," I ask. If the
colleague says yes, there is no experiment that day. But if the answer
is no, the experiment can proceed. "You ought to look at Page 23," I
say. "There's a fascinating article about a study done at Harvard
University."  "Really? What's it about?" is the usual reply. My
choices at this point are limited only by my imagination. But I might
say something like this: "Well, they did this study to find out what
foods are best to eat for losing weight, and it turns out that a
normal diet supplemented by chocolate eclairs, eaten six times a day,
is the best approach. It seems that there's some special nutrient in
the eclairs - encomial dioxin - that actually uses up calories at an
incredible rate." <p>

Another possibility, which I like to use with colleagues who are known
to be health conscious is this one: "I think you'll want to know about
this," I say. "The neuro-physiologists at the University of Stuttgart
have uncovered a connection between jogging and reduced intelligence.
They tested more than 1200 people over a period of five years, and
found that as the number of hours people jogged increased, there was a
corresponding decrease in their intelligence. They don't know exactly
why but there it is." <p>

I'm sure, by now, you understand what my role is in the experiment: to
report something that is quite ridiculous - one might say, beyond
belief. Let me tell you, then, some of my results: Unless this is the
second or third time I've tried this on the same person, most people
will believe or at least not disbelieve what I have told them. Some-
times they say: "Really? Is that possible?" Sometimes they do a
double-take, and reply, "Where'd you say that study was done?" And
sometimes they say, "You know, I've heard something like that." <p>

Now, there are several conclusions that might be drawn from these
results, one of which was expressed by H. L. Mencken fifty years ago
when he said, there is no idea so stupid that you can't find a
professor who will believe it. This is more of an accusation than an
explanation but in any case I have tried this experiment on non-
professors and get roughly the same results. Another possible con-
clusion is one expressed by George Orwell - also about 50 years ago -
when he remarked that the average person today is about as naive as
was the average person in the Middle Ages. In the Middle Ages people
believed in the authority of their religion, no matter what. Today, we
believe in the authority of our science, no matter what. <p>

But I think there is still another and more important conclusion to be
drawn, related to Orwell's point but rather off at a right angle to
it. I am referring to the fact that the world in which we live is very
nearly incomprehensible to most of us. There is almost no fact -
whether actual or imagined - that will surprise us for very long,
since we have no comprehensive and consistent picture of the world
which would make the fact appear as an unacceptable contradiction.  We
believe because there is no reason not to believe. No social,
political, historical, metaphysical, logical or spiritual reason. We
live in a world that, for the most part, makes no sense to us. Not
even technical sense. I don't mean to try my experiment on this
audience, especially after having told you about it, but if I informed
you that the seats you are presently occupying were actually made by a
special process which uses the skin of a Bismark herring, on what
grounds would you dispute me? For all you know - indeed, for all I

know - the skin of a Bismark herring could have made the seats on
which you sit. And if I could get an industrial chemist to confirm
this fact by describing some incomprehensible process by which it was
done, you would probably tell someone tomorrow that you spent the
evening sitting on a Bismark herring. <p>

Perhaps I can get a bit closer to the point I wish to make with an
analogy: If you opened a brand-new deck of cards, and started turning
the cards over, one by one, you would have a pretty good idea of what
their order is. After you had gone from the ace of spades through the
nine of spades, you would expect a ten of spades to come up next. And
if a three of diamonds showed up instead, you would be surprised and
wonder what kind of deck of cards this is. But if I gave you a deck
that had been shuffled twenty times, and then asked you to turn the
cards over, you would not expect any card in particular - a three of
diamonds would be just as likely as a ten of spades. Having no basis
for assuming a given order, you would have no reason to react with
disbelief or even surprise to whatever card turns up. <p>

The point is that, in a world without spiritual or intellectual order,
nothing is unbelievable; nothing is predictable, and therefore,
nothing comes as a particular surprise. <p>

In fact, George Orwell was more than a little unfair to the average
person in the Middle Ages. The belief system of the Middle Ages was
rather like my brand-new deck of cards. There existed an ordered,
comprehensible world-view, beginning with the idea that all knowledge
and goodness come from God. What the priests had to say about the
world was derived from the logic of their theology. There was nothing
arbitrary about the things people were asked to believe, including the
fact that the world itself was created at 9 AM on October 23 in the
year 4004 B. C. That could be explained, and was, quite lucidly, to
the satisfaction of anyone. So could the fact that 10,000 angels could
dance on the head of a pin. It made quite good sense, if you believed
that the Bible is the revealed word of God and that the universe is
populated with angels. The medieval world was, to be sure, mysterious
and filled with wonder, but it was not without a sense of order.
Ordinary men and women might not clearly grasp how the harsh realities
of their lives fit into the grand and benevolent design, but they had
no doubt that there was such a design, and their priests were well
able, by deduction from a handful of principles, to make it, if not
rational, at least coherent. <p>

The situation we are presently in is much different. And I should say,
sadder and more confusing and certainly more mysterious. It is rather
like the shuffled deck of cards I referred to. There is no consistent,
integrated conception of the world which serves as the foundation on
which our edifice of belief rests. And therefore, in a sense, we are
more naive than those of the Middle Ages, and more frightened, for we
can be made to believe almost anything. The skin of a Bismark herring
makes about as much sense as a vinyl alloy or encomial dioxin. <p>

Now, in a way, none of this is our fault. If I may turn the wisdom of
Cassius on its head: the fault is not in ourselves but almost
literally in the stars. When Galileo turned his telescope toward the
heavens, and allowed Kepler to look as well, they found no enchantment
or authoriza- tion in the stars, only geometric patterns and
equations. God, it seemed, was less of a moral philosopher than a
master mathematician.  This discovery helped to give impetus to the
development of physics but did nothing but harm to theology. Before
Galileo and Kepler, it was possible to believe that the Earth was the
stable center of the uni- verse, and that God took a special interest
in our affairs. Afterward, the Earth became a lonely wanderer in an
obscure galaxy in a hidden corner of the universe, and we were left to
wonder if God had any interest in us at all. The ordered,
comprehensible world of the Middle Ages began to unravel because
people no longer saw in the stars the face of a friend. <p>

And something else, which once was our friend, turned against us, as
well. I refer to information. There was a time when information was a
resource that helped human beings to solve specific and urgent
problems of their environment. It is true enough that in the Middle
Ages, there was a scarcity of information but its very scarcity made
it both important and usable. This began to change, as everyone knows,
in the late 15th century when a goldsmith named Gutenberg, from Mainz,
converted an old wine press into a printing machine, and in so
doing, created what we now call an information explosion. Forty years
after the invention of the press, there were printing machines in 110
cities in six different countries; 50 years after, more than eight
million books had been printed, almost all of them filled with
information that had previously not been available to the average
person. Nothing could be more misleading than the idea that computer
technology introduced the age of information. The printing press
began that age, and we have not been free of it since. <p>

But what started out as a liberating stream has turned into a deluge
of chaos.  If I may take my own country as an example, here is what we
are faced with: In America, there are 260,000 billboards; 11,520
newspapers; 11,556 periodicals; 27,000 video outlets for renting
tapes; 362 million tv sets; and over 400 million radios. There are
40,000 new book titles published every year (300,000 world-wide) and
every day in America 41 million photographs are taken, and just for
the record, over 60 billion pieces of advertising junk mail come into
our mail boxes every year. Everything from telegraphy and photography
in the 19th century to the silicon chip in the twentieth has amplified
the din of information, until matters have reached such proportions
today that for the average person, information no longer has any
relation to the solution of problems. <p>

The tie between information and action has been severed. Information
is now a commodity that can be bought and sold, or used as a form of
entertainment, or worn like a garment to enhance one's status. It
comes indiscriminately, directed at no one in particular, disconnected
from usefulness; we are glutted with information, drowning in
information, have no control over it, don't know what to do with it. <p>

And there are two reasons we do not know what to do with it. First, as
I have said, we no longer have a coherent conception of ourselves, and
our universe, and our relation to one another and our world. We no
longer know, as the Middle Ages did, where we come from, and where we
are going, or why. That is, we don't know what information is
relevant, and what information is irrelevant to our lives. Second, we
have directed all of our energies and intelligence to inventing
machinery that does nothing but increase the supply of information. As
a consequence, our defenses against information glut have broken down;
our information immune system is inoperable. We don't know how to
filter it out; we don't know how to reduce it; we don't know to use
it. We suffer from a kind of cultural AIDS. <p>

Now, into this situation comes the computer. The computer, as we know,
has a quality of universality, not only because its uses are almost
infinitely various but also because computers are commonly integrated
into the structure of other machines. Therefore it would be fatuous of
me to warn against every conceivable use of a computer. But there is
no denying that the most prominent uses of computers have to do with
information. When people talk about "information sciences," they are
talking about computers - how to store information, how to retrieve
information, how to organize information. The computer is an answer
to the questions, how can I get more information, faster, and in a more
usable form? These would appear to be reasonable questions. But now I
should like to put some other questions to you that seem to me more
reasonable. Did Iraq invade Kuwait because of a lack of information?
If a hideous war should ensue between Iraq and the U. S., will it
happen because of a lack of information? If children die of starvation
in Ethiopia, does it occur because of a lack of information? Does racism
in South Africa exist because of a lack of information? If criminals
roam the streets of New York City, do they do so because of a lack of
information? <p>

Or, let us come down to a more personal level: If you and your spouse
are unhappy together, and end your marriage in divorce, will it happen
because of a lack of information? If your children misbehave and bring
shame to your family, does it happen because of a lack of information?
If someone in your family has a mental breakdown, will it happen
because of a lack of information? <p>

I believe you will have to concede that what ails us, what causes us the
most misery and pain - at both cultural and personal levels - has nothing
to do with the sort of information  made accessible by computers. The
computer and its information cannot answer any of the fundamental quest-
ions we need to address to make our lives more meaningful and humane.
The computer cannot provide an organizing moral framework. It cannot
tell us what questions are worth asking. It cannot provide a means of
understanding why we are here or why we fight each other or why decency
eludes us so often, especially when we need it the most. The computer
is, in a sense, a magnificent toy that distracts us from facing what we
most needed to confront - spiritual emptiness, knowledge of ourselves,
usable conceptions of the past and future. Does one blame the computer
for this? Of course not. It is, after all, only a machine. But it is
presented to us, with trumpets blaring, as at this conference, as a
technological messiah. <p>

Through the computer, the heralds say, we will make education better,
religion better, politics better, our minds better - best of all,
ourselves better. This is, of course, nonsense, and only the young or
the ignorant or the foolish could believe it.  I said a moment ago
that computers are not to blame for this. And that is true, at least
in the sense that we do not blame an elephant for its huge appetite or
a stone for being hard or a cloud for hiding the sun.  That is their
nature, and we expect nothing different from them. But the computer
has a nature, as well. True, it is only a machine but a machine
designed to manipulate and generate information. That is what
computers do, and therefore they have an agenda and an unmistakable
message. <p>

The message is that through more and more information, more conveniently
packaged, more swiftly delivered, we will find solutions to our
problems.  And so all the brilliant young men and women, believing
this, create ingenious things for the computer to do, hoping that in
this way, we will become wiser and more decent and more noble.  And
who can blame them? By becoming masters of this wondrous technology,
they will acquire prestige and power and some will even become famous.
In a world populated by people who believe that through more and more
information, paradise is attainable, the computer scientist is king.
But I maintain that all of this is a monumental and dangerous waste of
human talent and energy.  Imagine what might be accomplished if this
talent and energy were turned to philosophy, to theology, to the arts,
to imaginative literature or to education? Who knows what we could
learn from such people - perhaps why there are wars, and hunger, and
homelessness and mental illness and anger. <p>

As things stand now, the geniuses of computer technology will give us
Star Wars, and tell us that is the answer to nuclear war. They will
give us artificial intelligence, and tell us that this is the way to
self-knowledge. They will give us instantaneous global communicat-
ion, and tell us this is the way to mutual understanding. They will
give us Virtual Reality and tell us this is the answer to spiritual
poverty. But that is only the way of the technician, the fact-mongerer,
the information junkie, and the technological idiot. <p>

Here is what Henry David Thoreau told us: "All our inventions are but
improved means to an unimproved end." Here is what Goethe told us:
"One should, each day, try to hear a little song, read a good poem,
see a fine picture, and, if it is possible, speak a few reasonable
words." And here is what Socrates told us: "The unexamined life is not
worth living." And here is what the prophet Micah told us: "What does
the Lord require of thee but to do justly, and to love mercy and to
walk humbly with thy God?"  And I can tell you - if I had the time
(although you all know it well enough) - what Confucius, Isaiah,
Jesus, Mohammed, the Buddha, Spinoza and Shakespeare told us. It is
all the same: There is no escaping from ourselves. The human dilemma
is as it has always been, and we solve nothing fundamental by cloaking
ourselves in technological glory. <p>

Even the humblest cartoon character knows this, and I shall close by
quoting the wise old possum named Pogo, created by the cartoonist,
Walt Kelley.  I commend his words to all the technological utopians
and messiahs present. "We have met the enemy," Pogo said, "and he is
us." <p>

DIGITAL PRIVACY AND SECURITY WORKING GROUP <p>

1001 G Street, NW
Suite 950 East
Washington, DC  20001 <p>

Jerry Berman 202/347-5400
Leah Gurowitz 202/393-1010
                                                        December 6, 1993 <p>

The President
The White House
Washington, DC  20500 <p>

Dear Mr. President: <p>

On April 16, 1993, you initiated a broad industry/government review
of privacy and cryptography policies at the same time that the
Administration unveiled its Clipper Chip proposal.  The Digital Privacy and
Security Working Group -- a coalition of over 50 communications and
computer companies and associations, and consumer and privacy advocates --
has been working with members of your Administration to develop policies
which will reflect the realities of the digital information age, the need
to provide individuals at work and home with information security and
privacy, and the importance of preserving American competitiveness. <p>

The Digital Privacy and Security Working Group is committed to the
proposition that computer users worldwide should be able to choose their
encryption programs and products, and that American programs and products
should be allowed to compete in the world marketplace.  In our discussions
with Administration officials, we have expressed the Coalition's tentative
acceptance of the Clipper Chip's encryption scheme (as announced on April
16, 1993), but only if it is available as a voluntary alternative to
widely-available, commercially-accepted, encryption programs and products. <p>

Thus, we applaud repeated statements by Administration officials
that there is no intent to make the Clipper Chip mandatory.  One key
indication of whether the choice of encryption regimes will be truly
voluntary, however, is the ability of American companies to export computer
programs and products employing other strong encryption algorithms (e.g.
DES and RC2/RC4 at comparable strengths) demanded by customers worldwide.
In this regard, we commend to your attention legislation introduced by Rep.
Maria Cantwell (H.R. 3627) that would liberalize existing export controls
on software with encryption capabilities.  Of course, such legislation
would not be necessary if the Administration acts to accomplish such export
control liberalization on its own.  As part of your on-going encryption
review and decision-making, we strongly urge you to do so. <p>

As your Administration concludes its review of this issue,
representatives of the Digital Privacy and Security Working Group remain
available to meet with Administration officials at any time. <p>

Sincerely, <p>

A study of National Cryptography Policy <p>

Date: Wed, 01 Dec 93 15:34:50 EST
From: "Herb Lin" &lt;hlin@nas.edu&gt;
Subject: A study of National Cryptography Policy <p>

Please forward this message to any individual or mailing list
that you believe should receive it.  Many thanks..
*********************
As part of the Defense Authorization Bill for FY 1994, the U.S. Congress
has asked the Computer Science and Telecommunications Board
(CSTB) of the National Research Council (NRC) to undertake a study of
national policy with respect to the use and regulation of cryptography.
The report of the study committee is due two years after all necessary
security clearances have been processed, probably sometime summer
1996, and is subject to NRC review procedures.  The legislation
states that 120 days after the day on which the report is submitted to
the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary shall submit the report to the
Committees on Armed Services, Intelligence, Commerce, and the
Judiciary of the Senate and House of Representatives in unclassified
form, with classified annexes as necessary. <p>

This study is expected to address the appropriate balance in cryptography policy
among various national interests (e.g., U.S. economic competitiveness
(especially with respect to export controls), national security, law
enforcement, and the protection of the privacy rights of individuals),
and the strength of various cryptographic technologies known today
and anticipated in the future that are relevant for commercial
purposes.  The federal process through which national cryptography
policy has been formulated is also expected to be a topic of
consideration, and, if appropriate, the project will address
recommendations for improving the formulation of national
cryptographic policy in the future. <p>

This project, like other NRC projects, will depend heavily on input
from industry, academia, and other communities in the concerned
public.  Apart from the study committee (described below), briefings
and consultations from interested parties will be arranged and others
will be involved as anonymous peer reviewers. <p>

It is expected that the study committee will be a high-level group that
will command credibility and respect across the range of government,
academic, commercial, and private interests.  The committee will
include members with expertise in areas such as: <p>

- relevant computer and communications technology;
  - cryptographic technologies and cryptanalysis;
  - foreign, national security, and intelligence affairs;
  - law enforcement;
  - commercial interests; and
  - privacy and consumer interests. <p>

All committee members (and associated staff) will have to be cleared
at the "SI/TK" level; provisions have been made to expedite the
processing of security clearances for those who do not currently have
them.  Committee members will be chosen for their stature, expertise,
and seniority in their fields; their willingness to listen and consider
fairly other points of view; and their ability to contribute to the
formulation of consensus positions.  The committee as a whole will
be chosen to reflect the range of judgment and opinion on the subject
under consideration. <p>

The detailed composition of the committee has not yet been decided;
suggestions for committee members are sought from the community at
large.  Note that NRC rules regarding conflict of interest forbid the
selection as committee members of individuals that have substantial
personal financial interests that might be significantly affected by the
outcome of the study.  Please forward suggestions for people to
participate in this project to CSTB@NAS.EDU by DECEMBER 17,
1993; please include their institutional affiliations, their field(s) of
expertise, a note describing how the criteria described above apply to
them, and a way to contact them.  For our administrative
convenience, please put in the "SUBJECT:" field of your message the
words "crypto person". <p>

Finally, some people have expressed concern about the fact that the
project will involve consideration of classified material.  Arguments
can and have been made on both sides of this point, but in any event
this particular ground rule was established by the U.S. Congress, not
by the CSTB.  Whether one agrees or disagrees with the asserted
need for classification, the task at hand is to do the best possible job
given this constraint. <p>

On the National Research Council <p>

The National Research Council (NRC) is the operating arm of the
Academy complex, which includes the National Academy of Sciences,
the National Academy of Engineering, and the Institute of Medicine.
The NRC is a source of impartial and independent advice to the
federal government and other policy makers that is able to bring to
bear the best scientific and technical talent in the nation to answer
questions of national significance.  In addition, it often acts as a
neutral party in convening meetings among multiple stakeholders on
any given issue, thereby facilitating the generation of consensus on
controversial issues. <p>

The Computer Science and Telecommunications Board (CSTB) of the
NRC considers technical and policy issues pertaining to computer
science, telecommunications, and associated technologies.  CSTB
monitors the health of the computer science, computing technology,
and telecommunications fields, including attention as appropriate to
the issues of human resources and information infrastructure and
initiates studies involving computer science, computing technology,
and telecommunications as critical resources and sources of national
economic strength.  A list of CSTB publications is available on
request. <p>

A Superhighway Through the Wasteland?  NYT Op-Ed <p>

&gt;From the New York Times Op-Ed Page, Wednesday, November 24, 1993 <p>

A Superhighway Through the Wasteland?
   By Mitchell Kapor and Jerry Berman <p>

Mitchell Kapor is chairman of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a
nonprofit group that promotes civil liberties in digital media. He was a
founder of the Lotus Development Corporation, from which he resigned in
1986. Jerry Berman is executive director of the foundation. <p>

(Washington) Telecommunications and cable TV executives, seeking to
allay concerns over their proposed megamergers, insist that the coming
electronic superhighway will be an educational and informational tool as
well as a cornucopia of interactive entertainment. Allow the marriage
between entertainment and communications giants, we are told, and they will
connect students with learning resources, provide a forum for political
discourse, increase economic competitiveness and speed us into the
multimedia information age. <p>

Both broadcast and cable TV were introduced with similar fanfare. The
results have been disappointing. Because of regulatory failure and the
limits of the technology, they failed to be saviors of education or
political life. We love the tube but recognize that it is largely a
cultural wasteland. <p>

For the Government to break this cycle of promise and disappointment,
communications mergers should be approved or barred based on detailed,
enforceable commitments that the electronic superhighway will meet public
goals. The amount of electronic material the superhighway can carry is
dizzying compared to the relatively narrow range of broadcast TV and the
limited number of cable channels. Properly constructed and regulated, it
could be open to all who wish to speak, publish and communicate. <p>

None of the interactive services will be possible, however, if we have
an eight-lane data superhighway rushing into every home and only a narrow
footpath coming back out. Instead of settling for a multimedia version of
the same entertainment that is increasingly dissatisfying on today's TV, we
need a superhighway that encourages the production and distribution of a
broader, more diverse range of programming. <p>

The superhighway should be required to provide so-called open platform
services. In today's channel-based cable TV system, program producers must
negotiate for channel space with cable companies around the country. In an
open platform network, we would avoid that bottleneck. Every person would
have access to the entire superhighway, so programmers could distribute
information directly to consumers. <p>

Consumers would become producers: individuals and small organizations
could create and distribute programs to anyone on the highway who wants
them. Open platform services will spur diversity in the electronic media,
just as low production and distribution costs make possible a wide variety
of newspapers and magazines. <p>

To prevent abuses by media giants that because of recent Federal court
decisions will control the pipeline into the home and much of the content
delivered over it, we need new laws. Like today's phone companies, the
companies controlling the superhighway must be required to carry other
programmers' content, just as phone companies must provide service to
anyone who is willing to pay for it. We must guarantee that anyone who,
say, wants to start an alternative news network or a forum for political
discussion is given an outlet to do so. <p>

Americans will come to depend on the superhighway even more than they
need the telephone. The guarantee of universal telephone service must be
expanded to include universal access to the superhighway. Although market
forces will help keep the new technology affordable, we need laws to
protect consumers when competition fails. <p>

And because several companies will operate the highway, each must be
required to interconnect with the others. Likewise, the new computers that
will give us access to the superhighway should be built according to
commonly accepted standards. <p>

Also, even an open, competitive market will leave out organizations with
limited resources such as schools and libraries. To compensate for market
oversights, we must insure that money -- whether through Federal support or
a tax on the companies that will control the superhighway -- is made
available to these institutions. Finally, people won't use the new
technology unless they feel that their privacy is protected. Technical
means, such as recently developed encryption techniques, must be made
available to all users. And clear legal guidelines for individual control
over access to and reuse of personal information must be established.
Companies that sell entertainment services will have a record of what their
customers' interests are; these records must remain confidential. <p>

Bell Atlantic, T.C.I., Time-Warner, U.S. West and other companies
involved in proposed mergers have promised to allow the public full access
to the superhighway. But they are asking policy makers to trust that,
profits aside, they will use their new positions for the public good. <p>

Rather than opposing mergers or blindly trusting competition to shape
the data highways, Congress should make the mergers hinge on detailed
commitments to provide affordable services to all Americans. Some
legislators, led by Representative Ed Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts,
are working to enact similar requirements; these efforts deserve support. <p>

The best approach would be to amend these requirements to the
Communications Act of 1934. Still the central law on open access, an
updated Communications Act would codify the terms of a new social contract
between the the telecommunications industry and the American people. <p>

EFF ANNOUNCES ITS OFFICIAL POLICY ON CRYPTOGRAPHY AND PRIVACY <p>

EFF ANNOUNCES ITS OFFICIAL POLICY ON CRYPTOGRAPHY AND PRIVACY <p>

Strongly opposes original Clipper/Skipjack plan,
        reiterates the need to lift restrictions on encryption <p>

December 8, 1993 <p>

The Electronic Frontier Foundation is pleased to announce its
formal policy on encryption. <p>

This is particularly timely, because yesterday the New York Times
announced that the Digital Privacy and Security Working Group had
proposed to trade support for the administration's proposed Clipper
Chip for a lifting of the long-standing export embargo on robust
domestic encryption. <p>

This was a misunderstanding of what the DPSWG offered the
administration in this proposal, leading to the belief that both the
DPSWG (a coalition of over 50 computer, communications, and privacy
organizations and associations) and it's principal coordinating
organization, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, have offered to ease
their opposition to Clipper. <p>

We see it as a pragmatic effort to get the government to wiggle on
these issues: one step in the right direction, with many more to
follow.  This step is that we insist that use of Clipper and key
escrow must be completely voluntary.  It's not voluntary if users of
the Skipjack algorithm are forced to use key escrow.  It's not
voluntary if users who do choose escrow are forced to use the
government's choice of escrow agents.  It's not voluntary if
manufacturers such as AT&amp;T are pressured into withdrawing competing
products.  It's not voluntary when competing products can't be sold in
a worldwide market.  It's not voluntary if the public can't see the
algorithm they are "volunteering" to use.  It's not voluntary if the
government will require anyone to use Skipjack or escrow, even when
communicating with the government. <p>

The Working Group chose to state this in a diplomatic fashion by
applauding "repeated statements by Administration officials that there
is no intent to make the clipper chip mandatory".  They were diplomatic
for two reasons.  First, they believe the Administration has gotten this
message.  Clipper was announced in April and was supposed to be
available in the Summer.  It is December, the escrow system is still
uncertain, and the Administration is still drafting a report which was
due in July.  If they still don't get it, the coalition has a 100 page
white paper documenting the case against clipper and the case for
lifting export controls, which they will release in response to any
Administration position favoring Clipper. <p>

The second reason is that the coalition was trying to use the
introduction of the Rep. Cantwell's bill eliminating many export
controls on crypto to try, one more time, to urge the Administration
to make voluntariness meaningful by unilaterally lifting export
controls.  Even if the Working Group and the Administration can't
agree on Clipper, EFF and the Working Group needed to continue
pressing the export issue. <p>

But NSA is digging in, and a legislative fight looks more likely.
If diplomacy fails, EFF must fight for our rights.  Thus, we are
going to need all the allies we can find, from IBM, Apple, Lotus,
and Sun, to cryptographers, cypherpunks, and folks on the net. <p>

EFF wants the public and the Administration to know (as we have
frequently stated to them face to face) that the Electronic Frontier
Foundation would fight to the end any attempt by the Administration to
do any more than let companies use it if they want and to let people
buy it if they want -- and only in a market which has other strong
encryption schemes available because export controls have been lifted. <p>

Under truly voluntary conditions, the EFF would be proud to say, "We
have expressed ... tentative acceptance of the Clipper Chip's
encryption scheme ... only if it is available as a voluntary
alternative to widely-available, commercially-accepted encryption
programs and products."  We would applaud the Government for employing
NSA's substantial expertise to devise improved encryption schemes --
like DES and Skipjack -- and deploying them to improve our society's
privacy and security. <p>

We hope that the Clinton Administration can agree to take this single
step.  Here is the whole journey we'd like to begin.  If you share our
path, we need your help and support -- please join EFF.  Send email to
eff@eff.org for details. <p>

Electronic Frontier Foundation Policy on Cryptography &amp; Privacy
        (Approved November 11, 1993) <p>

Digital technology is rapidly rendering our commercial activities and
communications -- indeed, much of our personal lives -- open to scrutiny by
strangers. Our medical records, political opinions, personal financial
transactions, and intimate affairs now pass over digital networks where
governments, employers, insurance companies, business competitors, and
others who might turn our private lives against us can examine them with
increasing ease and detail. <p>

The Electronic Frontier Foundation believes that Americans must be allowed
access to the cryptographic tools necessary to protect their own privacy.
We will work toward making the following principles the official policies
of the U. S. Government: <p>

1.      Private access to cryptography must be unhindered: <p>

*    There must be no laws restricting domestic use of cryptography. <p>

*    There must be no restrictions on the export of products, services,
or information because they contain cryptographic algorithms. <p>

2.      Cryptography policy and technical standards must be set in open,
public forums: <p>

*    All participants in the policy debate on these issues, particularly
law enforcement and national security agencies, must submit their arguments
to public scrutiny. <p>

*    Any civilian encryption standard must be published and exposed to
rigorous public challenge. <p>

3.      Encryption must become a part of the information infrastructure to
provide security, to protect privacy, and to provide each individual
control over his or her own identity. <p>

*    Each user must be free to choose whether or not to use key escrow,
and who should have copies of their keys, if anyone. <p>

*    Government at all levels should explore cryptography's potential to
replace identity-based or dossier-based systems, such as driver's licenses,
credit cards, checks, and passports with less invasive technology. <p>

4.      New technologies must not erode constitutional protections,
particularly the right to speak, publish, and assemble, and to be free from
unreasonable searches and seizures . <p>

*    There must be no broadening of governmental access to private
communications and records, through wiretap law or otherwise, unless there
is a public consensus that the risks to safety outweigh the risks to
liberty and that our safety will actually be increased by the broadened
access. <p>

*** <p>

The Electronic Frontier Foundation recognizes that the combination of
digital communications and encryption technology does indeed threaten
some of law enforcement's current investigative techniques. <p>

We also recognize that encryption will prevent many of the online
crimes that will likely occur without it.  We further believe that
these technologies will create new investigative tools for law
enforcement, even as they obsolete old ones.  Entering this new
environment, private industry, law enforcement, and private citizens
must work together to balance the requirements of both liberty and
security.  But technology halts for no one, not even the law. <p>

A note on the politics of privacy and infrastructure <p>

Date: Sat, 20 Nov 1993 11:46:50 -0500
From: mkapor@kei.com (Mitchell Kapor) <p>

Rich Karlgaard &lt;0005096930@mcimail.com&gt; wisely observes: <p>

&gt;       ...the range of
&gt;political opinion in the U.S. is not always spread
&gt;along a single axis of left to right. I believe
&gt;there is another axis ascendant. It is
&gt;authoritarian/libertarian.
&gt;       Try this exercise. Draw a left-to-right
&gt;line across a page. Then draw a vertical line from
&gt;top to bottom, labeling it Authoritarian on top,
&gt;Libertarian on bottom. You have just created a
&gt;grid with four quadrants. <p>

I have tried to illustrate his point.  My deficiencies as a graphic artist
are equaled only by the impoverished of ASCII as a graphical medium. <p>

Karlgaard's two axes: <p>

-----------authoritarian------------
     |               ^                  |
     |               |                  |
     |&lt;----left------|------ right----&gt; |
     |               |                  |
     |               v                  |
     -----------libertarian-------------- <p>

I want to substitute "anti-authoritarian" for "libertarian", as follows: <p>

----------- authoritarian----------
     |               ^                  |
     |               |                  |
     |&lt;----left------|------ right----&gt; |
     |               |                  |
     |               v                  |
     -----------anti-authoritarian------- <p>

Doing this permits distinguishing two varieties of anti-authoritarian, the
decentralist and the libertarian. <p>

--------------------------------------
    |                 |                   |
    |                 |                   |
    |-------------------------------------|
    |  decentralist   |  libertarian      |
    |                 |                   |
    --------------------------------------- <p>

In my terminology Libertarian  is used to refer more specifically to the
right quadrant of the anti-authoritarian position.  The left side of the
anti-authoritarian space I have chosen to call decentralist. <p>

As Rich indicates, on some issues, like NAFTA and, I might add, the Clipper
Chip, the opposing sides are divided, not on liberal-conservative political
lines, but on the horizontal axis. <p>

I would claim that the lower half of the political space simply be called
anti-authoritarian and that it is divided into two quadrants: on the left,
the decentralist, and on the right, the libertarian. <p>

You can see how this works on Clipper chip and other privacy issues related
to encryption.  EFF chairs a coalition of 60 organizations, from the
American Petroleum Institute to the ACLU, which opposes government control
of encryption.  You have cypherpunks and corporate interests aligned on
this issue, because they all want decentralization of control over
encryption technology. <p>

On issues where the goal is to remove government-imposed barriers, like
privacy,  there is easy agreement between left-leaning decentralists and
right-leaning libertarians.  The coherence of EFF's Board resides in the
libertarian-decentralist commonality of interest which is more important
than conventional divisions of left-right politics. <p>

On the other hand, the sometimes fractious nature of the public interest
community, of which EFF is part, can be seen to in splits along the same
horizontal axis. EFF supports private sector ownership and operation of the
National Information Infrastructure,, Many other public interest
organizations share the same general goals of openness for the NII as EFF
but prefer approaches lying above the horizontal midline, e.g., through
direct government ownership or operation of the NII. <p>

Infrastructure is a trickier issue than privacy. All anti-authoritarians
would agree that a government-built NII is the wrong approach.  However,
there seems to be more willingness among many on the net who think of
themselves as libertarians to leave it entirely to private industry to
build the NII, where government abandons any role, even as referee.   If we
wound up with an NII controlled by an oligopoly of enormous corporate
interests which resulted in centralized control over content, it would be a
bad thing.  If independent content providers can't easily get on the
network, it would be a huge catastrophe. <p>

It seems to me that, in principle, corporate authoritarianism is as
dangerous as government authoritarianism, and this is an issue which may
separate left-quadrant and right-quadrant anti-authoritarians. <p>

A libertarian would argue that if government got out of the way, e.g.,
deregulated telecommunications and let everybody compete, it would be
sufficient to achieve the right kind of NII.  Personally, I think that's
naive.  A more considered libertarian view would be that either the market
will produce the desired result by itself OR IT WON'T, but there is nothing
anybody can do to alter the outcome.  Thus government should stay out of
it, and the public interest community should go home.  To me, this is both
fatalistic and simplistic. <p>

A decentralist would say that deregulation alone is not necessarily going
to be sufficient to produce a decentralized NII.  It might be and it might
not.  But if it is not, we do not need to be fatalists about it.  We have
the opportunity to try to influence the outcome both by working at the
level of raising consciousness and through the possibility legislation
which ratifies some sort of hard-fought compromise that achieves certain
goals (e.g. for new common carriage or new universal service).  This
embodies the EFF approach. <p>

We may all get lucky in the sense that the architecture of consumer
broadband networks winds up following a model which is more, rather than
less, like the Internet in its openness and decentralization.  This appears
to be the general direction Bell Atlantic is taking.  However, while their
system is open (in terms of common carriage or system architecture), it is
heavily asymmetrical with a big downstream pipe and a small upstream pipe,
at least for the foreseeable future. <p>

If the TCI merger goes through, and if they are able to rationalize two
different networks, business models, and corporate cultures, what obtains
for BA will hold for  TCI too.  There are some mighty big ifs here, and in
any event Bell Atlantic/TCI only serves 25% of the country.  Other
carriers, who have a different business model which does not emphasize
revenue from transport a la Bell Atlantic, but revenue from content, may
choose to go with closed, channelized systems. <p>

We have to see what other cable companies and telcos actually offer.
Increasingly I am going to focus my efforts on understanding the likely
architectural deployments of the carriers and how close they come to EFF's
model of an open platform.  The pragmatic question which faces us as we
fill in the picture with details will be what, if anything, can be done, to
nudge the system into providing alternatives which are closer to open
platforms. <p>

All in all, I'd prefer to try to catalyze any necessary changes in mindset
of carriers in order to secure voluntary moves.  But as a pragmatist I
believe that government action, or certainly the threat of it, may be
useful or, in the worst case, necessary, to achieve the desired end.
Further, since the whole process is already highly politicized, I think
involvement to prevent bad governmental solutions from being imposed and
screwing things up is clearly necessary.  Thus politics is inevitably
involved to carry out a an anti-authoritarian mission.  At least in my
view. <p>

FBI'S DIGITAL TELEPHONY BILL WAS RESULT OF FAILED 2-YEAR BEHIND-SCENES	 CAMPAIGN--submited with permission of author <p>

COMMUNICATIONS DAILY

FBI'S DIGITAL TELEPHONY BILL WAS RESULT OF FAILED 2-YEAR BEHIND-SCENES
CAMPAIGN
by Brock N. Meeks <p>

FBI's controversial Digital Wiretap Bill was result of failed
2-year campaign, code-named "Operation Root Canal," to win quiet
telephone industry agreement to give law enforcement agencies
easy wiretap access to digital conversations, Communications
Daily has learned. <p>

Previously classified documents show how bill was introduced
in light of industry's insistence that no voluntary agreement
could ensure compliance by all of industry. Telephone companies
ultimately opposed bill, confounding FBI, which thought it had
full industry endorsement.  Industry figures have denied publicly
that they encouraged FBI to introduce bill. Documents also raise
serious doubts about legitimacy of FBI's frequent claim that
digital technologies are proved stumbling blocks to criminal
investigations. <p>

Month-long examination by Communications Daily that included
interviews with telephone company and law enforcement officials and
inspection of more than 180 pages of documents obtained from FBI
and Justice Dept. under Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), supplied
to us by Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility (CPSR),
also revealed that Bureau:  (1) Tried to get industry voluntarily
to write digital wiretap "trapdoors" into future specifications for
central office switches.  (2) Attempted to convince industry to
cooperate voluntarily by indicating that FBI wouldn't be able to
protect network security.  (3) Developed study of financial impact
of digital wiretap access on industry, later claiming no such study
existed. <p>

In absence of law compelling industry to comply with FBI
desire for digital wiretap access, Bureau tried to induce telephone
companies to develop "immediate and interim solutions" to problem,
according to internal FBI memo dated Feb. 8, 1991.  Memo also said
FBI agents, in conversations with industry executives, "stressed
the necessity to incorporate these monitoring requirements in
future specifications for central office switches." <p>

When FBI began to realize industry wouldn't go along
voluntarily with its request for digital access, it painted dire
picture of how Bureau would be limited in ability to fight crime
if wiretap access weren't given, pointedly claiming that security
of networks themselves would be at risk. <p>

Industry reluctance to comply voluntarily with FBI plan meant
agency had to turn to legislation.  "It was the Bureau's court of
last resort," FBI source said.  Internal FBI memo dated Aug. 21,
1991, quoted unidentified PacBell official as saying:  "The only
viable solution for this problem would be through legislative
action as technical solutions alone would be cost prohibitive and
ineffective."  PacBell official also is quoted saying legislation
"would ensure the equal commitment of all providers." <p>

Telephone company officials have denied publicly that they
supported legislative solution.  When existence of bill was made
public, RHCs and equipment makers opposed it, confusing FBI.  In
Sept. 22, 1992, letter to Charles Bowsher, then Comptroller Gen.,
then-FBI Dir. William Sessions said that when Bureau efforts to
gain industry's voluntary compliance failed "to achieve prompt
action," industry reached consensus that "legislative mandate was
both needed and desired -- a stance later repudiated by industry
spokespersons."  In fact, industry lobbying against bill became so
intense that then-Attorney Gen. William Barr, in June 1992 letter
to Sessions, told how he had sought to enlist efforts of
then-Commerce Secy. Barbara Franklin because her "support is
urgently needed to help diminish the telecommunications industry's
intense lobbying efforts in opposition." <p>

Whether companies flip-flopped on legislative issue is
unclear.  FBI refused to comment on apparent conflict between
consensus Sessions thought he had from industry and industry's
vehement opposition to bill when it was introduced:  "You'll have
to get those answers from the industry," said agent Barry Smith of
FBI Legislative Affairs Office. <p>

Although FBI documents clearly show industry agreed
legislation was only way FBI could hope to gain industrywide
compliance, it isn't clear that industry gave any indication it
would support such a bill if introduced.  Interviews with industry
officials produced contradictory accounts.  One senior RHC official
who took part in FBI-industry meetings said flip-flop was
"calculated game of political brinksmanship."  He said industry
never had any intention of backing legislation:  "This was all an
elaborate kind of shell game to discourage the FBI from making us
spend millions of dollars to make their job easier." <p>

But another RHC official differed:  "I don't recall the
industry ever telling the FBI it would support legislation.
Certainly our company never indicated that position."  AT&amp;T
spokesman said company has "always been opposed to legislative
solution."  Yet, when idea of legislation was presented to
representatives of AT&amp;T, Bell Labs and Nynex at Aug. 21, 1991,
meeting with FBI, as recorded in Sept. 30, 1991, internal FBI memo,
none of those present was noted as opposing legislative idea.
Indeed, almost year later, perceived industry flip-flop still
bothered Bureau.  Internal FBI memo dated Sept. 30, 1992 (after
industry had come out against bill), written by Kier Boyd, FBI
Deputy Asst. Dir. Operations-Technical Services Div., said "the
RBOCs are playing both sides of the street, so as not to offend the
Justice Dept., which enjoys considerable power over their
activities" under MFJ.  However, if that was intention, result was
an FBI obviously irked by what it saw as duplicity. <p>

FBI Worries Groundless? <p>

Despite FBI insistence that digital technologies have
potential to thwart investigations, Bureau has no evidence to
support claim, documents revealed.  Bureau has said publicly that
investigations already have been hampered by current digital
technologies, but has declined to respond to requests for
specifics.  However, FBI field report documents show Bureau
received no support from field officers to back up claims of
problems caused by digital technologies;  field offices repeatedly
reported no difficulty in carrying out electronic surveillance.
Dec. 3, 1992, report from Newark office is typical, as it reported:
(1) Drug Enforcement Administration "advised that as of this date,
the DEA has not had any technical problems with advanced telephone
technology."  (2) N.J. Attorney Gen.'s office said it hasn't had
any problems "since the last contact."  (3) IRS reported no
problems with "advanced telephone matters."  (4) N.J. State Police
said that "as of this date" agency has had no problems with
technology's hindering investigations. <p>

Examination of all documents released turned up no reports
of technology's hampering investigations.  In Nov. 16 appearance
on Wis. Public Radio, Special Agent James Kallstrom of FBI
Technical Services Div. also contradicted previous FBI claims,
admitting during debate with CPSR legal counsel David Sobel that
digital technologies hadn't yet hampered FBI investigations. <p>

Major concern of Congress, consumer advocates and industry is
eventual cost of implementing FBI plan.  Agency consistently has
said it's in no position to evaluate such costs.  When GAO
investigators asked FBI for any cost analysis agency had done, FBI
denied it had any.  But in May 26, 1992, memo from Attorney Gen.
Barr to FBI Dir. Sessions titled "Digital Telephony Information
Memorandum," which outlines changes Justice Dept. made in FBI's
original bill, Barr said "significant" change in measure "is that
it is silent on how the cost burden for accommodating law
enforcement's needs will be assumed."  Same memo then said efforts
to "compress the timetable" for presenting legislation included "a
cost-benefits study formulated by the FBI [that] was forwarded
through your staff to the OMB."  FBI declined to release study. <p>

Background on Information Superhighway 1993-12-20 PART 1 of 2 <p>

THE WHITE HOUSE <p>

Office of the Press Secretary
______________________________________________________________ <p>

BACKGROUND BRIEFING
                                  BY
                   SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS <p>

December 20, 1993 <p>

The Briefing Room <p>

3:17 P.M. EST <p>

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Good afternoon.  Vice
President Gore will deliver the luncheon address tomorrow afternoon
at the National Press Club to do one of two major speeches that he
will present on telecommunications policy and reform that the
administration will be pursuing in 1994 with both legislative and
administrative actions. <p>

In between the Vice President's speeches, Secretary Ron
Brown will deliver a speech also in early January regarding the
implications of telecommunications reform for the economy.  The
second speech the Vice President will deliver will be in California,
in Los Angeles, on January 11th at an all-day summit hosted by the
Television Academy of Arts and Sciences on the superhighway --
information superhighway.  I believe they put out a press release
about 10 days ago on that and are finalizing the agenda and the
participants.  But that will have representatives from all of the
information industry -- cable, television, telephone, movies, energy
industry, education community -- at which point the Vice President
will lay out the blueprint for the administration's proposed reform
of both those aspects of the Telecommunications Act of 1934 and the
modified final judgment from the AT&amp;T divestiture judicial
restrictions on communications industry in the January speech,
followed by legislation at the beginning of the next session. <p>

Tomorrow afternoon, the Vice President will lay out
several principles that he thinks should guide the administration and
the Congress's reform of the telecommunications laws and the creation
of the marketplace of the future in information.  As part of that he
will also discuss some of the processes that we have been going
through in the administration both interagency and between the White
House and the Congress to communicate with and respond to the many
bills that have been introduced on the Hill regarding
telecommunications reform. <p>

With the confirmation of Reed Hundt now as the Chairman
of the FCC and the team in place at the Department of Commerce and
the Department of Justice, there are all the people in place to take
responsibilities for different aspects of the decisions that would
have to be made for a transition from the Telecommunications Act of
'34 and the system that both legislative and administrative changes
would set up. <p>

Let me introduce my colleague in just a moment to talk
about some of the process we've through as well as the implications. <p>

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  What I thought I'd do
is just give you a sense of what's the desired end point, what is the
nature of the phase we're in now, and what's the nature of -- what
are in broad terms the kinds of issues that we have to deal with. <p>

And I'll stay with the sort of -- the most fundamental information
industry kinds of questions. <p>

What the changes in technology to which the Vice
President's speeches and Secretary Brown's speeches will basically be
responsive to really mean is that for the first time since we've had
a telecommunications -- since telecommunications has been a central
part of the economy is that -- is the possibility for absolutely
pervasive competition in every single line of business of
telecommunications.  And therefore the desired end point is to move
to -- is to move to a point ultimately where any company can offer
any services through any network to any set of consumers.  That's the
desired end you'd like to reach to, and where all of the facets of
the industry are competitive. <p>

Obviously, the period that we're in at the moment is a
period -- and it'll probably be a long period -- of transition
between a telecommunications and an information environment that was
characterized really quite differently, when technologies were very
different and when there were lines of business, when particular
technologies offered particular lines of business and there was
really no merging between the two.  And the best way, I think, to
think of the issues that are going to be on the Hill next year and to
which the Vice President and Secretary Brown will be referring and
responding in the course of their speeches is the following:  There
are a whole set of problems which derive from what are the kinds of
services that a company can offer.  Can it offer local competitive
services -- i.e., in the local loop where telecommunications go to
the home?  Can a company offer long distance services?  Can a company
engage in manufacturing?  Can a company engage in what are called
"information services," which is the offer to the home or to a
business of particular information. <p>

So one area in which legislation is being considered and
upon which the Vice President will comment will be the loosening of
restrictions which affect what services a company can offer. <p>

Another whole area derives from the fact that because of
the history of telecommunications and the different history of
companies, companies with different kinds of history now offer
different kinds of services and are restricted in that way.  So a
cable company offers one kind of services, broadcast television
offers another kind, now convergent mostly with cable television,
telephone companies offer another kind.  And, again, another set of
legislation is increasingly -- moves in the direction of saying that
the past history matters less and less, and as long as there is
competition, companies can -- irrespective of their past history --
can offer competing services.  Both are responding to the basic fact
that the technology has changed fundamentally and that all of these
things are now convergent. <p>

The end result of all of that I stated in one way, which
is -- is the capability to offer any set of services to any consumer
through any network at any time.  Another way, though, of thinking
about that is the enormous changes and advantages as we begin -- as
that begins to be put in place nationally for our economy.  Not only
is it in itself -- do those changes involve an enormous amount of
investment, and therefore jobs, but they also increase radically the
flexibility of our economy, its capability to deal with change, the
capability to offer new and different services, the capability of
companies to work with each other so that you can see a merging out
of the information infrastructure an economy that functions in quite
significantly different ways.  And that's the end result, is a much
freer, much more competitive telecommunications and information
marketplace that, because it is that way, changes in quite
fundamental ways the nature of the economy. <p>

My colleague and I are available for questions if there
are any. <p>

Q    How does this affect the average person?  Is this
-- it sounds wonderful, but I'm not sure how it affects them and when
it will affect them. <p>

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think that the first
way it affects them is going to be lower prices for
telecommunications and information services.  I think that the second
way that it will affect them will be the increased investment, the
increased number of jobs that the information industry change means.
The third way it's going to affect them is it's going to change the
very nature of their work.  I mean, just as an example, video
conferencing is on an almost vertical rise up within companies as the
price has come down.  You're going to see much more of that.  You're
going to see a very large number of people working in companies who
can now spend more of their time at home as telecommuting replaces
vehicle commuting. <p>

Now, timelines for those -- the first couple of changes
that I announced -- that I mentioned -- price changes, investment
changes, probably over the next very few years.  The longer changes
of lifestyle -- end of the century, seven years, eight years. <p>

Q    Would this be happening without what you're doing?
Because I've heard about this for quite a while.  What is the White
House doing with this legislation that wouldn't happen otherwise? <p>

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Regulation -- let me
make one point about laws and regulations and my colleague can make
another.  The technology that changes that are occurring are going to
change and the changes are going to occur irrespective of what
anybody does.  And to suggest that they wouldn't is a little bit like
pretending you're King Knute.  Technology has historically shown a
tendency to move much more rapidly than regulation.  And what this
does is catch regulation up with where technology is and give it --
and provide a capacity so it can change much more flexibly. <p>

Q    Except that how do you define competition?  This is
a tough thing to get your arms around because nobody knows yet where
the market's going or what the mergers are going to end up being. <p>

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  That's right. <p>

Q    So you must have, in whatever proposals you have
that you're sending to the Hill some kind of definitions for what you
would consider competition.  Is it two companies, side by side?  Must
it be three?  And then, before you get to that competition, you must
also be thinking of some kind of regulations that protect the people
from a monopoly developing. <p>

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Let me make one point
on this, and then my colleague should speak.  My colleague made the
point that no one can predict the shape and appearance of markets
that are changing this rapidly and their shape and appearance in the
future.  But what we can do is try to build certain values into the
system.  And one of those values has got to be a competitive
environment and a competitive marketplace. <p>

And, therefore, what the regulatory system has to do as
it ushers us through a transition like this, is provide for checks
along the way so that one can ask the question, is there, in fact,
competition. <p>

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  And we're not saying
that these models will be developed overnight or even be clear and
accepted by everybody when the proposals are introduced by the <p>

administration in January and early February.  But already, on the
Hill, you see people who are providing models that, as in the
Dingell-Brooks bill, that for certain changes in the law, there have
to be reviews by the Justice Department and the FCC in their areas of
jurisdiction and in antitrust considerations regarding what is
competition. <p>

Now, the challenge is that the Telecommunications Act of
'34 dealt with a much different world.  We have now had the challenge
of coming up with models that define competition in the modern world
where you don't have competition that's based just on how many wires
go into your house, but what your access is to wireless technology.
The fact that we're going to be talking to our televisions and
watching our telephones means that we have to redefine what
competition means because we're going to be getting information from
every source imaginable.  And as one person put it, everything we do
now through wires in the ground we're going to do in the air; and
everything we do now in the air we're going to do through wires in
the ground.  So we have to rethink the models at the same time that
we're rethinking the technology. <p>

If I could go back quickly to the question about what
does this mean for the average American and how soon will it mean it,
we're already seeing a situation in which education is reversed in
the home.  Parents are learning computers from their children.
Parents are learning how to program their VCRs and their cell phones
from their children.  The technology revolution is occurring more
quickly than the education system can handle it or the regulatory
system.  And as a result, all of these changes that we read about
everyday in the paper are occurring -- they're running into the wall
of regulations and judicial restrictions, and they're all finding
little fish ladders around the dam so to speak.  We're got to start
dealing with how to open up the dam in a controlled way to let these
technologies flow in a way that still protects universal service,
competition, open access and privacy. <p>

Q    You talked about removing barriers between various
industries.  And right now the FCC licenses services for very
specific -- gives licenses for the airwaves for very specific
purposes like broadcast tv or cellular phones.  Could you ever
foresee, say, a television station being allowed to use maybe a
portion of its spectrum for another kind of service or cellular phone
system  -- using it for some other thing? <p>

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I could foresee it.  I
don't think that's something that we're going to have to deal with in
this initial proposal that deals with the legislative angle.  But let <p>

me say, if you look at the companies who are now making a living by
gathering taxi cab radio frequencies and bundling them together for
cell networks.  There's a great opportunity here to convert one form
of use of the frequency into another form that has a much better
economic potential. <p>

Q    One of the reasons the local phone companies have
been kept out of long distance, and it's obvious they're a monopoly,
how much of their monopoly do they have to lose in order for them to
be allowed into this new area?  I mean, is it 90, 80, 70, 60? <p>

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  That's the same
question we got just a second ago.  The Justice Department will have
to be setting up those kinds of models.  The important thing is, are
we going to start the process of addressing that question and dealing
with proposals like Ameritech's and others who have said, we'll let
you into our area if you'll let us into yours.  And we have to
decide, what do we mean by effective competition before we let the
regional companies into other areas and prevent monopolies. <p>

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Let me give you another
perspective on your point.  I said that we're in a period of
transition that'll last a decade or more.  After all, the
Communications Act of '34 is now 50 years old -- 60 years old.  And
we're not in the legislation that will be considered this next year,
going to get to the point that you've stated.  But very, very
respectable people in the business and in the academic fields that
look at it, say that we're getting to the point where you really
ought to think of these different kinds of companies as bit companies
-- they're as bits companies.  And some of them sell them by over-
the-air broadcast, and some of them sell them by other kinds of
wireless technologies, and some of them sell them through wires under
the ground.  And that, ultimately, the point is that they're all
going to be selling bits, and they ought to all be regulated in a way
that recognizes it in certain fundamental ways that are in the same
business. <p>

Q    Is that going to affect newspapers having
restrictions on TV stations they can own and vice-versa, in the same
market -- <p>

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Not the current
legislation.  The current legislation does not, and largely, I think,
because the system can only accommodate so much at any given time.
We really are in a period of transition.  But if you follow the logic
of what I just said, yes, ultimately. <p>

Remember, the fundamental switch that is occurring here
is from scarcity to plenty; that the reason why most of the
regulation has been in effect for so long is the basic underlying
assumption that the ways to the consumer were limited; and therefore
control over them was antithetical, both to the nature to our economy
and also to a democracy. <p>

If you've reached a point where spectrum space, because
of the many different ways of using over the air and also
fiberoptics, coaxial cable is essentially unlimited, then you begin
to reach a point where you care less about the nature of regulation
as it is now and you begin to look for a change. <p>

Q    Are there some companies -- I'm not an expert in
this -- but are there some companies like an AT&amp;T or whatever that
are not going to care for this kind of change that you're talking
about? <p>

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  The devil's in the
details -- if you went around to the industry and you said do you
subscribe to the -- any company through any network, any information
service to any set of consumers, everyone would agree.  It's in the
answering of the specific questions, like how do you judge
competition, what particular rules do you have in effect where people
are going to -- out. <p>

Q    Well, on that note, what specific provisions in
bills on the Hill do you like?  And could you talk about what you're
looking at as far as some of the subsidiary guidelines, pricing
things -- what do you see up there that you like, and what might the
Vice President be endorsing? <p>

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, first of all, all
of the bills that are currently introduced on the Hill are a step in
the right direction.  They tend to compliment each other -- there's
some overlap.  There's very little contradiction.  You'd have to get
into the details to see some areas where there would be some real
disagreements. <p>

In his speech tomorrow, the Vice President -- well,
first off, the Vice President has spoken with the spoken with the <p>

sponsors of all of the bills that are on the Hill in the last month
or two and has met with many of them personally, and has had an
interagency group that has been reviewing all of that.  Tomorrow in
his talk he will address where he would like to go with some of those
bills, although the administration proposal and which of the bills we
will incorporate and which provisions will be announced in the
January speech in Los Angeles. <p>

Q    That hasn't been decided yet then? <p>

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Some of the basic
principles -- let me put it this way -- the basic principle that we
are going to change our regulatory system to allow for -- to decrease
the restrictions on the cable companies, the telephone companies, the
information services provided by telephones and to provide for easing
of the MFJ, modified final judgment restrictions.  That decision is
clearly made.  The details of the architecture of how you do that and
the timetable under which you do that and the tests, both entry and
post-entry that you use to guard that, is still under discussion. <p>

Q    To what extent are you worried that deregulation
might have the same effect on the telecommunications industry that it
did on the airline industry or the breakup of the phone companies? <p>

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, first off, we're
not talking about instant deregulation; we're talking about a
transition period from a system that is well-known but not well-
working and a system that is not yet in place which we think will
provide much better market measures -- or market incentives for
competition and for in investment.  The difficult time is the
transition. <p>

And in that transition, you will still need to have
government regulation; you will always need to have anti-trust review
of the market as it exists to prevent monopoly advantage.  So, we are
not talking about a black or white situation.  We are talking about
walking a line between the current antiquated system and a system in
which market principles would apply except in those areas where
either geography or economic benefits create a monopoly that we find
unacceptable based on the values that the Vice President is going to
talk about tomorrow. <p>

Q    When you talk about easing the MFJ, are you talking
about letting the regional phone companies get into long distance --
because you know the fights that exist between the long distance
companies and the regional phone companies about crossing into each
other's territory?  So, are you just going to -- are you going to
open that up and say let's get rid of the MFJ, or are you talking
about contingent on something else you can get rid of this part of
the MFJ? <p>

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, remember we're
not operating in a vacuum.  The Dingell-Brooks bill lays out, for
instance, a timetable for the regional companies to get in on the
long distance going through certain entry barriers and Department of
Justice and FCC reviews.  We are -- we think that that provides a
very good model.  We are looking at how that could be incorporated.
We have some issues that we still need to understand about the bill. <p>

But we're not talking about just taking two opposing
groups and throwing them in the same room together.  We're talking
about coming up with rules of the road when we get to this
intersection.  And even today, AT&amp;T said that although they had been
skeptical, historically, of this kind of relaxation, they now see
some good things about it.  So we think there's a way to work this
out. <p>

Q    To borrow a phrase from health care, is this sort
of like "managed deregulation"?  Is that what you're talking about? <p>

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, any kind of
deregulation is going to be managed.  And somehow I don't think that
I -- it's a nice term, but I don't think it's a appropriate analogy.
We face next year -- have the opportunity of seeing next year the
largest single change in telecommunications regulation and law that's
occurred since 1934.  And the changes are really absolutely
substantial. <p>

There is, I think, with respect to the kinds of values
that my colleague underlined, which is to say, privacy, competition,
access, there is a responsibility to make certain that certain kinds
of values get built into the system.  But if by "managed," you mean,
do we think that we have some sense that we can make this a careful,
stately kind of transition irrespective of the way the technology is
flowing, no.  Technology is occurring extremely rapidly, and
government doesn't affect that rate of change much. <p>

Q    Would the administration's bill include some
provision on these mergers -- like, for instance, TCI-Bell Atlantic
-- AT&amp;T?  Did you all address those issues -- <p>

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No.  The
administration's bill -- when those mergers were announced, the White
House statement on those was that we favor competition, we favor
improved opportunities for information provision to all sectors of
society, and that there are formal reviews going on on all of those
mergers, and we let those processes run.  We are not going to try and
pick and choose among all the mergers in the legislation. <p>

We are trying to, in the proposals we will put forward
-- and the Vice President speaks tomorrow -- talk about the market
that's out there, how the market is changing, and how the technology
improves communication.  This isn't so much about technology,
although that's what we read about every day, as it is about
technology's effects on the way we communicate and the way we're
going to communicate, and who will have information and who will not.
And the provision of information to the public, to schools,
hospitals, libraries, as well as to the economically well-off sectors
of society is a crucial point that we want to make sure is included
in any reforms that happen. <p>

Q    Well, you mean, he won't outline what his plan is;
he'll just do an overview of -- <p>

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  He will do an overview
of some of the questions we're going to address as well as the
principles he thinks need to be incorporated in the blueprint, as
well as principles that we anticipate, or that we would like to see
in the marketplace that the private sector creates as well, because
there are many responsibilities we think the private sector should
take on that relate to the values of universal service and open
access, some of which are governed by anti-trust principles, others
are governed by the value we put on information's importance to any
democracy. <p>

Q    I missed who the Vice President is going to talk to
tomorrow. <p>

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  The National Press
Club. <p>

Q    What the difference between the January 4th and the
January 11th speech? <p>

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Ron Brown will do the
January 4th speech, primarily on the economic aspects of the -- <p>

Q    And what -- the January 11th speech is going to be
about? <p>

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Is the Vice President's
blueprint in Los Angeles. <p>

Q       public institution, so is there going to be a
universal access for poor people so they can get phones, and are they
considering television and cable television now, something that that
should also be available no matter how -- <p>

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  The extent of how we
define universal service is actively under discussion.  And the
question of subsidies or rate subsidies is also a very difficult one.
As you know, the definition of universal service has gone to having a
party line phone to having an individual line.  Is call-waiting part
of universal service?  Is a modem hook-up part of universal service?
Those are some of the questions that we have to answer.  We don't
expect to have all of the answers, because the market will surprise
us down the road in terms of what's available. <p>

One of the issues we want to propose to deal with that
question is how to make the regulatory system more responsive more
quickly to technology changes.  We can't wait 60 years at a pop to
catch up with technology.  So that's one of the problems we're going
to reach is, how can we make the regulatory system more responsive to
the technological opportunities. <p>

THE PRESS:  Thank you. <p>

38 Hours in Hamburg: A visit to the 10th Chaos Communications Congress <p>

38 Hours in Hamburg:
A visit to the 10th Chaos Communications Congress <p>

by Manny E. Farber <p>

Armed only with an invitation in English addressed to the "global
community" and a small pile of German Marks, I arrived at the
Eidelstedter Buergerhaus about an hour or so before the beginning of
the 10th Chaos Communication Congress (subtitled "Ten years after
Orwell"), sponsored by the (in)famous Chaos Computer Club.  The
Buergerhaus (literally, "citizen's house") turned out to be a modest
community hall; needless to say, not all invited showed up.  The
Congress took place between the 27th and the 29th of December.  As the
title implies, social as well as technical issues were on the docket. <p>

After forking over 30 DM (about $20) for a pass for the first two
days of the Congress, I sort of felt like asking for a schedule, but
refrained, thinking that asking for scheduled chaos might seem a bit
odd.  I went to the cafeteria for breakfast.  An organizer started out
announcing, "Anyone who wants to eat breakfast pays 5 Marks, and gets a
stamp, which--no, rather, anyone who wants breakfast pays 5 Marks and
eats breakfast." <p>

The atmosphere was quite collegial and informal, with little more
order than was absolutely necessary.  The approximately 150 attendees
were predominantly German (a few from Switzerland and Holland, at least
-- and probably only -- one from the United States, namely myself),
male, and technically oriented.  (During an explanation of the
mathematical algorithm underlying electronic cash, a non-techie
objected, "But I don't want to have to think up a 200-digit random
number every time I buy something!"  It was explained to him that this
was done by software in the chip-card ...). <p>

Although not mentioned in the invitation, not a word of English was to
be heard; all the events were conducted in German.  Some were conducted
in a "talk show" format, with a host asking questions, simplifying
answers, making jokes.  A television network carried the video from the
auditorium to other rooms throughout the building (albeit without
sound) along with up-to-the-minute event schedules. <p>

The tone of the discussions of how electronic cash could be
embezzled, or chip cards abused, digital signatures forged, etc., was
constructive rather than destructive.  And it was balanced, i.e. not
only "how could a malicious individual embezzle money?" was discussed,
but also "how could the government use chip cards to reduce people's
privacy?"  Here, the "hackers" were hackers in the positive sense of
understanding a technology, not in the negative sense of wreaking
havoc.  It was, however, noted that trying out a potential weakness of
the "EuroScheck" cash cards was quite easy:  it would require buying a
card reader for 1,500 DM and maybe a week of time. <p>

The question of technical solutions to "big brother" did come up in
the presentations about chip cards.  The danger is that a pile of cards
is eliminated in favor of a card containing someone's driver's license,
driving record (maybe), employee information, credit information, etc.
etc.  A chip card could theoretically be programmed to give out *only*
the information absolutely necessary, e.g. telling a policeman only
that someone is allowed to drive, without disclosing his identity. <p>

The "Hackzentrum" (Hacking Center) turned out to be a room filled
with networked computers and people hacking on them.  It seemed mostly
harmless.  (I nevertheless did not try a remote login -- I had no
reason to doubt good intentions, but on the other hand, who knows who
wrote or replaced the keyboard driver and what sort of supplemental
functionality it might have?)  The packet radio room had a "Digi"
repeating station and, true to the ham radio tradition, where the
conversation centers on who is talking to whom and how well they hear
each other and on what other frequency they might hear each other
better, the computers attached were mostly displaying maps of the
packet radio network itself.  I didn't delve very deeply into the
"Chaos Archive," but noticed a collection of maintenance sheets for
telephone equipment among CCC newsletters and other paraphenalia. <p>

Some "signs of the Congress": <p>

- Bumper sticker:  "I (heart) your computer"
    - Telephone stickers:  "Achtung, Abhoergefahr" ("Attention,
      Eavesdropping danger"; and the German PTT logo transformed into a
      pirate insignia, with the words "Telefun - Mobilpunk" (derived from
      "Telefon - Mobilfunk")
    - T-shirt:  "Watching them (eye-ball) watching us"
    - Post-It Note pad (for sale for DM 1.50):  a pad of about 50,
      pre-printed with a hand-written note:  "Vorsicht, Stoerung.
      Automat macht Karte ungueltig" ("Careful--Defect. Machine makes
      card invalid")
    - Word coinage:  "Gopher-space"
    - Stamp:  "ORIGINALE KOPIE" ("ORIGINAL COPY") <p>

The press were told not to take pictures of anyone without their
explicit permission. <p>

Schedules were distributed throughout the Congress.  By the evening
of the 27th, a schedule for the 28th, "Fahrplan 28.12 Version 2.0," was
already available ("Fahrplan" means a bus/train schedule; this is
presumably an "in" joke).  By 17:30 on the 28th, "Fahrplan 28.12
Version 2.7" was being distributed.  (I missed most of the intervening
versions; presumably they were neatly filed away in the Chaos Archive
by then ...) <p>

THE EAVESDROPPING ATTACK <p>

This has to do with a proposed law making its way through the German
Parliament.  The invitation describes this as "a proposed law reform
allowing state authorities to listen in, even in private rooms, in
order to fight organized crime."  This session was the centerpiece of
the Congress.  Bayerische Rundfunk, the Bavarian sender, sent a
reporter (or at least a big microphone with their logo on it).  The
panel consisted of: <p>

MdB - Mitglied des Bundestags (Member of Parliament) Peter Paterna
DsB - Datenschutz Beauftragter Hamburg (Data privacy official) Peter Schar
Journalist - from Die Zeit
PTT - a representative from the German PTT
Student - writing a book about related issues
CCC - a few members of the Chaos Computer Club <p>

My notes are significantly less than a word-for-word transcript.  In
the following, I have not only excerpted and translated, but
reorganized comments to make the threads easier to follow. <p>

IS IT JUSTIFIED? <p>

MdB - There is massive concern ("Beunruhigung") in Germany:  7 million
crimes last year.  Using the US as comparison for effectivity of
eavesdropping, it's only applicable in about 10-20 cases:  this has
nothing to do with the 7 million.  The congress is nevertheless
reacting to the 7 million, not to the specifics.  In principle, I am
opposed and have concerns about opening a Pandora's box. <p>

CCC #1 - The 7 million crimes does not surprise me in the least.  I am
convinced that there is a clear relationship between the number of laws
and the number of crimes.  When you make more laws, you have more
crimes.  Every second action in this country is illegal. <p>

Journalist - Laws/crimes correlation is an over-simplification.  There
are more murders, even though there are no more laws against it. <p>

MdB - There is a conflict between internal security, protecting the
constitution, and civil rights.  How dangerous  is 6 billion Marks of
washed drug money to the nation?  Taking the US as an example, the
corrosion may have gone so far that it's too late to undo it.  I hope
that this point hasn't been reached yet in Germany. <p>

DsB - I am worried about a slippery slope.  There is a tradeoff between
freedom and security, and this is the wrong place to make it; other
more effective measures aren't being taken up. <p>

EFFECTIVENESS OF CONTROLS ON EAVESDROPPING <p>

MdB - Supposedly federal controls are effective.  Although there are
very few eavesdropping cases, even if you look at those that are
court-approved, it's increasing exponentially.  No proper brakes are
built into the system.  As for controls for eavesdropping by the
intelligence service, there is a committee of  three members of
parliament, to whom all cases must be presented.  They have final say,
and I know one of the three, and have relatively much trust in him.
They are also allowed to go into any PTT facility anytime, unannounced,
to see whether or not something is being tapped or not. <p>

MdB - Policies for eavesdropping:  if no trace of an applicable
conversation is heard within the first "n" minutes, they must terminate
the eavesdropping [...]  The question is, at which point the most
effective brakes and regulations should be applied:  in the
constitution?  in the practice? <p>

PTT - True, but often the actual words spoken is not important, rather
who spoke with whom, and when. <p>

DsB - There is no catalog for crimes, saying what measures can be
applied in investigating which crimes.  It's quite possible to use them
for simple crimes, e.g. speeding.  There is no law saying that the PTT
*has to* store data; they *may*.  They can choose technical and
organizational solutions that don't require it. <p>

MdB - This is a valid point, I don't waive responsibility for such
details.  The PTT could be required to wipe out detailed information as
soon as it is no longer needed, e.g. after the customer has been billed
for a call. <p>

TECHNICAL TRENDS <p>

Journalist - Digital network techniques make it easy to keep trails,
and there is an electronic trail produced as waste product, which can
be used for billing as well as for other purposes.  Load measurements
are allowable, but it can also be used for tracking movements. <p>

DsB - The PTT claims they need detailed network data to better plan the
network.  The government says they need details in order to be able to
govern us better. <p>

DsB - In the past, the trend has always been to increasingly
identificable phone cards.  There is economic pressure on the customer
to use a billing card instead of a cash card, since a telephone unit
costs less.  With "picocells," your movement profile is getting more
and more visible. <p>

PTT - As for the trend towards less-anonymous billing-cards:  with the
new ISDN networks, this is necessary.  Billing is a major cost, and
this is just a technical priority. <p>

Student - As for techniques to reduce potential for eavesdropping, it
is for example technically possible to address a mobile phone without
the network operator needing to know its position.  Why aren't such
things being pursued? <p>

PTT - UMTS is quite preliminary and not necessarily economically
feasible.  [Comments about debit cards].  We have more interest in
customer trust than anything else. But when something is according to
the law, we have no option other than to carry it out.  But we don't do
it gladly. <p>

THE BIG CONSPIRACY? <p>

CCC #2 - I don't give a shit about these phone conversations being
overheard.  I want to know why there is such a big controversy.  Who
wants what?  Why is this so important?  Why so much effort?  Why are so
many Mafia films being shown on TV when the eavesdropping law is being
discussed?  What's up?  Why, and who are the people? <p>

Student - I am writing a book about this, and I haven't figured this
out myself.  My best theory:  there are some politicians who have lost
their detailed outlook ("Feinbild"), and they should be done away with
("abgeschaffen"). <p>

PTT - We're in a difficult position, with immense investments needed to
be able to overhear phone conversations [in digital networks (?)].  We
have no interest in a cover-up. <p>

MdB - As for the earlier question about what NATO countries may do.
During the occupation of Berlin, they did want they wanted on the
networks.  In western Germany, it has always been debated.  Funny
business has never been proved, nor has suspicion been cleared up. <p>

CCC #2 - After further thought, I have another theory.  American
companies are interested in spying on German companies in order to get
a jump on their product offerings. <p>

MdB - That's clear, but there are more benign explanations.  Government
offices tend towards creating work.  Individuals are promoted if their
offices expand, and they look for new fields to be busy in.  In Bonn,
we've gone from 4,000 people to 24,000 since the 50's. <p>

CCC #1 (to MdB) - Honestly, I don't see why you people in Bonn are
anything other than one of these impenetrable bureaucracies like you
described, inaccessible, out of touch with reality, and interested only
in justifying their own existence. <p>

MdB - Well, *my* federal government isn't that. <p>

CLIPPER CHIP CONTROVERSY <p>

Student - Observation/concern:  in the US, AT&amp;T's encryption system is
cheap and weak.  If this becomes a de facto standard, it is much harder
to introduce a better one later. <p>

Journalist - In the US, the Clipper chip controversy has centered more
on the lost business opportunities for encryption technology, not on
principles.  There every suggestion for forbidding encryption has
encountered stiff opposition. <p>

Student -  As for the Clipper algorithm, it's quite easy to invite
three experts to cursorily examine an algorithm (they weren't allowed
to take documents home to study it) and then sign-off that they have no
complaints. <p>

Journalist - As for the cursory rubber-stamping by the three experts
who certified the Clipper algorithm, my information is that they had
multiple days of computing days on a supercomputer available.  I don't
see a problem with the algorithm.  The problem lies in the "trust
centers" that manage the keys.  I personally don't see why the whole
question of cryptology is at all open ("zugaenglich") for the
government. <p>

CONCLUDING REMARKS <p>

DsB - The question is not only whether or not politicans are separated
from what the citizens want, but also of what the citizens want.
Germans have a tendency to valuing security.  Different tradition in
the US, and less eavesdropping.  I can imagine how the basic law
("Grundgesetz") could be eliminated in favor of regulations designed to
reduce eavesdropping, the trade-off you (MdB) mentioned earlier.  The
headlines would look like "fewer cases of eavesdropping", "checks built
in to the system," etc., everyone would be happy, and then once the law
has been abolished, it would creep back up, and then there's no limit. <p>

MdB - (Nods agreement) <p>

CCC #2 - There are things that must be administered centrally (like the
PTT), and the government is the natural choice, but I suggest that we
don't speak of the "government," but rather of "coordination."  This
reduces the perceived "required power" aspect ... As a closing remark,
I would like to suggest that we take a broader perspective, assume that
a person may commit e.g. 5,000 DM more of theft in his lifetime, live
with that, and save e.g. 100,000 DM in taxes trying to prevent this
degree of theft. <p>

<hr>
MEDIA AND INFORMATION STRUCTURES <p>

In this session, a lot of time was wasted in pointless philosophical
discussion of what is meant by Truth, although once this topic was
forcefully ignored, some interesting points came up (I don't
necessarily agree or disagree with these): <p>

- In electronic media, the receiver has more responsibility for judging
truth placed on his shoulders.  He can no longer assume that the sender
is accountable.  With "Network Trust," you would know someone who knows
what's worthwhile, rather than filtering the deluge yourself.  A
primitive form of this already exists in the form of Usenet "kill" files. <p>

- A large portion of Usenet blather is due to people who just got their
accounts cross-posting to the entire world.  The actual posting is not
the problem, rather that others follow it up with a few dozen messages
debating whether or not it's really mis-posted, or argue that they
should stop discussing it, etc.  People are beginning to learn however,
and the ripple effect is diminishing. <p>

- Companies such as Microsoft are afraid of the Internet, because its
distributed form of software development means they are no longer the
only ones able to marshal 100 or 1,000 people for a windowing system
like X-Windows or Microsoft Windows. <p>

- If someone is trying to be nasty and knows what he's doing, a Usenet
posting can be made to cost $500,000 in network bandwidth, disk space, etc. <p>

- At a Dutch university, about 50% of the network bandwidth could have
been saved if copies of Playboy were placed in the terminal rooms.
Such technical refinements as Gopher caching daemons pale in comparison. <p>

- All e-mail into or out of China goes through one node.  Suspicious,
isn't it? <p>

<hr>
ALTERNATIVE NETWORKS <p>

Several people reported about computer networks they set up and are
operating.  A sampling: <p>

APS+Hacktic - Rop Gonggrijp reported about networking services for the
masses, namely Unix and Internet for about $15 per month, in Holland.
There are currently 1,000 subscribers, and the funding is sufficient to
break even and to expand to keep up with exponential demand. <p>

A German reported about efforts to provide e-mail to regions of
ex-Yugoslavia that are severed from one another, either due to
destroyed telephone lines or to phone lines being shut off by the
government.  A foundation provided them with the funds to use London
(later Vienna), which is reachable from both regions, as a common node. <p>

The original author of the Zerberus mail system used on many private
German networks complained about the degree of meta-discussion and how
his program was being used for people to complain about who is paying
what for networking services and so forth.  He said he did not create
it for such non-substantial blather.  The difference between now and
several years ago is that now there are networks that work,
technically, and the problem is how to use them in a worthwhile manner. <p>

A German of Turkish origin is trying to allow Turks in Turkey to
participate in relevant discussions going on on German networks (in
German) and is providing translating services (if I heard right, some
of this was being done in Sweden).  This killed the rest of the
session, which degenerated into a discussion of which languages
were/are/should be used on which networks. <p>

<hr>
HOW AN INTELLIGENCE SERVICE WORKS:  STASI TRAINING VIDEOS <p>

The person introducing the videos sat on the stage, the room
darkened.  The camera blotted out his upper body and face; all that was
to see on the video, projected behind him, was a pair of hands moving
around. <p>

It apparently didn't take much to earn a file in the Stasi archives.
And once you were in there, the "10 W's:  Wo/wann/warum/mit wem/..."
("where/when/why/with whom/...") ensured that the file, as well as
those of your acquaintances, grew. <p>

The videos reported the following "case studies": <p>

- The tale of "Eva," whose materialistic lifestyle, contacts with
Western capitalists, and "Abenteuerromantik" tendencies made her a
clear danger to the state, as well as a valuable operative.  She swore
allegiance to the Stasi and was recruited.  Eventually the good working
relationship deteriorated, and the Stasi had to prevent her from trying
to escape to the West.  The video showed how the different parts of the
intelligence service worked together. <p>

- A member of the military made a call to the consulate of West
Germany in Hungary.  The list of 10,000 possible travellers to Hungary
in the relevant time frame was narrowed down to 6,000 on the basis of a
determination of age and accent from the recorded conversation, then
down to 80 by who would have any secrets to sell, then down to three
(by hunch?  I don't remember now). <p>

One video showed how a subversive was discreetly arrested.  Cameras
throughout the city were used to track his movements.  When he arrived
at his home, a few workers were "fixing" the door, which they claimed
couldn't be opened at the moment.  They walked him over to the next
building to show him the entrance, and arrested him there.  A dinky
little East German car comes up, six people pile into it.  Two
uniformed police stand on the sidewalk pretending nothing is happening. <p>

wiretaps from Privacy digest <p>

Date:    Sun, 9 Jan 1994 17:41:52 -0500 (EST)
From:    John Higgins &lt;higgins@dorsai.dorsai.org&gt;
Subject: wiretaps <p>

Are the cops tapping your phone? If you live in Oklahoma, Rhode Island or
Virginia, probably not. But if you're really paranoid don't move to New York
City, New Jersey or Florida. <p>

On Jan. 9. New York Newsday published an article on wiretaps listing them by
location. Citing a report compiled by the Administrative Office of the United
States Courts, the article said that New York State cops lead the country with
197 wiretaps installed in 1992. The aforementioned low-tap states reported
intalling just 1 phone or room bug, but of the 39 states that have wiretap
statutes 17 reported no taps AT ALL (no, I don't know which states those are). <p>

Of the federal jurisdictions not on the list, 44 reported fewer than 10 taps
for the year, including 19 who reported one tap and 36 who reported zero. <p>

I know that cops hate wiretaps, especially room bugs because they're so labor
intensive, but this doesn't seem like a whole lot of wiretaps in some of these
areas. Only seven local taps in Massachusetts? Three state wiretaps in all of
California? If these are accurate reports, this is far less pervasive than I
would have expected. <p>

"INDUSTRY DEFIES CLINTON ON DATA ENCRYPTION" -- John Markoff <p>

"INDUSTRY DEFIES CLINTON ON DATA ENCRYPTION" -- John Markoff <p>

[The following item is copyrighted by the 1994 N.Y. Times, and appeared on
Thursday, 13 Jan 1994.] <p>

REDWOOD CITY, Calif.  The Clinton administration's newly articulated
information technology policy of persuasion, rather than dictation, is getting
an early test.
   At an industry conference in Redwood City this week, computer hardware,
software and telecommunications companies as well as a major bank, are saying
they intend to adopt an industry coding standard for protecting the privacy of
electronic communications, rather than support a standard being pushed by the
administration.
   Unlike the administration-backed standard, the technology, which has been
commercialized by RSA Data Security Inc., does not provide an electronic
``trapdoor'' that would enable law-enforcement agencies to eavesdrop on
digital communications.
   The administration, whose standard is known as the Clipper chip, contends
that a trapdoor is necessary to detect criminal activity or espionage because
sophisticated encryption techniques can make digital phone calls or computer
communications nearly impervious to wiretaps.
   Wednesday, Hewlett Packard Co. became the last of the leading United States
computer companies to license the RSA software, joining Apple Computer, IBM,
Sun Microsystems, Digital Equipment and Unisys.
   Several companies announced at the conference that they planned to begin
selling products that embed RSA's software. Among them are General Magic, a
software developer; National Semiconductor; a consortium of five cellular data
companies, and Bankers Trust Co.
   The conference was sponsored by RSA, which is based in Redwood City, and
attracted many of the nation's best non-government cryptographers a group of
code makers and code breakers who have generally been hostile to any form of
government restrictions on their technology.
   They have sparred for more than a decade with the National Security Agency,
the main proponent of the Clipper chip. The agency is responsible for
monitoring electronic communications worldwide for the government, in the name
of national security.
   In addition to opposition from the cryptographers, the government's Clipper
chip proposal has already stirred bitter opposition from civil liberties
organizations and computer user groups, who fear the Clipper chip would make
electronic communications too easy for anyone to eavesdrop.
   Now the industry's rush to embrace an encryption standard that does not
provide a way for the government to listen to data or voice conversations is
certain to put new pressure on the Clinton administration, which is now in the
final stages of a classified review of its Clipper standard.
   ``It's clear that what is going on here today is contrary to the way the
NSA wants the world to move,'' said Lynn McNulty, associate director for
computer security at the National Institute for Standards and Technology, a
Commerce Department agency. The institute proposed the Clipper standard last
April, although most of its technical development was done by NSA researchers.
   Despite their defiance, researchers attending the conference worried that
the government might still have the means to enforce its vision of a coding
standard.
   ``They have the trump card that we don't have,'' said Bruce Schneier, a
former government cryptography researcher, who is the author of a textbook
titled ``Applied Cryptography.'' ``They could make it a law that it's
mandatory to use their standard.'' <p>

&gt; &gt; This is possible, but, having seen the issue come up in the context of the
&gt; &gt; Federal Networking Council and FNC AC already, there might be good reasons
&gt; &gt; for having an Advisory Committee resource *not* be on a Federal government
&gt; &gt; site.   This would have to do with what could or couldn't be made public,
&gt; &gt; when and how, with respect to FOIA rules, statutory requirements, etc.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;    Ross, you have raised this issue before, according to scott Armstrong,
&gt;    of ways that federal agencies can get around FOIA.  Is there really any
&gt;    reason why a federal advisory board that wants to make decisions that
&gt;    will influence our telecommunications policy should not use a system that
&gt;    is subject to FOIA?  What could possible be discussed that should not be
&gt;    part of the public record?
&gt;     jamie <p>

Hold the phone!  This is NOT a question of trying to "get around FOIA." <p>

We're talking about a private sector advisory committee to the federal
government, chartered according to the provisions of the Federal Advisory
Committee Act which requires, i.a., that its meetings be announced in
advance in the Federal Register, that all meeting sessions be open to the
public unless specified to be closed in the meeting announcement, that
closing a session can only be done for a VERY few reasons, and that
meeting minutes be kept. <p>

Thus the deliberations of an advisory committee are open to the public -
both at meetings and via the minutes, and any reports the committee might
make and deliver to the government are thereupon subject to FOIA. <p>

BUT: There is (as far as I know) NO law (FOIA or other) that
correspondence (electronic or otherwise) among advisory committee members
be public.  Nor if that correspondence were stored on the computers of the
committee members or any other private machine need it be open to the
public.  BUT, if it were stored on a government computer, it WOULD be
subject to FOIA. Thus the government, in trying to accommodate its
advisory committee by providing storage, would subject its members to
unwarranted invasion of their privacy which is not required by law. <p>

This is NOT a question of trying to "get around FOIA," but of avoiding its
inappropriate application. <p>

In the discussion of whether the NII advisory council related
correspondence would be available via FOIA, I think we can look at what
happened when Hillary Rodham Clinton tried to keep the deliberations of
her health care advisory committee secret.  Bottom line was, she wasn't
able to. <p>

I think Steve and Jamie both have valid points.  Steve is certainly right
on when he outlined how the FNC is set up and the guidelines it uses,
even when there is a closed meeting.  As he said, if one wants to find
out what happened, they can get ahold of the minutes. <p>

However, Jamie also has a point when he's talking about the difference
between private email between members of the AC *not* related to the NII.
That correspondence can certainly go through other channels, not simply
out to some NII-AC-LIST. <p>

I also wouldn't be worried about anyone involved trying to "get around"
FOIA requirements.  If the AC follows the lead of Steve Wolff, there's
certainly nothing to worry about.  Steve has set an outstanding example
of a government official complying with FOIA requests, especially as they
relate to electronic mail.  He should get an award for that effort. <p>

Notes from RSA Data Security Conference <p>

Notes from RSA Data Security Conference <p>

Stephen Walker
                 Trusted Information Systems
                    January 18, 1994 <p>

Over 400 people attended the third RSA Data Security Conference
on January 12-14, 1994, at the Hotel Sofitel in Redwood City, CA. <p>

William Murray, of Deloitte &amp; Touche, gave the keynote
presentation in which he described the major developments in
cryptography in this century. He stated that cryptography is now
cheap enough to be used by default but warned that the quantity
of information that could benefit from use of cryptography is
going up faster than its use. He cited "ambivalent government
policies" as the main impediment to wide use of cryptography but
added that these issues will not be decided by government but by
the public, as individuals buy specific cryptographic products. <p>

Over a dozen major companies announced a wide array of products
that are now or will soon be available using RSA technologies.
Among them were Hewlett-Packard, National Semiconductor, Apple,
McCaw Cellular, and Novell. <p>

A Cryptographers Expert Panel headed by Peter Neumann came to the
tentative conclusion that the best follow-on to the Data
Encryption Standard (DES) may well be triple DES (in the encrypt-
decrypt-encrypt mode). There would be no need to search for a new
standard. The fifteen or more years of confidence building
analysis already applied to DES would be immediately applicable.
The extra cost of running triple DES could be recovered in
improved hardware speeds. <p>

Following a question as to how to provide a means for recovering
encrypted data for which the key has been lost (the locksmith
function), it was pointed out that there is a big difference
between encryption used for data communications and that used for
data storage. The assumption is that encrypted messages in
transit have little value since if they are lost they can be re-
sent. Encrypted data in storage, on the other hand, has great
value. The cryptographic community has not spent enough effort
developing techniques for these storage issues. This is a major
topic that cryptographers will have to tackle in the future. <p>

In a Government panel, Lynn McNulty of NIST summarized the status
of NIST's standards efforts: <p>

-    DES recertified for five years, <p>

-    FIPS 140-1, Security Requirements for Cryptographic
          Modules has been approved, and <p>

-    Nothing to say on the Digital Signature Standard (DSS)
          or the Escrowed Encryption Standard, but perhaps
          something will happen soon. <p>

Bruce Heiman, of Preston Gates, summarized the industry
objections to the present government export rules, and Whit
Diffie, standing in for Clint Brooks, of NSA, who could not
attend, gave a briefing on what he thought Clint might have
wanted to say concerning the national security side of the
cryptography argument. <p>

Dave Sobel, of CPSR, in discussing the Clipper initiative, stated
that he did not believe that Congress intended in the Computer
Security Act of 1987 that NIST put forth a classified encryption
algorithm for protecting the public's unclassified
communications. He also brought out several Constitutional
arguments regarding Clipper. As a first amendment issue, he cited
problems with any government activity that attempts to regulate
how we communicate. As the fourth amendment issue, in answering
the question "Can the government seek to ensure its ability to
collect information by imposing new restrictions such as key
escrow?", he stated a basic premise of the Bill of Rights that,
to protect average citizens from an overzealous government, "law
enforcement is supposed to be difficult."  As a fifth amendment
issue regarding the prohibition against self incrimination, he
stated that key escrow amounts to a surrender of this right in
order to communicate. <p>

Steve Kent, of BBN, described the ACM-sponsored Cryptographic
Policy Panel, which started last fall and will issue a report
"mid-year."  The panel will not issue recommendations but,
rather, a better articulation of the issues, attempting to
separate facts, opinions, and future speculations. <p>

Rumors flowed freely that "within two weeks" the government would
proceed with the licensing of the Digital Signature Algorithm to
Public Key Partners.  This would result in the promulgation of
the DSS inspite of overwhelming public comment opposing it. <p>

Rumors aside, it is clear from this conference that a substantial
portion of the market place has decided to use RSA-based public
key cryptography in a wide spectrum of generally available
products. <p>

Professor Farber: <p>

Erich Bloch, whom I work with at the Council on Competitiveness, thought
your "Interesting People" bulletin board might be interested in the
Council's recently released report, COMPETITION POLICY: UNLOCKING THE
NATIONAL INFORMATION INFRASTRUCTURE.  We would greatly appreciate it if
you could make the following Press Release, Forward and Executive Summary
available to them.  Thank you in advance for your help! <p>

PRESS RELEASE <p>

COMPETITION POLICY CONSENSUS FORGED BY COMPETITORS <p>

The Council on Competitiveness has released a report on competition policy
that includes an unprecedented consensus among AT&amp;T, regional bell
companies, and the full range of information infrastructure providers.  The
report, Competition Policy: Unlocking the National Information
Infrastructure, is the second in a series of policy reports of the
Council's 21st century information infrastructure project chaired by John
Young, former CEO of Hewlett- Packard and Charles Vest, president of the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  "This report marks the first time
that representatives from long distance and local telephone companies,
alternative access providers, cable companies, utilities, information
companies, users, academic institutions, labor unions and public interest
groups have agreed on the need for full competition in the communications
market and hammered out a transition framework to get us there," said Paul
Allaire the new chairman of the Council on Competitiveness and CEO of Xerox
Corporation.  "By stimulating competition at home, consumers will benefit
from greater choice, lower prices, and enhanced services.  Moreover,
U.S.-based firms will gain a competitive edge in world markets." <p>

The essential framework contained in this report applies to all providers
and addresses four interlocking issues.  Recommendations reflect consensus
on the following: <p>

1.  Agreement by all providers, including the local telephone companies, to
provide access to their essential services.  This "unbundling" of services
will speed the competitive interconnection and interoperability that are
essential to developing a national information infrastructure. <p>

2.  Agreement to reduce the debate about entry into restricted lines of
business to two options.  Everyone agrees that essential facilities must
first be opened to competitors and regulatory safeguards must be in place
to prevent predatory pricing and cross-subsidies.  They differ only on
whether competitors must also gain a predetermined share of the incumbent
provider's market before restrictions to enter new lines of business are
lifted. <p>

3.  Agreement to provide dominant providers more pricing freedom (with
certain cap and
floor limits during the transition).  This agreement will provide
incentives for dominant
providers to lower costs, a key to ensuring universal service. <p>

4.  Agreement that support for universal service should be shared by
providers of essential services, and directed to users.  Also, that any
universal service program should include those services that are necessary
to maintaining U.S.  competitiveness. <p>

"It is remarkable that we could agree that in the end, everyone should be
able to enter all lines of business," said John Young.  "In doing so, the
private sector has provided some fundamental guidelines for the
Administration and Congress as they develop national policy in this
critical area." <p>

The Council on Competitiveness is a coalition of chief executives from
leading businesses, presidents of universities and presidents of labor
unions whose mission is to improve the competitiveness of U.S.  industry
and its workers in a global marketplace.  #### <p>

The following statement by the Vice President was released by the White
House on December 16, 1993: <p>

"If America is to develop a world class information superhighway, we must
promote healthy competition at home -- competition that enhances consumer
benefits, stimulates the development of new products and services,
unleashes new technologies, and gives U.S.  based firms an edge in world
markets.  The Council's report, Competition Policy: Unlocking the National
Information Infrastructure, outlines a policy framework designed to do just
that.  We will consider it carefully as we develop our legislative package
in this area."

The report can be ordered from the Council on Competitiveness at a cost of
US $25.00 plus shipping and handling (domestic) and $3.50 (overseas). <p>

COMPETITION POLICY:  UNLOCKING THE NATIONAL INFORMATION
INFRASTRUCTURE <p>

FOREWORD <p>

America s information infrastructure is evolving faster than anyone
thought possible.  Although the Clinton Administration came to office
promising to accelerate deployment of the information superhighway, the
private sector has been the real driving force behind progress. <p>

The past few months have witnessed a string of proposed mergers and
acquisitions.  U.S.  West announced that it would acquire 25 percent of
Time Warner, the nation s second largest cable network.  AT&amp;T announced
plans to acquire McCaw Cellular Communications, America s largest cellular
telephone company.  Bell Atlantic announced its decision to merge with
Tele-Communications, Inc.  (TCI), America s largest cable corporation.
Bell South decided to link with Prime Management s cable systems.
Southwestern Bell decided to purchase cable systems from Hauser
Communications.  NYNEX announced its intention to invest in Viacom. <p>

These new alliances and others are fundamentally reshaping the information
and communications industry.  Until recently, cable, telephone,
broadcasting, computing, publishing, wireless communications and utilities
were viewed as separate businesses.  The steady push of market forces and
the rush of technology are rapidly breaking down the walls separating these
markets. <p>

Despite this market convergence, much of America s regulatory framework
remains rooted in yesterday s notion of distinct and separate businesses.
Many government officials have greeted with skepticism the announcements
about major mergers and acquisitions.  While the government s concerns
about equal access and fair prices are serious ones that must be addressed
carefully, they must be balanced against efforts to speed the realization
of the new national information infrastructure. <p>

Today s market shifts represent the beginnings of the new information
network that will be at the center of tomorrow s economy.  Just as no
manager or analyst can accurately predict the contours of this
infrastructure, neither can any government official.  If the government
insists on overly restrictive regulations, America s ability to create the
new information infrastructure will be in jeopardy.  What the urgency of
the marketplace and the unrelenting onrush of technology require are fewer
regulations, not more. <p>

This interim policy report is the Council s attempt to understand the
competitive pressures driving the evolution of the U.S.-based
communications industry.  In it, we offer the best-thinking of a broad
cross-section of the private sector on this complex and at times highly
contentious set of issues.  Many diverse industry groups, as well as
academia and labor, helped forge the consensus represented in these pages. <p>

We recognize that we do not have all of the answers and that we do not
address all the concerns surrounding the evolution of the information
infrastructure.  Given the complexity of the issue and the competing
interests involved, not everyone agrees on every detail of every point in
this report.  What we offer is a consensus framework -- one that lays the
foundation for the transition to a fully competitive U.S.  communications
market that will drive America s economic performance and standard of
living in the future. <p>

We hope that this framework will help inform the public policy debate, and
we stand ready to do whatever we can to assist that process. <p>

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY <p>

In its report, Vision for a 21st Century Information Infrastructure, the
Council articulated a vision for a new national information infrastructure
(NII): <p>

The information infrastructure will enable all Americans to access
information and communicate with each other easily, reliably, securely and
cost effectively in any medium -- voice, data, image or video -- anytime,
anywhere.  This capability will enhance the productivity of work and lead
to dramatic improvements in social services, education and entertainment. <p>

This report expands on that vision, focusing on the need for a competitive
communications environment as a prerequisite for a versatile information
infrastructure.  By creating an environment in which U.S.-based firms are
permitted to compete and encouraged to take advantage of the information
infrastructure, we can sharpen America's performance in world markets and
advance national interests.  The efficiencies that result from competition
will induce cost reductions and lower prices, increase demand for services
and products, and expand output of new applications, all to the benefit of
the consumer.  The market is already responding.  The recent spate of
planned strategic alliances among the telephone, cable, wireless and
entertainment companies, coupled with the emergence of small local exchange
competitors, indicates that a dramatic and volatile restructuring of the
communications industry is beginning and will continue for some time.  No
one can foresee the outcome.  But the driving forces are becoming clear. <p>

There is no question that the nation is in a profound economic transition.
 As often happens during periods of transition, however, the government is
struggling to keep pace with market developments.  Laws, regulations and
governing processes, created under different market conditions and social
environments, should be adapted to new circumstances.  Competition is
colliding with the regulated monopoly framework in the local cable and
telecommunications services markets.  The NII will only develop fully if
competition can flourish at all levels of network operations and service
provision.  It is imperative that industry and government focus on removing
obstacles to competition in the immediate future. <p>

This report offers a framework for developing the transitional rules
required to ensure that a competitive communications environment emerges.
It applies to all U.S.-based providers -- long distance and local telephone
companies, cable companies, alternative access providers and power
companies.  It is particularly relevant to the local services market, where
the regulated monopoly framework is colliding with competition.  While the
issues this framework confronts are well known, they have been dealt with
in a piece-meal fashion.  This approach has contributed to today s
fragmented regulatory and policy structure.  The Council believes these
issues are inextricably linked and should be addressed concurrently to
assure a coherent transition to a fully competitive marketplace. <p>

FINDINGS <p>

1) TECHNOLOGY AND MARKETS ARE FUSING. <p>

New technologies and the prospect of an explosion in "tele-information"
applications are forcing a restructuring of the communications industry.
Companies that have traditionally seen themselves in fully separate and
unrelated lines of business are finding themselves in direct competition
with each other.  At the same time, companies and industries are merging.
The term "telecommunications" has become too limiting to describe an
industry that is being redefined to include the creation, processing,
storage and delivery of voice, data, images and video.  The broader terms
"communications" and "information" are more accurate descriptors.  Along
with this redefinition, the long held tenet that the local communications
market is a natural monopoly is eroding.  The very definition of a "local
exchange" may be obsolete.  Technologies are offering the potential for
choice, and entrepreneurial firms are capitalizing on this potential in
niche markets. <p>

2) REGULATIONS AND POLICIES ARE FRAGMENTED. <p>

Current government policy views components of the communications sector as
businesses restricted to traditional markets, despite the fact that
technology is drawing them into new ones.  Regulatory oversight and policy
development are fragmented.  They are dispersed among local regulatory
bodies, fifty-two state public utility commissions, Congress, the Federal
Communications Commission (FCC), the Executive Branch (National
Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), Office of Science
and Technology Policy (OSTP) and other Administration agencies), and the
courts. <p>

3) IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO PREDICT ACCURATELY THE FUTURE PATH OF THE MARKET OR
TECHNOLOGY.  The current market is fluid.  New companies and new
technologies are emerging at a breathtaking pace.  No one is certain which
technologies will succeed, which of the proposed mergers will work, or
which products and services the market will demand. <p>

4) GIVEN THE DRAMATIC RESTRUCTURING UNDERWAY, THE KEY ISSUE IS NOT
WHETHER, BUT WHEN AND UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS, TO PERMIT FULL COMPETITION IN
ALL MARKETS.  Ultimately, any vendor should be able to offer any
communications service to anyone anywhere using any technology.  In the
present market environment, regulated monopolies dominate certain segments,
and state and federal regulations restrict companies from offering certain
services.  Given this fact, government officials should recognize the need
for less regulation, not more, so that the market can proceed. <p>

RECOMMENDATIONS <p>

As policy makers develop the regulations and policies required to make the
transition to a fully competitive market, they must ensure that the process
is evenhanded.  The policy context should be industry neutral and
technology neutral.  Policy makers should focus on ensuring that the
consumer has a choice of providers, products and services at reasonable
prices.  Users and providers should be able to respond to market
opportunities without undue regulatory burden.  Marketplace rules should
permit competition and encourage technology investment.  Essential
regulation that ensures fairness should be encouraged while excessive
regulation that stifles innovation should be eliminated. <p>

The Council has four recommendations for policy makers and U.S.-based
companies that provide a core framework for developing the transition rules
required to move to a fully competitive market.  These recommendations
should be addressed concurrently since the issues they concern are
interlocking. <p>

1) ENSURE INTERCONNECTION AND INTEROPERABILITY AMONG NETWORKS.  All
providers should be able to combine their facilities in a building-block
approach.  Elements of local distribution facilities, switch, transport and
ancillary services should be unbundled and priced separately.  Operational
features, such as switching elements, transport elements, signalling
systems and databases, that allow the network and its users to find each
other, to be found and to connect, are "essential facilities." Access to
these facilities is key to increased competition. <p>

2) REMOVE BARRIERS TO MARKET ENTRY.  This recommendation applies both to
new U.S.-based entrants into an incumbent provider s market and to
incumbent providers into currently restricted lines of business.  This
includes telephone companies entering the cable market, cable companies
entering the telephone market, new providers (including power companies)
entering the local services market, local service providers entering the
long distance market, etc.  Federal and state policies should be aligned to
permit competition in all seg
ments of the communications market. <p>

There is strong disagreement about which is the best policy path to pursue
with respect to incumbent entry into currently restricted lines of
business.  Out of the multitude of proposals, the Council has narrowed the
debate to two options.  They differ on whether competitors should gain a
predetermined share of the incumbent provider s market before the incumbent
provider is permitted to enter other lines of business. <p>

Option One
Permit a dominant provider, whether cable, telephone, power or
some other company, to enter other lines of business (including long
distance, manufacturing and/or video programming) as soon as: 1) essential
facilities are open to all providers and 2) regulatory safeguards are in
place to prevent anti-competitive and monopolistic behavior during the
transition to a fully competitive market. <p>

Option Two <p>

Permit a dominant provider, whether cable, telephone, power or some other
company, to enter other lines of business (including long distance,
manufacturing and/or video programming) as soon as: 1) essential facilities
are open to all providers, 2) regulatory safeguards are in place to prevent
anti-competitive and monopolistic behavior during the transition to a fully
competitive market and 3) competitors have achieved a predetermined share
of the dominant provider s market. <p>

3) LET PRICES REFLECT COMPETITIVE MARKET CONDITIONS.  Transitional
regulations must balance protection against monopoly pricing abuse and
cross-subsidies with the regulated incumbent provider s desire to respond
to competition.  Currently, incumbent providers have limited ability to
adjust their prices to respond to new competitors.  As competition
increases, they should be granted greater pricing flexibility.  During the
transition phase, there should be price ceilings to protect customers from
excessive rate increases and price floors to protect nascent competition.
As incumbent providers are permitted to enter other businesses, safeguards
should be adopted to prevent cross-subsidization. <p>

4) PROTECT UNIVERSAL SERVICE AND SHARE ITS COSTS.  As competition emerges,
adjustments must be made to ensure universal service.  Where required,
assistance should be directed to end-users so that they can purchase
services from competitive providers.  Providers of essential services
should equitably share the responsibility of contributing this support.
Policies that encourage competition should result in providers reducing
their costs.  As lower costs are translated into lower prices, fewer
customers will require support mechanisms for essential services.  This
report does not attempt to redefine universal service nor does it discuss
whether all Americans should have access to some base level of educational
or cultural services distributed over the information infrastructure.  We
believe, however, that the definition of essential services should be
reviewed and periodically updated.  If new services have emerged that are
essential to U.S.  competitiveness, they should be considered for inclusion
in the universal service program. <p>

ABOUT THE COUNCIL <p>

Founded in 1986, the Council on Competititveness is a nonprofit,
nonpartisan organization of chief executives from business, higher
education and organized labor who have joined together to pursue a single
overriding goal: to improve the ability of American companies and workers
to compete more effectively in world markets, while maintaining a rising
standard of living at home. <p>

To build consensus within the public- and private-sectors on the actions
needed to help Americans compete, the Council pursues a three-part agenda:
increase public awareness of the breadth and severity of America's economic
problems; mobilize the political will required to set the United States on
a positive economic course; and assist in the development of specific
public policies and private-sector initiatives.  To that end, the Council
focuses on issues in the areas of fiscal policy, science and technology,
international economics and trade, and human resources. <p>

The Council is governed by an executive committee and draws on the
resources of its national affiliates -- over forty trade associations,
professional societies and research organizations -- to help analyze issues
and develop consensus.  The Council is privately supported through
contributions from its members, foundations and other granting
institutions. <p>

*Antilex*:  (n)  a variant on _Cylex_ published by a shifting
coalition of _e-pubs_ who feel that Cylex is often both
inaccurate (because slanted toward the government viewpoint)
and out of date. <p>

*autolott*:  (n)  short for *auto*mated *lott*ery, this is the
standard form of lottery now run by most major companies, the
federal government, and all state governments except Utah.
Most digital transfers now automatically cause the
destination/recipient to be encoded and dropped into a lottery
pool, from which prize drawings are then made.  This form of
lottery, in which one does not have to actively play to win, is an
outgrowth of the credit-card pools of the 1990s. Autolotts were
devised in part as a corporate marketing method to get around
the highly successful _doorman_ programs. <p>

*black bank*:  (n) an underground institution for generating and
distributing digital signatures outside the government-approved
three-bank scheme.  Black banks tend to be small and to go in
and out of business quickly as they are usually unable to sustain
the integrity of their security schemes and thus can lose all their
business literally overnight.  Although not technically illegal,
they cater to an amorphous and shifting population of criminals
and _clans_ who for one reason or another don't trust the
integrity of the national digital-signature scheme.  The Russian,
South African, Korean, and Caribbean mafias are all known to
run their own black banks. <p>

*bureaucrat*:  (n) obsolete; see _hulk_. <p>

*bodyguard*:  (n) general term covering localized software that
searches out and destroys viruses, worms, trojan horses,
scavengers, and other net wildlife. The U.S. government has
imposed severe restrictions on bodyguards to ensure that they
don't run loose in the net. (See also: _cannibal, hulk._) <p>

*borden*:  (n) any nondigital object that figures as evidence in
a legal proceeding, especially under criminal law.  Since most
legal proceedings are now carried out entirely in cyberspace,
lawyers have largely lost the ability to sway juries by showing
them physical evidence of crimes. In cases where such evidence
is important, prosecutors (rarely defense lawyers) often pursue
strategies to get the case transferred from cyberspace to real-
space courtrooms.  Hence (v) _to borden_ means to obtain or
try to obtain such a change of venue.  The word derives
indirectly from the b <p>

============================================================================= <p>

What's this?  This is the initial announcement and invitation to DEF CON ][,
a convention for the "underground" elements of the computer culture.  We try
to target the (Fill in your favorite word here): Hackers, Phreaks, Hammies,
Virii coders, programmers, crackers, Cyberpunk Wannabees, Civil Liberties
Groups, CypherPunks, Futurists, Artists, Etc.. <p>

WHO:   You know who you are, you shady characters.
WHAT:  A convention for you to meet, party, and listen to some speeches
       that you would normally never hear.
WHEN:  July 22, 23, 24 - 1994
WHERE: Las Vegas, Nevada @ The Sahara Hotel <p>

So you heard about DEF CON I, and want to hit part ][?  You heard about the
parties, the info discussed, the bizarre atmosphere of Las Vegas and want to
check it out in person?  Load up your laptop muffy, we're heading to Vegas! <p>

Here is what Three out of Three people said about last years convention: <p>

"DEF CON I, last week in Las Vegas, was both the strangest and the best
computer event I have attended in years." -- Robert X. Cringely, Info World <p>

"Toto, I don't think we're at COMDEX anymore." -- Coderipper, Gray Areas <p>

"Soon we were at the hotel going through the spoils: fax sheets, catalogs,
bits of torn paper, a few McDonald's Dino-Meals and lots of coffee grounds.
The documents disappeared in seconds."  -- Gillian Newson, New Media Magazine <p>

DESCRIPTION: <p>

Last year we held DEF CON I, which went over great, and this year we are
planning on being bigger and better.  We have expanded the number of
speakers to included midnight tech talks and additional speaking on Sunday.
We attempt to bring the underground into contact with "legitimate" speakers.
Sure it's great to meet and party with fellow hackers, but besides that we
try to provide information and speakers in a forum that can't be found at
other conferences. <p>

While there is an initial concern that this is just another excuse for the
evil hackers to party and wreak havok, it's just not the case.  People come
to DEF CON for information and for making contacts.  We strive to distinguish
this convention from others in that respect. <p>

WHAT'S NEW THIS YEAR: <p>

This year will be much larger and more organized than last year.  We have a
much larger meeting area, and have better name recognition.  Because of this
we will have more speakers on broader topics.  Expect speaking to run
Saturday and Sunday, ending around 5 p.m.  Some of the new things expected
include: <p>

o An INet connection with sixteen ports will be there, _BUT_ will only
  provide serial connections because terminals are too hard to ship.  So
  bring a laptop with communications software if you want to connect to the
  network.  Thanks to cyberlink communications for the connection. <p>

o There will be door prizes, and someone has already donated a Cell Phone
  to give away. <p>

o Dr. Ludwig will present his virii creation awards on Sunday. <p>

o A bigger and better "Spot The Fed" contest, which means more shirts to
  give away. <p>

o More room, we should have tables set up for information distribution.
  If you have anything you want distributed, feel free to leave it on the
  designated tables.  Yes, this year there will be a true 24 hour
  convention space. <p>

o A 24 hour movie / video suite where we will be playing all type of stuff.
  VHS Format.  Mail me with suggested titals to show, or bring your own. <p>

o Midnight Tech Talks on Friday and Saturday night to cover the more
  technical topics and leave the days free for more general discussions. <p>

WHO IS SPEAKING: <p>

I was going to run a list of the current speakers we have lined up, but at
this point things are still fluid.  In a few months when the speakers list
is more solidified I will release it.  I'll name the poeple who have
committed to attending in the next announcement.  Trust me. <p>

WHERE THIS THING IS: <p>

It's in Las Vegas, the town that never sleeps.  Really. There are no clocks
anywhere in an attempt to lull you into believing the day never ends.  Talk
about virtual reality, this place fits the bill with no clunky hardware.  If
you have a buzz you may never know the difference.  It will be at the Sahara
Hotel.  Intel as follows: <p>

The Sahara Hotel: 1.800.634.6078
        Room Rates: Single/Double $55, Tripple $65, Suite $120
                    (Usually $200) + 8% tax
        Transportation: Shuttles from the airport for cheap <p>

NOTE:  Please make it clear you are registering for the DEF CON ][
   convention to get the room rates.  Our convention space price is
   based on how many people register.  Register under a false name if
   it makes you feel better, 'cuz the more that register the better for
   my pocket book.  No one under 21 can rent a room by themselves, so
   get your buddy who is 21 to rent for you and crash out.  Don't let
   the hotel people get their hands on your baggage, or there is a
   mandatory $3 group baggage fee.  Vegas has killer unions. <p>

OTHER STUFF: <p>

If you check out Wired like 1.5 or 1.6 there was a blurb about the new
Luxor hotel with it's total VR experience.  It looks like the first true VR
ride / experience for a group of people, it seats eight.  Intense.  A friend
was just over there, and tested out the various rides.  Not to be outdone
the new MGM grand (Largest hotel in the world) has a ride called the R360
which is basically a gyroscope they trap you into with goggles.  We should
get a group together and make a mass trek over there and check it out.
If enough people are interested I'll call and see if we can book a time
to reserve space for a bunch of us.  Both are within walking distance. <p>

I'll whip up a list of stuff that's cool to check out in town there so if for
some reason you leave the awesome conference you can take in some unreal
sites in the city of true capitalism. <p>

MEDIA: <p>

Some of the places you can look for information from last year include: <p>

New Media Magazine, September 1993
InfoWorld, 7-12-1993 and also 7-19-1993 by Robert X. Cringely
Gray Areas Magazine, Vol 2, #3 (Fall 1993)
Unix World, ???
Phrack #44 <p>

COST: <p>

Cost is whatever you pay for a hotel room split however many ways, plus
$15 if you preregister, or $30 at the door.  This gets you a nifty 24 bit
color name tag (We're gonna make it niftier this year) and your foot in the
door.  There are fast food places all over, and there is alcohol all over
the place but the trick is to get it during a happy hour for maximum
cheapness. <p>

============================================================================ <p>

UPDATE: <p>

I wanted to thank whoever sent in the anonymous fax to Wired that
was printed in issue 1.5  Cool deal! <p>

Dan Farmer posted his paper on unix security on the net, and I've put a
copy of it on the ftp site if you want to grab it and take a look.  It's
called "zen.txt" <p>

I've recieved more scanned images from last year, and they will be put on
the ftp site. <p>

THE CLIPPER CHIP: A TECHNICAL SUMMARY (by Dorothy) [for cis590] <p>

From: denning@guvax.acc.georgetown.edu
Newsgroups: sci.crypt
Subject: THE CLIPPER CHIP: A TECHNICAL SUMMARY
Date: 19 Apr 93 18:23:27 -0400
Organization: Georgetown University <p>

The following document summarizes the Clipper Chip, how it is used,
how programming of the chip is coupled to key generation and the
escrow process, and how law enforcement decrypts communications.
Since there has been some speculation on this news group about my
own involvement in this project, I'd like to add that I was not in
any way involved.  I found out about it when the FBI briefed me on
Thursday evening, April 15.  Since then I have spent considerable
time talking with the NSA and FBI to learn more about this, and I
attended the NIST briefing at the Department of Commerce on April 16.
The document below is the result of that effort. <p>

THE CLIPPER CHIP: A TECHNICAL SUMMARY <p>

Dorothy Denning <p>

April 19, 1993 <p>

INTRODUCTION <p>

On April 16, the President announced a new initiative that will bring
together the Federal Government and industry in a voluntary program
to provide secure communications while meeting the legitimate needs of
law enforcement.  At the heart of the plan is a new tamper-proof encryption
chip called the "Clipper Chip" together with a split-key approach to
escrowing keys.  Two escrow agencies are used, and the key parts from
both are needed to reconstruct a key. <p>

CHIP STRUCTURE <p>

The Clipper Chip contains a classified 64-bit block encryption
algorithm called "Skipjack."  The algorithm uses 80 bit keys (compared
with 56 for the DES) and has 32 rounds of scrambling (compared with 16
for the DES).  It supports all 4 DES modes of operation.  Throughput is
16 Mbits a second. <p>

Each chip includes the following components: <p>

the Skipjack encryption algorithm
   F, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips
   N, a 30-bit serial number
   U, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip <p>

ENCRYPTING WITH THE CHIP <p>

To see how the chip is used, imagine that it is embedded in the AT&amp;T
telephone security device (as it will be).  Suppose I call someone and
we both have such a device.  After pushing a button to start a secure
conversation, my security device will negotiate a session key K with
the device at the other end (in general, any method of key exchange can
be used).  The key K and message stream M (i.e., digitized voice) are then
fed into the Clipper Chip to produce two values: <p>

E[M; K], the encrypted message stream, and
   E[E[K; U] + N; F], a law enforcement block. <p>

The law enforcement block thus contains the session key K encrypted
under the unit key U concatenated with the serial number N, all
encrypted under the family key F. <p>

CHIP PROGRAMMING AND ESCROW <p>

All Clipper Chips are programmed inside a SCIF (secure computer
information facility), which is essentially a vault.  The SCIF contains
a laptop computer and equipment to program the chips.  About 300 chips
are programmed during a single session.  The SCIF is located at
Mikotronx. <p>

At the beginning of a session, a trusted agent from each of the two key
escrow agencies enters the vault.  Agent 1 enters an 80-bit value S1
into the laptop and agent 2 enters an 80-bit value S2. These values
serve as seeds to generate keys for a sequence of serial numbers. <p>

To generate the unit key for a serial number N, the 30-bit value N is
first padded with a fixed 34-bit block to produce a 64-bit block N1.
S1 and S2 are then used as keys to triple-encrypt N1, producing a
64-bit block R1: <p>

R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1] . <p>

Similarly, N is padded with two other 34-bit blocks to produce N2 and
N3, and two additional 64-bit blocks R2 and R3 are computed: <p>

R2 = E[D[E[N2; S1]; S2]; S1]
        R3 = E[D[E[N3; S1]; S2]; S1] . <p>

R1, R2, and R3 are then concatenated together, giving 192 bits. The
first 80 bits are assigned to U1 and the second 80 bits to U2.  The
rest are discarded.  The unit key U is the XOR of U1 and U2.  U1 and U2
are the key parts that are separately escrowed with the two escrow
agencies. <p>

As a sequence of values for U1, U2, and U are generated, they are
written onto three separate floppy disks.  The first disk contains a
file for each serial number that contains the corresponding key part
U1.  The second disk is similar but contains the U2 values.  The third
disk contains the unit keys U.  Agent 1 takes the first disk and agent
2 takes the second disk.  The third disk is used to program the chips.
After the chips are programmed, all information is discarded from the
vault and the agents leave.  The laptop may be destroyed for additional
assurance that no information is left behind. <p>

The protocol may be changed slightly so that four people are in the
room instead of two.  The first two would provide the seeds S1 and S2,
and the second two (the escrow agents) would take the disks back to
the escrow agencies. <p>

The escrow agencies have as yet to be determined, but they will not
be the NSA, CIA, FBI, or any other law enforcement agency.  One or
both may be independent from the government. <p>

LAW ENFORCEMENT USE <p>

When law enforcement has been authorized to tap an encrypted line, they
will first take the warrant to the service provider in order to get
access to the communications line.  Let us assume that the tap is in
place and that they have determined that the line is encrypted with
Clipper.  They will first decrypt the law enforcement block with the
family key F.  This gives them E[K; U] + N.  They will then take a
warrant identifying the chip serial number N to each of the key escrow
agents and get back U1 and U2.  U1 and U2 are XORed together to produce
the unit key U, and E[K; U] is decrypted to get the session key K.
Finally the message stream is decrypted.  All this will be accomplished
through a special black box decoder operated by the FBI. <p>

ACKNOWLEDGMENT AND DISTRIBUTION NOTICE.  All information is based on
information provided by NSA, NIST, and the FBI.  Permission to
distribute this document is granted. <p>

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY <p>

During the past five years, encryption technology has become easily available
to both individuals and businesses, affording them a level of security
formerly available practically to only military, national security, and law
enforcement agencies. As a result, a debate within the United States about
the proper balance between national security and personal freedom has been
initiated. Law enforcement and national security agencies would like to
maintain tight control over civilian encryption technologies, while industry
and individual and privacy rights advocates fight to expand their ability to
distribute and use cryptographic products as they please. <p>

This report analyzes trends in encryption technology, markets, export
controls, and legislation.  It identifies five trends which will have a
strong influence on cryptography policy in the United States: <p>

* The continued expansion of the Internet and the progressive
     miniaturization of cryptographic hardware combined with the  increasing
     availability and use of strong cryptographic software means that the
     strongest encryption technologies will  continue to become more easily
     obtainable everywhere in the years ahead. <p>

* Additional growth in networked and wireless communication will fuel a
     strong demand for encryption hardware and software both domestically and
     abroad, causing the U. S. high-technology industry to be increasingly
     interested in selling encryption products overseas and in modifying
     current export restrictions. <p>

* Due to the responsibilities and bureaucratic dispositions of key
     Executive Branch agencies, products using strong encryption algorithms
     such as DES will continue to face at least some export  restrictions,
     despite the widespread availability of strong encryption products
     overseas. <p>

* The American public is likely to become increasingly concerned about
     its privacy and about cryptographic policy as a result of the increased
     amount of personal information available online and the growing number
     of wireless and networked communications.  The development and
     increasingly widespread use of the National Information Infrastructure
     will heighten these concerns. <p>

* Encryption policy is becoming an important public policy issue that
     will engage the attention of all branches of government.  Congress will
     become increasingly visible in this debate due to its power of agency
     oversight and its role in passing laws accommodating the United States'
     rapid rate of technological change.  Agencies will remain very important
     since they have the implementing and, often, the planning
     responsibilities.  Since individuals and industry have more direct
     influence over Congress than over most other branches of government,
     Congress may place somewhat more emphasis on personal freedom than many
     other government actors. <p>

Four potential scenarios are likely: mandatory escrowed encryption, voluntary
escrowed encryption, complete decontrol of encryption, or domestic decontrol

Actually, I did see a surprise at this level. <p>

&gt; Four potential scenarios are likely: mandatory escrowed encryption, voluntary
&gt; escrowed encryption, complete decontrol of encryption, or domestic decontrol
&gt; with strict export regulations. <p>

In the U.S., domestic use of cryptography is not controlled.  It
hasn't been controlled, and there's been absolutely no discussion of
imposing controls, except, of course, as a hypothetical idea needed to
make sense of the Clipper proposal.  ("If there's no prohibition of
non-Clipper cryptography, how can Clipper be successful?") <p>

Mandatory escrowed encryption is unlikely but hypothetically possible. <p>

"Domestic decontrol" is not a potential scenario because there's no
control in place now. <p>

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY <p>

During the past five years, encryption technology has become easily available
to both individuals and businesses, affording them a level of security
formerly available practically to only military, national security, and law
enforcement agencies. As a result, a debate within the United States about
the proper balance between national security and personal freedom has been
initiated. Law enforcement and national security agencies would like to
maintain tight control over civilian encryption technologies, while industry
and individual and privacy rights advocates fight to expand their ability to
distribute and use cryptographic products as they please. <p>

This report analyzes trends in encryption technology, markets, export
controls, and legislation.  It identifies five trends which will have a
strong influence on cryptography policy in the United States: <p>

* The continued expansion of the Internet and the progressive
     miniaturization of cryptographic hardware combined with the  increasing
     availability and use of strong cryptographic software means that the
     strongest encryption technologies will  continue to become more easily
     obtainable everywhere in the years ahead. <p>

* Additional growth in networked and wireless communication will fuel a
     strong demand for encryption hardware and software both domestically and
     abroad, causing the U. S. high-technology industry to be increasingly
     interested in selling encryption products overseas and in modifying
     current export restrictions. <p>

* Due to the responsibilities and bureaucratic dispositions of key
     Executive Branch agencies, products using strong encryption algorithms
     such as DES will continue to face at least some export  restrictions,
     despite the widespread availability of strong encryption products
     overseas. <p>

* The American public is likely to become increasingly concerned about
     its privacy and about cryptographic policy as a result of the increased
     amount of personal information available online and the growing number
     of wireless and networked communications.  The development and
     increasingly widespread use of the National Information Infrastructure
     will heighten these concerns. <p>

* Encryption policy is becoming an important public policy issue that
     will engage the attention of all branches of government.  Congress will
     become increasingly visible in this debate due to its power of agency
     oversight and its role in passing laws accommodating the United States'
     rapid rate of technological change.  Agencies will remain very important
     since they have the implementing and, often, the planning
     responsibilities.  Since individuals and industry have more direct
     influence over Congress than over most other branches of government,
     Congress may place somewhat more emphasis on personal freedom than many
     other government actors. <p>

Four potential scenarios are likely: mandatory escrowed encryption, voluntary
escrowed encryption, complete decontrol of encryption, or domestic decontrol
with strict export regulations. <p>

1.  INTRODUCTION <p>

During the past five years, encryption technology has become easily available
to both individuals and businesses, affording them a level of security
formerly available practically to only military, national security, and law
enforcement agencies.  This availability and the desirability of encrypting
some communications is just starting to be generally recognized by American
business, and the encryption market is just now beginning to emerge as a
significant part of the computer security market.  As a result, a debate
within the United States about the proper balance of national security, law
enforcement, and personal freedom has been initiated.  Law enforcement and
national security agencies would like to maintain tight control over civilian
encryption technologies, while industry and individual and privacy rights
advocates fight to expand their ability to distribute and use cryptographic
products as they please.1 <p>

This report analyzes trends in encryption technology and policy against this
backdrop.  It is one in a trilogy of research papers being prepared under the
direction of Professor James Chandler of the George Washington University
National Law Center and Professor Lance Hoffman of the George Washington
University School of Engineering and Applied Science, Department of
Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.  The papers cover the following
topics: <p>

Issues Regarding the Use of Cryptographic Technologies in the Commercial
     Sector.  Review and analysis of U.S. laws, regulations, and case law
     pertaining to the use of commercial encryption products for voice and
     data communications between private parties located within continental
     U.S. boundaries and with parties in foreign jurisdictions, including
     examination of all applicable Federal statutes, regulations, executive
     orders, and other publicly available sources of legally binding
     directives.  Laws or regulations which have been interpreted as
     mandating the use of cryptographic systems are also included. 2 <p>

Foreign Encryption Technology Controls.  Identification and analysis of
     foreign laws and regulations pertaining to the use and control of
     commercial encryption products for voice and data communications. 3 <p>

Cryptography: Trends in Technology and Policy (this paper).
     Encapsulation of current legislation and analysis of trends based on the
     above papers with future implications for encryption technology and the
     use of commercial encryption products. <p>

This report is divided into four primary sections: <p>

* Technology:  future trends in high technology and, more specifically,
     encryption technology. <p>

* Market Analysis:  trends in the global market for encryption products,
     especially DES- and RSA-based products. <p>

* Export Controls: trends that may influence the wording and
     implementation of laws restricting export of encryption products
     manufactured in the United States. <p>

* Public Policy Issues: factors and trends that may determine the future
     direction of policy decisions and legislation related to cryptography in
     the United States. <p>

After discussions of these topics, four potential scenarios are briefly
presented as possibilities. <p>

Suchinsky, and others.  Conclusions or opinions in this paper are, however,

other persons. <p>

2.  TECHNOLOGY <p>

Commercial encryption technology has evolved since the popular 'Data
Encryption Standard' (DES)4 was released to the public in 1977 and will
continue to do so during the foreseeable future.  From a situation then when
only private key systems were generally in use, public key systems have
become increasingly popular, especially for authentication.  Detailed reviews
of the evolution of cryptography over the last sixteen years or so can be
found in [5] and [6].   In particular, hardware encryption devices will
become smaller, users will use signatures and digests (typically public key
systems7, 8 as well as private key systems), and encryption algorithms will
become increasingly powerful.9 <p>

A cryptographic system generally provides for two functions:  encryption and
decryption.  The encryption function converts data from 'plaintext,' or
normal text, into 'ciphertext,' which is incomprehensible to the casual
observer.  The decryption function reverses this process, restoring the data
to its original form.  In order to perform either of these functions (i.e. to
send or receive an encrypted message), the system's user must have a unique
'key,' a sequence of bits.  This key is input to the algorithm to
successfully perform the desired conversion.  The strength of an encryption
scheme is dependent both upon the strength of its algorithm and, often, on
the length of the keys used for encryption and decryption.  Longer key
lengths mean more possible keys for an intruder to try and thus imply greater
security.  Encryption and decryption are generally performed by a computer
with the assistance of hardware and/or software cryptographic products. <p>

A trend in encryption products, concurrent with the same trend in computer
technology in general, is towards increasing miniaturization.  For example,
in 1988 the primary encryption device manufactured by AT&amp;T weighed seventeen
pounds.  Now, with the advent of PCMCIA (Personal Computer Memory Card
Industry Association) technology, it is widely anticipated that one or more
manufacturers will soon release encryption-capable modems the size of a
credit card. <p>

Some observers feel a trend is developing from hardware or software/hardware
products to software-only products9, 10  because software is cheaper, easier to
install and use, and takes up less space on a computer than hardware.  Others
disagree, thinking that the future of encryption technology may be in
hardware-based products, because they are faster, harder to compromise, and
also take up very little space now because of developments in VLSI (Very
Large Scale Integrated) chip design .11 <p>

There is also a growing use of 'public-key' cryptography systems.9, 13  Under
a more traditional single key system, the same key is used both for
encrypting and decrypting the message.  Although this is reasonably secure,
there is a risk that this key will be intercepted when the parties involved
exchange keys.  A public key system, however, does not necessitate the
exchange of a secret key in the transmission of messages.  The sender
encrypts the message with the recipient's freely-disclosed, unique public
key.  The recipient, in turn, uses her unique private key to decrypt the
message.7  It is also possible to encrypt messages with the sender's private
key, allowing anyone who knows the sender's public key to decrypt the
message.  This process is crucial to creating digital signatures, as
discussed later. <p>

Coincident with the increase in electronic communications is the need to
write one's own signature on both business and personal transactions.  At the
moment, writing one's own signature requires written messages.  Now, however,
electronic communications have become so heavily used that many business and
personal transactions will flourish between parties who never actually see
each other and physically sign no paper; increasingly, digital signatures
will be used to provide message authentication. <p>

Public-key cryptography also enables the user to produce a digital signature
by encrypting with her private key, which, when decrypted with her public
key, provides verification that the message originated from that user.
Possible applications for this technology include online financial
transactions and business negotiations. <p>

The DES (Data Encryption Standard) and RSA (named after its inventors Rivest,
Shamir, and Adelman) algorithms are generally considered two of the strongest
algorithms on the market.  DES is a strong, private-key algorithm developed
by IBM and made a standard by the United States government in the late
1970's.  RSA, in turn, is the most popular public-key algorithm.14  It is
based on prime number generation, using the fact that it is very difficult to
factor the product of two large prime numbers. Encryption hardware and
software products incorporating DES and RSA are widely available both
domestically and abroad.  Over two million instantiations of RSA have been
distributed in the United States, in almost every case seamlessly embedded by
the vendor.  By the end of 1994, this number will rise to five million and by
the end of 1995, it will double.15 <p>

PGP (Pretty Good Privacy), 16 which originally incorporated RSA, employs
public-key cryptography and puts together strong algorithms for both
authentication and message transmission.  It now uses a combination of the
IDEA (International Data Encryption Algorithm)17 and DES algorithms, is free,
and can be obtained over the Internet via anonymous FTP ("file transfer
protocol"). <p>

DES continues to be an important standard for encrypting data, particularly
within the U. S. and foreign financial communities.  The National Institutes
for Standard and Technology (NIST) is in the process of recertifying DES as
a national standard for the next five years.  However, the security of DES in
the future is worrisome to some scientists, who contend that advances in
technology will soon make it possible to break DES by 'brute force,' using a
powerful computer to try every possible combination of keys until the correct
key is discovered.  Indeed, in ten years, DES may no longer be secure.18 <p>

In contrast, SKIPJACK, the classified encryption/decryption algorithm used in
the White House's key escrow ('Clipper') initiative, utilizes an 80-bit key,
24 bits longer than the 56-bit key used in DES.  The interim report of the
SKIPJACK evaluators chosen by NSA and NIST came to three conclusions:19 <p>

1.   Under an assumption that the cost of processing power is halved
          every eighteen months, it will be 36 years before the cost of
          breaking SKIPJACK by exhaustive search will be equal to the cost of
          breaking DES today.  Thus, there is no significant risk that
          SKIPJACK will be broken by exhaustive search in the next 30-40
          years. <p>

2.   There is no significant risk that SKIPJACK can be broken through a
          shortcut method of attack. <p>

3.   While the internal structure of SKIPJACK must be classified in
          order to protect law enforcement and national security objectives,
          the strength of SKIPJACK against a cryptanalytic attack does not
          depend on the secrecy of the algorithm. <p>

Other sources report that many industry representatives believe that
processing power doubles about every six months to a year.  This would reduce
the "safe time" of the first point above to approximately 12-18 years, rather
than 30-40 years. <p>

Other escrow schemes are also available.  Micali20 has proposed a multikey
escrow capability in which multiple trusted parties authenticate a message
and/or allow eavesdropping.  In a recent unpublished paper, Desmedt, Frankel,
and Yung state that threshold cryptosystems (as presented at recent Crypto,
Asiacrypt, and Eurocrypt conferences) can have the same functionality as key
escrow schemes without relying on "(expensive) tamperproof devices."21 <p>

The increasing use and availability of encryption technology logically
accompanies the exponential increase in electronic communications over the
past few years.  Commercial use of the Internet has increased dramatically
during the past two years, and noncommercial use is on the rise as well.22
Indeed, as the New York Times whimsically notes, "Forget Elaine's.  Internet
is currently the world's most fashionable rendezvous."  It touches down in
137 countries and links 15 million to 30 million people and is growing by a
million users each month.23 <p>

This growth in the popularity of the Internet has created a demand for
security.  Electronic mail users who desire confidentiality and sender
authentication increasingly are demanding encryption.  Some are already using
PGP.  Others are starting to use Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM), an Internet
encryption mechanism which was funded by the Advanced Research Projects
Agency of the Defense Department and has recently been introduced as a
commercial product by Trusted Information Systems, Inc.  It uses the DES
algorithm for encryption and the RSA algorithm for sender authentication and
key management. Privacy Enhanced Mail also provides support for
nonrepudiation; this allows the third-party recipient of a forwarded message
to verify the identity of the message originator (not just the message
forwarder) and to verify if any of the original text has been altered.24, 25
Although PEM is not yet widespread, a number of vendors are offering it in
conjunction with or integrated into their commercial electronic mail
applications and the European Community has adopted PEM for its PASSWORD
project26  which is part of an attempt to establish a pilot security
infrastructure for network applications for the European research community.
Ironically, a Federally funded chip, Clipper, now is being pushed as a
substitute for this mechanism which has already been paid for largely by
government funds and is already in place. <p>

The increasing number of electronic funds transfers (EFTs) between banks has
necessitated the increasing use of message authentication systems, to
determine if a message has originated from its proper source and to determine
if there have been any modifications.27  One institution alone, the Clearing
House Interbank Payment System, currently moves an average of one trillion
dollars each day via wire and satellite.28   Strong encryption is necessary to
provide security and authentication for these electronic money transfers (and
is also why export restrictions on the DES algorithm have been relaxed for
financial institutions). <p>

Despite these leaps in technology, telefacsimile (fax) transmissions are not
yet widely encrypted, even though fax is a widely used form of data
communications.  According to a Datapro 1993 report27,  there are only 11
encryption devices which accommodate FAX transmissions.  It is inconvenient
to equip both the sending and receiving machine with compatible encryption
before facsimile transmission; the fax protocol has no convenient place for
inserting non-fax functions such as encryption; and, until recently, there
has been little awareness of security threats among fax users.  However,
increasing use of fax transmissions by businesses who wish to keep their
corporate information and finances confidential and an increasing awareness
of the security problems will require the availability of more products which
encrypt fax communications. <p>

Credit cards and ATMs are the forerunners of what may soon become 'digital
cash.'  On the average, people use less pocket cash every year. Indeed,
credit-card purchases are now used for one-tenth of all consumer payments.29
David Chaum, head of the Cryptography Group at the Center for Mathematics and
Computer Science (CWI) in Amsterdam, has proposed a distributed smart card
system which, using public key cryptography, allows anonymous cash embodied
by the cards to be used like real money.28 This is another consequence of the
increasing digitization of financial transactions: 'Ubiquitous digital cash
dovetails well with massive electronics networks.  It's a pretty sound bet
the Internet-today's version of the Net-will be the first place that e-money
will infiltrate deeply.' 29 <p>

One of the consequences of an increasingly electronics-oriented economy will
be the need to provide some amount of anonymity and privacy for users of such
a digital cash system in order to ensure that electronic money remains
anonymous and untraceable, except by the payer and payee.  Government
approval will be requisite for digital cash to gain full approval by the
business community and public, and the government may require access to these
transaction records to prevent what might otherwise become "perfect crimes."
30 <p>

In conclusion, the current trends in encryption technology include increasing
miniaturization, increasing use of public and private-key cryptography, and
the continued development of increasingly secure algorithms.  These trends
are all coincident with the skyrocketing use of the Internet and other types
of electronic communications, particularly electronic money communications. <p>

3.  MARKET ANALYSIS <p>

The market for encryption products is rapidly growing.27 This market trend is
concomitant with the increasing use of personal computers, fax machines, and
e-mail for electronic communications.  A large encryption market has also
arisen because of wireless communications, such as cellular telephones. There
are already 12 million subscribers to cellular telephone services in the
United States, and the trend is toward more wireless communications in the
future.  Since they are easier to intercept than wire-based ones, the demand
for encryption technology will increase as concern for data integrity
increases.9 <p>

This growth in the market for encryption is occurring both in the United
States and abroad.  According to International Resource Development, the U.
S. data encryption market reached an estimated $384 million in 1991, and will
jump to $946 million by 1996.  The total worldwide market, estimated at $695
million in 1991, is predicted to grow at a similar rate, reaching $1.8
billion by 1996.31 <p>

The encryption market is no longer left to United States companies to
dominate.  A Software Publishers Association (SPA) survey shows 264 foreign
encryption products and 288 domestic products.  These findings contrast
sharply with the large global market shares (approximately 75%) enjoyed by
United States software publishers and hardware manufacturers in other areas.32
Of the 264 foreign products, 123 products use DES.36 <p>

Citing the relatively stringent export controls enforced by the United States
government as being one of the main reasons for the increasing market share
of foreign cryptographic products in the global market, many manufacturers
are currently lobbying the government to relax these export controls in an
effort to keep United States technology competitive abroad.  The SPA claims
that most software and hardware vendors, aware of these export controls,
decide not to manufacture encryption technology because they realize that
their very best technology cannot be exported.  Thus, they claim, there are
far fewer domestic vendors than would otherwise exist.10 <p>

Many commentators have speculated on the influence of the escrow encryption
standard (Clipper) on the global market.  Georgetown University Professor
Dorothy Denning, one of the evaluators of the SKIPJACK algorithm used in the
proposed key-escrow arrangement and an advocate of its deployment, states
that if the technology provided by Clipper catches on, it could become the de
facto standard in the United States, either the only device or the
predominant device available on the market.33 <p>

Marc Rotenberg, director of the Washington office of Computer Professionals
for Social Responsibility (CPSR), believes that the government would be able
to wield considerable clout in making the key-escrow arrangement a de facto
standard on the market.13   He explains that the government can exert enormous
authority on creating, developing, and enforcing technical standards through
the procurement process.  Through this procurement process, the government
can require any manufacturer selling phones to the government or government
contractors to install the key-escrow arrangement in their phones.  AT&amp;T
supplies an enormous amount of telecommunications services and equipment to
the government, thus making the government one of AT&amp;T's largest customers.
In response to the Presidentially approved Clipper initiative, AT&amp;T has
started incorporating the key-escrow arrangement in some of its phones, a
powerful illustration of the enormous spending power of the government. <p>

However, the Federal government does not represent a large percentage of the
market or the revenue for all American companies providing communications or
computer technology.  For example, Bill Ferguson of Semaphore Communications
Corp. states that government purchases are less than one percent of
Semaphore's global sales potential.  With trade restrictions applied, the
government still supplies less than five percent of Semaphore's expected
sales.34   Companies such as Semaphore and many represented by the SPA see
foreign markets as potentially larger sources of income than the U. S.
government and therefore want trade restrictions relaxed so that more market
opportunities can open up.  As it stands now, many in the encryption industry
fear that products using the Clipper chip will be effectively unexportable
due to United States government retention of the keys.35,36 <p>

The Clinton administration has stated that use of a key escrow system will
not be mandatory ("The Administration has progressed far enough in its review
to conclude it will not propose new legislation to limit use of encryption
technology.")37.  However, if this decision were reversed (perhaps by a later
administration), there is some danger that the proposed key-escrow
arrangement could function as a 'Digital Volstead Act,' the 1920's
prohibition on alcohol.  Like Prohibition and the organized crime that
resulted from it, the key-escrow arrangement could encourage contempt for law
enforcement and a complete disregard of the law.35  Doug Miller of the SPA
feels that a black market would almost certainly arise if the United States
government makes some standard mandatory.10 <p>

Given the increased use of computers and networks, a steady increase in the
market for encryption products is likely, as is a continued expansion into
this market by foreign manufacturers.  United States hardware and software
producers, stymied by relatively stringent export restrictions imposed by the
United States government and possibly further hindered by the necessity of
accommodating what may be an unexportable Clipper standard, may find it even
more difficult to remain competitive players in international markets. <p>

4.  EXPORT CONTROLS <p>

Existing controls on the export of encryption software and hardware has been
a topic of concern for United States manufacturers and vendors. Despite a
February 1991 COCOM decision to decontrol all mass market software, including
encryption software, as other commercial, dual-use items, United States
export control policy continues to categorize many encryption items as
'munitions-related', thereby subjecting them to applicable export laws.38
Anyone wishing to export the strongest encryption products is therefore
required, under the Arms Export Control Act, to obtain individual licenses
from the Office of Defense Trade Controls at the State Department (though
some products of lesser strength are under the control of the Commerce
Department).39  This has led to a prohibition on export of encryption products
using the popular and relatively powerful DES algorithm for file and data
encryption (except for financial applications and use by subsidiaries of U.
S. companies abroad). <p>

Obtaining a license for these restricted encryption products includes a
review of the product by the National Security Agency (NSA) to determine its
exportability.  According to Allan Suchinsky, Chief of Electronic and Combat
Systems Licensing at the Office of Defense Trade Controls at the Department
of State, this process normally takes between one and six weeks.40  According
to some officials and business people, however, a newly developed encryption
product can actually take up to ten months to go through the review process,
although products employing certain algorithms are either on a list of
automatically approved items or eligible for 'fast track' consideration. In
the high-tech arena where product cycles are often measured in months, large
market shares can be lost due to such delays.  Some industry representatives
have complained that the average time it takes to obtain a similar license
for encryption products outside the United States is much less.34 <p>

The market analysis above describes the steadily growing global market for
strong encryption products, one that is potentially worth millions (if not
billions) of dollars. But United States manufacturers believe that their
hands are tied by stringent export laws which, for 'national security'
reasons, prohibit the export of encryption products of DES strength or
stronger to anyone other than financial institutions.  They also believe that
foreign manufacturers in Europe and elsewhere are not similarly restricted,
and are free to manufacture and export DES- and RSA-based products. This
asymmetry in export laws has undesirable consequences for United States
manufacturers of encryption products. <p>

DES-based products are already being used in encryption products manufactured
in foreign countries including Japan, Russia, Germany, France, Austria, UK,
Switzerland, Netherlands, Austria, Australia and Sweden.32  The DES algorithm,
in fact, is also freely obtainable via the Internet, as is DES-based
encryption software. The encryption 'genie'  would appear to be out of the
bottle, and at this point it is not clear to United States companies  why the
State Department is inhibiting the wide proliferation of DES technology,41 now
that it is not in a position to prevent it. Along with this, one must
consider the trends towards implementation of encryption products in
software, and the miniaturization of encryption hardware. Taken together,
these trends indicate that it will become increasingly difficult to enforce
the existing export laws, and tougher to prevent the spread of DES-caliber
algorithms.  Despite this, many government officials have continued to speak
strongly in favor of continued restrictions on DES, stating that attempting
to control export of products using the algorithm still prevents a
significant number of international terrorists, criminals, and unfriendly
foreign powers from acquiring advanced encryption technology.  As a result,
they believe that export restrictions on DES remain in the United States'
best interest, even if they may not always be fully effective.40 <p>

The current export restrictions have a detrimental effect on many U.S.
companies.  According to Addison Fischer of Fischer International, "export
controls are estimated to have cost Fischer International millions of dollars
in lost revenue for cryptographic products"42  due to rejection by foreign
customers of the weaker encryption products United States companies are
forced to supply, lost sales opportunities, and delays with paperwork
necessary for obtaining the appropriate licenses.  And since DES is already
easily available overseas, Fischer feels that existing export restrictions
are simply placing an embargo on United States DES-based products. Similar
complaints have been voiced by other United States companies.  The Computer
Systems Security and Privacy Advisory Board agrees that "current controls are
negatively impacting U. S. competitiveness in the world market and are not
inhibiting the foreign production and use of cryptography [DES and RSA]." 43 <p>

Thus, if the United States government continues to control DES-strength
encryption manufactured in the U.S., the following results may come to pass: <p>

* Foreign competitors of United States encryption companies will likely
     gain control of the global market for encryption products. <p>

* United States companies will lose significant market share in the
     global market for encryption products. They are likely to lose sales
     opportunities as they compete in the electronic security market against
     products based on DES and RSA with their own weaker versions based on
     RC2 and RC4. <p>

* DES strength encryption will continue to proliferate to foreign
     destinations, either through foreign companies or through the
     ever-growing Internet. The effort of current United States export policy
     to inhibit this by restricting exports on DES-based technology is
     unlikely to succeed. <p>

* If, indeed, United States companies get displaced in the international
     encryption marketplace, United States 'national security' will also be
     threatened by a weakened domestic encryption (and computer) industry. <p>

In July 1992, the Software Publishers Association reached an agreement with
the Bush Administration that would permit an expedited 7-day review process
for products based on RC2 and RC4 algorithms.  These algorithms are still
much weaker than DES; but they are also stronger than any other algorithms
which were exportable prior to this agreement.  This was an important
development in the effort to decontrol the export of encryption products from
the United States.  Projecting forward from this milestone, it is likely that
as the private sector continues to push for further relaxation of these
controls, more and stronger encryption products will be put on similar
'autolists' for automatic export approval. <p>

The Federal government seeks to encourage the use of key escrow systems for
encrypting telecommunications.44  The standard proposed for these systems, the
"Clipper" escrowed encryption standard,45  is particularly noteworthy in light
of the fact that law enforcement officials, with a court order, can obtain
both parts of a special key that enables them to decrypt transmissions
encrypted with a particular chip.  At the time of this writing, how Clipper
will be treated for export purposes is not clear.  If it is treated the same
way as DES, it will certainly provide another example of the Byzantine nature
of U. S. export policy.  In any case, it is likely that foreign customers
will reject these products, due to fears of both United States tampering and
the possible existence of a secret 'trap door,' which would enable
unauthorized parties to decrypt Clipper-encrypted transmissions, even without
the escrowed parts of the special key.  Chris Sundt of the multinational
International Computers Ltd. (ICL) claims this very fear will be the basis of
rejecting Clipper as an encryption alternative in international markets.46
Other United States based companies share his concern that the key escrow
chip is effectively unexportable.47 <p>

In spite of the concerns described above, it appears unlikely that United
States export laws will become as relaxed as those in many European
countries.  DES-based products for file and data encryption will probably not
be removed from the munitions list in the near future.  Almost everyone
interviewed for this report felt that NSA will continue to play an
increasingly dominant role in the debate over cryptography in the U.S., and
will continue to have influence much stronger than NIST's on encryption
policy issues.  NSA will continue to strongly voice its opinions to the
President and pressure him to keep DES-based encryption on the munitions list
and under the jurisdiction of the Department of State. <p>

5.  PUBLIC POLICY ISSUES <p>

5.1  EXECUTIVE BRANCH <p>

Due to the increasing public availability of strong hardware- and
software-based encryption products, a debate over their regulation and use is
emerging.48   The debate over Clipper and regulation of other encryption
technologies is, in many ways, the continuation of an ongoing discussion in
the United States about the proper balance between national security and
individual freedom of action.  On one side of the debate are those agencies
charged with defending America from crime, terrorism, and external threat,
such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the National Security
Agency (NSA), the Central Intelligence Agency, the Department of State, and
the Department of Justice.  These powerful agencies, in turn, are challenged
by advocacy groups and high-technology industries, which place a greater
emphasis on individual rights, in particular personal privacy, or corporate
profits.  The United States Congress may play a major role in determining the
balance between the two. <p>

There are several powerful agencies which are leading the Administration's
effort to control encryption technology.  First and foremost among these is
the National Security Agency, which for years was the sole controller of
strong encryption in the United States.  NSA has two primary goals on its
agenda.  The most overt one is the protection of United States national
security, which the NSA does largely with the help of signal intelligence.49
If terrorists of foreign agents were to obtain and use strong encryption
hardware or software, NSA's efforts to learn about and thwart their
activities would be considerably more difficult.  Indeed, as Marc Rotenberg
of Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility comments, the continued
development of encryption technologies poses one of the most significant
challenges the agency has faced during the post-Cold War era.13 <p>

Less obvious but also important is NSA's effort to protect its preeminent
role in civilian cryptography.  For years, NSA had almost complete control
over developments in the encryption field.  In recent years, however, this
control has begun to erode as private firms and individuals have begun
aggressively developing and using encryption technologies.  The end of the
Cold War and the assignment of responsibility by the Computer Security Act of
1987 50 for development of federal unclassified computer security standards
(including cryptography standards) to NIST has threatened many aspects of
NSA's traditional role.  Doug Miller of the Software Publishers Association
observed that 'NSA throughout its existence . . . has had every incentive to
delay the inevitable' (individuals obtaining full control of their own
cryptography).10 <p>

The FBI is primarily concerned with investigating serious crimes and
thwarting domestic terrorism.  In a small number of important cases, such as
those involving drug trafficking, organized crime, or terrorism, the FBI
gathers information via wiretaps.  Indeed, wiretaps have been used in to
gather evidence in 90% of terrorism cases brought to trial.51  However, the
FBI has not been able to point to a single case to date where encryption has
hampered their investigation of a case. <p>

Several developments, however, are making these wiretaps progressively more
difficult to conduct.  Two of these are the increasing complexity of the
United States telecommunications infrastructure and the gradual replacement
of copper wires by fiber optics, which can carry thousands of conversations
in a single strand of fiber.  Both of these changes make it more difficult
for agents, even with phone companies' help, to isolate individual
conversations.49   In addition, the development of publicly available
encryption threatens to delay or prevent the FBI's ability to utilize the
contents of these wiretaps.  This poses serious risks to the lives and safety
of the American people whom the FBI is charged to protect, especially in
cases where the Bureau is relying on real-time interception of phone calls to
protect citizens from harm or to apprehend a suspect.52 <p>

Most of the other executive agencies and departments involved in the
regulation of encryption technology have similar agendas:  protecting
American citizens from harm and defending their areas of responsibility and
influence within the government.49 <p>

There are Constitutional issues related to encryption controls, and the
Clinton administration recognized this when it announced the Clipper
initiative.44  Its later review has so far found no impinging on Americans'
Constitutional rights.37   Our colleagues at the GW National Law Center
basically agree.2,3  Other lawyers have differing points of view.53, 54 <p>

Professor James Chandler of the George Washington University National Law
Center observes that some United States industries and proponents of
individual rights tend to place a stronger emphasis on freedom of action than
national security and thus oppose stringent limitations on encryption
technology.55   The software publishing community and vendors of
hardware-based encryption devices have generally focused their opposition on
current United States export restrictions, which cost them millions of
dollars annually.11  Making a somewhat different argument, individual rights
advocacy groups such as Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility
(CPSR) and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) assert that government
is too often intrusive in people's lives and needs to be restrained in this
domain.  As a result, they tend to oppose any policy initiative which would
increase the ability of the government to monitor activities of persons.55 <p>

5.2  CONGRESS <p>

Congress, with its power to make laws and oversee the activities of federal
agencies, can be a significant factor in this ongoing debate.  While the
players named so far have their own, narrowly defined agendas, Congress'
actions are more likely to pay closer attention to the will of the American
people, on whose vote and support their jobs depend.  Indeed, this dynamic
has already been demonstrated. <p>

In 1991, the FBI sponsored the Digital Telephony Proposal, which required
telecommunications equipment manufacturers and service providers to make sure
that their products had a built-in means whereby law enforcement officials
could successfully tap into any conversation provided they obtained a
warrant.1  This initiative was undertaken by the FBI in response to increasing
fear that with the advent of digital phone lines, fiber optics, and advanced
telephony in general, law enforcement might no longer be able to conduct
wiretaps in the near future.  Unfortunately for the FBI, the Digital
Telephony Proposal angered a large number of voters and telecommunications
equipment manufacturers, who in turn put pressure on their congressmen.10  As
a result, the proposal was never allowed to reach the House floor. <p>

Congress has very recently mandated a comprehensive study of cryptography
technology and national cryptography policy by the National Academy of
Sciences.56   Opponents pointed out that this proposal, while in some ways
meritorious, might also have the effect of preserving the status quo for
several years, even though the status quo was characterized by some as early
as 1981 as needing to be "realigned to promote both national security,
broadly defined, and encourage private-sector competence in designing and
applying secure systems."57  The study will start up in  late 1993 or early
1994. <p>

Marc Rotenberg of CPSR observed that the FBI and NSA have learned from the
fate of the Digital Telephony Proposal and have attempted to avoid
Congressional intervention with the Clipper initiative by going through the
White House instead of Congress.   Barring such intervention at this point,
he feels the administration will likely face only limited opposition within
the Administration to the Clipper initiative.13  Thus, any slowdown of this
initiative is more likely to materialize, if it does at all, in Congress.  As
more people perform an increasing number and range of transactions over
electronic networks, they are becoming increasingly concerned about the
integrity of their personal information and about maintaining their privacy.
Of those interviewed in a Macworld poll released July 1993,58 78% expressed
concerns about their personal privacy (up from 64% in 1978) and 68% felt
their privacy was threatened by computers (up from 38% in 1974).  Other
independent surveys confirm this trend.59  While many of the survey results
relate specifically to databases, often in specific sectors such as credit
reporting, computer systems as a whole, including those with insecure
communication lines, are coming under increasing scrutiny.  Congress will be
placed under escalating pressure to pass new laws governing information
technology, especially with the increased attention being devoted to the
design and development of the National Information Infrastructure.60 <p>

Congress' decisions in this area and indeed the outcomes of the debate over
encryption policy in general will be the result of the ongoing struggle in
American society among government, individuals, and industries.  Although
this struggle will likely result in oscillations in policy, national security
may be gradually redefined in terms of economic security.  This is the
expectation of Professor James Chandler,55  who anticipates that controls on
the export of encryption hardware and software will eventually be lifted. <p>

There are already some signs that Congress may be willing to ease
restrictions on the export of encryption products and perhaps in other
encryption-related areas as well.  In early 1991, the Software Publishers
Association suggested an amendment to the renewal of the Export
Administration Act that would have transferred authority over software
exports to the Commerce Department.  This amendment, the Levine Amendment,
was accepted by the House Foreign Affairs Committee, prompting aggressive
lobbying by the National Security Agency of key congressmen in order to
prevent inclusion of this amendment in the reauthorization bill.  Despite
this lobbying, the full House kept the amendment in the Export Administration
Act reauthorization.61  NSA later succeeded in persuading President George
Bush to promise a veto of any reauthorization bill which included the Levine
Amendment or similar provisions, but this incident does demonstrate Congress'
more liberal stance on encryption export regulation.  And, of course, there
is a different administration now in power.  H. R. 3627, introduced in the
closing days of Congress' 1993 session,62 effectively does the same thing, and
it is conceivable that it will pass in 1994. <p>

5.3  TRENDS <p>

To summarize public policy trends, <p>

* Due to their strong emphasis on national security and fighting crime,
     the FBI and the NSA will continue to advocate restraints on encryption
     technology and encourage the development of encryption devices and
     telecommunications systems which allow the government to continue
     conducting wiretaps. <p>

* The National Security Agency is likely to continue protecting its
     'turf' by advocating continued restrictions on encryption technology.
     It may attempt to expand its domain within the government, most likely
     at the expense of NIST. <p>

* As part of its efforts to reassert its control over encryption
     technology, the NSA will likely continue to favor closed forums where it
     can present sensitive, classified material which may not have been
     obtained had U. S. enemies been able to obtain effective encryption.
     These forums such as the National Security Council, will be favored by
     them over open ones.  The agency will continue its effort to keep
     relevant decisions out of the hands of Congress. <p>

* Many high-technology industries, particularly software publishing,
     will place increasing pressure on the government to liberalize
     restrictions on the use and export of encryption software and hardware. <p>

* Since the encryption policy issue has now been politicized63,  any
     action taken to reverse the Clinton administration's progress on the
     Clipper initiative or the current system of export controls will involve
     Congress as well as the executive branch.  The judicial branch (notably
     the Supreme Court) has not had occasion to rule on the issues
     surrounding the debate. <p>

6.  POTENTIAL SCENARIOS <p>

If and when a new cryptography policy emerges, there will be winners and
losers among the pool of 'players,' a pool that roughly consists of law
enforcement agencies, United States manufacturers and vendors of encryption
products, and the United States public. Based on the results of the preceding
analysis, four scenarios can be envisioned. <p>

1. Complete decontrol of cryptography.  The use of strong encryption by
     the United States public, as well as its export by United States
     manufacturers, could be completely decontrolled by the government at the
     direct expense of law enforcement and national security.  This would
     please some members of the public, for they would have maintained
     control over their privacy. United States manufacturers of encryption
     products would also likely benefit from this move. <p>

2. Domestic decontrol of cryptography with export regulations.  Strong
     encryption could remain decontrolled for use by the general public, but
     strict regulations would remain on its export. While the American public
     would still be relatively content, United States industries would lose
     sales and potential market share due to exclusion from the lucrative
     international market for encryption products.  The large domestic
     market, however, would remain open, guaranteeing some revenues for
     encryption product manufacturers.  Law enforcement agencies, on the
     other hand, would lose in the short term in either of these scenarios,
     because their electronic surveillance abilities would be diminished. <p>

3. Voluntary escrowed encryption.  Escrow a de facto standard.  (This is
     the Clinton administration's proposed scenario.)  The escrowed
     encryption standard could become a de facto national standard for voice,
     fax, and data communications over the public switched telephone network.
     While other encryption products would be built, they would gain little
     market acceptance because of demand for interoperability.  Thus, law
     enforcement would be able to listen in on most transmissions.  The
     encryption technology might be exportable to countries that implemented
     the same or a similar scheme and agreed to cooperate in international
     investigations.  United States manufacturers might gain or lose in this
     scenario; they would gain only if Clipper received widespread
     acceptance.  Law enforcement agencies would gain. <p>

4. Mandatory escrowed encryption.  The government could choose to keep
     complete control over encryption and enforce a technology similar to the
     escrowed encryption standard.  Law enforcement agencies would come out
     as winners for having maintained their surveillance capabilities.  But
     a black market for foreign encryption products smuggled into the United
     States would probably be created by members of the public, including
     criminals, who desire more secrecy.  How United States companies would
     react in this scenario depends on whether this government enforced
     standard is designed to be exportable or not.  If it is unexportable,
     United States companies currently involved in the manufacture and sale
     of encryption products would be almost completely blocked from the
     international market and would be restricted to marketing the government
     enforced standard domestically. This would result in considerable
     financial loss for the industry.  Some observe [65] that mandatory
     escrowed encryption can never be exportable, since if it were then
     products would be used in one country whose keys were escrowed elsewhere
     (or not at all), and this would not come to the attention of the
     exporting country's authorities until they attempted to snoop on
     someone; they would be reduced to prosecuting that person, if at all,
     for using a non-escrowed encryption device.  If, on the other hand, the
     standard is an exportable item, and designed with an eye to the
     requirements of the international market, then United States companies
     would be better off and could maintain a level of international economic
     competitiveness. <p>

It is very difficult to determine which scenario is most likely and what its
consequences really might be.  The policy debate has to date been carried out
with each side making their own assumptions, not all of which are publicly
stated.  The economic implications for the Clipper proposal have not been
examined adequately.43   Use of an explicit model of the situation would make
these assumptions explicit, thus contributing to an informed discussion. <p>

Recently, a user-friendly computer model64  based on an Excel spreadsheet has
been developed to investigate the costs, risks, and benefits of issues
related to the National Information Infrastructure.  Issues addressed include
digital telephony, export controls of cryptography, key escrow systems,
security features in communications hardware, etc.  It is designed to allow
users with varying political perspectives to make tradeoffs based on varied
parameter values, which the users have complete control over.  While
conceding that no mathematical model can adequately represent intangible
values or political tradeoffs completely, it offers a useful first step
towards a common ground for analyzing at least some of the problems described
above.  It has recently been offered to both to government and its opponents
in the key escrow debate.  Though it is beyond the scope of this particular
project, some of the investigators of this study plan to use it to further
explore the scenarios above. <p>

Privacy As Roadkill <p>

Date: Sun, 30 Jan 1994 21:00:50 -0800
From: "Brock N. Meeks" &lt;brock@well.sf.ca.us&gt; <p>

Jacking in from a "Private No More" Port: <p>

Washington, DC -- If privacy isn't already the first victim of
roadkill along the information superhighway, then it's about to be. <p>

A law enforcement panel addressing the Administration's Information
Infrastructure Task Force Working Group on Privacy told a public
meeting here last week that it wanted to "front load" the National
Information Infrastructure with trap door technologies that would
allow them to easy access to digital conversations;  eavesdropping
on any conversation or capturing electronic communications
midstream. <p>

But only for "the bad guys."  Us honest, hard working, law abiding
citizens have nothing to fear from these law enforcement agencies
selling out our privacy rights to make their jobs easier.  Nope, we
can rest easy, knowing that child pornographers, drug traffickers
and organized crime families will be sufficiently thwarted by law
enforcement's proposed built-in gadgetry for the national
information infrastructure. <p>

There's just a small problem:  Law enforcement agencies, any law
enforcement agency, has yet to prove it needs all these proposed
digital trap doors.  In fact, according to a U.S. Assistant
Attorney appearing on the panel, "Right now most law enforcement
personnel don't have any idea what the NII is." <p>

Gore Gives Go Ahead
=================== <p>

Panel members, representing the Justice Dept., FBI and U.S.
Attorney's office, said that they took Vice President Gore's
promise that the White House would work to ensure that the NII
would "help law enforcement agencies thwart criminals and
terrorists who might use advanced telecommunications to commit
crimes," as tacit approval of their proposals to push for digital
wiretap access and government mandated encryption policies. <p>

Gore buried those remarks deep in a speech he made in Los Angeles
earlier this month when the Administration first fleshed out how it
planned to rewrite the rules for communications in a newer, perhaps
more enlightened age.  Those remarks went unnoticed by the
mainstream press.  But readers here were forewarned. <p>

Fuck Ross Perot's NAFTA-induced "giant sucking sound."  That
"thump" you just heard was Law Enforcement running over the privacy
rights of the American public on its way to the information
superhighway.  The real crime is that the collision barely dented
the damn fender. <p>

This cunning and calculated move by law enforcement to install
interception technologies all along the information superhighway
was blithely referred to as "proactive" law enforcement policy by
Assistant U.S. Attorney, Northern Dist. of California Kent Walker.
Designing these technologies into future networks, which include
all telephone systems, would ensure that law enforcement
organizations "have the same capabilities that we all enjoy right
now," Walker said. <p>

With today's wiretap operations, the Feds must get a court to
approve their request, but only after supplying enough evidence
warrant one.  But Walker seemed to be lobbying for the opposite.
Giving the Feds the ability to listen in first and give
justification later was "no big difference," he said. Besides, "it
would save time and money." <p>

It's Us vs. Them
================= <p>

For Walker privacy issues weighed against law enforcement needs are
black and white, or rather "good guys" vs. "bad guys."   For
example, he said the rapid rise of private (read: non-government
controlled) encryption technologies didn't mean law enforcement
would have to work harder.  On the contrary, "it only means we'll
catch less criminals," he said. <p>

But if law enforcement is merely concerned with the task of "just
putting the bad guys in jail," as James Settle, head of the FBI's
National Computer Crime Squad states, then why are we seeing an
unprecedented move by government intelligence agencies into areas
they have historically shied from?  Because law enforcement
agencies know their window of opportunity for asserting their
influence is right now, right at the time the government is about
to take on a fundamental shift in how it deals privacy issues
within the networks that make up the NII, says David Sobel, general
counsel for Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility
(CPSR), who also spoke as a panel member. <p>

"Because of law enforcement's concerns (regarding digital
technologies), we're seeing an unprecedented involvement by federal
security agencies in the domestic law enforcement activities,"
Sobel said. <p>

Sobel dropped-kicked this chilling fact from behind the closed
doors of the Clinton Administration into the IITF's lap:  For the
first time in history, the National Security Agency (NSA) "is now
deeply involved in the design of the public telecommunications
network." <p>

Go ahead.  Read it again. <p>

Sobel backs up his claims with hundreds of pages of previously
classified memos and reports obtained under the Freedom of
Information Act.  The involvement of the NSA in the design of our
telephone networks is, Sobel believes, a violation of federal
statutes. <p>

Sobel's also concerned that the public might soon be looking down
the throat of a classified telecommunications standard being
created.  Another move he calls "unprecedented," is that if the
NSA, FBI and other law enforcement organizations have their way,
the design of the national telecommunications network will end up
classified and withheld from the public. <p>

Sobel is dead bang on target with his warnings. <p>

The telecommunications industry and FBI have set up an ad hoc
working group to see if a technical fix for digital wiretapping can
be found to make the Bureau happy.  That way, legislation doesn't
need to be passed that might mandate such FBI access and stick the
Baby Bells with eating the full cost of reengineering their
networks. <p>

This joint group was formed during a March 26, 1992 meeting at
FBI's Quantico, Va., facilities, according previously classified
FBI documents released under Freedom of Information Act. The group
was only formalized late last year, working under the auspices of
the Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Solutions (ATIS).  The
joint industry-FBI group operates under the innocuous sounding name
of the Electronic Communications Service Provider Committee
(ECSPC). <p>

The ECSPC meets monthly with intent of seeking a technological
"solution" to the FBI's request for putting a trap door into
digital switches that would allow them easy access to those
conversations. To date, no industry solution has been found for the
digital wiretap problem, according to Kenneth Raymond, a Nynex
telephone company engineer, who is the industry co-chairman of the
group. <p>

Oh, there's also a small, but nagging problem:  The FBI hasn't
provided a concrete basis that such solutions are needed, Raymond
said.  CPSR's Sobel raised these same points during the panel
discussion. <p>

The telecommunications industry is focused on "trying to evaluate
just what is the nature of the [digital access] problem and how we
can best solve it in some reasonable way that is consistent with
cost and demand," Raymond said.   One solution might be to write
digital wiretap access into future switch specifications, he said. <p>

If and when the industry does find that solution, do you think the
FBI will put out a press release to tell us about it? "I doubt it
very much," said FBI agent Barry Smith with the Bureau's
Congressional Affairs office. "It will be done quietly, with no
media fanfare." <p>

Is it just me or are these headlights getting REALLY close? <p>

The FBI's Settle is also adamant about trap door specifications
being written into any blue prints for the National Information
Infrastructure. But there's a catch.  Settle calls these "security
measures," because they'll give his office a better chance at
"catching bad guys."  He wants all networks "to be required to
install some kind of standard for security."  And who's writing
those standards?  You guessed it:  The NSA with input from the FBI
and other assorted spook agencies. <p>

Settle defends these standards saying that the "best we have going
for us is that the criminal element hasn't yet figured out how to
use this stuff [encryption and networks in general].  When they do,
we'll be in trouble. We want to stay ahead of the curve." <p>

In the meantime, his division has to hustle.  The FBI currently has
only 25 "net literate" personnel, Settle admitted. "Most of these
were recruited 2 years ago," he said.  Most have computer science
degrees and were systems administrators at time, he said. <p>

You think that's funny?  Hell, the Net is a still small community,
relatively speaking.  One of your friends is probably an FBI Net
Snitch, working for Settle.  Don't laugh. <p>

Don't Look Now, Your Privacy Is Showing
======================================= <p>

The law enforcement establishment doesn't think you really know
what you expect when it comes to privacy. <p>

U.S. Attorney Walker says:  "If you ask the public, 'Is privacy
more important than catching criminals?'  They'll tell you, 'No.'" <p>

(Write him with your own thoughts, won't you?) <p>

Because of views like Walker's, the Electronic Communications
Privacy Act (ECPA) "needs to be broader," said Mike Godwin, legal
services counsel, for Electronic Frontier Foundation, speaking as
a panel member.  The ECPA protects transmitted data, but it also
needs to protect stored data, he said.  "A person's expectation of
privacy doesn't end when they store something on a hard disk." <p>

But Walker brushed Godwin aside saying, "It's easy to get caught up
in the rhetoric that privacy is the end all be all." <p>

Do you have an expectation of privacy for things you store on your
hard disk, in your own home?  Walker says that idea is up for
debate:  "Part of this working group is to establish what is a
reasonable expectation of privacy." <p>

That's right.  Toss everything you know or thought you knew about
privacy out the fucking window, as you cruise down the fast lane of
the information superhighway.  Why?  Because for people like
Walker, those guardians of justice, "There has to be a balance
between privacy needs and law enforcement needs to catch
criminals," he says. <p>

Balance, yes.  Total abrogation of my rights?  Fat chance. <p>

Meeks out... <p>

When You Use E-Mail at Work the Boss May Be Looking In <p>

from telecom digest <p>

When You Use E-Mail at Work the Boss May Be Looking In
By James McNair, {The Miami Herald}
Knight-Ridder/Tribune Business News <p>

Jan. 30 -- AMID the sterile drudgery of office work, a computer screen
beckons your wandering mind with the chance to escape. You send a
message to a friend elsewhere in the building. It could signal a
fleeting thought: After-work plans, an interesting new employee or a
dumb decision by a boss. Or it could open up a more riveting subject:
a smear campaign against the boss, a moonlighting venture on company
time, or stealing customer lists. <p>

Whatever you drop into the electronic mailbox, it could come back to
haunt you. In many companies, what seems to be a private communications
network -- protected by passwords, no less -- is equipped with a back
door in the computer room. <p>

In other words, your plots, your off-color barbs and your work-unrelated
digressions might be camped on a computer disk somewhere, waiting to be
read. <p>

"It's pretty much on every network," said Edward Gomez, a consultant
for Byte Computers in Miami. "There are utilities that tell you what
people are doing, what files are opening up and how much time people
are spending on the computer." <p>

Sounds like an invitation to employee rebellion, but corporations
insist they restrain themselves from systematic E-mail peeping. When
they do play back the disks, it's for legitimate business reasons,
such as investigating crimes, tracing security breaches or intercepting
customer inquiries when an employee is absent. <p>

"Some people may say it's offensive and violates their privacy, but
the employer just wants to ensure that its interests are protected,"
said Mike Losey, president of the Society for Human Resource
Management. <p>

For now, employers are having their way. The 1986 Electronic
Communications Privacy Act shields E-mail messages over public
telephone lines, but not the inter-office variety. In privacy-invasion
lawsuits across the country, courts have predominantly ruled in favor
of employers. <p>

The false belief in E-mail privacy is so great that Congress is
considering a law requiring employers to post policies, spelling out
their E-mail access rights. Some South Florida companies such as
Blockbuster Entertainment Corp., Barnett Banks and First Union Corp.
have already taken this step. <p>

Nearly 27 million U.S. workers will have an E-mail password in 1994,
up from 19 million in 1993, according to WorkGroup Technologies Inc.,
a research firm in Hampton, N.H. Given how E-mail is flourishing, the
conflict between employee right to privacy and employer right to
access was inevitable. <p>

Technology gets the brunt of the blame. Ever since desktop computer
networks started popping up as a mainstream business tool ten years
ago, computers have become alarmingly more powerful. The delivery
speed of E-mail in a typical IBM-compatible or Macintosh network has
made intracompany phone calls an absurd waste of time, handwritten
memos a relic of the past. <p>

But what turned sealed letters into open books on the E-mail system is
the new breed of networking software built into or added to computers.
Professional computer installers say the network's ability to call up
employee messages is now standard equipment. <p>

"They never ask for it," said Tim White, a consultant for Technology
Solutions in Fort Lauderdale. "It's always something companies
discover after it's there." But maybe not. <p>

According to a survey of 301 companies by Macworld magazine last July,
six percent said they read employees' in-house messages. One of five
companies said electronic monitoring is a good way to verify an act of
wrongdoing. Two of three don't bother warning their employees. <p>

Alana Shoars, former E-mail manager at Epson America in Torrance,
Calif., was one of those who told employees that their messages were
secret. Then one day in 1990, she stumbled upon a supervisor's printer
cranking out every message sent on the network. She complained and was
fired. <p>

Shoars and 170 employees sued for invasion of privacy, but lost the
case. Six months after leaving Epson, Warner Bros. hired her to run a
3,500-user E- mail system in which privacy would be guaranteed. <p>

The same Los Angeles court that ruled in favor of Epson also sided
with Nissan Motor Co. in its defense of a privacy-invasion lawsuit
filed by two employees whose messages had been read by managers they
criticized. <p>

Mentor Graphics of Wilsonville, Ore., settled a similar lawsuit filed
by two employees, even though it said the E-mail trail showed that the
employees had been stealing trade secrets. <p>

Occasionally, corporations are the first to go to court. Last year,
Borland International of Scotts Valley, Calif., pressed charges
against a vice president who had been sending marketing plans and
product-release dates to the president of a cross-town rival. Both men
were indicted, but they defended themselves by accusing Borland of
violating the Electronic Communications Privacy Act ban on tapping
messages sent on commercial E-mail lines. <p>

The charges and a related lawsuit filed by Borland are still pending.
Lawsuits are repulsive ways to settle differences, but they have
served a good purpose in fomenting a spirited debate between employee
and employer rights on the E-mail network. Privacy advocates take the
side of the Bill of Rights. On the other side is a well-entrenched
business lobby fighting for the plain right to use its equipment as it
sees fit. <p>

Lewis Maltby, director of the American Civil Liberties Union's
Workplace Rights Project, said corporate E-mail systems should allow
for some, if not full privacy. <p>

As it is, he said, the issuance of passwords and their suggestion of
confidentiality gives employees a false impression of privacy. <p>

"Employers should think twice about reading messages because employees
will clam up," Maltby said. "No one's going to be candid if they know
someone's looking over their shoulder all the time." <p>

Some companies actually share employees' desire for E-mail privacy.
Among those in South Florida, IBM Corp., Motorola, Siemens and the law
firm Greenberg Traurig all say they can't read or recall employees'
messages. <p>

Companies that can tap the E-mail system say they do so with
restraint.  "Managers don't have the ability to say, 'Print me out a
report of all the E-mail communications that went out of my group last
month,"' said Ken Smalling, a spokesman for Electronic Data Systems,
which has about 300 employees at its System One airline reservations
unit in Miramar. <p>

Others ducked questions about their E-mail monitoring powers. "No
one's comfortable with saying something publicly," said Ryder System
spokeswoman Terri Kopec. "We don't want our employees reading about it
in the paper." <p>

"We'll take a pass on this one," said W.R. Grace spokesman Fred Bona.
Government E-mail users have the least privacy of all -- even in the
Oval Office. Last year, a federal judge ruled that millions of E-mail
messages stored during the Reagan and Bush years must be preserved
under the same guidelines as paper communications. <p>

In Broward County, all E-mail notes are public records. In Metro Dade,
the issue is moot because the computer system isn't capable of
recalling E- mail. <p>

While lawmakers and courts have upheld employers' full access to
E-mail content, bills winding through Congress would ensure that
employees are explicitly warned. Sponsored by Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill.,
and Rep. Pat Williams, D-Mont., it would require companies to post
E-mail policy statements in the workplace. <p>

Many companies -- partly at the urging of their attorneys -- are ahead
of the law, including First Union, Barnett Banks and Blockbuster
Entertainment.  First Union's policy, released last August, lists when
the bank can rifle through E-mail files. <p>

"We saw a need to put a policy into place so that everybody knew
exactly what we could and couldn't do," said First Union spokesman
Monty Hagler. "It's a big issue when you have 18,000 users. You don't
want to wait for trouble." <p>

<TITLE>Selling Wine Without Bottles, by John Perry Barlow</TITLE>
<H1>Selling Wine Without Bottles</H1>

<I>The Economy of Mind on the Global Net
<BR>by John Perry Barlow</I>

<HR> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
   If nature has made any one thing less susceptible than
   all others of exclusive property, it is the action of the
   thinking power called an idea, which an individual may
   exclusively possess as long as he keeps it to himself;
   but the moment it is divulged, it forces itself into the
   possession of everyone, and the receiver cannot
   dispossess himself of it. Its peculiar character, too, is
   that no one possesses the less, because every other
   possesses the whole of it. He who receives an idea from
   me, receives instruction himself without lessening mine;
   as he who lights his taper at mine, receives light
   without darkening me. That ideas should freely spread
   from one to another over the globe, for the moral and
   mutual instruction of man, and improvement of his
   condition, seems to have been peculiarly and benevolently
   designed by nature, when she made them, like fire,
   expansible over all space, without lessening their
   density at any point, and like the air in which we
   breathe, move, and have our physical being, incapable of
   confinement or exclusive appropriation.  Inventions then
   cannot, in nature, be a subject of property. <p>

<PRE>                          -- Thomas Jefferson</PRE><p>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<hr> <p>

Throughout the time I've been groping around Cyberspace, there has
remained unsolved an immense conundrum that seems to be at the root of
nearly every legal, ethical, governmental, and social vexation to be
found in the Virtual World. I refer to the problem of digitized
property. <p>

The riddle is this: if our property can be infinitely reproduced and
instantaneously distributed all over the planet without cost, without
our knowledge, without its even leaving our possession, how can we
protect it? How are we going to get paid for the work we do with our
minds? And, if we can't get paid, what will assure the continued
creation and distribution of such work? <p>

Since we don't have a solution to what is a profoundly new kind of
challenge, and are apparently unable to delay the galloping
digitization of everything not obstinately physical, we are sailing
into the future on a sinking ship. <p>

This vessel, the accumulated canon of copyright and patent law, was
developed to convey forms and methods of expression entirely different
from the vaporous cargo it is now being asked to carry. It is leaking
as much from within as without. <p>

Legal efforts to keep the old boat floating are taking three forms: a
frenzy of deck chair rearrangement, stern warnings to the passengers
that if she goes down, they will face harsh criminal penalties, and
serene, glassy-eyed denial. <p>

Intellectual property law cannot be patched, retrofitted, or expanded
to contain the gasses of digitized expression any more than real
estate law might be revised to cover the allocation of broadcasting
spectrum. (Which, in fact, rather resembles what is being attempted
here.) We will need to develop an entirely new set of methods as
befits this entirely new set of circumstances. <p>

Most of the people who actually create soft property--the programmers,
hackers, and Net surfers--already know this. Unfortunately, neither
the companies they work for nor the lawyers these companies hire have
enough direct experience with immaterial goods to understand why they
are so problematic. They are proceeding as though the old laws can
somehow be made to work, either by grotesque expansion or by force.
They are wrong. <p>

The source of this conundrum is as simple as its solution is complex.
Digital technology is detaching information from the physical plane,
where property law of all sorts has always found definition. <p>

Throughout the history of copyrights and patents, the proprietary
assertions of thinkers have been focused not on their ideas but on the
expression of those ideas. The ideas themselves, as well as facts
about the phenomena of the world, were considered to be the collective
property of humanity. One could claim franchise, in the case of
copyright, on the precise turn of phrase used to convey a particular
idea or the order in which facts were presented. <p>

The point at which this franchise was imposed was that moment when the
"word became flesh" by departing the mind of its originator and
entering some physical object, whether book or widget. The subsequent
arrival of other commercial media besides books didn't alter the legal
importance of this moment. Law protected expression and, with few (and
recent) exceptions, to express was to make physical. <p>

Protecting physical expression had the force of convenience on its
side. Copyright worked well because, Gutenberg notwithstanding, it was
hard to make a book.  Furthermore, books froze their contents into a
condition that was as challenging to alter as it was to reproduce.
Counterfeiting or distributing counterfeit volumes were obvious and
visible activities, easy enough to catch somebody in the act of doing.
Finally, unlike unbounded words or images, books had material surfaces
to which one could attach copyright notices, publisher's marques, and
price tags. <p>

Mental to physical conversion was even more central to patent. A
patent, until recently, was either a description of the form into
which materials were to be rendered in the service of some purpose or
a description of the process by which rendition occurred. In either
case, the conceptual heart of patent was the material result. If no
purposeful object could be rendered due to some material limitation,
the patent was rejected. Neither a Klein bottle nor a shovel made of
silk could be patented. It had to be a thing and the thing had to
work. <p>

Thus the rights of invention and authorship adhered to activities in
the physical world.  One didn't get paid for ideas but for the ability
to deliver them into reality.  For all practical purposes, the value
was in the conveyance and not the thought conveyed. <p>

In other words, the bottle was protected, not the wine. <p>

Now, as information enters Cyberspace, the native home of Mind, these
bottles are vanishing. With the advent of digitization, it is now
possible to replace all previous information storage forms with one
meta-bottle: complex--and highly liquid--patterns of ones and zeros. <p>

Even the physical/digital bottles to which we've become accustomed,
floppy disks, CD- ROM's, and other discrete, shrink-wrappable
bit-packages, will disappear as all computers jack in to the global
Net. While the Internet may never include every single CPU on the
planet, it is more than doubling every year and can be expected to
become the principal medium of information conveyance if, eventually,
the only one. <p>

Once that has happened, all the goods of the Information Age--all of
expressions once contained in books or film strips or records or
newsletters--will exist either as pure thought or something very much
like thought: voltage conditions darting around the Net at the speed
of light, in conditions which one might behold in effect, as glowing
pixels or transmitted sounds, but never touch or claim to "own" in the
old sense of the word. <p>

Some might argue that information will still require some physical
manifestation, such as its magnetic existence on the titanic hard
disks of distant servers, but these are bottles that have no
macroscopically discrete or personally meaningful form. <p>

Some will also argue that we have been dealing with unbottled
expression since the advent of radio, and they would be right. But for
most of the history of broadcast, there was no convenient way to
capture soft goods from the electromagnetic ether and reproduce them
in anything like the quality available in commercial packages. Only
recently has this changed and little has been done legally or
technically to address the change. <p>

Generally, the issue of consumer payment for broadcast products was
irrelevant. The consumers themselves were the product.  Broadcast
media were supported either by selling the attention of their audience
to advertisers, using government to assess payment through taxes, or
the whining mendicancy of annual donor drives. <p>

All of broadcast support models are flawed. Support either by
advertisers or government has almost invariably tainted the purity of
the goods delivered. Besides, direct marketing is gradually killing
the advertiser support model anyway. <p>

Broadcast media gave us another payment method for a virtual product
in the royalties which broadcasters pay songwriters through such
organizations as ASCAP and BMI.  But, as a member of ASCAP, I can
assure you this is not a model that we should emulate.  The monitoring
methods are wildly approximate. There is no parallel system of
accounting in the revenue stream. It doesn't really work. Honest. <p>

In any case, without our old methods of physically defining the
expression of ideas, and in the absence of successful new models for
non-physical transaction, we simply don't know how to assure reliable
payment for mental works. To make matters worse, this comes at a time
when the human mind is replacing sunlight and mineral deposits as the
principal source of new wealth. <p>

Furthermore, the increasing difficulty of enforcing existing copyright
and patent laws is already placing in peril the ultimate source of
intellectual property, the free exchange of ideas. <p>

That is, when the primary articles of commerce in a society look so
much like speech as to be indistinguishable from it, and when the
traditional methods of protecting their ownership have become
ineffectual, attempting to fix the problem with broader and more
vigorous enforcement will inevitably threaten freedom of speech. <p>

The greatest constraint on your future liberties may come not from
government but from corporate legal departments laboring to protect by
force what can no longer be protected by practical efficiency or
general social consent. <p>

Furthermore, when Jefferson and his fellow creatures of The
Enlightenment designed the system that became American copyright law,
their primary objective was assuring the widespread distribution of
thought, not profit. Profit was the fuel that would carry ideas into
the libraries and minds of their new republic. Libraries would
purchase books, thus rewarding the authors for their work in
assembling ideas, which otherwise "incapable of confinement" would
then become freely available to the public. But what is the role of
libraries if there are no books? How does society now pay for the
distribution of ideas if not by charging for the ideas themselves? <p>

Additionally complicating the matter is the fact that along with the
physical bottles in which intellectual property protection has
resided, digital technology is also erasing the legal jurisdictions of
the physical world, and replacing them with the unbounded and perhaps
permanently lawless seas of Cyberspace. <p>

In Cyberspace, there are not only no national or local boundaries to
contain the scene of a crime and determine the method of its
prosecution, there are no clear cultural agreements on what a crime
might be. Unresolved and basic differences between European and Asian
cultural assumptions about intellectual property can only be
exacerbated in a region where many transactions are taking place in
both hemispheres and yet, somehow, in neither. <p>

Even in the most local of digital conditions, jurisdiction and
responsibility are hard to assess. A group of music publishers filed
suit against Compuserve this fall for it having allowed its users to
upload musical compositions into areas where other users might get
them. But since Compuserve cannot practically exercise much control
over the flood of bits that pass between its subscribers, it probably
shouldn't be held responsible for unlawfully "publishing" these works. <p>

Notions of property, value, ownership, and the nature of wealth itself
are changing more fundamentally than at any time since the Sumerians
first poked cuneiform into wet clay and called it stored grain. Only a
very few people are aware of the enormity of this shift and fewer of
them are lawyers or public officials. <p>

Those who do see these changes must prepare responses for the legal
and social confusion that will erupt as efforts to protect new forms
of property with old methods become more obviously futile, and, as a
consequence, more adamant. <p>

<H2>From Swords To Writs To Bits</H2>

Humanity now seems bent on creating a world economy primarily based on
goods that take no material form.  In doing so, we may be eliminating
any predictable connection between creators and a fair reward for the
utility or pleasure others may find in their works. <p>

Without that connection, and without a fundamental change in
consciousness to accommodate its loss, we are building our future on
furor, litigation, and institutionalized evasion of payment except in
response to raw force. We may return to the Bad Old Days of property. <p>

Throughout the darker parts of human history, the possession and
distribution of property was a largely military matter. "Ownership"
was assured those with the nastiest tools, whether fists or armies,
and the most resolute will to use them. Property was the divine right
of thugs. <p>

By the turn of the First Millennium A.D., the emergence of merchant
classes and landed gentry forced the development of ethical
understandings for the resolution of property disputes. In the late
Middle Ages, enlightened rulers like England's Henry II began to
codify this unwritten "common law" into recorded canons. These laws
were local, but this didn't matter much as they were primarily
directed at real estate, a form of property that is local by
definition. And which, as the name implied, was very real. <p>

This continued to be the case as long as the origin of wealth was
agricultural, but with dawning of the Industrial Revolution, humanity
began to focus as much on means as ends. Tools acquired a new social
value and, thanks to their own development, it became possible to
duplicate and distribute them in quantity. <p>

To encourage their invention, copyright and patent law were developed
in most western countries. These laws were devoted to the delicate
task of getting mental creations into the world where they could be
used--and enter the minds of others--while assuring their inventors
compensation for the value of their use.  And, as previously stated,
the systems of both law and practice that grew up around that task
were based on physical expression. <p>

Since it is now possible to convey ideas from one mind to another
without ever making them physical, we are now claiming to own ideas
themselves and not merely their expression. And since it is likewise
now possible to create useful tools that never take physical form. we
have taken to patenting abstractions, sequences of virtual events, and
mathematical formulae--the most un-real estate imaginable. <p>

In certain areas, this leaves rights of ownership in such an ambiguous
condition that once again property adheres to those who can muster the
largest armies. The only difference is that this time the armies
consist of lawyers. <p>

Threatening their opponents with the endless Purgatory of litigation,
over which some might prefer death itself, they assert claim to any
thought that might have entered another cranium within the collective
body of the corporations they serve. They act as though these ideas
appeared in splendid detachment from all previous human thought.  And
they pretend that thinking about a product is somehow as good as
manufacturing, distributing, and selling it. <p>

What was previously considered a common human resource, distributed
among the minds and libraries of the world, as well as the phenomena
of nature herself, is now being fenced and deeded. It is as though a
new class of enterprise had arisen which claimed to own air and water. <p>

What is to be done? While there is a certain grim fun to be had in it,
dancing on the grave of copyright and patent will solve little,
especially when so few are willing to admit that the occupant of this
grave is even deceased and are trying to up by force what can no
longer be upheld by popular consent. <p>

The legalists, desperate over their slipping grip, are vigorously
trying to extend it.  Indeed, the United States and other proponents
of GATT are making are making adherence to our moribund systems of
intellectual property protection a condition of membership in the
marketplace of nations. For example, China will be denied Most Favored
nation trading status unless they agree to uphold a set of culturally
alien principles that are no longer even sensibly applicable in their
country of origin. <p>

In a more perfect world, we'd be wise to declare a moratorium on
litigation, legislation, and international treaties in this area until
we had a clearer sense of the terms and conditions of enterprise in
Cyberspace. Ideally, laws ratify already developed social consensus.
They are less the Social Contract itself than a series of memoranda
expressing a collective intent that has emerged out of many millions
of human interactions. <p>

Humans have not inhabited Cyberspace long enough or in sufficient
diversity to have developed a Social Contract that conforms to the
strange new conditions of that world.  Laws developed prior to
consensus usually serve the already established few who can get them
passed and not society as a whole. <p>

To the extent that either law or established social practice exists in
this area, they are already in dangerous disagreement. The laws
regarding unlicensed reproduction of commercial software are clear and
stern...and rarely observed. Software piracy laws are so practically
unenforceable and breaking them has become so socially acceptable that
only a thin minority appears compelled, either by fear or conscience,
to obey them. <p>

I sometimes give speeches on this subject, and I always ask how many
people in the audience can honestly claim to have no unauthorized
software on their hard disks. I've never seen more than ten percent of
the hands go up. <p>

Whenever there is such profound divergence between the law and social
practice, it is not society that adapts. And, against the swift tide
of custom, the Software Publishers' current practice of hanging a few
visible scapegoats is so obviously capricious as to only further
diminish respect for the law. <p>

Part of the widespread popular disregard for commercial software
copyrights stems from a legislative failure to understand the
conditions into which it was inserted. To assume that systems of law
based in the physical world will serve in an environment that is as
fundamentally different as Cyberspace is a folly for which everyone
doing business in the future will pay. <p>

As I will discuss in the next segment, unbounded intellectual property
is very different from physical property and can no longer be
protected as though these differences did not exist. For example, if
we continue to assume that value is based on scarcity, as it is with
regard to physical objects, we will create laws that are precisely
contrary to the nature of information, which may, in many cases,
increase in value with distribution. <p>

The large, legally risk-averse institutions most likely to play by the
old rules will suffer for their compliance. The more lawyers, guns,
and money they invest in either protecting their rights or subverting
those of their opponents, the more commercial competition will
resemble the Kwakiutl Potlatch Ceremony, in which adversaries competed
by destroying their own possessions. Their ability to produce new
technology will simply grind to a halt as every move they make drives
them deeper into a tar pit of courtroom warfare. <p>

Faith in law will not be an effective strategy for high tech
companies. Law adapts by continuous increments and at a pace second
only to geology in its stateliness.  Technology advances in the
lunging jerks, like the punctuation of biological evolution
grotesquely accelerated. Real world conditions will continue to change
at a blinding pace, and the law will get further behind, more
profoundly confused. This mismatch is permanent. <p>

Promising economies based on purely digital products will either be
born in a state of paralysis, as appears to be the case with
multimedia, or continue in a brave and willful refusal by their owners
to play the ownership game at all. <p>

In the United States one can already see a parallel economy
developing, mostly among small fast moving enterprises who protect
their ideas by getting into the marketplace quicker then their larger
competitors who base their protection on fear and litigation. <p>

Perhaps those who are part of the problem will simply quarantine
themselves in court while those who are part of the solution will
create a new society based, at first, on piracy and freebooting. It
may be that when the current system of intellectual property law has
collapsed, as seems inevitable, that no new legal structure will arise
in its place. <p>

But something will happen. After all, people do business. When a
currency becomes meaningless, business is done in barter. When
societies develop outside the law, they develop their own unwritten
codes, practices, and ethical systems. While technology may undo law,
technology offers methods for restoring creative rights. <p>

<H2>A Taxonomy Of Information</H2>

It seems to me that the most productive thing to do now is to look
hard into the true nature of what we're trying to protect.  How much
do we really know about information and its natural behaviors? <p>

What are the essential characteristics of unbounded creation? How does
it differ from previous forms of property? How many of our assumptions
about it have actually been about its containers rather than their
mysterious contents? What are its different species and how does each
of them lend itself to control? What technologies will be useful in
creating new virtual bottles to replace the old physical ones? <p>

Of course, information is, by its nature, intangible and hard to
define. Like other such deep phenomena as light or matter, it is a
natural host to paradox. And as it is most helpful to understand light
as being both a particle and a wave, an understanding of information
may emerge in the abstract congruence of its several different
properties that might be described by the following three statements: <p>

<UL>
<LI> Information is an activity.
<LI> Information is a life form.
<LI> Information is a relationship.
</UL>

In the following section, I will examine each of these. <p>

<H3>Information Is An Activity</H3>

<H4>Information Is a Verb, Not a Noun.</H4>

Freed of its containers, information is obviously not a thing. In
fact, it is something that happens in the field of interaction between
minds or objects or other pieces of information. <p>

Gregory Bateson, expanding on the information theory of Claude
Shannon, said, "Information is a difference which makes a difference."
Thus, information only really exists in the  [delta]. The making
of that difference is an activity within a relationship.  Information
is an action that occupies time rather than a state of being which
occupies physical space, as is the case with hard goods. It is the
pitch, not the baseball, the dance, not the dancer. <p>

<H4>Information Is Experienced, Not Possessed</H4>

Even when it has been encapsulated in some static form like a book or
a hard disk, information is still something that happens to you as you
mentally decompress it from its storage code. But, whether it's
running at gigabits per second or words per minute, the actual
decoding is a process that must be performed by and upon a mind, a
process that must take place in time. <p>

There was a cartoon in the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists a few years
ago which illustrated this point beautifully. In the drawing, a holdup
man trains his gun on the sort of bespectacled fellow you'd figure
might have a lot of information stored in his head.  "Quick," orders
the bandit, "Give me all your ideas." <p>

<H4>Information Has To Move</H4>

Sharks are said to die of suffocation if they stop swimming, and the
same is nearly true of information. Information that isn't moving
ceases to exist as anything but potential...at least until it is
allowed to move again. For this reason, the practice of information
hoarding, common in bureaucracies, is an especially wrong-headed
artifact of physically based value systems. <p>

<H4>Information is Conveyed by Propagation, Not Distribution</H4>


The way in which information spreads is also very different from the
distribution of physical goods. It moves more like something from
nature than from a factory. It can concatenate like falling dominos or
grow in the usual fractal lattice, like frost spreading on a window,
but it cannot be shipped around like widgets, except to the extent
that it can be contained in them. It doesn't simply move on. It leaves
a trail of itself everywhere it's been. <p>

The central economic distinction between information and physical
property is the ability of information to be transferred without
leaving the possession of the original owner. If I sell you my horse,
I can't ride him after that. If I sell you what I know, we both know
it. <p>

<H3>Information Is A Life Form</H3>

<H4>Information wants to be free.</H4>


Stewart Brand is generally credited with this elegant statement of the
obvious, recognizing both the natural desire of secrets to be told and
the fact that they might be capable of possessing something like a
"desire" in the first place. <p>

English Biologist and Philosopher Richard Dawkins proposed the idea of
"memes," self- replicating, patterns of information that propagate
themselves across the ecologies of mind, saying they were like life
forms. <p>

I believe they are life forms in every respect but a basis in the
carbon atom. They self- reproduce, they interact with their
surroundings and adapt to them, they mutate, they persist. Like any
other life form they evolve to fill the possibility spaces of their
local environments, which are, in this case the surrounding belief
systems and cultures of their hosts, namely, us. <p>

Indeed, the sociobiologists like Dawkins make a plausible case that
carbon-based life forms are information as well, that, as the chicken
is an egg's way of making another egg, the entire biological spectacle
is just the DNA molecule's means of copying out more information
strings exactly like itself. <p>

<H4>Information Replicates into the Cracks of Possibility</H4>

Like DNA helices, ideas are relentless expansionists, always seeking
new opportunities for lebensraum. And, as in carbon-based nature, the
more robust organisms are extremely adept at finding new places to
live. Thus, just as the common housefly has insinuated itself into
practically every ecosystem on the planet, so has the meme of "life
after death" found a niche in most minds, or psycho-ecologies. <p>

The more universally resonant an idea or image or song, the more minds
it will enter and remain within. Trying to stop the spread of a really
robust piece of information is about as easy as keeping killer bees
South of the Border.  The stuff just leaks. <p>

<H4>Information Wants To Change</H4>


If ideas and other interactive patterns of information are indeed life
forms, they can be expected to evolve constantly into forms that will
be more perfectly adapted to their surroundings. And, as we see, they
are doing this all the time. <p>

But for a long time, our static media, whether carvings in stone, ink
on paper, or dye on celluloid, have strongly resisted the evolutionary
impulse, exalting as a consequence the author's ability to determine
the finished product.  But, as in an oral tradition, digitized
information has no "final cut." <p>

Digital information, unconstrained by packaging, is a continuing
process more like the metamorphosing tales of prehistory than anything
that will fit in shrink wrap. From the Neolithic to Gutenberg,
information was passed on, mouth to ear, changing with every
re-telling (or re-singing). The stories that once shaped our sense of
the world didn't have authoritative versions. They adapted to each
culture in which they found themselves being told. <p>

Because there was never a moment when the story was frozen in print,
the so-called "moral" right of storytellers to keep the tale their own
was neither protected nor recognized. The story simply passed through
each of them on its way to the next, where it would assume a different
form. As we return to continuous information, we can expect the
importance of authorship to diminish. Creative people may have to
renew their acquaintance with humility. <p>

But our system of copyright makes no accommodation whatever for
expressions that don't at some point become "fixed" nor for cultural
expressions which lack a specific author or inventor. <p>

Jazz improvisations, standup comedy routines, mime performances,
developing monologues, and unrecorded broadcast transmissions all lack
the Constitutional requirement of fixation as a "writing. Without
being fixed by a point of publicatoin the liquid works of the future
will all look more like these continuously adapting and changing forms
and will therefore exist beyond the reach of copyright. <p>

Copyright expert Pamela Samuelson tells of having attended a
conference last year convened around the fact that Western countries
may legally appropriate the music, designs, and biomedical lore of
aboriginal people without compensation to their tribe of origin since
that tribe is not an "author" or "inventor." <p>

But soon most information will be generated collaboratively by the
cyber-tribal hunter- gatherers of Cyberspace. Our arrogant legal
dismissal of the rights of "primitives" will be back to haunt us soon. <p>

<H4>Information is Perishable</H4>


With the exception of the rare classic, most information is like farm
produce. Its quality degrades rapidly both over time and in distance
from the source of production. But even here, value is highly
subjective and conditional. Yesterday's papers are quite valuable to
the historian. In fact, the older they are, the more valuable they
become. On the other hand, a commodities broker might consider news of
an event that is more than an hour old to have lost any relevance. <p>

<H3>Information Is A Relationship</H3>

<H4>Meaning Has Value and Is Unique to Each Case</H4>

In most cases, we assign value to information based on its
meaningfulness. The place where information dwells, the holy moment
where transmission becomes reception, is a region that has many
shifting characteristics and flavors depending on the relationship of
sender and receiver, the depth of their interactivity. <p>

Each such relationship is unique. Even in cases where the sender is a
broadcast medium, and no response is returned, the receiver is hardly
passive. Receiving information is often as creative an act as
generating it. <p>

The value of what is sent depends entirely on the extent to which each
individual receiver has the receptors...shared terminology, attention,
interest, language, paradigm...necessary to render what is received
meaningful. <p>

Understanding is a critical element increasingly overlooked in the
effort to turn information into a commodity. Data may be any set of
facts, useful or not, intelligible or inscrutable, germane or
irrelevant. Computers can crank out new data all night long without
human help, and the results may be offered for sale as information.
They may or may not actually be so. Only a human being can recognize
the meaning that separates information from data. <p>

In fact, information, in the economic sense of the word, consists of
data that have been passed through a particular human mind and found
meaningful within that mental context. One fella's information is all
just data to someone else. If you're an anthropologist, my detailed
charts of Tasaday kinship patterns might be critical information to
you. If you're a banker from Hong Kong, they might barely seem to be
data. <p>

<H4>Familiarity Has More Value Than Scarcity</H4>


With physical goods, there is a direct correlation between scarcity
and value. Gold is more valuable than wheat, even though you can't eat
it. While this is not always the case, the situation with information
is usually precisely the reverse. Most soft goods increase in value as
they become more common. Familiarity is an important asset in the
world of information. It may often be the case that the best thing you
can do to raise the demand for your product is to give it away. <p>

While this has not always worked with shareware, it could be argued
that there is a connection between the extent to which commercial
software is pirated and the amount that gets sold. Broadly pirated
software, such as Lotus 1-2-3 or WordPerfect, becomes a standard and
benefits from Law of Increasing Returns based on familiarity. <p>

Regarding my own soft product, rock and roll songs, there is no
question that the band I write them for, the Grateful Dead, has
increased its popularity enormously by giving them away. We have been
letting people tape our concerts since the early seventies, but
instead of reducing the demand for our product, we are now the largest
concert draw in America, a fact that is at least in part attributable
to the popularity generated by those tapes. <p>

True, I don't get any royalties on the millions of copies of my songs
that have been extracted from concerts, but I see no reason to
complain. The fact is, no one but the Grateful Dead can perform a
Grateful Dead song, so if you want the experience and not its thin
projection, you have to buy a ticket from us. In other words, our
intellectual property protection derives from our being the only
real-time source of it. <p>

<H4>Exclusivity Has Value</H4>


The problem with a model that turns the physical scarcity/value ratio
on its head is that sometimes the value of information is very much
based on its scarcity. Exclusive possession of certain facts makes
them more useful. If everyone knows about conditions that might drive
a stock price up, the information is valueless. <p>

But again, the critical factor is usually time. It doesn't matter if
this kind of information eventually becomes ubiquitous. What matters
is being among the first who possess it and act on it. While potent
secrets usually don't stay secret, they may remain so long enough to
advance the cause of their original holders. <p>

<H4>Point of View and Authority Have Value</H4>


In a world of floating realities and contradictory maps, rewards will
accrue to those commentators whose maps seem to fit their territory
snugly, based on their ability to yield predictable results for those
who use them. <p>

In aesthetic information, whether poetry or rock 'n' roll, people are
willing to buy the new product of an artist, sight-unseen, based on
their having been delivered a pleasurable experience by previous work. <p>

Reality is an edit. People are willing to pay for the authority of
those editors whose filtering point of view seems to fit best. And
again, point of view is an asset that cannot be stolen or duplicated.
No one but Esther Dyson sees the world as she does and the handsome
fee she charges for her newsletter is actually for the privilege of
looking at the world through her unique eyes. <p>

<H4>Time Replaces Space</H4>


In the physical world, value depends heavily on possession, or
proximity in space. One owns that material that falls inside certain
dimensional boundaries and the ability to act directly, exclusively,
and as one wishes upon what falls inside those boundaries is the
principal right of ownership. And of course there is the relationship
between value and scarcity, a limitation in space. <p>

In the virtual world, proximity in time is a value determinant. An
informational product is generally more valuable the closer the
purchaser can place himself to the moment of its expression, a
limitation in time. Many kinds of information degrade rapidly with
either time or reproduction. Relevance fades as the territory they map
changes. Noise is introduced and bandwidth lost with passage away from
the point where the information is first produced.
  
Thus, listening to a Grateful Dead tape is hardly the same experience
as attending a Grateful Dead concert. The closer one can get to the
headwaters of an informational stream, the better his changes of
finding an accurate picture of reality in it.  In an era of easy
reproduction, the informational abstractions of popular experiences
will propagate out from their source moments to reach anyone who's
interested. But it's easy enough to restrict the real experience of
the desirable event, whether knock-out punch or guitar lick, to those
willing to pay for being there. <p>

<H4>The Protection of Execution</H4>


In the hick town I come from, they don't give you much credit for just
having ideas. You are judged by what you can make of them. As things
continue to speed up, I think we see that execution is the best
protection for those designs that become physical products.  Or, as
Steve Jobs once put it, "Real artists ship." The big winner is usually
the one who gets to the market first (and with enough organizational
force to keep the lead). <p>

But, as we become fixated upon information commerce, many of us seem
to think that originality alone is sufficient to convey value,
deserving, with the right legal assurances, of a steady wage. In fact,
the best way to protect intellectual property is to act on it. It's
not enough to invent and patent, one has to innovate as well. Someone
claims to have patented the microprocessor before Intel. Maybe so. If
he'd actually started shipping microprocessors before Intel, his claim
would seem far less spurious. <p>

<H4>Information as Its Own Reward</H4>


It is now a commonplace to say that money is information. With the
exception of Krugerands, crumpled cab-fare, and the contents of those
suit-cases which drug lords are reputed to carry, most of the money in
the informatized world is in ones and zeros.  The global money supply
sloshes around the Net, as fluid as weather. It is also obvious, as I
have discussed, that information has become as fundamental to the
creation of modern wealth as land and sunlight once were. <p>

What is less obvious is the extent to which information is acquiring
intrinsic value, not as a means to acquisition but as the object to be
acquired. I suppose this has always been less explicitly the case. In
politics and academia, potency and information have always been
closely related. <p>

However, as we increasingly buy information with money, we begin to
see that buying information with other information is simple economic
exchange without the necessity of converting the product into and out
of currency. This is somewhat challenging for those who like clean
accounting, since, information theory aside, informational exchange
rates are too squishy to quantify to the decimal point. <p>

Nevertheless, most of what a middle class American purchases has
little to do with survival. We buy beauty, prestige, experience,
education, and all the obscure pleasures of owning. Many of these
things can not only be expressed in non-material terms, they can be
acquired by non-material means. <p>

And then there are the inexplicable pleasures of information itself,
the joys of learning, knowing, and teaching. The strange good feeling
of information coming into and out of oneself. Playing with ideas is a
recreation which people must be willing to pay a lot for, given the
market for books and elective seminars. We'd likely spend even more
money for such pleasures if there weren't so many opportunities to pay
for ideas with other ideas. <p>

This explains much of the collective "volunteer" work that fills the
archives, newsgroups, and databases of the Internet. Its denizens are
not working for nothing, as is widely believed. Rather they are
getting paid in something besides money. It is an economy that
consists almost entirely of information. <p>

This may become the dominant form of human trade, and if we persist in
modeling economics on a strictly monetary basis, we may be gravely
misled. <p>

<H2>GETTING PAID IN CYBERSPACE</H2>

How all the foregoing relates to solutions to the crisis in
intellectual property is something I've barely started to wrap my mind
around. It's fairly paradigm-warping to look at information through
fresh eyes--to see how very little it is like pig iron or pork
bellies, to imagine the tottering travesties of case law we will stack
up if we go on treating it legally as though it were. <p>

As I've said, I believe these towers of outmoded boilerplate will
be a smoking heap sometime in the next decade and we mind miners will
have no choice but to cast our lot with new systems that work. <p>

I'm not really so gloomy about our prospects as readers of this
jeremiad so far might conclude.  Solutions will emerge. Nature abhors
a vacuum and so does commerce. <p>

Indeed, one of the aspects of the electronic frontier that I have
always found most appealing--and the reason Mitch Kapor and I used
that phrase in naming our foundation--is the degree to which it
resembles the 19th Century American West in its natural preference for
social devices which emerge from it conditions rather than those which
are imposed from the outside. <p>

Until the West was fully settled and "civilized" in this century,
order was established according to an unwritten Code of the West that
had the fluidity of etiquette rather than the rigidity of law. Ethics
were more important than rules. Understandings were preferred over
laws, which were, in any event, largely unenforceable. <p>

I believe that law, as we understand it, was developed to protect the
interests that arose in the two economic "waves" which Alvin Toffler
accurately identified in The Third Wave.  The First Wave was
agriculturally based and required law to order ownership of the
principal source of production, land. In the Second Wave,
manufacturing became the economic mainspring, and the structure of
modern law grew around the centralized institutions that needed
protection for their reserves of capital, manpower, and hardware. <p>

Both of these economic systems required stability. Their laws were
designed to resist change and to assure some equability of
distribution within a fairly static social framework. The possibility
spaces had to be constrained to preserve the predictability necessary
to either land stewardship or capital formation. <p>

In the Third Wave we have now entered, information to a large extent
replaces land, capital, and hardware, and as I have detailed in the
preceding section, information is most at home in a much more fluid
and adaptable environment. The Third Wave is likely to bring a
fundamental shift in the purposes and methods of law that will affect
far more than simply those statutes that govern intellectual property. <p>

The "terrain" itself--the architecture of the Net--may come to serve
many of the purposes that could only be maintained in the past by
legal imposition. For example, it may be unnecessary to
constitutionally assure freedom of expression in an environment that,
in the words of my fellow EFF co-founder John Gilmore, "treats
censorship as a malfunction" and re-routes proscribed ideas around it. <p>

Similar natural balancing mechanisms may arise to smooth over the
social discontinuities that previously required legal intercession to
set right. On the Net, these differences are more likely to be spanned
by a continuous spectrum that connects as much as it separates. <p>

And, despite their fierce grip on the old legal structure, companies
which trade in information are likely to find that in their increasing
inability to deal sensibly with technological issues, the courts will
not produce results that are predictable enough to be supportive of
long-term enterprise. Every litigation becomes like a game of Russian
roulette, depending on the depth the presiding judge's
clue-impairment. <p>

Uncodified or adaptive "law," while as "fast, loose, and out of
control" as other emergent forms, is probably more likely to yield
something like justice at this point. In fact, one can already see in
development new practices to suit the conditions of virtual commerce.
The life forms of information are evolving methods to protect their
continued reproduction. <p>

For example, while all the tiny print on a commercial diskette
envelope punctiliously requires much of that who would open it, there
are, as I say, few who read those provisos, let alone follow them to
the letter. And yet, the software business remains a very healthy
sector of the American economy. <p>

Why is this? Because people seem to eventually buy the software they
really use. Once a program becomes central to your work, you want the
latest version of it, the best support, the actual manuals, all
privileges that are attached to ownership. Such practical
considerations will, in the absence of working law, become more and
more important in important in getting paid for what might easily be
obtained for nothing. <p>

I do think that some software is being purchased in the service of
ethics or the abstract awareness that the failure to buy it will
result in its not being produced any longer, but I'm going to leave
those motivators aside. While I believe that the failure of law will
almost certainly result in a compensating re-emergence of ethics as
the ordering template of society, this is a belief I don't have room
to support here. <p>

Instead, I think that, as in the case cited above, compensation for
soft products will be driven primarily by practical considerations,
all of them consistent with the true properties of digital
information, where the value lies in it, and how it can be both
manipulated and protected by technology. <p>

While the conundrum remains a conundrum, I can begin to see the
directions from which solutions may emerge, based in part on
broadening those practical solutions that are already in practice. <p>

<H2>Relationship and Its Tools</H2>


I believe one idea is central to understanding liquid commerce:
Information economics, in the absence of objects, will be based more
on relationship than possession. <p>

One existing model for the future conveyance of intellectual property
is real time performance, a medium currently used only in theater,
music, lectures, stand-up comedy and pedagogy.  I believe the concept
of performance will expand to include most of the information economy
from multi-casted soap operas to stock analysis. In these instances,
commercial exchange will be more like ticket sales to a continuous
show than the purchase of discrete bundles of that which is being
shown. <p>

The other model, of course, is service. The entire professional
class--doctors, lawyers, consultants, architects, etc.--are already
being paid directly for their intellectual property. Who needs
copyright when you're on a retainer? <p>

In fact, this model was applied to much of what is now copyrighted
until the late 18th Century. Before the industrialization of creation,
writers, composers, artists, and the like produced their products in
the private service of patrons. Without objects to distribute in a
mass market, creative people will return to a condition somewhat like
this, except that they will serve many patrons, rather than one. <p>

We can already see the emergence of companies that base their
existence on supporting and enhancing the soft property they create
rather than selling it by the shrink-wrapped piece or embedding it in
widgets. <p>

Trip Hawkins' new company for creating and licensing multimedia tools,
3DO, is an example of what I'm talking about. 3DO doesn't intend to
produce any commercial software or consumer devices. Instead, they
will act as a kind of private standards setting body, mediating among
software and device creators who will be their licensees.  They will
provide a point of commonalty for relationships between a broad
spectrum of entities. <p>

In any case, whether you think of yourself as a service provider or a
performer, the future protection of your intellectual property will
depend on your ability to control your relationship to the market--a
relationship that will most likely live and grow over time. <p>

The value of that relationship will reside in the quality of
performance, the uniqueness of your point of view, the validity of
your expertise, its relevance to your market, and, underlying
everything, the ability of that market to access your creative
services swiftly, conveniently, and interactively. <p>

<H2>Interaction and Protection</H2>


Direct interaction will provide a lot of intellectual property
protection in the future, and, indeed, it already has. No one knows
how many software pirates have bought legitimate copies of a program
after calling its publisher for technical support and being asked for
some proof of purchase, but I would guess the number is very high. <p>

The same kind of controls will be applicable to "question and answer"
relationships between authorities (or artists) and those who seek
their expertise. Newsletters, magazines, and books will be
supplemented by the ability of their subscribers to ask direct
questions of authors. <p>

Interactivity will be a billable commodity even without authorship. As
people move into the Net and increasingly get their information
directly from its point of production, unfiltered by centralized
media, they will attempt to develop the same interactive ability to
probe reality which only experience has provided them in the past.
Live access to these distant "eyes and ears" will be much easier to
cordon than access to static bundles of stored but easily reproducible
information. <p>

In most cases, control will be based on restricting access to the
freshest, highest bandwidth information. It will be a matter of
defining the ticket, the venue, the performer, and the identity of the
ticket holder, definitions that I believe will take their forms from
technology, not law. <p>

In most cases, the defining technology will be cryptography. <p>

<H2>Crypto Bottling</H2>


Cryptography, as I've said perhaps too many times, is the "material"
from which the walls, boundaries--and bottles--of Cyberspace will be
fashioned. <p>

Of course there are problems with cryptography or any other purely
technical method of property protection. It has always appeared to me
that the more security you hide your goods behind, the more likely you
are to turn your sanctuary into a target. Having come from a place
where people leave their keys in their cars and don't even have keys
to their houses, I remain convinced that the best obstacle to crime is
a society with its ethics intact. <p>

While I admit that this is not the kind of society most of us live in,
I also believe that a social over-reliance on protection by barricades
rather than conscience will eventually wither the latter by turning
intrusion and theft into a sport, rather than a crime. This is already
occurring in the digital domain as is evident in the activities of
computer crackers. <p>

Furthermore, I would argue that initial efforts to protect digital
copyright by copy protection contributed to the current condition in
which most otherwise ethical computer users seem morally untroubled by
their possession of pirated software. <p>

Instead of cultivating among the newly computerized a sense of respect
for the work of their fellows, early reliance on copy protection led
to the subliminal notion that cracking into a software package somehow
"earned" one the right to use it. Limited not by conscience but by
technical skill, many soon felt free to do whatever they could get
away with. This will continue to be a potential liability of the
encryption of digitized commerce. <p>

Furthermore, it's cautionary to remember that copy protection was
rejected by the market in most areas. Many of the upcoming efforts to
use cryptography-based protection schemes will probably suffer the
same fate. People are not going to tolerate much which makes computers
harder to use than they already are without any benefit to the user. <p>

Nevertheless, encryption has already demonstrated a certain blunt
utility. New subscriptions to various commercial satellite TV services
sky-rocketed recently after their deployment of more robust encryption
of their feeds. This, despite a booming backwoods trade in black
decoder chips conducted by folks who'd look more at home running
moonshine than cracking code. <p>

Another obvious problem with encryption as a global solution is that
once something has been unscrambled by a legitimate licensee, it may
be openly available to massive reproduction. <p>

In some instances, reproduction following decryption may not be a
problem. Many soft products degrade sharply in value with time. It may
be that the only real interest in some such products will be among
those who have purchased the keys to immediacy. <p>

Furthermore, as software becomes more modular and distribution moves
online, it will begin to metamorphose in direct interaction with its
user base. Discontinuous upgrades will smooth into a constant process
of incremental improvement and adaptation, some of it man-made and
some of it arising through genetic algorithms. Pirated copies of
software may become too static to have much value to anyone. <p>

Even in cases such as images, where the information is expected to
remain fixed, the unencrypted file could still be interwoven with code
which could continue to protect it by a wide variety of means. <p>

In most of the schemes I can project, the file would be "alive" with
permanently embedded software that could "sense" the surrounding
conditions and interact with them, For example, it might contain code
that could detect the process of duplication and cause it to
self-destruct. <p>

Other methods might give the file the ability to "phone home" through
the Net to its original owner. The continued integrity of some files
might require periodic "feeding" with digital cash from their host,
which they would then relay back to their authors. <p>

Of course files that possess the independent ability to communicate
upstream sound uncomfortably like the Morris Internet Worm. "Live"
files do have a certain viral quality.  And serious privacy issues
would arise if everyone's computer were packed with digital spies. <p>

The point is that cryptography will enable a lot of protection
technologies that will develop rapidly in the obsessive competition
that has always existed between lock- makers and lock-breakers. <p>

But cryptography will not be used simply for making locks. It is also
at the heart of both digital signatures and the afore-mentioned
digital cash, both of which I believe will be central to the future
protection of intellectual property. <p>

I believe that the generally acknowledged failure of the shareware
model in software had less to do with dishonesty than with the simple
inconvenience of paying for shareware. If the payment process can be
automated, as digital cash and signature will make possible, I believe
that soft product creators will reap a much higher return from the
bread they cast upon the waters of Cyberspace. <p>

Moreover, they will be spared much of the overhead that presently
adheres to the marketing, manufacture, sales, and distribution of
information products, whether those products are computer programs,
books, CD's, or motion pictures. This will reduce prices and further
increase the likelihood of non-compulsory payment. <p>

But of course there is a fundamental problem with a system that
requires, through technology, payment for every access to a particular
expression. It defeats the original Jeffersonian purpose of seeing
that ideas were available to everyone regardless of their economic
station. I am not comfortable with a model that will restrict inquiry
to the wealthy. <p>

<H2>An Economy of Verbs</H2>

The future forms and protections of intellectual property are densely
obscured from the entrance to the Virtual Age. Nevertheless, I can
make (or reiterate) a few flat statements that I earnestly believe
won't look too silly in fifty years. <p>

<UL>
<LI> In the absence of the old containers, almost everything we
think we know about intellectual property is wrong. We are going to
have to unlearn it. We are going to have to look at information as
though we'd never seen the stuff before. <p>

<LI> The protections that we will develop will rely far more on
ethics and technology than on law. <p>

<LI> Encryption will be the technical basis for most intellectual
property protection. (And should, for this and other reasons, be made
more widely available.) <p>

<LI> The economy of the future will be based on relationship rather
than possession. It will be continuous rather than sequential. <p>
</UL>

And finally, in the years to come, most human exchange will be virtual
rather than physical, consisting not of stuff but the stuff of which
dreams are made. Our future business will be conducted in a world made
more of verbs than nouns. <p>

<TITLE>Notes on key escrow meeting with NSA and Bell Labs</TITLE>
<H1>Notes on key escrow meeting with NSA and Bell Labs</H1>

Date: Wed, 02 Feb 94 16:10:26 -0500
<BR> From: Matt Blaze &lt;mab@research.att.com&gt; <p>

A group from NSA and FBI met the other day with a group of us at Bell
Labs to discuss the key escrow proposal.  They were surprisingly
forthcoming and open to discussion and debate, and were willing to at
least listen to hard questions.  They didn't object when asked if we
could summarize what we learned to the net.  Incidentally, the people
at the meeting seemed to base a large part of their understanding of
public opinion on Usenet postings.  Postings to sci.crypt and
talk.politics.crypto seem to actually have an influence on our
government. <p>

A number of things came out at the meeting that we didn't previously
know or that clarified previously released information.  What follows
is a rough summary; needless to say, nothing here should be taken as
gospel, or representing the official positions of anybody.  Also,
nothing here should be taken as an endorsement of key escrow, clipper,
or anything else by the authors; we're just reporting.  These notes
are based on the collective memory of Steve Bellovin, Matt Blaze, Jack
Lacy, and Mike Reiter; there may be errors or misunderstandings.
Please forgive the rough style.  Note also the use of "~ ~" for
'approximate quotes' (a marvelous Whit Diffie-ism). <p>

NSA's stated goals and motives for all this:
<UL>
<LI> DES is at the end of its useful life
<LI> Sensitive, unclassified government data needs protection
<LI> This should be made available to US Citizens
<LI> US business data abroad especially needs protection
<LI> The new technology should not preclude law enforcement access
</UL> <p>

They indicated that the thinking was not that criminals would use key
escrowed crypto, but that they should not field a system that
criminals could easily use against them.  The existence of key escrow
would deter them from using crypto in the first place.  The FBI
representative said that they expect to catch "~only the stupid
criminals~" through the escrow system. <p>

Another stated reason for key escrow is that they do not think that
even government-spec crypto devices can be kept physically secure.
They do expect enough to be diverted to the black market that they feel
they need a response.  NSA's emphasis was on the foreign black market... <p>

There seems to be a desire to manipulate the market, by having the
fixed cost of key escrow cryptography amortized over the government
market.  Any private sector devices would have to sell a much larger
number of units to compete on price.  (This was somewhere between an
implication and an explicit statement on their part.) <p>

When asked about cryptography in software, "~...if you want US
government cryptography, you must do it with hardware~". <p>

Clipper chips should be available (to product vendors) in June.  You
can't just buy loose chips - they have to be installed in approved
products.  Your application interface has to be approved by NIST for
you to get your hands on the chips. <p>

An interesting point came up about the reverse-engineering resistance
of the chips: they are designed to resist reverse engineering the data
in the chip without destroying the chip.  It is not clear (from the
information presented at the meeting) whether the chips are equally
resistant to destructive reverse-engineering to learn the skipjack
algorithm.   They said the algorithm was patented, but they may have
been joking.  ("~And if that doesn't scare you enough, we'll turn the
patent over to PKP.~") <p>

The resistance to reverse engineering is not considered absolute by
NSA.  They do feel that "~it would require the resources of a national
laboratory, and anyone with that much money can design their own
cryptosystem that's just as strong.~" <p>

They repeated several times that there are "~no plans to regulate the
use of alternate encryption within the US by US citizens.~"  They also
indicated they "~weren't naive~" and didn't think that they could if
they wanted to. <p>

There were 919 authorized wiretaps, and 10,000 pen register monitors,
in 1992.  They do not have any figures yet on how often cryptography
was used to frustrate wiretaps. <p>

They do not yet have a production version of the "decoder" box used by
law enforcement.  Initially, the family key will be split (by the same
XOR method) and handled by two different people in the athorized
agencies.  There is presently only one family key.  The specifications
of the escrow exploitation mechanism are not yet final, either; they
are considering the possibility of having the central site strip off
the outer layers of encryption, and only sending the session key back
to the decoder box. <p>

The escrow authorities will NOT require presentation of a court order
prior to releasing the keys.  Instead, the agency will fill out a form
certifying that they have a legal authorization.  This is also backed
up with a separate confirmation from the prosecutor's office.  The
escrow agencies will supply any key requested and will not themselves
verify that the keys requested are associated with the particular court
order. <p>

The NSA did not answer a question as to whether the national security
community would obtain keys from the same escrow mechanism for their
(legally authorized) intelligence gathering or whether some other
mechanism would exist for them to get the keys. <p>

The masks for the Clipper/Capstone chip are unclassified (but are
protected by trade secret) and the chips can be produced in an
unclassified foundry.  Part of the programming in the secure vault
includes "~installing part of the Skipjack algorithm.~" Later
discussion indicated that the part of the algorithm installed in the
secure vault are the "S-tables", suggesting that perhaps unprogrammed
Clipper chips can be programmed to implement other 80-bit key, 32 round
ciphers. <p>

The Capstone chip includes an ARM-6 RISC processor that can be used for
other things when no cryptographic functions are performed.  In
particular, it can be used by vendors as their own on-board processor.
The I/O to the processor is shut off when a crypto operation is in
progress. <p>

They passed around a Tessera PCMCIA (type 1) card.  These cards
contain a Capstone chip and can be used by general purpose PC
applications.  The cards themselves might not be export controlled.
(Unfortunately, they took the sample card back with them...)  The card
will digitally sign a challenge from the host, so you can't substitute
a bogus card.  The cards have non-volatile onboard storage for users'
secret keys and for the public keys of a certifying authority. <p>

They are building a library/API for Tessera, called Catapult, that
will provide an interface suitable for many different applications.
They have prototype email and ftp applications that already uses it.
They intend to eventually give away source code for this library.
They responded favorably to the suggestion that they put it up for
anonymous ftp. <p>

Applications (which can use the library and which the NSA approves for
government use) will be responsible for managing the LEAF field.  Note
that they intend to apply key escrowed Skipjack to other applications,
including mail and file encryption.  The LEAF would be included in
such places as the mail header or the file attributes.  This implies
that it is possible to omit sending the LEAF -- but the decrypt chip
won't work right if it doesn't get one. <p>

When asked, they indicated that it might be possible wire up a pair of
Clipper/Capstone chips to not transmit the LEAF field, but that the
way to do this is "~not obvious from the interface we give you~" and
"~you'd have to be careful not to make mistakes~".  They gave a lot of
attention to obvious ways to get around the LEAF. <p>

The unit key is generated via Skipjack itself, from random seeds
provided by the two escrow agencies (approximately monthly, though
that isn't certain yet).  They say they prefer a software generation
process because its correct behavior is auditable. <p>

Capstone (but not Clipper) could be configured to allow independent
loading of the two key halves, in separate facilities.  "~It's your
money [meaning American taxpayers].~" <p>

The LEAF field contains 80 bits for the traffic key, encrypted via the
unit key in "~a unique mode &lt;grin&gt;~", 32 bits for the unit id, and a 16
bit checksum of some sort.  (We didn't waste our breath asking what the
checksum algorithm was.)  This is all encrypted under the family key
using "~another mode &lt;grin&gt;~". <p>

They expressed a great deal of willingness to make any sort of
reasonable changes that vendors needed for their products.  They are
trying <I>very</I> hard to get Skipjack and key escrow into lots of
products. <p>

THE WHITE HOUSE
OFFICE OF THE VICE PRESIDENT <p>

EMBARGOED UNTIL, 3: 00 PM EST             CONTACT: 202/456-7035
February 4, 1994 <p>

STATEMENT OF THE VICE PRESIDENT <p>

Today's announcements on encryption represent important steps in
the implementation of the Administration's policy on this critical
issue. Our policy is designed to provide better encryption to
individuals and businesses while ensuring that the needs of law
enforcement and national security are met. <p>

Encryption is a law and order issue since it can be used by criminals
to thwart wiretaps and avoid detection and prosecution. It also has
huge strategic value. Encryption technology and cryptoanalysis
turned the tide in the Pacific and elsewhere during World War II. <p>

[end of statement] <p>

Statement of
Dr. Martha Harris
Deputy Assistant Secretary of State
for Political-Military Affairs
February 4, 1994 <p>

Encryption -- Export Control Reform <p>

The Secretary of State is announcing today measures arising from
the Administration's decision to reform export control procedures
applicable to products incorporating encryption technology. These
reforms are part of the Administration's effort to eliminate
unnecessary controls and ensure efficient implementation. The
reforms will simplify encryption product export licensing and
speed the review of encryption product exports, thus helping U.S.
manufacturers to compete more effectively in the global market.
While there will be no changes in the types of equipment
controlled by the Munitions List, we are announcing measures to
expedite licensing. <p>

Last year the President announced an initiative to encourage U.S.
manufacturers and users of encryption to take advantage of a
government technology (the key-escrow chip) that provides
excellent security while ensuring that the Government has a means
to decode the encryption when lawfully authorized, such as when
executing a court-authorized warrant in connection with a criminal
investigation. At the time he announced this initiative, the
President directed a comprehensive review of U.S. policy regarding
domestic use and export of encryption technology. The reforms we
are announcing today result from that review. <p>

The President has determined that vital U.S. national security and
law enforcement interests compel maintaining appropriate control
of encryption. Still, there is much that can be done to reform
existing controls to ensure that they are efficiently implemented
and to maintain U.S. leadership in the world market for encryption
technology. Accordingly, the President has asked the Secretary of
State to take immediate action to implement a number of procedural
reforms. The reforms are: <p>

* License Reform: Under new licensing arrangements, encryption
manufacturers will be able to ship their products from the United
States directly to customers within approved regions without
obtaining individual licenses for each end user. This will improve
the ability of our manufacturers to provide expedited delivery of
products, and to reduce shipping and tracking costs. It should
also reduce the number of individual license requests, especially
for small businesses that cannot afford international
distributors. <p>

* Rapid review of export license applications: A significant
number of encryption export license applications can be reviewed
more quickly. For such exports, we have set a license turnaround
goal of two working days. <p>

* Personal use exemption: We will no longer require that U.S.
citizens obtain an export license prior to taking encryption
products out of the U.S. temporarily for their own personal use.
In the past, this requirement caused delays and inconvenience for
business travellers. <p>

* Allow exports of key-escrow encryption: After initial review,
key-escrow encryption products may now be exported to most end
users. Additionally, key-escrow products will qualify for special
licensing arrangements. <p>

These reforms should have the effect of minimizing the impact of
export controls on U.S. industry. The Department of State will
take all appropriate actions to ensure that these reforms are
implemented as quickly as possible. The Secretary of State asks
that encryption product manufacturers evaluate the impact of these
reforms over the next year and provide feedback both on how the
reforms have worked out and on recommendations for additional
procedural reforms. <p>

The contact point for further information on these reforms is Rose
Biancaniello, Office of Defense Trade Controls, Bureau of
Political-Military Affairs, Department of State, (703) 875-6644. <p>

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE
CLINTON ADMINISTRATION'S ENCRYPTION POLICY <p>

Q.      What were the findings of the encryption technology review? <p>

A.      The review confirmed that sound encryption technology is
needed to help ensure that digital information in both computer
and telecommunications systems is protected against unauthorized
disclosure or tampering. It also verified the importance of
preserving the ability of law enforcement to understand encrypted
communications when conducting authorized wiretaps. Key escrow
technology meets these objectives. <p>

Specific decisions were made to enable federal agencies and the
private sector to use the key escrow technology on a voluntary
basis and to allow the export of key escrow encryption products. <p>

In addition, the Department of State will streamline export
licensing procedures for products that can be exported under
current regulations in order to help U.S. companies to sell their
products abroad. <p>

To meet the critical need for ways to verify the author and sender
of an electronic message -- something that is crucial to business
applications for the National Information Infrastructure -- the
federal government is committed to ensuring the availability of a
royalty-free, public-domain Digital Signature Standard. <p>

Finally, an interagency working group has been established to
continue to address these issues and to maintain a dialogue with
industry and public interest groups. <p>

Q.       Who has been consulted during this review? The Congress?
Industry? What mechanism is there for continuing consultation? <p>

A.       Following the President's directive announced on April 16,
1993, extensive discussions have been held with Congress,
industry, and privacy rights groups on encryption issues. Formal
public comment was solicited on the Escrowed Encryption Standard
and on a wide variety of issues related to the review through the
Computer System Security and Privacy Advisory Board. <p>

The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy and the
National Security Council will chair the interagency working
group. The group will seek input from the private sector both
informally and through several existing advisory committees. It
also will work closely with the Information Policy Committee of
the Information Infrastructure Task Force, which is responsible
for coordinating Administration telecommunications and information
policy. <p>

Q.      If national security and law enforcement interests require
continued export controls of encryption, what specific benefits
can U.S. encryption manufacturers expect? <p>

A.      The reforms will simplify encryption product export licensing
and speed the review of encryption product exports. Among other
benefits, manufacturers should see expedited delivery of products,
reduced shipping and reporting costs, and fewer individual license
requests -- especially for small businesses that cannot afford
international distributors. A personal exemption for business
travellers using encryption products will eliminate delays and
inconvenience when they want to take encryption products out of
the U.S. temporarily. <p>

Q.      Why is the key escrow standard being adopted? <p>

A.      The key escrow mechanism will provide Americans and
government agencies with encryption products that are more secure,
more convenient, and less expensive than others readily available
today -- while at the same time meeting the legitimate needs of
law enforcement. <p>

Q.      Will the standard be mandatory? <p>

A.      No. The Administration has repeatedly stressed that the key
escrow technology, and this standard, is for voluntary use by
federal and other government agencies and by the private sector.
The standard that is being issued only applies to federal agencies
-- and it is voluntary. <p>

Does this approach expand the authority of government agencies to
listen in on phone conversations? <p>

No Key escrow technology provides government agencies with no
[sic] new authorities to access the content of the private
conversations of Americans. <p>

Q.      Will the devices be exportable? Will other devices that use
the government hardware? <p>

A.      Yes. After an initial review of the product, the State
Department will permit the export of devices incorporating key
escrow technology to most end users. One of the attractions of
this technology is the protection it can give to U.S. companies
operating at home and abroad. <p>

Q.      Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on a
drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation encrypted using
the device. What would they have to do to decipher the message? <p>

A.      They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a
court order, to do the wiretap in the first place. They would then
present documentation, including a certification of this
authorization, to the two entities responsible for safeguarding
the keys. (The key is split into component parts, which are stored
separately in order to ensure the security of the key escrow
system.) They then obtain the components for the keys for the
device being used by the drug smugglers. The components are then
combined and the message can be read. <p>

Q.      Who will hold the escrowed keys? <p>

A.      The Attorney General has selected two U.S. agencies to hold
the escrowed key components: the Treasury Department's Automated
Systems Division and the Commerce Department's National Institute
of Standards and Technology. <p>

Q.      How strong is the security in the device? How can I be sure
how strong the security is? <p>

A.      This system is more secure than many other voice encryption
system readily available today. While the algorithm upon which the
Escrowed Encryption Standard is based will remain classified to
protect the security of the system, an independent panel of
cryptography experts found that the algorithm provides significant
protection. In fact, the panel concluded that it will be 36 years
until the cost of breaking the algorithm will be equal to the cost
of breaking the current Data Encryption Standard now being used. <p>

Q.      Is there a "trap door" that would allow unauthorized access
to the keys? <p>

A.      No. There is no trapdoor. <p>

Q.      Whose decision was it to propose this product? <p>

A.      The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the
Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in this
decision. The approach has been endorsed by the President, the
Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet officials. <p>

Synopsis:  PGP uses public-key encryption to protect E-mail and data
files.  Communicate securely with people you've never met, with no
secure channels needed for prior exchange of keys.  PGP is well
featured and fast, with sophisticated key management, digital
signatures, data compression, and good ergonomic design. <p>

"Legal Issues" section in the "PGP User's Guide, Volume II: Special
Topics". <p>

Quick Overview
============= <p>

Pretty Good(tm) Privacy (PGP), from Phil's Pretty Good Software, is a
high security cryptographic software application for MSDOS, Unix,
VAX/VMS, and other computers.  PGP allows people to exchange files or
messages with privacy, authentication, and convenience.  Privacy
means that only those intended to receive a message can read it. 
Authentication means that messages that appear to be from a
particular person can only have originated from that person. 
Convenience means that privacy and authentication are provided
without the hassles of managing keys associated with conventional
cryptographic software.  No secure channels are needed to exchange
keys between users, which makes PGP much easier to use.  This is
because PGP is based on a powerful new technology called "public key"
cryptography.   <p>

PGP combines the convenience of the Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA)
public key cryptosystem with the speed of conventional cryptography,
message digests for digital signatures, data compression before
encryption, good ergonomic design, and sophisticated key management. 
And PGP performs the public-key functions faster than most other
software implementations.  PGP is public key cryptography for the
masses. <p>

PGP does not provide any built-in modem communications capability. 
You must use a separate software product for that. <p>

This document, "Volume I: Essential Topics", only explains the
essential concepts for using PGP, and should be read by all PGP
users.  "Volume II: Special Topics" covers the advanced features of
PGP and other special topics, and may be read by more serious PGP
users.  Neither volume explains the underlying technology details of
cryptographic algorithms and data structures.   <p>

Why Do You Need PGP?
==================== <p>

It's personal.  It's private.  And it's no one's business but yours.
You may be planning a political campaign, discussing your taxes, or
having an illicit affair.  Or you may be doing something that you
feel shouldn't be illegal, but is.  Whatever it is, you don't want
your private electronic mail (E-mail) or confidential documents read
by anyone else.  There's nothing wrong with asserting your privacy. 
Privacy is as apple-pie as the Constitution.   <p>

Perhaps you think your E-mail is legitimate enough that encryption is
unwarranted.  If you really are a law-abiding citizen with nothing to
hide, then why don't you always send your paper mail on postcards? 
Why not submit to drug testing on demand?  Why require a warrant for
police searches of your house?  Are you trying to hide something? 
You must be a subversive or a drug dealer if you hide your mail
inside envelopes.  Or maybe a paranoid nut.  Do law-abiding citizens
have any need to encrypt their E-mail? <p>

What if everyone believed that law-abiding citizens should use
postcards for their mail?  If some brave soul tried to assert his
privacy by using an envelope for his mail, it would draw suspicion. 
Perhaps the authorities would open his mail to see what he's hiding. 
Fortunately, we don't live in that kind of world, because everyone
protects most of their mail with envelopes.  So no one draws suspicion
by asserting their privacy with an envelope.  There's safety in
numbers.  Analogously, it would be nice if everyone routinely used
encryption for all their E-mail, innocent or not, so that no one drew
suspicion by asserting their E-mail privacy with encryption.  Think
of it as a form of solidarity. <p>

Today, if the Government wants to violate the privacy of ordinary
citizens, it has to expend a certain amount of expense and labor to
intercept and steam open and read paper mail, and listen to and
possibly transcribe spoken telephone conversation.  This kind of
labor-intensive monitoring is not practical on a large scale.  This
is only done in important cases when it seems worthwhile.  <p>

More and more of our private communications are being routed through
electronic channels.  Electronic mail is gradually replacing
conventional paper mail.  E-mail messages are just too easy to
intercept and scan for interesting keywords.  This can be done
easily, routinely, automatically, and undetectably on a grand scale. 
International cablegrams are already scanned this way on a large
scale by the NSA.  <p>

We are moving toward a future when the nation will be crisscrossed
with high capacity fiber optic data networks linking together all our
increasingly ubiquitous personal computers.  E-mail will be the norm
for everyone, not the novelty it is today.  The Government will
protect our E-mail with Government-designed encryption protocols. 
Probably most people will trust that.  But perhaps some people will
prefer their own protective measures. <p>

Senate Bill 266, a 1991 omnibus anti-crime bill, had an unsettling
measure buried in it.  If this non-binding resolution had become real
law, it would have forced manufacturers of secure communications
equipment to insert special "trap doors" in their products, so that
the Government can read anyone's encrypted messages.  It reads:  "It
is the sense of Congress that providers of electronic communications
services and manufacturers of electronic communications service
equipment shall insure that communications systems permit the
Government to obtain the plain text contents of voice, data, and
other communications when appropriately authorized by law."  This
measure was defeated after rigorous protest from civil libertarians
and industry groups.   <p>

In 1992, the FBI Digital Telephony wiretap proposal was introduced to
Congress.  It would require all manufacturers of communications
equipment to build in special remote wiretap ports that would enable
the FBI to remotely wiretap all forms of electronic communication
from FBI offices.  Although it never attracted any sponsors in
Congress because of citizen opposition, it will be reintroduced in
1993.   <p>

Most alarming of all is the White House's bold new encryption policy
initiative, under development at NSA for four years, and unveiled
April 16th, 1993.  The centerpiece of this initiative is a
Government-built encryption device, called the "Clipper" chip,
containing a new classified NSA encryption algorithm.  The Government
is encouraging private industry to design it into all their secure
communication products, like secure phones, secure FAX, etc.  AT&amp;T is
now putting the Clipper into all their secure voice products.  The
catch:  At the time of manufacture, each Clipper chip will be loaded
with its own unique key, and the Government gets to keep a copy,
placed in escrow.  Not to worry, though-- the Government promises
that they will use these keys to read your traffic only when duly
authorized by law.  Of course, to make Clipper completely effective,
the next logical step would be to outlaw other forms of cryptography. <p>

If privacy is outlawed, only outlaws will have privacy.  Intelligence
agencies have access to good cryptographic technology.  So do the big
arms and drug traffickers.  So do defense contractors, oil companies,
and other corporate giants.  But ordinary people and grassroots
political organizations mostly have not had access to affordable
"military grade" public-key cryptographic technology.  Until now. <p>

PGP empowers people to take their privacy into their own hands.  
There's a growing social need for it.  That's why I wrote it. <p>

How it Works
============ <p>

It would help if you were already familiar with the concept of
cryptography in general and public key cryptography in particular. 
Nonetheless, here are a few introductory remarks about public key
cryptography. <p>

First, some elementary terminology.  Suppose I want to send you a
message, but I don't want anyone but you to be able to read it.  I
can "encrypt", or "encipher" the message, which means I scramble it
up in a hopelessly complicated way, rendering it unreadable to anyone
except you, the intended recipient of the message.  I supply a
cryptographic "key" to encrypt the message, and you have to use the
same key to decipher or "decrypt" it.  At least that's how it works
in conventional "single-key" cryptosystems. <p>

In conventional cryptosystems, such as the US Federal Data Encryption
Standard (DES), a single key is used for both encryption and
decryption.  This means that a key must be initially transmitted via
secure channels so that both parties can know it before encrypted
messages can be sent over insecure channels.  This may be
inconvenient.  If you have a secure channel for exchanging keys, then
why do you need cryptography in the first place? <p>

In public key cryptosystems, everyone has two related complementary
keys, a publicly revealed key and a secret key.  Each key unlocks the
code that the other key makes.  Knowing the public key does not help
you deduce the corresponding secret key.  The public key can be
published and widely disseminated across a communications network.
This protocol provides privacy without the need for the same kind of
secure channels that a conventional cryptosystem requires. <p>

Anyone can use a recipient's public key to encrypt a message to that
person, and that recipient uses her own corresponding secret key to
decrypt that message.  No one but the recipient can decrypt it,
because no one else has access to that secret key.  Not even the
person who encrypted the message can decrypt it.   <p>

Message authentication is also provided.  The sender's own secret key
can be used to encrypt a message, thereby "signing" it.  This creates
a digital signature of a message, which the recipient (or anyone
else) can check by using the sender's public key to decrypt it.  This
proves that the sender was the true originator of the message, and
that the message has not been subsequently altered by anyone else,
because the sender alone possesses the secret key that made that
signature.  Forgery of a signed message is infeasible, and the sender
cannot later disavow his signature.  <p>

These two processes can be combined to provide both privacy and
authentication by first signing a message with your own secret key,
then encrypting the signed message with the recipient's public key. 
The recipient reverses these steps by first decrypting the message
with her own secret key, then checking the enclosed signature with
your public key.  These steps are done automatically by the
recipient's software. <p>

Because the public key encryption algorithm is much slower than
conventional single-key encryption, encryption is better accomplished
by using a high-quality fast conventional single-key encryption
algorithm to encipher the message.  This original unenciphered
message is called "plaintext".  In a process invisible to the user, a
temporary random key, created just for this one "session", is used to
conventionally encipher the plaintext file.  Then the recipient's
public key is used to encipher this temporary random conventional
key.  This public-key-enciphered conventional "session" key is sent
along with the enciphered text (called "ciphertext") to the
recipient.  The recipient uses her own secret key to recover this
temporary session key, and then uses that key to run the fast
conventional single-key algorithm to decipher the large ciphertext 
message. <p>

Public keys are kept in individual "key certificates" that include
the key owner's user ID (which is that person's name), a timestamp of
when the key pair was generated, and the actual key material.  Public
key certificates contain the public key material, while secret key
certificates contain the secret key material.  Each secret key is
also encrypted with its own password, in case it gets stolen.  A key
file, or "key ring" contains one or more of these key certificates. 
Public key rings contain public key certificates, and secret key
rings contain secret key certificates.   <p>

The keys are also internally referenced by a "key ID", which is an 
"abbreviation" of the public key (the least significant 64 bits of 
the large public key).  When this key ID is displayed, only the lower
24 bits are shown for further brevity.  While many keys may share the
same user ID, for all practical purposes no two keys share the same
key ID.   <p>

PGP uses "message digests" to form signatures.  A message digest is a
128-bit cryptographically strong one-way hash function of the
message.  It is somewhat analogous to a "checksum" or CRC error
checking code, in that it compactly "represents" the message and is
used to detect changes in the message.  Unlike a CRC, however, it is
computationally infeasible for an attacker to devise a substitute
message that would produce an identical message digest.  The message
digest gets encrypted by the secret key to form a signature.   <p>

Documents are signed by prefixing them with signature certificates,
which contain the key ID of the key that was used to sign it, a
secret-key-signed message digest of the document, and a timestamp of
when the signature was made.  The key ID is used by the receiver to
look up the sender's public key to check the signature.  The
receiver's software automatically looks up the sender's public key
and user ID in the receiver's public key ring. <p>

Encrypted files are prefixed by the key ID of the public key used to
encrypt them.  The receiver uses this key ID message prefix to look
up the secret key needed to decrypt the message.  The receiver's 
software automatically looks up the necessary secret decryption key 
in the receiver's secret key ring. <p>

These two types of key rings are the principal method of storing and
managing public and secret keys.  Rather than keep individual keys in
separate key files, they are collected in key rings to facilitate the
automatic lookup of keys either by key ID or by user ID.  Each user
keeps his own pair of key rings.  An individual public key is
temporarily kept in a separate file long enough to send to your
friend who will then add it to her key ring. <p>

Admin. names escrow agents, no compromise on Clipper - 7 files <p>

EFF Press Release            04/04/94             * DISTRIBUTE WIDELY * <p>

At two briefings, Feb. 4, 1994, the Clinton Administration and various
agencies gave statements before a Congressional committee, and later
representatives of civil liberties organizations, industry spokespersons
and privacy advocates.  The Electronic Frontier Foundation's position,
based on what we have seen and heard from the Administration today, is
that the White House is set on a course that pursues Cold War national
security and law enforcement interests to the detriment of individual
privacy and civil liberties. <p>

The news is grim.  The Administration is: <p>

<UL>
<LI> not backing down on Clipper
<LI> not backing down on key escrow
<LI> not backing down on selection of escrow agents
<LI> already adamant on escrowed key access procedures
<LI> not willing to elminate ITAR restrictions
<LI> hiding behind exaggerated threats of "drug dealers" and "terrorists"
</UL> <p>

The material released to the industry and advocacy version of the briefing
have been placed online at ftp.eff.org (long before their online
availability from goverment access sites, one might add).  See below for
specific details. <p>

No information regarding the Congressional committee version of the briefing
has been announced.  EFF Director Jerry Berman, who attended the private
sector meeting, reported the following: <p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
"The White House and other officials briefed industry on its Clipper chip
and encryption review. While the review is not yet complete, they have
reached several policy conclusions.  First, Clipper will be proposed as
a new Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) next Wednesday. [Feb.
9]  It will be "vountary" for government agencies and the private sector
to use. They are actively asking other vendors to jump in to make the
market a Clipper market. Export licensing processes will be speeded up but
export restrictions will not be lifted in the interests of national
security. The reason was stated bluntly at the briefing : to frustrate
competition with clipper by other powerful encryption schemes by making
them  difficult to market, and to "prevent" strong encryption from leaving
the country thus supposedly making the job of law enforcement and
intelligence more difficult.  Again in the interest of national security. Of
course, Clipper will be exportable but they would not comment on how other
governments will view this.  Treasury and NIST will be the escrow agents
and Justice asserted that there was no necessity for legislation to
implement the escrow procedures. <p>

"I asked if there would be a report to explain the rationale for choosing
these results - we have no explanation of the Administration's thinking, or
any brief in support of the results. They replied that there would be no
report because they have been unable to write one, due to the complexity of
the issue. <p>

"One Administation spokesperson said this was the Bosnia of
Telecommunications. I asked, if this was so, how, in the absense of some
policy explanation, could we know if our policy here will be as successful
as our policy in Bosnia?"
</BLOCKQUOTE> <p>

Clipper and balance <p>

As editor of Interesting People (boy I gave myself a title), I am happy to
present well thought out positions from all sides of the argument.  I
believe this is a critical issue for the future of our country and would
sincerely solicit views (even and especially ones I may not personally
agree with). <p>

By the way, my Computers, Ethics and Society course at Penn this term is
using the Clipper issue to explore  the ethical, legal and economic aspects
of this one aspect of the impact of technology on our nation. We are
maintaining a Mosiac (WWW) set of all the literature we gather and papers
that will be writen. If you have anything that you would like to contribute
send it to mengwong@sas.upenn.edu (Meng Weng Wong). If you would like to

From Brock N. Meeks R.I.P -- Privacy '94 <p>

copyright 1994
CyberWire
Brock N. Meeks <p>

Jacking in from a Non-Government Approved Encryption Port: <p>

Washington, DC --  The Clinton Administration today gang raped your
privacy. <p>

The White House Friday announced its endorsement of a sweeping new
security and privacy initiative.  Privacy, as we know it, will
never be the same. All the rules have changed.  Forever.  The catch
is that the government gets to write all the rules;  you get no
vote.  None.  Worse, you can't even read the fucking rule book
because it's classified. <p>

The initiative involves the creation of "new products to accelerate
the development and use of advanced and secure telecommunications
networks and wireless telecommunications links," the White House
said.  In English:  Law enforcement and intelligence agencies now
have an easy way to fuck with any and all forms of spoken or
electronically transmitted communications. <p>

The policy is voluntary, of course.  You don't have to sign on to
it.  You don't have to use government approved encryption devices.
But if you plan to do any business with the government, you'll have
to use them.  And if the government gets its way, well, you'll end
using them whether you want to or not.  You'll have no choice (are
you sensing a trend here?). All telephones, computers, fax
machines, modems, etc. will come "wiretap ready."  It will be the
de facto standard. <p>

If you don't use the government standard, you'll be branding
yourself a CryptoRebel.  Big fucking deal?  Maybe, maybe not.  But
think for a second. Perhaps some agency will be able to check your
"crypto-approval rating." Perhaps those favorable bank loans,
mortgage rates or low insurance premiums will only go to those with
high crypto-approval ratings. <p>

But the White House is adamant about making sure you understand
this whole damn thing is voluntary.  And don't let anything sway
you from believing that, not even the White House backgrounder
materials that say no U.S. citizen "as a matter of right, is
entitled to an unbreakable commercial encryption product." <p>

Just use the "balanced" approach of the government system, where in
this case the "breakability" of the encryption belongs only with
them. Everything will work out fine.  Just listen:  "Encryption is
a law and order issue since it can be use by criminals to thwart
wiretaps and avoid detection and prosecution," said Vice President
Gore.  "Our policy is designed to provide better encryption to
individuals and businesses while ensuring that the needs of law
enforcement and national security are met." <p>

The Administration won't tell you exactly why they expect you
simply hand over all your privacy safeguards to them.  "Listen, if
you knew what we knew about criminal activity, this issue wouldn't
even be debated," said Mike Nelson with the Office of Science and
Technology Policy and co-chair of the Working Group on Data
Security, a newly created interagency task force. <p>

Chicken or the Egg?
================== <p>

The new policy was hatched in the super-secret recesses of the
National Security Agency (NSA).  And while Clinton was still trying
to find the instruction manual for his White House telephone
system, the NSA, FBI and other assorted agencies shoved their ideas
onto the National Security Council table.  Before the
Administration could blink, it found itself in the unenviable
position of having backed a severely flawed security policy that
has compromised the privacy of every U.S. citizen and drawn the ire
of every civil liberties in the country. <p>

But the White House quickly put the breaks on, calling for a full
scale, government wide "review" of its security and privacy
policies. It gave privacy advocacy groups some breathing room.
Surely the Administration, once it had a chance to actually study
this damn thing, would see it through it. <p>

But the White House punted.  The review was a smoke screen.
Instead, it provided momentum inside the Administration.  It was
from this review, ordered last April, that this new initiative
springs. <p>

And when all was said and done, the White House screwed the pooch. <p>

Clipper Sails On
================ <p>

The one trick pony here is the Clipper Chip, a device that can be
installed in virtually any communications device. The chip
scrambles all conversations.  No one can crack the code, expect the
government, of course.  The Feds hold all the keys. Rather, they
hold the only keys that count. <p>

Each Clipper chip is made with 3 unique keys.  All three are needed
to descramble the encrypted messages streaming through them.  But
only the government's keys matter.  The key you get with your
Clipper Chip is essentially the chip's social security number.
You'll never actually see this key, have any idea what its number
is or get your hands on it. If you try to sneak a peak at it, the
damn thing self destructs. Honest. <p>

The other two keys will be held in electronic vaults;  fraternal
twins, separated by mandate.  Each of these keys will be held by
government agencies, called "escrow agents."  One will be held by
the National Institute for Standards and Technology, the other by
the Automated Systems Division of the Dept. of Treasury. <p>

When a law enforcement agency, which could be your local sheriff's
department, wants to wiretap a conversation that's been encrypted
by Clipper they apply to each of the escrow agents.  The agents
send their respective key, electronically, to a "black box"
operated by the law enforcement agency.  As encrypted conversations
stream into the box, they come out the back side in nice, neat
sounding vowels and consonants, or in the case of electronic mail,
in plain ol' ASCII. <p>

Yes, all law enforcement agencies need a court approved wiretap
before they can pull this whole scheme off.  This, the
Administration says, is where you're privacy is protected.  "We're
not going to use Clipper to listen in on the American public," said
Raymond Kammer of NIST deputy director.  It will only be used to
catch criminals.  Honest. <p>

We Don't Need No Stinkin' Warrant
================================= <p>

Maybe now would be a good time to mention the National Security
Agency. You know these guys.  Super-secret, spook agency.  Their
mission?  To monitor and intercept foreign communications.  Did you
catch that word FOREIGN?  I hope so, it's crucial. <p>

The NSA is only allowed to intercept foreign communications --
spying on U.S. citizens is a crime.  They can't even pry into a
U.S. citizen's business a court ordered wiretap.  A judge would
never allow it.  Yet it was the NSA that cooked up this whole
Clipper Chip scheme.  Why you ask? Good question. But the
Administration refuses to discuss the issue. <p>

Here's another they can't answer.  Suppose the NSA intercepts a
message from Iraq and finds it's Clipper encrypted (that damn
little black box is specially made to sniff out the Clipper's
algorithm and descramble it's social security number).  What does
the NSA do with this encrypted Iraqi message? How does it decrypt
the message? There's a classic Catch-22 running here. <p>

Agencies need the Clipper keys from the escrow agents to read the
message or listen in on the conversation.  But to get the keys you
need proof that you have a warrant.  The NSA is *never* issued a
warrant.  You see, the NSA doesn't need a warrant to spy on FOREIGN
communications. <p>

So, this begs the $64,000 question is:  How does the NSA get the
escrow agents to give them the keys to decrypt the message if they
can't show a warrant? <p>

Answer:  They don't have to show a warrant;  they don't have to
cause; they don't have to show spit. <p>

What's wrong with this picture? <p>

"We have appropriate procedures and safeguards built into the
system for the NSA," Nelson said.  "I can't tell you what those
are, of course, that would divulging too much about the NSA's
operation." <p>

Fox Guarding the Chickens
========================= <p>

There will be absolutely no abuse of the system.  This is what the
Administration would like you to believe.  They also would like you
to believe that President's don't approve Watergate break-ins, that
arms are never traded for hostages, that the FBI never secretly
records civil rights leaders in the heat of infidelity and that FBI
directors have never shown a proclivity for red sequined dresses
and shiny high-heeled cruel shoes. <p>

Representatives from four government organizations stood before the
press and outlined all the careful thinking and rigorous safeguards
that have gone into this system.  There are at least 9 different
steps that must be followed to get these Clipper keys transferred
from the escrow agents to the agency authorized to do the wiretap. <p>

Fair enough, isn't it?  Well, it would be except for the fact that
the Justice Department intentionally wrote a giant fucking loop-
hole into the law. <p>

Buried in the Justice Department briefing papers, outlining the
authorization procedures for release of the escrow keys, is this
gem: "These procedures do not create, and are not intended to
create, any substantive rights for individuals intercepted through
electronic surveillance, and noncompliance with these procedures
shall not provide the basis for any motion to suppress or other
objection to the introduction of electronic surveillance evidence
lawfully acquired." <p>

So, if somebody screws up, like for instance, asks for the keys to
be sent before they actually have a wiretap in hand, or has no
wiretap authority at all! there is no recourse provision. <p>

Criminals As Dumb Shits
======================= <p>

But what about that wily criminal element?  Once they get wind of
this, won't they seek out another type of encryption?  The FBI
doesn't think so. In fact, the FBI thinks criminals are such dumb
shits that they'll forget all about the fact that Clipper even
exists. <p>

"I predict that few criminals will remember years from now what
they've read in the Wall Street Journal" about how these devices
were installed in telephones, said FBI's James Kallestrom.  (Of
course, if criminals are so stupid, why are they perusing the Wall
St. Journal... maybe he really meant the New York Times...) <p>

So let's get this right.  The FBI is sure that criminals will "just
forget" that Clipper is installed in their phones and use them
anyway.  These are the criminals that also would be forgetting that
their multi-million dollar drug deals, not to mention their own
sweet ass, could be in jeopardy every time they make a call.  Yes,
the government really thinks so. <p>

It's more likely that some bright, enterprising criminal mind will
create a worldwide black market that deals in "non-Clipper
Installed" encryption devices.  Damn, talk about an industry with
some growth potential. <p>

Getting To the Data Stream
========================== <p>

The whole damn program goes into the crapper, however, if the
government can't get access to source, to the digital data stream,
as it comes out of the telephone switch.  In order to do this you
have to tap the digital conversation.  That's right, you guessed
it: Digital Wiretap Access. <p>

The FBI failed on its own last year to generate any support in
Congress for this digital wiretap proposal.   Hell, the FBI
couldn't even get a single member of Congress to introduce the
thing.  So the FBI broke the chain of command: They got the
President and Vice President to sign off on the idea. <p>

The Administration will soon announce its decision on how it will
give the FBI the right to easily wiretap even your unencrypted
conversations. "Within a few months at most we should have
something decided," said Barry Smith of the FBI's Congressional
Affairs office.  The FBI's Kallestrom said it was "all but a done
deal." <p>

This isn't a question of whether or not the Administration will
line up behind the FBI on this.  It already has.  It's only a
matter of paperwork, and the nagging little issue of how to pay for
making the telephone companies comply with the new rules.  But
these are small details, compared to the heat the Administration
already knows it'll take when they finally unwrap this puppy. <p>

Private No More
=============== <p>

OSTP's Nelson quipped that these security and privacy issues are
the Cyberspace version of the Administration's muddied Bosnia
policy. <p>

Like Bosnia, the White House expects the American public to "trust
us" on this issue.  After all, the Administration says, they know
a hell of a lot more than we do about what kind criminal activity
is really going down. <p>

Trusting these law enforcement and intelligence agencies is one
thing; tempting them by putting all-powerful tools right into their
hip pockets is something that should generate a hue and cry loud
enough for all of Washington to hear. <p>

So, if you're really pissed off, just pick up the phone can call
your neighbor.  Somebody in Washington is bound to hear it. <p>

Meeks out.... <p>

Background on the Administation's encryption policy announcements <p>

Subject: for interesting people
Date: Sat, 05 Feb 94 14:23:27 -0500
From: Stephen Walker &lt;steve@tis.com&gt; <p>

Background on the Administation's encryption policy announcements <p>

On Friday Feb 4 the Clinton Administration held a press conference
to announce a progress report on the interagency review of cryptography.
Their review is not finished but the following was made public: <p>

- approval of the Escrow Encryption Standard and thus formalization
of the Clipper key escrow process. <p>

The EES (now FIPS 185) is the first "classified" Federal Information
Processing Standard. The standard describes two classified "R21 Informal
Technical Reports" that "will be required to assure interoperability
of EES devices." "Organizations holding an  appropriate security clearance
and entering into a Memorandum of Agreement with the National Security
Agency regarding implementation of the standard will be provided access
to the classified specifications. Inquires may be made regarding the
Technical Reports and this program to Director, National Security Agency,
Fort George G. Meade, MD 20755-6000, ATTN: R21." <p>

This is the first time in the history of FIPS (dating back to 1965 or so)
that clearances are required to implement a federal standard. This is a
direct consequence of using a classifed algorithm and classified key escrow
procedure to protect unclassified information. <p>

The approval of the EES was made over the nearly unanimous objections
(several hundred to two) received during the public comment period. The
rationale for why the overwhelming public comments were overruled will
most likely not be made available since it is classified. <p>

It was announced that Clipper devices with key escrow will be able
to be exported. <p>

When asked about the international acceptability of key escrow, the comment
was made that "little progress has been made" in discussions with other
governments that have taken place even "as little as three weeks ago". <p>

- procedures for export control of already exportable
cryptographic products will be relaxed. <p>

However, there will be no change in what can and cannot be exported.
If your product cannot be exported today, it will not be able to be
exported tomorrow. <p>

Apparently the growing body of information concerning the foreign
availability of DES and related products and the ease with which
other countries allow the export of DES products has, thus far, had no
influence on government policy makers. <p>

- details on key escrow agents (NIST and Treasury (it seemed
important to someone to point out that neither of these were "law
enforcement" related agencies)) and key escrow procedures were announced. <p>

- establishment of an interagency working group on encryption and
telecommunication policy. <p>

- a decision not to proceed with the licensing of the Digital
Signature Algorithm to Public Key Partners, a proposal put forward last
June which met with another overwhelming public (including foreign
governments) condemnation. <p>

Apparently the fact that this exclusive licensing would be at considerable
cost to the public is now viewed as not in the government's best interest. <p>

Unfortunately, little was said about what would happen to the Digital
Signature Standard. The government will proceed down three paths: <p>

- attempting to negotiate a deal with Public Key Partners,
   - resorting to "other legal" approaches, and/or
   - defining a new algorithm for the DSS. <p>

When asked if these alternatives would take a long time to resolve, the
answer was the government expects this matter to be resolved quickly. <p>

Nothing in all that was announced at the conference was other than
voluntary for the general public. <p>

Wash. Post article on Clipper 2/5/94 -- comment on <p>

<BR> From: Kevin Curran &lt;CURRAN%JHUHYG.BITNET@JHUVM.HCF.JHU.EDU&gt;
<BR> Subject:      Wash. Post article on Clipper 2/5/94 <p>

Please post to "interesting People" mailing list if you deem appropriate. <p>

David - I am reading today's page one story on the Washington Post by
John Mintz &amp; John Schwartz entitled 'Clinton Backs Security Agencies
on Computer Eavesdropping'. Hopefully a full copy of this will make it
to the interesting-people mailing list. Getting this on the front page
is a good start though. I think the only way Clinton would back down
from this would be if there was an outcry from the public. But with
many people still not on the information highway yet and more concern
and interest with ice-skating scandals, I'm afraid it's not on the
front burner yet. The public needs to be educated on this before it's too
late. Certainly one wouldn't let anyone search their home without probable
cause and a warrant. Yet today much private data (eg credit histories,
medical histories etc.) gets in the hands legally of people should have
no business with it and I fear this may increase in the future. It's very
frightening but not as frightening as a populace that is uninformed. Now
to get back to the Post article. John - I'm wondering if you could
clarify something in the article. Let me quote a short paragraph: <p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
      "Administration officials said that U.S. firms can buy powerful
      encryption equipment that does not contain the Clipper chip if
      they choose, but a White House statement said officials reserve
      the right to 'restrict access' to such technology in the future."
</BLOCKQUOTE>
 <p>

Two key questions arise:

<OL>

<LI> Is there a date in the future after which all firms would be
mandated to buy the Clipper technology?

<LI> Would those firms who bought non-Clipper encryption devices be
allowed to keep them or be forced retroactively to adapt to
Clipper?</OL>

1994-02-03 Statement on Communications Act of 1994 <P>

Date: Thu, 3 Feb 1994 22:29-0500
<BR> From: The White House &lt;75300.3115@compuserve.com&gt;
<BR> Subject: 1994-02-03 Statement on Communications Act of 1994 <p>

THE WHITE HOUSE <p>

Office of the Press Secretary<p>

<HR> 
For Immediate Release                                   February 3, 1994 <p>

STATEMENT OF THE PRESS SECRETARY <p>

The introduction today of the "Communications Act of 1994" marks
an important step toward fulfilling the President's goal of
congressional action this year that ensures the creation of the
National Information Infrastructure.  The Administration particularly
commends the leadership of Chairman Hollings, Senators Inouye, Danforth
and Stevens as well as the bill's co- sponsors for their leadership in
moving this process forward. <p>

Since the President issued that challenge in his State of the
Union Address on January 25th, Congress has begun hearings on
legislation pending in the House of Representatives and today
legislation has been introduced in the Senate. <p>

These actions demonstrate growing consensus and momentum behind
the goal that the President established and the principles earlier
enunciated by the Vice President. <p>

As explained in the Vice President's January 11th address, the
Administration's vision of the National Information Infrastructure is
driven by five basic principles: to promote investment, to provide and
protect competition, to secure open access, to provide for universal
service, and to ensure that government regulation is itself flexible
and adaptable. <p>

Each of these principles is reflected in the provisions of the
"Communications Act of 1994."  Its first three titles directly address
the need for universal service, telecommunications investment, and
regulatory reform.  Its provisions addressing the future activities of
Regional Bell Operating Companies and the ability of telephone
companies to provide cable service represent an effort to achieve the
dual goals of more competition and the protection of fair competition.
And the mandate that telecommunications carriers provide
nondiscriminatory access and interconnection to their facilities serves
to further the goal of open access for all companies providing
telecommunications and information services.  The Administration
remains committed to ensuring the role of the Department of Justice in
approving the entry of the Regional Bell Operating Companies into long
distance. <p>

The Administration is particularly pleased that the Senate bill
echoes the challenge issued by the President and Vice President -- that
all classrooms, libraries, hospitals and clinics be connected to the
National Information Infrastructure. <p>

This bill heads in the right direction.  As the legislative
process goes forward, the Administration looks forward to working with
the bill's sponsor and other members of the Senate on the final version
of Senate legislation.  In discussions with members of the Senate and
the House of Representatives, the Administration will continue to
emphasize the principles outlined in the Vice President's speech and
the specific proposals set forth in Administration white papers. <p>

The Administration looks forward to continuing its close work with
Congress in the creation and enactment of comprehensive legislation
this year that will enable all Americans to enjoy the benefits of an
advanced information infrastructure. <p>

The Electronic Frontier Foundation needs your help to ensure privacy rights! <p>

The Electronic Frontier Foundation needs your help to ensure privacy rights! <p>

* DISTRIBUTE WIDELY * <p>

Monday, February 7th, 1994 <p>

From: Jerry Berman, Executive Director of EFF
      jberman@eff.org <p>

Dear Friends on the Electronic Frontier, <p>

I'm writing a personal letter to you because the time has now come for
action. On Friday, February 4, 1994, the Administration announced that it
plans to proceed on every front to make the Clipper Chip encryption scheme
a national standard, and to discourage the development and sale of
alternative powerful encryption technologies. If the government succeeds
in this effort, the resulting blow to individual freedom and privacy could
be immeasurable. <p>

As you know, over the last three years, we at EFF have worked to ensure
freedom and privacy on the Net. Now I'm writing to let you know about
something *you* can do to support freedom and privacy. *Please take a
moment to send e-mail to U.S. Rep. Maria Cantwell (cantwell@eff.org) to
show your support of H.R. 3627, her bill to liberalize export controls on
encryption software.* I believe this bill is critical to empowering
ordinary citizens to use strong encryption, as well as to ensuring that
the U.S. software industry remains competitive in world markets. <p>

Here are some facts about the bill: <p>

Rep. Cantwell introduced H.R. 3627 in the House of Representatives on
November 22, 1993.  H.R. 3627 would amend the Export Control Act to move
authority over the export of nonmilitary software with encryption
capabilities from the Secretary of State (where the intelligence community
traditionally has stalled such exports) to the Secretary of Commerce. The
bill would also invalidate the current license requirements for
nonmilitary software containing encryption capablities, unless there is
substantial evidence that the software will be diverted, modified or
re-exported to a military or terroristic end-use. <p>

If this bill is passed, it will greatly increase the availability of
secure software for ordinary citizens. Currently, software developers do
not include strong encryption capabilities in their products, because the
State Department refuses to license for export any encryption technology
that the NSA can't decipher. Developing two products, one with less secure
exportable encryption, would lead to costly duplication of effort, so even
software developed for sale in this country doesn't offer maximum
security. There is also a legitimate concern that software companies will
simply set up branches outside of this country to avoid the export
restrictions, costing American jobs. <p>

The lack of widespread commercial encryption products means that it will
be very easy for the federal government to set its own standard--the
Clipper Chip standard. As you may know, the government's Clipper Chip
initiative is designed to set an encryption standard where the government
holds the keys to our private conversations. Together with the Digital
Telephony bill, which is aimed at making our telephone and computer
networks "wiretap-friendly," the Clipper Chip marks a dramatic new effort
on the part of the government to prevent us from being able to engage in
truly private conversations. <p>

We've been fighting Clipper Chip and Digital Telephony in the policy arena
and will continue to do so. But there's another way to fight those
initiatives, and that's to make sure that powerful alternative encryption
technologies are in the hands of any citizen who wants to use them. The
government hopes that, by pushing the Clipper Chip in every way short of
explicitly banning alternative technologies, it can limit your choices for
secure communications. <p>

Here's what you can do: <p>

I urge you to write to Rep. Cantwell today at cantwell@eff.org. In the
Subject header of your message, type "I support HR 3627." In the body of
your message, express your reasons for supporting the bill. EFF will
deliver printouts of all letters to Rep. Cantwell. With a strong showing
of support from the Net community, Rep. Cantwell can tell her colleagues
on Capitol Hill that encryption is not only an industry concern, but also
a grassroots issue. *Again: remember to put "I support HR 3627" in your
Subject header.* <p>

This is the first step in a larger campaign to counter the efforts of
those who would restrict our ability to speak freely and with privacy.
Please stay tuned--we'll continue to inform you of things you can do to
promote the removal of restrictions on encryption. <p>

In the meantime, you can make your voice heard--it's as easy as e-mail.
Write to cantwell@eff.org today. <p>

Sincerely, <p>

Jerry Berman
Executive Director, EFF
jberman@eff.org <p>

P.S. If you want additional information about the Cantwell bill, send
e-mail to cantwell-info@eff.org. To join EFF, write membership@eff.org.

Jacking in from the Congressional Port <p>

"Brock N. Meeks" &lt;brock@well.sf.ca.us&gt; <p>

Washington, DC -- White House's slippery plan to salt information
highway with its home-grown encryption technology has irked at
least two members of Congress, prompting a call for congressional
hearings. <p>

Senator Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), chairman of the Technology and Law
Subcommittee said he would likely hold hearings "on the serious
issues raised" by Administration's announcement that it would
urge private sector to voluntarily adopt its Clipper Chip
technology.  "Basically, what this means is that the United
States Government will hold the two keys to unlock any private
communication coded with this program," Leahy said.  Citizens and
potential foreign customers aren't likely to see Clipper "as the
solution to privacy and security concerns," he said. <p>

White House plan was called "disappointing," by Rep. Don Edwards
(D-Cal.).  "I was hoping for a more realistic policy from the
Administration," said Edwards, a former FBI agent.  "Competitors
all over the world can sell the strongest encryption technology,
but U.S. companies cannot," he said. <p>

Leahy waded in on Administration and law enforcement claims that
Clipper would help thwart terrorist and criminal activity, saying
it was "obvious" these groups would shun Clipper enabled devices.
"Why would any sophisticated criminal or terrorist decide to use
Clipper Chip to keep their communications secret when this is the
one encryption method to which the government holds the keys?" he
asked. <p>

Despite Leahy's misgivings, the Administration and law
enforcement agencies continue to bank on the success of Clipper
because most criminals are "just dumb," the FBI has stated
repeatedly. <p>

The Administration's decision to keep the handcuffs on export
controls of privately developed encryption schemes also worried
the congressmen.  Leahy called it "a misstep... Why would any
foreign government want to buy American software or
telecommunications equipment containing Clipper Chip when the
U.S. government has the keys to eavesdrop on any private
communications?" <p>

Edwards said the new policy "won't stop terrorists and drug
traffickers from acquiring encryption technology," adding he
hoped President Clinton would "look at this policy again." <p>

The government shouldn't be in the business of mandating
particular technologies, Leahy said.  "Whatever confidence I
might have that the U.S. government will limit its use of the
decoding keys to specific and justifiable law enforcement
objectives, I doubt my confidence will be universally shared," he
said. <p>

Meeks out... <p>

Well, almost... Leahy's office said he *wants* to hear from the
public on the matter of holding hearings.  Any and all comments
on the viability of the program, any concerns the public has,
should be sent to Leahy immediately, a staffer said.  Leahy can
be reached at:  Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC 20510;
his phone number is 202-224-3406. <p>

"so how long before the other shoe drops?" <p>

Law professor Dan Burk of George Macon U. contributes this to the cyberia
mailing list: <p>

I guess that I'll need to review DOJ's mumbo-jumbo more carefully, but
I was under the impression that the feds would supposedly obtain the
encryption keys from the escrow agents *after* they had a warrant in
hand (thus satisfying Trotter's "neutral magistrate" requirement -- in
theory). <p>

Even assuming that the plan calls for judicial review sufficient to
meet separation of powers/4th amendment requirements, it is just as
disturbing as ever: <p>

1) The escrow "agents" are executive branch federal agencies with no
incentive to consider the interests of the accused or even to seriously
review whether a warrant has properly issued, and, <p>

2) DOJ's disclaimer that the escrow plan creates no substantive right
strongly suggests that they fully expect the plan will be misused/abused. <p>

3) The administration doth protest too much that adherence to the escrow
standard is "voluntary."  It does the law enforcement agencies no good
to have this standard unless other encryption methods are unavailable --
so how long before the other shoe drops? <p>

response to Mike Nelson <p>

From: John Schwartz &lt;jswatz@well.sf.ca.us&gt; <P>

Mike Nelson claims to be mystified at the Washington Post's
statement that the White House has retained the right to restrict
encryption technology. That statement comes from the White House's own
background papers distributed at the NIST announcement. The statement,
delivered in question-and answer form, asked whether the administration
would restrict access to encryption technology if it could not get what
it needed from the just-announced Clipper plan. The answer was that these
are fundamental issues and are still under consideration--not a "no"
answer. <p>

I hope this clears up the misunderstanding.

********************************************************************** <p>

Mr. Speaker, I am today introducing legislation to amend the Export
Administration Act of 1979 to liberalize export controls on software with
encryption capabilities. <p>

A vital American industry is directly threatened by unilateral U.S.
Government export controls which prevent our companies from meeting
worldwide user demand for software that includes encryption capabilities to
protect computer data against unauthorized disclosure, theft, or
alteration. <p>

The legislation I am introducing today is needed to ensure that
American companies do not lose critical international markets to foreign
competitors that operate without significant export restrictions. Without
this legislation, American software companies, some of America's star
economic performers, have estimated they stand to lose between $6 and $9
billion in revenue each year. American hardware companies are already
losing hundreds of millions of dollars in lost computer system sales
because increasingly sales are dependent on the ability of a U.S. firm to
offer encryption as a feature of an integrated customer solution involving
hardware, software, and services. <p>

The United States' export control system is broken. It was designed
as a tool of the cold-war, to help fight against enemies that no longer
exist. The myriad of Federal agencies responsible for controlling the flow
of exports from our country must have a new charter, recognizing today's
realities. <p>

Next year, the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee of Economic
Policy, Trade and the Environment, of which I am a member, will be marking
up legislation to overhaul the Export Administration Act. It is my hope
that the legislation I introduce today will be included in the final Export
Administration Act rewrite. <p>

This legislation takes some important steps to resolve a serious
problem facing some of our most dynamic industries. It would give the
Secretary of Commerce exclusive authority over dual use information
security programs and products, eliminates the requirement for export
licenses for generally available software with encryption capabilities, and
requires the Secretary to grant such validated licenses for exports of
other software with encryption capabilities to any country to which we
already approve exports for foreign financial institutions. <p>

The importance of this legislation cannot be overstated. America's
computer software and hardware companies, including such well-known
companies as Apple, DEC, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Lotus, Microsoft, Novell,
and WordPerfect, have been among the country's most internationally
competitive firms earning more than one-half of their revenues from
exports. <p>

The success of American software and hardware companies overseas is
particularly dramatic and the importance of foreign markets is growing.
Currently, American software companies hold a 75 percent worldwide market
share and many derive over 50 percent of their revenues from foreign sales.
American computer hardware manufacturers earn more than 60 percent of their
revenues from exports. <p>

As my colleagues are well-aware, we are participants in a new
information age that is quickly transforming local and national
marketplaces and creating new international marketplaces where none
previously existed. President Clinton and Vice President Gore have both
spent considerable time explaining their vision of the National Information
Infrastructure that is essential to our continued economic growth. <p>

Part of that infrastructure is already in place. International
business transactions that just a few years ago took days or weeks or
months to complete can now be accomplished in minutes. <p>

Driving this marketplace transformation is the personal computer.
And, at the heart of every personal computer is computer software. Even the
most computer illiterate of us recognize that during the past decade,
computer prices have dropped dramatically while computer capabilities have
increased exponentially. That combination has made it possible to exchange
information and conduct business at a scale that was considered science
fiction only a few years ago. <p>

Indeed, we all now rely on computer networks to conduct business
and exchange information. Whether it be the electronic mail or "e-mail"
system that we all now use in our congressional offices or the automated
teller system relied on to conduct our personal financial affairs, we rely
on computer networks of information. <p>

In the future, individuals will use information technologies to
conduct virtually any of the routine transactions that they do today in
person, over the telephone, and through paper files. From personal
computers at home, in schools, and in public libraries, they will access
books, magazine articles, videos, and multimedia resources on any topic
they want. People will use computer networks to locate and access
information about virtually any subject imaginable, such as background on
the candidates in local political races, information on job opportunities
in distant cities, the weather in the city or country they will be visiting
on their vacation, and the highlights of specific sports events. <p>

Consumers will use their computers and smart televisions to shop
and pay for everything from clothing and household goods to airline
tickets, insurance, and all types of on-line services. Electronic records
of the items they purchase and their credit histories will be easy to
compile and maintain. <p>

Individuals will access home health programs from their personal
computers for instant advice on medical questions, including mental health
problems, information about the symptoms of AIDS, and a variety of personal
concerns that they would not want other family members, or their neighbors
and employers to know about. They will renew their prescriptions and obtain
copies of their lab results electronically. <p>

The U.S. economy is becoming increasingly reliant on this
information network. While we may not often think about these networks,
they now affect every facet of our professional, business, and personal
lives. They are present when we make an airline reservation; when we use a
credit card to make a purchase; or when we visit a doctor who relies on a
computer network to store our medical information or to assist in making a
diagnosis. These networks contain information concerning every facet of our
lives. <p>

For businesses, the reliance on information security is even
greater. While businesses rely on the same commercial use networks that
individual consumers use, in addition, businesses are now transmitting
information across national and international borders with the same ease
that the information was once transmitted between floors of the same office
building. <p>

While all of this information exchange brings with it increased
efficiencies and lower operating costs, it has also brought with it the
need to protect the information from improper use and tampering. <p>

Information security is quickly becoming a top priority for businesses that
rely on computer networks to conduct business. According to a recent survey
of Fortune 500 companies conducted for the Business Software Alliance, 90
percent of the participants said that information security was important to
their operations. Indeed, almost half of the Fortune 500 companies surveyed
recently stated that data encryption was important to protect their
information. One third of those companies said they look for encryption
capabilities when buying software. <p>

The challenge for information security can be met by America's
computer companies. American companies are deeply involved in efforts to
ensure that the information transmitted on computer networks is secure.
Numerous companies have developed and are developing software products with
encryption capabilities that can ensure that transmitted information is
received only by the intended user and that it is received in an unaltered
form. Those encryption capabilities are based on mathematical formulas or
logarithms of such a size that makes it almost impossible to corrupt data
sources or intercept information being transmitted. <p>

I wish I could stand here today and tell my colleagues that U.S.
export control laws were working and encryption technology was only
available to American software companies. <p>

However, this is not the case. Sophisticated encryption technology
has been available as a published public standard for over a decade and
many private sources, both domestic and foreign, have developed encryption
technology that they are marketing to customers today. It is an industry
where commercial competition is fierce and success will go to the swift. <p>

Software is being developed and manufactured with encryption
capabilities for the simple reason that software customers are demanding
it. Computer users recognize the vulnerability of our information systems
to corruption and improper use and are insisting on protection. That
protection will be purchased or obtained from American companies or from
foreign software companies. The choice is not whether the protection will
be obtained, but from which company. <p>

Incredible as it may seem to most of my colleagues, the Executive
Branch has seen fit to regulate exports of American computer software with
encryption capabilities -- that is, the same software that is available
across the counter at your local Egghead or Computerland software store --
munitions and thereby substantially prohibit its export to foreign
customers. This policy, which has all the practical effect of shutting the
barn door after the horses have left in preventing access to software with
encryption capabilities, does have the actual detrimental effect of
seriously endangering sales of both generally available American software
and American computer systems. <p>

This is because increasingly sales are dependent on the ability of
a U.S. firm to offer encryption as a feature of an integrated customer
solution involving hardware, software and services. <p>

Indeed, software can be exported abroad by the simplest measures
and our intelligence gathering agencies have no hope of ever preventing it.
Unlike most munitions that are on the prohibited export list, generally
available software with encryption capabilities can be purchased without
any record by anyone from thousands of commercial retail outlets, or
ordered from hundreds of commercial mail order houses, or obtained for free
from computer bulletin boards or networks. Once obtained, it can be
exported on a single indistinguishable floppy disk in the coat pocket of
any traveler or in any business envelope mailed abroad. <p>

Moreover, both generally available and customized software can be
exported without anyone ever actually leaving the United States. All that
is necessary are two computers with modems, one located in the United
States and one located abroad. A simple international phone call and a few
minutes is all that it takes to export any software program. <p>

Once a software program with encryption capabilities is in a
foreign country, any computer can act as a duplicating machine, producing
as many perfect copies of the software as needed. The end result is that
the software is widely available to foreign users. <p>

All this was demonstrated at a hearing held on October 12 by
Chairman Gejdenson's Economic Policy Trade and Environment Subcommittee of
the Foreign Affairs Committee. <p>

Furthermore, while current Executive Branch policy regulates the
export of American manufactured software with encryption capabilities, it
is obviously powerless to prevent the development and manufacture of such
software by foreign competitors. Not surprisingly, that is exactly what is
happening. We heard testimony at the subcommittee's hearing that over 200
foreign hardware, software and combination products for text, file, and
data encryption are available from 20 foreign countries. As a result,
foreign customers, that have, in the past, spent their software dollars on
American-made software, are now being forced, by American policy, to buy
foreign software -- and in some cases, entire foreign computer systems. The
real impact of these policies is that customers and revenue are being lost
with little hope of regaining them, once lost. All precipitated by a
well-intentioned, but completely misguided and inappropriate policy. <p>

There were efforts, in the last Congress to correct this policy. In
response, the Bush Administration did, in fact, marginally improve its
export licensing process with regard to mass market software with limited
encryption capabilities. However, those changes are simply insufficient to
eliminate the damage being done to American software companies. <p>

My legislation is strongly supported by the Business Software
Alliance. The Business Software Alliance represents the leading American
software businesses, including Aldus, Apple Computer, Autodesk, Borland
International, Computer Associates, GO Corp., Lotus Development, Microsoft,
Novell, and WordPerfect. In addition, Adobe Systems, Central Point, Santa
Cruz Operation, and Symantec are members of BSA's European operation.
Together, BSA members represent 70 percent of PC software sales. <p>

The legislation is also supported by the Industry Coalition on
Technology Transfer, an umbrella group representing 10 industry groups
including the Aerospace Industries Association, American Electronic
Association, Electronics Industry Association, and Computer and Business
Equipment Manufacturing Association. <p>

All these companies are at the forefront of the software
revolution. Their software, developed for commercial markets, is available
throughout the world and is at the core of the information revolution. They
represent the finest of America's future in the international marketplace,
and the industry has repeatedly been recognized as crucial to America's
technological leadership in the 21st century. <p>

My legislation is straightforward. It would allow American
companies to sell the commercial software they develop in the United States
to their overseas customers including our European allies -- something that
is very difficult if not impossible under present policies. <p>

I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and ask unanimous
consent that the text of the bill and a section-by-section explanation be
printed at this point. <p>

************************************************************************ <p>

Section-By-Section Analysis of Report Control Liberalization for
Information Security Programs and Products <p>

Section 1 <p>

Section 1 amends the Export Administration Act by adding a new
subsection that specifically addresses exports of computer hardware,
software and technology for information security including encryption. The
new subsection has three basic provisions. <p>

First, it gives the Secretary of Commerce exclusive authority over
the export of such programs and products except those which are
specifically designed for military use, including command, control and
intelligence applications or for deciphering encrypted information. <p>

Second, the government is generally prohibited from requiring a
validated export license for the export of generally available software
(e.g., mass market commercial or public domain software) or computer
hardware simply because it incorporates such software. <p>

Importantly, however, the Secretary will be able to continue
controls on countries of terrorists concern (like Libya, Syria, and Iran)
or other embargoed countries (like Cuba and North Korea) pursuant to the
Trading With The Enemy Act or the International Emergency Economic Powers
Act (except for instances where IEEPA is employed to extend EAA-based
controls when the EAA is not in force). <p>

Third, the Secretary is required to grant validated licenses for
exports of software to commercial users in any country to which exports of
such software has been approved for use by foreign financial institutions.
Importantly, the Secretary is not required to grant such export approvals
if there is substantial evidence that the software will be diverted or
modified for military or terrorists' end-use or re-exported without
requisite U.S. authorization. <p>

Section 2 <p>

Section 2 provides definitions necessary for the proper
implementation of the substantive provisions. For example, generally
available software is offered for sale or licensed to the public without
restriction and available through standard commercial channels of
distribution, is sold as is without further customization, and is designed
so as to be installed by the purchaser without additional assistance from
the publisher. Computer hardware and computing devices are also defined. <p>

Clipper discussion (sub anonymously by an IPer <p>

Dave: <p>

IT WOULD BE BEST TO POST THE FOLLOWING ANONYMOUSLY -- IF YOU POST IT. <p>

====================== <p>

In a summary of last Friday's briefings on KEE policy decisions, Steve
Walker made the following observation: <p>

"- details on key escrow agents (NIST and Treasury (it seemed
        important to someone to point out that neither of these were
        "law enforcement" related agencies)) and key escrow procedures
        were announced." <p>

I believe that his summary may have been circulated by you and it was
certainly elsewhere on the net; I suppose that his parenthetical
comment is attributed to some government person. <p>

Some clarification is warranted. <p>

It's hard to believe that the government would have made such a
statement about "law-enforcement related".  According to my
Congressional directory, BATF, the Secret Service, and the U.S.
Customs Service are all components of the Department of Treasury.
Each of them certainly has enforcement authority, carries weapons, and
generally behaves like any other government entity that is commonly
considered to be law enforcement.  Each of them is charged with
enforcing a certain set of laws, many of which involve criminal or
anti-social actions.  The most that can be said is that these three are
not components of the Department of Justice. <p>

One can cop out and assert that "law enforcement related" was intended
to mean enforcement of the laws with which the FBI and state/local
police departments of various kinds are concerned -- the things which
involve the Department of Justice and the attention of the criminal
court system. <p>

But in the strict construction of the phrase, it seems to me that the
Department of Treasury must be considered suspect as an objective
disinterested escrow agent.  Any one of the 3 components noted above
could easily be interested in wire tap activity -- which would seem to
be the proper way to measure appropriateness of an escrow agent.  In
fact, Customs is involved as a part of the drug-control community, and
the drug situation has been used as one of the arguments for recent
encryption policy decisions. <p>

NIST is clean and without enforcement authority, and there is no
component of Commerce that would appear to have enforcement
responsibility that would reasonably expect to require wire tap
support. <p>

The above are not matters of opinion; they simply reflect what the
facts are. <p>

The administration did not announce on Feb. 4th that it retained the right
to restrict alternate encryption plans for domestic use. A clarification

"Misunderstanding" a CERT advisory -- Europe reports <p>

Date: Mon, 7 Feb 1994 16:37:14 +0100
From: Klaus Brunnstein &lt;brunnstein@rz.informatik.uni-hamburg.d400.de&gt;
Subject: "Misunderstanding" a CERT advisory <p>

Waves went high in some German media on Friday, Feb.5 1994, when news from
Philadelphia (via CMU-SEI's press release) and Washington's Post was mediated
by some European news agencies. Germany's 2nd TV channel (ZDF) informed the
surprised public that *hackers had succeeded to invade a secure network which
had been installed in times of Cold War to protect US Armed  Forces even in
the case of a Nuclear War*. As several 10,000 passwords had been hacked, now
more than 20 million users have to change their password. Regional and private
TV and radio stations followed on Saturday, though only few newspapers took
this up on Monday. <p>

Nothing of this (mis)information was in the CERT advisory distributed on
Febrary 3, where users of some UNIX systems (esp. SunOS with  /dev/nit) were
informed that it might be wise to take precautionary action against a potential
sniffer attack. Now, 3 days later, responsible journalists inform us that
there were *2 agency reports*, one delivered by German press agency (dpa)
which was rather serious and non-speculative, and another one from Agency
France Press (AFP) which ZDF based it's report upon (as it was the more
"interesting one :-). Here is this in-famous text (translation by messenger): <p>

"Washington, February 5 (AFP) - Computer pirates have cracked the largest
     computer network in the world. Totally 20 million users on 'Internet'
     should receive new passwords, told the emergency committee installed by
     US ministry of defence. Internet is used by universities, government
     agencies, enterprises and private persons. The network was established
     in times of the Cold War to serve US Armed Forces also in case of Atomic
     War as 'invulnerable' information network. The hackers, so far unidenti-
     fied, succeeded according to the emergency committee to read data from
     ten thousands of systems on 'Internet'. They succeeded by using a program
     named 'Trojan Horse' which allows legal access to Internet central com-
     puter but then does not go any further." <p>

Apart from the many wrong or misunderstood facts in this news, the reaction of
some experts was interesting. German Information Agency (GISA) said: "Old
stuff, no reason panic!" Another expert said: "CERT is in actual fight for
money from US administration, they needed some public attention!" General
comments were: "Blind actionism of US' CERT!" <p>

Somehow, the media uproar reminds of the Michelangelo case where cautious
warnings of experts (infection at most small percentage of PCs) were publicly
raised *up to 50 mio infected PC systems* by badly informed journalists.
No expert can ever exclude that her/his warnings are always correctly under-
stood, but in this case, the serious question is: With so many unknown
parameters (how many different sniffer trojans existed? How many nodes were
affected? For what purposes were the sniffers used? etc): why issued CERT/CC
a press release (which it very rarely did so far), in addition to its advisory? <p>

Unfortunately, this unjustified media hysteria will fall back, as in previous
cases, on those who work hard for improving security and safety of systems
and networks:-) This is why the background must be carefully analysed. <p>

Re: CORRECTION on Clipper and Wash Post <p>

John Schwartz writes: <p>

&gt;         A White House briefing paper quoted in the Feb. 5 Washington Post

&gt; information provided by the administration for last week's announcement.
&gt; The administration did not announce on Feb. 4th that it retained the right

That's true, but the Administration also did not retract its comment
from the April 16 Q-and-A. <p>

Let's be clear about this. The Administration said on Friday that
it was not making Clipper mandatory. But the Administration has also
said that it does not believe that citizens have the right to
unbreakable encryption "as a matter of right." Nothing said on
Friday retracted the prior comment. <p>

Remember, there's a difference between: <p>

"The Administration did not say on Friday that it might consider banning
alternative encryption technologies" <p>

and <p>

"The Administration will not consider banning alternative encryption
technologies." <p>

National Cryptology Museum <p>

Date: Thu, 3 Feb 94 14:08:06 -0500
From: hunter@work.nlm.nih.gov (Larry Hunter)
Subject: National Cryptology Museum <p>

Following up on Jeremy Epstein's note in RISKS 15.41, I went to visit the
National Cryptology Museum, and can recommend it.  It's open 9am-3pm weekdays
and by appointment.  It's basically one large room, with several interesting
displays; my favorite was 7 volumes from the NSA rare book collection,
including the oldest published work on cryptology, Johannes Trithemius'
"Polygraphiae," first published in 1517.  They also had a Pace-10 analog
computer, and IBM Harvest and a Cray XMP-24 on display.  There were nice
historical displays on Yarley &amp; the Black Chamber, US Civil War crypto and a
US Revolutionary War era crypto device (the M-94) that may have been designed
by Thomas Jefferson.  The largest display was dedicated to Enigma and the
device for cracking it, Bombe.  There is a working Enigma that visitors can
use!  There are a few displays that are more current: pictures of the NSA
buildings and director and a description of NSA's Special Processing Lab (SPL)
which does special purpose chip fabrication.  There was the expected KGB
stuff, and a quote from George Washington about the importance of "keeping the
whole matter secret." <p>

The curator, Jack Ingrams, was friendly and eager to answer (some) questions.
He said that since the Washington Post article, traffic had been about 25-30
people a day, and that they will be on TV this week, which he expects to
further increase the number of visitors.  He was curious about the RISKS
posting and internet, so if anybody who sees this talks to him while visiting,
mention the net.  He also said that they will be opening the unclassified
portion of their crypto library to scholars sometime in the summer.  The
handout on the museum also says that the FOIA reading room shares space with
the library. <p>

Obligatory RISK-y note: Ingrams mentioned that the museum opened to NSA
personnel in October, and to the general public around Christmas time.  A
quick glance through the guest sign-in book shows that the fourth visitor to
the museum, on October 29, was one Duane Whitlock, who listed his employer as
C&amp;P Telephone, our local baby bell.  hmmm. <p>

The CLIPPER CHIP CONTROVERSY <p>

The Clinton Adminstration - bowing to pressure from the
Intelligence Community - has decided to go ahead with the clipper
chip proposal. <p>

BACKGROUND ON THE CLIPPER CHIP PROPOSAL AND ITS BENEFITS <p>

This proposal is best understood in the context of the history of
the western intelligence community. <p>

The ability to secretly intercept the communications of others has
been vital to covert action since the earliest days of
international telecommunications. When the first transatlantic
cable was laid between Britain and the U.S. in 1927; its operations
where monitored by secret agreement between both countries.
Britain would capture and analyze all calls comming from the U.S.
and the Americans would do the same with british traffic. Relevant
material would be sent back to each other. This allowed both
countries to honestly proclaim they were not spying on their own
citizens, while benefiting from the fact that someone else was. <p>

By the end of the second world war; a war that the allies won
primarily because of stategic advantage gained from superior
telecommunication interception; the english speaking powers agreed
to create a multinational agency to capture all the information in
the world. Every newspaper, radio braodcast, t.v. transmission, and
international telegraph or phone call was to be captured and
recorded and stored for possible future analysis. <p>

That agreement is still in place. The publications of the FBIS [
Foriegn Broadcast Information Service ] are an example of the
publicly disclosed results of the joint monitoring program. <p>

Today, Canada intercepts private communication in the U.S. and vice
versa. This is not illegal. Each country's laws forbid it from
invading the privacy of its own citizens. These same laws
intentionally provide no such protection for the communications of
other nations. <p>

The Internet began as a service of the U.S. military. It is
impossible to believe that national security considerations were
not incorporated into its design. To this day the highest level
technical meetings on Internet design in the U.S. can only be
attended by individuals with security clearances. <p>

The Internet is above all an international network. Messages travel
around the globe in fractions of a second. From an intelligence
prespective this amounts to providing an unwanted window on the
U.S. to the rest of the world. A disloyal government employee could
encode a document - and send it over the internet to anyone in the
world. An illegally distributed document, once securely encoded may
be captured, but unless it is crackable, the government would be
hard put to determine the nature of the damage done to its security
interests, because it could not determine what document it had in
its possession. The recent decision of the Department of Defence
to end Internet access for most of its employees is grounded in
these considerations. <p>

Similar considerations arise for companies that depend on technical
secrets for their market advantage, or that wish to be certain that
their strategies can not be discovered by competitors. <p>

Ordinary citizens also value privacy. <p>

Of course - the internet isn't the only problem technology. Digital
cellular phones will soon be voice activated and may weigh less
than an ounce. The same disloyal government employee will then be
able to capture and encode a document. Then, with the aid of a
cellular modem, broadcast it to any point on the globe.
<hr> <p>

A good situation for a national intelligence service is one in
which your own communications are untapable, while everyone elses
are easily accessed. The ideal situation exists when everyone
believes that their own systems are secure - when they are in fact
not secure. <p>

The clipper chip proposal - if universally - adopted would appear
to provide the U.S. government with a nearly ideal solution to a
crisis that has arisen in connection to the Internet. <p>

The crisis arises from the fact that cheap secure encryption
software and now hardware has become globally available for the
first time; from Albania to Zaire everyone who owns a computer can
guarantee their own privacy. In essence - the cat is already out
of the bag and a desperate effort is underway to stuff it back in. <p>

Accepting that a genuine problem exists. Is the Clipper chip
proposal a reasonable solution. If it is not a reasonable solution,
are there other - better approaches. Or, will one have to accept
the fact that the nature of the struggle for advantage thru
technical espionage has changed.
<hr> <p>

WHAT ARE THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS AND WHO ARE THE LIKELY
BENEFICIARIES <p>

The Clipper Chip proposal is an excellent solution if you are a
foreign company or nation interested in obtaining competitive
economic advantage over the United States. I expect that foreign
governments will begin lobbying immediately for adoption of the
proposal in the U.S. Here is why. <p>

It will not prevent them from using effective encryption outside
of the U.S. <p>

The United states represents only about 18% of the global market
place but it currently dominates in several hardware and software
cataegories. <p>

These include supercomputers, network software and hardware,
desktop software, cpu chips, most catagories of business software
for all classes of machines. <p>

With adoption of these proposals - each of these categories will
become easier to gain market share in outside of the U.S.
Intel and Microsoft and Novell along with IBM, Thinking Machines
and Wais should all see significant declines in their market share. <p>

Network Service providers like AT&amp;T or Sprint should be easy to
defeat as they try to sell services in external markets. <p>

If similar legislation is also passed in the area of cellular
communications, we can expect to see a dramatic decline in the
market share for Motorola products as well. <p>

In the future as research on encryption techniques comes to a
standstill in the U.S. Foreign firms will be able to develop
optimized encryption standards that will meet the demands for the
emerging Multimedia market. Multimedia vendors seeking product
protection need efficient encryption standards to allow protection
of property rights. Encryption standards that slow down
transmission or minimize the effectiveness of compression
techniques will help quarantee the success of foriegn firms. <p>

SHOULD FORIEGN FIRMS REALLY SPEND MONEY ON LOBBYING. <p>

Yes, despite the past history of success by the intelligence
community in crippling U.S. competitiveness in overseas markets in
areas like desktop computing and database software, and despite
that community's success in making U.S. companies the final
entrants in the Vietnames market and the China market; you can not
count on the continuing willingness of the American people to
accept these impediments. <p>

In addition U.S. passage of this legislation may actual improve the
competitive advantage of a well prepared nation or corporate group.
U.S. history is repleat with examples of trusted individuals who
have used intelligence information for private gain or sold it for
other reasons. <p>

When men like former the multimillionaire Director of the CIA,
William Casey, had to be stopped from using intelligence
information for personal gain by Congress; there are probably few
serious limits the corruptablity of intelligence community staff.
And the clipper chip proposal is based upon trusting the keys to
chip's security system in the hands of low paid bureaucrats. Men
who may include among their ranks individuals like the Walker
Family who sold satelite intelligence secrets to the Russians for
peanuts. <p>

The real danger here is that the U.S. might actually begin work on
improved encryption standards for incorporation in U.S. made
products. Such activity would create market advantage for American
companies. <p>

ISN'T IT A DANGER TO OTHER COUNTRIES AND COMPANIES IF ENCRYPTION
THAT IS NOT BREAKABLE IS IN WIDE USE? <p>

Not really. The Soviet Union and Isreal both managed to coexist
with the United States even though the U.S. was incapable of
breaking their codes. Both countries successfully employed spies
and informants to obtain material and information that was
otherwise protected from decypherment. Both countries shared
intelligence information obtained from the U.S. so this raises the
possibility that foriegn firms could unite in obtaining economic
advantage over the US. <p>

Because plans must be turned into action - existing national
technical means are sufficient to guarantee the physical security
of the U.S. <p>

AREN'T THERE OTHER REAL BENEFITS TO THE US FROM THE ADOPTION OF
SUCH SYSTEMS? <p>

Well, if the U.S. government adopted the clipper chip standard for
all its internal communication. It would be able to gain some
control of untrustworthy employees who wished to use technical
means in subverting the US. People like Jonathan Pollard who simply
physically removed documents from their safe storage sites, would
of course be unaffected. Similarly the Walker family was exposed
only because of a family feud. <p>

WHAT ABOUT ORGANIZED CRIME ETC. <p>

The US government's inability to prevent the ongoing success of
organized crime despite the availability of wire taps and
informants is a testimony to the intelligence of these criminal
organizations. Implementation of the clipper chip proposals will
not result in any change in their successful strategies for
avoiding monitoring. <p>

ISN'T THERE ANYONE WHO WILL DEFINITELY BENEFIT FROM THIS? <p>

Yes, some company will get the contract for these chips.

"I support HR3627" -- privacy in communications <p>

Date: Wed, 9 Feb 94 07:37 EST
From: "Robert G. Moskowitz" &lt;0003858921@mcimail.com&gt;
To: cantwell &lt;cantwell@eff.org&gt;
To: US president &lt;president@whitehouse.gov&gt;
To: US vice-president &lt;vice-president@whitehouse.gov&gt;
Subject: I support HR3627 <p>

It seems to me that privacy in communications requires three things: <p>

-  Authentication/non-reputiation
-  Guarantied data content
-  Encryption of data <p>

Authentication/non-reputiation is not only a security item, i.e. am I
communicating with the person I want to, but also a legal issue.  If someone
says that they will do something in a non-reputiable message and doesn't,
they later cannot deny that they made the statement as it is non-reputiable. <p>

The data content must be guarantied, as not only might it be maliciously
corrupted, but computer programs that forward data have been known to do
things wrong, and communication links have been known to alter a byte or
two. <p>

Data encryption allows for private communications over public servers. <p>

The Clipper chip only addresses the last item.  And then only over a
private, point-to-point link.  The Clipper chip on a third party provider's
communication link is no assurance that one of the data forwarding systems
on the data path has not been comprimised and my data is still being
'watched'. <p>

There is an INTERNATIONAL, GATT based standard for EMail that addresses
this.  It is called X.509.  X.509 combines Public Key cryptography and
message hashing to meet all three requirements.  According to many people
that know the legal side better than me, X.509 has been agreed to by the US
government at a treaty level and thus needs to be supported and allowed by
the US government.  Thus the US government cannot take a unilateral position
of saying that the Clipper Chip technology is the only communications
security the public needs. <p>

It is also incumbant on the US government to encourage its citizens to
produce the best X.509 products possible to maintain a competitive edge in
the messaging software arena.  Thus a bill like HR3627 is a key bill. <p>

I know that there are limitations and implementation issues to X.509.  Also
X.509 does not well address real time and interactive communications.  There
are other efforts in various standard bodies that are addressing this;
Privacy Enhance Mail for INTERNET 822 mail, Kerberos (tm) security for the
Distributed Computing Environment to name two.  The US government needs to
nuture technologies like these; they meet critical needs of corporate users
of data communications.  And again Clipper chip technology does nothing for
them. <p>

To this end, I ask the US government to pass HR3627 and to scale back the
Clipper Chip push.  The Clipper chip should be relegated to voice and fax
communication at best.  There are better, more functional technologies for
data communications. <p>

ON FRIDAY, WHEN the Electronic Frontier Foundation declared war on the
  Clinton Administration, the atrium of the Citicorp Building in midtown
  Manhattan was thick with brooding, alienated teenagers.
     The atrium is like that on the first Friday of every month. The
  hackers cluster around tables, peer at wired gadgets, trade computer
  printouts and read back issues of 2600 Magazine, the Hackers Quarterly,
  which sponsors these monthly get-togethers and gives the digital
  underground a fine excuse to get out of the house and meet face-to-face.
     Curiously, few people were talking about the latest panic to sweep
  the Internet: Tens of thousands of passwords and accounts had supposedly
  been captured by unknown hackers, according to an advisory piped out
  across the Net. The advisory came from the Computer Emergency Response
  Team, the federally funded security patrol of the global Internet. How
  this number  -  tens of thousands of accounts  -  was calculated is
  unclear. CERT doesn't disclose specific break-in reports, doesn't say
  who the victims were, doesn't say what, if any, damage resulted or when
  any of this occurred. It merely sounds the general alarm.
     You can believe CERT's numbers, or not. The people in this atrium did
  not, knowing all too well how hacking the Internet has been a more or
  less constant diversion over the years.
     And John Perry Barlow, does not. Barlow, who was here for his first
  2600 meeting, is a lyricist for the Grateful Dead and a former Wyoming
  rancher turned Chelsea resident. Most important, he's a cofounder of the
  Electronic Frontier Foundation, an organization that aims to protect the
  civil liberties of the citizens of cyberspace. The group has become a
  powerful lobbying force in Washington, helping set the agenda for
  national communications policy.
      To Barlow, the Internet break-ins are merely diverting the public's
  attention from something far more threatening to cyberspace: the Clipper
  chip.
     The Clipper is used to scramble conversations over phone lines and
  computer networks. By declaring it the standard, the government is
  ensuring that the Clipper will be built into every phone and computer
  since any company seeking to do business with the government must use
  Clipper-enhanced equipment.
     What has riled the EFF and a number of other civil liberties groups,
  as well as a coalition of large computer and telecommunications
  companies, is this: The chip has a "backdoor" that would allow
  law-enforcement agencies, with the proper court warrants, to unscramble
  conversations and eavesdrop. The government has argued it needs such
  access to thwart drug dealers and terrorists.
      To protect against abuse, a "key" will be needed to unscramble a
  conversation; the key, stored as two individual strings of numbers, will
  be held by separate agencies of the Commerce and Treasury Departments.
      But a number of businesses, including IBM and Microsoft, have
  opposed the chip because they say it will inhibit global trade  -
  foreign governments will assume that the chip's backdoor will be
  routinely used for espionage.
      And that same backdoor could make it easier for the government to
  monitor its citizens than ever before, say the EFF and others.
       Here's why: The chip will become entrenched in the information
  highway, the coming network of telephone, cable wireless networks,
  Barlow said. Most people believe that that highway will move
  communication  -   video, voice, text  -  in uniform bursts of zeros and
  ones called packets. One feature of packet networks is they can
  typically be monitored, by a network administrator, from any computer on
  the network. That's what happened last week on the Internet, the best
  example of a packet network, when intruders used "network sniffing"
  software to capture passwords.
      And that's why privacy  -  unbreakable encryption  -  is so
  important on packet networks, experts say. But the Clipper chip
  introduces encryption with a known weakness: the backdoor.
      Currently, if a police agency wants to eavesdrop, say, on a Brooklyn
  resident, it must get a court order. Then it must go to a New York
  Telephone office in midtown Manhattan, where a wiretap is installed. But
  on the information highway of the future, theoretically, that same
  police agency may be able to eavesdrop from its own office. Or from an
  officer's home. Or from anywhere  -  without the watchful eyes of an
  outside corporation.
      And that's why the EFF has decided to fight, said Barlow.
      The Washington, D.C.-based organization has been working closely
  with top technology officials in the administration on designing a
  blueprint for the National Information Infrastructure, the official name
  for the information highway. Now EFF and another organization, Computer
  Professionals for Social Responsibility, hope to launch the biggest
  letter-writing assault the government ever saw, using the Internet, a
  key portion of that highway. The estimated 15 million network users will
  be asked to sign a form letter and e-mail it to EFF headquarters, where
  it will be printed out and delivered to the White House.
      "We're going to the mattresses on this," Barlow said. <p>

1994-02-07 United States FY95 Budget in Electronic Format <p>

THE BUDGET OF THE UNITED STATES
                    NOW IN ELECTRONIC FORMAT
                           Background <p>

The U.S. Department of Commerce in cooperation with the Office of
Management and Budget(OMB) will produce the Budget of the United
States Government, Fiscal Year 1995 in electronic format using
compact disc-read only memory (CD-ROM) and on-line computer
delivery methods.  This marks the first time the entire budget
has been available to the public in electronic format.  Budget
analysts, public policy researchers, state and local governments,
libraries, and other members of the public will find the
electronic version to be a useful addition and versatile
alternative to the printed version of the budget.  Users will be
able to display exact images of the printed budget, search for
the occurrence of keywords within the text, and copy  or print
desired portions of the text for further reference or use.  And,
the same documents will be accessible on personal computers
running three popular operating systems -- MS-DOS, Windows, and
Apple Macintosh -- thereby making this information available to
the vast majority of personal computer users. <p>

Tentative talks on producing an electronic version of the federal
budget were first conducted between technical staff at OMB and
Commerce's Office of Business Analysis (OBA) in December, 1993.
Several factors made this effort feasible.  First, commercial
software products became available in 1993 that facilitate the
electronic transfer or delivery of finished documents.  Creators
of highly formatted documents originally intended for print
distribution could now distribute electronic copies of the same
documents with the original print format characters intact.
Recipients of the electronic documents could see exact replicas
of the original formatted text on their computers without the
need to own a copy of the software that originally created the
document.  These programs greatly facilitate the creation of
electronic catalogs, books, and other large information
collections where formatted text is important. <p>

Second, OMB uses electronic text composition software that
creates PostScript formatted output that is used by the
Government Printing Office to produce the printed version of the
budget.  One portable document delivery software product , Adobe
Acrobat uses PostScript formatted documents as the input to
create Portable Document Format (PDF) files, which may be read by
low-cost readers also distributed by Adobe.  Given that the
original budget documents are already in PostScript format, it is
a relatively simple matter to convert them to PDF format and
distribute them in electronic form. <p>

Third, the proper mix of skills and services existed on the
Commerce/OMB team to bring this project to completion in a very
tight time frame; this project was conceived, implemented, and
delivered in 50 days.  OMB prepared the budget in the proper
format and acquired and learned to use the Acrobat software
necessary to create the PDF files.  OBA had significant
experience in producing CD-ROM titles and offering information
through other electronic distribution channels such as dial-up
bulletin boards and the Internet, had staff in place to produce
the budget CD-ROM quickly, was prepared to offer telephone
ordering to ensure prompt delivery to the public, and could
provide customer support. <p>

Finally, the new spirit of the federal government encourages
agencies to take advantage of electronic tools to broaden access
to federal information.  New innovative methods to deliver
government services to the citizen at low cost both to the
government and the recipient are actively encouraged.  The
Commerce Department is taking a lead role in this endeavor.  In
short, the technical and organizational chemistry was just right
to ensure success of this project. <p>

Electronic Versions of the Budget <p>

CD-ROM <p>

The CD-ROM versions of the Budget of the United States
Government, Fiscal Year 1995 will be available to the public at
the same time the printed budget is submitted to the Congress by
President Clinton.  The CD-ROM will contain exact page-image
replicas of the same documents submitted to Congress.  These
include: <p>

o Budget of the United States Government, Fiscal Year 1995
o Budget of the United States Government, Fiscal Year 1995,
  Analytical Perspectives
o Budget of the United States Government, Fiscal Year 1995,
  Historical Tables
o Budget System and Concepts of the United States Government <p>

The Budget CD-ROM will be available for order from the Department
of Commerce after official release for $30.00, $24 less than the
comparable printed volumes.  Discs will be available for pickup,
by first class mail, and via overnight delivery ($10 additional.)
The CD-ROM will include the budget documents as well as copies of
the Adobe Acrobat Reader for MS-DOS and Windows operating
systems.  A set of diskettes containing the Acrobat Reader will
be supplied to users of Macintosh computers. <p>

A supplemental volume, the Budget of the United States
Government, Fiscal Year 1995, Appendix contains the detailed
budget submissions for each agency.  It will be transmitted to
Congress later in February and will not appear on the Budget CD-
ROM.  However, the complete Budget including the Appendix will
appear on the February 1994 issue of Commerce's National
Economic, Social, and Environmental Data Bank (NESE-DB) CD-ROM
which will be available in late February.  In addition to the
Budget, NESE-DB will contain PDF images of current Internal
Revenue Service tax forms which may be reproduced exactly as the
original printed forms and over 100,000 documents containing a
core set of economic, social and environmental data.  Information
on the NESE-DB covers issues of widespread public interest such
as Vice President Gore's National Performance Review and the
Administration's proposed Health Care Reform legislation. <p>

o NESE-DB is published quarterly in the months of February, May,
  August, and November.  Single issues are available for $95, an
  annual subscription costs $360.  Purchasers of the original
  Budget CD-ROM will be given full credit for their original
  order and may obtain the February issue of NESE-DB for the
  discounted price of $65.  Customers must mention they
  purchased the Budget CD-ROM when ordering the NESE-DB to
  obtain the discount. <p>

NESE-DB is also available for free public access in 960 federal
depository libraries located throughout the Nation. <p>

Dial-up Bulletin Board <p>

ASCII versions of the Budget documents will be available on the
Commerce Department's Economic Bulletin Board (EBB) shortly after
official release to the public.  PDF and ASCII versions of the
Budget Appendix will be added to the bulletin board when they are
released by OMB.  There will be no charge for obtaining Budget
documents via the Economic Bulletin Board.  The EBB may be
accessed using a personal computer and modem by calling: <p>

2400 BPS :   1-202-482-3870 (N81)
  9600 BPS:    1-202-482-2167 (N81) <p>

Users accessing the PDF versions of the Budget via the EBB must
supply their own copy of software capable of reading PDF files. <p>

Internet <p>

Free access to the Budget documents in PDF and ASCII forms will
also be available via the Internet.  The Internet version of the
EBB may be accessed by using the command <p>

telnet ebb.stat-usa <p>

These files will also be available for gopher access by issuing
the command. <p>

gopher gopher.esa.doc.gov <p>

As in the case of the EBB users accessing the PDF versions of the
Budget via the Internet must supply their own copy of software
capable of reading PDF files. <p>

Speaker for 17 feb ATTENDANCE MANDITORY (if weather allows) <p>

"The Information Infrastructure: New
Challenges to Privacy Protection' <p>

Privacy protection may be the single greatest
challenge facing the developers of the national
information infrastructure.  New technologies
and new business practices raise difficult and
far-reaching questions about identity, anonymity
and  personal freedom in the information age.  Policy
makers must soon define the the privacy rules for
the information highways. <p>

Marc Rotenberg is the director of Computer
Professionals for Social Responsibility (CPSR),
a public interest organization.  He frequently
testifies in Congress on issues involving
technology and civil liberties, and has served
on national and international panels concerned
with privacy protection. <p>

Re: How much privacy? [ I think this illuminates the issues very well ... djf] <p>

Trotter writes: <p>

&gt; The government's argument, I take it, is that the benefit is
&gt; law enforcement.  That strikes me as at least as great a benefit
&gt; as minimum wage laws; perhaps more, since it protects everybody
&gt; (at least in theory), whereas min wage laws primarily benefit
&gt; their recipients.  Maybe EPA regs are the better analogy:
&gt; everybody gets reduced pollution; with Clipper, everybody gets
&gt; reduced criminal activity.  Is that not a reasonable trade-off? <p>

The problem is that the government refuses to be forthcoming as to what
kind of trade-off we're talking about. There are supposedly fewer than
1000 state and federal wiretaps per year. Yet we are being asked to
reconstruct the phone system and to risk billions of dollars in trade
losses when there has never been shown to be any crime associated with
uncrackable encryption whatsoever. <p>

Moreover, there are fundamental political issues at stake. This country
was founded on a principle of restraints on government. A system in which
the privacy of our communications is contingent on the good faith of the
government, which holds all the encryption keys, flies in the face of what
we have been taught to believe about the structure of government and the
importance of individual liberty. <p>

In short, the government fails to make its case in two separate
ways--pragmatically and philosophically. <p>

&gt; In reply to the latter issue, I don't think the government
&gt; cares whether an accountant in India can password protect a
&gt; spreadsheet.  I would guess that even Clipper or DES or whatver
&gt; would be more than enough protection for such a person. I think
&gt; the government cares that it be able to detect foreign
&gt; intelligence that is relevant to US security or interests. I am
&gt; not sure where I come out on the question, but at the very
&gt; least it seems to me that the government is reasonable in this
&gt; desire. <p>

Yet there are some premises here that need to be questioned. Do we really
suppose that "foreign intelligence" is dependent on the American software
industry to develop its encryption tools? Diffie-Helman public-key
encryption and DES are already available worldwide, yet
Microsoft can't export software that contains either form of encryption. <p>

No, the real issue is that, to the extent that a mass market arises for
encryption products, it makes the NSA's job more difficult, and it may
at some future time make some investigations more difficult as well. <p>

When asked to quantify the problem, the government invariably begs off.
Government spokespeople say "Well, how would you feel if there were a
murder-kidnapping that we couldn't solve because of encryption?" To which
my answer is, "Well, I'd feel about the same way that I'd feel if there
were a murder-kidnapping that couldn't be solved because of the privilege
against self-incrimination." <p>

Which is to say, I understand that limits on government power entail
a loss in efficiency of law-enforcement investigations and
intelligence-agency operations. Nevertheless, there is a fundamental
choice we have to make about what kind of society we want to live in.
Open societies, and societies that allow individual privacy, are
*less safe*. But we have been taught to value liberty more highly
than safety, and I think that's a lesson well-learned. <p>

What's more, we need to be able to rational risk assessment, and that's
something that the government resists. The government subscribes to
the reasoning of Pascal's Wager. Pascal, you may recall, argued that the
rational man is a Christian, even if the chances that Christianity is true
are small. His reasoning is quasi-mathematical--even if the chances of
Christianity's truth are small, the consequences of choosing not to
be a Christian are (if that choice is incorrect) infinitely terrible.
Eternal torment, demons, flames, the whole works. <p>

This is precisely the same way that the government talks about nuclear
terrorism and murder-kidnappings. When asked what the probability is
of a) a nuclear terrorist, who b) decides to use encryption, and c)
manages otherwise to thwart counterterrorist efforts, they'll answer
"What does it matter what the probability is? Even one case is too
much to risk!" <p>

But we can't live in a society that defines its approach to civil liberties
in terms of infinitely bad but low-probability events. Open societies
are risky. Individual freedom and privacy are risky. If we are to make a
mature commitment to an open society, we have to acknowledge those risks
up front, and reaffirm our willingness to endure them. <p>

Reps. Markey and Fields attack Emmanuel Goldstein <p>

The latest issue of CuD has a transcript from a House Subcommittee on
Telecommunications and Finance hearing from last June.  Here are some
excerpts. <p>

Mr. MARKEY. Thank you, Mr. Guidry, very much.
     We will take questions now from the subcommittee members.
     Let me begin, Mr. Delaney. I would like you and Mr. Goldstein
to engage in a conversation, if we could. This is Mr. Goldstein's
magazine, "The Hacker Quarterly: 2600," and for $4 we could go out
to Tower Records here in the District of Columbia and purchase
this. It has information in it that, from my perspective, is very
troubling in terms of people's cellular phone numbers and
information on how to crack through into people's private
information.
     Now you have got some problems with "The Hacker Quarterly,"
Mr. Delaney.
     Mr. DELANEY. Yes, sir.
     Mr. MARKEY. And your problem is, among other things, that
teenagers can get access to this and go joy riding into people's
private records. <p>

... <p>

Mr. MARKEY. Well, I don't know. You are being a little bit
disingenuous here, Mr. Goldstein. Here, on page 17 of your spring
edition of 1993, "How to build a pay TV descrambler." Now that is
illegal.
     Mr. GOLDSTEIN. Not building. Building one is not illegal.
     Mr. MARKEY. Oh, using one is illegal?
     Mr. GOLDSTEIN. Exactly.
     Mr. MARKEY. I see. So showing a teenager, or anyone, how to
build a pay TV descrambler is not illegal. But what would they do
then, use it as an example of their technological prowess that they
know how to build one? Would there not be a temptation to use it,
Mr. Goldstein? <p>

... <p>

Mr. GOLDSTEIN. Most likely, yes. But the thing is, we don't
believe that because something could be used in a bad way, that is
a reason to stifle the knowledge that goes into it.
     Mr. MARKEY. That is the only way this could be used. Is there
a good way in which a pay TV descrambler could be used that is a
legal way?
     Mr. GOLDSTEIN. Certainly, to understand how the technology
works in the first place, to design a way of defeating such devices
in the future or to build other electronic devices based on that
technology.
     Mr. MARKEY. I appreciate that, but it doesn't seem to me that
most of the subscribers to "2600" magazine -- [interruption - damn, I
*really* want to know what he was going to say - shari] <p>

... <p>

MARKEY.     ...Similarly here, we assume that there is a certain percentage
of pathologically damaged people out there. The cerebral mechanism
doesn't quite work in parallel with the rest of society. We have to
pass laws to protect the rest of us against them. We will call them
criminal hackers. What do we do to deal with them is the question
that we are going to be confronted with in the course of our
hearings?
     Let me recognize the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Fields.
     Mr. FIELDS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
     Just for my own edification, Mr. Goldstein, you appear to be
intelligent; you have your magazine, so obviously you are
entrepreneurial. For me personally, I would like to know, why don't
you channel the curiosity that you talk about into something that
is positive for society? And, I'm going to have to say to you, I
don't think it is positive when you invade someone else's privacy.
     Mr. GOLDSTEIN. I agree. <p>

... <p>

Mr. FIELDS. Mr. Guidry, one last question. Is it the Secret
Service that is at the forefront of Federal activity?
     Mr. GUIDRY. Yes, sir, it is.
     Mr. FIELDS. Do they have the resources to adequately deal with
this problem?
     Mr. GUIDRY. No, sir. The problem is growing so rapidly that
they are undermanned in this area but have asked for additional
manpower.
     Mr. FIELDS. Is this a priority for the Secret Service?
     Mr. GUIDRY. Yes, sir, it is. <p>

You may want to read more.

Dorothy Denning answers  Campaign and Petition Against Clipper <p>

Date: Wed, 09 Feb 1994 17:23:28 -0500 (EST)
From: denning@cs.cosc.georgetown.edu (Dorothy Denning)
Subject: Re: Campaign and Petition Against Clipper <p>

CPSR has announced a petition campaign to oppose the Clipper initiative.  I
would like to caution people about signing the petition.  The issues are
extremely complex and difficult.  The Clipper initiative is the result of
considerable deliberation by many intelligent people who appreciate and
understand the concerns that have been expressed and who worked hard to
accommodate the conflicting interests.  The decisions that have been made were
not made lightly. <p>

I would like to respond to some of the statements that CPSR has made
about Clipper in their campaign and petition letters: <p>

The Clipper proposal, developed in secret by the National Security
     Agency, is a technical standard that will make it easier for
     government agents to wiretap the emerging data highway. <p>

The standard (FIPS 185) is not a standard for the Internet or any other high
speed computer network.  It is for the telephone system.  Quoting from FIPS
185: "Data for purposes of this standard includes voice, facsimile and
computer information communicated in a telephone system.  A telephone system
for purposes of this standard is limited to a system which is circuit switched
and operating at data rates of standard commercial modems over analog voice
circuits or which uses basic-rate ISDN or a similar grade wireless service." <p>

The standard will not make it any easier to tap phones, let alone
computer networks.  All it will do is make it technically possible to
decrypt communications that are encrypted with the standard, assuming
the communications are not superencrypted with something else.  Law
enforcers still need to get a court order just to intercept the
communications in the first place, and advances in technology have made
interception itself more difficult.  The standard will make it much
harder for anyone to conduct illegal taps, including the government. <p>

The purpose of the standard is to provide a very strong encryption algorithm -
something much stronger than DES - and to do so in a way that does not thwart
law enforcement and national security objectives.  Keys are escrowed so that
if someone uses this technology, they cannot use it against national
interests. <p>

Industry groups, professional associations and civil liberties
     organizations have expressed almost unanimous opposition to the
     plan since it was first proposed in April 1993. <p>

"The public does not like Clipper and will not accept it ..." <p>

The private sector and the public have expressed nearly unanimous
     opposition to Clipper. <p>

As near as I know, neither CPSR nor any other group has conducted any
systematic poll of industry, professional societies, or the public.  While
many people have voiced opposition, there are many more organizations and
people who have been silent on this issue.  The ACM is in the process of
conducting a study on encryption.  CPSR is a member of the study group, as am
I.  Steve Kent is chair.  Our goal is a report that will articulate the
issues, not a public statement either for or against.  The International
Association for Cryptologic Research has not to my knowledge made any official
statement about Clipper. <p>

The Administration ignored the overwhelming opposition of the
     general public. When the Commerce Department solicited public
     comments on the proposal last fall, hundreds of people opposed the
     plan while only a few expressed support. <p>

Hundreds of people is hardly overwhelming in a population of 250 million,
especially when most of the letters were the same and came in through the net
following a sample letter that was sent out. <p>

The technical standard is subject to misuse and compromise. It
     would provide government agents with copies of the keys that
     protect electronic communications. "It is a nightmare for computer
     security." <p>

I have been one of the reviewers of the standard.  We have completed our
review of the encryption algorithm, SKIPJACK, and concluded it was very
strong.  While we have not completed our review of the key escrow system, from
what I have seen so far, I anticipate that it will provide an extremely high
level of security for the escrowed keys. <p>

The underlying technology was developed in secret by the NSA, an
     intelligence agency responsible for electronic eavesdropping, not
     privacy protection. Congressional investigations in the 1970s
     disclosed widespread NSA abuses, including the illegal
     interception of millions of cables sent by American citizens. <p>

NSA is also responsible for the development of cryptographic codes to protect
the nation's most sensitive classified information.  They have an excellent
track record in conducting this mission.  I do not believe that our
requirements for protecting private information are greater than those for
protecting classified information.  I do not know the facts of the 1970s
incident that is referred to here, but it sounds like it occurred before
passage of the 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.  This act requires
intelligence agencies to get a court order in order to intercept
communications of American citizens.  I am not aware of any recent evidence
that the NSA is engaging in illegal intercepts of Americans. <p>

Computer security experts question the integrity of the
     technology.  Clipper was developed in secret and its
     specifications are classified. <p>

The 5 of us who reviewed the algorithm unanimously agreed that it was very
strong.  We will publish a final report when we complete or full evaluation.
Nothing can be concluded from a statement questioning the technology by
someone who has not seen it regardless of whether that person is an expert in
security. <p>

NSA overstepped its legal authority in developing the standard.  A
     1987 law explicitly limits the intelligence agency's power to set
     standards for the nation's communications network. <p>

The 1987 Computer Security Act states that NIST "shall draw on the technical
advice and assistance (including work products) of the National Security
Agency." <p>

There is no evidence to support law enforcement's claims that new
     technologies are hampering criminal investigations. CPSR recently
     forced the release of FBI documents that show no such problems. <p>

CPSR obtained some documents from a few FBI field offices.  Those offices
reported no problems.  CPSR did not get reports from all field offices and did
not get reports from local law enforcement agencies.  I can tell you that it
is a fact that new communications technologies, including encryption, have
hampered criminal investigations.  I personally commend law enforcement for
trying to get out in front of this problem. <p>

If the plan goes forward, commercial firms that hope to develop
     new products will face extensive government obstacles.
     Cryptographers who wish to develop new privacy enhancing
     technologies will be discouraged. <p>

The standard is voluntary -- even for the government. <p>

Mr. Rotenberg said "We want the public to understand the full
     implications of this plan.  Today it is only a few experts and
     industry groups that understand the proposal. <p>

I support this objective.  Unfortunately, it is not possible for most of us to
be fully informed of the national security implications of uncontrolled
encryption.  For very legitimate reasons, these cannot be fully discussed and
debated in a public forum.  It is even difficult to talk about the full
implications of encryption on law enforcement.  This is why it is important
that the President and Vice-President be fully informed on all the issues, and
for the decisions to be made at that level.  The Feb. 4 decision was made
following an inter-agency policy review, headed by the National Security
Council, that examined these issues using considerable input from industry,
CPSR, EFF, and individuals as well as from law enforcement and intelligence
agencies.  In the absence of understanding the national security issues, I
believe we need to exercise some caution in believing that we can understand
the full implications of encryption on society. <p>

As part of the Feb. 4 announcement, the Administration announced the
establishment of an Interagency Working Group on Encryption and
Telecommunications, chaired by the White House Office of Science and
Technology Policy and National Security Council, with representatives from
Commerce, Justice, State, Treasury, FBI, NSA, OMB, and the National Economic
Council.  The group is to work with industry and public interest groups to
develop new encryption technologies and to review and refine encryption
policy.  The NRC's Computer Science and Telecommunications Board will also be
conducting a study of encryption policy. <p>

These comments may be distributed. <p>

Encrypting filesystem for DOS/Windows available [ an example of externally available systems .. djf] <p>

From: pgut1@cs.aukuni.ac.nz
Subject: Encrypting filesystem for DOS/Windows available
Date: 10 Feb 1994 11:58:55 GMT
Organization: University of Auckland <p>

I have just released the latest beta of SFS, my secure filesystem for DOS and
Windows (and a few operating systems too eventually, if I get the time).  It's
available as: <p>

ftp.informatik.uni-hamburg.de:/pub/virus/incoming/sfs_97.zip <p>

and is about 190K as is, or 510K decompressed.  You can't see the incoming
directory contents on this site, so just cd to /pub/virus/incoming and get
sfs97.zip, even if it looks as if there's nothing there. <p>

This is still a beta release (thus the obscure distribution method), it is
STRONGLY RECOMMENDED that you read the file readme.1st included in the
distribution before doing anything else.  Hopefully this will be the final beta
before the actual release. <p>

SFS has the following features: <p>

- The current implementation runs as a standard DOS device driver, and
    therefore works with plain old DOS as well as other software such as
    Windows, QEMM, Share, disk cacheing software, and so on. <p>

- Up to five encrypted volumes can be accessed at any one time, chosen from
    a selection of as many volumes as there is storage for. <p>

- Volumes can be quickly unmounted with a user-defined hotkey, or
    automatically unmounted after a certain amount of time.  They can also be
    converted back to unencrypted volumes or have their contents destroyed if
    required. <p>

- The encryption algorithms used have been selected to be free from any
    patent restrictions, and the software itself is not covered by US export
    restrictions as it was developed entirely outside the US (although once a
    copy is sent into the US it can't be re-exported). <p>

- SFS complies with a number of national and international data encryption
    standards, among them ANSI X3.106, Federal Information Processing Standard
    (FIPS) 180, Australian Standard 2805.5.2, ISO 10116:1991 and ISO
    10126-2:1991, and is on nodding terms with a several other relevant
    standards. <p>

- The documentation includes fairly in-depth analyses of various security
    aspects of the software, as well as complete design and programming details
    necessary to both create SFS-compatible software and to verify the
    algorithms used in SFS. <p>

- Reasonable throughput.  One beta-tester has reported a throughput of 170
    K/s for the basic version and 185 K/s for the 486+ version on his 486
    system when copying a file with the DOS copy command from one location on
    an SFS volume to another (I get about 90 K/s on my vanilla 386 box). <p>

Subject: Re: Campaign and Petition Against Clipper (Denning, RISKS-15.48) <p>

In RISKS-15.48, 9 Feb 1994, Dorothy Denning states: <p>

&gt;As near as I know, neither CPSR nor any other group has conducted any
&gt;systematic poll of industry, professional societies, or the public.  While
&gt;many people have voiced opposition, there are many more organizations and
&gt;people who have been silent on this issue.  The ACM is in the process of
&gt;conducting a study on encryption.  CPSR is a member of the study group, as am
&gt;I.  Steve Kent is chair.  Our goal is a report that will articulate the
&gt;issues, not a public statement either for or against.  The International
&gt;Association for Cryptologic Research has not to my knowledge made any official
&gt;statement about Clipper. <p>

I am chair of USACM, which is the new U.S. Public Policy Committee of ACM.
A few months ago we asked Steve Kent to chair a panel that would study
encryption policy in the U.S. and produce a report for ACM.  As Dorothy
mentions, she is on the panel, together with several other illustrious
individuals, including the esteemed moderator of RISKS.  I have included the
list of panelists at the end of this note.  CPSR is no more a member of the
panel than are the National Security Agency or the Department of Justice.
The panel does have members who are affiliated with all three organizations. <p>

I am certain that Dorothy did not intend to give the impression that the
ACM panel has decided that ACM will not have a public position on Clipper.
However, since her email might have been misinterpreted by some readers,
I want to clarify that, while ACM has not taken a position on Clipper,
there has not been any decision made within ACM of which I am aware that
prevents ACM from taking a position at some future time.  In addition,
it is my understanding that there has been no final determination made by
the panel of precisely what the report will or will not contain. <p>

Barbara Simons, Chair USACM <p>

The members of the ACM encryption policy panel are: <p>

Dr. Clint Brooks, National Security Agency
  Scott Charney, Department of Justice
  Dr. Dorothy Denning, Georgetown University
  Dr. Whitfield Diffie, Sun Microsystems Inc.
  Dr. Anthony Lauck, Digital Equipment Corporation
  Douglas Miller, Software Publishers Association
  Dr. Peter Neumann, SRI International

Subject: Re: CPSR Clipper Campaign <p>

Dorothy Denning has raised important questions about the Clipper proposal.  As
she says "the issues are extremely complex and difficult."  Below I've tried
to answer the points she has raised.  I apologize in advance to RISKS readers
who know all of this. <p>

Please read her comments and my response.  Speak with others interested in the
Clipper proposal.  If on balance, after reviewing the arguments, you decide
Clipper is a mistake then you should express your opposition by sending a
message to: <p>

CLIPPER.PETITION@CPSR.ORG <p>

with the words <p>

"I oppose Clipper" <p>

in the subject header.  If you have already signed the petition, ask a friend
or colleague to sign. <p>

Your help is needed. <p>

Marc Rotenberg, director, CPSR Washington office <p>

&gt;&gt;  The Clipper proposal, developed in secret by the
&gt;&gt;  National Security Agency, is a technical standard
&gt;&gt;  that will make it easier for government agents to
&gt;&gt;  wiretap the emerging data highway. <p>

&gt;  The standard (FIPS 185) is not a standard for the
&gt;  Internet or any other high speed computer network.  It
&gt;  is for the telephone system. <p>

The letter to the President makes clear that we are concerned about "Clipper
and associated standards" which include the Capstone EES configuration for
data transmission. <p>

It is clearly the intent of the EES proposal to cover both voice and data
transmissions. <p>

&gt;  The standard will not make it any easier to tap phones,
&gt;  let alone computer networks.  All it will do is make it
&gt;  technically possible to decrypt communications that are
&gt;  encrypted with the standard, assuming the communications
&gt;  are not superencrypted with something else. <p>

This is a little bit like saying that leaving a master key for every house on
your block with the police will not make it easier for the police to open
locked doors. <p>

We may disagree about whether this is a good idea, but let's be clear about
the intent of the proposal. <p>

&gt;  The purpose of the standard is to provide a very strong
&gt;  encryption algorithm - something much stronger than DES
&gt;  - and to do so in a way that does not thwart law
&gt;  enforcement and national security objectives.  Keys are
&gt;  escrowed so that if someone uses this technology, they
&gt;  cannot use it against national interests. <p>

The NSA is responsible for foreign signal interception.  It has no legal
authority to conduct wire surveillance.  What are the NSA's "national
security" interests in domestic wire surveillance? <p>

&gt;&gt;  Industry groups, professional associations and
&gt;&gt;  civil liberties organizations have expressed almost
&gt;&gt;  unanimous opposition to the plan since it was first
&gt;&gt;  proposed in April 1993. <p>

&gt;&gt;  The private sector and the public have expressed
&gt;&gt;  nearly unanimous opposition to Clipper. <p>

&gt;  As near as I know, neither CPSR nor any other group has
&gt;  conducted any systematic poll of industry, professional
&gt;  societies, or the public. <p>

To the best of my knowledge, there has never been a proposed technical
standard that generated more opposition.  Firms across the telecommunications
and computer industry oppose Clipper.  Computer security people and
cryptographers oppose Clipper.  Privacy experts oppose Clipper. <p>

&gt;&gt;  The Administration ignored the overwhelming
&gt;&gt;  opposition of the general public. When the Commerce
&gt;&gt;  Department solicited public comments on the
&gt;&gt;  proposal last fall, hundreds of people opposed the
&gt;  plan while only a few expressed support. <p>

&gt;  Hundreds of people is hardly overwhelming in a
&gt;  population of 250 million, especially when most of the
&gt;  letters were the same and came in through the net
&gt;  following a sample letter that was sent out. <p>

I would encourage Dorothy, or anyone else, to take a poll of any
representative user group -- RISKS readers perhaps -- if there is any doubt
about how the public feels about the proposal. <p>

&gt;&gt;  The technical standard is subject to misuse and
&gt;&gt;  compromise. It would provide government agents with
&gt;&gt;  copies of the keys that protect electronic
&gt;&gt;  communications. "It is a nightmare for computer
&gt;&gt;  security." <p>

&gt;  I have been one of the reviewers of the standard.  We
&gt;  have completed our review of the encryption algorithm,
&gt;  SKIPJACK, and concluded it was very strong.  While we
&gt;  have not completed our review of the key escrow system,
&gt;  from what I have seen so far, I anticipate that it will
&gt;  provide an extremely high level of security for the
&gt;  escrowed keys. <p>

Dorothy endorsed the proposal before she joined the "review" team.  The group
that she refers to, a White House task force, has an interesting history.  The
majority of cryptographers asked to participate declined. <p>

&gt;&gt;  The underlying technology was developed in secret
&gt;&gt;  by the NSA, an intelligence agency responsible for
&gt;&gt;  electronic eavesdropping, not privacy protection.
&gt;&gt;  Congressional investigations in the 1970s disclosed
&gt;&gt;  widespread NSA abuses, including the illegal
&gt;&gt;  interception of millions of cables sent by American
&gt;&gt;  citizens. <p>

&gt;  NSA is also responsible for the development of
&gt;  cryptographic codes to protect the nation's most
&gt;  sensitive classified information.  They have an
&gt;  excellent track record in conducting this mission. <p>

Senator Frank Church, who conducted the most extensive hearings ever held on
the National Security Agency, said that the NSA's intelligence gathering
capabilities were important for the security of the United States.  He also
said that the massive eavesdropping capability created "A tremendous potential
for abuse." If ever turned against the communications system of the United
States: <p>

no American would have any privacy left . . . there
  would be no place to hide. <p>

We must see to it that this agency and all agencies
  that possess this technology operate within the law and
  under proper supervision, so that we never cross
  over that abyss.  That is an abyss from which there
  is no return. " (NBC Meet the Press, 1975) <p>

&gt;&gt;  Computer security experts question the integrity of
&gt;&gt; the technology. Clipper was developed in secret and
&gt;&gt;  its specifications are classified. <p>

&gt;  The 5 of us who reviewed the algorithm unanimously
&gt;  agreed that it was very strong.  We will publish a final
&gt;  report when we complete or full evaluation. Nothing can
&gt;  be concluded from a statement questioning the technology
&gt;  by someone who has not seen it regardless of whether
&gt;  that person is an expert in security. <p>

The original CPSR letter to the President, asking for the withdrawal of
Clipper, was signed by Hellman, Rivest, Diffie, Merkle, and others.  Many more
experts are adding their names daily to the CPSR petition. <p>

&gt;&gt;  NSA overstepped its legal authority in developing
&gt;&gt;  the standard.  A 1987 law explicitly limits the
&gt;&gt;  intelligence agency's power to set standards for
&gt;&gt;  the nation's communications network. <p>

&gt;  The 1987 Computer Security Act states that NIST "shall
&gt;  draw on the technical advice and assistance (including
&gt;  work products) of the National Security Agency." <p>

The original replacement for DES, proposed by the Department of Commerce in
1989, would have had these characteristics: <p>

-- public, unclassified
-- implementable in both hardware or software
-- usable by federal Agencies and U.S. based multi-national corporation
-- a level of security sufficient for the protection of unclassified,
   sensitive information and commercial propriety and/or valuable information. <p>

The final proposal, developed with the "technical assistance" of the NSA, has
these characteristics. <p>

-- The Clipper algorithm Skipjack is classified
-- Public access to the reasons underlying the proposal is restricted
-- Skipjack can be implemented only in tamper-proof hardware
-- It will not be used by multi-national corporations
-- The security of the configuration remains unproven. <p>

The Computer Security Act was passed precisely because the NSA tried
previously to grab civilian computer security turf.  The law was specifically
intended to control the type of abuse that results from secret
standard-setting arrangements. <p>

If there any doubt among RISKS readers about the illegal activities of the NSA
in the development of the EES, please consult the minutes of the NSA/NIST
Technical Working Group (TWG) that produced the standard.  The minutes should
be available from the National Security Agency Public Information Office.
That phone number is 301/688-6524. <p>

&gt;&gt;  There is no evidence to support law enforcement's
&gt;&gt;  claims that new technologies are hampering criminal
&gt;&gt;  investigations. CPSR recently forced the release of
&gt;&gt;  FBI documents that show no such problems. <p>

&gt;  CPSR obtained some documents from a few FBI field
&gt;  offices.  Those offices reported no problems.  CPSR did
&gt;  not get reports from all field offices and did not get
&gt;  reports from local law enforcement agencies.  I can tell
&gt;  you that it is a fact that new communications
&gt;  technologies, including encryption, have hampered
&gt;  criminal investigations. <p>

The statement is illogical.  There is still no evidence to support the FBI's
claims. <p>

The FBI made certain claims that cryptography was impeding criminal
investigation conducted by wiretap.  CPSR investigated the FBI's claims by
filing a Freedom of Information Act suit to obtain the relevant documents.
The documents provided to us by the Department of Justice revealed that none
of the FBI field officers had encountered any obstacles.  The Department of
Justice has just informed us that they provided to us all relevant documents
concerning the Clipper proposal. <p>

There is one reported case where cryptography made it difficult for law
enforcement to obtain evidence. That case concerned reading the contents of a
file on a hard disk after it was seized. <p>

If this is the problem that the Clipper proposal is intended to solve, then
the key escrow scheme must be extended to every single encrypted file -- not
just encrypted communications -- everywhere in the world. <p>

Every encrypted file. Everywhere. <p>

&gt;&gt;  If the plan goes forward, commercial firms that
&gt;&gt;  hope to develop new products will face extensive
&gt;&gt;  government obstacles. Cryptographers who wish to
&gt;&gt;  develop new privacy enhancing technologies will be
&gt;&gt;  discouraged. <p>

&gt;  The standard is voluntary -- even for the government. <p>

An FBI legislative proposal now under consideration at the White House would
mandate a Clipper-like scheme.  That proposal is backed by fines up to $10,000
per day and jail time. <p>

That's not voluntary. <p>

&gt;&gt;  Mr. Rotenberg said "We want the public to
&gt;&gt;  understand the full implications of this plan.
&gt;&gt;  Today it is only a few experts and  industry groups
&gt;&gt;  that understand the proposal. <p>

&gt;  I support this objective.  Unfortunately, it is not
&gt;  possible for most of us to be fully informed of the
&gt;  national security implications of uncontrolled
&gt;  encryption.  For very legitimate reasons, these cannot
&gt;  be fully discussed and debated in a public forum. <p>

This assertion has never been supported by evidence.  It has been used simply
to stifle criticism. <p>

&gt;  The Feb. 4 decision was made
&gt;  following an inter-agency policy review, headed by the
&gt;  National Security Council, that examined these issues
&gt;  using considerable input from industry, CPSR, EFF, and
&gt;  individuals as well as from law enforcement and
&gt;  intell <p>

CPSR did not participate in the inter-agency policy review.  Our position from
the very beginning is that these decisions must be made openly. <p>

&gt;  In the absence of understanding
&gt;  the national security issues, I believe we need to
&gt;  exercise some caution in believing that we can
&gt;  understand the full implications of encryption on
&gt;  society. <p>

This premise, if accepted, would mean that people in the United States would
have no right to express political views when the government claimed "national
security." Certainly, there are matters of national security that must be
protected, but when an agency with expertise in wire surveillance develops a
secret standard for eavesdropping and tells those who raise questions that
there are matters of national security that they would not understand, there
is good reason for concern. <p>

If you believe that Clipper is a mistake, please express your views by sending
email with the words "I oppose Clipper" in the subject header to
CLIPPER.PETITION@CPSR.ORG. <p>

[In the following messages, I have pruned back radically on the
   included repetitions of Dorothy's original message.  I hope I have not
   lost any threads...  Refer back to RISKS-15.48 if you are in doubt.  PGN] <p>

From: ugtalbot@king.mcs.drexel.edu (George T. "14K F/D" Talbot)
Subject: Re: Campaign and Petition Against Clipper <p>

I would like to comment upon a few points raised by Dr. Denning: <p>

&gt;The decisions that have been made were not made lightly. <p>

While I appreciate the sentiments expressed by Dr. Denning here, I'm
sure that those who oppose the Clipper initiative are also intelligent and
have also worked very hard to make their concerns known.  I have studied this
issue actively and I assure you that I did not sign the petition "lightly". <p>

&gt;The standard (FIPS 185) is not a standard for the Internet or any other high
&gt;speed computer network. <p>

While the Clipper initiative only covers the phone system, the entire proposal
(Clipper and Capstone and the key escrow system) will touch the high-speed
networks and should be taken as a whole. <p>

&gt;...assuming
&gt;the communications are not superencrypted with something else.  Law
&gt;enforcers still need to get a court order just to intercept the
&gt;communications in the first place... <p>

There are two points to address here.  First, it is currently very difficult
to produce and export cryptographic software of any significant strength due
to export controls.  A private entity which has the resources to produce a
strong cryptographic solution will have to invest a great deal to produce such
software.  The current export controls would make it impossible for such an
entity to compete on the world market, thus limiting profit, possibly to the
point of non-profitability.  This makes superencryption pretty unlikely, and
this is one of the purposes of the current export controls on encryption.
Also at issue is whether the government will outlaw non-Clipper/Capstone/Key
Escrow encryption entirely. <p>

Second, law enforcement needs to get a court order to intercept phone
communications.  I know of no such need to get a court order to intercept
communications on a high speed network w.r.t. Capstone.  The current
administration proposal does not require a court order to get the escrowed
keys themselves. <p>

&gt;     The Administration ignored the overwhelming opposition of the
&gt;     general public. When the Commerce Department solicited public
&gt;     comments on the proposal last fall, hundreds of people opposed the
&gt;     plan while only a few expressed support.
&gt;
&gt;Hundreds of people is hardly overwhelming in a population of 250 million,
&gt;especially when most of the letters were the same and came in through the net
&gt;following a sample letter that was sent out. <p>

Currently the community which is informed on this issue is rather small.  It
is unclear whether that population of 250 million would support the initiative
if they were fully informed.  Assuming the people which responded to the
Commerce Department solicitation is representative of the public at large,
it is clear that this is not a popular initiative outside of government/
law enforcement/national security circles. <p>

&gt;I have been one of the reviewers of the standard.  We have completed our
&gt;review of the encryption algorithm, SKIPJACK, and concluded it was very
&gt;strong.  While we have not completed our review of the key escrow system, from
&gt;what I have seen so far, I anticipate that it will provide an extremely high
&gt;level of security for the escrowed keys. <p>

I'm sure that the committee which reviewed the algorithm made as accurate
an assessment of the algorithm they could in the limited time they were given.
What the NSA refuses to answer on this point is whether it, or the rest of the
national security community will use the escrow system.  If the [national
security] community does not sign up [for the key escrow system], then the
escrow system will be effectively compromised. <p>

&gt;...I am not aware of any recent evidence
&gt;that the NSA is engaging in illegal intercepts of Americans... <p>

&gt;From what I understand, the Act was passed in response to the incident in the
1970s.  Just because one doesn't have evidence doesn't mean that abuses don't
exist, and one can't make basic policy decisions based upon that.  When
considering important policy like this, one has to actively consider the risks
of abuse. <p>

&gt;... <p>

&gt;From what current reports show, NSA pushed the proposal through NIST, and it
was NSA, not NIST, which was the true author and sponsor of the initiative.
They were operating on a "gray area" where because they were the only source
for the standard considered, they effectively set the standard without
explicitly violating the law. <p>

&gt;...  I can tell you that it
&gt;is a fact that new communications technologies, including encryption, have
&gt;hampered criminal investigations.  I personally commend law enforcement for
&gt;trying to get out in front of this problem. <p>

Dr. Denning, would you, as a service to RISKS readers, disclose your evidence <p>

what kind of investigations were hampered? <p>

&gt;the full implications of encryption on society. <p>

I disagree and Dr. Denning contradicts herself.  If the decision is made at

Subject: Clipper standard came close to being not only for phones <p>

Dorothy Denning wrote in RISKS Forum: <p>

&gt; The [Clipper] standard (FIPS 185) is not a standard for the Internet or any
&gt; other high speed computer network.  It is for the telephone system.  Quoting
&gt; from FIPS 185: "Data for purposes of this standard includes voice, facsimile <p>

It apparently came close to covering everything.  I have heard from several
people at NIST describing the general unhappiness there about the EES.  One
wrote to me: <p>

&gt; Three weeks ago, Ray Kammer {the deputy director} and Mike Rubin {the
&gt; general counsel} here told people to rewrite the FIPS 185 {the EES}, which
&gt; was in draft form, so that the standard applied to all electronic
&gt; communications, including those not covered under the then current language.
&gt; They refused, even walked out of the meeting, saying that it just could not
&gt; be done.  Ray Kammer backed down, and the FIPS went out w/o the
&gt; all-inclusive language. <p>

{remarks in curly brackets added by L Hoffman for explanation} <p>

In any case, that point may be somewhat moot because Capstone applies to data! <p>

Subject: Re: Denning's thoughts on the Clipper Chip <p>

&gt;The standard (FIPS 185) is not a standard for the Internet or any other high
&gt;speed computer network. ... <p>

The language sounds to me like it covers ISDN which is rapidly becoming the
standard for non-local networking, all switched circuits, which will soon
include most cable systems, and standard commercial modems carry the vast
majority of all current computer communications.  What do you think the
superhighway is going to be made of?  We have AT+T trying for the twisted pair
as the standard, and the cable companies going for a cable version, and some
chasing optical, but it is all circuit switched at one point or another. <p>

&gt; ...  The standard will make it much
&gt;harder for anyone to conduct illegal taps, including the government. <p>

For someone who lived through Watergate and Irangate and all the other
gates, I am amazed that you can still take this position.  It only means
that the class of people who will be able to get the information will be
restricted to the richer and more powerful.  Anyone familiar with the
telephone system today knows that to tap a line requires only that the FBI
tell the telephone company the phone number.  The rest happens in a matter
of seconds.  With clipper, it will be the same way. <p>

&gt; ...  Keys are escrowed so that if someone uses this technology, they cannot
&gt; use it against national interests. <p>

How much do these escrow agents get paid, and how well are their families
protected?  How many guards watch them continuously? Who are we kidding?
US Nuclear codes were leaked to the Soviets at the height of the cold war.
Do you really think that we will protect these escrow agents any better? <p>

&gt;As near as I know, neither CPSR nor any other group has conducted any
&gt;systematic poll ... <p>

I know for a fact that most of the major telecommunications providers are
worried that Clipper will be made the standard.  The reason is that they need
better protection and they have to be able to do more things more flexibly
than Clipper allows.  They also don't want to have to pay the company who
makes clipper a fortune to use a technology they don't want to use. <p>

&gt;Hundreds of people is hardly overwhelming in a population of 250 million ... <p>

Do you claim to believe that the great silent majority is in favor of Clipper?
Actually, hundreds of people who opposed it against only a few who supported
it would tend to indicate that 245 Million oppose it and 5 million are in
favor.  Not that this was a statistically valid sample.  After all, the people
who oppose it are probably more knowledgeable than the general public. <p>

&gt;... concluded it was very strong.  ... <p>

In the light of 5,000 years of cryptographic history where experts claimed
that systems were very strong only to find them broken soon after, I find it
hard to trust the hand picked committee of 5 so-called experts who are given
money and time to pass judgement on a technology that is so weak that they are
afraid to expose it to the light of day.  If it is so strong, why not let the
rest of the world review it? The German experts said the same thing about
Enigma, and lots of US experts said the same thing about &lt;name withheld&gt; for
national security reasons.  The infoscape is littered with failed
cryptosystems and failed experts wo trusted them. <p>

&gt;...  I do not believe that our requirements for protecting private
&gt;information are greater than those for protecting classified information.
&gt;...  I am not aware of any recent evidence that the NSA is engaging in
&gt;illegal intercepts of Americans. <p>

It is hard to believe that such a well known expert is that naive.  It is the
blind belief in government that allows it to get away with so much.  We need
more questioning, not less.  We need affirmative facts that show they are
not doing this before we will believe it.  Just because they haven't been
caught, doesn't mean they are innocent. <p>

&gt;The 5 of us who reviewed the algorithm unanimously agreed that it was very
&gt;strong.  We will publish a final report when we complete or full evaluation.
&gt;Nothing can be concluded from a statement questioning the technology by
&gt;someone who has not seen it regardless of whether that person is an expert in
&gt;security. <p>

I disagree strongly with this assertion.  The mere fact that 5 experts agree
that a technology is strong gives me no confidence whatsoever.  If it is so
strong, what's the big secret? If it's so strong, why does it have to be
protected by a special hardware mechanism? If it is so strong, why not tell
all of us so we can start to develop similar systems of our own? How can you
claim it is so strong when you are afraid to even tell us how it works?
History has shown that secret systems such as these are not strong.  The
evidence I use to condemn is 5,000 years of history.  Your evidence is 5
people in a room saying it's strong.  Which should we give more weight to? <p>

&gt;...  I can tell you that it
&gt;is a fact that new communications technologies, including encryption, have
&gt;hampered criminal investigations.  ... <p>

If technology hampers criminal investigations, why not eliminate cars except
for police.  Then we could catch a lot more criminals.  This is a stupid
argument.  Let's get better police and better tools for them to use, and not
try to weaken the very fabric of our information society instead. <p>

&gt;     Mr. Rotenberg said "We want the public to understand the full
&gt;     implications of this plan.  Today it is only a few experts and
&gt;     industry groups that understand the proposal.
&gt;
&gt;I support this objective.  Unfortunately, it is not possible for most of us to
&gt;be fully informed of the national security implications of uncontrolled
&gt;encryption.  For very legitimate reasons, these cannot be fully discussed and
&gt;debated in a public forum.  It is even difficult to talk about the full
&gt;implications of encryption on law enforcement. <p>

This is the argument of dictators, not democracies.  If it cannot be opened
to public scrutiny, it does not belong here.  The implications of controlled
encryption are the ones you are afraid of airing.  But I am not.  Controlled
encryption is just another way for those with power to tighten their grip.
What is so frightening to you about encryption that you can't even discuss
it? Is it that people will have privacy from their own government? Is it that
we will be able to assure integrity in communications?  Giving power to the
public is not something to be feared.  It is something to be sought out and
encouraged. <p>

&gt;This is why it is important
&gt;that the President and Vice-President be fully informed on all the issues, and
&gt;for the decisions to be made at that level.  ...
&gt;In the absence of understanding the national security issues, I
&gt;believe we need to exercise some caution in believing that we can understand
&gt;the full implications of encryption on society. <p>

Why is it that you think you understand more about the implications of
cryptography on national security than the rest of us? This elitist crap has
got to end.  It is bad for our country to have elitists who believe they know
more than the rest of us dictating how we will live our lives.  It is bad for
our country that the esteemed members of this forum do not have access to your
rational in order to openly discuss your points of view.  It is bad for our
country that professors at universities tell their students and the public not
to think about the issues, but to trust that the professors know best.  If you
want to serve the national interest, get the debate out in the open! <p>

&gt; ... <p>

In one recent NRC study, the committee rightly pointed out that we need more
open research in this field.  Perhaps Professor Denning would like to follow
the recommendations of that report and open up to us. <p>

Subject: Clipper Chip Politics <p>

At first I was astounded by the hysteria over the Clipper chip but have come
to the conclusion that it is really a matter of Politics and Money - technical
worth has nothing to do with it. <p>

Have just finished reading the Cantwell Bill text on export controls and have
come to a similar conclusion. Lots of good sounding words modified by vague
exclusions. (Could not tell if PGP was permitted since all the user has to do
is install or excluded since each user must generate a unique key). <p>

Clearly, if I were to design a custom mechanism for a client and the client
had the only copies in existence, the old rules would apply &amp; if the client
were "offshore" I would be in violation. <p>

According to the EFF, Mrs. Denning and I must be the only people publicly on
the net who are in favor of Clipper/Capstone as a cheap means for very simple
limited protection. It will fill the great void that exists between that which
*should* be protected and that which *is* being protected. <p>

In the last few months, virtually every RFP I have seen deals with protection
of "Sensitive but Unclassified" information. Presently, this is done with
STU-IIIs and DES. Clunky. Ex$pen$ive. Requires effort to initiate. <p>

Government agencies faced with field offices, telecommuting, and
electronic filing desperately need something that is
1) Cheap
2) Easy to use
3) Blessed by the Government
4) Sufficient to deter hackers and reporters <p>

- not because they are personally concerned about disclosure but because
public law 93-579 (Privacy Act) and public law 100-235 (Computer Security Act)
says they *will*. And for these uses Clipper/Capstone is *good enough* (C). <p>

People bemoan the fact that the government is creating a self-indulgent
monopoly, but I have not seen anyone else rushing to fill the gap (three years
ago I outlined both in magazines and at conferences a very simple means for
access tokens/smart cards such as those from Enigma-Logic, Racal, and
Secure-ID to be used to securely encrypt remote dial-up sessions. No one was
interested. I have not seen ads for the Beaver BCC-007 encrypted laptop
computer lately either. <p>

To me the whole key escrow procedure is a legal sop, I fully expect certain
government agencies to be able to break any transmission within seconds given
the right equipment and all of the keys (not necessarily who has which, just
*all* of them), but I do not really care since anything that needs more
protection will just receive stronger encryption before C/C ever sees it. The
real value is for authentication and protection from volume analysis. (Today,
it is easy to tell which of my missives are protected and which are not. How
much and where can be valuable information even without reading the contents.
With C/C you will have to decode everything to find out which is important and
which is a take-away order). <p>

The NSA/FBI meeting at Bellcore included an assertion that a "National
Laboratory" would be required to reverse engineer the chip.  Does anyone think
that it would not be easier/cheaper to simply buy someone on the inside ?
"Security by Obscurity" may be effective for short durations and limited value
objectives but we are talking strategic value here. <p>

Thus in my opinion, the whole broohah is a smoke-screen. C/C is going to
happen, it will do what it is supposed to, it will become a standard since it
is going to be cheap and enough, and some organizations are going to make
billions of dollars off it - that is just the American Way. <p>

I still want some to play with.  Padgett <p>

From: geoff@FICUS.CS.UCLA.EDU (Geoff Kuenning)
Subject: Re: Campaign and Petition Against Clipper <p>

In RISKS-15.48, Dorothy Denning combines some good points with some very
paternalistic and unsupportable claims.  I will primarily address the latter. <p>

&gt;... The Clipper initiative is the result of
&gt;considerable deliberation by many intelligent people who appreciate and
&gt;understand the concerns that have been expressed and who worked hard to
&gt;accommodate the conflicting interests.  The decisions that have been made were
&gt;not made lightly. <p>

In other words, despite the fact that many intelligent and well-informed
people *oppose* Clipper, "we know best, so stop complaining."  The fact that
the decision was made by well-intentioned people does not make it correct. <p>

&gt;The standard (FIPS 185) is not a standard for the Internet or any other high
&gt;speed computer network.  It is for the telephone system. <p>

In the first place, many people access the Internet via various forms of
telephone lines.  If they are encrypted, it will be easier to tap them if they
use Clipper.  In the second place, the Administration has been quite up-front
about its desire to force key-escrow encryption into nearly every encryption
application.  So while Ms. Denning is technically correct in her narrow
reading of the document, CPSR is equally correct in raising an alarm about the
larger issue of high-speed networks. <p>

&gt;As near as I know, neither CPSR nor any other group has conducted any
&gt;systematic poll ... <p>

Ah, the old "silent majority" argument.  I thought that went out when Nixon
resigned. <p>

The truth is that, among the tiny fraction of the public which has expressed
an opinion, there *has* been overwhelming public opposition.  Very few people
have written the Government to say, "my, what a wonderful idea!" <p>

Organizations like TV networks have a multiplier rule they apply to letters,
where they figure that every letter received represents N people who felt the
same way, but didn't take the time to write.  To suggest that only one's
opposition took the time to write, and that everyone else is in agreement, is
at best disingenuous and at worst intellectually dishonest. <p>

&gt; The ACM is in the process of
&gt;conducting a study on encryption.  CPSR is a member of the study group, as am
&gt;I.  Steve Kent is chair.  Our goal is a report that will articulate the
&gt;issues, not a public statement either for or against. <p>

In other words, having attempted to discredit what little data we *do* have,
Ms. Denning is stating that there are no plans to conduct a scientific study
of public opinion.  Perhaps the ACM or the CPSR should fund Roper or Gallup to
investigate a few questions, approved by both Ms. Denning and a CPSR
representative as being unbiased? <p>

&gt; The International Association for Cryptologic Research has not to my
&gt; knowledge made any official statement about Clipper. <p>

I don't see what relevance this has to anything.  One organization of
cryptologists has remained silent.  So what? <p>

&gt; Hundreds of people is hardly overwhelming in a population of 250 million,
&gt; especially when most of the letters were the same and came in through the net
&gt; following a sample letter that was sent out. <p>

The first part of this statement is patently false; the same argument
could be applied to any Harris poll.  The second part, about "form
letter" distortions in public issues, is relevant and important.  All
the more reason to do a more scientific survey. <p>

&gt; ...  I do not know the facts of the 1970s
&gt; incident that is referred to here, but it sounds like it occurred before
&gt; passage of the 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.  This act requires
&gt; intelligence agencies to get a court order in order to intercept
&gt; communications of American citizens. <p>

The 1978 act was passed in response to the abuses of the early 70's.  It
should not have been necessary, since the NSA was prohibited from domestic
spying even before that, but the NSA figured that since the cables involved
were international communications, it was OK to eavesdrop on them.  This is a
rather classic case illustrating the way the NSA used the loosest possible
interpretation of restrictions, rather than actively trying to respect the
privacy of law-abiding citizens. <p>

&gt; I am not aware of any recent evidence
&gt; that the NSA is engaging in illegal intercepts of Americans. <p>

Once burned, twice cautious.  Ms. Denning, think of the egg you'll have on
your face if the NSA gets caught misbehaving a few years from now.
Personally, I don't see why I should trust any person or agency that is so
secretive. <p>

&gt; The 1987 Computer Security Act states that NIST "shall draw on the technical
&gt; advice and assistance (including work products) of the National Security
&gt; Agency." <p>

The question is of who was in control.  There is a world of difference between
drawing on "advice and assistance," and stepping out of the picture to let
someone else do the job.  I believe that the latter is what CPSR is worried
about. <p>

&gt; ... I can tell you that it
&gt; is a fact that new communications technologies, including encryption, have
&gt; hampered criminal investigations. <p>

Without data or references, how are we to believe this?  CPSR carried out, at
great difficulty, some preliminary research.  There is no indication that they
selected that data, and I hope that Ms. Denning is not suggesting this.
Again, we have an attempt to invoke the "silent majority" argument to claim
that the sampled data is invalid.  Only this time Ms. Denning doesn't even
offer anything to back up her counterclaim. <p>

In the first place, let's have some facts here.  What criminal
investigations have been hampered by new technologies?  How many? <p>

In the second place, a pervasive thread in Ms. Denning's thinking seems to be
that there is no room for a tradeoff between law enforcement and freedom.  Let
me point out that crime would drop tremendously if the police were allowed to
search anyone's home at random, without warning, and to confiscate anything
they chose.  But I don't think I'd want to live in such a society.  Similarly,
I'm perfectly willing to let a few criminal investigations be "hampered" or
even fail, if it means I can use strong encryption without fear of
eavesdropping or prosecution. <p>

&gt; The standard is voluntary -- even for the government. <p>

That's not what I remember.  I seem to recall that the original announcement
said that the standard would be applicable to all government agencies.  Is
there a citation to support the claim that it's voluntary within the
government? <p>

As to outside the government, yes, it's voluntary.  For now.  But there are
already major pressures being applied to make sure that this "voluntary"
standard is the only practical choice.  For example, Clipper will be much
easier to export than RSA, Idea, or even the venerable Enigma.  Government
dollars are being used to make sure that the Clipper chip is available and
cheap, undercutting the possibility of fair free-market competition.  And
hints have been dropped that any future encryption made available to the
public will also require a key escrow scheme. <p>

John Sculley vs. West Publishing on Free Information Access (Notes from NII Advisory Committee Part 2) <p>

Date: Thu, 10 Feb 1994 20:39:17 -0600
From: djw@eff.org (Daniel J. Weitzner) <p>

Scenes from the National Information Infrastructure Advisory Committee... <p>

The following is relatively accurate reconstruction of an exchange between
John Sculley and Vance Operman (president of West Publishing) on the
subject of free information access for schools and libraries.  Sculley and
Operman were joined by VP Gore a bit later. <p>

Sculley:  I want us to think seriously about assuring that schools and
libraries can have free access to information resources.  Not just the
transport, but the content as well.  Certainly this has a cost attached to
it, but it would be an invaluable investment in our nation's future. <p>

Operman:  John, you couldn't mean that.  If information is free than it's
worth nothing.... I would be horror-stricken if the result of this
committee was a consensus that all library resources were available for
free anywhere around the NII.  That would put an end to the US information
industry. <p>

[Some time passes, VP Gore arrives to make some brief comments, and the
raises the subject of free access to the NII for schools, libraries and
clinics.] <p>

Sculley [in response to Gore]: We don't the high price of information to be
a barrier for classroom and library access.  We have to talk about more
than just putting wires in schools and libraries. <p>

Gore: We should talk about free connect time as well for classrooms.  I
know that this has a cost, but it's so important that I'm not prepared to
talk it off the table just yet.  It would be a very important investment. <p>

Operman:  Well I'll give you an example of a way that market forces all by
themselves have provided free access, without any government involvment.
Both West and Mead provide law students free access to their legal
information services, at very high cost to the companies.  That's millions
of dollars of subsidy right there, resulting from competitive market forces
alone. <p>

Gore:  Well, Vance, professional schools are different from elementary
schools.  (Operman interrupts: "law schools aren't much different from
elementary schools)  It makes some sense to have a loss leader there to
build a market for your services amoung law school graduates. <p>

Operman: Well, certain well known computer companies [he turns to Sculley]
have been known to put a lot of computers in classrooms for similar
reasons. <p>

Gore:  I really don't think that we're talking about the same market.  One
is computers and the other is information services.  Unless you believe
that Nintendo will come up with some kind of Euclidean geometry game that
they would give a way for free.  But until you see this happening, we still
have to ensure free access for schools. <p>

Bob Johnson (CEO Black Entertainment Television): There are also some
markets, regions, that no one competes for.  These communities need
information access, too. <p>

[I'm not representing this as a word-for-word transcript, but it's a pretty
careful paraphrase of the main points made with a fair amount of direct
quotation.] <p>

X-Comment: CNI Modernization of Scholarly Publication WG <p>

---------- original ------------------
        From: Jerry Berman, Executive Director of EFF
        jberman@eff.org <p>

This is the first step in a larger campaign to counter the efforts of
        those who would restrict our ability to speak freely and with privacy.
        Please stay tuned--we'll continue to inform you of things you can do to
        promote the removal of restrictions on encryption. <p>

.......
------------ a comment from a   Charles Pearce -------------------------- <p>

I hope this larger campaign and this mini one both fail.  What you're
  talking about is experting the license for anyone (terrorists, foreign
  governments, mafia, etc.) to encrypt whatever data they choose.  This would
  essentially prevent the U. S. government from collecting intelligence on
  these groups.  A standard encryption method would let the government
  agencies concerned with these things do the jobs that Congress has mandated
  them to do and we taxpayers support.  If you're not engaged in anything
  illegal or otherwise pose a threat to national security, then don't
  worry...no one wants to read your mail.  Paranoids have always worried
  about Big Brother. <p>

Charles Pearce
  &lt;pearce@ksuvm.ksu.edu <p>

---------------- the comment to Pearce' email by Rick Crawford ------------- <p>

Those who know even a smidgen of U.S. history know that "terrorists"
such as the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. were illegally wiretapped
by our law-abiding intelligence agencies.  The communications integrity
of law-abiding U.S. citizens was even more flagrantly violated by the
FBI's COINTELPRO operations that lasted (at least) into the 1980s. <p>

Will Clipper protect us from criminals? <p>

In an unprecedented July 1993 public appearance before the Computer
System Security and Privacy Advisory Board in Washington, Dr. Clint
Brooks, the Assistant Director of the NSA, readily admitted that the
Clipper system is *not* intended to catch any criminals.  Obviously, he
said, those who have something to hide will avoid inviting government
wiretaps by using the system.  Ray Kammer, the Acting Director of NIST
(ostensibly the lead agency for Clipper), was more blunt: <p>

"It's obvious that anyone who uses Clipper for the conduct
        of organized crime is dumb." <p>

Suppose --- contrary to all historical evidence --- the public trusts
that no intelligence agency will mount an organized campaign of general
surveillance. If government-accessible cryptography is widely used, is
there a potential for rogue elements in government intelligence agencies
to abuse the public trust? The same week that Dr. Brooks testified, the
U.S. House Judiciary Committee held hearings on abuse by police of the
FBI's National Crime Information Center (NCIC --- a computerized database
of criminals and suspects).  In one instance, a former police officer
accessed the NCIC without authorization to track down and murder one of
his former girlfriends.  In another case, a woman finagled access to the
NCIC to check the records of prospective clients for her drug-dealing
boyfriend, so they could avoid undercover operatives.  It is widely
assumed that the broad collaboration between police agencies and private
security forces means that much of the NCIC data has already been
compromised, and is now duplicated in numerous private databases. <p>

Will Clipper protect us from malicious foreign governments? <p>

Anyone familiar with the encryption issue knows that you can already
buy triple-DES crypto gear on the streets of Moscow.  The genuine
terrorists had this capability long ago.  Encryption was *not*
invented in the U.S., and even our rogue intelligence agencies
have never been able to prevent foreign govts from using it. <p>

Clipper technology carries a similar risk to that of atomic power:
It must be safeguarded from misuse for generations.  Just as stockpiled
plutonium represents concentrated military power, and thus must be
guarded in perpetuity, so centralized mass-surveillance technology
offers concentrated social power, and presents a long-lived irresistible
temptation --- perhaps a "fatal attraction". <p>

Why must U.S.A. stand for "Universal Surveillance for All"? <p>

I am no stranger to national security issues, and I have no

sympathize with a statement which in essence asks the citizenry
to forsake its fundamental constitutional right to privacy on
the basis that the government knows best what is good for the
people, albeit it isn't at liberty to explain why in detail. <p>

The logic put forward on the necessity for wiretaps (duly
approved) is so fallacious as to seem ludicrous.  Drug cartels,
terrorists, malicious foreign agents and other real threats are
the last to rely on the Clipper for secure communications when
there are alternative strong encryption systems readily
available.  Who then will the NSA and others eavesdrop on?  Dumb
criminals and those with nothing to hide? <p>

How can my government, and you by association, ask me and other
citizens to abdicate our responsibility to protect our
constitutional right to privacy when no rational argument has been
presented to justify this erosion of liberty? <p>

I welcome an answer, and I respect your inability to answer all
the mail you are receiving on this matter. <p>

FBI Wiretap Cost <p>

Date: Fri, 11 Feb 1994 12:39:21 -0800
From: "Brock N. Meeks" &lt;brock@well.sf.ca.us&gt;
To: farber@central.cis.upenn.edu <p>

//CyberWire Dispatch/Copyright (c) 1994// <p>

Jacking in from the Financial Port: <p>

Washington, DC -- The White House is jumping into the lion's den. <p>

The Administration is backing a controversial FBI plan that would
mandate the installation of wiretap "trap doors" on all types of
communications, government sources said.  But the decision to
support the so-called "Digital Telephony Bill" is based, in large
part, on severely flawed data. <p>

A confidential FBI cost analysis document, a copy of which was
obtained by Dispatch, estimates it would take some $300 million to
implement the mandatory wiretap access scheme.  But government and
industry sources say that the actual cost of implementation could
quickly escalate to more than $1 billion.  Reason:  The FBI's own
cost analysis doesn't consider the price of mandatory compliance
for computer networks, cable TV operations, digital cellular
systems, or emerging personal communications systems. <p>

A key factor in the debate holding up the announcement of White
House backed digital wiretap legislation is who will eventually be
saddled with the bill.  It might help if the FBI could come up with
some reliable figures, but even their own classified documents
acknowledge that they don't have a clue:  "The cost to the
telecommunications industry of complying with the provisions and
requirements of the legislation is not susceptible the precise
measurement." <p>

Software Solutions
================== <p>

The FBI's answer to the digital wiretap problem lies in developing
a software program that could be loaded into a telephone switch.
But the cost for developing this software is "difficult to estimate
absent specific feasibility studies," FBI documents say.  It is
known that at least four different versions of the program would
have be written to cover the installed base of telephone switches
in the U.S. <p>

What the FBI's cost estimate doesn't mention is the price for
maintaining the software.  Currently the Baby Bells and major
independent telephone companies spend more than $1 billion in new
switch and application upgrade software, according to the National
Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners. Now, you tell me,
who's going to pony up the bucks to revise the wiretap software to
make sure it's compatible with each new calling feature and
modification to switch software? <p>

Quality control and the integrity of the nation's telephone network
isn't something the phone companies are willing to fuck with.
Software is a big, big deal.  Switch manufacturers remember all too
well getting reamed by House Telecommunications Subcommittee
Chairman Ed Markey (D-Mass.) during intense congressional hearings
in 1990 to explain why half of the East Coast lost dial tone when
switches toppled like dominoes.  The cause, it was later admitted,
was a "3 Bit Bug" software coding error.  The switch's software
revision hadn't undergone rigorous enough testing before being
installed in the local network. <p>

So, who picks up the check?  The FBI first wanted you to pay for
all this work.  That's right, through higher local telephone rates.
That idea drew such withering fire from consumer groups and
industry that the FBI deleted that language from its original bill.
But the question remains:  Who the hell is going to pay? <p>

The FBI says it can short hop all this grief:  "Industry may, after
comparing the necessary attributes of electronic surveillance with
available or planned network/system analysis and maintenance tools,
formulate solutions for embedded and emerging systems that would
require a much less extensive level of efforts, and a commensurate
reduction of costs." <p>

In other words, the FBI thinks switch manufacturers will simply
start making their switches "wiretap ready" as they come off the
damn assembly line.  Neat trick if you can pull it off.  Bury the
cost in the R&amp;D budget, hide it in the retail cost of the switch
and BINGO, the phone companies get to depreciate the cost over 20
years and the ratepayer (that's you) has no idea that they end up
paying to make some cop's life easier. <p>

Data Diving
=========== <p>

When it comes to eavesdropping on someone's Prodigy or CompuServe
or Internet session, the FBI again has a simple solution:  Turn the
system administrator into an ad hoc FBI agent.  You think I'm
joking?  Check out this statement, again from the confidential FBI
report: "Enhanced audit functions could be included in future
operating system revisions or through after-market
diagnostics/audit software packages.  (The Norton Network Wiretap
Utilities, no doubt.)  The implementation of this capability would
be, in essence, a no cost educational process for the system's
operator or administrator." (But will they be able to sleep at
night?) <p>

Cable TV systems get hammered, too.  With cable companies getting
into the telephone business, the FBI wants to be sure they are
required to make their networks wiretap ready.  Because "a certain
number" of wiretaps "would be expected to occur within such
systems," the FBI said.  The FBI cost documents don't even proffer
a guess at what it would cost to front load cable networks with
wiretap software.  Instead, the FBI says that if these cable
systems use the switches of the Baby Bells, well, everything is
Jake.  Why?  Because the local telephone companies would have
already installed the damn software long ago. <p>

What happens if cable companies want to build their own independent
telephone networks?  Not to worry, the FBI says, "it would be
contemplated that [cable companies] would 'engineer in' criminal
law enforcement's needs in the design stages of development."  And
once that occurs, "the costs associated with compliance would be
minimal," the FBI says. <p>

The same logic applies to emerging PCS systems.  The "most cost
efficient solution" for potential PCS companies is to design and
plan for mandatory wiretap access capability "during the
development and pre-production phase" of their networks, the FBI
said. <p>

Are you getting this?  If the FBI gets its way, the entire NEXT
GENERATION of communications networks -- from your hand held "call
anywhere phone," to your digital personal assistant, like Apple's
Newton -- will come PRE-INSTALLED with wiretap capability.  And the
cost will be buried, yet again, the design phase.  Nice touch. <p>

Oh yeah, then there are those pesky PBXs, the ones owned by
businesses, schools, churches, libraries, non-profit organizations.
According to the FCC there are up to 400,000 of these buggers
hanging around, of which 70% are analog breathing technological
beasts.  Analog technology is doable for the FBI;  it's the digital
shit they can't handle. <p>

The FBI says that to replace a PBX that gives them grief would cost
an average of $70,000, in 1992 dollars.  So, being the nice guys
they are, the FBI would allow the Justice Department to grant a
waiver to these PBX owners so they could save up enough money to
buy a wiretap equipped PBX. <p>

Digital Wiretaps, Making the Nation Safe
======================================== <p>

The FBI thinks all this is worth it, apparently at any cost.
Failing to do so would cause "enormous economic harm" due to crime,
which it estimates is in the multibillion range, the FBI says.
Still not convinced?  Well, to hell with the cost, the damn
telecommunications industry is obligated to do all this, according
to FBI logic. <p>

"It is worth noting... that the telecommunications industry
historically has been required to respond to public safety needs
both at the state and Federal levels," the FBI says. "We view the
legislative proposal as being consistent with the need to ensure
the public's safety through the effective enforcement of the law." <p>

Meeks out... <p>

Vice President Says Clipper Chip Controls Inadequate
Gore Indicates Administration's Position Is 'Not Locked in Stone' <p>

By Jayne Levin
(c) 1994 <p>

WASHINGTON, Feb. 11--Vice President Gore said controls
recently adopted by the Clinton administration that authorize
two government agencies to safeguard the electronic "keys" in an
encoding device called the "Clipper Chip" are inadequate.
    Under the Clipper plan, the keys would be stored at the
Treasury Department and the National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST), which is part of the Commerce Department.
Both Treasury and Commerce are from the same branch of
government, the executive branch.
    "When I saw that I said, 'Wow. Wow. That is not right,' and
I raised hell about that," Gore said in an interview Thursday.
    Having the key holders from the same branch of government
raises concern because there is no system of checks and
balances, Gore said. "That's going to be changed," he said.
Clipper gives law-enforcement agencies a key to eavesdrop on
telephone and computer communications under a court order.
    The selection of NIST and Treasury "was spun out of the
process at the low level and was not vetted at the top," Gore
said. Gore's comments were made after appearing before the first
meeting of a private sector advisory panel on the development of
a "national information infrastructure" in Washington, D.C.
    The administration announced Feb. 4 that it intends to push
ahead with the voluntary Clipper Chip encryption scheme, despite
vehement opposition from computer companies and watchdog groups,
such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and the
Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility.
    But Gore indicated Thursday that the administration's
position is "not locked in stone."
    "Our determination to solve the problem is locked in stone,
and our determination to proceed with this in the absence of a
better solution is locked in stone," he said "...the burden is
on those who say there is a better solution because no solution
for the national security dimension of the problem
is unacceptable to us."
    Mitch Kapor, EFF chairman and a member of the advisory
committee, said he was "encouraged" by the vice president's
remarks.
    "This was a signal to me that [the administration] is very
ready and willing to look at alternatives...both to the
administrative procedures and the technology."
    Computer manufacturers, telecommunications companies and
civil rights groups argue that Clipper would undermine
individuals' right to privacy and cripple U.S. exports of
computer products.
    "If I'm going to conduct business...engage in confidential
conversations...send money and credit card numbers over this
infrastructure, I want some guarantee that my communications are
private and that some rogue law enforcement officer can't go
and compromise my information," said Esther Dyson, president of
EDventure Holdings Inc. and a panel member. * <p>

Yes we did!  The background material stated explicitly that "the

any American to use any encryption device.  (Unfortunately, since we
cannot predict the outcome of future elections, we cannot predict what
might happen in the future.) <p>

&gt; The administration did not announce on Feb. 4th that it retained the right

That's true, but the Administration also did not retract its comment
from the April 16 Q-and-A. <p>

Let's be clear about this. The Administration said on Friday that
it was not making Clipper mandatory. But the Administration has also
said that it does not believe that citizens have the right to
unbreakable encryption "as a matter of right." Nothing said on
Friday retracted the prior comment. <p>

Remember, there's a difference between: <p>

"The Administration did not say on Friday that it might consider banning
alternative encryption technologies" <p>

and <p>

"The Administration will not consider banning alternative encryption
technologies." <p>

Your current comments leave you wiggle room on this point. You can always

My response: <p>

It seems to me that a plan which is designed to protect personal privacy
and business security should be carefully de-bugged BEFORE being offered to
the public as a viable solution. <p>

The Vice President made a number of remarks to Mitch, Esther &amp; myself which
indicated that he thought there were serious problems with the current
plan, most notably that the wrong escrow agents had been chosen.  He
suggested that some part of the judicial branch might be a more appropriate
venue. <p>

Inasmuch as the indentity of the key holder determines the degree of
privacy protection in the system as a whole, a less than ideal choice there
is a material flaw in the whole system. <p>

The Five Great Inventions of Twentieth Century Cryptography <p>

William Hugh Murray
Preface <p>

[This talk was presented as the keynote address at the 1994 RSA Security
Conference, Redwood City, CA] Foreword <p>

Two years ago I opened the first of these conferences. <p>

Jim Bidzos invited me to "kick it off;" nothing so formal as a "keynote."
While I wore this same suit, I just sort of got up here to shoot the
breeze with a few of my friends and colleagues. No notes, just sort of
"off-the-cuff." He did not even tell me how long I could talk. As far as I
know there were no reporters present; nothing that I said got me in
trouble. <p>

After the morning session was over, Jim hosted a lunch for some of the
speakers and panelists. Whit Diffie sat beside me, with his notes, and
began to quiz me on my sources and authorities for my comments. He even
told me that some of my best stories were apocryphal (though he conceded
me the points that I made with them). <p>

Well, I see the same friends, but there are far more colleagues. The
program is more formal, Diffie still has his pad and pencil, the press is
here, my remarks are styled as a "keynote," they are sufficiently arguable
that I need to choose my words very carefully, and I have a fixed time to
end. Prudence suggests that I use notes. Introduction <p>

Cryptography, the art of secret communication, is almost as old as
writing. Indeed, it has been suggested that, at least for a while, writing
itself was a relative secret. Certainly it was esoteric and its use was
reserved to an initiated elite. <p>

Cryptography and recording and communicating technologies have played leap
frog through the pages of history. It is my thesis that both have changed
so radically during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries as to
constitute a new era. <p>

On the recording and communicating side we have photography, telegraphy,
telephony, radio, phonography, cinema, television, and
telecommunications.hy, telephony, radio, cinema, television, and the
computer. Collectively, and even individually, these technologies
constitute a dramatic change in our ability to make a mark across time and
space. <p>

We have seen a similar advance in our ability to conceal those records and
messages from all but a chosen few. <p>

Modern cryptography has its origins between the two great wars of the
twentieth century. .It was driven as much by the use of radio on the
battlefield as by any other single influence, but there are an infinite
number of important recording and communicating applications that simply
cannot be done in clear text. <p>

While more sparingly used and less well known, the advances in
cryptography have been no less dramatic than those in recording and
communications. <p>

I propose to consider five inventions of the twentieth century that have
defined modern cryptography and that set it apart from ancient or
traditional cryptography. <p>

The impact of these technologies has been to simplify the use of codes,
reduce their cost, and increase by orders of magnitude the cost to a
cryptanalyst of recovering information protected by the codes. <p>

What constitutes an invention or sets it apart from other inventions is
somewhat arbitrary. Some of the inventions that I propose to discuss could
be considered as a group of other inventions; the members of the group
might or might not be significant by themselves. <p>

I have limited myself to a discussion of inventions rather than
accomplishments, and to cryptography rather than to cryptanalysis. <p>

Many of the accomplishments of the century have been in cryptanalysis and
may have been greater than the inventions in cryptography. However,
greatness is in the eye of the beholder. Certainly all the inventions have
not been limited to cryptography. <p>

For example, if cryptanalysts did not invent the modern computer, they
certainly gave it a major boost. They have lived to see the advantage that
it provides shift, with its scale, from them to the cryptographer.
Automated Encoding and Decoding <p>

Modern cryptography begins in 1917 with the invention by Gilbert S.
Vernam, an employee of the American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company, of the
Vernam System. <p>

Vernam used two paper tape readers, one for the message and the other for
the key. He added the two (bit-wise and modulo 2) to produce the
ciphertext. <p>

Moreover, he used the standard information technology of his day to
automate the encoding and decoding of information. <p>

Modern cryptography is automatic. Translation from plaintext to ciphertext
and back again is performed automatically, that is by a machine or
automaton. <p>

While there may be a separate step, the conversion from one code to the
other is done by a machine rather than by a person. <p>

Today that conversion can be done by almost any single user computer. With
appropriate controls and for some applications it can be done in a
multi-user computer. <p>

Before computers, this encoding was done in special purpose machines. The
Enigma and Purple machines were both early and famous examples of such
machines. <p>

The requirement to manually convert from natural language to secret codes
has always been a limitation. It tended to limit both the amount of
traffic encrypted and the complexity of the encoding schemes used. <p>

Therefore, encryption machines of any kind increase the complexity and
effectiveness of the codes available. <p>

At one level, the modern computer can be viewed as a general purpose code
conversion machine. That is, it converts information called input into a
new representation called output. <p>

The relationship between the input and the output can be simple or
complex, obvious or obscure, public or secret, and reversible or
irreversible. <p>

If the conversion is complex, obscure, secret, and reversible, then the
computer can be viewed as an encryption machine. <p>

But for want of a small amount of readily available software, all of the
hundred million general purpose computers in the world are encryption
engines of immense power. <p>

At some price in performance, the relationship between input and output
can be arbitrarily complex and obscure and thus arbitrarily effective in
concealing the meaning of the output. <p>

The cost of computer performance has been falling steadily and rapidly for
fifty years. It has now become so cheap that most capacity is not used for
the convenience of having it ready when it is wanted. The result is that
the use of secret codes can be viewed as almost free. <p>

So cheap is automatic coding and encoding that some applications do it by
default and globally, concealing it completely from the user. Since the
difference in cost between public codes and secret codes is vanishing and
can be paid in a currency, computer cycles, that might otherwise be
wasted, secret codes can be used by default. Independent Long Key Variable <p>

The major weakness of Vernam's system was that it required so much key
material. This was compensated for by Lyman Morehouse who used two key
tapes of 1000 and 999 characters, about eight feet each in length, in
combination to produce an effective key tape of 999,000 characters,
effectively 8000 feet in length. Morehouse had used a long key. <p>

Modern cryptography is tailored to a particular use by a key variable, or
simply a key. The key is a large integer that tailors the behavior of the
standard algorithm and makes it generate a cipher that is specific to that
number. <p>

The requirement for secrecy is limited to this number. The problem of
protecting the data reduces to the simpler one of protecting the key. <p>

Access to the cleartext requires access to the combination of the
ciphertext, the base mechanism, usually a computer and a program, and the
key. <p>

Since the rest are readily available, the efficiency of any use depends
upon the fact that it is more expensive or difficult to obtain the key
than to obtain the protected data by other means. <p>

All other things being equal, the longer the key, the more secure the
mechanism. Key length is a trade off against the complexity and the
secrecy of the algorithm. <p>

The longer the key, the simpler and more obvious can be the mechanism or
algorithm. <p>

If the key is as long as the message, statistically random in appearance,
and used only once (one-time pad), then such a simple and obvious
mechanism as modulo addition will still provide effective security. <p>

For practical reasons, short keys and more complex mechanisms are
preferred.
Complexity Based Cryptography (The Data Encryption Standard) <p>

In May 1973 the US National Bureau of Standards advertised in the Federal
Register for a proposal for an encryption mechanism to be employed as a
standard mechanism for all of the needs of the civilian sectors of the
government. <p>

The ad stated that the successful proposal would be for a mechanism that
would be secure for at least five years in spite of the fact that the
mechanism would be public and published. <p>

The resulting Data Encryption Standard was proposed by the IBM
Corporation. It was invented by a team led by Walter Tuchman and was based
upon a concept originated by Horst Feistel of IBM's Yorktown Research
Laboratory. <p>

This mechanism, which can be implemented on a chip and completely
described in a few 8.5"X11'' pages, changed the nature of cryptography
forever. <p>

The security of modern encryption mechanisms like the DES is rooted in
their complexity rather than in their secrecy. <p>

While traditional encryption relied upon the secrecy of the mechanism to
conceal the meaning of the message, these modern mechanisms employ
standard and public algorithms. <p>

These mechanisms are standard in the sense that they are of known strength
or have a known cost of attack. However, the trade-off is that their
effectiveness can not, must not, depend upon their secrecy. <p>

Rather, it relies upon the complexity of the mechanism. The complexity of
modern ciphers is such that they can be effective even though most of
their mechanism is public. <p>

The most well known, trusted, and widely used of all modern ciphers is the
Data Encryption Standard. Because of the intended breadth and duration of
the use of this cipher, the sponsors specified that it should be assumed
to be public. <p>

Its effectiveness should rely upon the secrecy only of the key (see the
next section). It has been public for more than fifteen years, but its
effectiveness is such that trying all possible keys with known plain and
cipher text is still the cheapest practical attack. <p>

[The DES belongs to a class of ciphers known as Feistel ciphers. These
ciphers are also known as block product ciphers. They are called block
ciphers because they operate on a fixed length block of bits or
characters. They are called product ciphers because they employ both
substitution and transposition.] <p>

Automatic Key Management <p>

The same key must exist at both ends of the communication. Historically,
keys were distributed by a separate channel or path than the one by which
the encrypted traffic passed. <p>

The initial distribution and installation of the keys must be done in such
a way as not to disclose them to the adversary. <p>

When this is done manually, it represents a significant opportunity for
the compromise of the system. <p>

Because they were attempting to combine cryptography and computing in a
novel manner, Tuchman and his team understood this problem very well. <p>

The products that they based upon the DES algorithm addressed it, in part,
by automating the generation, distribution, installation, storage,
control, and timely changing of the keys. <p>

Their elegant system is described in two papers published in the IBM
Systems Journal Vol. 17(2) pp. 106-125 (1978) and covered by a number of
fundamental patents based upon it. [While NSA had automated some key
management operations, and while Rosenblum was awarded a patent for a "key
distribution center," these were ad hoc. This work is the first that
describes and implements a complete and integrated automatic system.] <p>

The impact of this concept on the effectiveness, efficiency, and ease of
application of modern cryptography is immense. However, it may also the
the least understood and appreciated. <p>

For example, much of the analysis of the strength of the DES is made in
the context of the primitive DES. However, the DES rarely appears as a
primitive. Instead it appears in implementations which use it in such a
way as to compensate for its inherent limitations. <p>

For example, automatic generation of the keys avoids the use of weak or
trivial keys. (the DES has four known weak keys and four semiweak keys.) <p>

Since automatic key management systems permit so many keys,
they also reduce the exposure to "known plaintext" attacks. <p>

History suggests that codes are most often broken because the user fails
to apply them with the necessary rigor and discipline, particularly when
choosing, distributing, and installing keys. <p>

Automating of these steps provides much of the necessary discipline and
rigor. <p>

Automatic key distribution and installation increases the effectiveness by
protecting the keys from disclosure during distribution, and by making the
system resistant to the insertion of keys known to attackers. <p>

When keys are installed manually they become known to the human agent who
installs them. He is in a position to provide a copy of the key to others.
To the extent that this agent is vulnerable to coercion or bribery, the
system is weakened by this knowledge. <p>

Therefore, the system may be strengthened by automatic mechanisms which
provide the agent with beneficial use of the key without granting him
knowledge of it. <p>

For example, systems available from IBM and Motorola provide for the key
to be distributed in smartcards and automatically installed in the target
machine. <p>

The key can be encrypted in the smartcard or destroyed by the installation
process. In either case, the agent can use it, but cannot copy it or give
it to another. <p>

Just as the use of automata for encoding and decoding reduces the cost and
inconvenience of using secret codes, the use of automata for key
management reduces the cost and inconvenience of changing the keys
frequently. <p>

By changing the key frequently, e.g., for each, file, session, message, or
transaction, the value to an adversary of obtaining a key is reduced, and
the effectiveness of the mechanism is improved. <p>

One way of looking at automated key management is that it increases the
effective length of the key, or makes it approach the length of the data
protected. Asymmetric Key Cryptography <p>

However, even though most of the key management can be automated, most
such systems require some prearrangement. In any-to-any communications in
a large open population, this requirement can quickly become overwhelming. <p>

For example, in a population of two hundred people, the number of key
pairs and secret exchanges would be in the thousands with many
opportunities for keys to be compromised. Moreover, with traditional keys,
the initial distribution of keys must be done in such a way as to maintain
their secrecy, practically impossible in a large population. <p>

These problems are addressed, in part, by public key, or asymmetric key,
cryptography. This mechanism was proposed by Whitfield Diffee, Martin
Hellman, and Ralph Merkle. It may be the single most innovative idea in
modern cryptography. <p>

The best known and most widely used implementation is the RSA algorithm
invented by Ronald Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adelman. <p>

[In this mechanism the key has two parts, only one of which must be kept
secret. The two parts have the special property that what is encrypted
with one can only be decrypted with the other. <p>

One half of the key-pair, called the private key, is kept secret and is
used only by its owner. <p>

The other half, called the public key, is published and is used by all
parties that want to communicate with the private key owner. <p>

It can be published and does not need to be distributed secretly. <p>

Since the public key, by definition, is available to anyone, then anyone
can send a message to the owner that only he can read.] <p>

With a minimum of pre-arrangement, this function provides the logical
analog of an envelope that can only be opened by one person. The larger
the communicating population, and the more hostile the environment, the
greater is its advantage over symmetric key cryptography. <p>

This concealment from all but the intended recipient is the traditional
use of cryptography. However, asymmetric key cryptography has another use. <p>

A message encrypted using the private key can be read by anyone with
access to the public key, but it could only have been encrypted by the
owner of the corresponding private key. This use is analogous to a digital
signature. <p>

It provides confidence that the message originates where it appears to
have originated. Since if even a bit of the message is changed it will not
decrypt properly, this mechanism also provides confidence that the message
has not been either maliciously or accidentally altered. <p>

In part, this is also true as between the two parties to a message that is
sent using symmetric key cryptography. That is, the recipient of the
message knows with a high degree of confidence that it originated with the
other holder of the key; he knows it, but he cannot prove it to another. <p>

However, with asymmetric key cryptography, he can demonstrate it to a
third party. If the owner of the key pair has acknowledged the public part
of the key to the third party, then he cannot plausibly deny any message
that can be decrypted with it. <p>

[The concept of the digital signature is such a novel concept as to easily
qualify as an invention on its own. However, it is so closely bound in
origin and literature to asymmetric key cryptography that I elect to
simply treat them as one.] <p>

These two abstractions, the logical envelope and the logical signature,
can be composed so as to synthesize any and all of the controls that we
have ever been able to achieve by more traditional means. <p>

They can be used for payments, contracts, testaments, and high integrity
journals and logs. <p>

They provide us with a higher degree of security in an electronic
environment than we were ever able to achieve in a paper environment. <p>

They provide protection in an open environment that is nearly as high as
that which we can achieve in an open one. The Impact of the Great
Inventions <p>

The impact of these inventions is to provide us with secret codes that are
cheap enough to be used by default, and arbitrarily strong. <p>

Given assumptions about the quantity of data to be protected, the length
of time that it must remain secret, its value to an adversary, and the
resources available to the adversary, it is possible to apply modern
cryptography in such a way as to be as strong as required. <p>

While it is possible to state a problem in such a way as to defy such a
solution, it is difficult to identify such a problem in the real world. <p>

That is, It is possible to specify so much data to be encrypted under a
single key, of such high value and which must remain safe for such a long
time that we cannot say with confidence that the mechanism can stand for
that time and cost. <p>

For example, we cannot say with confidence how to encrypt several hundred
gigabytes worth several trillion dollars and keep it safe for a
millennium. On the other hand, we are not aware of any real problems that
meet such a specification. <p>

Put another way, we can always ensure that the cost of obtaining the
information by cryptanalysis is higher than the value of the data or the
cost of obtaining it by alternative means. <p>

While any code can be broken at some cost, modern codes are economically
unbreakable, at least in the sense that the cost of doing so can be made
to exceed the value of doing it. <p>

A very small increase in the cost to the cryptographer can result in
astronomical increases in the cost to a potential adversary. <p>

Perhaps just as important, these mechanisms are now sufficiently
convenient to use, that, within bounds, they can be widely and easily
applied. <p>

Given that the more data that is encrypted with a single mechanism, the
greater the value in breaking it, the more compromising information is
available to an adversary, and that the more a mechanism is used the
greater the opportunity for a compromising error in its use, we should
continue to apply cryptography only to data that can profit from its use. <p>

On the other we need never again be inhibited from using it by issues of
cost or convenience.
Cryptography and Government Policy <p>

It should be obvious to a qualified observer that, announcements here to
the contrary not withstanding, we are losing the battle for security and
privacy in the computerized and networked world. <p>

We could have secret codes imbedded in all software of interest for free.
This assertion assumes only that all such software is produced by those
represented here, who have already paid for licenses and absorbed much of
the necessary development cost, and that the cost of a marginal cycle on
the desktop approaches zero. <p>

That we do not, is the result of ambivalent government policy. While one
agency of government has sponsored the use of standard cryptography,
another has tried to undermine confidence in those standards. <p>

While one agency has asserted that public standards are essential, another
has sponsored secret ones, and a third has used public funds to further
such secret standards. <p>

While one agency has insisted that trusted codes are essential to world
prosperity, another has imposed restrictions on their export and
undermined confidence in those that are exported. <p>

While one agency recognizes that national security depends upon world
prosperity, another believes that signals intelligence is more important.
Those of you who have seen my comments in Risks, sci.crypt , and the
Communications of the ACM, know my position. <p>

It is that the prime mover behind all of these initiatives is NSA, that
their motive is the preservation of their jobs and power by protecting the
efficiency of signals intelligence, that their strategy is to discourage
by every means that they can get away with all private and most commercial
use of cryptography. That they have infiltrated the departments of State
and Commerce and the White House staff, and that they are using the
Department of Justice. <p>

While they know that they cannot be fully successful, they also know that
they do not have to be. <p>

Nor is this simply paranoia on my part. It is the only explanation that
accounts for all of the government's actions. It also meets the tests
proposed by Machiavelli, Willie Sutton and "Deep Throat." <p>

While most of the government confesses that cryptography is essential to
personal privacy in the modern era, the administration is not prepared to
admit that even the current sparse use is consistent with the government's
responsibility to preserve public order. <p>

Let me stress that the problem is government policy, not public policy and
not administration or congressional policy. This policy has been made in
secret and has been resistant to public input. <p>

It is the policy of the bureaucracy and not of any individuals. I know
most of the players in the development of this policy. I know none that
are pursuing a personal agenda, like the results, or are proud of their
roles in it. <p>

They are simply doing the best that they know how in the face of agency
momentum, administration consent, and the absence of congressional
guidance. However, the momentum behind these policies is such that the
good intentions and professionalism of the individuals is not sufficient
to resist it. <p>

While the administration has aligned itself with the initiatives, it is
not their author. While the initiatives have sponsors within the
administration, they were here before the administration and they expect
to be here when it is gone. <p>

They believe that the policy is important and that the administration is
not. <p>

While some committees of the congress have held hearings on the issues and
even decried the arbitrary actions of the bureaucracy, their hearings
always conclude with executive sessions with the NSA and no legislative
initiatives to curb the excesses. <p>

Forgive me a closing political observation not intended to be partisan.
This government is too large, over-zealous and under-effective. It is
committed to nothing so much as its own survival. <p>

It may be too late to influence it, but if it is not influenced, not only
will we not enjoy the fruits of modern cryptography, but we may not enjoy
those of telecommunications, trade, our labors, or even those of freedom.

complex, obvious or obscure, public or secret, and reversible or
irreversible. <p>

If the conversion is complex, obscure, secret, and reversible, then the
computer can be viewed as an encryption machine. <p>

But for want of a small amount of readily available software, all of the
hundred million general purpose computers in the world are encryption
engines of immense power. <p>

At some price in performance, the relationship between input and output
can be arbitrarily complex and obscure and thus arbitrarily effective in
concealing the meaning of the output. <p>

The cost of computer performance has been falling steadily and rapidly for
fifty years. It has now become so cheap that most capacity is not used for
the convenience of having it ready when it is wanted. The result is that
the use of secret codes can be viewed as almost free. <p>

So cheap is automatic coding and encoding that some applications do it by
default and globally, concealing it completely from the user. Since the
difference in cost between public codes and secret codes is vanishing and
can be paid in a currency, computer cycles, that might otherwise be
wasted, secret codes can be used by default. <p>

Independent Long Key Variable <p>

The major weakness of Vernam's system was that it required so much key
material. This was compensated for by Lyman Morehouse who used two key
tapes of 1000 and 999 characters, about eight feet each in length, in
combination to produce an effective key tape of 999,000 characters,
effectively 8000 feet in length. Morehouse had used a long key. <p>

Modern cryptography is tailored to a particular use by a key variable, or
simply a key. The key is a large integer that tailors the behavior of the
standard algorithm and makes it generate a cipher that is specific to that
number. <p>

The requirement for secrecy is limited to this number. The problem of
protecting the data reduces to the simpler one of protecting the key. <p>

Access to the cleartext requires access to the combination of the
ciphertext, the base mechanism, usually a computer and a program, and the
key. <p>

Since the rest are readily available, the efficiency of any use depends
upon the fact that it is more expensive or difficult to obtain the key
than to obtain the protected data by other means. <p>

All other things being equal, the longer the key, the more secure the
mechanism. Key length is a trade off against the complexity and the
secrecy of the algorithm. <p>

The longer the key, the simpler and more obvious can be the mechanism or
algorithm. <p>

If the key is as long as the message, statistically random in appearance,
and used only once (one-time pad), then such a simple and obvious
mechanism as modulo addition will still provide effective security. <p>

For practical reasons, short keys and more complex mechanisms are
preferred. <p>

Complexity Based Cryptography (The Data Encryption Standard) <p>

In May 1973 the US National Bureau of Standards advertised in the Federal
Register for a proposal for an encryption mechanism to be employed as a
standard mechanism for all of the needs of the civilian sectors of the
government. <p>

The ad stated that the successful proposal would be for a mechanism that
would be secure for at least five years in spite of the fact that the
mechanism would be public and published. <p>

The resulting Data Encryption Standard was proposed by the IBM
Corporation. It was invented by a team led by Walter Tuchman and was based
upon a concept originated by Horst Feistel of IBM's Yorktown Research
Laboratory. <p>

This mechanism, which can be implemented on a chip and completely
described in a few 8.5"X11'' pages, changed the nature of cryptography
forever. <p>

The security of modern encryption mechanisms like the DES is rooted in
their complexity rather than in their secrecy. <p>

While traditional encryption relied upon the secrecy of the mechanism to
conceal the meaning of the message, these modern mechanisms employ
standard and public algorithms. <p>

These mechanisms are standard in the sense that they are of known strength
or have a known cost of attack. However, the trade-off is that their
effectiveness can not, must not, depend upon their secrecy. <p>

Rather, it relies upon the complexity of the mechanism. The complexity of
modern ciphers is such that they can be effective even though most of
their mechanism is public. <p>

The most well known, trusted, and widely used of all modern ciphers is the
Data Encryption Standard. Because of the intended breadth and duration of
the use of this cipher, the sponsors specified that it should be assumed
to be public. <p>

Its effectiveness should rely upon the secrecy only of the key (see the
next section). It has been public for more than fifteen years, but its
effectiveness is such that trying all possible keys with known plain and
cipher text is still the cheapest practical attack. <p>

[The DES belongs to a class of ciphers known as Feistel ciphers. These
ciphers are also known as block product ciphers. They are called block
ciphers because they operate on a fixed length block of bits or
characters. They are called product ciphers because they employ both
substitution and transposition.] <p>

Automatic Key Management <p>

The same key must exist at both ends of the communication. Historically,
keys were distributed by a separate channel or path than the one by which
the encrypted traffic passed. <p>

The initial distribution and installation of the keys must be done in such
a way as not to disclose them to the adversary. <p>

When this is done manually, it represents a significant opportunity for
the compromise of the system. <p>

Because they were attempting to combine cryptography and computing in a
novel manner, Tuchman and his team understood this problem very well. <p>

The products that they based upon the DES algorithm addressed it, in part,
by automating the generation, distribution, installation, storage,
control, and timely changing of the keys. <p>

Their elegant system is described in two papers published in the IBM
Systems Journal Vol. 17(2) pp. 106-125 (1978) and covered by a number of
fundamental patents based upon it. [While NSA had automated some key
management operations, and while Rosenblum was awarded a patent for a "key
distribution center," these were ad hoc. This work is the first that
describes and implements a complete and integrated automatic system.] <p>

The impact of this concept on the effectiveness, efficiency, and ease of
application of modern cryptography is immense. However, it may also the
the least understood and appreciated. <p>

For example, much of the analysis of the strength of the DES is made in
the context of the primitive DES. However, the DES rarely appears as a
primitive. Instead it appears in implementations which use it in such a
way as to compensate for its inherent limitations. <p>

For example, automatic generation of the keys avoids the use of weak or
trivial keys. (the DES has four known weak keys and four semiweak keys.) <p>

Since automatic key management systems permit so many keys,
they also reduce the exposure to "known plaintext" attacks. <p>

History suggests that codes are most often broken because the user fails
to apply them with the necessary rigor and discipline, particularly when
choosing, distributing, and installing keys. <p>

Automating of these steps provides much of the necessary discipline and
rigor. <p>

Automatic key distribution and installation increases the effectiveness by
protecting the keys from disclosure during distribution, and by making the
system resistant to the insertion of keys known to attackers. <p>

When keys are installed manually they become known to the human agent who
installs them. He is in a position to provide a copy of the key to others.
To the extent that this agent is vulnerable to coercion or bribery, the
system is weakened by this knowledge. <p>

Therefore, the system may be strengthened by automatic mechanisms which
provide the agent with beneficial use of the key without granting him
knowledge of it. <p>

For example, systems available from IBM and Motorola provide for the key
to be distributed in smartcards and automatically installed in the target
machine. <p>

The key can be encrypted in the smartcard or destroyed by the installation
process. In either case, the agent can use it, but cannot copy it or give
it to another. <p>

Just as the use of automata for encoding and decoding reduces the cost and
inconvenience of using secret codes, the use of automata for key
management reduces the cost and inconvenience of changing the keys
frequently. <p>

By changing the key frequently, e.g., for each, file, session, message, or
transaction, the value to an adversary of obtaining a key is reduced, and
the effectiveness of the mechanism is improved. <p>

One way of looking at automated key management is that it increases the
effective length of the key, or makes it approach the length of the data
protected. <p>

Asymmetric Key Cryptography <p>

However, even though most of the key management can be automated, most
such systems require some prearrangement. In any-to-any communications in
a large open population, this requirement can quickly become overwhelming. <p>

For example, in a population of two hundred people, the number of key
pairs and secret exchanges would be in the thousands with many
opportunities for keys to be compromised. Moreover, with traditional keys,
the initial distribution of keys must be done in such a way as to maintain
their secrecy, practically impossible in a large population. <p>

These problems are addressed, in part, by public key, or asymmetric key,
cryptography. This mechanism was proposed by Whitfield Diffee, Martin
Hellman, and Ralph Merkle. It may be the single most innovative idea in
modern cryptography. <p>

The best known and most widely used implementation is the RSA algorithm
invented by Ronald Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adelman. <p>

[In this mechanism the key has two parts, only one of which must be kept
secret. The two parts have the special property that what is encrypted
with one can only be decrypted with the other. <p>

One half of the key-pair, called the private key, is kept secret and is
used only by its owner. <p>

The other half, called the public key, is published and is used by all
parties that want to communicate with the private key owner. <p>

It can be published and does not need to be distributed secretly. <p>

Since the public key, by definition, is available to anyone, then anyone
can send a message to the owner that only he can read.] <p>

With a minimum of pre-arrangement, this function provides the logical
analog of an envelope that can only be opened by one person. The larger
the communicating population, and the more hostile the environment, the
greater is its advantage over symmetric key cryptography. <p>

This concealment from all but the intended recipient is the traditional
use of cryptography. However, asymmetric key cryptography has another use. <p>

A message encrypted using the private key can be read by anyone with
access to the public key, but it could only have been encrypted by the
owner of the corresponding private key. This use is analogous to a digital
signature. <p>

It provides confidence that the message originates where it appears to
have originated. Since if even a bit of the message is changed it will not
decrypt properly, this mechanism also provides confidence that the message
has not been either maliciously or accidentally altered. <p>

In part, this is also true as between the two parties to a message that is
sent using symmetric key cryptography. That is, the recipient of the
message knows with a high degree of confidence that it originated with the
other holder of the key; he knows it, but he cannot prove it to another. <p>

However, with asymmetric key cryptography, he can demonstrate it to a
third party. If the owner of the key pair has acknowledged the public part
of the key to the third party, then he cannot plausibly deny any message
that can be decrypted with it. <p>

[The concept of the digital signature is such a novel concept as to easily
qualify as an invention on its own. However, it is so closely bound in
origin and literature to asymmetric key cryptography that I elect to
simply treat them as one.] <p>

These two abstractions, the logical envelope and the logical signature,
can be composed so as to synthesize any and all of the controls that we
have ever been able to achieve by more traditional means. <p>

They can be used for payments, contracts, testaments, and high integrity
journals and logs. <p>

They provide us with a higher degree of security in an electronic
environment than we were ever able to achieve in a paper environment. <p>

They provide protection in an open environment that is nearly as high as
that which we can achieve in an open one. The Impact of the Great
Inventions <p>

The impact of these inventions is to provide us with secret codes that are
cheap enough to be used by default, and arbitrarily strong. <p>

Given assumptions about the quantity of data to be protected, the length
of time that it must remain secret, its value to an adversary, and the
resources available to the adversary, it is possible to apply modern
cryptography in such a way as to be as strong as required. <p>

While it is possible to state a problem in such a way as to defy such a
solution, it is difficult to identify such a problem in the real world. <p>

That is, It is possible to specify so much data to be encrypted under a
single key, of such high value and which must remain safe for such a long
time that we cannot say with confidence that the mechanism can stand for
that time and cost. <p>

For example, we cannot say with confidence how to encrypt several hundred
gigabytes worth several trillion dollars and keep it safe for a
millennium. On the other hand, we are not aware of any real problems that
meet such a specification. <p>

Put another way, we can always ensure that the cost of obtaining the
information by cryptanalysis is higher than the value of the data or the
cost of obtaining it by alternative means. <p>

While any code can be broken at some cost, modern codes are economically
unbreakable, at least in the sense that the cost of doing so can be made
to exceed the value of doing it. <p>

A very small increase in the cost to the cryptographer can result in
astronomical increases in the cost to a potential adversary. <p>

Perhaps just as important, these mechanisms are now sufficiently
convenient to use, that, within bounds, they can be widely and easily
applied. <p>

Given that the more data that is encrypted with a single mechanism, the
greater the value in breaking it, the more compromising information is
available to an adversary, and that the more a mechanism is used the
greater the opportunity for a compromising error in its use, we should
continue to apply cryptography only to data that can profit from its use. <p>

On the other we need never again be inhibited from using it by issues of
cost or convenience. <p>

Cryptography and Government Policy <p>

It should be obvious to a qualified observer that, announcements here to
the contrary not withstanding, we are losing the battle for security and
privacy in the computerized and networked world. <p>

We could have secret codes imbedded in all software of interest for free.
This assertion assumes only that all such software is produced by those
represented here, who have already paid for licenses and absorbed much of
the necessary development cost, and that the cost of a marginal cycle on
the desktop approaches zero. <p>

That we do not, is the result of ambivalent government policy. While one
agency of government has sponsored the use of standard cryptography,
another has tried to undermine confidence in those standards. <p>

While one agency has asserted that public standards are essential, another
has sponsored secret ones, and a third has used public funds to further
such secret standards. <p>

While one agency has insisted that trusted codes are essential to world
prosperity, another has imposed restrictions on their export and
undermined confidence in those that are exported. <p>

While one agency recognizes that national security depends upon world
prosperity, another believes that signals intelligence is more important.
Those of you who have seen my comments in Risks, sci.crypt , and the
Communications of the ACM, know my position. <p>

It is that the prime mover behind all of these initiatives is NSA, that
their motive is the preservation of their jobs and power by protecting the
efficiency of signals intelligence, that their strategy is to discourage
by every means that they can get away with all private and most commercial
use of cryptography. That they have infiltrated the departments of State
and Commerce and the White House staff, and that they are using the
Department of Justice. <p>

While they know that they cannot be fully successful, they also know that
they do not have to be. <p>

Nor is this simply paranoia on my part. It is the only explanation that
accounts for all of the government's actions. It also meets the tests
proposed by Machiavelli, Willie Sutton and "Deep Throat." <p>

While most of the government confesses that cryptography is essential to
personal privacy in the modern era, the administration is not prepared to
admit that even the current sparse use is consistent with the government's
responsibility to preserve public order. <p>

Let me stress that the problem is government policy, not public policy and
not administration or congressional policy. This policy has been made in
secret and has been resistant to public input. <p>

It is the policy of the bureaucracy and not of any individuals. I know
most of the players in the development of this policy. I know none that
are pursuing a personal agenda, like the results, or are proud of their
roles in it. <p>

They are simply doing the best that they know how in the face of agency
momentum, administration consent, and the absence of congressional
guidance. However, the momentum behind these policies is such that the
good intentions and professionalism of the individuals is not sufficient
to resist it. <p>

While the administration has aligned itself with the initiatives, it is
not their author. While the initiatives have sponsors within the
administration, they were here before the administration and they expect
to be here when it is gone. <p>

They believe that the policy is important and that the administration is
not. <p>

While some committees of the congress have held hearings on the issues and
even decried the arbitrary actions of the bureaucracy, their hearings
always conclude with executive sessions with the NSA and no legislative
initiatives to curb the excesses. <p>

Forgive me a closing political observation not intended to be partisan.
This government is too large, over-zealous and under-effective. It is
committed to nothing so much as its own survival. <p>

It may be too late to influence it, but if it is not influenced, not only
will we not enjoy the fruits of modern cryptography, but we may not enjoy
those of telecommunications, trade, our labors, or even those of freedom. <p>

UK Press coverage of Clipper <p>

How America plans to bug the electronic age
Big Brother joins scramble for data <p>

By Leonard Doyle <p>

'Whether we like it or not, authorities will want to listen in on our
communications' <p>

A HIGH-RANKING official of the National Security Agency, America's largest
and most secretive intelligence arm, is in London with the task of selling
the 16 governments of the European Union and European Free Trade
Association on the virtues of a controversial electronic scrambling
technology. <p>

The Clinton administration hopes that the encryption devices will become
the global standard for anyone wanting privacy while using cellular phones,
computer networks and fax transmissions. They have a serious drawback for
anyone looking for total privacy, however. The devices have a built-in
"back door" that will allow spy agencies to listen in on all
communications, or read faxes and electronic mail. <p>

Spy agencies in the US and Europe, with nearly 50 years' experience of
advanced technology in surveillance of citizens, suspected criminals and
foreign governments, have been concerned for some time about developments
that have put sophisticated encryption devices within reach of many. <p>

The agencies want to ensure that they are not left behind by the rapid
advances in high technology which have made telephone scramblers and the
mathematical codes used to encrypt computer and fax data relatively cheap
and easy to use. <p>

The governments fear that electronic eavesdropping will be set back decades
if and when terrorists, money-launderers, drug traffickers and unfriendly
governments gain widespread access to the technology. The NSA is concerned
that, despite the $30bn (=A321bn) a year it spends monitoring global
communications, it cannot keep pace with technological change and the
massive spread of encryption codes. <p>

The NSA official, James Hearn, who until recently was the deputy director
for information security at NSA's sprawling headquarters near Washington
DC, is heading up a "liaison office" in London with a colleague, Clint
Brooks, according to reliable sources in the computer security community on
both sides of the Atlantic. The US Embassy in London issued a pro forma
denial about Mr Hearn's presence yesterday, saying: "There's nobody by that
name here." <p>

Mr Hearn is well known, however, to UK and European officials at the
cutting edge of efforts to control the spread of highly sophisticated
scrambling devices. These encryption codes, developed by private software
companies, are putting communication beyond easy reach of the NSA,
Britain's GCHQ at Cheltenham and France's DGSE, to name but a few "Big Ear"
agencies. <p>

As a response, the US has developed an encoding device for telephones and
computers known as the "Clipper Chip", with a "back door" that will allow
spy agencies armed with special electronic keys to eavesdrop. When the
Clinton administration decided to press ahead with the controversial coding
devices last week, the computer industry and privacy campaigners reacted
with outrage. <p>

"It's like trying to order people to use only resealable envelopes for
correspondence, so that no communication can ever be private again," said
David Bannisar of Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility. <p>

Big computer companies including IBM and Apple, are bitterly opposed to the
new monitoring devices. But AT&amp;T the US telephone company, which is fast
establishing itself in Europe, will put the eavesdropping technology into
the telephone scrambling devices it sells in high street shops for about
=A3800 each. <p>

The US is keen to ensure that similar electronic monitoring technology
becomes standard in the rest of the industrialised world. The NSA's Mr
Hearn has the task of persuading governments that the controversial Clipper
Chip for telephones and a technology called Tessera, for computer modems,
is quickly adopted despite mounting opposition. <p>

The US, European Commission and four European Union countries - Britain,
Germany, France and the Netherlands - are already deciding how to
administer the dawning electronic age of "information highways" which will
bring an explosion in the use of hi-tech in everyday lives. <p>

A consultant to the European Commission who has worked on the new
encryption standards claims that those who object to US efforts to regulate
the market for encryption are "politically naive".
"Whether we like it or not, the authorities will want to listen in on our
communications," he said. "The Americans are to be admired for being up
front about it, when other countries are doing the same thing anyway." <p>

Experts in the field of information security often speak of physical
boundaries that now define the world being replaced by electronic
boundaries. In this Orwellian world, which is at most five years away,
people will be issued with so-called "smartcards" with microchips that can
store their entire personal history. The identity cards will be a passport
for ordinary citizens, used to store health records, for personal banking
paying for travel and for identity checks at borders. <p>

In the same way, companies and even countries will be expected to use
technology like the encryption Clipper Chip for data transmissions. <p>

"We are defining our new electronic world - which will become increasingly
important in a borderless Europe," the EU security consultant said. <p>

A case has just concluded in England which may be significant for computer and
cryptographic evidence in general, and for electronic banking in particular.
It also give some interesting insights into the quality assurance and fraud
investigation practices of one of Britain's largest financial institutions. <p>

I will be talking about this case to the BCS Computer Law Special Interest
Group on Thursday 17th February at 6pm. The meeting will be held at the offices
of Bristows Cooke Carpmael, which can be found at 10 Lincoln's Inn Fields. To
get there, take the tube to Holborn, exit southwards and turn second left into
Remnant Street. <p>

For the sake of those who cannot make it, there follows a report of the case
from the notes I made during the hearing. <p>

*               *               *
1. Background. <p>

On February 8th, 10th and 11th, I attended the trial at Mildenhall Magistrates'
Court, Suffolk, England, of a man who was charged with attempting to obtain
money by deception after he complained that he had not made six of the
automatic teller machine transactions which appeared on his statement. <p>

The essence of the case was that John Munden, a police constable, had
complained to the manager of the Halifax Building Society in Newmarket about
these transactions, which appeared in September 1992. He had also stated that
his card had been in his possession at all times. Since the society was
satisifed about the security of its computer systems, it was alleged to follow
that Munden must have made these transactions, or suffered them to be made;
and thus that his complaint was dishonest. <p>

This trial had resumed after being adjourned in late 1993. According to the
clerk, evidence was given for the Crown at the initial hearing by Mr Beresford
of the Halifax Building Society that the society was satisfied that its systems
were secure, and so the transaction must have been made with the card and PIN
issued to the customer. Beresford had no expert knowledge of computer systems,
and had not done the investigation himself, but had left it to a member of his
department. He said that fraudulent transactions were rarely if ever made from
lobby ATMs because of the visible cameras. The Newmarket branch manager, Mr
Morgan, testified that one of the transactions at issue had indeed been made
from a machine inside the branch. He also said that in his opinion the
defendant had been convinced that he had not made the transaction; and that he
would not be aware of all the possible malfunctions of the ATM. <p>

The defence had objected that the evidence about the reliability of the
computer systems was inadmissible as Beresford was not an expert. The court
allowed the prosecution an adjournment to go and look for some evidence; and
at the last minute, on the 20th January, I was instructed by Mr Munden's
solicitor to act as an expert witness for the defence. <p>

2. The Prosecution Case. <p>

On 8th February, Beresford's evidence resumed. He admitted that the Halifax
had some 150-200 `unresolved' transactions over the previous 3-4 years, and
that it would be possible for a villain to observe someone's PIN at the ATM
and then make up a card to use on the account. He confirmed that the person
who investigated the incident had no technical qualifications, had acted under
his authority rather than under his direct supervision, and had involved the
police without consulting him. <p>

Evidence was next given by Mr Dawson, the Halifax's technical support manager.
He had originally written the bank's online system in 1971, and was now
responsible for its development and maintenance. The ATM system had been
written in 1978 for IBM 3600 series machines, and altered in 1981 when the
Diebold machines currently in use were purchased. All software was written
internally, and in the case of the mainframe element, this had accreted to
the nucleus originally written in 1971. Amendments to the online system are
made at the rate of 2-3 per week. <p>

The PIN encryption scheme used was nonstandard. The PIN was encrypted twice
at the ATM and then once more in the branch minicomputer which controls it.
At the mainframe, the outer two of these encryptions were stripped off and
the now singly encrypted PIN was encrypted once more with another key; the
16 digit result was compared with a value stored on the main file record and
on the online enquiry file. <p>

When asked whether system programmers could get access to the mainframe
encryption software, he categorically denied that this was possible as the
software could only be called by an authorised program. <p>

When asked whether someone with access to the branch minicomputer could view
the encrypted PIN, he denied that this was possible as there were no routines
to view this particular record (even although the mini received this field and
had PCs attached to it). When asked what operating system the mini used, he
said that it was called either TOS or TOSS and that he thought it had been
written in Sweden. He could give no more information. <p>

He had never heard of ITSEC. <p>

He had not investigated any of the other 150-200 `unresolved transactions'
because he had not been asked to. The last investigation he had done was of
another transaction which had led to a court case, three years previously;
he had no idea what proportion of transactions went wrong, was not privy to
out-of-balance reports from branches, and was not familiar with branch rules on
ATM operations. He never visited the branch at Newmarket, where the disputed
transactions took place, but merely looked at the mainframe records to see
whether any fault records or error codes. He found none and took this
information at face value. <p>

The fault recording system does not show repairs. The cryptographic keys in
the ATM are not zeroed when the machine is opened for servicing. The
maintenance is done by a third party. The branch only loads initial keys into
the ATM if keys are lost. <p>

The Halifax has no computer security function as such, just the internal
auditors and the technical staff; it does not use the term `quality assurance'. <p>

When asked by the bench what information was required to construct a card,
Dawson initially said the institution identifier, the account number, the
expiry date, a service code, an ISO check digit, a proprietary check digit,
and a card version number. He concluded from this that a card forger would
have to have access to an original card. However it turned out that the ATM
system only checks the institution identifier, the account number and the card
version number. He maintained doggedly that a forger would still have to
guess the version number, or determine it by trial and error, and claimed
there was no record of an incorrect version number card being used. <p>

However, Munden's card was version 2, and it transpired later that version 1,
though created, was not issued to him; and that an enquiry had been made from a
branch terminal two weeks before the disputed transactions (the person making
this enquiry could not be identified). When asked whether private investigators
could get hold of customer account details, as had been widely reported in the
press, he just shrugged. <p>

He claimed that the system had been given a clean bill of health by the
internal and external auditors. <p>

The branch manager was recalled and examined on balancing procedures. He
described the process, and how as a matter of policy the balancing records
were kept for two years. However the balancing records for the two machines
in question could not be produced. <p>

There was then police evidence to the effect that Munden kept respectable
records of his domestic accounts, which included references to the undisputed
withdrawals from ATMs, and that although he had once bounced a cheque he was
no more in financial difficulty than anybody else. The investigating officer
had only had evidence from the branch manager, not from Beresford or Dawson.
The investigating officer also reported that Munden had served in the police
force for nineteen years and that he had on occasion been commended by the
Chief Constable. <p>

3. The Defence. <p>

That concluded the prosecution case, and the defence case opened with Munden
giving evidence. He denied making the transactions but could not produce an
alibi other than his wife for the times at which the alleged withdrawals had
taken place. <p>

The only unusual matter to emerge from Munden's testimony was that when he went
in to the branch to complain, the manager had asked him how his holiday in
Ireland went. Munden was dumbfounded and the branch manager said that the
transaction code for one of the ATM withdrawals corresponded to their branch
in Omagh. This was not apparent from the records eventually produced in court. <p>

The next witness was his wife, Mrs Munden. Her evidence produced a serious
upset: it turned out that she had had a county court judgment against her, in a
dispute about paying for furniture which she claimed had been defective, some
two weeks before the disputed withdrawals took place. Her husband had not
known about this judgement until it emerged in court. <p>

I gave expert evidence to the effect that the Halifax's quality procedures,
as described by Dawson, fell far short of what might be expected; that testing
of software should be done by an independent team, rather than by the
programmers and analysts who created it; and that Dawson could not be
considered competent to pronounce on the security of the online system, and he
had designed it and was responsible for it. <p>

At a more detailed level, I informed the court that both national and
international ATM network standards require that PIN encryption be conducted in
secure hardware, rather than software; that the reason for this was that it
was indeed possible for system programmers to extract encryption keys from
software, and that I understood this to have been the modus operandi of a
sustained fraud against the customers of a London clearing bank in 1985-6;
that I had been involved in other ATM cases, in which some two dozen
different types of attack had emerged and which involved over 2000 complaints
in the UK; and that the Halifax, uniquely among financial institutions, was a
defendant in civil test cases in both England and Scotland. <p>

I continued that ATM cameras are used by a number of other UK institutions,
including the Alliance and Leicester Building Society, to resolve such cases;
that in other countries which I have investigated the practice would be not
to prosecute without an ATM photograph, or some other direct evidence such as a
numbered banknote being found on the accused; that card forgery techniques were
well known in the prison system, thanks to a document written by a man who had
been jailed at Winchester some two years previously for card offences; that I
had personally carried out the experiment of manufacturing a card from an
observed PIN and discarded ticket, albeit with the account holder's consent and
on an account with Barclays rather than the Halifax; that the PIN pad at the
Halifax's Diebold ATM in Cambridge was so sited as to be easily visible from
across the road; and that in any case the investigative procedures followed in
the case left very much to be desired. <p>

In cross examination, the prosecutor tried to score the usual petty points: he
attacked my impartiality on the grounds that I am assisting the Organised Crime
Squad at Scotland Yard to investigate criminal wrongdoing in financial
institutions (the reply from our lawyer was of course that helping the
prosecution as well as the defence was hardly evidence of partiality); he
claimed that the PIN pad at the ATM in Newmarket was differently sited to
that in Cambridge, to which I had no answer as I had not had the time to go
there; and he asserted that the Alliance and Leicester did not use ATM cameras.
On this point I was able to shoot him down as I had advised that institution's
supplier. He finally tried to draw from me an alternative theory of the
disputed transactions - staff fraud, or a villain whom Munden had booked in
the past getting his own back by means of a forged card, or a pure technical
glitch? I was unable to do this as there had been neither the time nor the
opportunity to demand technical disclosure from the Halifax, as had been the
case in two previous criminal cases I had helped defend (both of which we
incidentally won). <p>

Dawson was recalled by the prosecution. He explained that only two of the
three tests carried out on new software were done by the analysis and
programmers who had written it, and that the third or `mass test' was done by
an independent team. He said that software failures could not cause false
transactions to appear, since the online system was written in assembler, with
the result that errors caused an abend. <p>

He claimed that they did indeed possess a hardware security module, which was
bought in 1987 when they joined VISA, and which they used for interchange
transactions with VISA and Link although not for all transactions with their
own customers; and he finally repeated his categorical denial that any system
programmer could get at the encryption software. When asked by what mechanism
this was enforced, he said that they used a program called ACF2. <p>

In his closing speech, the defendant's lawyer pointed out the lack of any
apparent motive, and went on to point out the lack of evidence: the balancing
records were not produced; the person responsible for attending to those ATM
malfunctions which the branch could not cope with was not identified; the
Halifax employee who had carried out the investigation was not called; the
handwriting on the ATM audit rolls, which was the only way to tie them to a
particular machine, could not be identified; the cameras were not working;
statements were not taken from branch staff; the disk in the ATM had not
been produced; and the internal and external audit reports were not produced. <p>

He mentioned my expert opinion, and reiterated my point that when a designer of
a system says that he can't find anything wrong, what has he shown? He also
recalled that in the High Court action in which the Halifax is the defendant,
they had not relied on the alleged infallibility; and pointed out that if ATM
systems worked properly, then people wouldn't need to go to keep going to law
about them. <p>

4. The Verdict and Its Consequences. <p>

I have been aware for years that the legal system's signal-to-noise ratio is
less than 10dB; however, in view of the above, you can understand that it was
with some considerable surprise that I learned late on Friday that the court
had convicted Munden. My own reaction to the case has been to withdraw my money
from the Halifax and close my account there. Quite apart from their ramshackle
systems, the idea that complaining about a computer error could land me in
prison is beyond my tolerance limit. <p>

No doubt it will take some time for the broader lessons to sink in. What is the
point, for example, of buying hardware encryption devices if people can get
away with claiming that system programmers can never get at an authorised
library? Why invest in elaborate digital signature schemes if they simply
repair the banks' defence that the system cannot be wrong? Is there not a case
for giving more consideration to the legal and political consequences of
computer security designs? <p>

5. Action. <p>

In the meantime, the police investigations branch have to consider whether John
Munden will lose his job, and with it his house and his pension. In this
regard, it might just possibly be helpful if anyone who feels that Dawson's
evidence was untruthful on the point that software can be protected from system
programmers on an IBM compatible mainframe, or that his evidence was otherwise
unsatisfactory, could write expressing their opinion to the Chief Constable,
Cambridgeshire Constabulary, Hinchingbrooke Park, Huntingdon, England PE18 8NP. <p>

CARD FRAUD AND COMPUTER EVIDENCE <p>

From: rja14@cl.cam.ac.uk (Ross Anderson)
Subject: CARD FRAUD AND COMPUTER EVIDENCE
Organization: U of Cambridge Computer Lab, UK
Date: Mon, 14 Feb 1994 13:36:50 GMT <p>

A case has just concluded in England which may be significant for computer and
cryptographic evidence in general, and for electronic banking in particular.
It also give some interesting insights into the quality assurance and fraud
investigation practices of one of Britain's largest financial institutions. <p>

I will be talking about this case to the BCS Computer Law Special Interest
Group on Thursday 17th February at 6pm. The meeting will be held at the offices
of Bristows Cooke Carpmael, which can be found at 10 Lincoln's Inn Fields. To
get there, take the tube to Holborn, exit southwards and turn second left into
Remnant Street. <p>

For the sake of those who cannot make it, there follows a report of the case
from the notes I made during the hearing. <p>

*               *               *
1. Background. <p>

On February 8th, 10th and 11th, I attended the trial at Mildenhall Magistrates'
Court, Suffolk, England, of a man who was charged with attempting to obtain
money by deception after he complained that he had not made six of the
automatic teller machine transactions which appeared on his statement. <p>

The essence of the case was that John Munden, a police constable, had
complained to the manager of the Halifax Building Society in Newmarket about
these transactions, which appeared in September 1992. He had also stated that
his card had been in his possession at all times. Since the society was
satisifed about the security of its computer systems, it was alleged to follow
that Munden must have made these transactions, or suffered them to be made;
and thus that his complaint was dishonest. <p>

This trial had resumed after being adjourned in late 1993. According to the
clerk, evidence was given for the Crown at the initial hearing by Mr Beresford
of the Halifax Building Society that the society was satisfied that its systems
were secure, and so the transaction must have been made with the card and PIN
issued to the customer. Beresford had no expert knowledge of computer systems,
and had not done the investigation himself, but had left it to a member of his
department. He said that fraudulent transactions were rarely if ever made from
lobby ATMs because of the visible cameras. The Newmarket branch manager, Mr
Morgan, testified that one of the transactions at issue had indeed been made
from a machine inside the branch. He also said that in his opinion the
defendant had been convinced that he had not made the transaction; and that he
would not be aware of all the possible malfunctions of the ATM. <p>

The defence had objected that the evidence about the reliability of the
computer systems was inadmissible as Beresford was not an expert. The court
allowed the prosecution an adjournment to go and look for some evidence; and
at the last minute, on the 20th January, I was instructed by Mr Munden's
solicitor to act as an expert witness for the defence. <p>

2. The Prosecution Case. <p>

On 8th February, Beresford's evidence resumed. He admitted that the Halifax
had some 150-200 `unresolved' transactions over the previous 3-4 years, and
that it would be possible for a villain to observe someone's PIN at the ATM
and then make up a card to use on the account. He confirmed that the person
who investigated the incident had no technical qualifications, had acted under
his authority rather than under his direct supervision, and had involved the
police without consulting him. <p>

Evidence was next given by Mr Dawson, the Halifax's technical support manager.
He had originally written the bank's online system in 1971, and was now
responsible for its development and maintenance. The ATM system had been
written in 1978 for IBM 3600 series machines, and altered in 1981 when the
Diebold machines currently in use were purchased. All software was written
internally, and in the case of the mainframe element, this had accreted to
the nucleus originally written in 1971. Amendments to the online system are
made at the rate of 2-3 per week. <p>

The PIN encryption scheme used was nonstandard. The PIN was encrypted twice
at the ATM and then once more in the branch minicomputer which controls it.
At the mainframe, the outer two of these encryptions were stripped off and
the now singly encrypted PIN was encrypted once more with another key; the
16 digit result was compared with a value stored on the main file record and
on the online enquiry file. <p>

When asked whether system programmers could get access to the mainframe
encryption software, he categorically denied that this was possible as the
software could only be called by an authorised program. <p>

When asked whether someone with access to the branch minicomputer could view
the encrypted PIN, he denied that this was possible as there were no routines
to view this particular record (even although the mini received this field and
had PCs attached to it). When asked what operating system the mini used, he
said that it was called either TOS or TOSS and that he thought it had been
written in Sweden. He could give no more information. <p>

He had never heard of ITSEC. <p>

He had not investigated any of the other 150-200 `unresolved transactions'
because he had not been asked to. The last investigation he had done was of
another transaction which had led to a court case, three years previously;
he had no idea what proportion of transactions went wrong, was not privy to
out-of-balance reports from branches, and was not familiar with branch rules on
ATM operations. He never visited the branch at Newmarket, where the disputed
transactions took place, but merely looked at the mainframe records to see
whether any fault records or error codes. He found none and took this
information at face value. <p>

The fault recording system does not show repairs. The cryptographic keys in
the ATM are not zeroed when the machine is opened for servicing. The
maintenance is done by a third party. The branch only loads initial keys into
the ATM if keys are lost. <p>

The Halifax has no computer security function as such, just the internal
auditors and the technical staff; it does not use the term `quality assurance'. <p>

When asked by the bench what information was required to construct a card,
Dawson initially said the institution identifier, the account number, the
expiry date, a service code, an ISO check digit, a proprietary check digit,
and a card version number. He concluded from this that a card forger would
have to have access to an original card. However it turned out that the ATM
system only checks the institution identifier, the account number and the card
version number. He maintained doggedly that a forger would still have to
guess the version number, or determine it by trial and error, and claimed
there was no record of an incorrect version number card being used. <p>

However, Munden's card was version 2, and it transpired later that version 1,
though created, was not issued to him; and that an enquiry had been made from a
branch terminal two weeks before the disputed transactions (the person making
this enquiry could not be identified). When asked whether private investigators
could get hold of customer account details, as had been widely reported in the
press, he just shrugged. <p>

He claimed that the system had been given a clean bill of health by the
internal and external auditors. <p>

The branch manager was recalled and examined on balancing procedures. He
described the process, and how as a matter of policy the balancing records
were kept for two years. However the balancing records for the two machines
in question could not be produced. <p>

There was then police evidence to the effect that Munden kept respectable
records of his domestic accounts, which included references to the undisputed
withdrawals from ATMs, and that although he had once bounced a cheque he was
no more in financial difficulty than anybody else. The investigating officer
had only had evidence from the branch manager, not from Beresford or Dawson.
The investigating officer also reported that Munden had served in the police
force for nineteen years and that he had on occasion been commended by the
Chief Constable. <p>

3. The Defence. <p>

That concluded the prosecution case, and the defence case opened with Munden
giving evidence. He denied making the transactions but could not produce an
alibi other than his wife for the times at which the alleged withdrawals had
taken place. <p>

The only unusual matter to emerge from Munden's testimony was that when he went
in to the branch to complain, the manager had asked him how his holiday in
Ireland went. Munden was dumbfounded and the branch manager said that the
transaction code for one of the ATM withdrawals corresponded to their branch
in Omagh. This was not apparent from the records eventually produced in court. <p>

William Safire SINK THE CLIPPER CHIP NY Times (copyright material so for personal use only) <p>

New York Times:  Monday, February 14, 1994 <p>

Essay <p>

William Safire <p>

SINK THE CLIPPER CHIP <p>

Washington <p>

Well-meaning law and intelligence officials, vainly seeking to maintain
their vanishing ability to eavesdrop, have come up with a scheme that
endangers the personal freedom of every American. <p>

Nobody doubts that F.B.I. wiretaps help catch crooks or that the National
Security Agency's "Big Ears" alert us to the plans of terrorists.  And
nobody can deny that new technology makes it easier for the bad guys to
encode their communications to avoid the eavesdropping of the good guys. <p>

But the solution that faceless Clinton officials are putting forward shows
outdated law enforcement rooted in abysmal understanding of the
information explosion. <p>

The Clinton notion, recycled from an aborted Bush idea, is to put the same
encryption chip; in every telephone and computer made in the U.S.  This
new encoding device, or scrambler, would help you and me protect the
privacy of our conversations and messages and bank accounts from each
other.  That sounds great, but here comes the catch:  The Federal
Government would know and be able to use the code numbers to wiretap each
of us. <p>

To the tune of "I Got Algorithm," the Eavesdrop Establishment is singing
that it will help us protect our privacy --- but not from intrusion by the
Feds.  In effect, its proposal demands we turn over to Washington a
duplicate set of keys to our homes, formerly our castles, where not even
the king in olden times could go. <p>

The "clipper chip" --- aptly named, as it clips the wings of individual
liberty --- would encode, for Federal perusal whenever a judge rubber-
stamped a warrant, everything we say on a phone, everything we write on a
computer, every order we give to a shopping network or bank or 800 or 900
number, every electronic note we leave our spouses or dictate to our
personal-digit-assistant genies. <p>

Add to that stack of intimate date the medical information derived from
the national "health security card" Mr. Clinton proposes we all carry.
Combine it with the travel, shopping and credit data available from all
our plastic cards, along with psychological and student test scores.
Throw in the confidential tax returns, sealed divorce proceedings, welfare
records, field investigations for job applications, raw files and C.I.A.
dossiers available to the Feds, and you have the individual citizen
standing naked to the nosy bureaucrat. <p>

Assure us not that our personal life stories will be "safeguarded" by
multiple escrows in the brave new world of snooperware; we saw only last
month how political appointees can rifle the old-fashioned files of
candidates and get off scot-free.  Whenever personal information is
amassed and readily available, it will be examined by the curious, and if
it is valuable, it will be stolen by political hackers. <p>

Ah, but wouldn't it be helpful to society to have instant access to the
encoded communications of a Mafia capo, or a terrorist ordering the
blow-up of a skyscraper, or a banker financing a dictator's nuclear
development? <p>

Sure it would.  That's why no self-respecting vice overlord or terrorist
or local drug-runner would buy or use clipper-chipped American
telecommunications equipment.  They would buy non-American hardware with
unmonitored Japanese or German or Indian encryption chips and laugh all
the way to the plutonium factory. <p>

The only people tap-able by American agents would be honest Americans ---
or those crooked Americans dopey enough to buy American equipment with the
pre-compromised American code.  Subsequent laws to mandate the F.B.I.
bug in every transmitter would be as effective as today's laws banning
radar detectors. <p>

Tomorrow's law enforcement and espionage cannot be planned by people stuck
in the wiretap and Big Ear mind-set of the past.  The new Ultra secret
is that the paradigm has shifted; encryption has overcome decryption. <p>

Billions now spent on passive technical surveillance must be shifted to
active means of learning criminal or aggressive plans.  Human informers
must be recruited or placed, as "sigint" declines and "humint" rises in
the new era; psychic as well as monetary rewards for ratting must be
raised; governments must collude closely to trace transfers of wealth. <p>

Cash in your clipper chips, wiretappers:  you can't detect the crime wave
of the future with those old earphones on. <p>

PREFACE <p>

The following notes on the subject meeting were prepared by Paul Evan
Peters, Executive Director, Coalition for Networked Information, to
quickly convey some sense of the meeting to the subscribers of the cni-
announce Internet distribution service and to other interested and
concerned parties. <p>

The discussions at this meeting flowed quickly and ranged widely.  It
was not possible to capture what each person said, or even to always
identify exactly who was speaking.  The following notes attempt to
provide an appreciation for the topics that were covered in the order
they arose, but they do not attribute specific remarks to individual
persons. <p>

Additional information about this meeting and related matters will be
distributed, as soon as it becomes available, via cni-announce.  Other
information of interest can be obtained, in addition to other means, by
gophering to cni.org and iitf.doc.gov. <p>

MEETING NOTES <p>

Chairman Lewis (National Public Radio) opened.  All members of the
Council have made it clear that they are happy to give advice to the
Secretary of Commerce and the rest of the Administration on these
matters. <p>

Chairman McCracken (Silicon Graphics) continued.  A cold requires that
Chairman Lewis preside for most of this meeting.  NII should yield a
more productive society, more jobs, more economic gains in general, and
a more competitive economy.  NII is the keystone of Administration's
technology policy.  This Council needs to generate a common view on a
few key subjects.  NII is currently a big amorphous idea that means so
much to each of us.  We are still very much at the "wish list" stage.
This Council represents the country to the Administration.  This Council
needs to focus on a few key issues. <p>

Each member of the Council introduced herself or himself, and made a
brief statement about her or his interests and priorities. <p>

Chairmain Lewis remarked on the common threads from this round-robins of
intoductions and statements:  the need for NII access, openness, and
partnerships, and the desire to be a substantive, effective council.
Members want to play a role in defining what the NII is.  In preparation
for the next meeting of the Council, each member will submit a one to
two page statement on this subject, including a list of priority issues. <p>

Reports were presented by the chairs of each of the three committees
that support the Administration's Information Infrastructure Task Force
(IITF):  Arati Prabhakar reported on the IITF Committee on Applications
and Technology;  Sally Katzen reported on the IITF Committee on
Information Policy;  and, Larry Irving reported on the IITF Committee on
Telecommunications Policy.  Brief discussions of what each committee
would like in the way of assistance from (members of) the Council. <p>

Chairman Lewis called for discussion. <p>

*  Where is "universal service" going? <p>

-  The Administration believes that a dynamic concept must be
developed, something that will evolve as technology continues to change.
The Administration also wants to broaden the base of entities paying
into the subsidy pools that make universal service possible. <p>

-  Are we going to have Federal preemption or will we have 50+
definitions?  There are state-by-state differences, and the Federal
policy must account for those differences subject to some national
consensus regarding a minimum level of service. <p>

-  Are we talking about transport only or are we also talking about
content as well?  In the telephony period it meant only transport.  We
clearly needed an expanded definition of some sort. <p>

Chairman Lewis recognized Secretary of Commerce Brown upon his arrival. <p>

Secretary Brown welcomed the Council.  Appreciates energy and diversity
of group.  Genuinely want to hear whatever the Council chooses to offer.
In areas as important of this one, the Federal goverment cannot listen
enough.  The Council's advice is needed to void the law of unintended
consequences in this instance.  We want to ensure universal service,
interoperability, investment, and competition. <p>

Chairman Lewis called for discussion. <p>

*  In addition to the four things that the Secretary ended with, we need
to educate the public in a real way on why we are working on the NII to
begin with. <p>

*  This Council has to look at the problems to be be solved and created
by the NII below the level of 50,000 feet.  The opportunity before this
Council is to talk in real terms about real impacts.  Let's home it on
the specific actions that the government must take. <p>

*  Access to free public education and to free public libraries is
something that we as a society decided long ago, and we have to make
sure that the NII moves us forward rather than back in these terms. <p>

*  We need to avoid "entitlement thinking," thinking that leads to
programs which transfer funds from one sector to another without clear
articulation of goals and accountability of results. <p>

*  Even so, we need to talk in real terms about how to use the NII to
get more information to more people without cost being a factor.  We
need to develop markets, yes;  but we also need to provide for all of
our citizens in certain basic ways without conveying a sense of "you are
needy and therefore unworthy." <p>

*  We must avoid a "one size will fit all" mentality.  Where the
information comes from and who paid for its creation are important
considerations. <p>

*  It is important not to confuse cost, price, and value. <p>

*  This talk is all well and good, but there is legislation pending and
government actions being considered.  It is not clear that those
proceedings are taking any consideration of the issues that we are
discussing, and that they even care that this Council exists. <p>

-  Even if the Council cannot reach consensus on some of the matters
that will break in the near future, all of us will be edified by the
discussion, each of us has numerous private ways to influence the course
of events, and there will be issues calling for our attention for come
time to come. <p>

Secretary Brown recognized Vice President Gore upon his arrival. <p>

Vice President Gore welcomed the Council.  Appreciate the spirit and
enthusiasm with which all of you are entering into this work.  We are
relying on you for advice and input in more ways than you can imagine.
In the government we are keenly aware of what we don't know, and that
the real drivers of this transition are in the private sector;  first
comes the hardware, then comes the software, and, after a significant
delay, then comes the policy.  :-)  I am especially interested in your
ideas on how we can achieve universal service.  But enough from me ... I
am here to listen. <p>

Chairman Lewis called for discussion. <p>

*  We are concerned first with what the NII is, then we will turn to how
to provide the NII.  We are also mindful of the fact that the life cycle
of telecommunications policy is fifty years, more or less.  Must the
"information superhighway" give way to the "information supermarket"
during that period? <p>

*  The prior policy framework *awarded* monopolies and *required*
universal service.  We are on new ground with this Administration's
policy framework, a framework that strives to promote *competition* and
which *calls* for universal service. <p>

*  One specific question to prime this thought process that was used in
a previous period (start-up of the cable industry) is "Should the
superbowl be broadcast for free?". <p>

*  Universal access is quite different from universal service, as the
use of these phrases in the health care debate illustrates.  Service is
the much preferrable term. <p>

*  There is also a difference between subsidizing services and
subsidizing people. <p>

*  It is also important to formulate a symmetric policy, one that looks
to providers of services as well as to consumers of services. <p>

*  The difference between "affordable" and "reasonable" prices is also
important. <p>

*  There are three basic components of telecommunication costs:
connection, time, and intellectual property.  We should keep open the
possibility of not charging schools and libraries for time. <p>

*  Competition and not subsidies should drive this process.  We need to
make sure that we get as much as we can from competition before we turn
to subsidies.  After all, legal electronic publishers find it
competitively advantageous to offer their products and services at low
prices to law school students. <p>

-  Loss leader stragegies may make sense in professional education,
but they do not make sense in elementary and secondary education. <p>

-  There are also markets that private interests don't compete for. <p>

*  Glad to be part of the dialog on this big picture, and to hear that
the Council has not been convened for rubber stamping Administration
views and proposals.  In this spirit, the Administration is well-advised
to reconsider its Clipper encryption strategy. <p>

-  This proposal brings the clash between privacy, security, and law
enforcement to the front burner before we have built our national
consensus on how to balance these interests. <p>

-  Many countries do not allow encryption at all. <p>

-  What's more, encryption and code breaking has determined at least
one world war already. <p>

Chairman Lewis closed the discussion by taking note of the time. <p>

Chairman Lewis announced that the Council's next meetings are
tentatively scheduled for March 18th, April 25th, and June 17th.  He
noted that these meetings will likely be held in DC, but commented that
this has not been decided and there is some sentiment that the meetings
be moved around or that regional meetings of some description be held. <p>

Chairman Lewis adjourned the meeting with thanks to all involved. <p>

from a UK contributor " hardware crypto is a dog as far as markets are concerned" <p>

&gt;&gt;Given that GCHQ's main mission these days is sigint support for the
&gt;&gt;FBI, it's hard to see how they could avoid involvement [on clipper]
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Nonetheless, hardware crypto is a dog as far as markets are
&gt;&gt;concerned. The future is with software, and we held a workshop last
&gt;&gt;December of fast software encryption which elicited a dozen new
&gt;&gt;algorithms (including from the likes of Don Coppersmith, Jim

FIRP report comments -- forward to your lists if you wish <p>

Date: Tue, 15 Feb 94 17:12:30 -0500
From: Stephen D Crocker &lt;crocker@tis.com&gt; <p>

These are the meat of the comments I've supplied in response to the
draft FIRP report.

     Response to the Draft Report of the Federal Internetworking
              Requirements Panel (FIRP), 14 January 1994 <p>

Part 1: Strategic Comments <p>

Stephen D. Crocker
          Vice President, Trusted Information Systems, Inc.
                     IETF Security Area Director <p>

15 February 1994 <p>

INTRODUCTION <p>

"The Federal Internetworking Requirements Panel (FIRP) was established
by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to
reassess federal requirements for open systems networks and to
recommend policy on the [U.S.] Government's use of networking
standards."  [Preface, para 1.] <p>

The FIRP report describes the need for the U.S. Federal Government to
embrace not only the OSI protocol suite but also the ubiquitous TCP/IP
Protocol Suite.  In fact, Internet Standards, which include the TCP/IP
Protocol Suite, are in very wide use in the Government, throughout the
U.S. and throughout the world.  Some OSI products and systems exist,
and it may be impossible to switch completely to TCP/IP-based systems.
Nonetheless, the report says, it is time to acknowledge the widespread
use of the Internet Standards and give formal sanction to their use in
the Government. <p>

This is indeed a welcome change, and it should help the Government
take better advantage of modern data networking. <p>

This memo is the first of two responses to the report.  In this memo,
some issues are raised with respect to the recommendations in the FIRP
report, and suggestions are made for avoiding problems in the future. <p>

In the other memo, comments are given with respect to specific
sections of the report. <p>

STRATEGIC COMMENTS <p>

This panel was convened in response to a divergence between the
strategy the U.S. Federal Government had been following for several
years and the direction of the marketplace.  As the report makes
clear, the divergence had become so great that the policy no longer
reflected attainable objectives.  The accommodation of the Internet
Standards brings policy into line with widespread practice and removes
obstacles for rational management decisions in the future. <p>

In this light, it's worth examining the recommendations to ascertain
if they are sufficient to avoid similar problems in the future.  As
with any large organization, the U.S. Federal Government pursues
multiple policy objectives and has ingrained organizational
imperatives.  Recommendations that respond only to the current
marketplace without also anticipating the future or without including
the flexibility to follow the lead of the marketplace may lead to the
convening of a similar panel in the not too distant future. <p>

The FIRP report makes five recommendations: <p>

1. The role of oversight and integration across federal agency
  internetworking activities should be strengthened within the Office of
  Management and Budget. <p>

2. The roles and responsibilities for fostering standards and
  assessing technological change should be refocused and strengthened by
  the Department of Commerce. <p>

3. The roles and responsibilities for infrastructure development and
  operations to support all internetworking services from advanced
  research and development to leading edge to core/commodity services
  should be clearly defined and formally assigned through the
  Information Infrastructure Task Force. <p>

4. The roles and responsibilities of affinity groups should be
  defined, including how they are created and coordinated by the
  Government Information Technology Services working group. <p>

5. In accordance with OMB Circular A-119, Revised October 1992,
  voluntary standards should be adopted and used by Federal agencies,
  and international standards should be considered in the interests of
  promoting trade.  The current GOSIP policy should be modified by the
  Department of Commerce to reflect the wider range of international
  voluntary standards for internetworking. <p>

Recommendation 1 asks that OMB's role be strengthened.  OMB has the
charter to review the roles, responsibilities and performances of the
various agencies which provide, develop or guide the U.S. Government's
internetworking activities. <p>

This is an important role.  The OMB should develop guidelines for
measuring the performance of the assigned agencies and the attainment
of the overall objectives.  Although there is usually a preference to
avoid duplication of activities, some degree of competition,
exploration of alternative strategies and comparison of results is
desirable because it tends to produce more cost effective products and
services that are better matched to the needs of the users.  Wherever
feasible, the OMB should also foster multiple approaches and/or
participation by multiple agencies in order to provide for maximum
feedback within the system. <p>

Recommendation 2 suggests the Department of Commerce be tasked with
new responsibility for "fostering standards." <p>

Presumably the context of this recommendation is with respect to
internal standards within the U.S.  Government.  The general arena for
developing Internet Standards is the Internet Engineering Task Force
(IETF) which operates in conjunction with the Internet Architecture
Board (IAB) under the auspices of the Internet Society.  The Internet
Society, along with NSF, ARPA, DOE and NASA, provide considerable
financial support to the standards activities.  This process enjoys
wide spread support form the industrial, academic and government
communities, and as a result, the standards developed in this arena
reflect the needs of marketplace and are usually adopted widely and
quickly. <p>

Even if this recommendation is understood to be limited to refer to
internal use of the U.S. Government, the recommendation is flawed.
"Department of Commerce" here certainly includes NIST, but is likely
to include other parts of the Department.  While NIST is indeed the
federal agency tasked with promoting and developing standards, NIST
and the rest of the Department have at least two difficulties to
overcome. <p>

First, NIST has been the lead agency with respect to GOSIP.  NIST
personnel are deeply knowledgeable about the OSI suite and less
familiar with the TCP/IP Protocol Suite.  NIST is not now in a
position to provide leadership in this area, although it does have the
technical strength to follow, assist and participate in the ongoing
standards activities.  One challenge for NIST in the next few years
will be to strengthen its staff and adjust its direction to move
toward a stronger involvement in the Internet Standards activities.  A
significant part of this challenge is working in a standards arena in
which the U.S. Government does not have de jure authority or veto
power. <p>

Second, the Department of Commerce is heavily committed to a
particular strategy with respect to cryptography that is currently in
conflict with the forces in the marketplace.  NIST is the lead agency
involved in the promulgation of the Digital Signature Standard (DSS)
and the "Clipper" escrowed-key encryption system.  Both of these
initiatives are meeting very strong resistance from industry and
academia.  The RSA algorithm is the de facto standard for signatures
and key exchange, and some form of DES and/or some proprietary
algorithms, e.g. RC2 and RC4, are likely to be the de facto standards
for bulk encryption. <p>

The U.S. Government's orientation toward cryptography comes from the
specific concerns of the intelligence and law enforcement agencies.
While not denying the principle that the intelligence and law
enforcement agencies have legitimate concerns, it is far from clear
that the approach being taken by the Department in support of these
concerns will be successful.  In fact, it is entirely possible these
initiatives will not succeed in the marketplace.  If so, the result
will be the existence of dual standards in which the Government
algorithms will be used only under duress, both the Government and the
general population will bear unnecessary costs dealing with dual
standards, the introduction of strong security controls will be
retarded, and the intelligence and law enforcement agencies will not
succeed in preventing the use of strong encryption, except in so far
as they succeed in retarding the use of encryption altogether.  On
February 4, 1994, the Department announced it had made substantial
progress in its review of policies governing cryptography.  Its
announced that export controls on DES and similar cryptography will
remain in place, that the Department will continue to promulgate the
Digital Signature Standard despite uncertainties about the patent and
licenses, and it will adopt the escrowed encryption system (Clipper)
as a Government standard.  Nothing in the public record supports these
decisions, and it was made clear that these decisions are driven by
the views of the law enforcement and intelligence agencies. <p>

The purpose of citing these controversies concerning cryptography
policy here is to explicate a consequence relevant to the FIRP report.
The Commerce Department, and in particular NIST, have a conflict of
interest.  Like a lawyer with two clients with intertangled interests,
the Department is trying to serve two constituencies.  One
constituency is the federal government as a whole, and in that role,
it must do the best job it can of interpreting the market forces and
adopting federal standards that are consistent with the marketplace. <p>

The Department's other constituency is the particular needs of the law
enforcement and intelligence agencies.  Those agencies desire to
influence and change the direction of the marketplace.  In service of
this role, NIST is adopting federal standards that reflect the
direction the law enforcement and intelligence agencies want the
market to go. <p>

The only way for the Department to be successful is if the law
enforcement and intelligence agencies prevail and the marketplace
adopts the standards the Government is promulgating.  Perhaps this
will happen, and if so, the Government's gamble will pay off.
However, if the marketplace continues to adopt RSA as the preferred
public key algorithm, if DES and other non-escrowed algorithms are
used for symmetric key encryption, and if products with encryption are
become prevalent in non-U.S. markets, not only will the stated goals
of the law enforcement and intelligence communities be lost, the rest
of the federal government and indeed the rest of the country will have
paid the price in struggling with dual standards. <p>

Like a stubborn child with a tensed jaw, the U.S. Government seems
bent on pressing forward with these initiatives.  So be it.  But in
handing out accolades because NIST is now willing to accommodate the
protocols that have been commonplace for many years, it's fair to note
that NIST and the rest of the Department are engaged in an exercise
which promises to bring a repeat of the same divergence, confusion and
waste of resources which the FIRP report documents. <p>

Recommendation 3 suggests that each role and responsibility should be
tasked to some specific agency.  Apparently this is aimed at reducing
duplication.  While useful in principle, this approach is fragile.  If
the assigned agencies are incompetent or inefficient, everyone
suffers.  The report does suggest that some assignments may be
decentralized.  Decentralization should be emphasized.  Wherever
possible, multiple approaches and multiple agencies should be
encouraged.  Competition and comparison are enormously useful forces.
As noted above with respect to recommendation 1, the OMB should
encourage as much decentralization as possible and should oversee the
agencies establishing a means of measuring the results. <p>

Recommendations 4 and 5 are oriented toward implementation of the
first three recommendations and raise fewer strategic concerns except
that recommendation 5 implicitly acknowledges that the role of the
U.S. Government in the standards process shift from one of controlling
the process to one of participating in the process.  As noted above
with respect to recommendation 2, this shift poses an institutional
challenge for the Government in general and NIST in particular. <p>

"foreign press is *torching* U.S. snoop-n-peep project" <p>

from a friend <p>

[Just received this from an associate in Switzerland who is well-known to
many in the computer racket.  --jim] <p>

...
I've been meaning to ask you just
how much play the Clipper issue has gotten in the U.S. popular press.
I'm really surprised at how much coverage you see here, in press that's
the equivalent of Time/Newsweek/big city newspapers, and universally
negative.  Basically, as seen in the Swiss and French press, the US is
using its big stick muscle to ram a technology down the throats of
people worldwide so that NSA can snoop on them.  This is particularly
an issue in the case of GSM (global cellular phones), where the US has
pretty much won the battle to make Europe weaken its original super-tough
voice encryption, threatening to deny access to the internal U.S.
market if they do (and then they pull a switcheroo, after GSM is
weakened, by not adopting it but going for Clipper instead). <p>

The sense I got in the U.S. was that Clipper was still pretty much only
an issue in the technologically knowledeable subcommunity, so I'd
be interested to hear if it's now getting broader visibility.

[2] Safire Slams Clipper <p>

For those of you who might have missed it, William Safire published a
very good essay on the Clipper proposal yesterday (February 14). We're
providing some excerpts here and recommend the piece in its entirety.
Let's hope Safire can do for Clipper what he did for Bobby Inman. <p>

Well-meaning law and intelligence officials, vainly seeking to
  maintain their vanishing ability to eavesdrop, have come up with
  a scheme that endangers the personal freedom of every American. <p>

*     *     * <p>

The "clipper chip" --- aptly named, as it clips the wings of
  individual liberty --- would encode, for Federal perusal whenever a
  judge rubber-stamped a warrant, everything we say on a phone,
  everything we write on a computer, every order we give to a shopping
  network or bank or 800 or 900 number, every electronic note we leave
  our spouses or dictate to our personal-digit-assistant genies. <p>

Add to that stack of intimate data the medical information derived
  from the national "health security card" Mr. Clinton proposes we all
  carry. Combine it with the travel, shopping and credit data available
  from all our plastic cards, along with psychological and student test
  scores. Throw in the confidential tax returns, sealed divorce
  proceedings, welfare records, field investigations for job
  applications, raw files and C.I.A. dossiers available to the Feds, and
  you have the individual citizen standing naked to the nosy bureaucrat. <p>

*     *     * <p>

The only people tap-able by American agents would be honest Americans
  --- or those crooked Americans dopey enough to buy American equipment
  with the pre-compromised American code.  Subsequent laws to mandate the
  F.B.I. bug in every transmitter would be as effective as today's laws
  banning radar detectors. <p>

*     *     * <p>

Cash in your clipper chips, wiretappers:  you can't detect the crime
  wave of the future with those old earphones on. <p>

[3] A Tough Question <p>

During the briefing on February 4 at which the formal adoption of the
Escrowed Encryption Standard (aka Clipper) was announced, Mark Richards,
Deputy Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division,   was asked
the following hypothetical question: <p>

Suppose NSA goes to the key escrow agents and says, "We intercepted
  a Clipper-encrypted communication overseas.  No U.S. persons
  were parties, so the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act does
  not apply and we don't need a warrant."  How do the escrow
  agents determine whether or not to provide the keys?  Doesn't
  this create a huge loophole in the system? <p>

Richards' response was that there would be "some" mechanism developed to
ensure that there would be no abuse of the key escrow system, but added
that any such procedures "might not be made public."  The response was
less than assuring.  The development of secret procedures for foreign
intelligence use of escrowed keys does nothing to assure the public of
the system's integrity.  It creates a very real possibility that the key
escrow system will be based upon nothing more than NSA's unilateral
representations concerning the circumstances of a particular
interception. <p>

It was not at all apparent why these procedures couldn't be made public.
Like so much of the Clipper proposal, valid concerns are met with the
claim that "national security" precludes the disclosure of relevant
information.  This is why many of us believe this is a dangerous and
ill-advised way to design our civilian communications infrastructure. <p>

--------------------------------------------------------------- <p>

[4] Clipper Facts: Definition of "Tesserea" <p>

The Defense Department reportedly plans to employ the Clipper technology
in a device known as a "Tessera Card."  We checked the dictionary and
found the results to be kind of frightening: <p>

Terrerea n. Lat. (pl. tessereae).  Literally, "four-cornered".  Used
  to refer to four-legged tables, chairs, stools, etc.  Also, a single
  piece of mosaic tile; a single piece of a mosaic.  _Pol._: An identity
  chit or marker.  Tessereae were forced on conquered peoples and
  domestic slaves by their Roman occupiers or owners.  Slaves or Gauls
  who refused to accept a tesserea were branded or maimed as a form of
  identification. <p>

[5] Sign the Clipper Petition! <p>

Electronic Petition to Oppose Clipper
                      *Please Distribute Widely* <p>

On January 24, many of the nation's leading experts in cryptography and
computer security wrote President Clinton and asked him to withdraw the
Clipper proposal. <p>

The public response to the letter has been extremely favorable,
including coverage in the New York Times and numerous computer and
security trade magazines. <p>

Many people have expressed interest in adding their names to the letter.
In  response to these requests, CPSR is organizing an Internet petition
drive to oppose the Clipper proposal.  We will deliver the signed
petition to the White House, complete with the names of all the people
who oppose Clipper. <p>

To sign on to the letter, send a message to: <p>

Clipper.petition@cpsr.org <p>

with the message "I oppose Clipper" (no quotes) <p>

You will receive a return message confirming your vote. <p>

Please distribute this announcement so that others may also express
their opposition to the Clipper proposal. <p>

Life In Cyberspace <p>

By the way , if you look at the end you will see the "Information
Infrastructure Task Force has opened a  computer bulletin board for the
public. Anyone with a computer and  a modem can access it by calling (202)
501-1920.". Why in the H_LL is that not reachable via the Internet. Could
it be that those in charge of the IITF dont understand where the world is? <p>

BYLINE                Joshua Quittner
LENGTH                82   Lines <p>

WASHINGTON
     A RED-HAIRED MAN hustled up the steps to the Old Executive
Office Building in Washington right to the front of the line of 400 or
so people who stood stamping against the cold.
      His approach sent a murmur of recognition through the crowd on
Thursday. It was John Sculley, ex-chairman of Apple and now ex-
chief of Spectrum Information Technologies, and he was carrying the
world's biggest briefcase and wearing a wool hat, pulled down to his
bushy-red eyebrows. The hat had a small hole frayed in it, dead
center, and it made you think about how unemployment was treating
John Sculley.
      After a while, the line moved and slowly, the people on it were
  allowed in to watch the first meeting of the National Information
  Infrastructure Task Force. The Indian Treaty Room had been
reserved,which may have been someone's idea of irony. Many of the
natives of cyberspace already suspect they're going to be displaced
by the armies of Hollywood and Home Shopping. The room was
quickly abandoned in favor of something larger, across the hall.
       A long table stretched across the front of the room and 31
people (the task force) sat around it, half of them with their backs to
us. John Sculley sat facing the room. There was a blue velvet curtain
and an American flag for a backdrop.
      One of the first orders of business, was defining what, exactly,
the National Information Infrastructure is. "It's such a big,
amorphous idea, it means so much to each of us," said co-chairman
Delano Lewis, who also happens to be  the president of National
Public Radio. As an exercise, Lewis gave each of the members some
homework: Write two pages on the National Information
Infrastructure, "defining it   -  what it means."
      The National Information Infrastructure is not yet a household
phrase, though I'm pretty sure it refers to the interconnected
networks of fiber-optic and coaxial cable, phone lines, satellites and
broadcast towers that move the nation's communications. No one
agrees on what the proper metaphor is. During the three-hour-long
meeting, it was described as a national information superhighway; a
national information supermarket; a "river of information and we're
placing the buoys"; and a "fast train leaving the station and we don't
want to be the caboose."
      But the country doesn't need a common metaphor to start talking
about some of the problems it faces as this thing takes on a
recognizable form. One of the big issues is universal service: How
does the nation ensure that all people can get at information as it
migrates to pay services?
      This is where John Sculley comes in. "We need to find a way that
every American can go to a library and access online information
without having to pay for it," he said. And without easy, affordable
access, he said, classrooms would be crippled. It's funny what
unemployment will do  for your point of view.
       Now, Sculley's suggestion is not exactly outrageous. You go to a
library and you can read any book in the place for free. You can even
take books out if you have a card. So you'd expect the same idea
would carry over into the Information Age, when so much of the
information we need will be  available only online, for money.
      But Vance Opperman, president of West Publishing, almost
jumped out of his seat when Sculley said the words, "without having
to pay for it." West is one of the world's biggest online publishers.
      "If you have information available for free, soon you'll get what
you pay for," Opperman said. "John, I'm amazed. I don't think you're
suggesting that all information should be available for free . . . That
would be the end of the information industry in this country."
      Now Sculley did a funny thing. Maybe it was all those years of
running Pepsi and Apple that kicked in, or maybe it was the
shakiness of being without portfolio.
      He backed down. "I'm not suggesting we create more
entitlement," he said, flustered.
      Luckily, by this point,  Vice President Al Gore had joined the
group. Gore, as I'm sure you're aware, is the person in the federal
government most responsible for putting the National Information
Infrastructure in the public agenda. He was the one that introduced
the term "national information superhighway" into the vernacular.
      Gore held up his hand. "I'm not prepared to yield that point," he
said to Sculley, "that we should be providing information for free to
classrooms. I wouldn't want to prematurely take that off the burner,
not at all."
      Some of the panelists said later that it was good to have a vice
president who can not only spell potato, but can even find a digitized
photograph of one on the Internet.

CRYPTO CHIP DEBUTS iPower (note self destruct .. djf) <p>

&gt;&gt;From the News Briefs in Dr. Dobb's Developer Update, March 1994:
&gt;
&gt;CRYPTO CHIP DEBUTS
&gt;
&gt;National Semiconductor has released the iPower encryption chip,
&gt;which is designed for use in PCMCIA cards and provides a range
&gt;of security features. The chip can encrypt data via multiple
&gt;encryption algorithms, and will self-destruct upon any
&gt;tampering attempt, using a self-contained chemical. Cards that
&gt;use the iPower chip can also provide additional functions such
&gt;as tracking user access times. The iPower division is based [in]

CFS 1.0.4 Unix Cryptographic File System source code now available  -- thought you all would be interested in tech progress on this front .. djf] <p>

From: mab@research.att.com (Matt Blaze) <p>

Source code for version 1.0 of CFS, the Cryptographic File System, is
now available upon request for research and experimental use in the US
and Canada. <p>

CFS pushes encryption services into the Unix(tm) file system.  It
supports secure storage at the system level through a standard Unix
file system interface to encrypted files.  Users associate a
cryptographic key with the directories they wish to protect.  Files in
these directories (as well as their pathname components) are
transparently encrypted and decrypted with the specified key without
further user intervention; cleartext is never stored on a disk or sent
to a remote file server.  CFS employs a novel combination of DES
stream and codebook cipher modes to provide high security with good
performance on a modern workstation.  CFS can use any available file
system for its underlying storage without modification, including
remote file servers such as NFS.  System management functions, such as
file backup, work in a normal manner and without knowledge of the key. <p>

CFS runs under SunOS and several other BSD-derived systems with NFS.
It is implemented entirely at user level, as a local NFS server
running on the client machine's "loopback" interface.  It consists of
about 5000 lines of code and supporting documentation.  You must have
"root" access to install CFS. <p>

CFS was first mentioned at the work-in-progress session at the Winter
'93 USENIX Conference and was more fully detailed in: <p>

Matt Blaze, "A Cryptographic File System for Unix", Proc. 1st ACM
    Conference on Computer and Communications Security, Fairfax, VA,
    November 1993. (PostScript available by anonymous ftp from
    research.att.com in the file dist/mab/cfs.ps. <p>

The version being released differs from the version described in the
paper in a few ways: <p>

* The encryption scheme has been strengthened, and now provides
approximately the security of 3-DES with the online latency of only
single-DES. <p>

* Support for the smartcard-based key management system is not
included. <p>

* A few of the tools are not included (in particular, cname and ccat). <p>

* The performance has been improved. <p>

* The security of the system against certain non-cryptanalytic attacks
has been improved somewhat. <p>

CFS is being distributed as a research prototype; it is COMPLETELY
UNSUPPORTED software.  No warranty of any kind is provided.  We will
not be responsible if the system deletes all your files and emails the
cleartext directly to the NSA or your mother.  Also, we do not have
the resources to port the software to other platforms, although you
are welcome to do this yourself.  The software was developed under
SunOS and BSDI, and there are also unsupported user-contributed ports
available for AIX, HP/UX, Irix, Linux, Solaris and Ultrix.  We really
can't promise to provide any technical support at all, beyond the
source code itself.  We also maintain a mailing list for CFS users and
developers; subscription information is included with the source code. <p>

Because of export restrictions on cryptographic software, we are only
able to make the software available within the US and Canada to US and
Canadian citizens and permanent residents.  Unfortunately, we cannot
make it available for general anonymous ftp or other uncontrolled
access, nor can we allow others to do so.  Sorry. <p>

Jackboots on the Infobahn
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ <p>

Clipper is a last ditch attempt by the United States, the last great power
from the old Industrial Era, to establish imperial control over cyberspace. <p>

By John Perry Barlow <p>

On January 11, I managed to schmooze myself aboard Air Force 2. It was
flying out of LA, where its principal passenger had just outlined his
vision of the information superhighway to a suited mob of television, show-
biz, and cable types who  fervently hoped to own it one day - if they could
ever figure out what the hell it was. <p>

&gt;From the standpoint of the Electronic Frontier Foundation the speech had
been wildly encouraging. The administration's program, as announced by Vice
President Al Gore, incorporated many of the concepts of open competition,
universal access, and  deregulated common carriage that we'd been pushing
for the previous year. <p>

But he had said nothing about the future of privacy, except to cite among
the bounties of the NII its ability to "help law enforcement agencies
thwart criminals and terrorists who might use advanced telecommunications
to commit crimes." <p>

On the plane I asked Gore what this implied about administration policy on
cryptography. He became as noncommittal as a cigar-store Indian. "We'll be
making some announcements.... I can't tell you anything more." He hurried
to the front of the  plane, leaving me to troubled speculation. <p>

Despite its fundamental role in assuring privacy, transaction security, and
reliable identity within the NII, the Clinton administration has not
demonstrated an enlightenment about cryptography up to par with the rest of
its digital vision. <p>

The Clipper Chip - which threatens to be either the goofiest waste of
federal dollars since President Gerald Ford's great Swine Flu program or,
if actually deployed, a surveillance technology of profound malignancy -
seemed at first an ugly legacy  of the Reagan-Bush modus operandi. "This is
going to be our Bay of Pigs," one Clinton White House official told me at
the time Clipper was introduced, referring to the disastrous plan to invade
Cuba that Kennedy inherited from Eisenhower. <p>

(Clipper, in case you're just tuning in, is an encryption chip that the
National Security Agency and FBI hope will someday be in every phone and
computer in America. It scrambles your communications, making them
unintelligible to all but their  intended recipients. All, that is, but the
government, which would hold the "key" to your chip. The key would
separated into two pieces, held in escrow, and joined with the appropriate
"legal authority.") <p>

Of course, trusting the government with your privacy is like having a
Peeping Tom install your window blinds. And, since the folks I've met in
this White House seem like extremely smart, conscious freedom-lovers -
hell, a lot of them are Deadheads -  I was sure that after they were fully
moved in, they'd face down the National Security Agency and the FBI, let
Clipper die a natural death, and lower the export embargo on reliable
encryption products. <p>

Furthermore, the National Institutes of Standards and Technology and the
National Security Council have been studying both Clipper and export
embargoes since April. Given that the volumes of expert testimony they had
collected overwhelmingly opposed  both, I expected the final report would
give the administration all the support it needed to do the right thing. <p>

I was wrong. Instead, there would be no report. Apparently, they couldn't
draft one that supported, on the evidence, what they had decided to do
instead. <p>

THE OTHER SHOE DROPS <p>

On Friday, February 4, the other jackboot dropped. A series of
announcements from the administration made it clear that cryptography would
become their very own "Bosnia of telecommunications" (as one staffer put
it). It wasn't just that the old  Serbs in the National Security Agency and
the FBI were still making the calls. The alarming new reality was that the
invertebrates in the White House were only too happy to abide by them.
Anything to avoid appearing soft on drugs or terrorism. <p>

So, rather than ditching Clipper, they declared it a Federal Data
Processing Standard, backing that up with an immediate government order for
50,000 Clipper devices. They appointed the National Institutes of Standards
and Technology and the  Department of Treasury as the "trusted" third
parties that would hold the Clipper key pairs. (Treasury, by the way, is
also home to such trustworthy agencies as the Secret Service and the Bureau
of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.) <p>

They reaffirmed the export embargo on robust encryption products, admitting
for the first time that its purpose was to stifle competition to Clipper.
And they outlined a very porous set of requirements under which the cops
might get the keys to your  chip. (They would not go into the procedure by
which the National Security Agency could get them, though they assured us
it was sufficient.) <p>

They even signaled the impending return of the dread Digital Telephony, an
FBI legislative initiative requiring fundamental reengineering of the
information infrastructure; providing wiretapping ability to the FBI would
then become the paramount  design priority. <p>

INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS <p>

Actually, by the time the announcements thudded down, I wasn't surprised by
them. I had spent several days the previous week in and around the White
House. <p>

I felt like I was in another remake of The Invasion of the Body Snatchers.
My friends in the administration had been transformed. They'd been subsumed
by the vast mindfield on the other side of the security clearance membrane,
where dwell the  monstrous bureaucratic organisms that feed on fear. They'd
been infected by the institutionally paranoid National Security Agency's
Weltanschauung. <p>

They used all the telltale phrases. Mike Nelson, the White House point man
on the NII, told me, "If only I could tell you what I know, you'd feel the
same way I do." I told him I'd been inoculated against that argument during
Vietnam. (And it does  seem to me that if you're going to initiate a
process that might end freedom in America, you probably need an argument
that isn't classified.) <p>

Besides, how does he know what he knows? Where does he get his information?
Why, the National Security Agency, of course. Which, given its strong
interest in the outcome, seems hardly an unimpeachable source. <p>

However they reached it, Clinton and Gore have an astonishingly simple
bottom line, to which even the future of American liberty and prosperity is
secondary: They believe that it is their responsibility to eliminate, by
whatever means, the  possibility that some terrorist might get a nuke and
use it on, say, the World Trade Center. They have been convinced that such
plots are more likely to ripen to hideous fruition behind a shield of
encryption. <p>

The staffers I talked to were unmoved by the argument that anyone smart
enough to steal a nuclear device is probably smart enough to use PGP or
some other uncompromised crypto standard. And never mind that the last
people who popped a hooter in the  World Trade Center were able to get it
there without using any cryptography and while under FBI surveillance. <p>

We are dealing with religion here. Though only ten American lives have been
lost to terrorism in the last two years, the primacy of this threat has
become as much an article of faith with these guys as the Catholic
conviction that human life begins  at conception or the Mormon belief that
the Lost Tribe of Israel crossed the Atlantic in submarines. <p>

In the spirit of openness and compromise, they invited the Electronic
Frontier Foundation to submit other solutions to the "problem" of the
nuclear-enabled terrorist than key escrow devices, but they would not admit
into discussion the argument that  such a threat might, in fact, be some
kind of phantasm created by the spooks to ensure their lavish budgets into
the post-Cold War era. <p>

As to the possibility that good old-fashioned investigative techniques
might be more valuable in preventing their show-case catastrophe (as it was
after the fact in finding the alleged perpetrators of the last attack on
the World Trade Center), they  just hunkered down and said that when
wiretaps were necessary, they were damned well necessary. <p>

When I asked about the business that American companies lose because of
their inability to export good encryption products, one staffer essentially
dismissed the market, saying that total world trade in crypto goods was
still less than a billion  dollars. (Well, right. Thanks more to the
diligent efforts of the National Security Agency than to dim sales
potential.) <p>

I suggested that a more immediate and costly real-world effect of their
policies would be to reduce national security by isolating American
commerce, owing to a lack of international confidence in the security of
our data lines. I said that Bruce  Sterling's fictional data-enclaves in
places like the Turks and Caicos Islands were starting to look real-world
inevitable. <p>

They had a couple of answers to this, one unsatisfying and the other scary.
The unsatisfying answer was that the international banking community could
just go on using DES, which still seemed robust enough to them. (DES is the
old federal Data  Encryption Standard, thought by most cryptologists to be
nearing the end of its credibility.) <p>

More frightening was their willingness to counter the data-enclave future
with one in which no data channels anywhere would be secure from
examination by one government or another. Pointing to unnamed other
countries that were developing their own  mandatory standards and
restrictions regarding cryptography, they said words to the effect of,
"Hey, it's not like you can't outlaw the stuff. Look at France." <p>

Of course, they have also said repeatedly - and for now I believe them -
that they have absolutely no plans to outlaw non-Clipper crypto in the US.
But that doesn't mean that such plans wouldn't develop in the presence of
some pending "emergency."  Then there is that White House briefing
document, issued at the time Clipper was first announced, which asserts
that no US citizen "as a matter of right, is entitled to an unbreakable
commercial encryption product." <p>

Now why, if it's an ability they have no intention of contesting, do they
feel compelled to declare that it's not a right? Could it be that they are
preparing us for the laws they'll pass after some bearded fanatic has
gotten himself a surplus nuke  and used something besides Clipper to
conceal his plans for it? <p>

If they are thinking about such an eventuality, we should be doing so as
well. How will we respond? I believe there is a strong, though currently
untested, argument that outlawing unregulated crypto would violate the
First Amendment, which surely  protects the manner of our speech as clearly
as it protects the content. <p>

But of course the First Amendment is, like the rest of the Constitution,
only as good as the government's willingness to uphold it. And they are, as
I say, in the mood to protect our safety over our liberty. <p>

This is not a mind-frame against which any argument is going to be very
effective. And it appeared that they had already heard and rejected every
argument I could possibly offer. <p>

In fact, when I drew what I thought was an original comparison between
their stand against naturally proliferating crypto and the folly of King
Canute (who placed his throne on the beach and commanded the tide to leave
him dry), my government  opposition looked pained and said he had heard
that one almost as often as jokes about roadkill on the information
superhighway. <p>

I hate to go to war with them. War is always nastier among friends.
Furthermore, unless they've decided to let the National Security Agency
design the rest of the National Information Infrastructure as well, we need
to go on working closely with  them on the whole range of issues like
access, competition, workplace privacy, common carriage, intellectual
property, and such. Besides, the proliferation of strong crypto will
probably happen eventually no matter what they do. <p>

But then again, it might not. In which case we could shortly find ourselves
under a government that would have the automated ability to log the time,
origin and recipient of every call we made, could track our physical
whereabouts continuously,  could keep better account of our financial
transactions than we do, and all without a warrant. Talk about crime
prevention! <p>

Worse, under some vaguely defined and surely mutable "legal authority,"
they also would be able to listen to our calls and read our e-mail without
having to do any backyard rewiring. They wouldn't need any permission at
all to monitor overseas calls. <p>

If there's going to be a fight, I'd rather it be with this government than
the one we'd likely face on that hard day. <p>

Hey, I've never been a paranoid before. It's always seemed to me that most
governments are too incompetent to keep a good plot strung together all the
way from coffee break to quitting time. But I am now very nervous about the
government of the  United States of America. <p>

Because Bill 'n' Al, whatever their other new-paradigm virtues, have
allowed the very old-paradigm trogs of the Guardian Class to define as
their highest duty the defense of America against an enemy that exists
primarily in the imagination - and is  therefore capable of anything. <p>

To assure absolute safety against such an enemy, there is no limit to the
liberties we will eventually be asked to sacrifice. And, with a Clipper
Chip in every phone, there will certainly be no technical limit on their
ability to enforce those  sacrifices. <p>

WHAT YOU CAN DO <p>

GET CONGRESS TO LIFT THE CRYPTO EMBARGO <p>

The administration is trying to impose Clipper on us by manipulating market
forces. By purchasing massive numbers of Clipper devices, they intend to
induce an economy of scale which will make them cheap while the export
embargo renders all  competition either expensive or nonexistent. <p>

We have to use the market to fight back. While it's unlikely that they'll
back down on Clipper deployment, the Electronic Frontier Foundation
believes that with sufficient public involvement, we can get Congress to
eliminate the export embargo. <p>

Rep. Maria Cantwell, D-Washington, has a bill (H.R. 3627) before the
Economic Policy, Trade, and Environment Subcommittee of the House Committee
on Foreign Affairs that would do exactly that. She will need a lot of help
from the public. They may not  care much about your privacy in DC, but they
still care about your vote. <p>

Please signal your support of H.R. 3627, either by writing her directly or
e-mailing her at cantwell@eff.org. Messages sent to that address will be
printed out and delivered to her office. In the subject header of your
message, please include the  words "support HR 3627." In the body of your
message, express your reasons for supporting the bill. You may also express
your sentiments to Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Indiana, the House Committee on
Foreign Affairs chair, by e-mailing hamilton@eff.org. <p>

Furthermore, since there is nothing quite as powerful as a letter from a
constituent, you should check the following list of subcommittee and
committee members to see if your congressional representative is among
them. If so, please copy them your  letter to Rep. Cantwell. <p>

&gt; Economic Policy, Trade, and Environment Subcommittee: <p>

Democrats: Sam Gejdenson (Chair), D-Connecticut; James Oberstar, D-
Minnesota; Cynthia McKinney, D-Georgia; Maria Cantwell, D-Washington; Eric
Fingerhut, D-Ohio; Albert R. Wynn, D-Maryland; Harry Johnston, D-Florida;
Eliot Engel, D-New York; Charles Schumer, D-New York. <p>

Republicans: Toby Roth (ranking), R-Wisconsin; Donald Manzullo, R-Illinois;
Doug Bereuter, R-Nebraska; Jan Meyers, R-Kansas; Cass Ballenger, R-North
Carolina; Dana Rohrabacher, R-California. <p>

Gallegly, R-California; Ileana  Ros-Lehtinen, R-Florida; David Levy, R-New
York; Lincoln Diaz-Balart, R-Florida; Ed Royce, R-California. <p>

BOYCOTT CLIPPER DEVICES AND THE COMPANIES WHICH MAKE THEM. <p>

Don't buy anything with a Clipper Chip in it. Don't buy any product from a
company that manufactures devices with Big Brother inside. It is likely
that the government will ask you to use Clipper for communications with the
IRS or when doing business  with federal agencies. They cannot, as yet,
require you to do so. Just say no. <p>

LEARN ABOUT ENCRYPTION AND EXPLAIN THE ISSUES TO YOUR UNWIRED FRIENDS <p>

The administration is banking on the likelihood that this stuff is too
technically obscure to agitate anyone but nerds like us. Prove them wrong
by patiently explaining what's going on to all the people you know who have
never touched a computer and  glaze over at the mention of words like
"cryptography." <p>

Maybe you glaze over yourself. Don't. It's not that hard. For some hands-on
experience, download a copy of PGP - Pretty Good Privacy - a shareware
encryption engine which uses the robust RSA encryption algorithm. And learn
to use it. <p>

GET YOUR COMPANY TO THINK ABOUT EMBEDDING REAL CRYPTOGRAPHY IN ITS PRODUCTS <p>

If you work for a company that makes software, computer hardware, or any
kind of communications device, work from within to get them to incorporate
RSA or some other strong encryption scheme into their products. If they say
that they are afraid to  violate the export embargo, ask them to consider
manufacturing such products overseas and importing them back into the
United States. There appears to be no law against that. Yet. <p>

You might also lobby your company to join the Digital Privacy and Security
Working Group, a coalition of companies and public interest groups -
including IBM, Apple, Sun, Microsoft, and, interestingly, Clipper phone
manufacturer AT&amp;T - that is  working to get the embargo lifted. <p>

ENLIST! <p>

Self-serving as it sounds coming from me, you can do a lot to help by
becoming a member of one of these organizations. In addition to giving you
access to the latest information on this subject, every additional member
strengthens our credibility  with Congress. <p>

&gt; Join the Electronic Frontier Foundation by writing membership@eff.org. <p>

&gt; Join Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility by e-mailing
cpsr.info@cpsr <p>

.org. CPSR is also organizing a protest, to which you can lend your support
by sending e-mail to clipper.petition@cpsr.org with "I oppose Clipper" in
the message body. Ftp/gopher/WAIS to cpsr.org /cpsr/privacy/ <p>

crypto/clipper for more info. <p>

In his LA speech, Gore called the development of the NII "a revolution."
And it is a revolutionary war we are engaged in here. Clipper is a last
ditch attempt by the United States, the last great power from the old
Industrial Era, to establish  imperial control over cyberspace. If they
win, the most liberating development in the history of humankind could
become, instead, the surveillance system which will monitor our
grandchildren's morality. We can be better ancestors than that. <p>

Subject: Electronic Privacy -- A Call to Action <p>

This is a pivotal moment in history. <p>

The national security state, with the backing of the Clinton-Gore
administration, is attempting a stealth strike on our rights. If they
succeed, we could shortly find ourselves under a government with the
automated ability to log the time, origin, and recipient of every call and
e-mail message, to monitor our most private communications, to track our
physical whereabouts continuously, and to keep better account of our
financial transactions than we do -- all without a warrant. <p>

Fact: On Friday, February 4, 1994, the Clinton administration announced
support for the Clipper Chip and SKIPJACK encryption scheme as national
standards. <p>

Fact: Federal security agencies have been meeting with telecommunications
companies to design back doors into the entire National Information
Infrastructure (NII), including every telephone and data network, even
including fax machines. In other words, any system connected to the NII
would be required to include a "back door" in order to facilitate
monitoring by government agencies. <p>

We at WIRED Online believe that the adoption of these administration
initiatives could result in a profound infringement of individual freedom
and privacy, ours as well as yours. We urge you to read the rest of this
letter, to examine the available materials, to consider these important
issues for yourself, and to act to preserve the Bill of Rights in
cyberspace. <p>

The proposed encryption scheme, which uses the SKIPJACK encryption
algorithm and the Clipper Chip, relies on a "key escrow" system with a
built-in "back door" so that security agents can decrypt and monitor even
supposedly "secure" communications. While the administration claims that
there will be "safeguards," the technology was developed by the virtually
insular National Security Agency, and its algorithms remain classified. <p>

The scope of Clipper is significantly broader than any previous
surveillance strategy. The Clipper Chip will be installed directly into
telecommunications devices such as telephones, computers, and digital set-
top boxes for interactive TV. Since the system can be used to encrypt any
communications that pass across telecommunications lines (including text,
sound and images), ANY AND ALL communication that passes through your
system has the possibility of being intercepted. <p>

In addition, the administration's Information Infrastructure Task Force
Working Group on Privacy is attempting to "front load" the NII with
trapdoor technologies that would allow security agencies easy access to
digitial conversations, including capturing electronic communications
midstream. No communication system would be exempt from this effort, from
the national telephone network to your local office computer network. <p>

Of course, the administration claims that these trapdoors will be used only
to catch criminals and that your privacy will be protected. But, as John
Perry Barlow has put it, "trusting the government with your privacy is like
trusting a Peeping Tom to install your window blinds." <p>

These government inititatives, taken together, constitute one of the most
grievous threats to our constitutional liberties in modern times. The
security agencies and the administration are involved in a stealth strike
at our freedoms that could effectively abrogate the Bill of Rights in
cyberspace, where we and our descendants will be spending increasingly
larger parts of lives. <p>

The Clipper initiative and the plans to require "back doors" throughout the
NII immediate critical assessment. WIRED encourages you to seriously
consider how these proposals might affect you. To help inform your
decision, WIRED Online has set up a Clipper information archive through our
Infobot mail server, Internet Gopher, World Wide Web, and other online
sites. <p>

The WIRED Online Clipper Archive features crucial essays written for WIRED
by John Perry Barlow and Brock N. Meeks. If you do nothing else, read these
stories. You can have them sent to you immediately by electronic mail by
copying the following three lines into the body of an electronic mail
message addressed to infobot@wired.com: <p>

send clipper/privacy.meeks
   send clipper/privacy.barlow
   end <p>

The WIRED Online Clipper Archive also includes re-posted comments from
Jerry Berman (of the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)) and Dorothy
Denning (encryption expert and Clipper proponent), a copy of the EFF's
_EFFector Online_ newsletter documenting the Clipper controversy, and an
electronic anti-Clipper petition circulated by the Computer Professionals
for Social Responsibility (CPSR). We have also set up links to other
valuable sources of information on Clipper, including those maintained by
the EFF and CPSR. <p>

You can access our archive via the following WIRED Online services: <p>

EFF WANTS YOU - TO CALL FOR SENATE HEARINGS ON CLIPPER! <p>

*** Distribute Widely *** <p>

Dear Friends on the Electronic Frontier, <p>

Thank you for your efforts in fighting the government's ill-considered
Clipper proposal. We have already delivered over 2250 messages supporting
H.R. 3627 to Rep. Cantwell, and your messages have continued to flood in.
We'd now like to ask you to help us call for Congressional hearings on
Clipper by writing to Senator Patrick Leahy c/o leahy@eff.org. <p>

As we have previously reported, the Clinton Administration has announced
that it plans to proceed on every front to make the Clipper Chip
encryption scheme a national standard and to discourage the development
and sale of alternative powerful encryption technologies. If the
government succeeds in this effort, the resulting blow to individual
freedom and privacy could be immeasurable. <p>

So far, the government has resisted requests that it explain its policy.
When the Presidential Decision Directive calling for Clipper deployment
first appeared last spring, the Administration promised a report that
re-evaluated cryptography and privacy policy in light of technological
changes, the coming of the National Information Infrastructure, and the
end of the Cold War. The Administration also made a commitment to
meaningful public dialog before taking any major action on escrow
deployment or new legislation. <p>

Yet in spite of the efforts of EFF, CPSR, ACLU, and other groups to
provide extensive input to the Administration, the promised policy report
never arrived, and the Administration has now said there will be no report
after all. This failure of public accountability makes Congressional
hearings an absolute necessity. <p>

There are individuals in Congress willing to look into the Clipper
proposal and related policies--if they hear from you. Senator Patrick
Leahy (D-Vermont), who chairs one of the key committees responsible for
these issues, has asked for comments and concerns about the viability of
the Clipper initiative. <p>

Here's where we need your help. *Please write Senator Leahy at <p>

leahy@eff.org <p>

and ask that the Senate hold hearings about Clipper.* Senate hearings may
be the only means of ensuring public feedback about Clipper, and, just as
important, they may be the only means of forcing the Administration to
explain its Clipper policy. Please express your concerns about the United
States' Clipper policy and cryptographic policy in general. Your letters
in support of hearings will be printed out and delivered to the senator. <p>

And if you haven't written Rep. Maria Cantwell to show your support for
H.R. 3627, her bill to relax export restrictions on encryption technology,
now's the time to do so. Just send e-mail to <p>

cantwell@eff.org <p>

and put "I support H.R. 3627" in your Subject header. Letters in support
of the bill will be printed out and delivered to Rep. Cantwell. <p>

Our fight to keep national encryption policy out in the open--and to
continue allowing individuals to use encryption to ensure their own
privacy--has only just begun. In the coming weeks and months, we will be
working to give you more ways to make your voice heard on these vital
public issues. <p>

Sincerely, <p>

Jerry Berman
Executive Director
Electronic Frontier Foundation <p>

Just to keep people up to date... Blacknet, the official word <p>

From: tcmay@netcom.com (Timothy C. May)
Subject: Re: Blacknet worries
To: cypherpunks@toad.com

Hal Finney makes some comments about the dangers (I call them benefits) of
systems like "BlackNet," the hypothetical-but-inevitable entity I described
last fall. These dangers/benefits have been apparent to me since around 1988
or so and are the main motivator of my interest in "crypto-anarchy," the set
of ideas that I espouse. <p>

(I don't often dwell on them on this list, partly because I already have in
the past, and in the "Crypto-Anarchist Manifesto" and other rants at the
soda.berkeley.edu archive site, and partly because the Cypherpunks list is
somewhat apolitical...apolitical in the sense that we have libertarians,
anarcho-syndicalists, anarcho-capitalists, Neo-Pagans, Christian
Fundamentalists, and maybe even a few unreconstructed Communists on the
List, and espousing some particular set of beliefs is discouraged by common
agreement.) <p>

However, since Hal has raised some issues, and the general issues of data
havens, anonymous information markets, espionage, and other "illegal"
markets have been raised, I'll comment. Besides, volume on the List has been
awfully light the past few days. Maybe it's my mail delivery system slowing
down, maybe it's the Olymics (I say put Tonya up on the gold medalist's
platform, put the gold medal around her neck, then the noose, then kick the
platform out from under her), or maybe it's the natural exhaustion of the
last set of hot topics. <p>

First, a legal caveat. I openly acknowledge having written the BlackNet
piece--proof is obvious. But I did *not* post it to Cypherpunks, nor to any
other mailing lists and certainly not to Usenet. Rather, I dashed it off one
night prior to a nanotechnology discussion in Palo Alto, as a concrete
example of the coming future and how difficult it will be to "bottle up" new
technologies (a point Hal alludes to). I sent this note off to several of my
associates, via anonymous remailers, so as to make the point in a more
tangible way. I also printed out copies and passed them out at the nanotech
meeting, which was around last September or so. <p>

Someone decided to post this (through a remailer) to the Cypherpunks list.
Kevin Kelly and John Markoff told me they've seen it on numerous other lists
and boards, and of course Detweiler has recently posted it to dozens of
newsgroups (though it got cancelled and only the "echoes" remain in most
places...a few folks forwarded copies to ohter sites, with comments, so they
were not affected by the cancellation message). <p>

My legal protection, my point here, is that I did not post the BlackNet
piece, it does not exist as an actual espionage or data haven entity, and my
point was rhetorical and is clearly protected by the First Amendment (to the
Constitution of the country in which I nominally reside). <p>

On to Hal Finney's points:
&gt; Tim's Blacknet story has gotten a lot of reaction after Detweiler's
&gt; random posting escapade last week.  I think it is a good essay, but there
&gt; is one point I don't think was stressed enough.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; BlackNet is currently building its information inventory. We are interested
&gt; &gt; in information in the following areas, though any other juicy stuff is
&gt; &gt; always welcome. "If you think it's valuable, offer it to us first."
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; - trade secrets, processes, production methods (esp. in semiconductors)
&gt; &gt; - nanotechnology and related techniques (esp. the Merkle sleeve bearing)
...
&gt; The glaring omision, mentioned only in passing, is military intelligence. <p>

Yes, military intelligence will become much more "fungible" in the future I
envision. It already is, of course, a la the Walkers, but computer-mediated
markets and secure encryption will make it so much more efficient and
liquid. Buyers will be able to advertise their wants and their prices. Ditto
for sellers. Of course, decoys, disinformation, and the like come to the
fore. <p>

To pick a trivial example, someone sits above a busy port and watches ship
movements from the privacy of his apartment. He summarizes these, then sells
them for a paltry-but-comfortable $3000 a month to some other nation. (The
ease of doing this means others will get into the market. Prices will likely
drop. Hard to predict the final prices...the beauty of free markets.) <p>

&gt; A friend at work tells me that in the Manhattan project, presumably one
&gt; of the most secret projects ever attempted, the Soviet Union had no <p>

Yes, Hal's point is valid. William Gibson, so reviled in some cyberpunk
quarters (it's tres chic to bash him) anticipated this some years back in
"Count Zero," in which the scientists of a company are held isolated on a
mesa in New Mexico--recall the rescue/escape by ultralight aircraft off the
mesa? <p>

The motivation for thinking about BlackNet, which is what I dubbed this
capability in late 1987, was a discussion with the late Phil Salin that year
about his as-yet-unfunded company, "AMIX," the American Information
Exchange. I played the Devil's Advocate and explained why I thought
corporate America--his main target for customers--would shun such a system.
My thinking? <p>

- corporations would not allow employees to have corporate accounts, as it
would make leakage of corporate information too easy <p>

(Example: "We will pay $100,000 for anyone who knows how to solve the charge
buildup problem during ion implant of n-type wafers." Many corporations
spend millions to solve this, others never did. A "market" for such
simple-to-answer items would revolutionize the semiconductor industry--but
would also destroy the competitive advantage obtained by those who first
solved the problems. Another example, from earlier on, is the alpha particle
problem plaguing memory chips. I figured out the problem and the solution in
1977, at Intel, and then Intel kept it a deep secret for the next year,
allowing its competitors to wallow in their soft error problems for that
entire year. When I was eventually allowed to publish--a decision made for
various reasons--the competitors raced for the telephones even before I'd
finished presenting my paper! Imagine how much I could've sold my
"expertise" for in the preceding year--or even after.  Of course, Intel
could have deduced who was selling what, by various intelligence-
counterintelligence ploys familiar to most of you (canary traps, barium,
tagged info). But the point is still clear: an information market system
like AMIX means "digital moonlighting," a system corporations will not
lightly put up with. <p>

If information markets spread, even "legit" ones like AMIX (not featuring
anonymity), I expect many corporations to make non-participation in such
markets a basis for continuing employment.  (The details of this, the legal
issues, I'll leave for later discussions.) <p>

&gt; Keeping business secrets and manufacturing techniques secret is one thing.
&gt; But, from the point of view of the government, the world of Blacknet could
&gt; be an utter disaster for the protection of military secrets.  Despite its
&gt; consumption of a large fraction of our society's resources, government jobs
&gt; tend not to be high paying, especially compared to jobs with comparable
&gt; degrees of responsibility in civilian life.  The temptation to sell secrets
&gt; for cash has got to be present for almost everyone.  But it is balanced against
&gt; the immense practical problems involved: making contacts, arranging
&gt; deliveries, being caught in a "sting" operation. <p>

Yes, which is why I always used to use "B-2 Stealth Bomber blueprints for
sale" as my canonical example of a BlackNet ad. Hundreds of folks at
Northrup had access to various levels of B-2 secrets. The "problem" for them
was that military intelligence (Defense Intelligence Agency, Office of Naval
Intelligence, CIA, NDA, etc.) was watching them (and they knew this) and
monitoring the local bars and after-work hangouts.  Read "The Falcon and the
Snowman," or rent the movie, for some details on this. <p>

Anonymous markets completely change the equation! <p>

(By the way, many other "tradecraft" aspects of espionage are similarly
changed forever....and probably already have been changed.  Gone will be the
messages left in Coke cans by the side of the road, the so-called "dead
drops" so favored by spies for communicating microfilm, microdots, and coded
messages. What I call "digital dead drops" already allow nearly untraceable,
unrestricted communication.  After all, if I can use a remailer to reach St.
Petersburg.... Or if I can place message bits in the LSB of a image and then
place this on Usenet for world-wide distribution..... (I described this in
my first message on using LSBs of audio and picture files in 1988, in
sci.crypt). The world has already changed for the spy. And Mafia guys on the
run are using CompuServe to communicate with their wives...the Feds can't
tap these ever-changing systems....a likely motivation for current
Clipper/Capstone/Tessera/Digital Telephony schemes.) <p>

&gt; Blacknet could remove most of this risk.  With near-perfect anonymity
&gt; and digital cash, a tidy side income could be created for anyone with access
&gt; to classified information.  There would be no need for risky physical meetings.
&gt; The money could be spent on a few nice extras to make life more comfortable,
&gt; without fear of it being traced. <p>

Yep! That's the beauty of it all. "Classified classifieds," so to speak. "No
More Secrets." At least, no more secrets that you don't keep yourself! (A
subtle point: crypto-anarchy doesn't mean a "no secrets" society; it means a
society in which individuals must protect their own secrets and not count on
governments or corporations to do it for them. It also means "public
secrets," like troop movements and Stealth production plans, or the tricks
of implaniting wafers, will not remain secret for long.) <p>

&gt; How many people would succumb to such temptation?  People do undergo security
&gt; checks, and presumably those who pass are mostly honest.  But they are human,
&gt; and money is a powerful motivator.  Especially if the person figures that if
&gt; he doesn't sell the info someone else will, the temptation will be all the
&gt; stronger. <p>

Yes. All of this is true. <p>

&gt; There are possible countermeasures: frequent lie-detector tests (as in Snow
&gt; Crash); "fingerprinting" documents so everybody has a slightly different
&gt; copy, allowing sting operations to identify the culprits; perhaps even
&gt; swamping the legitimate offers of cash with bogus ones (a denial-of-service
&gt; attack, in effect).  But none of these are really likely to solve the
&gt; problem. <p>

We went around several times on the Extropians list (which I am no longer
on, by the way--for unrelated reasons), especially with regard to what most
folks consider an even more disturbing use of BlackNet-type services: liquid
markets for killings and extortion. Pun intended. Buyers and sellers of
"hits" can get in contact anonymously, place money (digicash) in escrow with
"reputable escrow services" ("Ace's Anonymous Escrow--You slay 'em, we pay
'em"), and the usual methods of stopping such hits fail. <p>

(The Mob rarely is stopped, as they use their own hitters, usually brought
if from distant cities for just the one job. And reputations are paramount.
Amateurs usually are caught because they get in contact with potential
hitters by "asking around" in bars and the like...and somebody calls the
cops and the FBI then stings 'em.  Anonymous markets, digital cash, escrow
services, and reputation services all change the equation dramatically. If
the hit is made, the money get transferred. If the hit is not made, no money
is transferred. In any case, the purchaser of the hit is fairly safe.
Implication of the purchaser can still happen, but by means other than the
usual approach of setting up a sting.) <p>

&gt; This is probably the issue which has the government really scared, the
&gt; issue which turned Barlow's government friends against free encryption, as
&gt; he describes in his Wired article ("if you knew what I know, you'd oppose
&gt; it too").  The NSA in particular has for a long time been wildly paranoid <p>

Yes, if I could think all this stuff up in 1987-8, so can a lot of others.
It was clear to me, at the Crypo Conference in 1988, that David Chaum had
thought of these uses and was deliberately navigating around them in his
scenarios for digicash. He just raised his eyebrows and nodded when I
discussed a few of the less fearsome applications. <p>

&gt; its own secrets than discovering others'.  I could see any technology which
&gt; would facilitate sellouts by their people to be considered a mortal threat,
&gt; something to be fought by any means.  And I imagine that the rest of the
&gt; military intelligence community would feel the same way. <p>

To the governments of the world, facing these and other threats to their
continued ways of doing business (notice that I didn't say "to their
continued existence"), the existence of strong encryption in the hands of
the population is indeed a mortal threat. <p>

They'll cite the "unpopular" uses: kiddie porn nets, espionage, selling of
trade secrets (especially to "foreigners"), the bootlegging of copyrighted
material, "digital fences" for stolen information, liquid markets in
liquidations, and on and on. They won't mention a basic principle of western
civilization: that just because _some_ people mis-use a technology that is
no reason to bar others. <p>

Just because some people mis-use camcorders to film naked children is no
reason to ban cameras, camcorders, and VCRs. Just because some folks mis-use
free speech is no reason to ban free speech. And just because some will
mis-use encryption--in the eyes of government--is not a good reason to ban
encryption. <p>

In any case, it's too late. The genie's nearly completely out of the bottle.
National borders are just speed bumps on the information highway. <p>

The things I've had in my .sig for the past couple of years are coming. <p>

Ladder-DES: A Proposed Candidate to Replace DES <p>

Terry Ritter
                         February 22, 1994 <p>

Introduction <p>

Data enciphered by DES, the US Data Encryption Standard, has become
 vulnerable to modern technical attacks.  Currently, such attacks
 require substantial capital and high-tech engineering development
 to produce a special "DES breaking" machine.  However, once such a
 machine is built, attacks would become relatively fast and cheap.
 Businesses which currently protect very expensive and marketable
 secrets with DES should take immediate notice. <p>

To maintain earlier levels of security, DES must be replaced with
 a stronger cipher.  The one obvious alternative to DES is a simple
 construct built from DES called triple-DES.  Triple-DES, while
 generally being thought of as "strong enough," also carries the
 baggage of requiring three times the processing of normal DES. <p>

Because every security system is required to provide more benefit
 than its cost, raising costs by a factor of three (when compared
 to the alternative of normal DES) is a significant issue.  Such
 costs could dangerously delay the retirement of ordinary DES. <p>

Requirements <p>

The goal of this sequence of designs is to identify one or more
 better candidates to replace DES.  Obviously, the first requirement
 is that each candidate be substantially "stronger" than normal DES.
 One problem here is that we can only _argue_ strength, so it is
 important that candidate designs be openly presented and reviewed.
 We cannot expect that most proposals will withstand such review. <p>

The second requirement is that each candidate design also be faster
 than triple-DES; otherwise, we might just as well use triple-DES
 and be done with it.  Speed is a measurable design quantity. <p>

My third requirement is to include operation on data blocks larger
 than the 8-byte DES block.  Although DES is not normally used in a
 way which is conducive to "dictionary" attack, such attacks could be
 effective on the bare cipher itself.  This raises the possibility
 that a "certificational" weakness may exist which we currently do
 not know how to exploit, but which may be dangerous anyway.  This
 particular weakness depends upon small blocks. <p>

At this point there is still some question as to whether it is
 _possible_ to come up with candidate designs which meet these
 three requirements. <p>

Ladder Diagrams <p>

DES itself is frequently shown in figures which are described as
 "ladder diagrams" because of their appearance: <p>

|
                    v
           Initial Permutation
                    v
              &lt;-- SPLIT --&gt;
             |             |
             |      k1     |
             v      v      |
            XOR &lt;-- f -----|
             |             |
             |      k2     |
             |      v      v
             |----- f --&gt; XOR
             |             |
                  . . . <p>

|      k16    |
             |      v      v
             |----- f --&gt; XOR
             |             |
             |             |
             --&gt; COLLECT &lt;--
                    v
             Inv. Init. Perm.
                    |
                    v <p>

This is the data-transformation part of DES.  Not shown is the
 key-schedule computation which produces k1 through k16, the 48-bit
 "round" keys.  Also not shown is the construction of function "f." <p>

It will later be interesting to note that in DES each 32-bit data
 rail value is expanded to 48 bits, the XOR occurs with a 48-bit key,
 and the result contracted to 32 bits in 6-bit to 4-bit substitutions
 known as "S-boxes." <p>

Ladder-DES <p>

Consider this simple construct which looks something like two
 rungs or steps on a ladder: <p>

A              B
             |      k1      |
             v      v       |
            XOR &lt;- DES1 ----|
             |              |
             |      k2      |
             |      v       v
             |---- DES2 -&gt; XOR
             |              |
             v              v
             C              D <p>

A, B, C and D represent 8-byte blocks; k1 and k2 represent 56-bit
 DES keys.  This enciphers two DES data blocks in two DES operations;
 this is a data rate similar to normal DES.  It can be described as
 working on a single large block composed of A and B.  Note that the
 data paths are twice the size of those used in DES itself. <p>

Also note that the design is asymmetric:  While ciphertext block C
 is a function of every bit in plaintext blocks A and B, as well as
 every bit in key k1, ciphertext block D is _also_ a function of
 key k2. <p>

Known-Plaintext Attack on Two-Rung Ladder-DES <p>

With known-plaintext, we essentially have a single-DES complexity:
 Since A is known and C is known, the output of DES1 is known.  Since
 the input to DES1 is also known, to find k1 we just do a normal DES
 search. <p>

Alternately, since B is known and D is known, the output of DES2 is
 known.  Since the input to DES2 is also known, to find k2 we just do
 a normal DES search. <p>

Total complexity: twice DES; thus, hardly worth using. <p>

Four-Rung Ladder-DES <p>

Now consider a similar construct, twice as long: <p>

A              B
             |      k1      |
             v      v       |
            XOR &lt;- DES1-----|
             |              |
             |      k2      |
             |      v       v
             |---- DES2 -&gt; XOR
             |              |
             |      k3      |
             v      v       |
            XOR &lt;- DES3 ----|
             |              |
             |      k4      |
             |      v       v
             |---- DES4 -&gt; XOR
             |              |
             v              v
             C              D <p>

A and B are 64-bit DES blocks; k1 through k4 are 56-bit DES keys.
 A total of four DES operations process two DES blocks at double-DES
 rates.  We would expect this to be both stronger than normal DES
 and faster than triple-DES. <p>

In general, the left-leg of a ladder-DES structure is affected by
 one fewer key than the right-leg. <p>

Belief <p>

Can we "believe" in this basic structure?  Well, DES itself is
 based on it.  But we do need to remember that DES also includes
 seriously nonlinear data expansions and contractions around each
 XOR.  Certainly expansion and contraction could be added to ladder-
 DES, although this could be expensive.  (To avoid specifying
 particular S-box contents, we could specify a cryptographic RNG
 which would be used to permute a base S-box arrangement; this
 should also avoid normal differential attacks.)  It is not clear
 that the lack of expansion and contraction operations necessarily
 negates the overall approach. <p>

Key Reduction <p>

The four-rung ladder-DES construct uses four 56-bit DES keys, but
 certainly a cipher would be strong enough if it had "only" a real
 two-key (112-bit) keyspace.  Thus, we might consider making k3 = k1,
 and k4 = k2, or perhaps, k3 = k1 and k4 = k1 XOR k2. <p>

On the other hand, perhaps it would be worthwhile to support
 additional keys simply to avoid the necessity of showing that a
 reduced key approach could never reduce strength. <p>

Known-Plaintext Attack on Four-Rung Ladder-DES <p>

No longer do we have the advantage of knowing both the input to
 and the output from XOR operations, so we can no longer gain access
 to the output of particular DES operations.  Thus, the obvious
 search strategy is not available. <p>

Divide-And-Conquer Attack on Four-Rung Ladder-DES <p>

Normally we try to separate the effects of the different DES
 operations, so we can "divide and conquer" each separately.
 In this case, DES4 is the obvious first choice, since with the
 keys k1..k3 fixed, only k4 affects the output, and then it only
 affects block D.  However, unless we know the values of k1 and k2,
 we don't know the input to the bottom XOR, and so apparently
 cannot separate DES4 to work on it. <p>

Meet-In-The-Middle Attack on Four-Rung Ladder-DES <p>

With four keys involved, and no obvious "middle," it is not clear
 how this attack could be applied. <p>

2x Four-Rung Ladder-DES <p>

The basic Ladder-DES construct can be expanded to cipher four
 blocks at once: <p>

A              B         C              D
             |      k1      |         |      k2      |
             v      v       |         v      v       |
            XOR &lt;- DES1 ----|        XOR &lt;- DES2 ----|
             |              |         |              |
             |      k3      |         |      k4      |
             |      v       v         |      v       v
             |---- DES3 -&gt; XOR        |---- DES4 -&gt; XOR
             |              |         |              |
             v              v         v              v
             E              F         G              H <p>

Re-arrange Blocks <p>

H              E         F              G
             |      k5      |         |      k6      |
             v      v       |         |      v       |
            XOR &lt;- DES5 ----|        XOR &lt;- DES6 ----|
             |              |         |              |
             |      k7      |         |      k8      |
             |      v       v         |      v       v
             |---- DES7 -&gt; XOR        |---- DES8 -&gt; XOR
             |              |         |              |
             v              v         v              v
             I              J         K              L <p>

This construct enciphers four DES data blocks in eight DES
 operations; again, this is a speed comparable to double-DES, and
 substantially faster than triple-DES. <p>

Ciphertext block I is now a function of every bit in plaintext
 blocks A, B, C, and D, as well as every bit in keys k1, k2, k4,
 and k5.  Every bit in the 64-bit I is a complex function of
 480 bits. <p>

We could certainly afford to reduce the number of keys in these
 constructs, and this might be done in any number of ways.  For
 the 2x construct, for example: <p>

k2 := k1 XOR k3;  k4 := k3 XOR k5;
      k6 := k5 XOR k7;  k8 := k7 XOR k1; <p>

leaving us with a need for four keys:  k1, k3, k5 and k7.  It is
 also possible that the same two keys could be used in every two-
 rung ladder-DES section, for a total of two keys. <p>

Conclusion <p>

DES operations can be arranged into a "ladder-DES" constructs which
 are especially-clean and familiar and seem to resist known attacks.
 These constructs seem potentially stronger than normal DES and are
 demonstrably faster than triple-DES.  Thus, ladder-DES could be a
 reasonable candidate to replace DES. <p>

Another Brick in the Wall <p>

CyberWire Dispatch//Copyright (c) 1994 <p>

Jacking in from Another Brick in the Wall Port: <p>

Washington, DC -- The White House is being heavily lobbied by law
enforcement agencies and national intelligence agencies to make the use of
the government designed Clipper Chip mandatory in telephones, fax machines
and cable systems, according to classified documents obtained by Dispatch. <p>

When the Administration announced on February 4th that it was endorsing
the controversial Clipper Chip program, it asserted that any use of the
chip would be voluntary.  But the White House carefully hedged its bet:
Buried deep in the background briefing papers that accompanied the
announcement was the Administration's official policy that U.S. citizens
weren't guaranteed any constitutional right to choose their own encryption
technologies. <p>

Government officials have brushed aside concerns from civil liberties
groups and privacy advocates that sporadic adoption of Clipper would
eventually spawn a mandatory use policy.  To try and forestall that,
however, the government has instituted a subtle coercion tactic: You can't
do business with Uncle Sam unless your products are "clipper equipped,"
according to National Institute for Standards and Technology Assistant
Deputy Director Raymond Kammer. <p>

The Administration's desire for industry to sign-on as an early Clipper
"team player" was so overwhelming that it bribed AT&amp;T into agreeing to
publicly support the idea, according to classified documents obtained by
Dispatch. <p>

On the same day last April when Clipper was first unveiled, AT&amp;T publicly
proclaimed it would be installing the chip in its encryption products.  A
classified April 30, 1993 memo from the Assistant Secretary of Defense
says: "[T]he President has directed that the Attorney General request that
manufacturers of communications hardware use the trapdoor chip, and at
least AT&amp;T has been reported willing to do so (having been suitably
incentivised by promises of Government purchases)." <p>

The government says "incentivised" while prosecuting attorney's all over
the country say, "bribed."  You make the call. <p>

Take Your Privacy and Shove It
============================== <p>

That same memo says the Clipper proposal is a "complex set of issues [that]
places the public's right to privacy in opposition to the public's desire
for safety."  If "privacy prevails... criminals and spies... consequently
prosper," the memo says. <p>

What's the answer to such freeflowing privacy?  The memo says law
enforcement and national security agencies "propose that cryptography be
made available and required which contains a 'trapdoor' that would allow
law enforcement and national security officials, under proper supervision,
to decrypt enciphered communications."  The operative word here is
"required." <p>

Two Track Dialog
================ <p>

While Clinton's policy wonks wring their hands over such issues as
universal access to the National Information Infrastructure, law
enforcement and national security officials couldn't care less, frankly.
The Working Group on Privacy for the Information Infrastructure Task Force
was told in clean, cold language that the desire of law enforcement is to
"front load" the NII with "intercept technologies."  Under the guise of "do
it now or we'll catch less bad guys." <p>

It's all black or white to these guys.  Other classified Dept. of Defense
documents chime on this debate:  "This worthy goal (of building the NII) is
independent of arguments as to whether or not law enforcement and national
security officials will be able to read at will traffic passing along the
information superhighway." <p>

This is not science fiction.  The Clipper chip is like a cancer that has
eaten into the fabric of all levels of government, including the military.
Classified DoD documents state that a "full-scale public debate is needed
to ascertain the wishes of U.S. citizens with regard to their privacy, and
the impact on public safety of preserving privacy at the expense of
wiretapping and communications intercept capabilities of law enforcement
and national security personnel." <p>

In other words, they don't think you know what you want.  To them, it's a
kind of tradeoff, a twisted sort of privacy auction.  What do you bid?
Your privacy for two drug lords, a former KGB spy and a pedophile.  What's
the price?  Your government wants to know. Honest. <p>

The jury's still out, according to these classified documents: "It is not
clear what the public will decide." <p>

But you can rest safely, the Pentagon does.  Why?  Again from a secret
memo:  "In the meantime, DoD has trapdoor technology and the Government is
proceeding with development of the processes needed to apply that
technology in order to maintain the capability to perform licit intercept
of communications in support of law enforcement and national security." <p>

Meeks out... <p>

 Emotion vs. Reason in the Clipper "Debate" <p>

Date:    Sun, 20 Feb 94 12:57 PST
From:    lauren@vortex.com (Lauren Weinstein; PRIVACY Forum Moderator)
Subject: Emotion vs. Reason in the Clipper "Debate" <p>

Greetings.  The PRIVACY Forum submission box is piled high with Clipper
related messages.  I will not be distributing most of them.  The level of
discourse demonstrated in some of the submissions I've received is
shockingly low--replete with ad hominem attacks and emotionally potent but
logically deprived arguments.  The "debate" over Clipper is threatening to
be pulled straight into the sewer.  This is clearly not an encouraging
development.  The issues of Clipper and related topics are too important to
be dragged down to such a low level. <p>

Other activities regarding this debate are also of concern.  As you may
know, CPSR (Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility) has been
sponsoring an e-mail anti-Clipper petition drive.  EFF (Electronic Frontier
Foundation) is sponsoring a similar e-mail based drive to pressure for U.S.
Congressional hearings regarding Clipper. <p>

While many of the goals of both organizations are often laudable, I am not
convinced that such "petition" techniques are appropriate to the
circumstances at hand.  The ease of sending e-mail means that it would
probably be possible to get 10's of 1000's of quickie "add my name to the
list" messages to such automated petition servers for virtually *any*
topic.  People don't have to understand, think about, or even have really
heard about a subject, they just shoot an empty message off to an address and
add their userid to the list.  Even if we assume that there isn't much
fraud from persons sending in multiple messages under differing names
(certainly possible and simple on many systems) what does such quickie
knee-jerk response mechanisms provide to enhance the debate? <p>

CPSR has been comparing the response to their current drive to the similar
effort conducted against "Lotus Marketplace" sometime back.  One could argue
that the techniques used to convince a private firm not to market a
particular niche information product (and of course, all the related
information is still widely available!) is not necessarily applicable to
arguing against a major cryptographic system with strong government backing
and apparently not inconsiderable bipartisan support (at least outside of the
"technical" community).  CPSR has also recently been "promoting" a "Big
Brother Inside" postscript picture that I feel serves little but to further
trivialize this matter. <p>

Such "power by numbers" petitions remind me of the efforts (sometimes
successful) of various pressure groups to force advertisers to drop support
of television programs with aspects that the particular group finds
distasteful, and of the practice of some radio talk show hosts to encourage
their listeners to flood some entity with calls and/or letters opposing or
supporting particular views.  In almost all of these cases, the key isn't
reasoned debate, it's just names and numbers--to try blind them with shear
volume! <p>

That such techniques are sometimes successful, and that politicians and
organizations will often react to such pressure petition drives, should not
be an endorsement of such techniques being used.  There is more at stake
than simply "winning" a particular argument--the general coarsening of
debate on so many topics into a flurry of opinion polls, petition drives,
emotional television images, and the briefest of soundbites, threatens to
change the nature of democracy in fundamental and negative ways. <p>

Clipper may not be the most important issue facing the world today.  But
there seems to be a trend toward treating this highly technical issue the
same way we tend to treat discussions of gun control, abortion, and criminal
sentencing in the U.S.--that is, with a maximum of emotion and a minimum of
logic. <p>

I don't like Clipper.  I think it's a bad idea.  I have expressed this
sentiment in the past in detail, so I won't go into the details again now.
Almost a year ago in this forum, I suggested that interested persons on both
sides of the issue inform their representatives and the involved parties of
their thoughts on the matter and to express their opinions in PRIVACY Forum
as well.  I had hoped that such communications would be thoughtful and rich
in meaningful arguments that would raise the level of discourse.  I am
discouraged to see the level of discussion now appearing from some messages
in the PRIVACY Forum submission inbox and in some other network lists
and newsgroups. <p>

Please folks.  I know it's easy to get wound up in these matters--all
the more so when it's so simple to just shoot off an e-mail message
in a matter of minutes.  But unless we all try to take the high road in
these discussions, the importance of the issues are going to be drowned
out in the shouting.  Then, ultimately, we *all* lose, on both
sides of the debate. <p>

A sampling of the Clipper messages that I thought were most suitable for
this issue of the digest have been included below, along with other
non-Clipper items. <p>

 Re: Campaign and Petition Against Clipper from Dorothy Denning [I may have sent this before, excuse if I did ..djf] <p>

Date:    Wed, 09 Feb 1994 17:23:28 -0500 (EST)
From:    denning@cs.georgetown.edu (Dorothy Denning)
Subject: Re: Campaign and Petition Against Clipper <p>

CPSR has announced a petition campaign to oppose the Clipper
initiative. I would like to caution people about signing the petition.
The issues are extremely complex and difficult. The Clipper initiative
is the result of considerable deliberation by many intelligent people
who appreciate and understand the concerns that have been expressed and
who worked hard to accommodate the conflicting interests.  The
decisions that have been made were not made lightly. <p>

I would like to respond to some of the statements that CPSR has made
about Clipper in their campaign and petition letters: <p>

The Clipper proposal, developed in secret by the National Security
     Agency, is a technical standard that will make it easier for
     government agents to wiretap the emerging data highway. <p>

The standard (FIPS 185) is not a standard for the Internet or any other
high speed computer network.  It is for the telephone system.  Quoting
from FIPS 185:  "Data for purposes of this standard includes voice,
facsimile and computer information communicated in a telephone system.
A telephone system for purposes of this standard is limited to a system
which is circuit switched and operating at data rates of standard
commercial modems over analog voice circuits or which uses basic-rate
ISDN or a similar grade wireless service." <p>

The standard will not make it any easier to tap phones, let alone
computer networks.  All it will do is make it technically possible to
decrypt communications that are encrypted with the standard, assuming
the communications are not superencrypted with something else.  Law
enforcers still need to get a court order just to intercept the
communications in the first place, and advances in technology have made
interception itself more difficult.  The standard will make it much
harder for anyone to conduct illegal taps, including the government. <p>

The purpose of the standard is to provide a very strong encryption
algorithm - something much stronger than DES - and to do so in a way
that does not thwart law enforcement and national security objectives.
Keys are escrowed so that if someone uses this technology, they cannot
use it against national interests. <p>

Industry groups, professional associations and civil liberties
     organizations have expressed almost unanimous opposition to the
     plan since it was first proposed in April 1993. <p>

"The public does not like Clipper and will not accept it ..." <p>

The private sector and the public have expressed nearly unanimous
     opposition to Clipper. <p>

As near as I know, neither CPSR nor any other group has conducted any
systematic poll of industry, professional societies, or the public.
While many people have voiced opposition, there are many more
organizations and people who have been silent on this issue.  The ACM
is in the process of conducting a study on encryption.  CPSR is a
member of the study group, as am I.  Steve Kent is chair.  Our goal is
a report that will articulate the issues, not a public statement either
for or against.  The International Association for Cryptologic Research
has not to my knowledge made any official statement about Clipper. <p>

The Administration ignored the overwhelming opposition of the
     general public. When the Commerce Department solicited public
     comments on the proposal last fall, hundreds of people opposed the
     plan while only a few expressed support. <p>

Hundreds of people is hardly overwhelming in a population of 250
million, especially when most of the letters were the same and came in
through the net following a sample letter that was sent out. <p>

The technical standard is subject to misuse and compromise. It
     would provide government agents with copies of the keys that
     protect electronic communications. "It is a nightmare for computer
     security." <p>

I have been one of the reviewers of the standard.  We have completed
our review of the encryption algorithm, SKIPJACK, and concluded it was
very strong.  While we have not completed our review of the key escrow
system, from what I have seen so far, I anticipate that it will provide
an extremely high level of security for the escrowed keys. <p>

The underlying technology was developed in secret by the NSA, an
     intelligence agency responsible for electronic eavesdropping, not
     privacy protection. Congressional investigations in the 1970s
     disclosed widespread NSA abuses, including the illegal
     interception of millions of cables sent by American citizens. <p>

NSA is also responsible for the development of cryptographic codes to
protect the nation's most sensitive classified information.  They have
an excellent track record in conducting this mission.  I do not believe
that our requirements for protecting private information are greater
than those for protecting classified information.  I do not know the
facts of the 1970s incident that is referred to here, but it sounds
like it occurred before passage of the 1978 Foreign Intelligence
Surveillance Act.  This act requires intelligence agencies to get a
court order in order to intercept communications of American citizens.
I am not aware of any recent evidence that the NSA is engaging
in illegal intercepts of Americans. <p>

Computer security experts question the integrity of the
     technology.  Clipper was developed in secret and its
     specifications are classified. <p>

The 5 of us who reviewed the algorithm unanimously agreed that it was
very strong.  We will publish a final report when we complete or full
evaluation.  Nothing can be concluded from a statement questioning the
technology by someone who has not seen it regardless of whether that
person is an expert in security. <p>

NSA overstepped its legal authority in developing the standard.  A
     1987 law explicitly limits the intelligence agency's power to set
     standards for the nation's communications network. <p>

The 1987 Computer Security Act states that NIST "shall draw on the
technical advice and assistance (including work products) of the
National Security Agency." <p>

There is no evidence to support law enforcement's claims that new
     technologies are hampering criminal investigations. CPSR recently
     forced the release of FBI documents that show no such problems. <p>

CPSR obtained some documents from a few FBI field offices.  Those
offices reported no problems.  CPSR did not get reports from all field
offices and did not get reports from local law enforcement agencies.  I
can tell you that it is a fact that new communications technologies,
including encryption, have hampered criminal investigations.  I
personally commend law enforcement for trying to get out in front of
this problem. <p>

If the plan goes forward, commercial firms that hope to develop
     new products will face extensive government obstacles.
     Cryptographers who wish to develop new privacy enhancing
     technologies will be discouraged. <p>

The standard is voluntary -- even for the government. <p>

Mr. Rotenberg said "We want the public to understand the full
     implications of this plan.  Today it is only a few experts and
     industry groups that understand the proposal. <p>

I support this objective.  Unfortunately, it is not possible for most
of us to be fully informed of the national security implications of
uncontrolled encryption.  For very legitimate reasons, these cannot be
fully discussed and debated in a public forum.  It is even difficult to
talk about the full implications of encryption on law enforcement.
This is why it is important that the President and Vice-President be
fully informed on all the issues, and for the decisions to be made at
that level.  The Feb. 4 decision was made following an inter-agency
policy review, headed by the National Security Council, that examined
these issues using considerable input from industry, CPSR, EFF, and
individuals as well as from law enforcement and intelligence agencies.
In the absence of understanding the national security issues, I believe
we need to exercise some caution in believing that we can understand
the full implications of encryption on society. <p>

As part of the Feb. 4 announcement, the Administration announced
the establishment of an Interagency Working Group on Encryption
and Telecommunications, chaired by the White House Office of
Science and Technology Policy and National Security Council, with
representatives from Commerce, Justice, State, Treasury, FBI,
NSA, OMB, and the National Economic Council.  The group is to
work with industry and public interest groups to develop new
encryption technologies and to review and refine encryption policy.
The NRC's Computer Science and Telecommunications Board will also
be conducting a study of encryption policy. <p>

These comments may be distributed. <p>

The Clipper Chip Will Block Crime [ for ip] <p>

Date: Tue, 22 Feb 1994 17:22:55 -0500 (EST)
From: denning@cs.cosc.georgetown.edu (Dorothy Denning) <p>

The Clipper Chip Will Block Crime <p>

By Dorothy E. Denning <p>

Hidden among the discussions of the information highway is a fierce
debate, with huge implications for everyone.  It centers on a tiny
computer chip called the Clipper, which uses sophisticated coding to
scramble electronic communications transmitted through the phone
system. <p>

The Clinton administration has adopted the chip, which would allow
law enforcement agencies with court warrants to read the Clipper codes
and eavesdrop on terrorists and criminals.  But opponents say that, if
this happens, the privacy of law-abiding individuals will be a risk.
They want people to be able to use their own scramblers, which the
government would not be able to decode. <p>

If the opponents get their way, however, all communications on the
information highway would be immune from lawful interception.  In a
world threatened by international organized crime, terrorism, and rogue
governments, this would be folly.  In testimony before Congress, Donald
Delaney, senior investigator with the New York State Police, warned
that if we adopted an encoding standard that did not permit lawful
intercepts, we would have havoc in the United States. <p>

Moreover, the Clipper coding offers safeguards against casual
government intrusion.  It requires that one of the two components of
a key embedded in the chip be kept with the Treasury Department and the
other component with the Commerce Department's National Institute of
Standards and Technology.  Any law enforcement official wanting to
wiretap would need to obtain not only a warrant but the separate
components from the two agencies.  This, plus the superstrong code and
key system would make it virtually impossible for anyone, even corrupt
government officials, to spy illegally. <p>

But would terrorists use Clipper?  The Justice Department has
ordered $8 million worth of Clipper scramblers in the hope that they
will become so widespread and convenient that everyone will use them.
Opponents say that terrorists will not be so foolish as to use
encryption to which the government holds the key but will scramble
their calls with their own code systems.  But then who would have
thought that the World Trade Center bombers would have been stupid
enough to return a truck that they had rented? <p>

Court-authorized interception of communications has been essential
for preventing and solving many serious and often violent crimes,
including terrorism, organized crime, drugs, kidnaping, and political
corruption.  The FBI alone has had many spectacular successes that
depended on wiretaps.  In a Chicago case code-named RUKBOM, they
prevented the El Rukn street gang, which was acting on behalf of the
Libyan government, from shooting down a commercial airliner using a
stolen military weapons system. <p>

To protect against abuse of electronic surveillance, federal
statutes impose stringent requirements on the approval and execution
of wiretaps.  Wiretaps are used judiciously (only 846 installed
wiretaps in 1992) and are targeted at major criminals. <p>

Now, the thought of the FBI wiretapping my communications appeals to
me about as much as its searching my home and seizing my papers.
But the Constitution does not give us absolute privacy from
court-ordered searches and seizures, and for good reason.  Lawlessness
would prevail. <p>

Encoding technologies, which offer privacy, are on a collision
course with a major crime-fighting tool: wiretapping.  Now the
Clipper chip shows that strong encoding can be made available in a way
that protects private communications but does not harm society if it
gets into the wrong hands.  Clipper is a good idea, and it needs
support from people who recognize the need for both privacy and
effective law enforcement on the information highway. <p>

FBI Director on industrial espionage <p>

From: kadie@cs.uiuc.edu (Carl M Kadie) <p>

Quotes of FBI Director Louis Freeh from a Clarinet/Reuters story. He
was speaking to the Executives' Club of Chicago on Thursday. <p>

"The threat is real." <p>

"A nation's power is increasingly measured by economic
prosperity at home and competitiveness abroad. And in some ways, the
United States is a sitting duck for countries and individuals who want
to take a short cut to power." <p>

"We had $1.5 trillion invested in research and development during the
1980's alone. We also have an open society and a devotion to free
market principles that can make it relatively easy to steal secrets
and technology." <p>

[At least 20 nations are] "actively engaged in economic espionage." <p>

"This kind of information [cost and price structure, research and
development results, marketing plans, bids and customer lists] can be
intercepted from fax and satellite communications. It can be monitored
from cellular and microwave telephone links. It can be retrieved from
inadequately protected computer systems." <p>

"Advanced telecommunications technology will make it impossible for
the FBI to carry out court-approved surveillance in life-and-death
cases." <p>

"The country will be unable to protect itself against terrorism,
violent crime, foreign threats, drug trafficking, espionage,
kidnapping and other grave crimes." <p>

"Development of technology is moving so rapidly that several hundred
court-authorized surveillances already have been prevented by new
technological impediments with advanced communications equipment." <p>

CPSR Clipper Petition /rsp to Denning
Dave, <p>

Nice to see you in SF. <p>

I hear that you circulated Dorothy's comments on the
CPSR Clipper petition to Interesting People.  How
about circulating the response? <p>

Thanks, <p>

Marc. <p>

<hr> <p>

Dorothy Denning has raised important questions about the Clipper proposal.
As she says "the issues are extremely complex and difficult." Below I've
tried to answer the points she has raised.  Please read her comments and my
response.  Speak with others interested in the Clipper proposal.  If on
balance, after reviewing the arguments, you decide Clipper is a mistake
then you should express your opposition by sending a message to: <p>

CLIPPER.PETITION@CPSR.ORG <p>

with the words <p>

"I oppose Clipper" <p>

in the subject header.  If you have already signed the petition, ask a
friend or colleague to sign. <p>

Your help is needed. <p>

Marc Rotenberg, director, CPSR Washington office <p>

&gt;&gt;  The Clipper proposal, developed in secret by the
&gt;&gt;  National Security Agency, is a technical standard
&gt;&gt;  that will make it easier for government agents to
&gt;&gt;  wiretap the emerging data highway. <p>

&gt;  The standard (FIPS 185) is not a standard for the
&gt;  Internet or any other high speed computer network.  It
&gt;  is for the telephone system. <p>

The letter to the President makes clear that we are concerned about
"Clipper and associated standards" which include the Capstone EES
configuration for data transmission. <p>

It is clearly the intent of the EES proposal to cover both voice and data
transmissions. <p>

&gt;  The standard will not make it any easier to tap phones,
&gt;  let alone computer networks.  All it will do is make it
&gt;  technically possible to decrypt communications that are
&gt;  encrypted with the standard, assuming the communications
&gt;  are not superencrypted with something else. <p>

This is a little bit like saying that leaving a master key for every house
on your block with the police will not make it easier for the police to
open locked doors. <p>

We may disagree about whether this is a good idea, but let's be clear about
the intent of the proposal. <p>

&gt;  The purpose of the standard is to provide a very strong
&gt;  encryption algorithm - something much stronger than DES
&gt;  - and to do so in a way that does not thwart law
&gt;  enforcement and national security objectives.  Keys are
&gt;  escrowed so that if someone uses this technology, they
&gt;  cannot use it against national interests. <p>

The NSA is responsible for foreign signal interception.  It has no legal
authority to conduct wire surveillance.  What are the NSA's "national
security" interests in domestic wire surveillance? <p>

&gt;&gt;  Industry groups, professional associations and
&gt;&gt;  civil liberties organizations have expressed almost
&gt;&gt;  unanimous opposition to the plan since it was first
&gt;&gt;  proposed in April 1993. <p>

&gt;&gt;  The private sector and the public have expressed
&gt;&gt;  nearly unanimous opposition to Clipper. <p>

&gt;  As near as I know, neither CPSR nor any other group has
&gt;  conducted any systematic poll of industry, professional
&gt;  societies, or the public. <p>

To the best of my knowledge, there has never been a proposed technical
standard that generated more opposition.  Firms across the
telecommunications and computer industry oppose Clipper.  Computer security
people and cryptographers oppose Clipper.  Privacy experts oppose Clipper. <p>

&gt;&gt;  The Administration ignored the overwhelming
&gt;&gt;  opposition of the general public. When the Commerce
&gt;&gt;  Department solicited public comments on the
&gt;&gt;  proposal last fall, hundreds of people opposed the
&gt;  plan while only a few expressed support. <p>

&gt;  Hundreds of people is hardly overwhelming in a
&gt;  population of 250 million, especially when most of the
&gt;  letters were the same and came in through the net
&gt;  following a sample letter that was sent out. <p>

I would encourage Dorothy, or anyone else, to take a poll of any
representative user group -- Interesting People perhaps -- if there
is any doubt about how the public feels about the proposal. <p>

&gt;&gt;  The technical standard is subject to misuse and
&gt;&gt;  compromise. It would provide government agents with
&gt;&gt;  copies of the keys that protect electronic
&gt;&gt;  communications. "It is a nightmare for computer
&gt;&gt;  security." <p>

&gt;  I have been one of the reviewers of the standard.  We
&gt;  have completed our review of the encryption algorithm,
&gt;  SKIPJACK, and concluded it was very strong.  While we
&gt;  have not completed our review of the key escrow system,
&gt;  from what I have seen so far, I anticipate that it will
&gt;  provide an extremely high level of security for the
&gt;  escrowed keys. <p>

Dorothy endorsed the proposal before she joined the "review" team.  The
group that she refers to, a White House task force, has an interesting
history.  The majority of cryptographers asked to participate declined. <p>

&gt;&gt;  The underlying technology was developed in secret
&gt;&gt;  by the NSA, an intelligence agency responsible for
&gt;&gt;  electronic eavesdropping, not privacy protection.
&gt;&gt;  Congressional investigations in the 1970s disclosed
&gt;&gt;  widespread NSA abuses, including the illegal
&gt;&gt;  interception of millions of cables sent by American
&gt;&gt;  citizens. <p>

&gt;  NSA is also responsible for the development of
&gt;  cryptographic codes to protect the nation's most
&gt;  sensitive classified information.  They have an
&gt;  excellent track record in conducting this mission. <p>

Senator Frank Church, who conducted the most extensive hearings ever held
on the National Security Agency, said that the NSA's intelligence gathering
capabilities were important for the security of the United States.  He also
said that the massive eavesdropping capability created "A tremendous
potential for abuse." If ever turned against the communications system of
the United States: <p>

no American would have any privacy left . . . there
  would be no place to hide. <p>

We must see to it that this agency and all agencies
  that possess this technology operate within the law and
  under proper supervision, so that we never cross
  over that abyss.  That is an abyss from which there
  is no return. " (NBC Meet the Press, 1975) <p>

&gt;&gt;  Computer security experts question the integrity of
&gt;&gt; the technology. Clipper was developed in secret and
&gt;&gt;  its specifications are classified. <p>

&gt;  The 5 of us who reviewed the algorithm unanimously
&gt;  agreed that it was very strong.  We will publish a final
&gt;  report when we complete or full evaluation. Nothing can
&gt;  be concluded from a statement questioning the technology
&gt;  by someone who has not seen it regardless of whether
&gt;  that person is an expert in security. <p>

The original CPSR letter to the President, asking for the withdrawal of
Clipper, was signed by Hellman, Rivest, Diffie, Merkle, and others.  Many
more experts are adding their names daily to the CPSR petition. <p>

&gt;&gt;  NSA overstepped its legal authority in developing
&gt;&gt;  the standard.  A 1987 law explicitly limits the
&gt;&gt;  intelligence agency's power to set standards for
&gt;&gt;  the nation's communications network. <p>

&gt;  The 1987 Computer Security Act states that NIST "shall
&gt;  draw on the technical advice and assistance (including
&gt;  work products) of the National Security Agency." <p>

The original replacement for DES, proposed by the Department of Commerce in
1989, would have had these characteristics: <p>

-- public, unclassified
-- implementable in both hardware or software
-- usable by federal Agencies and U.S. based multi-national corporation
-- a level of security sufficient for the protection of unclassified,
   sensitive information and commercial propriety and/or valuable
information. <p>

The final proposal, developed with the "technical assistance" of the NSA,
has these characteristics. <p>

-- The Clipper algorithm Skipjack is classified
-- Public access to the reasons underlying the proposal is restricted
-- Skipjack can be implemented only in tamper-proof hardware
-- It will not be used by multi-national corporations
-- The security of the configuration remains unproven. <p>

The Computer Security Act was passed precisely because the NSA tried
previously to grab civilian computer security turf.  The law was
specifically intended to control the type of abuse that results from secret
standard-setting arrangements. <p>

If there any doubt among Interesting People about the illegal activities of
the NSA in the development of the EES, please consult the minutes of the
NSA/NIST Technical Working Group (TWG) that produced the standard.  The
minutes should be available from the National Security Agency Public
Information Office.  That phone number is 301/688-6524. <p>

&gt;&gt;  There is no evidence to support law enforcement's
&gt;&gt;  claims that new technologies are hampering criminal
&gt;&gt;  investigations. CPSR recently forced the release of
&gt;&gt;  FBI documents that show no such problems. <p>

&gt;  CPSR obtained some documents from a few FBI field
&gt;  offices.  Those offices reported no problems.  CPSR did
&gt;  not get reports from all field offices and did not get
&gt;  reports from local law enforcement agencies.  I can tell
&gt;  you that it is a fact that new communications
&gt;  technologies, including encryption, have hampered
&gt;  criminal investigations. <p>

The statement is illogical.  There is still no evidence to support the FBI's
claims. <p>

The FBI made certain claims that cryptography was impeding criminal
investigation conducted by wiretap.  CPSR investigated the FBI's claims by
filing a Freedom of Information Act suit to obtain the relevant documents.
The documents provided to us by the Department of Justice revealed that
none of the FBI field officers had encountered any obstacles.  The
Department of Justice has just informed us that they provided to us all
relevant documents concerning the Clipper proposal. <p>

There is one reported case where cryptography made it difficult for law
enforcement to obtain evidence. That case concerned reading the contents of
a file on a hard disk after it was seized. <p>

If this is the problem that the Clipper proposal is intended to solve, then
the key escrow scheme must be extended to every single encrypted file -- not
just encrypted communications -- everywhere in the world. <p>

Every encrypted file. Everywhere. <p>

&gt;&gt;  If the plan goes forward, commercial firms that
&gt;&gt;  hope to develop new products will face extensive
&gt;&gt;  government obstacles. Cryptographers who wish to
&gt;&gt;  develop new privacy enhancing technologies will be
&gt;&gt;  discouraged. <p>

&gt;  The standard is voluntary -- even for the government. <p>

An FBI legislative proposal now under consideration at the White House
would mandate a Clipper-like scheme.  That proposal is backed by fines up
to $10,000 per day and jail time. <p>

That's not voluntary. <p>

&gt;&gt;  Mr. Rotenberg said "We want the public to
&gt;&gt;  understand the full implications of this plan.
&gt;&gt;  Today it is only a few experts and  industry groups
&gt;&gt;  that understand the proposal. <p>

&gt;  I support this objective.  Unfortunately, it is not
&gt;  possible for most of us to be fully informed of the
&gt;  national security implications of uncontrolled
&gt;  encryption.  For very legitimate reasons, these cannot
&gt;  be fully discussed and debated in a public forum. <p>

This assertion has never been supported by evidence.  It has been used
simply to stifle criticism. <p>

&gt;  The Feb. 4 decision was made
&gt;  following an inter-agency policy review, headed by the
&gt;  National Security Council, that examined these issues
&gt;  using considerable input from industry, CPSR, EFF, and
&gt;  individuals as well as from law enforcement and
&gt;  intell <p>

CPSR did not participate in the inter-agency policy review.  Our position
from the very beginning is that these decisions must be made openly. <p>

&gt;  In the absence of understanding
&gt;  the national security issues, I believe we need to
&gt;  exercise some caution in believing that we can
&gt;  understand the full implications of encryption on
&gt;  society. <p>

This premise, if accepted, would mean that people in the United States
would have no right to express political views when the government claimed
"national security." Certainly, there are matters of national security that
must be protected, but when an agency with expertise in wire surveillance
develops a secret standard for eavesdropping and tells those who raise
questions that there are matters of national security that they would not
understand, there is good reason for concern. <p>

&gt; from Howard White
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Your responses to the Campaign and Petition Against Clipper document were
&gt; &gt; good. Thank you for the attention to the topic. I'd like to ask one
&gt; &gt; question of my own. Why has the EFF seeminglly taken such a strong stand
&gt; &gt; against Clipper? <p>

[Denning replies:] <p>

&gt; Thanks for your kind words.  I don't know why really, but I speculate that
&gt; they just don't take seriously what the FBI and NSA say about law enforcement
&gt; and national security concerns.  The EFF founders have been opposing these
&gt; parts of the government since their youth.  EFF was originally started
&gt; to defend hackers against over-zealous law enforcers.
&gt;
&gt; Dorothy <p>

Hmm, well Howard, Dr. Denning, last I looked, is not an EFF spokesperson,
so I wouldn't put too much weight on her comments about what EFF does and
does not take seriously. <p>

Casting aspersions on people's allegedly wilder youths has no
relevance to current policy matters.  By such reasoning, Dr. Denning
should also be opposed to Clipper, since the head of the govt. pushing
Clipper admits to having smoked marijuana, and may have even dodged the
draft back in the hippie era. <p>

Also EFF was not founded as a hacker defense organization.  It was founded
to protect, and help define, civil liberties in the realm of computers and
telecommunications.  That some of these cases are cases of alleged system
crackers is not surprising, but it hardly indicates that EFF is limited
to, or began as, "hacker defense".  Such [lack of] logic is tatamount to
saying that the US welfare system is a Black support fund, because more
African-Americans are using it that Anglos, Asians, or Hispanics. <p>

Avoiding such diversions, and getting back to the real issue here:
for the record, EFF is indeed concerned with national security and law
enforcement, but does not see that Clipper will in any way serve legitimate
law enforcement or national security needs.  It was publicly known, right from
day one, that Clipper is tappable by LE and intelligence agencies, and
that the keys are held by govt. institutions.  Criminals, spies and
terrorists are highly unlikely to use Clipper or other Skipjack-based
"products" like Capstone and Tessera.  The "products" threaten the
viability of US businesses, as do the current crypto export regulations;
not to mention that the govt. is not in the business of being in business,
and competing in a cryptography product marketplace - the govt. is
supposed to be in the business of governing (protecting US citizens from
depradations of those that would harm their person or property, and
protecting the US from foreign invasion.) <p>

The privacy risks involved with a scheme like the Clipper EES system far
outweigh the gains for (legitmate) law enforcement and intelligence
efforts, particulary given the following: <p>

* the "authorization" required to get Clipper keys is left entirely undefined
* proof of this authorization will supposedly only be required to be *faxed*,
  leaving the entire escrow system wide open for abuse
* the algorithm is classified, and thus is not open to the public scrutiny
  necessary to see if it is adequate security, even without key escrow
* key escrow is, conceptually, no different from a requirement that police
  and spies have copies of all of your house and car keys, your computer
  passwords, and your safe combinations - key escrow is un-American and
  unconsitutional.
* the NSA, in direct countervention of the spirit, if not the word, of
  legislation prohibiting it's involvement in domestic surveillance, has
  been the primary driving force behind Clipper from the outset.
* the keys, as of the most recent White House briefings, are to be held by
  agencies that are closely related to the very law enforcement and
  intelligence bodies the split-key escrow system is supposed to protect
  users from
* any security system with a security hole (like key escrow) is, by very
  definition, insecure.  Relying upon an insecure system thought to
  be secure is often more dangerous that having little or no security (and
  being well aware of the fact, and able to plan accordingly)
* referring to "key escrow" as "escrow" at all is misleading.  A true escrow
  system would hold users keys *for the users*.  The current Clipper plans
  would hold users keys *for police and intelligence agents*.  The "key
  escrow" scheme is actually a key *surrender* scheme.
* under current Dept. of Justice regulations for obtaining escrowed keys,
  there is no mechanism in place to ensure that the keys requested are
  relevant to the case at all, belong to the person the requesting agencies
  think they do, or are destroyed after the monitoring ceases.  Furthermore,
  there is no way to enforce the cessation of monitoring after the legally
  "authorized" cut-off date, nor are any procedures in place for assuring
  that the unscrupulous do not begin building "collections" of keys,
  surrepetitiously.  Even more disturbing, though, is that possession
  of the keys allows agents to decrypt *all* communications, even from
  years past, made with that key, regardless of whether or not the
  communications are relevant to the case at hand.
* worse yet, the regulations conclude with a notice that basically says that
  *even if the key [and thus the evidence] is obtained by breaking every
  single rule of the procedure, illegally* that the evidence is still
  admissible in court.  This attempts to get around all legal restriction
  regarding what is and is not proper evidence.  Such a [lack of]
  regulation could easily subvert the entire judicial process, and make a
  mockery of the democracy this country was founded on.  This system
  dangerously sets up a system of "rules" that can be broken with impunity,
  while still allowing the rulebreaker to "win the game."  To be viable,
  the system would have to ensure that, like the rest of the
  evidence-gathering process, use of escrowed keys most be done properly for
  evidence to be admissable, and that agents and agencies that abuse the
  system are liable for their criminal behaviour.
* because only privacy-careless law abiding citizens, and very stupid
  criminals, would use Clipper, Clipper appears to be designed with
  the monitoring of non-criminals in mind.  The only way that Clipper would
  be of any use in catching the "terrorists, drug dealers, and child
  molesters" govt. spokespersons wave before the public like scarecrows
  [shades of "the Reds are coming, the Reds are coming!], would be if all
  non-key-escrow crypto is outlawed.  The Administration, today, says it
  has no plans to ban non-EES cryptographic applications.  However the
  Administration also promised a full report on the viability of Clipper, and
  instead simply announced it's intentions, despite clear majority opinion
  against Clipper, to proceed full steam ahead, with out the necessary
  legislative involvement; no report has yet been issued.  Keep in mind also
  that the Clinton Administration is unlikely to last beyond the next 3 years.
  The Admin. that follows may very well decide to ban non-Clipper crypto.
  The Administration's assurances on this matter, then, are the farthest
  thing from comforting or sufficient.  Logically, Clipper is either designed
  with the intent to rid the US of cryptography that the NSA cannot peek
  through, or it is designed for cloak-and-dagger monitoring of those who
  are not even criminals (perhaps those with unpopular religious or political
  views).  There are simply no other reasonable explanations.
* and, finally, wiretaps are not as useful to law enforcement as law
  enforcement would like people to believe.  Only about 1000, often fewer,
  wiretaps are done each year in the US.  Only a small fraction of them
  yield convictions.  Certain agencies of the govt. would like to compromise
  the privacy, security, and civil liberties of the entire populace to
  preserve one of the least-used and least-effective investigative methods
  available to law enforcement. <p>

&gt; Thanks for your answer. I've been reading books and articles about the EFF
&gt; for several years now and I've met Mitch Kapor through cyberspace so I
&gt; think my understanding of the EFF is well rounded and mature. My take on
&gt; the EFF is that the founders saw that law enforcement blundering around in
&gt; cyperspace using the current legal standards which were highly
&gt; inappropriate. The test cases have clearly shown that law enforcement has
&gt; made huge errors. The EFF has stated many times that theft and/or
&gt; distribution of passwords, credit card numbers, phone access codes, and the
&gt; like is clearly illegal. The EFF clearly wants illegal activities stopped.
&gt; But law enforcement practices that dictated total confiscation of computer
&gt; equipment that is only suppected of containing illegal information seems a
&gt; bit much. Besides, as the EFF has said, the legal costs of even proscuting
&gt; kids (hackers) for exploration and adventure is something most tax paying
&gt; citizens would blast is very waistful. If business and government can't
&gt; protect themselves against children playing around in the networks then
&gt; tough. The government does not take way a child's bike for a traffic
&gt; violation even though damage to property and lives are very much a reality.
&gt; The EFF, I think, is just trying to bring some sanity to the situation.
&gt;
&gt; Sorry about the ranting. I think that it is a GOOD THING that, in your
&gt; words, the "EFF was originally started to defend hackers against
&gt; OVER-ZEALOUS law enforcers." OVER-ZEALOUS is a BAD THING in absolute terms.
&gt; Clipper seems to me to be over-zealous, because it gives absolute power to
&gt; government law enforcement agencies. Even I can easily imagine each
&gt; government law enforcement agency forming independant super secret groups
&gt; that do nothing but snoop around the net examining and acting on any
&gt; information they see. <p>

Well said, Howard!  Saved me a lot of typing! <p>

&gt; Thanks very much for your time.
&gt;

&gt; &gt;Dorothy <p>

Please quote us some of these '"facts"'.  If you are talking about general
Usenet chatter, well, of course some facts are wrong.  That's Usenet.  It
appears to me, however, that you imply that EFF and similar organizations
have been actively disseminating misinformation.  If that is indeed the
gist, please defend this assertion. <p>

&gt; I may have seen your name in some of the books and articles over the past
&gt; few years. Many of the errors that I'm speaking of were those in the late
&gt; eighties. Clifford Stolls story and the "Great Hacker Crackdown". It wasn't
&gt; just the errors of over-zealousness. <p>

Clifford Stoll's story had nothing to do with the EFF and related hacker
cases you are referring to, nor with Operation Sundevil.  Stoll's book
dealt with the case of a German spy working for the KGB.  Maybe it's time
you did a re-read? <p>

&gt; Getting law enforcement to pay
&gt; attention also was nearly impossible at times too. It still is. It seems as
&gt; if the government agencies have no foot soldiers and can only drop the bomb
&gt; when brought into potential computer crime cases. <p>

I don't think any of us will accept that as a valid excuse.  If the
problem is manpower, perhaps they should hire more cops, or better yet,
stop trying to prosecute people for consensual, victimless, and
perpetrator-as-sole-victim crimes.  If the problem is funding, see
previous sentence.  If the problem is ignorance of technical topics, there
are such things as books and classes. <p>

&gt; And I don't blame the government. I blame the inherent anarchy of computers
&gt; and computing. Electronic computing by its very nature is uncontrollable.
&gt; Trying to control computing technologies is just like trying to control
&gt; people's minds or trying to control people's writings. <p>

Absolutely. <p>

&gt; When you try to
&gt; control computing its only the unknowing who are hurt. The informed
&gt; computer community will know how to neutralize Clipper with other public
&gt; domain encryption standards like PGP and RIPEM. And maybe the public domain
&gt; stuff is not as tough as Clipper, none of this is really the point for me. <p>

The use of PD crypto, or any non-EES crypto, could easily be outlawed.
This is NOT a valid assurance, no matter how much the Administration likes
to pretend it is. <p>

&gt; I've seen how misunderstanding computing technologies can be the ruin of
&gt; information structures and information systems. Computers are not well
&gt; understood yet. After ten years of implementation, personal computers are
&gt; just starting to be understood by institutions and organizations. It will
&gt; be twenty years more before the general public begins to have a feel for
&gt; what computers and computing can truly do. At the same time computing has
&gt; gone from the horse'n buggy to the jet plane by comparison. And tomorrow,
&gt; users will be flying at light speed in outer space by comparison. Dec's
&gt; Alpha chip and IBM/Apple/Motarola's PowerPC will put supercomputing speeds
&gt; on the desktop. The speed of light speed limit, which was supposed to have
&gt; kicked in by now, does not seem to be slowing chip engineers down in the
&gt; least. Every eighteen months chip cycle speeds double and chip prices go
&gt; down by half. Humankind will have access to practically unlimited computer
&gt; power early in the twenty-first century.  Remember Television. How proud
&gt; are we of our low resolution video standard now. There is no need to rush
&gt; any encryption technology into place as a standard right now. <p>

That's a very rousing statement, and one I fully agree with. <p>

&gt; Most computer users don't know how to truly use what computing power they
&gt; have now. And worse, Clipper seems to establish a process which trys to
&gt; limit some aspect of the unlimitable right now. As time goes on,
&gt; governments will make it a habit of putting limits in place and fewer
&gt; citizens will even notice those limits. <p>

Yes, and the worst danger is that limits placed on future technology don't
just limit what we predict is coming; they limit all the new things we
haven't thought of yet, for generations, maybe forever. <p>

&gt; And once again human kind world
&gt; wide will experience government inefficiency and bureaucracy without even
&gt; having to thinking about it. When will governments learn they can't limit
&gt; the mind, NOR CAN GOVERNMENTS LIMIT TOOLS OF THE MIND. Governments are only
&gt; successful when they educate their people about GOOD THINGS; i.e. unlimited
&gt; computing access. Our government seems to be showing off this encryption
&gt; standard as a politically timed event for some crime bill, rather than
&gt; focusing political energy on the huge education task at hand. <p>

Here I'll have to differ with you: govt. that is truly efficient is
dangerous.  Witness Hitler's regime.  Don't confuse interference with
inefficiency. A non-interfering govt. that is inefficient is desirable.
Personally I don't think any govt. is effective or successful at
education, only at propagandizing in the name of education.  The function
of govt. is to physically protect (and, if you are not a fan of
unregulated free markets, to ensure competition, prevent monopoly, and a
few other such functions.)  Private education is almost universally more
effective that govt.-run education.  IMNERHO. <p>

&gt; The Clipper chip would be almost a petty thing if it weren't for the way in
&gt; which the FBI and NSA seem to be involved behind the scenes. I'd probably
&gt; be content to sit and watch this whole thing blow over if it weren't for
&gt; the FBI and NSA's involvement. Those two organizations could, and probably
&gt; have started wars. The NSA is really scary. Everything I've ever read about
&gt; the NSA shows it to be completely structured around secrecy. The Secret
&gt; Service, the FBI, and the CIA have had plenty of light blasting through
&gt; their cobwebs and catacombs. The NSA is a polished black sphere of solid
&gt; granite by comparison. Throughout history organizations that form around
&gt; secrecy always spoil and rot from the inside out. The government will have
&gt; its Clipper protected secrets and everyone else's Clipper protected secrets
&gt; too. Something smells fishy to me. Hell! This stinks to high heaven...
&gt; Sorry, my nose kind of got out of control there. <p>

Yes, No Such Agency's involvement is what makes the scheme dangerous,
because NSA has a lot of weight to throw around, and skeleton keys to the
chambers of the highest (phrases like "national security" and "terrorist
threat" tend to open plenty of metaphorical doors.)  If Clipper had been
cooked up entirely by Clinton and Gore, it would be a laugh, since as a
product it is doomed.  As an NSA-sponsored govt. standard, it is very much
a threat. <p>

&gt; The Clipper chip standard could itself be a very GOOD THING. Solid data and
&gt; voice security for everyone. Designed, established and implemented by the
&gt; government for the good of the public. Promoted and sold to the tax paying
&gt; citizens of country by our elected leaders... That's how things should
&gt; work! <p>

Eh...I'd disagree, personally.  Perhaps the Skipjack algorithm is secure
(which I personally doubt very seriously), but the Clipper system is a
bust, and it is not the place of our govt. to be selling us products.
That's what Viacrypt and PKP/RSADSI are for.  I certainly don't feel like
paying AGAIN for something developed with my tax dollars. <p>

&gt; But the process by which this encryption standard is being
&gt; implemented may continue on for hundreds of years. A process of a
&gt; government hastily volunteering a broad technology standard this early in
&gt; the computing age is probably not a wise thing. A process that involves
&gt; secret and semi-secret law enforcement agencies behind the scenes feels,
&gt; looks and smells like a very BAD THING.

Foreword <p>

The Federal Information Processing Standards Publication Series of
the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is the
official series of publications relating to standards and
guidelines adopted and promulgated under the provisions of Section
111(d) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of
1949 as amended by the Computer Security Act of 1987, Public Law
100-235.  These mandates have given the Secretary of Commerce and
NIST important responsibilities for improving the utilization and
management of computer and related telecommunications systems in
the Federal Government.  The NIST, through the Computer Systems
Laboratory, provides leadership, technical guidance, and
coordination of Government efforts in the development of standards
and guidelines in these areas. <p>

Comments concerning Federal Information Processing Standards

Abstract <p>

This standard specifies an encryption/decryption algorithm and a
Law Enforcement Access Field (LEAF) creation method which may be
implemented in electronic devices and used for protecting
government telecommunications when such protection is desired.  The
algorithm and the LEAF creation method are classified and are
referenced, but not specified, in the standard.  Electronic devices
implementing this standard may be designed into cryptographic
modules which are integrated into data security products and
systems for use in data security applications.  The LEAF is used in
a key escrow system that provides for decryption of
telecommunications when access to the telecommunications is
lawfully authorized. <p>

Announcing the <p>

Escrowed Encryption Standard (EES) <p>

Federal Information Processing Standards Publications (FIPS PUBS)
are issued by the National Institute of Standards and Technology
(NIST) after approval by the Secretary of Commerce pursuant to
Section 111(d) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services
Act of 1949 as amended by the Computer Security Act of 1987, Public
Law 100-235. <p>

Name of Standard:  Escrowed Encryption  Standard (EES). <p>

Category of Standard: Telecommunications Security. <p>

Explanation: This Standard specifies use of a symmetric-key
encryption (and decryption) algorithm (SKIPJACK) and a Law
Enforcement Access Field (LEAF) creation method (one part of a key
escrow system) which provides for decryption of encrypted
telecommunications when interception of the telecommunications is
lawfully authorized.  Both the SKIPJACK algorithm and the LEAF
creation method are to be implemented in electronic devices (e.g.,
very large scale integration chips).  The devices may be
incorporated in security equipment used to encrypt (and decrypt)
sensitive unclassified telecommunications data.  Decryption of
lawfully intercepted telecommunications may be achieved through the
acquisition and use of the LEAF,  the decryption algorithm  and
the two escrowed key components. <p>

One definition of "escrow" means that something (e.g., a document,
an encryption key)  is "delivered to a third person to be given to
the grantee only upon the fulfillment of a condition" (Webster's
Seventh New Collegiate Dictionary).  The term, "escrow", for
purposes of this standard, is restricted to this dictionary
definition. <p>

A key escrow system, for purposes of this standard,  is one that
entrusts the two components comprising  a cryptographic key (e.g.,
a device unique key) to two  key component holders (also called
"escrow agents").  In accordance with the above definition of
"escrow", the key component holders provide the components of a key
to a "grantee" (e.g., a law enforcement official) only upon
fulfillment of the condition that the grantee has properly
demonstrated legal authorization to conduct electronic surveillance
of telecommunications which are encrypted using the specific device
whose device unique key  is being requested.  The key components
obtained through this process are then used by the grantee to
reconstruct the device unique key and obtain the session key  which
is then used to  decrypt the telecommunications that are encrypted
with that session key. <p>

The SKIPJACK encryption/decryption algorithm has been approved for
government applications requiring encryption of sensitive but
unclassified data telecommunications as defined herein.  The
specific operations of the SKIPJACK algorithm and the LEAF creation
method are classified and hence are referenced, but not specified,
in this standard. <p>

Data for purposes of this standard includes voice, facsimile and
computer information communicated in a telephone system.  A
telephone system for purposes of this standard is limited to a
system which is circuit switched and operating at data rates of
standard commercial modems over analog voice circuits or which uses
basic-rate ISDN or a similar grade wireless service. <p>

Data that is considered sensitive by a responsible authority should
be encrypted if it is vulnerable to unauthorized disclosure during
telecommunications.  A risk analysis should be performed under the
direction of a responsible authority to determine potential threats
and risks.  The costs of providing encryption using this standard
as well as alternative methods and their respective costs should be
projected.  A responsible authority should then make a decision,
based on the risk and cost analyses, whether or not to use
encryption and then whether or not to use this standard. <p>

Approving Authority:  Secretary of Commerce. <p>

Maintenance Agency: Department of Commerce, National Institute of
Standards and Technology. <p>

Applicability:   This standard is applicable to all Federal
departments and agencies and their contractors under the conditions
specified below.  This standard may be used in designing and
implementing security products and systems, which Federal
departments and agencies use or operate or which are operated for
them under contract.  These products may be used when replacing
Type II and Type III (DES) encryption devices and products owned by
the government and government contractors. <p>

This standard may be used  when the following conditions apply: <p>

1.  An authorized official or manager responsible for data
security or the security of a computer system decides that
encryption is required and cost justified as per OMB Circular A-
130; and
     2.  The data is not classified according to Executive Order
12356, entitled "National Security Information," or to its
successor orders, or to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended. <p>

However, Federal departments or agencies which use encryption
devices for protecting data that is classified according to either
of these acts may use those devices also for protecting
unclassified data in lieu of this standard. <p>

In addition, this standard may be adopted and used by non-Federal
Government organizations.  Such use is encouraged when it provides
the desired security. <p>

Applications: This standard may be used in any unclassified
government and commercial communications.  Use of devices
conforming to this standard is voluntary for unclassified
government applications and for commercial security applications. <p>

Implementations:   The encryption/decryption algorithm and the LEAF
creation method shall be implemented in electronic devices (e.g.,
electronic chip packages) which are protected against unauthorized
entry, modification and reverse engineering.  Implementations which
are tested and validated by NIST will be considered as complying
with this standard.  An electronic device shall be incorporated
into a cryptographic module in accordance with FIPS 140-1.  NIST
will test for conformance with FIPS 140-1.  Conforming
cryptographic modules can then be integrated into security
equipment for sale and use in a security application.  Information
about devices that have been validated,  procedures for testing
equipment for conformance with NIST standards, and information
about approved security equipment are available from  the Computer
Systems Laboratory, NIST, Gaithersburg, MD 20899. <p>

Export Control: Implementations of this standard are subject to
Federal Government export controls as specified in Title 22, Code
of Federal Regulations, Parts 120 through 131 (International
Traffic of Arms Regulations - ITAR).  Exporters of encryption
devices, equipment and technical data are advised to contact the
U.S. Department of State, Office of Defense Trade Controls for more
information. <p>

Patents: Implementations of  this standard may be covered by U.S.
and foreign patents. <p>

Implementation Schedule: This standard becomes effective thirty
days following publication of this FIPS PUB. <p>

encryption/decryption algorithm and the LEAF creation method as
specified in this standard. <p>

Digital data - Data that have been converted to a binary
representation. <p>

Encryption - Conversion of plaintext to ciphertext through the use
of a cryptographic algorithm. <p>

Key components  - The  two values from which a key can be derived
(e.g., KU1 ~ KU2). <p>

Key escrow - The processes of managing (e.g., generating, storing,
transferring, auditing) the two components of a cryptographic key
by two key component holders. <p>

LEAF Creation Method  - A part of a key escrow system that is
implemented in a cryptographic device and creates a Law Enforcement
Access Field. <p>

by the National Security Agency for protecting sensitive
unclassified information in systems as specified in section 2315 of
Title 10 United States Code, or section 3502(2) of Title 44, United
States Code. <p>

Type III cryptography - A cryptographic algorithm or device
approved as a Federal Information Processing Standard. <p>

Type III(E) cryptography - A Type III algorithm or device that is
approved for export from the United States. <p>

Qualifications: The protection provided by a security product or

the SKIPJACK algorithm against key search attacks is greater than
that provided by the DES algorithm (e.g., the cryptographic key is
longer).  However, provisions of this standard are intended to
ensure that information encrypted through use of devices
implementing this standard can be decrypted by a legally authorized
entity. <p>

Specifications for the <p>

ESCROWED ENCRYPTION STANDARD <p>

1. INTRODUCTION <p>

This publication specifies Escrowed Encryption Standard (EES)
functions and parameters. <p>

2. GENERAL <p>

This standard specifies use of the SKIPJACK cryptographic algorithm
and a LEAF Creation Method to be implemented in an approved
electronic device (e.g., a very large scale integration electronic
chip).  The device is contained in a logical cryptographic module
which is then integrated in a  security product for encrypting and
decrypting telecommunications. <p>

Approved implementations may be procured by authorized
organizations for integration into security equipment.  Devices
must be tested and validated by NIST for conformance to this
standard.  Cryptographic modules must be tested and validated by
NIST for conformance to FIPS 140-1. <p>

3.  ALGORITHM SPECIFICATIONS <p>

The specifications of the encryption/decryption algorithm
(SKIPJACK) and LEAF Creation Method 1 (LCM-1) are classified.  The
National Security Agency maintains these classified specifications
and approves the manufacture of devices which implement the
specifications.   NIST tests for conformance of the devices
implementing this standard in cryptographic modules to FIPS 140-1
and FIPS 81. <p>

4.  FUNCTIONS  AND PARAMETERS <p>

4.1   FUNCTIONS <p>

The following functions, at a minimum, shall be implemented: <p>

1.  Data Encryption:  A session key (80 bits) shall be used to
encrypt plaintext information in one or more of the following modes
of operation as specified in FIPS 81:  ECB, CBC, OFB (64), CFB (1,
8, 16, 32, 64). <p>

2.  Data Decryption:   The session key (80 bits) used to
encrypt the data shall be used to decrypt resulting ciphertext to
obtain the data . <p>

3.  LEAF Creation:  A Family Key (e.g., KF-1) shall be used to
create a Law Enforcement Access Field (LEAF) in accordance with a
LEAF Creation Method (e.g., LCM-1).  The security equipment shall
ensure that the LEAF is transmitted in such a manner that the LEAF
and ciphertext may be decrypted with legal authorization.  No
additional encryption or modification of the LEAF is permitted. <p>

4.2  PARAMETERS <p>

The following parameters shall be used in performing the
prescribed functions: <p>

1.  Device Unique Identifier  (UID):  The identifier unique to
a particular device and used by the Key Escrow System. <p>

2.  Device Unique Key (KU):  The cryptographic key unique to
a particular device and used by the Key Escrow System. <p>

3.  Cryptographic Protocol Field (CPF):  The field identifying
the registered cryptographic protocol used by a particular
application and used by the Key Escrow System (reserved for future
specification and use). <p>

4.   Escrow Authenticator (EA):  A binary pattern that is
inserted in the LEAF to ensure that the LEAF is transmitted and
received properly and has not been modified, deleted or replaced in
an unauthorized manner. <p>

5.  Initialization Vector (IV):  A mode and application
dependent vector of bytes used to initialize, synchronize and
verify the encryption, decryption and key escrow functions. <p>

6.  Family Key (KF):  The cryptographic key stored in all
devices designated as a family that is used to create a LEAF. <p>

7.  Session Key (KS):  The cryptographic key used by a device
to encrypt and decrypt data during a session. <p>

8.   Law Enforcement Access Field (LEAF):  The field
containing the encrypted session key and the device identifier and
the escrow authenticator. <p>

5.   IMPLEMENTATION <p>

The Cryptographic Algorithm (i.e., SKIPJACK) and a LEAF Creation
Method (e.g., LCM-1) shall be implemented in an electronic device
(e.g., VLSI chip) which is highly resistant to reverse engineering
(destructive or non-destructive) to obtain or modify the
cryptographic algorithm, the UID, the KF, the KU, the EA, the CPF,
the operational KS, and any other security or Key Escrow System
relevant information.  The device shall be able to be
programmed/personalized (i.e., made unique) after mass production
in such a manner that the UID, KU (or its components), KF (or its
components) and EA fixed pattern can be entered once (and only
once) and maintained without external electrical power. <p>

The LEAF and the IV shall be transmitted with the ciphertext.  The
specifics of the protocols used to create and transmit the LEAF,
IV, and encrypted data shall be registered and a CPF assigned.  The
CPF  (and the KF-ID, LCM-ID) shall then be transmitted in
accordance with the registered specifications. <p>

Various devices implementing this standard are anticipated.  The
implementation may vary with the application.  The specific
electric, physical and logical interface will vary with the
implementation.  Each approved, registered implementation shall
have an unclassified electrical, physical and logical interface
specification sufficient for an equipment manufacturer to
understand the general requirements for using the device.  Some of
the requirements may be classified and therefore would not be
specified in the unclassified interface specification. <p>

The device Unique Key shall be composed of two components (each a
minimum of 80 bits long) and each component shall be independently
generated and stored by an escrow agent.  The session key used to
encrypt transmitted information shall be the same as the session
key used to decrypt received information in a two-way simultaneous
communication.  The Lead Creation Method (LCM), the Cryptographic
Protocol Field (CPF), and the Family Key Identifier (KF-ID) shall
be registered in the NIST Computer Security Object Register. <p>

This standard is not an interoperability standard.  It does not
provide sufficient information to design and implement a security
device or equipment.  Other specifications and standards will be
required to assure interoperability of EES devices in various
applications.  Specifications of a particular EES device must be
obtained from the manufacturer. <p>

The specifications for the SKIPJACK algorithm are contained in the
R21 Informal Technical Report entitled "SKIPJACK" (S), R21-TECH-
044-91, May 21, 1991.  The specifications for LEAF Creation Method
1 are contained in the R21 Informal Technical Report entitled "Law
Enforcement Access Field for the Key Escrow Microcircuit" (S).
Organizations holding an appropriate security clearance and
entering into a Memorandum of Agreement with the National Security
Agency regarding implementation of the standard will be provided
access to the classified specifications.   Inquiries may be made
regarding the Technical Reports and this program to Director,
National Security Agency, Fort George G. Meade, MD 20755-6000,
ATTN: R21. <p>

Dave, <p>

I don't know if you want to continue the "Rotenberg/Denning debate" on
Interesting People, but this was my response to Marc. <p>

Dorothy
--------
The following comments are in response to responses posted in RISKS 15.50
on my earlier comments: <p>

&gt;From Marc Rotenberg:
&gt;
&gt; The NSA is responsible for foreign signal interception.  It has no legal
&gt; authority to conduct wire surveillance.  What are the NSA's "national
&gt; security" interests in domestic wire surveillance?
&gt;
I do not believe that NSA has any particular interest in domestic wire
surveillance.  I expect their concern is that if a product with a very
strong algorithm such as SKIPJACK were to be manufactured without keys
being escrowed, then such products would be very attractive on the
foreign black market (presumably, such products would not be
exportable) where they could interfere with foreign intelligence.
&gt;
&gt; The FBI made certain claims that cryptography was impeding criminal
&gt; investigation conducted by wiretap.  CPSR investigated the FBI's claims by
&gt; filing a Freedom of Information Act suit to obtain the relevant documents.
&gt; The documents provided to us by the Department of Justice revealed that none
&gt; of the FBI field officers had encountered any obstacles.  The Department of
&gt; Justice has just informed us that they provided to us all relevant documents
&gt; concerning the Clipper proposal.
&gt;
In testimony before the Computer Systems Security and Privacy Advisory
Board (CSSPAB) at NIST, James Kallstrom of the FBI said that encryption
was styming the effort in more than three but less than ten of ongoing
cases.  The FBI does not give details of ongoing investigations, so this
information would not be available through FOIA. <p>

&gt; There is one reported case where cryptography made it difficult for law
&gt; enforcement to obtain evidence. That case concerned reading the contents of a
&gt; file on a hard disk after it was seized.
&gt;
&gt; If this is the problem that the Clipper proposal is intended to solve, then
&gt; the key escrow scheme must be extended to every single encrypted file -- not
&gt; just encrypted communications -- everywhere in the world.
&gt;
I've heard of 3 cases now where encrypted files could not be decrypted,
but law enforcers seem to be much more concerned about communications
than stored files.  Clipper does not address file encryption.
&gt;
&gt; An FBI legislative proposal now under consideration at the White House would
&gt; mandate a Clipper-like scheme.  That proposal is backed by fines up to $10,000
&gt; per day and jail time.
&gt;
Everything I've seen has said Clipper is voluntary.  Quoting from the standard:
"This standard does not mandate the use of escrowed encryption devices by
Federal government agencies, the private sector or other levels of government."
Dept. of Commerce, NIST, Docket No. 930659-4017, RIN 063-AB19, Approval
of FIPS 185, Escrowed Encryption Standard (EES).
&gt;
&gt; &gt;  I support this objective.  Unfortunately, it is not
&gt; &gt;  possible for most of us to be fully informed of the
&gt; &gt;  national security implications of uncontrolled
&gt; &gt;  encryption.  For very legitimate reasons, these cannot
&gt; &gt;  be fully discussed and debated in a public forum.
&gt;
&gt; This assertion has never been supported by evidence.  It has been used simply
&gt; to stifle criticism.
&gt;
Certain information relating to foreign intelligence operations is
classified.  Are you saying that decisions should not be based on
classified information or that foreign intelligence information should
not be classified?
&gt;
&gt; CPSR did not participate in the inter-agency policy review.  Our position from
&gt; the very beginning is that these decisions must be made openly.
&gt;
As part of the inter-agency review, the CSSPAB was asked to sponsor
hearings on the proposal.  These were held in June.  The testimony that
was presented was given to the government.  Marc gave a presentation
at those hearings, as did David Banisar of CPSR.  Several people in
the government who have been participating in the inter-agency review
were present at the hearings.  There have been several other forums
as well, including one sponsored by CPSR last June.  Again, several
people participating in the inter-agency review were present. <p>

&gt; &gt;  In the absence of understanding
&gt; &gt;  the national security issues, I believe we need to
&gt; &gt;  exercise some caution in believing that we can
&gt; &gt;  understand the full implications of encryption on
&gt; &gt;  society.
&gt;
&gt; This premise, if accepted, would mean that people in the United States would
&gt; have no right to express political views when the government claimed "national
&gt; security." Certainly, there are matters of national security that must be <p>

I did not mean to suggest that people should not express their views.  Being
cautious is different from being silent. <p>

As followup to what I said in RISKS, I'd like to respond to another of
Marc's comments, made in reference to the 5 of us who reviewed SKIPJACK. <p>

&gt; Dorothy endorsed the proposal before she joined the "review" team.  The
&gt; group that she refers to, a White House task force, has an interesting
&gt; history.  The majority of cryptographers asked to participate
&gt; declined. <p>

I believe that approximately half accepted. <p>

My support of Clipper is contingent on it providing a very high level
of protection, including protection against compromises or abuses of
keys.  The main reason I agreed to be a reviewer was to make sure that
the system was in fact secure.  I believe the others share my concern.
Before I supported Clipper, I already knew quite a bit about how the
whole system was going to be structured, so I felt confident that the
goal of high security would be achieved.  Nothing I have seen so far
has changed my assessment.  However, if as a result of our complete
review, I come to the conclusion that the risks of Clipper are not
acceptable, I will withdraw my support. <p>

So, you can buy a high ranking CIA person (who ran the *counter*intelligence

White House Wiretap Bill - CyberWire Dispatch <p>

CyberWire Dispatch//Copyright (c) 1994// <p>

Jacking in from the Budget Busting Port: <p>

The White House today began floating its version of the controversial
digital wiretap bill that requires all communications systems to be made
wiretap ready.  The bill has teeth.  It gives the Feds the right to shut
down any telephone, cable or computer network that fails to give law
enforcement what it wants:  Easy access to any and all conversations.  Bar
none. <p>

The new bill, a copy of which was obtained by Dispatch, is a "new and
improved" version of the fatally flawed FBI digital wiretap bill that
atrophied on Capitol Hill during the Bush Administration.  That bill was in
flames before the ink dried on the draft copies.  It mandated compliance
from industry within 120 days of passage ("fucking impossible," one
telephone executive said at the time) and required you and me to pay for
making the FBI's job easier.  "No fucking way," was the general consensus,
from industry as well as a wellspring of privacy and civil liberties
groups. <p>

The Clinton policy wonks, however, seem to be twisted students of history.
They've bought off on the general principle of the bill, but sought to take
the sting out of it.  Here's what those brilliant Thirtysomething
workaholics have decided:  They'll allow telephone companies to pay
"reasonable costs" for all software and equipment upgrades to make this
happen.  Then these phone companies can send the bill to the Feds, and
Uncle Same will pay them back all "reasonable costs" for the wiretap
access. <p>

Brilliant scheme, right?  Except, what's wrong with this picture? First,
there's absolutely no definition of reasonable cost. Second, although the
government pays for it, where the hell does the government get its funds?
That's right:  Joe and Jane Taxpayer. <p>

Or perhaps Clinton will simply cut the appropriations budget for the
Headstart Program?  Or how about trimming a few Cruise missiles from the
procurement list?  After all, as Dispatch has reported, someone is going to
have to pony up more than $1 billion for all this.  Talk about a budget
buster. <p>

Three Years or Yer Out
====================== <p>

If the bill passes, and it must first find a sponsor, industry will have 3
years to comply with its mandates.  But the heavy lifting is left to the
switch manufacturers and equipment makers. Once they get their act
together, all this software and hardware is turned over to the carriers to
install. But they have to hustle:  No grace period.  Three years, max.  And
just for comparison sake, it's taken the phone companies more than 7 years
to code in equal access dialing, a job that was supposed to take three. <p>

If that wiretap deadline isn't met, the Feds can actually shut down the
telephone network, a cable system or even computer networks like
CompuServe.  That aspect of the bill is "unconstitutional," says Jerry
Berman, director of Washington office for the Electronic Frontier
Foundation.  "Injunction power over communications of the U.S. is a prior
restraint and far too broad under the First Amendment," he said. <p>

And if those sexy digital calling features such as call forwarding or ISDN
applications foil the Feds *at all* they can demand that those services be
*shut down* until they are brought into compliance.  Oh yeah, and while all
that complying is going on, the telephone companies get kicked in the ass
to the tune of $10,000 per day.  That's the motivation factor. <p>

Senator Patrick Leahy said Congress "wants to ensure that the
Administration's law enforcement goals are met."  However, that can't be
played off other concerns.  "We can't jeopardize the legitimate concerns of
business by empowering the attorney general to have the final say in how
far and how fast technology advances," he said. <p>

Of course, there's the National Security Agency to deal with here too, but
nobody's saying a damn thing about them.  The NSA, however, had a direct
hand in helping craft this bill. <p>

The White House meets Thursday with industry officials to break the news to
them.  The Administration will trot out the FBI to give its usually dog and
pony show rap that "we need to stop child pornographers" so pass this bill.
White House meetings with privacy and civil liberty groups takes place on
Friday. Stay tuned... <p>

Meeks out... <p>

Possibly compromised account <p>

Date: Thu, 24 Feb 94 13:08:50 -0500
From: shap@viper.cis.upenn.edu (Jonathan Shapiro)
To: farber@central.cis.upenn.edu

Subject: Possibly compromised account <p>

This is to alert you to the possibility that Dorothy Denning's login
may have been compromised. <p>

In a recent mailing to the "interesting people" list, a party alleging
to be Dorothy Denning made a number of statements in support of the
SkipJack initiative that were erroneous or deliberately misleading.
The suspect in question makes remarkably subtle use of misdirection to
twist the facts of the case.  This is not consistent with the sort of
integrity one expects from Dorothy's statements. <p>

In order that you will be able to spot future mailings from this
unknown party, I will point them out. <p>

[Suspect] <p>

I expect their [the NSA's] concern is that if a product with a very
   strong algorithm such as SKIPJACK were to be manufactured without keys
   being escrowed, then such products would be very attractive on the
   foreign black market (presumably, such products would not be
   exportable) where they could interfere with foreign intelligence. <p>

Note the subtle misdirection embedded in the words "I suspect."  The
author wishes you to believe that the stated position is the NSA
position, and is distracting attention from the fact that they are
supporting the opinion by promulgating it. <p>

The position described is ludicrous.  It says that the focus market
for SkipJack-derived systems is characterized as follows: <p>

1) Customer is a criminal or terrorist. <p>

2) Customer trusts the NSA, and all organizations that
           NSA collaborates with, either officially or covertly,
           legally or otherwise. <p>

3) Aside from the fact that they are a criminal or a
           terrorist, customer is basically law abiding, and
           therefore will not use some other encryption
           algorithm as a substitute or layered on top of SkipJack. <p>

4) Customer is smarter than your average turnip, which
           is why we need to tap their phones in order to catch them. <p>

No question that I'ld choose SkipJack for all of my illegal and/or
terrorist activities.  I'll hop right out and buy one. <p>

&gt; An FBI legislative proposal now under consideration at the White
   &gt; House would mandate a Clipper-like scheme.  That proposal is
   &gt; backed by fines up to $10,000 per day and jail time. <p>

[Suspect] <p>

Everything I've seen has said Clipper is voluntary.  Quoting from
   the standard: "This standard does not mandate the use of escrowed
   encryption devices by Federal government agencies, the private
   sector or other levels of government." <p>

Note that the suspect has not responded to the issue at hand.
Standards are not legally binding, so it would hardly matter if the
NIST standard mandated SkipJack.  FBI legislative proposals, on the
other hand, stand a disturbing chance of becoming law. <p>

[Suspect] <p>

Before I supported Clipper, I already knew quite a bit about how the
   whole system was going to be structured, so I felt confident that the
   goal of high security would be achieved.  Nothing I have seen so far
   has changed my assessment. <p>

I encourage you all to take a few minutes to browse the CPSR and/or
EFF FTP archives.  It has some fascinating material obtained from the
allegedly secure contractor whose job is to produce the keys. <p>

Dorothy Denning's reputation is one of integrity.  Clearly, the
comments above could not have originated with her. <p>

It's an interesting question, however, to ask who is employing the
suspect. <p>

Jonathan <p>

SkipJack.  Because We're Not Listening. <p>

While it is much like a advertisement, it is of interest  AT&amp;T SecretAgent 3.0 <p>

From: darneke@attmail.com (David R Arneke)

AT&amp;T ADDS RSA SECURITY TECHNOLOGY TO SECRETAGENT (TM) SOFTWARE <p>

GREENSBORO, North Carolina -- AT&amp;T has added RSA security
technology to its SecretAgent software in an upgrade that makes the
program more versatile, easier to use and faster. <p>

Other major new capabilities in AT&amp;T SecretAgent Version 3.0
include: <p>

-- User-transparent support of RSA and DSA public keys.  Users
can generate RSA keys or DSA keys and communicate signed and encrypted
messages with other SecretAgent 3.0 users regardless of their choice
of public key algorithms. <p>

-- Cross-platform compatibility among MS-DOS, Windows,
Macintosh and various UNIX operating systems.  Information secured on
one operating system can be processed transparently on any of the
others. <p>

-- Mail-enabled operation through the widely supported
Vendor-Independent Messaging (VIM) interface. <p>

-- Significantly faster implementation of DES encryption and
DSA signing and validation. <p>

Version 3.0 adds the RSA cryptosystem for digital signatures
and key management to SecretAgent's capabilities, which already
included DES encryption, the NIST Digital Sig- nature Algorithm (DSA)
and the federal Secure Hash Standard (SHS) for data integrity. <p>

For encryption and DSA signatures, a variant of the
Diffie-Hellman protocol is used for key exchange. <p>

"AT&amp;T SecretAgent 3.0 Software gives users a more powerful
array of capabilities in an extremely fast and efficient way," said
William A. Franklin, software security products manager, AT&amp;T Secure
Communications Systems. <p>

With its unique combination of standards, SecretAgent 3.0
software provides solutions to the security requirements of a wide
variety of business and government users. <p>

"Some customers require only one set of capabilities --
government users, for example, are required to use federal standards
only," Franklin said. <p>

"Some businesses prefer RSA technology, but others need RSA
for electronic data interchange with other commercial businesses and
government standards for dealing with the government." <p>

Users can select either RSA, SHS and DES or DSA, SHS, DES and
Diffie-Hellman for signing and encrypting.  On reception, the program
detects which security algorithms have been used so the recipient of a
message doesn't have to be concerned about which technology the sender
used. <p>

Mail-enabled operation also makes security user-friendly.
Messages can be created, signed, encrypted and mailed all without
leaving SecretAgent 3.0 software.  Documents also can be signed,
encrypted and transmitted as mail attachments. <p>

DES encryption is 50 percent faster than in the original
version of AT&amp;T SecretAgent Software. <p>

Digital signature speed is also improved.  DSA signing
and validation are performed in approximately 150 milliseconds each
on a 486/33M Hz personal computer. <p>

AT&amp;T SecretAgent Software was developed for AT&amp;T by
Information Security Corporation of Deerfield, Illinois. <p>

The program operates independently of word processing
programs, enabling it to safeguard such diverse data as text files,
spreadsheets and databases. <p>

SecretAgent 3.0 software encrypts and decrypts files for
transmissions or storage, even files stored on a shared network hard
disk. <p>

Single-copy suggested retail price is $329.95 for the DOS and
Windows versions, $359.95 for the Mac version and $399.95 for the UNIX
version.  Volume discounts and site/enterprise licensing are
available. <p>

Recommended PC configuration includes 640 KB RAM (256 KB
required) and hard disk. <p>

The Windows version of SecretAgent 3.0 software will be
available March 15.  The DOS version will follow on April 1, the
SPARCstation UNIX version on April 15 and the Mac version on May 1. <p>

A software upgrade to allow the program to accept the federal
government's TESSERA PCMCIA card and DATAKEY Sig- naSURE smart card
will be available April 1.  A triple-DES software capability also will
be available April 1. <p>

&gt;writes, quoting NIST:
&gt;
&gt;|&gt;                    They found that the algorithm provides
&gt;|&gt; significant protection and that it will be 36 years until the cost
&gt;|&gt; of breaking the EES algorithm will be equal to the cost of breaking
&gt;|&gt; the current Data Encryption Standard. <p>

&gt;  This is meaningless.  Could someone please make a more meaningful
&gt;comparison of EES with Triple DES or IDEA?  DES is clearly out of date.
&gt;Oh, I forgot, we're not allowed to see the EES. :-) <p>

You don't need to see EES for this "expert computation". <p>

Processor speeds double every 1.5 years (thanks to chip technology
improvements -- also affecting speed of Wiener's chips). <p>

Brute force attack of Clipper's 80-bit keys takes 2^(80-56) times as
many trials.  If you want to wait until chip technology makes that as
fast as current DES breaking, you need to wait  (80-56)*1.5 years. <p>

Triple DES (of the form ECB|ECB|ECB) with three independent keys has
3*56 bits of key and it will take (3*56-80)*1.5 years before you can
break triple-DES in the same time you break Clipper today. <p>

IDEA has a 128-bit key, so it will take (128-80)*1.5 years before
you can break IDEA in the same time as you could break Clipper today. <p>

If you want brute force protection, of course, you can use my <p>

DES|TRAN|nDES|TRAN|DES          (call it DTnDTD) <p>

suggestion from a day or two ago (on sci.crypt) and get ((n+2)*56-80)*1.5
years lead on Clipper -- practical for n up to about 500, given today's
message sizes. <p>

Summary: <p>

to break X in the same time (cost) as breaking Clipper today,
        you need to wait: <p>

X               time <p>

DES             - 36 years
        IDEA            72 years
        triple-DES      132 years
        (DTnDTD, n=16)  1392 years <p>

Meanwhile, I would *far* prefer single DES over Clipper, to protect against
organized crime attacks on my privacy.  I don't believe OrgCrime would be
able to build a Wiener machine (or better) and get known plaintext from my
traffic without a huge ramp-up time in staffing and research -- but
stealing keys, bribing escrow agents, etc., is something OrgCrime is
already very skilled at. <p>

Section-by-section Analysis of the 1994 draft of the Digital Telephony  legislation by EFF Staff  [ people I have sent this to found it very interesting, I hope you do also .. djf] <p>

Section-by-section Analysis of the 1994 draft of the Digital Telephony
legislation <p>

Mike Godwin
EFF <p>

TITLE <p>

&gt;A BILL <p>

&gt;To ensure continued law enforcement electronic surveillance access to the
content of wire and electronic communications and call setup information
when authorized by law, to improve communications privacy protection, and
for other purposes. <p>

The "other purposes" are, apparently, the correction of a drafting error
in ECPA that led to an anomaly in 18 USC 2511. See Section 4 below. <p>

SECTION 2 <p>

&gt;SEC. 2. PURPOSE. The purpose of this Act is to clarify and define the
responsibilities of common carriers, providers of common carrier support
services, and telecommunications equipment manufacturers to provide the
assistance required to ensure that government agencies can implement
court
&gt;orders and lawful authorizations to intercept the content of wire and
electronic communications and acquire call setup information under
chapters 119 and 206 of title 18 and chapter 36 of title 50. <p>

Chapter 119 is the communications-interception chapter, commonly called
"Title III."
Chapter 206 is the pen-register/trap-and-trace chapter. Title 50 includes
interception provisions of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. <p>

Note that Chapter 121 of Title 18, the stored-communications chapter of
the U.S. criminal code, is not mentioned. It may, however, be affected by
some of the amendments suggested in the Digital Telephony bill. <p>

&gt;Otherwise,
&gt;except for the provisions in section 4, nothing in this Act is intended
to
&gt;alter any provision contained in the Federal electronic surveillance, pen
register, or trap and trace statutes, or those of any state or other
jurisdiction. In particular, nothing herein is intended to enlarge or
reduce the government's authority to lawfully intercept the content of
communications or install or use pen register or trap and trace devices,
or to increase or decrease any criminal penalties for unlawfully
intercepting the content of communications or installing or using pen
register or trap and trace devices, or to alter the provisions regarding
service provider assistance, payment for assistance, causes of action,
civil liability, or good faith defenses. <p>

This is essentially a deceptive statement about the effect of the Act.
Although 18 USC 2518(4) allows applicants for authorization orders to
request that the order "direct that a provider of wire or electronic
communication service ... furnish the applicant forthwith with all
information, facilities, and technical assistance necessary to accomplish
the interception...", this provision has not widely been interpreted to
hold that service providers must actively create solutions to interception
problems if those solutions do not already exist. The FBI analysis says
government agencies "have been reluctant to pursue contempt or other legal
remedies to resolve this issue." The reason for this reluctance, in my
opinion, is that the language of 2518(4) does not unequivocally impose
such a burden on providers, and the government stands a good chance of
losing any fight in which it claims that such a burden does exist. <p>

Thus, the FBI's solution is to create a *new* and *routine* obligation on
common carriers (but not small-scale providers) to generate technical
solutions to interception and "call setup" problems created by current
common-carrier networks. Moreover, this Act would require that common
carriers make manpower available on a 24-hour basis to handle
interceptions and the capture of call-setup information in the event of a
wiretap or pen-register/trap-and-trace order. <p>

The FBI analysis asserts without quantification that "since the mid-1980s,
technological impediments have frustrated, in whole or in part, the
execution of a number of court orders." But among the "technological
impediments," apparently, has been the reluctance or inability of common
carriers to provide the kind of assistance that law
enforcement--specifically, guaranteed ability to capture communications
contents and "call setup" information. <p>

The Act and the FBI analysis consistently use the language of
"clarification" in reference to the amendments contained in the Act, but
of course the vastly expanded authority of the Attorney General and the
FCC to supervise and punish common carriers is nothing if not "expanded
authority." This Act also creates many new legal obligations for common
carriers, "support services," and telecom equipment manufacturers. <p>

&gt;The Act is further intended to improve communications privacy protection
for cordless telephones, certain radio-based data communications and
networks, communications transmitted using certain privacy-enhancing
modulation techniques, and to clarify the lawfulness of quality control
and service provision monitoring of electronic communications. <p>

These are all addressed in Section 4 of the Act. This section corrects
four anomalies under the current statutes: 1) It brings cordless
telephones under the protection of Title III. 2) With respect to radio
communications it creates Title III protection for "an electronic
communication" that is transmitted via radio. 3) It corrects an apparent
omission by adding radio communications that use "modulation techniques"
for privacy to the interception penalty provisions of 18 USC 2511(4).
4) It corrects a drafting error in ECPA by adding "electronic
communication" to a clause in 18 USC 2511 (2)(a)(i). <p>

&gt;SEC. 3. COMMON CARRIER ASSISTANCE <p>

&gt;(a) _New section_. Chapter 109 of title 18, United States Code, is
amended by adding the following new section: <p>

&gt;"Sec. 2237. Common carrier assistance to government agencies.
""(a) Assistance requirements. Common carriers shall be required to
provide forthwith, pursuant to court order or lawful authorization, the
following capabilities and capacities in order to permit the government
to
&gt;conduct electronic surveillance and pen register and trap and trace
investigations effectively: <p>

Note that Chapter 109 is not part of Title III; instead, it's a chapter
including various penalty provisions for interference in the execution of
lawful searches and seizures and for violating the Constitutionally
mandated requirements for such procedures. The chapter is does not amount
to a statutory scheme--it's basically a collection of somewhat related
individual search-and-seizure statutes. <p>

Why isn't this Act part of Title III? Perhaps because it uses a different
definition of "intercept" than is used in the wiretap statute. See
discussion below. <p>

This Section of the Act outlines and specifies just what the government
wants the phrase "information, facilities, technical assistance" in 18 USC
2518 to mean. Note that a major component of these obligations is the
requirement that common carriers *create* new information and facilities
and devise new means of technical assistance. <p>

The FBI analysis makes clear that the drafters of this Act developed a
wish list in consultation with other federal, state, and local
law-enforcement agencies. Although the FBI analysis states that "The
Government intentionally eschewed setting any technical standards because
it does not desire to 'dictate' particular technological solutions, it is
apparent that the government hopes to gain the authority to dictate
*functional* solutions. Given the penalties for noncompliance and other
enforcement powers this Act creates, "dictate" is not too strong a verb
for the kind of prerogative the government is seeking. <p>

&gt;"(1) The ability to execute expeditiously and simultaneously within a
common carrier's system all court orders and lawful authorizations for the
interception of wire and electronic communications and the
acquisition
&gt;of call setup information related to the facilities or services of
subscribers of such common carrier; <p>

Note that in this iteration of the Act, there is a new emphasis on "call
setup information," which is, basically, origination and destination
information for wire or electronic communications. It has been claimed by
law enforcement that such current features as call forwarding often thwart
their ability to implement wiretaps, pen registers, or traps and traces.
This Act, if passed, would require common carriers to redesign calling
features if necessary to be ble to provide "call setup" information, or,
in the alternative, to cease providing calling features that thwarted the
capture of such transactional information. <p>

It is unclear how such a requirement would play out in cases where
communications are transmitted using both common carriage networks and
enhanced service providers. On its face, the statute may require that a
common carrier be able, for example, to tell not only which subscriber is
sending e-mail over the phone lines to the CompuServe Packet Network, but
also where that e-mail's ultimate destination is. <p>

The FBI analysis stresses that common carriers can perform a capacity
analysis, based on their prior records of assisted intercepts, etc., to
determine how much wiretap capacity to provide in order to minimize the
costs of compliance. The FBI claims that "a number of court orders and
authorizations were not fully executed, or were not even sought" because
of "capacity shortfalls, such as insufficient 'port' capacity in the
cellular mobile switching offices." The FBI analysis states that "at any
particular time, a number of Federal, state, and local government agencies
may be competing" for capacity, and that "it is critical that there be
sufficient capacity to accommodate completely the concomitant needs of all
government agencies." <p>

&gt;"(2) the ability to intercept the content of communications and acquire
call setup information concurrent with the transmission of the
communication to or from the subscriber's facility or service that is the
subject of the court order or lawful authorization, to the exclusion of
any wire or electronic communication or call setup information of any
other subscriber, notwithstanding the mobile nature of the facility or
service that is the subject of the court order or lawful authorization or
the use by the subscriber who is the subject of the court order or lawful
authorization of any features offered by the common carrier; <p>

This section requires that common carriers, including cellular and any
other mobile-phone service, be able to single out individual
communications and capture both contents and call-setup information, that
they be able to do this "live," or else immediately after the
transmission, with a preference for the former. This is the meaning of
"concurrent." <p>

The FBI analysis justifies this requirement in terms of "minimization" of
intrusion on the communications of innocent parties; of course, the
requirement would enhance the efficiency and speed with which the
government could effect a wiretap. <p>

&gt;"(3) the ability to intercept the content of communications and acquire
call setup information unobtrusively and with a minimum of interference
with any subscriber's telecommunications service; and <p>

No strange clicking on the line, in other words. <p>

&gt;"(4) the ability to receive, in a generally available format, the
intercepted content of communications and acquired call setup information
at a location identified by the government distant from the facility that
is the subject of the interception, from the interception access point,
and from the premises of the common carrier (except where emergency or
exigent circumstances such as those described in 18 U.S.C. 2518(7),
2518(11)(b), or 3125, or in 50 U.S.C. 1805(e), necessitate monitoring at
the common carrier's premises). <p>

Not only must communications and call-setup info be captured "live" or
immediately post-transmission, but it also must be routable to a remote,
designated government-operated location. Whether the routing is done by
the carrier or the government is unclear. <p>

The exceptions to this "routability requirement" occur when a criminal or
intelligence emergency pre-empts the normal process of seeking an order,
or when there is an attempt by the person committing an offense to thwart
interception by changing facilities. These types of situations are
provided for under current law. <p>

&gt;"(b) Systems security. The government shall notify a common carrier of
any interception of wire or electronic communications or any acquisition
of call setup information that is to be effected within the premises of
such common carrier pursuant to court order or lawful authorization. After
notification, such common carrier shall designate an individual or
individuals to activate such interception or acquisition forthwith. Such
individual(s) shall be available at all times to activate such
interceptions or acquisitions. Such interceptions or acquisitions effected
within the premises of a common carrier may be activated only by the
affirmative intervention of such individual(s) designated by such common
carrier. <p>

The FBI analysis justifies this "drafting" of personnel as a way of
mollifying common carriers who don't want non-personnel handling their
equipment or operating their facilities. Of course, this section also
means that a common carrier must budget for such personnel to be at the
service of law enforcement for on-premises intercepts and call-setup
captures. <p>

&gt;"(c) Compliance date. To the extent that common carriers providing
service within the United States currently cannot fulfil the requirements
set forth in subsection (a) of this section, they shall fulfil such
requirements within three years from the date of enactment of this Act. <p>

The time limit for compliance has not changed since the last iteration of
the Act. <p>

Note that only large-scale communications providers are included in the
scope of this version of the Act. The FBI analysis states that PBXs,
computer-network providers, and other entities that do not qualify as
common carriers are not to be obligated by the passage of this act to add
these new capabilities, but will be obligated to cooperate under the
general provisions of 18 USC 2518(4) to the extent possible. *Note
especially that this distinction undercuts the claim that the government
is merely "clarifying" a pre-existing obligation under 18 USC 2518(4)--if
that were true, these clarifications would apply to *all* "providers of
wire or electronic communications services" and not just "common
carriers."* <p>

&gt;"(d) Cooperation of support service providers and equipment
manufacturers. Common carriers shall consult, as necessary, in a timely
fashion with appropriate providers of common carrier support services and
telecommunications equipment manufacturers for the purpose of identifying
any services or equipment, including hardware and software, that may
require modification so as to permit compliance with the provisions of
this Act. A provider of common carrier support services or a
telecommunications equipment manufacturer shall make available to a
common
&gt;carrier on a timely and priority basis, and at a reasonable cost, any
support service or equipment, including hardware or software, which may
be
&gt;required so as to permit compliance with the provisions of this Act. <p>

This section imposes an obligation on common carriers to instruct support
services and equipment providers that they need "wiretap-friendly"
services and equipment, and it imposes an obligation on the service and
equipment providers to comply. <p>

Note that the statute does not itself outline remedies for noncompliance
by support services and equipment providers. The FBI analysis, however,
states that the Attorney General "may apply for an order, such as a writ
of mandamus" mandating the compliance of such entities. <p>

&gt;"(e) Enforcement. The Attorney General shall have authority to enforce
the provisions of subsections (a), (b), (c), and (d) of this section. The
Attorney General may apply to the appropriate United States District Court
for an order restraining or enjoining the provision of service of any
common carrier who violates subsection (a), (b), (c), or (d) of this
section. The District Courts shall have jurisdiction to issue such
restraining order or injunction. The Attorney General may also request the
Federal Communications Commission to assist in enforcing the provisions of
this Act. <p>

The "may apply" language implies that this is not an exhaustive list of
the remedies available to the Attorney General, who is granted general
"authority to enforce." <p>

In the first version of this Act, enforcement authority was to be given to
the FCC; in the second version, enforcement was the responsibility of the
Attorney General and the DOJ. This section apparently combines the best of
both worlds, empowering either the FCC or the AG to enforce the Act's
provisions. <p>

&gt;"(f) Penalties. Any common carrier that violates any provision of
subsection (a) of this section shall be subject to a civil penalty of
$10,000 per day for each day in violation. The Attorney General may file
a
&gt;civil action in the appropriate United States District Court to collect,
and the United States District Courts shall jurisdiction to impose, such
penalties. After consultation with the Attorney General, the Federal
Communications Commission may also impose regulatory sanctions or fines
otherwise authorized by law. <p>

Essentially, this section allows non-compliant common carriers to be
challenged on two fronts. <p>

&gt;"(g) Consultation. The Attorney General is encouraged to consult with the
Federal Communications Commission and common carrier representatives and
to utilize common carrier standards bodies, associations, or other such
organizations to discuss details of the requirements, such as those
related to capacity, in order to facilitate compliance with the provisions
of this Act. <p>

This language apparently is merely precatory; apparently, the Attorney
General need not consult with the FCC or the other entities mentioned here. <p>

&gt;"(h) Funding. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Federal
Communications Commission shall implement promptly methods and procedures
that allow each common carrier to be remunerated by the
Federal
&gt;Government for all reasonable costs incurred in the course of complying
with the requirements of this Act. <p>

We may reasonably anticipate that there would be significant litigation on
the issue of remuneration for "reasonable costs." <p>

&gt;"(i) Definitions. -- As used in this Section --
((1) 'common carrier' means any person or entity engaged as a common
carrier for hire, as defined by section 3(h) of the Communications Act of
1934, and includes a commercial mobile service or interconnected service,
as defined in section 6002(b) of Public Law 103-66;
((2) 'provider of common carrier support services' means any person or
entity who provides services to a common carrier that are integral to
processing, directing, forwarding, or completing telephone calls or
electronic communication transmissions;
((3) 'wire communication' shall have the same meaning as set forth in
subsection 2510(1) of title 18, United States Code;
((4) 'electronic communication' shall have the same meaning as set forth
in subsection 2510(12) of title 18, United States Code;
((5) 'intercept' shall have the same meaning as set forth in subsection
2510(4) of title 18, United States Code, except that with regard to a
common carrier's transmission of a communication encrypted by a
subscriber, the common carrier shall not be responsible for ensuring
the
&gt;government agency's ability to acquire the plaintext of the
communications
&gt;content, unless the encryption was provided by the common carrier and the
common carrier possesses the information necessary to decrypt the
communication; <p>

Normally, "intercept" means capture the contents of a communication. 18
USC 2510(4). But the government here is exempting common carriers from
providing the plaintext versions of encrypted communications that were
encrypted be the subscriber through some method other than an encryption
service offered by the common carrier and to which the carrier retains the
encryption keys or some equivalent capability to decrypt the
communications. <p>

Interestingly, this definition seems to gut the meaning of the definition
in 18 USC 2510(4), which focuses only on the content of the communication.
"Interception" legally means "capturing the content" in Title III. If
you're not capturing the content, it's not, strictly speaking, an
interception according the statutory definition. <p>

&gt;(6) 'concurrent with the transmission of the communication,' as used in
section 3(a)(2) of this Act, means contemporaneous with the transmission;
but it shall include, with regard to electronic communications, the
ability of a government agency to acquire such communications at the
conclusion of the transmission, and, with regard to call set up
information, the ability to acquire such information either before,
during, or immediately after the transmission of the communication; <p>

The FBI analysis states that law enforcement's preference is for such
information to be captured *before* transmission. <p>

&gt;(7) 'call set up information' shall mean the information generated which
identifies the origin and destination of a wire or electronic
communication placed to, or received by, the facility or service that is
the subject of a court order or lawful authorization, including
information associated with any telecommunication system
dialing
&gt;or calling features or services; and <p>

This provision would create an immensely powerful tool for message traffic
analysis, which has significance wholly independent of the ability to
capture the content of communications. <p>

The government's prerogative to capture such transactional information is
conditioned on a much lower standard of proof than that for
wiretaps--rather than making a showing of probable cause, the government
need only "certify" to the issuing magistrate that "the information likely
to be obtained by such installation and use is relevant to an ongoing
criminal investigation." 18 USC 3123. <p>

&gt;(8) 'government' means the Government of the United States and any agency
or instrumentality thereof, the District of Columbia, any commonwealth,
territory or possession of the United States, and any state or political
subdivision thereof authorized by law to conduct electronic surveillance." <p>

This simply makes clear that the prerogative to require these new services
from common carriers extends to all levels of law enforcement, and not
just to the federal law-enforcement and intelligence agencies. <p>

&gt;SEC. 4. COMMUNICATIONS PRIVACY IMPROVEMENT AND MONITORING CLARIFICATION. <p>

&gt;Chapter 119 of title 18 is amended by making the following changes: (1)
Cordless telephones.
&gt;(a) _Definitions_. - Section 2510 of title 18, United States Code, is
amended -
&gt;(1) in paragraph (1), by striking ", but such term does not include" and
all that follows through "base unit"; and
((2) in paragraph (12), by striking subparagraph (A) and redesignating
subparagraphs (B) through (D) as subparagraphs (A) through (C),
respectively.
&gt;(b) _Penalty_. - Section 2511 of title 18, United States Code, is amended
-
&gt;(1) in subsection (4)(b)(i), by inserting "a cordless telephone
communication that is transmitted between a cordless telephone handset
and
&gt;the base unit," after "cellular telephone communication,"; and
((2) in subsection (4)(b)(ii), by inserting "a cordless
telephone
&gt;communication that is transmitted between a cordless telephone handset
and
&gt;the base unit," after "cellular telephone communication,". <p>

In the early days of cordless telephones, it was easy for the radio
transmissions between handsets and base units to be intercepted by
scanners and, occasionally, by ordinary transistor radios. Congress did
not want to felonize such trivially easy interceptions. Current cordless
phone technology, however, makes such interceptions more difficult,
according to the FBI analysis, and therefore it makes sense to extend
wiretap protections to cordless phones. <p>

Note that this would resolve a long-standing anomaly in the protections
offered by Title III. <p>

&gt;(2) Radio based data communications.
&gt;Section 2510(16) of title 18, United States Code, is amended by striking
the word "or" at the end of subparagraph (D) and inserting an "or" at the
end of subparagraph (E) and adding the following new subparagraph:
&gt;"(F) an electronic communication;". <p>

This adds "electronic communications" (such as e-mail or data
communications) to the class of radio communications whose privacy is
protected by Title III. The FBI analysis states that this amendment is
designed to make clear that data communications over radio are also
protected under Title III. <p>

&gt;(3) Penalties for monitoring radio communications that are not scrambled,
encrypted, or non-public.
&gt;Section 2511(4)(b) of title 18, United States Code, is amended by
deleting the phrase "or encrypted, then--" and inserting the following:
"", encrypted, or transmitted using modulation techniques whose essential
parameters have been withheld from the public with the
intention
&gt;of preserving the privacy or such communication, then--". <p>

This amendment adds a penalty for modulation-protected communications,
which are already defined as not "readily accessible to the general
public" under the current language of 18 USC 2510(16)(B). <p>

&gt;(4)Technical correction.
&gt;Section 2511(2)(a)(i) of title 18, United States Code, is amended
by
&gt;striking out "used in the transmission of wire communication" and
inserting in lieu thereof "used in the transmission of a wire or
electronic communication.". <p>

This simply corrects a drafting error left over from the Electronic
Communications Privacy Act, by adding the term "electronic communications"
to those communications that a provider can intercept or disclose in the
course of protecting its service. The amended section already included the
language "provider of wire or electronic communications service," but
seemed to allow only the interception and disclosure of "wire
communications." <p>

How to MacPGP: <p>

You can get the PGP FAQ in four parts from Netcom also, in /pub/gbe. <p>

-=Xenon=- &lt;qwerty@netcom.com&gt; <p>

Note: Don't try to get MacPGP from the ftp site soda.berkeley.edu, since
it is mislabelled as being a Mac BinHex file, but it happens to also
be Unix gzipped, without being labelled as such (no .gz at the end). They are
being slow about fixing this. <p>

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE----- <p>

Hey Mac user you're sending e-mail on "postcards" if you don't have PGP.
You heard about it in the news; here's.... <p>

How to MacPGP:
Version 2.5 (Feb. 7, '94) <p>

PGP will encrypt files so not even crazy people with supercomputers can
decrypt them. You write e-mail on a word processor, encrypt it using a
someone's public key, and send it off. They use their private key to
decrypt it. Public keys are just that; give yours out freely. Once a person
encrypts a message with your public key, not even they can read it again.
Only you, using your private key. Phil Zimmerman's PGP is the grassroots
alternative to the Clipper Chip, which gives the government your secret
key. I will send the PGP FAQ and this guide to anyone who sends mail to
qwerty@netcom.com with Subject "Bomb me!". <p>

[Non-Mac users: READ THIS, and the "PGP FAQ" by Gary B. Edstrom (available
on alt.security.pgp or ftp to netcom.com in /pub/gbe in parts as
pgpfq*.asc)! A beginner's guide like this one by Out and About
&lt;an50928@anon.penet.fi&gt; called "DOS PGP Guide" exists (ftp to ftp.eff.org
in /pub/EFF/Policy/Crypto as pgpstart.tutorial). Answers to questions (not
in the FAQ) are available on the Usenet group alt.security.pgp. If you
don't have Usenet, mail questions to alt.security.pgp@news.cs.indiana.edu
(or @anon.penet.fi) and ask for e-mailed replies. There are versions for
DOS (and friendly add-on interfaces), Windows, Unix, VAX/VMS, Atari ST,
Amiga, OS/2, Archimedes and others. Get "The Big Dummy's Guide to the
Internet" as shown below.] <p>

Get a Unix e-mail account (student or commercial) with internet access, and
a modem. GET A COPY OF THE FREE MAC PROGRAM STUFFIT EXPANDER (you NEED it,
not just BinHex!). Log into your e-mail account. If you are stuck in a
menu-driven place, figure out how to "escape to Unix" which will give you a
$ or % prompt. Welcome to the internet. Let's find PGP. Type 'telnet
archie.internic.net', login as 'archie', and type 'prog macpgp2.3'. A list
of sites around the world having PGP will appear. Type 'bye'. What it gave
me was, <p>

This archie server is fast, rarely overloaded, but limited. Another is
archie.sura.net. Trying this site may fail but gives a list of other sites
(and a hint to try 'qarchie' at this site). Do archies at night (same for
ftp). You want a macpgp2.3 that ends in .hqx (or try leaving out the .gz
when you do 'get' below, OR use 'binary' instead of 'ascii' below, then
'gunzip macpgp2.3.cpt.hqx.gz' in your account). Hqx (BinHex) is a way to
code Mac stuff as text. The .cpt is a Mac compression method, as are .sit
or .sea. The lists from other servers will be longer. I will use the above
macpgp2.3.cpt.hqx at site isy.liu.se as an EXAMPLE. <p>

Type 'ftp isy.liu.se', login as 'anonymous' and use an e-mail address as
the password. For fun type 'ls -l'. You are in their hard disk's main
directory and this is what's on it. Lines starting with 'd' are directories
that you can move into using 'cd' ('cd ..' to backup). (During ftp use 'get
filename "|more"' if you want to read a text file called "filename"; 'q' to
stop). Based on the archie search, type 'cd /pub/misc/pgp/2.3A', and again
'ls -l'. There it is! Type 'ascii', 'get macpgp2.3.cpt.hqx', and wait; it
is being transferred to your account. When you get the ftp&gt; prompt type
'bye'. Back to e-mail and the hard part. Type 'ls -l' to see it. <p>

Find out how to DOWNLOAD a text file from your account to your desktop.
[Try 'kermit', 'set file type text', 'send macpgp2.3.cpt.hqx', and initiate
a receive in your software (set to do kermit transfers). Or 'sz
macpgp2.3.cpt.hqx' (with software set to zmodem)]. Drag this file onto the
icon of Stuffit Expander. MacPGP2.3 will appear. In your account 'rm
macpgp2.3.cpt.hqx' will remove it. <p>

You naughty thing. PGP on another Mac. Print the documentation. It is
indeed cryptic. Better is the help feature of MacPGP2.3 itself, which is
also printable. Start PGP. Make yourself a public/private key pair with
'Generate key', select '1024' ("slow" is only key generation), leave the
'17' alone, and enter a name. Your secret key is really a long file that
you will never have to manually type in, but you have to remember a "pass
phrase" to use it (and keep others from using it if they steal your secret
key). Check 'Show pass phrase' and enter a very memorable, very obscure
sentence. Don't use all normal words! Make up tricks like "Pile?driver" or
"Here1we2go3you2stupid1bozo." Type away as requested to make some random
numbers. Wait. You can see your public key with 'View keyring' on
pubring.pgp. DON'T FORGET YOUR PASS PHRASE! Writing it down is better than
a slight chance of forgetting it. <p>

Sign your own key to prevent others from changing its ID: 'Certify key',
select pubring.pgp, select your own key, and again your own key. This is
also how you sign other people's public keys [then extract it as shown
below to send to them, so they can add ('Add keys') your signature to their
public key]. Once you have a circle of friends who have signed each other's
keys, you have a trusted network. If someone mails you a key signed by
someone in this network, you can better trust it. There is no way for
someone to forge your friend's signature on that key unless they stole your
friend's secret key AND knows its pass phrase. [You need the public key of
a friend to verify ('Check signatures') a signature they have placed on a
key.] <p>

Write some e-mail on a word processor and save it ('Save As') to the
desktop as TEXT ONLY (ascii) and close its window. Do 'Encrypt/Sign' on the
file. Double click on the public key you want to encrypt it with (for now
your own) and hit 'OK'. Check 'Treat source as text', 'Produce output in
ASCII format', and hit 'OK'. A file ending in .asc will be made. Don't let
the icon fool you; this is a simple text file that you can open with a word
processor. Do this. You will see, <p>

-----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----
 Version: 2.3 <p>

Lines of random looking text characters here.
 -----END PGP MESSAGE----- <p>

This text (lines included) can be sent by e-mail to anyone on any computer
running PGP. But since it is encrypted with your public key, let's pretend
a friend made it and sent it to you. Toss the original. In PGP, do
'Open/decrypt', and choose the .asc file. Enter your pass phrase so PGP can
use your secret key. A text file, the decrypted message, will appear. [The
System 7 Control Panel "defaultappliction" by L. D'Oliveiro will allow a
double-click to open text files to the word processor of your choice (ftp
to ftp.luth.se in /pub/mac/system/controlpanels)]. When you receive a PGP
message, it will have e-mail headers, but PGP will ignore (and edit out!)
anything outside the PGP header and footers. <p>

Shortcut: write text in a word processor, copy it to the clipboard and have
PGP encrypt it THERE ('Clipboard' button in 'Encrypt/sign' dialog box),
then paste it into e-mail. This also works for decryption, allowing you to
paste the decrypted text anywhere. The finder also has 'Show Clipboard', or
you can check 'Decrypt to screen only' but I do NOT recommend this feature
(fails if lines &gt;80 characters, and crashes during saves). There is a nasty
bug in MacPGP2.3 which causes a crash if you use the Clipboard to check a
signed message and you don't have the public key to check it with. If you
get mail from someone who's key you don't have, don't use the Clipboard
feature! <p>

[You can just paste small text blocks into e-mail. Your software should
also have a "send" feature to autotype LARGE text files to the screen. This
is what I use, but it can be tricky AND there may be no error control
(characters may get lost, ruining the message). If lines get cut wrong,
turn off word-wrapping in your account or software. More reliable is to
upload a file ('rz'; or 'kermit', 'set file type text', 'receive') and
include it in e-mail (in Unix 'mail', '~r filename' as a line in e-mail, or
use 'mail -s "Hi there!" name@site &lt; filename'). You can view text files
with 'more filename', 'q' to stop. Flow control should be 'hardware' (in
software or modem setup string). If you RECEIVE long e-mail, use the
"capture" feature of your software when you view it, OR save it to a file
and download it. Making windows tiny lets text scroll faster. Ask questions
on comp.dcom.modems.] <p>

Checking 'Encrypt and sign' also SIGNS a message you are encrypting.
Signatures are a trick, in that they are ENCRYPTED with your secret key,
meaning a message must be from you (unaltered) since only your public key
can decode them. If you want to SIGN NON-encrypted text, use the menu item
'Sign Only' and check 'Append clear signature'. A text file will appear
containing your readable e-mail between the header and footers of the
signature. Anyone can check that this message is from you and is unaltered
(copy to Clipboard, then 'Open/Decrypt'), if they have your public key. <p>

[Problem with signing NON-encrypted messages: If you don't cut lines to
about 75 characters BEFORE signing, the carriage returns added on uploading
(by Unix or your software) will spoil the signature! For this I use
Drop*TextBreak by Robert Gibson (ftp to sumex-aim.stanford.edu in /info-
mac/text as drop-text-break.hqx). Another problem: certain characters may
be altered upon uploading text. Don't use smart quotes (curly symbols for '
and ") or control characters. E-mailing a message to yourself will reveal
problems (use a text comparison utility). This ONLY concerns "clearsigning"
of NON-encrypted messages.] <p>

To send your public key to a friend do 'Extract key' with 'aciify' checked,
and name it "My public key". A text file of your public key will appear: <p>

-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
 Version: 2.3 <p>

About 8 lines of random looking characters here.
 -----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK----- <p>

When you get a friend's public key, get it to your desktop (paste into
blank document and save as TEXT ONLY). Do 'Add keys', select the file, and
select pubring.pgp to add it to your public key ring. Try this with my key.
('Fingerprint key' will give you a short string of characters unique to
that key, for verbal confirmation of key origins.) There is also a finger
server for public keys. Do 'finger keyword@wasabi.io.com' to fetch
someone's public key, where "keyword" is part of his name or e-mail
address. <p>

Now you can encrypt text files with their public key to send to them. You
can also send non-text files (ANY Mac file) by using 'Treat source as a Mac
file' and 'Produce output in ASCII format'. You will again get PGP text
block to send. To decrypt this, it is the same as before. Presently MacPGP
wont let you select a Macintosh folder full of stuff, so use a compression
program (Stuffit Lite or Compact Pro, shareware) to put items into one
archive file (PGP itself compresses files so make NON-compressed
archives). <p>

[To encrypt a file on your hard disk only, you can use the menu item
'Conventional Encryption' (and even create "self-decrypting" Mac files)
with 'Treat source as Mac file' checked. However the pass phrase in this
case is ITSELF the key used to encrypt the file, so you must be VERY
careful in typing it and remembering it (and why not use the drag-and-drop
utility Curve Encrypt by Will Kinney instead, even though it doesn't
compress files like PGP does, it can do multiple files at once; from
ripem.msu.edu in pub/crypt/other/curve-encrypt-idea-for-mac as
curve_encrypt.sea.hqx). I prefer to just encrypt such files with my public
key, again checking only 'Treat source as Mac file". The result of these is
not a text file!] <p>

When you have PGP up and running, with a few signatures on your key, send
your public key to a keyserver. You can find most anyone's key on these
servers. See the "PGP FAQ" and the blurb in the PGP documentation for
details. (There are people who will plop your public key onto the
keyservers, even if you send it in e-mail and especially if posted to
Usenet. Be happy with your key first. You can still add new signatures to
your key on the servers by adding your the signed key to any server.) <p>

[Bug: if you are sent a PGP message by e-mail (ascii text-format), and you
don't end the name of this text file on your Mac with .asc, PGP will ask
you if you want to replace it. If you say yes and give it another name, it
may fail to immediately update the finder views. You wont be able to see
the output file (ignore the temporary files ending in .$01 and such), but
you CAN see it in the 'Open' dialog of a word processor. Three solutions:
add .asc (or just a period!), enter a new name while you are STILL in the
decryption options dialog box (not possible if you use the drag-and-drop
feature of System 7), or LET IT OVERWRITE THE ORIGINAL TEXT FILE (you loose
any text outside the PGP message). This is not a problem with binary PGP
messages, which normally end in .pgp but don't have to.] <p>

Realize that a PGP message contains readily recovered information about
which public key encrypted it and which private key signed it. On creating
a new key pair with an anonymous nickname and using an anonymous remailer
(send blank mail to help@anon.penet.fi or read about remailers in the PGP
FAQ), this information is removed. A commercial Unix account is good too,
as e-mail errors wont route to your LOCAL system administrators. Netcom
(408-554-UNIX) even lets you keep your real name private (but call by phone
or the sites you have telnetted in from are told). A different trick is to
clearsign your message, then encrypt the signed message with the person's
public key. Now who signed it isn't told to anyone except that person. Note
also that sending a floppy with no return address is much more secure than
using anonymous remailers on the Word Wide Wiretap, er... internet. <p>

Another trick is to HIDE your use of encryption. Stego by Romana Machado
(ftp to sumex-aim.stanford.edu in /info-mac/cmp) will hide text as the
least significant bit in a Mac PICT file, but this increases the size of a
message by 8-24 times. I prefer to type a message in a word processor, cut
it out, encrypt it within the Clipboard, paste it back, save it as a real
word processor file, then BinHex that (using the Drag and Drop utility
hqxer1.1 by John Stiles: ftp to sumex-aim.stanford.edu in /info-mac/cmp),
and finally have my software autotype the file into e-mail. This is fast,
and it's business as usual sending BinHex encoded Mac files. This way PGP
is simply a Clipboard utility that adds encryption to a word processor. On
receiving such a file, download it, drag it onto Stuffit Expander, and
again use PGP as a Clipboard utility to decrypt it. [You may need to put
'set escape=~' into a file called .mailrc, if your Unix system doesn't use
the normal tilde (~) escape character for e-mail, to avoid stripping any
lines out of BinHex files!] <p>

You can set many defaults by editing the text file config.txt. 'TextMode =
on' checks 'Treat source as text'. 'Recycle_Passwords = on' means you only
have to type a pass phrase once per PGP session (but get it right the first
time!). 'Armor = on' checks 'Produce output in ascii format'. 'ClearSig =
on' checks 'append clear signature'. 'Verbose = 0' sets Quiet Mode, which I
prefer. You can always uncheck them; they are only defaults. I do NOT
recommend setting 'showpass = on' which checks 'show pass phrase', since it
leaves it on the screen! Just check 'Show pass phrase' manually to avoid
this. <p>

Read the manual and the Usenet groups alt.security.pgp, alt.privacy and
talk.politics.crypto. If MacPGP ever freezes hold down the option, command,
and escape keys to force it to quit. Get a program to erase data from your
hard disk after you "empty" the Trash and a replacement for the Trash
itself (FlameFile by Josh Goldfoot does both; ftp to mac.archive.umich.edu
in /mac/util/security as flamefile1.38.cpt.hqx). Get "The Big Dummy's Guide
to the Internet" by Adam Gaffin and Joerg Heitkoetter (ftp to ftp.eff.org
in /pub/Net_info/Big_Dummy, as the text file bigdummy.txt). Get "Anonymity
FAQ" (ftp to rtfm.mit.edu, in /pub/usenet/news.answers/net-anonymity, in
four parts) and "Privacy and Anonymity FAQ" (in
/pub/usenet/news.answers/net-privacy, in three parts) by L. Detweiler. If
you find PGP hard to use, live with it; new versions will arrive. I know
nothing about non-Mac PGP. Go figure; don't ask me. I don't care about you.
I just want more people to use PGP so I can hide my wonderfully important
messages in the noise of your boring ones ;-). <p>

[If you get tired of the tiny scrollable list of keys when you select a
public key for encryption, open a COPY of MacPGP2.3 with ResEdit (ftp to
ftp.apple.com in /dts/mac/tools/resedit as resedit-2-1-1.hqx) and open
DLOG, #129, set 'MiniScreen' in the menu bar to the size of your screen,
and resize the little window to make it taller. Double click on it, then
move the buttons to the bottom, after dragging a rectangle around them to
select them. Make the selection box taller now too. Quit. Now you will get
a full-sized scrollable box which shows many more keys at once. Do NOT
distribute this modified form of MacPGP.] <p>

Note that PGP is very controversial, both legally (patent rights and export
laws) and politically (as a tool it empowers individuals to ensure their
own right to privacy). Despite this it is becoming the standard encryptor.
It may change the world. <p>

Comments on when and where I should post this and suggestions as to content
are invited. I see too many "How do I get PGP?" inquiries needing real
answers, and too many copies of PGP added to unused novelty collections.
POST THIS EVERYWHERE. Please do not alter it. (Copyright Xenon, 1994). <p>

Ron Rivest's response to Dorothy Denning Newsday editorial <p>

Please note I have no easy way to authenticate the validity of this note
since it is not crypto signed. Also please note I am happy to give both
sides (and there may be more than just two) of this discussion. But also
please don't yell at me if you don't like what you read. Yell at the sender
(cc or bcc me) and/or send me a rebuttal. I will attempt to not forward
things I consider liabilious, in bad taste or just grossly in-accurate AND
OBVIOUSLY things sent to me  that are not of interest to IP.  Dave <p>

Date: Fri, 25 Feb 94 16:24:20 EST
From: rivest@theory.lcs.mit.edu (Ron Rivest)
To: denning@cs.cosc.georgetown.edu
Subject: Newsday Editorial <p>

Hi Dorothy -- <p>

Thanks for sending me a copy of your editorial.  But I find the
reasoning you present misleading and unpersuasive. <p>

First, you argue that the clipper chip will be a useful law
enforcement tool.  Given the small number of currently authorized
wiretaps per year (under 1000) and the ease of using alternative
encryption technology or superencryption, it seems plausible to me
that law enforcement could expect at most ten "successful" clipper
wiretaps per year.  This is a pretty marginal basis for claiming that
clipper will "block crime". <p>

Second, you seem to believe that anything that will "block crime" must
therefore be a "good thing" and should therefore be adopted.  This is
not true, even if it is not subject to government abuse.  For example,
a system that could turn any telephone (even when on-hook) into an
authorized listening microphone might help law enforcement, but would
be unacceptable to almost all Americans.  As another example, tatooing
a person's social security number on his or her buttocks might help
law enforcement, but would also be objectionable.  Or, you could
require all citizens to wear a bracelet that could be remotely queried
(electronically, and only when authorized) to return the location of
that citizen.  There are all kinds of wonderfully stupid things one
could do with modern technology that could "help" law enforcement.
But merely being of assistance to law enforcement doesn't make a
proposal a good thing; many such ideas are objectionable and
unacceptable because of the unreasonably large cost/benefit ratio
(real or psychological cost). The clipper proposal, in
my opinion, is of exactly this nature. <p>

Third, you seem unnecessarily polly-annish about our government and the
potential for abuse.  The clipper proposal places all trust for its
management within the executive branch; a corrupt president could
direct that it be used for inappropriate purposes.  The unspecified
nature of many of the associated procedures leaves much room to
speculate that there are "holes" that could be exploited by government
officials to abuse the rights of American citizens.  Even if the
proposal were modified to split the trust among the various branches
of government, one might still reasonably worry about possible abuse.
Merely because you've met the current set of representatives of
various agencies, and feel you can trust them, doesn't mean that such
trust can be warranted in their successors.  One should build in
institutional checks and balances that overcome occasional moral
lapses in one or more office holders. <p>

Fourth, your discussion of "searching your home and seizing your
papers" is misleading.  You seem to imply that because law enforcement
can be issued a warrant to search your home, that we should adopt
clipper.  Yet this analogy only makes sense if individuals were
required to deposit copies of their front door keys with the
government.  I can build any kind of house I wish (out of steel, for
example), and put any kind of locks on it, and wire up any kind of
intrusion detectors on it, etc.  The government, armed with a search
warrant, is not guaranteed an "easy entry" into my home at all.  The
appropriate analogical conclusion is that individuals should be able
to use any kind of encryption they want, and the government should be
allowed (when authorized, of course) to try and break their
encryption. <p>

Finally, you argue (elsewhere, not in this editorial) that the decision
rests in part on "classified" information.  Such an argument only makes
sense if there is a specific law-enforcement situation that makes such
classified information timely and relevant.  (E.g., if there was a
current investigation as to whether the Department of the Treasury had
been infiltrated by organized crime.)  The use of "classified information"
is otherwise generally inappropriate in discussing communications policy
that will last over decades. <p>

This hardly covers all of the relevant issues, but it covers the
points that came immediately to mind in reading your editorial... <p>

Cheers,
        Ron <p>

P.S. Feel free to pass along, quote, or otherwise re-distribute this... <p>

PGP-voice, hmm where is the Clipper chip? <p>

From: grady@netcom.com (Grady Ward) <p>

It looks like PGP-voice is going to happen sooner than later. <p>

Posted on sumex-aim.stanford.edu is a demo version of 2Way Talker
a utility that permits full-duplex conversations with any other
Macintosh on an AppleTalk network.  This includes WANS connected
with modems and Apple Remote Access. <p>

And it works without requiring *any* additional hardware since Macs
nowadays have microphones as well as speakers built in. <p>

Implementing full public key controlled conversations is now just a
matter of exchanging RSA keys and doing IDEA on the AppleTalk packets
on the fly.  Technically trivial. <p>

It's almost here, folks. <p>

A Push for Surveillance Software (fwd) <p>

From: mikemck@mrc.com <p>

Here are some choice excerpts from the headline
article of the NY Times Business section, 2/28. <p>

A Push for Surveillance Software <p>

by John Markoff <p>

In the age of computer communications and digital telephone
calls, the American people must be willing to give up a degree of
personal privacy in exchange for safety and security, the head of
the Federal Bureau of Investigation said. <p>

In an interview on Friday, Louis J. Freeh (note: is it really
pronounced Free?), the FBI director, defended proposed legislation
that critics say would turn the nation's telephone network into
a vast surveillance system. He said taxpayers would be asked to
pay up to half a billion dollars to develop and deploy the
necessary network software. <p>

The administration wants to impose new technology that
would enable law-enforcement agents to gather a wealth of personal
information by monitoring citizens' calling patterns and credit
card transactions over the telephone network - and over the
two-way cable television networks being planned by cable and
phone companies. The system would go well beyond current wire-
tapping technology, because much of the information could be
gleaned without the police or FBI actually having to eavesdrop
on specific voice or electronic-mail conversations. <p>

"The costs are high, but you have to do a cost-benefit
analysis," said Mr. Freeh, who insisted that fighting terrorists
and criminals was the governments intention - not playing
Big Brother to the citizenry. <p>

... <p>

The administration is trying to line up congressional
support for the legislation, called Digital Telephony and
Communications Privacy Improvement Act of 1994, before having it
formally introduced. <p>

... <p>

____________________________________________________________ <p>

There's much more but I don't have a scanner handy. I
can't believe how quickly this appalling threat has developed.
The government always veils its expansion of powers as a need
for increased security: the War on Drugs, criminals, terrorists.
What I'm really surprised by is that they foresee the endpoint
of freely available information technology, a diminishing need
for centralized government. <p>

If the net contributes to the end of centralized control,
it's easy to extrapolate who the target terrorists are going
to be. <p>

CLIPPER NEWS --- A brief note on the fact that Senator Leahy has decided to hold hearings on Clipper Chip! <p>

From: jberman@eff.org Jerry Berman
Date: Mon, 7 Mar 1994 19:09:22 -0500
Subject: Leahy to hold hearings on Clipper Chip! <p>

Dear Friends on the Electronic Frontier: <p>

I have some good news to share with you.  Senator Leahy just sent me a
letter indicating that he *will* be scheduling hearings on the
Administration's Clipper Chip proposal.  I would like to thank all of you
who sent us messages to forward to him urging hearings.  I'm sure that
stack of messages we printed out made a significant impact on the Senator
-- the stack was over seven inches tall!  (We look forward to the day when

Dear Jerry, <p>

Thank you for forwarding to me the many thoughtful and informative messages
you received over the Internet regarding the Administration's recent
approval of an escrowed encryption standard, known as the Clipper Chip. <p>

Many of the messages urge Congress to hold hearings to review the
Administration's Clipper Chip standard.  In fact, I intend to hold a
hearing before the Judiciary Subcommittee on Technology and the Law, which
I chair, to consider the important issues raised by the Clipper Chip.  I
will let you know when a date for the hearing is scheduled. <p>

Thank you again. <p>

Bralow/Denning debate on AOL <p>

3/10/94 8:49:41 PM Opening "Chat Log 3/10/94 CLIPPER" for recording. <p>

OnlineHost  : Good evening and welcome to the Time Online Odeon! Tonight we
look from both sides at the Clipper Chip, a semiconductor device that the
National Security Agency developed and wants installed in every telephone,
computer modem and fax machine. <p>

OnlineHost  : In his article in the current issue of TIME, Philip
Elmer-DeWitt writes: "The chip combines a powerful encryption algorithm
with a ''back door'' -- the cryptographic equivalent of the master key that
opens schoolchildren's padlocks when they forget their combinations. A
''secure'' phone equipped with the chip could, with proper authorization,
be cracked by the government. <p>

OnlineHost: "Law-enforcement agencies say they need this capability to keep
tabs on drug runners, terrorists and spies. Critics denounce the Clipper --
and a bill before Congress that would require phone companies to make it
easy to tap the new digital phones -- as Big Brotherly tools that will
strip citizens of whatever privacy they still have in the computer age. <p>

OnlineHost: "Lined up on one side are the three-letter cloak-and-dagger
agencies -- the NSA, the CIA and the FBI -- and key policymakers in the
Clinton Administration (who are taking a surprisingly hard line on the
encryption issue). Opposing them is an equally unlikely coalition of
computer firms, civil libertarians, conservative columnists and a strange
breed of cryptoanarchists who call themselves the cypherpunks." <p>

RPTime: Lined up on our stage tonight are John Perry Barlow, Dr. Dorothy
Denning and Philip Elmer-DeWitt. Barlow is co-founder of the Electronic
Frontier Foundation, which promotes freedom in digital media. A recognized
commentator on computer security, he is arguing against the Clipper Chip
Dr. Denning is the chairperson of the Computer Science Department at
Georgetown University. A leading expert on cryptography and data security,
she favors the adoption of the Clipper Chip. Philip Elmer-DeWitt, TIME's
technology editor will lead the questioning of our guests. Audience
questions may be sent up using the Interact with Host function....Phil? <p>

PhilipED: Dr. Denning, could you *briefly* make the case for why we need
the key escrow encryption system. <p>

DDenning: The government needs a new encryption standard to replace DES.
They came up with a very strong algorithm called SKIPJACK. In making that
available, they didn't want to do it in a way that could ultimately prove
harmful to society. So they came up with the idea of key escrow so that if
SKIPJACK were used to conceal criminal activity, they would be able to get
access to the communications. <p>

PhilipED: THanks. Mr. Barlow, could you briefly make the case *against*
Clipper. We'll see if I can be brief. We oppose Clipper in large part
because of the traffic analysis which it makes possible. We believe that it
is in the functional nature of the chip as designed to greatly enhance the
ability of government to observe who we are calling, when, and from where,
all fairly automatically and centrally. We also oppose Clipper because of
the many way in which we believe the escrow system could be compromised, by
people and institutions both inside and outside of government. <p>

PhilipED: Dr. Denning, what about John's contention that Clipper makes it
easier to detect calling patterns. <p>

DDenning: I don't buy this. First off, for law enforcement to access any
communications, they need a court order. Even if the communications are
encrypted. Second, with a court order, they can get access to call setup
information and find out what other lines the subject of the investigation
is talking to. This is of much more use than anything in the encrypted
stream. <p>

PhilipED: John, is Dorothy right that you need a court order for call set
up info? <p>

Barlow1: Dorothy, the government asked for and received over 100,000
calling records last year without a court order. I see nothing in the
Clipper documents which indicates that they would require a court order to
get this kind of information, which each chip would make readily available
to the entire network. <p>

DDenning: You need a court order to do implement pen registers and dialed
number recorders in order to find out who is talking to whom. <p>

Barlow1: Furthermore, my faith in court orders has been eroded by 30 years
of government wiretap abuse. <p>

PhilipED: Aren't we talking about three different hurdles here, one for a
wiretap... <p>

Barlow1: But that's only with the present system where putting a pen
register on a line requires physical entrance to a phone company site. <p>

PhilipED: One for a pen register (to track calling patterns in real time)
and one for phone records. <p>

RPTime: Let's take a question from the audience... How would you guarantee
that this facility will never be misused? If you can't make that guarantee,
why should a democratic society, with a prohibition against prior
restraint, consent to this? John Barlow? <p>

Barlow1: There are three different sources of information, as you say. But
there are not three "hurdles." That sounds like a question for Dorothy. I
don't think we should, obviously. <p>

RPTime: Dr. Denning? <p>

DDenning: First of all, there has been no evidence of widespread abuse of
wiretaps since passage of the 1968 and 1978 wiretap statutes. Second, there
are a lot of security mechanisms going into it to protect against abuse.
Third, it will provide much greater protection against illegal wiretaps
than we have now, since almost all phone conversations are in the clear. It
will make virtually all illegal wiretaps impossible. Fourth, if for some
reason it doesn't provide adequate protection, we can destroy the key
databases and everyone will have absolute privacy against government
wiretaps. I don't think our society will tolerate that kind of abuse. <p>

PhilipED: John, isn't Dorothy right that you're better off with compromised
encryption than none? <p>

Barlow1: Gee, where to begin... First of all, there was plenty of abuse
after 1968. Remember Watergate, Dorothy? Second, I believe that Clipper in
the Net will dramatically *enhance* certain powers of... <p>

DDenning: I was talking specifically about wiretap abuses. And there hasn't
been any evidence since the 1978 law. <p>

Barlow1: surveillance over current technical abilities. One of the reasons
that wiretap hasn't been more abused is the bureaucratic overhead of
current practices. Make it so that it doesn't require 50 agents to conduct
a wire tap and you'll see a lot more of it. And Watergate included quite a
number of wiretap violations. Indeed, the burglers were caught trying to
install one. As to the assertion that we can always back up and destroy the
databases if we don't like it, I can't imagine that someone as bright as
yourself would believe that this is possible. Technology and power ratchet
into positions which almost never retract without a complete change in the
system of authority <p>

RPTime: Care to respond Dr. Denning? <p>

DDenning: Clipper would prevent the watergate burglars from getting
anywhere since they wouldn't have a court order. Clipper will not make
wiretaps cheaper or easier. Wiretaps are becoming more diffiults. And there
will always be more agents involved becasue they have to follow exacting
procedures, including minimization (throw out all conversations that are
not specific to the crime at hand). <p>

Barlow1: Dorothy, they were from the *Government* remember? I can't imagine
that Nixon wouldn't have been able to find a sympathetic ear from somebody
at NIST and somebody else at Treasury. Further, you're not talking about
the truly insidious element of this, which is dramatically improved traffic
analysis. Content is less important than context, and most agents will
support this. <p>

RPTime: Another question from the audience. JCMaille asks... Does the
government have a constitutional right of access to my personal
communications? Dr. Denning, why don't you go first? <p>

DDenning: The Supreme Court ruled that wiretaps with a court order are
Constitutional. At one time, communications were not even protected under
the 4th Amendment. The government could wiretap without a court order! Now
a court order is required. <p>

PhilipED: To put the question another way, do citizens have a right to use
powerful encryption? <p>

DDenning: Right now there are no laws preventing the use of any encryption.
Clipper is voluntary. You can still use something else. <p>

RPTime: We have to apologize. John Barlow has temporarily lost his connection... <p>

PhilipED: Dr. Denning, in your opinion... would a law outlawing powerful
encryption be unconstitutional? <p>

DDenning: I don't think so. But that doesn't mean it will happen. <p>

RPTime: John Barlow is back with us. Sorry for the interruption! Barlow,
Denning just said she didn't think a law banning powerful encryption would
be unconstitutional What do you say? Hi folks. Don't know what happened.
Gald to be back Gald indeed! <p>

Barlow1: Actually, I believe that our current export embargoes are a
violation of the 1st Amendment which specify speech without regard to the
manner of speech. If we could restrict manner of speech, it would be
constitutional to require that everyone speak English. Which of course it
isn't <p>

PhilipED: John, can you make the case why ordinary law-abiding citizens
need powerful encryption? <p>

Barlow1: Because it is in the nature of digitally networked communications
to be quite visible. Everytime we make any sort of transaction in a digital
environment, we smear our fingerprints all over Cyberspace. If we are to
have any privacy in the future, we will need virtual "walls" made of
cryptography. <p>

RPTime: Another audience question... Isn't this like the gun argument? If
guns are outlawed only criminals will have guns? Well, if clipper is
standardized, won't criminals be the ones NOT using it? <p>

RPTime: Dr. Denning? If Clipper becomes the de facto standard, then it will
be the chief method of encryption. That would be what you'd get at Radio
Shack. What criminals use will depend on what is readily available and what
their cohorts are using. Both parties of a conversation have to use the
same thing. Criminals also talk to a lot of people outside their immediate
circle - e.g., to buy goods and services. Also, they can be quite stupid at
times. But the main thing is that criminals will not be able to take
advantage of the SKIPJACK algorithm as a way of concealing their
conversations. This is the whole point. It is not to catch criminals. It is
to allow people access to a really high quality algorithm in a way that
someone cannot use it to conceal criminal activity. <p>

Barlow1: The gun analogy is excellent up to a point. I can't for the life
of me imagine why we would think that even a stupid criminal would use
Clipper if something else were available. And when I talk to people in the
administration their big hobgoblin is the "nuclear-armed" terrorist. Any
fanatic smart enough to assemble and detonate a nuclear device is going to
be smart enough to download PGP from a bulletin board somewhere. Also, I'd
like to point out that the gun analogy doesn't go the whole distance.
Crypto is by its nature a purely *defensive* technology. You can't shoot
people with it. <p>

PhilipED: Speaking of PGP, Dr. Denning, is that encryption system secure,
in your opinion? <p>

DDenning: I don't know of anyone who's been able to break the IDEA
algorithm that it uses. <p>

RPTime: Back to the audience for a question from Steve HW.. This is for Dr.
Denning. What is the evidence of harm if the Clipper proposal is not
adopted? <p>

DDenning: The harm would be to the government. They would not be able to
use it and would have to resort to something less secure. Also, Clipper is
part of a larger project to make hardware available for encryption and
digital signatures. This will be used, for example, in the Defense Message
System. The goverment needs a new standard. I personally believe that
making really powerful encryption like SKIPJACK available without key
escrow could be harmful to society. Wiretaps have been essential for
preventing and solving many serious crimes and terrorist activities. <p>

Barlow1: Why on earth would the government have to use something else if
they failed to get the rest of rest of us to buy into this folly? Hey, they
are already using SKIPJACK. It's a government algorithm and has been in use
for a... <p>

DDenning: CPSR and others are asking the government to drop Clipper. <p>

Barlow1: long time. There are plenty other algorithms which we can use
which are truly protected... unless of course, this is only the first step
in a process which will outlaw other forms of crypto. And I believe that it
must be. Makes absolutely no sense otherwise. EFF is not asking the
Government to drop Clipper, though we would vastly prefer they did. We're
merely asking that no steps be taken to require it either by law or
practice...as, for example, would be the case if you had to use a Clipper
chip to file your tax return. <p>

PhilipED: Dr. Denning, do you think this is the "first step in a process to
outlaw crypto"? <p>

DDenning: No I do not. The government has not been using SKIPJACK to my
knowledge. The Clipper initiative represents the first time that the
government has put one of their really good algorithms out there in the
unclassified arena. They are trying to do this in a way that won't backfire
against the public. Other NSA developed algorithms are not available for
purchase by the public. <p>

Barlow1: I appreciate their willingness to make some of that crypto
research available to a public which has paid so much for it, but I'm
afraid that I would never trust an algorithm which was given to me by any
government. And I certainly don't trust a classified algorithm like
Skipjack, even without a back door which everyone can see. I think I'll
stick to systems which have been properly vetted to be clear of such
compromises, like RSA. I hope others will do likewise and that RSA will
become the standard which Clipper shouldn't be. <p>

RPTime: Time for one more question from our audience... To John Barlow.
Isn't society becoming increasingly vulnerable to concerted
criminal/terrorist disruption, requiring *stronger* law enforcement tools? <p>

Barlow1: Gee. I don't know. It's a scary world. However, I'm willing to
take my chances with the few terrorists and drug lords there are out there
rather than trusting government with the kind of almost unlimited
surveillance power which Clipper and Digital Telephony would give them.
It's a touch choice. But when you look at the evil perpetrated by
government over this century in the name of stopping crime, it far exceeds
that done by other organized criminals. <p>

RPTime: Dr. Denning, hasn't remote listening technology enhanced police
abilities to eavesdrop to the point... where the loss of a few wire taps
won't mean much? <p>

DDenning: No. They need to get the cooperation of the service providers to
implement a wiretap. The loss of some wiretaps could be costly indeed. As
an example, wiretaps were used to help solve a case that involved plans by
a Chicago gang from shooting down a commercial airliner. There have been 2
cases where they helped save the lives of kids who were going to be
kidnaped for the making of a snuff murder film. They helped solve a case
where a man's house was going to be bombed. I could go on. If we take
John's arguments about law enforcement to their logical conclusion, we'd
just get rid of law enforcement. I think it's better to have it. The people
in law enforcement hate it as much as the rest of us when some member of
the community does something wrong. And they correct it, design new
procedures and laws where necessary, and go on. <p>

Barlow1: Oh, please. I'm not proposing eliminating police. I'm opposing
giving them unlimited powers. Also,these are the same cases cited over and
over by everyone from you to Judge Freeh. Surely, we aren't going to
fundamentally change the balance of power in this country because of these
two (undocumented, to my knowledge) stories. <p>

DDenning: Clipper is not going to change the balance of power. It does not
give law enforcement any additional authority to do wiretaps. <p>

Barlow1: Well, this is where we basically disagree, Dorothy. If we could
continue the same level of LE capacity we presently have, I'd have no
objection. But I believe, for reasons I'm not sure we have the bandwidth to
discuss here, that we are talking about dramatically enhancing their
abilities. For one thing, we would greatly reduce the bureaucratic overhead
involved in wiretap, which is what keeps it under 900 cases nationwide at
the present. <p>

RPTime: And that will have to be the last word on the matter for tonight... <p>

DDenning: The overhead of a wiretap is more likely to increase, not decrease. <p>

PhilipED: Not quite! Maybe not! ;-) <p>

RPTime: THAT will be the final word! <p>

Barlow1: Well, let's get together and talk, Dorothy. <p>

RPTime: TIME thanks Dr. Dorothy Denning and John Perry Barlow for being
with us tonight... along with Philip Elmer-DeWitt. Thank you all, and
goodnight! Thank you both. This was very interesting. <p>

DDenning: Thank you for the opportunity to be here! <p>

A Publication of the Electronic Frontier Foundation        ISSN 1062-9424 <p>

Subject: DPSWG Coalition's Digital Telephony Letter to White House
<hr> <p>

On March 9, the Digital Privacy and Security Working Group sent the following
letter to the Administration calling into question the procedures by which
the FBI's Digital Telephony "Wiretap Bill" draft is being examined, and
expressing harsh criticism of the would-be legislation.  The DPSWG is a
coalition of privacy and civil liberties organizations, trade
associations, and industry leaders, coordinated by the Electronic Frontier
Foundation. <p>

March 9, 1994 <p>

The President William J. Clinton
The White House
Washington, D.C.  20500 <p>

The Vice President of the United States
United States Senate
Washington, D.C.  20510 <p>

Dear Mr. President and Mr. Vice President: <p>

Telecommunications carriers and other members of the Digital Privacy and
Security Working Group are keenly aware of the concerns raised by the
Administration regarding the ability to intercept communications
transmitted over advanced commu nications networks. <p>

We are concerned, however, about the nature of the process upon which the
Administration has embarked to address these issues.  Seeking immediate
industry reaction to the FBI's draft legislation and congressional passage
of such legislation shortly thereafter is troubling.  It suggests
curtailment of public debate and of congressional deliberation.  Given the
interest of the public in these matters and their complexity, it is
essential that there be a full public debate on these issues. <p>

Industry is currently cooperating with appropriate authorities to avoid
future problems and to expand existing capacities.  This is not to say that
there have not been some transitional concerns particularly upon the
introduction of new technologies that have grown greatly in popularity.  But,
whenever transitional problems have arisen, industry representatives have
worked with law enforcement officials to resolve them. <p>

The FBI's actions are especially troubling in light of our view that
legislation is not needed to accomplish the agency's goals.  We still see
no evidence that current law enforcement efforts are being jeopardized by
new technologies.  Nor are we convinced that future law enforcement
activities will be jeopardized given industry cooperation. <p>

We still believe that continued cooperation by government and industry
within the working relationship that has emerged from the 1992 Quantico
Joint Government Industry Group will resolve "the digital telephony
problem" and preserve the government's current authorities.  The
discussions have succeeded in identifying specific problems and have begun
the process of generating concrete, cost-effective solutions.  This process
has facilitated a more robust exchange of technical information and
an identification of possible new equipment and police tactics needed to
achieve law enforcement goals.  Nevertheless, we are prepared to work with
the Congress and the Administration to attempt to resolve the legitimate
concerns of law enforcement. <p>

The signatories to this letter cannot overemphasize how critical it is that
any new initiatives in this area preserve the public's confidence in the
privacy of information carried over the public switched network.  Less than
a decade after enactment of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of
1986, the nation can ill afford to undercut customer privacy expectations.
Indeed, on the eve of the National Information Infrastructure's deployment,
preserving customer confidence is all the more important.  Privacy
protection is not a secondary interest here. <p>

Survey after survey performed by Professor Alan Westin and others have
demonstrated the public's concern with privacy and the security of their
communications.  We all must seek to maximize those interests and assure
the public that their communications are protected. <p>

Subject: Letter of DPSWG to FBI Dir. Freeh on Wiretap Bill's Privacy Threat
<hr> <p>

On March 11, the Digital Privacy and Security Working Group sent the
letter below to FBI Dir. Louis Freeh as a followup to the March 9 letter to
the Administration, detailing the DPSWG's criticisms of the FBI's proposed
Digital Telephony bill, and raising serious privacy questions.  EFF and
the DPSWG feel that the Digital Telephony scheme, coupled with the
Administration's Clipper Chip plan, could turn the future National
Inforamation Infrastructure into a nationwide surveillance network.
It is clear that law enforcement needs and wants do not require
such overly-broad legislative action, and the possible gain to law
enforcement is vastly outweighed by the massive threat to citizen privacy.
The DPSWG is a coalition of privacy and civil liberties organizations, trade
associations, and industry leaders, coordinated by the Electronic Frontier
Foundation. <p>

March 11, 1994 <p>

By Hand Delivery
Mr. Louis Freeh
Director
Federal Bureau of Investigation
Washington, D.C.
Dear Director Freeh: <p>

This letter is a follow-up to our letter of March 9, 1994 to President
Clinton and Vice President Gore (a copy is attached).  While we do not
believe that new legislation is needed to accomplish the FBI's goals, we
take this opportunity to more specifically raise some of the questions that
should be answered in pursuing any digital telephony legislation.  The
draft that the White House has given us for comment is overly broad, and
it is our hope that this letter will assist in narrowing the scope of any
legislation.
While we have additional, important questions and concerns, this letter
sets forth our primary concerns. <p>

(1) Should digital telephony legislation reach "call setup information"
    independently of a "Title III" search warrant? <p>

The New York Times of February 28, 1994 quotes you as stating, "My real
objective is to get access to the content of telephone calls."  The bill
should therefore be limited to content of communications and incidental
call setup or transactional data. <p>

Legislation should apply to "call setup information" only when that
information is incident to a warrant issued for wire, oral, or electronic
communications as set forth in 18 U.S.C. $ 2518.  Extending the legislation's
scope beyond the acquisition of content (pursuant to a warrant under
section 2518) to the independent acquisition of call setup information
raises many issues that require examination.  For example, currently the
legal standard for obtaining transactional data is a certification (via
subpoena or statement to a judge) that the sought-after data is relevant to
an ongoing criminal investigation.  In the era of personal communications
services ("PCS") and of the information highway, transactional data will
reveal far more about individuals than it has in the past.  In fact, in some
cases it may be equivalent to content information.  This transactional data
certainly could make it possible to build a detailed model of an individual's
behavior and movements.  The net result could be government dictating to
industry that it create a surveillance-based system that will allow federal,
state, and local government to use a service provider's electronic
communication facilities to conduct minute-by-minute surveillance of
individuals. <p>

As long as they have an IRS or other administrative subpoena or a law
enforcement agent willing to certify that the sought-after data is
relevant to an ongoing criminal investigation, law enforcement officials
could demand that they be notified at some remote location every time
certain individuals communicate by telephone, and their location at the
time, as well as every database they connect to and when they log on and
off.  In short, law enforcement officials could insist on instantaneously
knowing the existence of every single electronic communication (but not
its content). <p>

The enormous potential for abuse and threat to personal privacy suggests
that, if transactional data were to be covered by digital telephony
legislation, it should be incidental to a "Title III" wiretap warrant.  This
would not limit in any way law enforcement's access to trap and trace, pen
register, or call billing information under current law or practice.  This is
particularly true given that there has been no case made that
demonstrates any current or potential difficulty in getting this non-content
information under current practices.  The technology in fact has made
these type of services much easier for law enforcement to use and access.
Additional legislation is simply not necessary to obtain this data. <p>

(2) What is covered? <p>

The obligation to isolate the content of communications must be reasonably
related to the service provider's telecommunications services.  It would
be unreasonable for the FBI to demand any person involved with the
communication to furnish it with access to that communication.  For
example, most providers, including local telephone companies, usually
need to isolate communications for purposes of billing and maintenance.  It
is appropriate for the FBI to seek their assistance in intercepting
communications on their networks only when the requests are reasonably
related to the telecommunications services they provide. <p>

Therefore, the question is not necessarily who is covered, but what
telecommunications services are covered.  For example, the legislation
should reflect the fact that, in reselling services, even local telephone
companies sometimes are unable in those instances to furnish call setup
information regardless of whether it is incident to the acquisition of a
communication's content. <p>

(3) What will be the requirements placed upon service providers and what
    will be the standard of compliance that will be applied? <p>

Legislation should carefully define the obligations of service providers.
This is not the case with the FBI's current draft of proposed legislation.
These obligations are vague and subject to considerable interpretation.
Service providers and manufactures must have flexibility to adopt
procedures that reasonably comply with the specific functional performance
requirements of law enforcement. <p>

This is particularly true where, as here, compliance requires an
assessment of future needs and interoperability requirements.  There
is a  difference between compliance and a guarantee, and legislation must
reflect that difference.  Carriers should be required to provide reasonable
cooperation and that cooperation should be measured by a standard of
reasonable compliance. <p>

In installing new software or equipment under this statute, a service
provider must be able to reasonably assess future demands by law
enforcement.  Other industries subject to regulation at least know, for
example, the temperature at which they must maintain the specimens, the
emission standard they must satisfy, or the type of safety restraint
equipment they must install and the date by which they must have it
installed in vehicles.  Service providers cannot be held to an absolute
standard of compliance where they are using and delivering new
technologies to the public and the demands of law enforcement are not
clearly specified.  This applies to both capability and capacity.  Law
enforcement must be specific in its requirements for capacity and
capability from each service provider. <p>

(4) What is expected of commercial mobile service providers? <p>

It is not a foregone conclusion that mobility in a digitized
telecommunications environment will degrade or otherwise impede the
law enforcement community's ability to effectively execute court-
approved wiretap orders. <p>

Wireless carriers are committed to assisting law enforcement agencies to
successfully wiretap and intercept voice communications.  To accomplish
this goal, the wireless industry understands that available excess port
capacity is needed in all switches throughout the nation.  While it may be
reasonable for federal and state law enforcement agencies to acquire the
contents of wireless communications pursuant to "Title III"  warrants
through additional port capacity, it would be prohibitively expensive to
require that every one of the nation's switches be connected to the FBI to
enable it to acquire such information on a "real time" basis at remote
locations. <p>

Connecting every one of the nation's switches to the FBI, moreover,
would increase exponentially the risk of unauthorized access to wireless
communications.  Further, the proliferation of fraudulent use of wireless
telephones through such techniques as "cloning" and "tumbling" ESNs
(electronic serial numbers) poses additional questions with respect to
privacy and the ability of law enforcement to properly execute court-
approved wiretap orders. <p>

(5) What are the responsibilities of manufacturers and suppliers, if any? <p>

The FBI wishes manufacturers of telecommunications equipment and providers
of support services to fall within the scope of the legislation. But,
would service providers be held liable for software or hardware that
is not available from vendors?  Why?  How would the obligations be
enforced against foreign manufacturers?  What would be the liability of a
domestic carrier that relies upon foreign manufacturers?  What are the
trade implications of having domestic manufacturers export equipment
designed for governmental surveillance? <p>

(6) How, and during what period, are costs to be recovered to ensure that
    there is a direct relationship between the costs reasonably incurred
    by covered entities and the government's requirements? <p>

Government should pay for what it needs, which will help focus attention
upon the facilities that truly need upgrading.  If the government does not
pay for upgrades or facilities, then the service providers should not be
held responsible.  The FBI appears to have accepted the concept that
government should pay for the costs of compliance but has so far
underestimated these costs and proposed an arbitrary three-year limit on
cost reimbursement.  Government compensation should be ongoing with
industry's compliance. <p>

We trust you find our comments helpful.  We remain prepared to work with
you, Congress, and others to attempt to resolve the legitimate concerns of
law enforcement. <p>

Sincerely yours, <p>

 Panel discussion on cryptography policy -- Pugwash Panel <p>

Panel discussion on cryptography <p>

Dr. Peter Tygar <p>

Cryptography transforms plaintext into cyphertext --
  normal text into a format that is unreadable.  This is done
  through a key, the computer equivalent of a secret decoder ring.
  Cryptography is essential for military operations; crucial
  elements of the Allied victory in Europe and Japan were due to
  cryptographic breakthroughs against the German Enigma system and
  the Japanese Purple system, including winning the Battle of
  Midway.
        Truman formed the National Security Agency after WWII;
  for years it was said that that stood for "no such agency."
  Funded better than CIA, works to monitor international
  communications.
        NSA issued a call for public encryption standards, and
  IBM's Lucifer was adopted as the Data Encryption Standard in 1976
  for ten years; an extension was reluctantly approved for five
  years.  Encryption is still not widely available on the Internet,
  but it is slowly being deployed through data communications.
        DES is widely believed to be too insecure to use --
  hardware advances eventually outstrip the algorithm's security.
  The NSA developed a new system called Skipjack, details of which
  are kept secret by the NSA.  Skipjack uses a larger key and is
  theoretically more secure, but since the standards are not known
  it is impossible to verify.
        Skipjack is being made available through "black box"
  implementation -- a sealed hardware chip that makes it impossible
  to see the algorithm.  (Intel claims the ability to reverse
  engineer the chip.)  Skipjack can be broken through a key-escrow
  system, which stores keys for each chip in government
  repositories.  With the government key, the user key can be
  deciphered. Two agencies share the repositories, and both must
  give access before the key can be broken.
        Another form of cryptography is called public-key
  cryptography, which has two keys for cyphertext -- a public key
  which is used for encryption, and a private key that is used for
  decryption.  The RSA algorithm is an example of this.  The system
  is slower than single-key systems.
        Cryptographic algorithms are included on the
  not-for-export list, which precludes international trade in
  commercial encryption.  The government has been unwilling to
  relax this prohibition, but has indicated a willingness to allow
  export of Clipper.  It is unclear how well the international
  community would accept a cryptographic key that could be broken
  by the US government. <p>

Dr. Thomas Longstaff <p>

Longstaff is a member of the Computer Emergency Response
  Team, which focuses on security issues on the Internet.  As a
  DARPA-funded group, they can't take a position on Clipper, but
  since they concentrate on Internet they have been able to remain
  neutral.
        CERT was recently involved in an alert where user
  passwords were frequently stolen and used for break-ins.  Since
  there is no host-to-host encryption standard, passwords are sent
  around as cleartext across links that are easily monitored.  It
  is very difficult to put encryption on the Internet, since it
  surpasses national boundaries.  Most algorithms have found their
  way overseas, but strictly speaking an American cannot provide
  the system.
        Unless you deliberately encrypt a message, your e-mail is sent
  as cleartext.  Some standards to change that are underway, such as the
  government-funded Privacy Enhanced Mail.  Unfortunately, the tools are
  difficult to install and it has not been widely adopted.
        A grassroots effort called Pretty Good Privacy has been
  distributed since the author did not know about the export laws
  -- it's now been taken over by a group in Finland and can be
  found on many platforms.
        RSA holds a lock on all public-key uses, so it can't be
  used without a licensing fee -- all in all, it's hard to use any
  encryption on Internet.
        Cryptography is mostly used by college students, security
  professionals, and criminals.  International law enforcement
  agencies are struggling with criminals who have PCs that produce
  essentially unbreakable codes.  An unpublished study tracked
  crypto use, and found that all uses were by students and people
  using e-mail for unauthorized business use.
        Clipper algorithms may find their way onto the net. Older
  algorithms can still be of use, since the sheer volume of
  encrypted traffic if widely used would preclude cracking the
  entire stream to find the desired cleartext. <p>

David Sobel <p>

Clipper is the first battle over the design of the
  information infrastructure and the security safeguards it will
  include.  The underlying principle will lay the groundwork for
  the future information environment.
        Health care is an excellent example of the need for
  privacy, since any centralized system will have electronic
  transmission as a centerpiece of the plan.
        Fundamental questions of what sort of society do we want
  to have, and what values will guide the development of the
  National Information Infrastructure?  This is a political issue
  of surveillance and wiretapping; 80% of those polled are opposed
  to Clipper and the concept of the government having the absolute
  ability to conduct surveillance.  Within recent history the
  government has shown inability to responsibly conduct these
  investigations without abuse.  The NSA specifically was found to
  have conducted widescale illegal investigations of the
  communications of American citizens.
        Congress debated in 1987 who should take responsibility
  for civilian computer security; it was decided that the NSA, a
  secret organization, was inappropriate for this work.  NSA was
  given control of military tech, and National Institute for
  Standards and Technology given the civilian side.
        NIST proposed a digitial signature standard on 1991,
  which was later found to have been developed by NSA, despite
  deliberate firewall set up by Congress by Computer Security Act
  of 1987.  Again with the Clipper chip, the NSA has overstepped
  its bounds and is providing major thrust behind civilian security
  policy.
        NSA operates without the oversight of civilian agencies.
  Since the algorithm is classified, it can't be checked for
  strength -- worse still, there is major cause for concern in
  basing our communications infrastructure on classified
  technology.
        Clipper goes against the values of the First Amendment.
  There must be concern when the government attempts to regulate
  the means of our communication.  The Fourth Amendment protects
  against unreasonable searches and seizures; the FBI argues that
  cryptography will make investigation difficult, but the
  Constitution's intent is to make investigation of citizens
  difficult and subservient to our rights.  Forcing people to
  divulge keys as a precondition of communication is a violation of
  Fifth Amendment rights.
        The ability to wiretap did not exist at the time of the
  drafting of the Constitution -- there were no wires to tap, and
  hence communication was private.  A technological development
  made it easier for investigations to take place from the time of
  the development of the telephone until today -- encryption
  returns privacy to the status quo intended by the Founding
  Fathers.
        Further, no government agency has ever documented that
  encryption has made their work more difficult.  On average, 900
  wiretap warrants are issued per year; the government is arguing
  that telecommunications infrastructure must be redesigned to
  protect 900 wiretaps per year against a speculative danger. <p>

TECHNOLOGY <p>

WHO SHOULD KEEP THE KEYS? <p>

The U.S. government wants the power to tap into every phone, fax and
computer transmission <p>

BY PHILIP ELMER-DEWITT <p>

... (general background) <p>

... (general info on techo advances) <p>

Thus the stage was set for one of the most bizarre technology-policy
battles ever waged: the Clipper Chip war. Lined up on one side are the three-
letter cloak-and-dagger agencies -- the NSA, the CIA and the FBI -- and key
policymakers in the Clinton Administration (who are taking a surprisingly
hard line on the encryption issue). Opposing them is an equally unlikely
coalition of computer firms, civil libertarians, conservative columnists and
a strange breed of cryptoanarchists who call themselves the cypherpunks. <p>

At the center is the Clipper Chip, a semiconductor device that the NSA
developed and wants installed in every telephone, computer modem and fax
machine. The chip combines a powerful encryption algorithm with a ''back
door'' -- the cryptographic equivalent of the master key that opens
schoolchildren's padlocks when they forget their combinations. A ''secure''
phone equipped with the chip could, with proper authorization, be cracked by
the government. Law-enforcement agencies say they need this capability to
keep tabs on drug runners, terrorists and spies. Critics denounce the Clipper
-- and a bill before Congress that would require phone companies to make it
easy to tap the new digital phones -- as Big Brotherly tools that will strip
citizens of whatever privacy they still have in the computer age. <p>

In a Time/CNN poll of 1,000 Americans conducted last week by Yankelovich
Partners, two-thirds said it was more important to protect the privacy of
phone calls than to preserve the ability of police to conduct wiretaps. When
informed about the Clipper Chip, 80% said they opposed it. <p>

The battle lines were first drawn last April, when the Administration
unveiled the Clipper plan and invited public comment. For nine months
opponents railed against the scheme's many flaws: criminals wouldn't use
phones equipped with the government's chip; foreign customers wouldn't buy
communications gear for which the U.S. held the keys; the system for giving
investigators access to the back-door master codes was open to abuse; there
was no guarantee that some clever hacker wouldn't steal the keys. But in the
end the Administration ignored the advice. In early February, after computer-
industry leaders had made it clear that they wanted to adopt their own
encryption standard, the Administration announced that it was putting the NSA
plan into effect. Government agencies will phase in use of Clipper technology
for all unclassified communications. Commercial use of the chip will be
voluntary -- for now. <p>

It was tantamount to a declaration of war, not just to a small group of
crypto-activists but to all citizens who value their privacy, as well as to
telecommunications firms that sell their products abroad. Foreign customers
won't want equipment that U.S. spies can tap into, particularly since
powerful, uncompromised encryption is available overseas. ''Industry is
unanimous on this,'' says Jim Burger, a lobbyist for Apple Computer, one of
two dozen companies and trade groups opposing the Clipper. A petition
circulated on the Internet electronic network by Computer Professionals for
Social Responsibility gathered 45,000 signatures, and some activists are
planning to boycott companies that use the chips and thus, in effect, hand
over their encryption keys to the government. ''You can have my encryption

... (history of Public Key encryption). <p>

... (history of PGP) <p>

Rather than outlaw PGP and other such programs, a policy that would
probably be unconstitutional, the Administration is taking a marketing
approach. By using its purchasing power to lower the cost of Clipper
technology, and by vigilantly enforcing restrictions against overseas sales
of competing encryption systems, the government is trying to make it
difficult for any alternative schemes to become widespread. If Clipper
manages to establish itself as a market standard -- if, for example, it is
built into almost every telephone, modem and fax machine sold -- people who
buy a nonstandard system might find themselves with an untappable phone but
no one to call. <p>

That's still a big if. Zimmermann is already working on a version of PGP
for voice communications that could compete directly with Clipper, and if it
finds a market, similar products are sure to follow. ''The crypto genie is
out of the bottle,'' says Steven Levy, who is writing a book about
encryption. If that's true, even the nsa may not have the power to put it
back. <p>

SOME THOUGHTS ON CLIPPER, NSA, AND ONE KEY ESCROW ALTERNATIVE <p>

In a recent editorial, Dr. Dorothy Denning of Georgtown University
argued in support of the U.S. government's proposed Clipper Chip, a
security device that would allow law enforcement to decipher the
communications of users of such devices. <p>

Dr. Denning attempts to argue that Clipper is necessary for law
enforcement agencies to be able to do their job.  I'm not going to
argue that one; there are plenty of people who can argue that
compromising privacy for all citizens in order 	to aid law enforcement
is a bad idea more effectively than I, particularly in the Clipper
case, where the arguments from law enforcement are dubious at best.
(The current justification is inadequate; there may be better reasons,
from a law enforcement perspective, but we haven't heard them yet.) <p>

Without doubt, law enforcement and intelligence are huge stakeholders
in the debate over encryption. But every individual and corporation in
the U.S. must be included as well. Are NSA's actions really in the
best interests of all the stakeholders? Are there alternatives to the
current key escrow program? <p>

If one steps back and looks at what has happened over the last few
years, one might well question the government's approach with Clipper,
if not its motivation, for dealing with this problem.  (I believe it
may even be possible to conclude that Clipper is the visible portion
of a large-scale covert operation on U.S. soil by NSA, the National
Security Agency.) Over a number of years, through their subversion of
the Commerce Department (who should be championing the causes of U.S.
industry, not the intelligence agencies), NSA has managed to put many
U.S. government resources normally beyond their control, both legally
and practically, to work on their program of making U.S. and
international communications accessible. <p>

The first step was the MOU (Memorandum of Understanding) between the
Commerce Department's National Institute of Standards and Technology
(NIST) and the Defense Department's NSA.  This document appears to
contravene the provisions of the Computer Security Act of 1987, the
intent of which was to give NIST control over crypto standards-making
for the unclassified government and commercial sectors.  The MOU
essentially gave NSA a veto over any proposals for crypto standards by
NIST. <p>

By using the standards making authority of NIST, NSA is attempting to
force the entire U.S.  government to purchase Clipper equipment since
only NIST-standard equipment may be purchased by government agencies.
This purchasing power can then be used to force U.S. manufacturers to
build Clipper products or risk losing government business.  (GSA is
currently questioning NSA's authority to control government-wide
procurement, and should continue to do so.)  This of course not only
subsidizes Clipper products, but could make Clipper a de facto
standard if the costs associated with alternatives are too high.
These costs to industry, of ignoring Clipper, come in the form of lost
government market share, costly support for multiple versions of
incompatible products, and non-exportability of non-Clipper products. <p>

It also appears that NSA is desperately seeking a digital signature
standard that would force users to take that signature capability
wrapped up with a Clipper chip.  If this is the case, as it appears to
be, then NSA has is trying to use what is probably the most powerful
business tool of the information age as a means to deny us its
benefits unless we subsidize and accept Clipper in the process.  This
would, if true, be an unprecedented abuse of government power to
influence U.S.  industry and control individual privacy.  (Clipper is
part of a chip called Capstone, which is where their proposed digital
signature standard would be used.) <p>

The overall cost of these policies is unknown.  We only know that NSA
has spent a considerable amount of money on the program directly.
Other costs are not so obvious. They are: <p>

- A burdened U.S. industry, which will have to build multiple products
or more expensive products that support multiple techniques; <p>

- A low-intensity "trade war" with the rest of the world over
encryption; <p>

- Lost sales to U.S. companies, since international buyers will surely
go to non-U.S. suppliers for non- Clipper encryption, as may buyers in
the U.S.; <p>

- Potential abuses by government and loss of privacy for all citizens. <p>

Does NSA truly believe they can displace other methods with Clipper?
With over three million licensed, documented RSA products, the
technology they feel threatened by, in use in the U.S. today? Not
likely; therefore, they have already decided that these costs are
acceptable even if they only delay the inevitable, and that U.S.
industry and U.S. taxpayers should bear these costs, whatever they
are.  This policy was apparently developed by unelected people who
operate without oversight or accountability.  Does the White House
really support this policy? <p>

It has been reported that NSA is attempting to gain support from
foreign governments for escrow technology, especially if "local
control" is provided.  Even if NSA can convince their sister
organizations around the world to support key escrow (by offering
Clipper technology with a do-your-own-escrow option), will these other
organizations succeed in selling it to their government, industry and
citizens?  Most countries around the world have much stronger privacy
laws and a longer history of individual privacy than the U.S. <p>

WHY AGAIN WHEN IT DIDN'T WORK THE FIRST TIME? <p>

Many seem to have forgotten or are not aware that the Clipper program
is not new, and it's also not the first time NSA has attempted to
force communications security on U.S. industry that it could
compromise.  In the mid-80's, NSA introduced a program called the
Commercial COMSEC Endorsement Program, or CCEP. CCEP was essentially
Clipper in a black box, since the technology was not sufficiently
advanced to build lower-cost chips.  Vendors would join CCEP (with the
proper security clearances) and be authorized to incorporate
classified algorithms into communications systems.  NSA had proposed
that they themselves would actually provide the keys to end-users of
such systems.  The new twist is access by key escrow. <p>

To see how little things have changed, consider this quote: "...RSA
Data Security, Inc.  asserts that since CCEP-2 is not published and
therefore cannot be inspected by third parties, the NSA could put a
'trap door' in the algorithm that would enable the agency to inspect
information transmitted by the private sector.  When contacted, NSA
representative Cynthia Beck said that it was the agency's policy not
to comment on such matters."  That was in 1987. ("The Federal Snags in
Encryption Technology," Computer and Communications Decisions, July
1987, pp.  58-60.) <p>

To understand NSA's thinking, and the danger of their policies,
consider the reply of a senior NSA official when he was asked by a
reporter for the Wall Street Journal if NSA, through the CCEP program,
could read anyone's communications: "Technically, if someone bought
our device and we made the keys and made a copy, sure we could listen
in. But we have better things to do with our time." (The Wall Street
Journal, March 28, 1988, page 1, column 1, "A Supersecret Agency Finds
Selling Secrecy to Others Isn't Easy," by Bob Davis.) Another NSA
official, in the same Journal story, said "The American Public has no
problem with relying on us to provide the technology that prevents the
unauthorized launch of nuclear weapons. If you trust us to protect
against that, you can trust us to protect private records."  Remember
that the Cold War was still on at that time. <p>

Law enforcement and intelligence gathering are certainly impeded by
the use of cryptography.  There are certainly legitimate concerns that
these interests have.  But is the current approach really the way to
gain support from industry and the public?  People with a strong
military and intelligence bias are making all the decisions. There
seem to be better ways to strike a balance. <p>

AN ALTERNATIVE PROPOSAL <p>

One approach would be to have NIST develop a standard with three
levels.  The first level could specify the use of public-key for key
management and signatures without any key escrow.  There could be a
"Level II" compliance that adds government key escrow to message
preparation.  "Level III" could be key escrow controlled by the user,
typically a corporation.  Would this work? The first level, meeting
the standard by itself, would back up the government's claim that key
escrow is voluntary; if I want privacy and authentication without key
escrow, then I can have it, as the government has claimed I can.
Actions speak louder than words. <p>

Why would any vendors support Level II?  There would be several
reasons. They would find a market in the government, since the
government should purchase only Level II products. (I would certainly
like our public servants to use key escrow, just as I want work
product paid for by my corporation to be accessible. Of course, anyone
can buy Level I products for home and personal use.)  So the
government can still influence the private sector by buying only
products that include Level II compliance. Also, Level II products
would be decontrolled for export. This way the market can decide;
vendors will do what their customers tell them to.  This satisifies
the obvious desire on the part of the government to influence what
happens with their purchasing power. <p>

Level III would allow any user to insert escrow keys they control into
the process.  (Level II would not be a prerequisite to Level III.) My
company may want key escrow; I, as an individual, may want to escrow
my keys with my attorney or family members; a standard supporting
these funtions would be useful.  I don't necessarily want or need the
government involved. <p>

NIST already knows how to write a FIPS that describes software and
hardware implementations, and to certify that implementations are
correct. <p>

This approach cetainly isn't perfect, but if the administration really
believes what it says and means it, then I submit that this is an
improvement over a single key escrow FIPS foisted on everyone by NSA,
and would stand a much better chance of striking a workable balance
between the needs of the government and the right of individuals to
privacy.  Therefore, it RISKS much less than the current plan. <p>

The real problem with the way NSA works is that we don't find out what
they're really doing and planning for decades, even when they're
wrong.  What if they are? <p>

In the 60's and 70's, the CIA was out of control, and the Congress,
after extensive hearings that detailed some of the abuses of power by
the CIA, finally moved to force more accountability and oversight.  In
the 80's and 90's, NSA's activities should be equally scrutinized by a
concerned Congress. <p>

Subject: File 3--Dennings' Newsday piece is Convincing (Re CuD #6.20) <p>

I dunno, but I think the Encryption and Law Enforcement letter by
Dorothy Denning has convinced me that the Clipper Chip is safe.
Multiple people hold the keys to tapping the line and it has the
strongest encryption method created so far. I believed CUD earlier
that it was bad for the US, but now I see its advantages as long as
they don't outlaw other forms of encryption its okay with me. I mean,
its not like Big Brother can't tap into our line right now with us
knowing it! This technology isn't really new, its just a bit more
sophisticated and thats what scares us. Please tell me if I'm wrong!
As well as encryption, the clipper chip should also be modified to
give superior compression so more information can be sent over the
lines and during disaster they wouldn't be down. And as for the
Digital Telephony Bill, simple PGP encryption will scramble data
beyond recognition since it uses powerful public-key encryption. Sure,
this security might catch some, but some criminals they'll never be
able to catch anyways since they'll have the money to pay for even
more powerful encryption. I usually don't change my opinions easily so
it makes me wonder how many other people on the net have changed their
opinions also. <p>

&gt;                   The Clipper Chip Will Block Crime
&gt;                         By Dorothy E. Denning <p>

Before We go any further, let your old friend the Advocate join the
greek chorus,  of people singing their personal respect and admiration
for Dr Denning.  Her work in the Neidorf case was without par and her
commitment to issues in Cyberspace are intellectually rigorous and
passionate.  It thus doubly pains me when such an old and respected
friend seems to have gone astray. <p>

&gt;    Hidden among the discussions of the information highway is a fierce
&gt; debate, with huge implications for everyone.  It centers on a tiny
&gt; computer chip called the Clipper, which uses sophisticated coding to
&gt; scramble electronic communications transmitted through the phone
&gt; system. <p>

Just like other systems already in use for military and government
or commercial transactions. <p>

&gt;
&gt;    The Clinton administration has adopted the chip, which would allow
&gt; law enforcement agencies with court warrants to read the Clipper codes
&gt; and eavesdrop on terrorists and criminals.  But opponents say that, if <p>

or agencies with corrupt motives to spy on virtually every transaction
telephonic or datic  that moves on the information highway. <p>

future expansion of network systems will allow easy access to virtually
all data,  without regard,  and with intrusion, without detection. <p>

&gt; this happens, the privacy of law-abiding individuals will be a risk.
individuals and corporations. <p>

&gt; They want people to be able to use their own scramblers, which the
&gt; government would not be able to decode. <p>

WOuld not be able to decode?  no,  would not be able to decode without
spending some money.  Dr Denning forgets that we spend an estimated
$27 Billion dollars per year on the NSA,  an agency devoted entirely
to signals interception, decryption and analysis.  THis same agency
has been involved in the Clipper developement and has refused to make
any of it's files available and has instead crowded the field with
classified segments. <p>

&gt;    If the opponents get their way, however, all communications on the
&gt; information highway would be immune from lawful interception.  In a <p>

Hardly.  It merely means that interception would require either
more detailed de-crpyption efforts  or attack at sources of
transmission or reception. <p>

These same complaints are repackaged complaints about miranda rights,
the exclusionary rule and every other legal reform of this century. <p>

&gt; world threatened by international organized crime, terrorism, and rogue
&gt; governments, this would be folly.  In testimony before Congress, Donald <p>

International organised crime?  you mean like the Mafia,  whom the
CIA helped set up?  and who work routinely as government agents? <p>

Terrorism?  in this country of 250 million people less the 15 people
per year die on average from terrorist activities.  considering
50,000 americans die every year on the roads,  someone needs to get
their priorities re-aligned. <p>

Rogue governments?  like the libyans, or Iraq and iran?  how will clipper
harm a foreign government?  not to mention these countries are all
paper tigers.  the last time we dealt with traq,  i seem to recall
we waxed their army without breaking a sweat.  i am not worried. <p>

&gt; Delaney, senior investigator with the New York State Police, warned
&gt; that if we adopted an encoding standard that did not permit lawful
&gt; intercepts, we would have havoc in the United States. <p>

But don forgets  that his standard allows un-lawful intercepts. <p>

lets look at this word havoc.  that means a state of chaos or confusion.
If i go to anacostia on a friday night, i would say havoc exists. if i
go into a DC school by day, i could say havoc exists.  when  LA burned
last year havoc ran rampant,  and certainly this had little to do
with the lack of a proper data encryption standard.  The operation
of the polis has little to do with the effectiveness of our secret
police. <p>

&gt;
&gt;    Moreover, the Clipper coding offers safeguards against casual
&gt; government intrusion.  It requires that one of the two components of <p>

Not neccesarily.  Although Dr denning and a team of independent
scientists reviewed the clipper standard,  they are not specialists
in code breaking.  I do not know how immune clipper is to corruption
once partial knowledge is attained.  knowledge of header blocks,
and access to partial keys and key fragments may make closure of
the cryptic circle a simpler proposition then her analysis indicated. <p>

&gt; a key embedded in the chip be kept with the Treasury Department and the <p>

The dept that brought us the Secret service and the ATF?  i don't think
so. <p>

&gt; other component with the Commerce Department's National Institute of
&gt; Standards and Technology.  Any law enforcement official wanting to <p>

who work hand in glove with the NSA?
she forgets a single compromised official may be able to subvert
the entire system as mr Ames so easily demonstrated last week. <p>

&gt; wiretap would need to obtain not only a warrant but the separate
&gt; components from the two agencies.  This, plus the superstrong code and
&gt; key system would make it virtually impossible for anyone, even corrupt
&gt; government officials, to spy illegally. <p>

I think this is optimism in action. <p>

&gt;    But would terrorists use Clipper?  The Justice Department has
would Clipper stop terrorism?  Seriously can anyone guarantee
that this technology will end terrorism?  will clipper end
drug trafficking? <p>

&gt; their calls with their own code systems.  But then who would have
&gt; thought that the World Trade Center bombers would have been stupid
&gt; enough to return a truck that they had rented? <p>

Considering the people who bomber the world trade center were keystone
terrorists, i would hardly hold them up as examples. <p>

I would look at people like Carlos the Jackal,  THe Red Army,
Black September, Islamic Jihad, etc...
These are highly sophisticated, well trained killers,  and far more
effective and dangerous. <p>

&gt;    Court-authorized interception of communications has been essential
&gt; for preventing and solving many serious and often violent crimes, <p>

for all the crime and violence in our society, i doubt law enforcement
is doing a good job.  what we see is another band-aid on serious social
problems. <p>

&gt; including terrorism, organized crime, drugs, kidnaping, and political
&gt; corruption.  The FBI alone has had many spectacular successes that
&gt; depended on wiretaps.  In a Chicago case code-named RUKBOM, they
&gt; prevented the El Rukn street gang, which was acting on behalf of the
&gt; Libyan government, from shooting down a commercial airliner using a
&gt; stolen military weapons system. <p>

Dr Dennings faith is touching here.  The El Rukns  were done in
in part because the government compromised their lawyer.  And also
had several agents inside the organization.  Please a better example
must be out there. <p>

&gt;    To protect against abuse of electronic surveillance, federal
&gt; statutes impose stringent requirements on the approval and execution
&gt; of wiretaps.  Wiretaps are used judiciously (only 846 installed
&gt; wiretaps in 1992) and are targeted at major criminals. <p>

and how many wiretaps are installed il-legally?  considering during the
gulf war the FBI was wire-tapping the homes  of arab-americans
i wonder how well they use the legal process. <p>

also if we are talking 846 wiretaps,  and say, 200 hours of tape
from each, we are talking about 200,000 hours of conversation.
i am certain that the NSA has the facility to de-crypt this number
of calls.  And if they don't why don't they?  they must listen to
foreign conversations,  and i am sure the russians are not so
accomodating as to use clear voice signaling. <p>

&gt;    Now, the thought of the FBI wiretapping my communications appeals to
&gt; me about as much as its searching my home and seizing my papers.
&gt; But the Constitution does not give us absolute privacy from
&gt; court-ordered searches and seizures, and for good reason.  Lawlessness
&gt; would prevail. <p>

But the constitution does not forbid me from keeping safes,  or
cryptic records  or speaking in navajo,  either.  Dr Denning must have
far less faith in the body politic then I do.  besides if you want
to see lawlessness,  look at the beltway on friday afternoon. <p>

&gt;    Encoding technologies, which offer privacy, are on a collision
&gt; course with a major crime-fighting tool: wiretapping.  Now the <p>

wiretapping is a minor crime fighting tool.  for all the law enforcement
personnell we have, and all the cases brought each year,  less then 1%
involve wiretapping to start with.  these same complaints  have been
made about facsimile transmission,  computer data, cell phones
and cars.  technology changes and law enforcement adapts.  this is the
first time, i have ever seen law enforcement try to cripple a technology
befoe it becomes prevalent. <p>

ASk yourself a question Dr Denning.  Cars are used in crime, criminals
often escape from the police.  why shouldn't all cars be restricted
to 35MPH, by design so the police can always capture and pursue?
fast cars, like the ferrari  have not brought chaos to our society.
why should cryptography? <p>

&gt; Clipper chip shows that strong encoding can be made available in a way
&gt; that protects private communications but does not harm society if it
&gt; gets into the wrong hands.  Clipper is a good idea, and it needs <p>

how will clipper prevent the wrong hands from getting strong encoding?
will only outlaws have strong crypto? <p>

&gt; support from people who recognize the need for both privacy and
&gt; effective law enforcement on the information highway. <p>

sure we need law enforcement on the info highway,  but i don't
need a trooper in the back seat to listen to me talk to
my girlfirend as we drive.  i just need a trooper to watch for
speeders and drunk drivers. <p>

Dr Denning was part of the clipper review team,  and as such
may be psychologically and emotionally committed to the project.
I hope her earlier effort shave not clouded her ability to conduct a
dispassionate social and policy analysis. <p>

Also  Louis Freeh  was interviewed by John Markoff in an article in
todays NYT about the return of the Digital Telephony Standard.
Freeh said "If we are to have a peaceful and orderly society,
people will have to sacrifice a little privacy".  I couldn't
believe this.  Didn't  jefferson say something on the lines of
those who sacrifice liberty for a little peace deserve neither?
or was that heinlein? <p>

The other interesting factoid to counter all the discussion on
Terrorism,  Nuclear death threats and Drug Dealing, is that
Aldrich Ames was arrested last week in the biggest spy scandal
this century since the Rosenbergs.  Ames who was the CIA chief of
CounterIntelligence/Soviet-Eastern Division was as well trained in
tradecraft as one can be. <p>

He never used any telephonic encryption, despite total access to
all these devices. <p>

Sorry if the spys aren't using them,  then why do we need a
way to break them? <p>

Subject: File 5--Newsday's Encryption and Law Enforcement (Re: CuD 6.19) <p>

With all due respect to Professor Denning, I offer the following
observations in response to the material in her recent posting. <p>

1. Professor Denning's views are representative of a small minority in
the US academic community.  However, through her energetic campaign to
promote pro-Clipper arguments, a casual observer of the debate would
conclude that her position is representative of a substantial segment of
academic opinion.  This was especially evident in the ACM Communications
"dialogue" on Clipper, in which Professor Denning's comments occupied
almost half of the editorial space. <p>

2. Professor Denning's efforts to advance her views are not limited to
journalistic advocacy and Usenet postings.  Her presence on the ACM
committee studying Clipper has contributed to the success of the
pro-Clipper faction in deadlocking the committee, and thus preventing
the largest computing professional society from taking an anti-Clipper
position, a position that would reflect the sentiments of the majority
of the membership. <p>

3. Professor Denning consistently makes generous assumptions about the
proper and lawful actions of government officials - assumptions that
anyone familiar with recent American history knows to be naive.  For
example, the political manipulation of information gathered by J. Edgar
Hoover, former Director of the F.B.I. is common knowledge. <p>

4. Professor Denning relies heavily on anecdotal evidence of crimes
"prevented" through communications intercepts without presenting accurate
data on the (very small) number of crimes in which the intercept was
essential to the success of law enforcement.  Others have posted the
figures, and they suggest that the practical value of such intercepts is
greatly overstated. <p>

5. Professor Denning maintains that secure encryption is a difficult
technology to master and is not readily available to the general public.
In view of the existence of PGP, and the likely availability of its
voice-scrambling successor, this is a ludicrous claim. <p>

6. Professor Denning offers no explanation for how a US national
standard restricting encryption can be viable in the context of
worldwide voice and data communications.  How can the US government
possibly assert control of information packets crossing US "cyberspace?" <p>

7. Professor Denning omits to mention that polls reveal that the
majority of the US public are opposed to telephone wiretaps.  All
available evidence suggests that Clipper would never survive a public
referendum. <p>

8. Professor Denning neglects to mention that the entire commercial
sector of the US computing industry is united in opposition to Clipper.
Moreover, much of the business community is also hostile to the concept
of Government interception of business communications. <p>

9. Professor Denning's arguments are ultimately authoritarian.  She
believes that the judgement of government officials must carry greater
weight than the will of the people.  This is a profoundly
anti-democratic position. <p>

Subject: File 6--DOS is not dead yet. . . . <p>

Is DOS dead?  Definitely not, says SPC <p>

While millions of PC users own and use Windows regularly, many of
us grouse about its idiosyncrasies. Meanwhile, innumerable users
continue to use DOS applications, especially word processing programs. <p>

The DOS flavors of WordPerfect (versions 5.0 and later) have
their legions of fans, along with Microsoft Word, WordStar and
Professional Write. Although I use Ami Pro for Windows, I also
occasionally use Professional Write (Ver. 2.2) which has been around
for several years. <p>

Although WordPerfect users often turn up their noses at
Professional Write, I have always preferred ProWrite to
Word(not-so)Perfect. In fact, I never could understand why Software
Publishing Corp. (SPC) didn't update the program. They did come out
with a Windows version (Professional Write PLUS), but it didn't sell
very well. <p>

Professional Write 3.0 is finally here, and should be in software
stores soon. "This new version was primarily driven by the large
number of customers who requested it," said Chris Randles, SPC's vice
president of marketing. It seems a bit overpriced (at $249 list) for a
program that has had only a modest facelift/update, though. <p>

Randles said that "DOS word processing is one of the most widely
used applications in rapidly-growing niche markets such as small
business and the home office."  In that market, PC users don't want to
mess around with memory problems, Windows GPFs (General Protection
Faults), or word processing programs that have become monster
applications akin to desktop publishing software. <p>

Professional Write 3.0 is pretty much the same program, so the
learning curve is nil.  There are some improvements that reflect the
changing PC arena.  Now you can use a mouse; I missed having that
feature in Ver. 2.2.  And SPC realizes that LANs are routine now, so
made it network-ready.  The program supports Novell, IBM, Banyan,
Artisoft's LANtastic and Microsoft LAN Manager. <p>

Marlise Parker of Ad Hoc Associates, a Denver-based computer
training and consulting firm, noted that "people are going back to the
belief that the finest things in life are the most simple, and for
many of us, that also applies to the software we use.  Professional
Write is one of those rare software gems that keeps getting better,
without losing its simplicity," Parker added. <p>

Want to import .PCX graphics into a document?  Sorry, you can't
do it. You CAN include graphs produced with the DOS versions of
Harvard Graphics (2.0 or higher). Want to make fancy newsletters and
DTP documents? Forget it! SPC wisely decided to forego the "bells and
whistles," says Parker, because most users don't want or need them. <p>

Software Publishers Association (SPA) reported recently that DOS
word processing software sales increased a bit in 1993 over 1992.
This occurred while sales of other DOS applications declined, as the
Windows Juggernaut continued. <p>

So as far as word processing is concerned, rumors about the death
of DOS are greatly exaggerated. Remember, the most popular offline
mail readers are Blue Wave, Silver Xpress and OLX--all DOS programs.
Professional Write 3.0 should do well, I think. I would have liked to
have seen it at a $150 list price, however. <p>

Fridrik:
 It seems to me that one of the purposes of creating anti-virus software
is to combat viruses. *ahem* What better way to do so than to receive virus
programs from a "tester" and then write code to prevent similar
programs from proliferating from a less honest individual? <p>

I don't see any validity in the argument against writing viruses
to be sent into anti-virus software companies. If these people
don't write test viruses, someone else will come up with similar
ones and use them unscrupulously. <p>

If anti-virus companies are receiving "too many" new viruses every
day, then perhaps they need to deal with the backlog. A representative
such as yourself (I take it from your statementd that you work
with such a company) certainly shouldn't be ranting and raving at
people who are using their valuable time trying to help. <p>

Re:  Media "Hackers" Whack Harding's E-Mail,  CuD #6.19: <p>

&gt;     LILLEHAMMER, Norway--In what was described as a "stupid,
&gt;     foolish mistake," perhaps as many as 100 American
&gt;     journalists peeked into figure skater Tonya Harding's
&gt;     private electronic mailbox at the Olympics. <p>

++++++++++++++++ <p>

This story was mentioned on alt.2600 (an Internet news group dedicated
to the magazine "2600").  It annoys me now as much as when I first
read it.  Here is the follow up I posted: <p>

Well, I personally know many hackers who have entered systems with
 someone elses password, looked around, and logged out.  Did nothing
 more.  They all lost *all* their computer equipment, and many
 non-computer related items, not to mention the thousands of dollars
 in lawyer and court costs, just to get the felony and misd charges
 slapped on them lowered to a misd. <p>

These reporters have just admitted to committing the exact same
 crime.  Will they have all their equipment confiscated?  Will they be
 raided by the secret service with guns pointed at their mothers at
 5am?  I think not. <p>

What a bunch of shit. <p>

Even if Norway's computer crime laws do not apply here, and the
Olympic committee does not wish to take action against these
reporters, it really makes me sick that THESE hackers are given the
image of some responsible adults just having fun at 2AM while eating
pizza, while the other hackers you read about are juvenile delinquents
bent on moving satellites out of orbit and abusing the E911 system. <p>

Just a hypothetical thought:  What would have happened if a US hacker
was the one who broke into Harding's account instead of one of these
journalists? <p>

Subject: File 9--"Porn Press Release" from EFF is a Hoax <p>

At EFF, we have been receiving a number of queries about an alleged EFF
"press release" or "statement" announcing the following: <p>

"Senator Jess Helms (R-NC) requested that the FBI become more involved in
the fight to stop adult images from being distributed on electronic
bulletin boards and the Internet." <p>

Typically, the "press release" has included the following: <p>

: "The EFF has issued a warning to sysops that the following files
: which depict any of the following acts are illegal in all 50
: states, and can subject the sysop to prosecution regardless of
: whether the sysop knows about the files or not.
:
: "--Depiction of actual sex acts in progress"
:
: "--Depiction of an erect penis" <p>

*There is no such press release.* <p>

*The press release is a hoax.* <p>

Several people seem to have been fooled by the false press release,
including the new publication SYSOP NEWS, which reprinted it uncritically
in its first issue. <p>

I urge you to spread this announcement to every BBS of which you a member. <p>

Thank you for helping us stop the unethical people who spread this
misinformation. <p>

I promised no more clipper unless important. this is from the The mini-Journal of Irreproducible Results ("mini-JIR") Issue Number 1994-03 <p>

1994-03-04      Clipper Chip Envelope, Initiative, and Economics <p>

CLIPPER CHIP ENVELOPE
Soon the government-mandated Clipper Chip secret-code-decoder will be
installed in every piece of US electronic communications equipment.
Criminals might then try to send their coded messages via traditional
mail. Against that possibility, we are now applying Clipper Chip
protection to paper mail. Our Clipper Chip Envelope automatically reads
and decodes any paper enclosed in it. The Clipper Chip Envelope consists
of a standard paper envelope with an installed optical scanner and
microprocessor, optical character recognition software, a passive
transmitter, and a Clipper Chip. The whole mechanism is the size and
value of a fingernail clipping. Ee-way are-ay aking-may is-thay
echnology-tay available-ay oo-tay any-ay official-ay agency-ay ich-way
an-cay ecode-day is-they essage-may, free of charge. <p>

CLIPPER CHIP INTERNATIONAL SCIENCE INITIATIVE
The Society for Basic Irreproducible Research (SBIR) strongly supports
the basic Clipper Chip requirement. Oxymoronically, it will cause US
encryption research to quickly lag behind that of other countries. We
see this as a boost to the international science community, which has
suffered so long from the domination of US researchers in too many
fields. <p>

CLIPPER CHIP ECONOMICS
An historical note: It was we who performed the economic analysis for
the government's Clipper Chip decision. Decoding requires too much
mathematical effort and talent, a considerable expense even during the
current mathematicians glut. With declining math skills in the US, the
cost of encryption research can be expected to rise further. In the long
run, it will be much cheaper to bribe appropriate officials in the
countries that do continue to perform research. <p>

strange but interesting --  - A tekkie counterculture is born  By Paul Saffo <p>

Cyberpunk R.I.P. <p>

- A tekkie counterculture is born
        By Paul Saffo <p>

Like a sun-grazing comet on a deep-space trajectory, the cyberpunk
   movement is disappearing as quickly as it arrived just a few years
   ago. Moreover, the movement was hardly more substantial than a comet's
   fuzzy tail when it came to numbers - there were never more than 100
   hard-core cyberpunks at any time before the term hit the mainstream
   press. <p>

But don't sell cyberpunks's social impact short, for insubstantial
   comets have long served as messengers. I suspect that cyberpunks are
   to the 1990s what the beatniks were to the '60s - harbingers of a mass
   movement waiting in the wings. Just as the beatniks anticipated the
   hippies, cyberpunks are setting the stage for a coming digital
   counterculture that will turn the '90s zeitgeist utterly on its head.
   This movement in the making has yet to be described, much less named,
   but eerie parallels between the beatnik and cyberpunk movements offer
   strong hints of what is to come. <p>

For starters, both movements were given focus by literary fiction. The
   beatniks took their cue from a handful of "beat writers" (Jack
   Kerouac, Alan Ginsberg, Gregory Corso, and William S. Burroughs),
   while cyberpunks found their identity in the cyberpunk science ction
   genre dened by writers such as William Gibson, Rudy Rucker, Bruce
   Sterling, and John Shirley. Moreover, the lead works in both
   traditions orbited emerging infrastructures: Kerouac's On the Road
   played off the concrete mobility enabled by the Interstate Highway
   Act, while Gibson's Neuromancer portrayed a future world wrapped
   around vast information highways. Eager readers never realized that
   neither writer was really one of them: Kerouac disliked driving;
   Gibson banged out Neuromancer on a 1927 Hermes typewriter. <p>

Like the cyberpunks, there were never more than a handful of true
   beatniks - less than 120 in all before the movement hit the media in
   the late 1950s, according to essayist George Leonard. Leonard's
   descriptions of the North Beach beatnik milieu parallel today's
   cyberpunk culture. Word got out on the grapevine of parties at
   people's "pads," and, like raves, these happenings quickly evolved
   into underground quasi-commercial events. Just as cyberpunks carry
   their network identities into the physical world, the beatniks were
   fond of pseudonyms. "Everyone had a name, like in a Damon Runyon
   novel," observes Leonard. Ironically, neither group named its own
   movement, for just as the cyberpunks were so dubbed by a literary
   interloper, the term "beatnik" was coined by San Francisco Chronicle
   columnist Herb Caen. <p>

Once labeled, both movements quickly surrendered their visual
   archetypes to the cultural mainstream. In 1960, youths the world over
   were aping the goateed, cool-shades beatnik look, while today, PDBs
   (people dressed in black) affecting electronic lifestyles are more
   numerous than network nodes. This surrender would send both movements
   into the black hole of history, but not before they inspired larger
   movements to come. Just ve years after the beatniks's demise in 1960,
   the hippies emerged from the Haight-Ashbury to change our cultural
   landscape forever. <p>

Like cyberpunks, the beatniks were for the most part low-key, slightly
   mournful loners. Beatnik individualism was a sullen and stubborn
   reaction to the optimistic company-man materialism of the Eisenhower
   era, just as the cyberpunks stand in stark contrast to the antiseptic
   military- industrial orderliness of the Reagan-Bush years. <p>

But Kerouac later concluded that beat also meant beatific - imbued
   with joy or blessedness - and it was this aspect of the beatniks that
   became the germ of the hippie movement, according to Leonard. "It was
   a time of grace," he told me, referring to the early days of the
   Haight-Ashbury, when it seemed that a new age of cultural
   consciousness truly was dawning. <p>

Optimism and a sense of community distinguished the hippies from the
   beatniks, and will also distinguish the cyberpunks from the coming
   digital counterculture. The cyberpunk world is starkly non-utopian,
   serving up the same sort of intimate but uneasy accommodation with
   technology portrayed in the movie Blade Runner. I will bet that the
   digital counterculture will reject this bleak vision of a future in
   which technology enlarges the human spirit as a new tool for
   consciousness in much the same way that the hippies appropriated the
   psychoactive chemical spinoffs of the military- industrial complex.
   This new movement will be cyberpunk imbued with human warmth,
   substituting a deep sense of interdependence in place of lone-wolf
   isolationism. Cyberpunks envision humans as electronic cyber-rats
   lurking in the interstices of the information mega-machine; the gospel
   of the post- cyberpunk movement will be one of machines in the service
   of enlarging our humanity. <p>

It is too early to tell what the digital counterculture will call
   itself, but the history of the hippies offers a clue. "Hippie" traces
   its origins to "hipster," slang for a cruel and cynical 1950s
   subculture that predated the beats. The digital counterculture thus is
   likely to appropriate an older term for its own, in the same way that
   the hippies appropriated and turned "hipster" into something entirely
   new. I'll bet that they call themselves something like "tekkies,"
   consciously adopting the scornful '80s slang for nerds, stripping the
   word of its industrial coldness and making it synonymous with the
   human control of technology. <p>

Hippies appeared in 1965, several years after the beatnik movement had
   gone public. Given this chronology, the tekkies will arrive sometime
   in the mid- 1990s, if not sooner. Watch the skies for a new comet - it
   will be digital, and its tail is likely to glow in Technicolor swirls.
   Its arrival will change our lives forever. <p>

Speaking truth to power
        By Bruce Sterling <p>

Earlier this year, Bruce Sterling testied before the House
   Subcommittee on Telecommunications and Finance in Washington, DC. This
   is the transcript of his remarks. <p>

_*Hello everyone and thanks for inviting me here. My name is Bruce
   Sterling and I'm a science-fiction writer and sometime science
   journalist. Since writing my nonction book Hacker Crackdown: Law and
   Disorder on the Electronic Frontier, I have returned to writing
   science ction. And I've returned to that with some relief, frankly,
   since the world of science ction is in most ways rather less strange
   and less bizarre than the contemporary world of telecommunications
   policy. <p>

I hope therefore that you will forgive me if I testify today as a
   science- fiction writer. It's one of the perks of my profession to
   write about the future, or attempt to, and I thought you might like to
   meet someone from the telecommunications future that you are so busy
   creating. <p>

With your kind indulgence for my novelist's whimsy then, the rest of
   my brief presentation today will be given by a Mr. Bob Smith, who is
   an NREN network administrator from the year 2015. I present Mr.
   Smith.*_ <p>

Thank you, Mr. Sterling. It's a remarkable privilege to talk to the
   legislators who historically created my working environment. As a
   laborer in the elds of 21st-century cyberspace, I of course would have
   no job without NREN. My wife and small son and I are all properly
   grateful for your foresight in establishing the information
   superhighway. <p>

Your actions in this regard have affected American society every bit
   as strongly as did the telegraph, the railroads, the telephone, the
   highway system, and television. In fact, it's impossible for me to
   imagine contemporary life in 2015 without the global Net; living
   without the Net would be like trying to live without electricity. <p>

However, it's a truism in technological development that no silver
   lining comes without its cloud. Today, I'd like to mention two or
   three trifling problems that were not entirely obvious from the
   perspective of the early 1990s. <p>

First, a word about this "research and education" issue. Because
   communications is power in an information society, giving
   fantastically advanced communications to the research and education
   communities did in fact empower those communities quite drastically by
   comparison with interest groups lacking that advantage. Today, one of
   the most feared political organizations in the world is the
   multi-national anarchist libertarian group called the Students for an
   Utterly Free Society. <p>

Of course, there have always been campus radicals, but thanks to their
   relative lack of nancial clout, and lack of even a steady home
   address, these young fanatics once found it very difcult to organize
   politically. Therefore, they were easy for the powers-that-be to
   ignore, except during occasional spasms of violent campus unrest. <p>

Thanks to NREN, however, spasms of student unrest can now spread like
   lightning across entire continents. Advanced Articial Intelligence
   (AI) translation programs installed on the Net only made matters
   worse, because in 2015 the global leaders of the student movements are
   not only extremely radical, but French. <p>

Attempts by campus authorities to control this unrest have failed
   miserably. In 2015, NREN sites are always the rst buildings occupied
   during a campus strike. Campus chancellors and faculty are themselves
   so utterly dependent on NREN that they become quite helpless offline. <p>

A second major problem has been the growth of unlicensed encryption,
   which has proven quite unstoppable. Today, some 75 percent of NREN
   archives is material that no one in authority can read. Countries that
   attempted to control and monitor network trafc have lost market share
   and service revenue as data processing simply moves offshore. <p>

The United States has profited by this phenomenon to a great extent as
   people worldwide have flocked to the relative liberty of our networks.
   Unfortunately, many of these electronic virtual immigrants are not
   simply dissidents looking for free expression, but in fact are
   organized criminals. <p>

Take for instance a recent FBI raid on an enormous archive of
   encrypted Iranian files, illicitly stored in an obscure NREN node in
   North Dakota. Luckily, the FBI was able to decrypt these les thanks to
   an informant. Deciphering these archives revealed the following
   contraband:
    * 80 percent graphic image files of attractive young women without
      veils or, in fact, much clothing of any kind.
    * 15 percent digitally stored pirated copies of Western pop music and
      Western videos, still illegal to possess in Tehran.
    * And, 5 percent text files in the Farsi language describing how to
      build, deliver, and park truck-bombs in major urban areas. <p>

I can't conclude my brief remarks today without a mention of a
   particularly odd development related to wireless computer
   telecommunications. Because it is now possible to carry out
   transactions entirely in cyberspace (including nancial transactions),
   many information entrepreneurs in 2015 have simply given up any
   physical home. Basically, they have become stateless people,
   21st-century gypsies. <p>

A recent tragic example of this occurred in the small town of North
   Zulch, Texas. There, some rural law enforcement ofcers apprehended a
   scruffy vagabond on a motorcycle after a high-speed chase.
   Unfortunately he was killed. A search of his backpack revealed a
   device the size of a cigarette pack. The police ofcers, who were not
   computer literate, accidentally broke the device. This tiny device was
   actually a privately owned computer bulletin board system with some
   15,000 registered users. <p>

Many of the users were wealthy celebrities, and the apparent outlaw
   biker was actually an extremely popular and nationally known system
   operator. These 15,000 users were enraged by what they considered the
   wanton destruction of their electronic community. They pooled their
   resources and took a terrible vengeance on the small town of North
   Zulch, which, by contrast, had only 2,000 residents, none of them
   wealthy or technologically sophisticated. Through a combination of
   harassing lawsuits and sharp real- estate deals, the vengeful board
   users bankrupted the town. Eventually the entire township was
   bulldozed flat and purchased for park land by the Nature Conservancy. <p>

Thanks in part to the advances that you yourselves set in motion,
   violent conflicts between virtual and actual communities have become a
   permanent feature of the cultural landscape in 2015. <p>

Good articles on technology <p>

A couple of good articles ...
(Also, you're going to cover digital telephony, arent you?)
Also, read the Walker article in 3 parts (Farber's readings), it has
stuff on technology which you could cover.

HEADLINE: F.B.I. to 'dumb down' telecom equipment: proposed legislation has
unsettling implications for future of digital media; fears of inability to tap
computer conversationsincludes related articles on digital communications,
regulation proposal <p>

BYLINE: Caruso, Denise <p>

BODY:
    Proposed legislation has <p>

unsetting implications for <p>

future of digital media <p>

It is an unfortunate trait of humankind that we often do not note our
watershed events until history has recorded their aftermath. <p>

The transition to digital technology that we are facing today is one of
those watersheds. Almost every vendor in every area of computing, consumer
electronics, data communication and telecommunication is looking at new ways to
transmit digital information, either over wires or through the airwaves. What
we are witnessing., whether we know it yet or not, is the building of a vast
global network, with new foundations and new paradigms for communication and
commerce. <p>

Safe and reasonable commerce <p>

Large pan-industry investments (like the ones mentioned in "A Tremendous
Blossoming," p. 9) are being made based on the assumption that such commerce
can and will be conducted in a safe and reasonable manner over networks. <p>

But that assumption is in question today. People who attended the second
annual Computers, Freedom and Privacy (CFP-2) conference in Washington DC late
last month were shocked to read copies of a legislative proposal instigated by
the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation called "Digital Telephony." The
proposed bill, which could be tacked on as an amendment to an existing bill, is
presently being sponsored by Ernest Hollings, the Democratic senator from South
Carolina and chairman of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and
Transportation. <p>

Should government dictate product design? The proposal apparently sprang
forth from the FBI's concern that it cannot keep up with digital communications
technology, especially in the area of wiretap. The agency believes_that as
signals sent over telephone lines become digital, it will be incapable of
finding and recording the conversations that it is legally entitled to
intercept.  PAGE 63
                         Digital Media, April 20, 1992 <p>

To avoid this scenario, the F.B.I. is processing that the U.S. Federal
Communications Commissions and the U.S. Attorney General's office be given the
power to "determine" the technological interception needs of the government"
and issue regulations about how vendors must comply - specifically to allow the
F.B.I. (and other agencies like the National Security Agency) unimpeded access
to all digital communications. <p>

In other words, the FCC would be given authority to dictate product design
in this fundamental regard. If such regulations are passed, vendors would have
180 days to comply. If they do not, they can be charged and fined $ 10,000 per
day for each day in violation. <p>

Faster police cars <p>

Even more incredibly, the proposed legislation decrees that any FCC
proceeding regarding design regulations, standards or registrations issued to
equipment vendors will be closed to the public and conducted in secret. <p>

The proposal has the potential to affect every single area touched by
digital media. It does not just limit the FCC's authority to traditional
telephones and newer digital telephony technology. It would affect all kinds of
computer communication, and likely radio communications as well. <p>

Of course, one of the big questions is how far "wiretap" extends into the
realm of non-voice digital communications - i.e., e-mail, document and file
transfer, the transmission of sound and video information - which are
increasingly in use today. Do files downloaded from the Internet constitute a
type of communication the F.B.I. needs to monitor? <p>

Those who've studied the proposal believe the answer is yes, in which case
it will affect everyone from standard computer network providers, who often
connect customers to the outside world via telephone lines and equipment, to
banks, whose automatic teller machines must use secure data lines to transmit
financial and customer identification information, and companies like Apple
Computer, now in the process of developing an entire lie of personal
communication devices. <p>

If encryption is outlawed ... As more proprietary information is sent over
networks, and as more systems are compromised by crackers, viruses and
electronic eavesdroppers, equipment and software vendors as mainstream as Apple
and Microsoft have begun incorporating high levels of security into their
systems via encryption. <p>

Cellular phone makers are doing the same thing. And as wireless
communication traffic increases, one can expect that powerful security and
 encryption products will only become more popular, since more people will have
access to interception technologies. <p>

Though not specifically listed as a target in the proposal, many people are
calling Digital Telephony "Son of S. 266," a failed Senate bill that required
the same "dumbing-down" for encryption as the F.B.I. proposal does for phone
systems. In other words, makers of encryption devices or software were to be
required to leave a "back door" open for law -enforcement and security agencies
that wanted to decode encrypted communication.  PAGE 64
                         Digital Media, April 20, 1992 <p>

The bill, of course, completely defeats the purpose of encryption - leaving
the "back door" open for the very same sophisticated techno-criminals that the
agencies were trying to thwart. S. 266 was shouted down last year by outraged
computer experts and civil libertarians. <p>

At the CFP conference, encryption expert Whitfield Diffie said, "I
understand why the police don't like encryption . But a very large part of the
essence of a free versus totalitarian society consists of the difference
between being answerable for your actions and being subject to prior restraint
against actions the society doesn't approve of." <p>

Making economic policy. Jim Bidzos, president of RSA Data Security, a
public-key encryption firm, says the issue is both personal privacy and
national competitiveness. The long-term effect of anti- encryption and related
 legislation is far worse than anything we've seen to date. <p>

"One could argue that economic policy is being made by the intelligence
agencies," he said during a CFP panel on encryption.  "That's not a good idea." <p>

What's happening, he says, is that electronic commerce is driving industry
and government into an adversarial role regarding encryption and data
protection. "Crypto is moving into mainstream products, and people who are
doing so now will want to continue," he says. "Government keeps trying to slip
language into bills that weakens their ability to do so. They need to stop
doing that. <p>

"What we really need is a national policy review - a Computer Security Act
advisory board to Congress. It's the single more important thing we can do.
We're long overdue to get some rational policy that will work for all of us." <p>

How about cable? Satellite? <p>

Cellular? <p>

But back to the F.B.I. proposal. Would the bill also have to restrict cable
equipment, also capable of digital tele-communicati on? The cellular phone and
data networks? Satellite communications? If monitoring of communications is
what the F.B.I. is interested in, the way the industry is moving today would
certainly indicate that any conduit of digital information would need to be
"tappable." <p>

Jerry Berman, director of the EFF's Washington DC office, certainly
believes that particular threat is implied. "It's one thing to get cooperation
from a phone company," he says. "It's another thing to go to CompuServe and
say, We want to tap into electronic mail.' Or We want to know, when you're
tapping into the line between EFF's Cambridge; whose data, voice, video is on
that line.  What's in the packet? It's getting much more complicated to
distinguish between different kinds of messages and different parties who are
being bundled together. Any kind of dumbing-down to separate that out is
contraintuitive to the most efficient use of this technology." <p>

As a Washington Post op-ed piece stated, the proposal is "an assault on
progress, on scientific endeavor and on the competitive position of American
industry. It's comparable to requiring Detroit to produce only automobiles that
can be overtaken by faster police cars." <p>

PAGE 65
                         Digital Media, April 20, 1992 <p>

The trouble with tapping <p>

It's true that the complexity of digital technology will make it harder, or
even impossible, for law enforcement to conduct its wiretaps in the manner to
which it has become accustomed. The prospect of techno-terrorists being able to
use computers and sophisticated encryption techniques to thwart
 law -enforcement officials is a frightening one. <p>

But it is important to remember that technology itself is never the
problem.  Technology only holds a magnifying glass to problems that already
exist, and the desire to seek remedy by somehow controlling or legislating
technology is a big step in the wrong direction. As Berman says, "If we can't
compress data and move it quickly through an ISDN or digital pipeline, to
improve the infrastructure of the U.S., because the Bureau's having trouble
wiretapping, then the whole future of our information age is at stake." <p>

To put the issue in perspective, you must first look at the present state
of affairs. William Sessions, director of the FBI, has stated publicly that so
far the Bureau has not yet had any difficulty executing a warrant because of
digital communications.  In addition, says Marc Rotenberg, director of the
Washington office of Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility, we must
question why such far-reaching legislation is required for a law enforcement
procedure of last resort. <p>

Top of the charts. "I think the F.B.I. is sort of off the charts on this,"
says Rotenberg. "I know everyone else is talking about this as though they
believe we're going to have some reasonable discussion at some point, but where
they basically have come down on this issue is that the technology of the
digital network doesn't go forward until they can be assured that they can
continue to conduct wire surveillance." <p>

He says the proposal is contrary to the spirit of the wiretap law of 1968,
which is termed an investigative method of last resort. "It is the most
intrusive, most unbounded, most prone to abuse form of routine investigation,"
says Rotenberg. "For the F.B.I. to come back now and say that this is the
primary concern is just not tenable - it stands the law on its head." <p>

In addition, he says, the proposal is simply impractical. The Bureau cannot
reasonably expect to require every high tech firm in the United States to
ensure that its system complies with the FBI's needs and requirements of the
moment.  And the secrecy of the standards-setting hearings, he says, is a sure
way to bring technological innovation to a crawl. "Private computer firms and
researchers are already coming forward saying the best way to slow innovation
is to put up walls in the research community and start restricting information
on security practices." <p>

An impressive list of naysayers <p>

Factions from all corners of industry are rallying to fights the proposed
 legislation. <p>

The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), an industry watchdog for
networking issues, is helping organize vendors to oppose the bill. EFF
co-founder Mitch Kapor (also founder of Lotus Development) says there's an
"enormous coalition growing" in opposition to the legislation.  In fact, the
PAGE 66
                         Digital Media, April 20, 1992 <p>

EFF pulled together a coalition of concerned vendors and industry organizations
who signed a letter to Sen. Hollings on April 9, expressing deep concern over
the proposal. <p>

Signers included AT&amp;T, Cellular Telecommunications Industry Assoc.,
Computer &amp; Business Equipment Manufacturers Assoc., Computer &amp; Communications
Industry Assoc., Digital Equipment Corp., the Electronic Mail Assoc., GTE
Corp., IBM, the Information Industry Assoc., Lotus Development Corp., McCaw
Cellular Communications Inc., Microsoft Corp., NYNEX, Pacific Telesis Group,
Software Publishers Asso., Southwestern Bell, Telecommunications Industry
Assoc. and U.S.  West Inc. <p>

A spokeswoman for the influential Computer Systems Policy Project (CSPP),
an organization comprised of CEOs of the 12 computer manufacturers, says the
proposal has not yet been brought to the group as an issue, <p>

Tracking the issues <p>

The future of digital technologies depends on how we respond to the
increasing number of challenges from government and law enforcement agencies on
these critical issues. <p>

There are two industry organizations watchdogging these issues from a civil
liberties perspective that also have access to technical expertise through
their illustrious membership rosters. <p>

The Electronic Frontier Foundation has generously offered to send a copy of
the "Digital Telephony" to any interested party. <p>

Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility is based in Palo Alto, CA,
and its Washington, DC office tracks policy issues. <p>

Write your legislators. Most importantly, though, after getting up to speed
on the facts, is to contact your representatives in Congress. You can also call
Sen. Hollings, who is sponsoring the bill. The phone number is (202) 224-9340. <p>

Since the proposal has been drafted as an amendment rather than a separate
bill, people are worried that it might get slipped into a bill that has already
passed one house and be sent quietly to conference. That would be very bad. The
only way to make sure it doesn't happen is to let elected representatives know
it's not okay to shove this kind of proposal through without spirited debate,
discussions and public hearings. <p>

A tremendous blossoming <p>

A newly published report from Insight Research Corp. in Livingston, NJ -
called Multimedia Computing &amp; the Network: Applications and Telecommunications
1992-1997 - finds that in five years, 77 percent of all desktop, educational
and industrial PCs or workstations will have some communications capabilities.
"The network," says the executive summary," will function as a catalyst; it
will stimulate multimedia usage among users - and thereby increase
communications traffic." <p>

Interest and investment in digital communication is in the midst of a
tremendous blossoming, but it could be snuffed by the kind of restrictive PAGE
67
                         Digital Media, April 20, 1992 <p>

legislation proposed by the FBI. Here are just a few relevant news items from
the past month or so: * IBM Corp., Northern Telecom and Pacific Bell announced <p>

an alliance to research and field-test telecommunications <p>

network applications to speed up <p>

the creation of "Information Age services" such as <p>

teleconferencing and telecommuting. The idea is <p>

long-term evolution of the network, coupled with <p>

near-term creation of applications. * A new clearinghouse for miniaturized
computer <p>

technologies was formed by SRI International in <p>

Menlo Park, CA, called the Pocket Intelligence Forum. <p>

The program monitors and provides information <p>

on the technologies, applications and markets <p>

of so-called "pocket intelligence products" such as <p>

notebook, hand-held, palmtop and pen-top computers, <p>

and "related emerging devices." The forum <p>

will also monitor peripherals and software that <p>

support the emerging market, such as wireless <p>

communication and smart cards. * A recent study by the Information
Industries <p>

Group of Booz, Allen, &amp; Hamilton estimated that <p>

the number of cellular data subscribers in the U.S. <p>

will reach 13 million by the year 2000. * Japan's Ministries of Finance and
Posts &amp; Telecommunication <p>

are starting a major project to develop <p>

next-generation telecommunications equipment, <p>

and intend to fund major Japanese electronics firms <p>

with $ 1.2 billion to do so. * Dow Jones &amp; Co. and Nynex Corp. have agreed
to <p>

develop and jointly test a prototype service which PAGE 68
                         Digital Media, April 20, 1992 <p>

would allow Dow Jones to transmit video programming <p>

and information over the Nynex phone <p>

network. * Motorola Inc. announced that it would open the <p>

protocols used in its ARDIS nationwide radio data <p>

network, to spur the adoption of wireless data communication <p>

by mobile workers and allow third-party <p>

vendors to manufacture ARDIS-compatible <p>

terminals and/or modem devices. (ARDIS is a <p>

partnership between IBM and Motorola and the <p>

largest wireless data network in the country, covering <p>

80 percent of the population and more than 90 <p>

percent of the business activity in the U.S.) * ARDIS itself announced a
new service, in conjunction <p>

with a firm called Business Partner Solutions, <p>

that will allow application software vendors to integrate <p>

wireless data technology into their existing <p>

products easily and cheaply. * Motorola also opened several key
over-the-air protocols <p>

for use on shared systems as a catalyst to <p>

market growth. The protocols are available through <p>

a royalty-free license to manufacturers who wish to <p>

provide radio modems. The protocols are already <p>

selected as a standard by ARDIS (no surprise <p>

there), Bell-ARDIS is Canada, Deutsche Bundespost <p>

in Germany and Hutchison Mobile Data Ltd. <p>

in the U.K. <p>

The F.B.I. proposal <p>

The following is taken directly from a Federal Bureau of Investigation
document distributed to legislators and other concerned parties in Washington,
DC.  PAGE 69
                         Digital Media, April 20, 1992 <p>

Digital Telephony: <p>

Summary of Issues <p>

* The F.B.I. utilizes electronic surveillance (wire taps) <p>

in virtually every area of its investigative responsibilities. * The
telecommunications industry, which remained <p>

virtually unchanged for approximately 50 years, is <p>

now rapidly changing to address the need for more <p>

advanced telecommunications systems, such as <p>

personal communications networks, advanced cellular <p>

and integrated services digital networks <p>

(ISDN) which have the capacity for high-speed <p>

transmissions of video, voice and data. * One of the telephone
telecommunications industry's <p>

major developmental efforts is to provide total <p>

digital connectivity (end to end) for its subscribers, <p>

including residential and business communities, in <p>

the near future. * At present, no capability exists to intercept ISDN <p>

(digital) transmissions; therefore, the emergence of <p>

digital telecommunications technology will preclude <p>

the F.B.I. and all of law enforcement from <p>

being able to intercept electronic communications, <p>

thus all but eliminating a statutorily-sanctioned, <p>

court-authorized and extraordinarily successful investigate <p>

technique. * The Department of Justice and the F.B.I. have been <p>

working with the White House, various Administration <p>

agencies, the telecommunications industry <p>

and Congress to find a workable solution to this <p>

very serious problem that endangers the safety of <p>

PAGE 70
                         Digital Media, April 20, 1992 <p>

the American public. A legislative solution has been <p>

developed to ensure that the legitimate need for <p>

law enforcement to lawfully intercept communications <p>

is met by the telecommunications industry. <p>

Legislative Remedy <p>

The proposal would amend the Communications Act of 1934 to require
providers of electronic communications services and private branch exchanges to
ensure that the Government's ability to lawfully intercept communications is
unimpeded by the introduction of advanced digital telecommunications technology
or any other emerging telecommunications technology.  Specifically, the
amendment provides the following: 1. The FCC, in consultation with the Attorney
General, <p>

shall determine the technological interception <p>

needs of the Government and issue regulations that <p>

will preserve the Government's ability to conduct <p>

lawful electronic surveillance. 2. The FCC shall issue regulations within
120 days <p>

after enactment requiring the modification of existing <p>

telecommunication systems if those systems <p>

impede the Government's ability to conduct lawful <p>

electronic surveillance. 3. Compliance by service providers and private <p>

branch exchanges will be required within 180 days <p>

of the issuance of the regulations and the use of <p>

non-conforming equipment is prohibited thereafter. 4. The FCC has the
authority to compensate (through <p>

rate structure) telecommunication system operators <p>

under FCC jurisdiction for reasonable costs associated <p>

with required modifications of existing telecommunications <p>

equipment or technology. 5. The Attorney General has specific authority, in
addition <p>

to that already vested in the FCC, to seek <p>

civil penalties and injunctive relief for non-compliance.  PAGE 71

    IN TIM MAY'S EYES <p>

a digital tape is a weapon as potent and subversive as a shoulder-mounted
Stinger missile. May (fortyish, trim beard, exphysicist) holds up a $ 9.95
digital audio tape, or DAT. The cassette -- just slightly fatter than an
ordinary cassette -- contains a copy of a Mozart composition equivalent in
fidelity to a conventional digital compact disc. DAT can hold text as easily as
music. If the data is smartly compressed, one DAT purchased at K-Mart can hold
about 10,000 books in digital form. <p>

One DAT can also completely cloak a smaller library of information
interleaved within the music. Not only can the data of about 600 books (80
megabytes) be securely encrypted within a digital tape, but the library's
existence on the tape would be invisible even to powerful computers. In the
scheme May (and others) promote, a computer hard disk's worth of coded
information could be made to disappear inside an ordinary digital tape of
Michael Jackson's "Thriller." <p>

The vanishing act works as follows. DAT records music in sixteen binary
digits, but that precision is beyond perception. The difference contained in
the sixteenth bit of the signal is too small to be detectable by the human ear.
A long message -- a book of diagrams, a pile of data spreadsheets -- can be
submitted (in encrypted form) in the positions of all the sixteenth bits of
music. Anyone playing the tape would hear Michael Jackson crooning in the exact
digital quality they would hear on a purchased "Thriller" tape. Anyone
examining the tape with a computer would see only digital music. Only by
matching an untampered-with tape with the encrypted one bit by bit on a
computer could someone detect the difference. Even then, the random-looking
differences would appear to be noise acquired while duping a digital tape
through an analog CD player (as is normally done).  Finally, this "noise" would
have to be decrypted (not likely) to prove that it was something other than
noise. <p>

"What this means," says May, "is that already it is totally hopeless to
stop the flow of bits across borders. Because anyone carrying a single music
cassette bought in a store could carry the entire computerized files of the
Stealth bomber, and it would be completely and totally imperceptible." One tape
contains disco music. The other tape contains disco and the essential
blueprints of a key technology.  PAGE 18
                       Whole Earth Review, June 22, 1993 <p>

Music isn't the only way to hide things, either. "I've done this with
photos," says May. "I take a digitized photo posted on the net, download it
into Adobe Photoshop, and then strip an encrypted message into the least
significant bit in each pixel.  When I repost the image, it is essentially
indistinguishable from the original." <p>

The other thing May is into is wholly anonymous transactions. If one takes
the encryption methods developed by military agencies and transplants them into
the vast terrain of electronic networks, very powerful -- and very unbreakable
-- technologies of anonymous dealing become possible. Two complete strangers
could solicit or supply information to each other, and consummate the exchange
with money, without the least chance of being traced. That's something that
cannot securely be done with phones and the post office now. <p>

It's not just spies and organized crime who are paying attention to this
technology. Efficient means of authentication and verification, such as smart
cards, tamperproof networks, and micro-size encryption chips, are driving the
cost of ciphers down to the consumer level. <p>

Encryption is now affordable for everyman. <p>

The upshot of all this, Tim believes, is the end of corporations in their
current form and the beginning of more sophisticated untaxed black markets. Tim
calls this movement Crypto-Anarchy. "I have to tell you I think there is a
coming war between two forces," Tim May confides to me. "One force wants full
disclosure, an end to secret dealings. That's the government going after pot
smokers and controversial bulletin boards. The other force wants privacy and
civil liberties. In this war, encryption wins. Unless the government is
successful in banning encryption, which it won't be, encryption always wins." <p>

A couple of years ago, May wrote a manifesto to alert the world to the
advent of widespread encryption.  In this electronic broadside, published on
the net, he warned of the coming "specter of crypto anarchy.": <p>

The State will of course try to slow or halt the spread of this technology,
citing national security concerns, use of the technology by drug dealers and
tax evaders, and fears of societal disintegration. Many of these concerns will
be valid; crypto anarchy will allow national secrets to be traded freely and
will allow illicit and stolen materials to be traded. An anonymous computerized
market will even make possible abhorrent markets for assassinations and
extortion. Various criminal and foreign elements will be active users of
CryptoNet. But this will not halt the spread of crypto anarchy. <p>

Just as the technology of printing altered and reduced the power of
medieval guilds and the social power structure, so too will cryptologic methods
fundamentally alter the nature of corporations and of government interference
in economic transactions.  Combined with emerging information markets, crypto
anarchy will create a liquid market for any and all material which can be put
into words and pictures. And just as a seemingly minor invention like barbed
wire made possible the fencing-off of vast ranches and farms, thus altering
forever the concepts of land and property rights in the frontier West, so too
will the seemingly minor discovery out of an arcane branch of mathematics come
to be the wire clippers which dismantle the barbed wire around intellectual
property.  PAGE 19
                       Whole Earth Review, June 22, 1993 <p>

The manifesto was signed: <p>

Timothy C. May, Crypto Anarchy: encryption, digital money, anonymous
networks, digital pseudonyms, zero knowledge, reputations, information markets,
black markets, collapse of government. <p>

I asked May, a retired Intel physicist, to explain the connection between
 encryption and the collapse of society as we know it. May explained: "Medieval
guilds would monopolize information. When someone tried to make leather or
silver outside the guilds, the King's men came in and pounded on them because
the guild paid a levy to the King. What broke the medieval guilds was printing;
someone could publish a treatise on how to tan leather. In the age of printing,
corporations arose to monopolize certain expertise, like gunsmithing or making
steel. Now encryption will cause the erosion of the current corporate monopoly
on expertise and proprietary knowledge. Corporations won't be able to keep
secrets because of how easy it will be to sell information on the nets." <p>

The reason crypto-anarchy hasn't broken out yet, according to May, is that
the military has a monopoly on the key knowledge of encryption -- just as the
Church once tried to control printing. With few exceptions, encryption
technology has been invented by and for the world's military organizations. To
say that the military is secretive about this technology would be an
understatement. Very little developed by the US National Security Agency (NSA)
-- whose mandate it is to develop crypto-systems -- has ever trickled down for
civilian use, unlike technologies spun off from the rest of the
military/industrial alliance. <p>

But who needs encryption, anyway? Only people with something to hide,
perhaps. Spies, criminals, and malcontents. People whose appetite for
 encryption may be thwarted righteously, effectively, and harshly. <p>

The ground shifted two decades ago, when the information age arrived and
intelligence became the chief asset of corporations. Intelligence was no longer
the monopoly of the Central Intelligence Agency, but the subject of seminars
for CEOs.  Spying meant corporate spying. Illicit transfer of corporate
knowhow, rather than military plans, became the treasonous information the
state had to worry about. <p>

In addition, within the last decade, computers became fast and cheap;
enciphering no longer demanded supercomputers and the super-budgets needed to
run them. A generic-brand PC picked up at a garage sale could handle the
massive computations a public-key encryption scheme required. For small
companies running their entire business on PCs, encryption was a tool they
wanted on their hard disks. <p>

And now, within the last few years, a thousand electronic networks have
blossomed into one highly decentralized network of networks. A network is a
distributed thing; if one part breaks, the workload is routed around that
failing, and the whole net keeps flying. There are few centers of control, and
few clear boundaries. How do you secure something that doesn't even know how
big it is? Certain types of encryption, it turns out, are an ideal way to bring
security to a decentralized system while keeping the system flexible. Rather
than trying to seal out trouble with a rigid wall of security, networks can
tolerate all kinds of crap if a large portion of their members use peer-to-peer
 encryption.  Suddenly, encryption has become incredibly useful to ordinary <p>

PAGE 20
                       Whole Earth Review, June 22, 1993 <p>

people who have "nothing to hide" but their privacy. Peer-to-peer encryption,
sown into the net, linked with electronic payments, tied into everyday business
deals, becomes just another business tool, like fax machines or credit cards. <p>

dollars funded the military ownership of this technology -- want the
technology back. <p>

But the government (at least the US government) may not give encryption
back to the people for a number of antiquated reasons. So, for the past year or
so, a loose federation of creative math hackers, civil libertarians,
free-market advocates, genius programmers, renegade cryptologists, and sundry
other frontier folk, has been creating, assembling, or appropriating encryption
technology to plug into the net. Some of them call themselves cypherpunks. <p>

On a couple of Saturdays, I join Tim May and about fifteen other
crypto-rebels for their monthly cypherpunk meeting, held near Palo Alto, CA.
The group meets in a typically non-descript office complex full of small
hi-tech startup companies. It could be anywhere in Silicon Valley. The room has
corporate-gray carpeting and a conference table. The moderator for this
meeting, Eric Hughes, tries to quite the cacophony of loud, opinionated voices.
Hughes, with sandy hair halfway down his back, grabs a marker and scribbles the
agenda on a whiteboard. The items he writes down echo Tim May's digital card:
reputations, PGP encryption, anonymous remailer update, and the Diffey-Hellmann
key exchange paper. <p>

After a bit of gossip the group gets down to business. It's class time. One
member, Dean Tribble, stands up front to report on his research on digital
reputations. If you are trying to do business with people you know only as
names introducing some email, how can you be sure they are legit? Tribble
suggests that you can buy a reputation from a "trust escrow" -- a company
similar to a title or bond company that would guarantee someone for a fee. He
explains the lesson from game theory concerning iterated negotiation games,
like the Prisoner's Dilemma; how payoffs shift when playing the game over and
over instead of just once, and how important reputations become in iterated
relationships. The potential problems of buying and selling reputations online
are chewed on, and suggestions of new directions for research are made, before
Tribble sits down and another member stands to give a brief talk. Around the
table it goes. <p>

Arthur Abraham, dressed in heavy, studded black leather, reviews a recent
technical paper on encryption.  Abraham flicks an overhead projector on, whips
out some transparencies painted with equations, and walks the group through the
mathematical proof.  It is clear that the math is not easy for most. Sitting
around the table are programmers (many self-taught), engineers, consultants --
all very smart -- but only a single member is equipped with a background in
mathematics. "What do you mean by that?" questions one quiet fellow as Abraham
talks. "Oh, I see, you forgot the modulus," chimes in another guy. "Is that a
to the x or a to the y?" The amateur crypto-hackers challenge each statement,
asking for clarification, mulling it over until each understands. The hacker
mind, the programmer's drive to whittle things down to an elegant minimum, to
seek shortcuts, confronts the academic stance of the paper. Pointing to a large
hunk of one equation, Dean Tribble asks, "Why not just scrap all this?" A voice
from the back: "That's a great question, and I think I know why not." So the
voice explains. Dean nods. Arthur looks around to be sure everyone got it. Then
he goes on to the next line in the paper; those who understand help out those
PAGE 21
                       Whole Earth Review, June 22, 1993 <p>

who don't. Soon the room is full of people saying, Oh, that means you can serve
this up on a network configuration! Hey, cool!  And another tool for
distributed computing is born; another component is transferred from shroud of
military secrecy to the open web of the net; another brick is set into the
foundation of public encryption. <p>

The main thrust of the group's efforts takes place in the virtual online
space of the Cypherpunk electronic mailing list. A growing crowd of crypto-hip
folks from around the world interact daily via an Internet "mailing list." Here
they pass around code-in-progress as they attempt to implement ideas on the
cheap (such as digital signatures), or discuss the ethical and political
implications of what they are doing. An anonymous subset of them has launched
the Information Liberation Front. <p>

The ILE locates scholarly papers on cryptology appearing in very expensive
(and very hard-to-find) journals, scans them in by computer, and "liberates"
them from their copyright restrictions by posting the articles anonymously to
the net. <p>

Posting anything anonymously to the net is quite hard: the nature of the
net is to track everything infallibly, and to duplicate items promiscuously. It
is theoretically trivial to monitor transmission nodes in order to backtrack a
message to its source. In such a climate of potential omniscience, the
crypto-rebels yearn for true anonymity. <p>

I confess my misgivings about the potential market for anonymity to Tim:
"Seems like the perfect thing for ransom notes, extortion threats, bribes,
blackmail, insider trading and terrorism." "Well," Tim answers, "what about
selling information that isn't viewed as legal, say about pot-growing,
do-it-yourself abortion, cryonics, or even peddling alternative medical
information without a license? What about the anonymity wanted for
whistleblowers, confessionals, and dating personals?" <p>

Digital anonymity is needed, the crypto-rebels feel, because anonymity is
as important a civil tool as authentic identification is. Pretty good anonymity
is offered by the post office; you don't need to give a return address, and the
post office doesn't verify it if you do. Telephones (without caller ID) and
telegrams are likewise anonymous (to a rough degree). And everyone has a right
(upheld by the Supreme Court) to distribute anonymous handbills and pamphlets.
Anonymity stirs the most fervor among those who spend hours each day in
networked communications. Ted Kaehler, a programmer at Apple Computer, believes
that "our society is in the midst of a privacy crisis." He sees encryption as
an extension of such all-American institutions as the post office. "We have
always valued the privacy of the mails. Now, for the first time, we don't have
to trust in it; we can enforce it." John Gilmore, a crypto-freak who sits on
the board of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, says, "We clearly have a
societal need for anonymity in our basic communications media." <p>

A pretty good society needs more than just anonymity. An online
civilization requires online anonymity, online identification, online
authentication, online reputations, online trustholders, online signatures,
online privacy, and online access. All are essential ingredients of any open
society. The cypherpunks' agenda is to build the tools that provide digital
equivalents to the interpersonal conventions we have in face-to-face society,
and hand them out for free. By the time they are done, the cypherpunks hope to
have given away free PAGE 22
                       Whole Earth Review, June 22, 1993 <p>

digital signatures, as well as the opportunity for online anonymity.(1) <p>

To create digital anonymity, the cypherpunks have developed about fifteen
prototype versions of an anonymous remailer that would, when fully implemented,
make it impossible to determine the source of an possible to determine the
source of an email message, even under intensive monitoring of communication
lines. One stage of the remailer works today. When you use it to mail Alice,
she gets a message from you that says it is from "nobody." Unraveling where it
came from is trivial for any computer capable of monitoring the entire network
-- a feat few can afford. But to be mathematically untraceable, the remailers
have to work in a relay of at least two (more is better) -- one remailer
handing off a message to the next remailer, diluting information about its
source to nothing as it is passed along. <p>

Eric Hughes sees a role for digital pseudonymity -- your identity is known
by some but not by others. When cloaked pseudonymously, "You could join a
collective to purchase some information and decrease your actual cost by orders
of magnitude -- that is, until it is almost free." A digital co-op could form a
private online library and collectively purchase digital movies, albums,
software, and expensive newsletters, which they would "lend" to each other over
the net. The vendor selling the information would have absolutely no way of
determining whether he was selling to one person or five hundred. Hughes sees
these kinds of arrangements peppered into an information-rich society as
"increasing the margins where the poor can survive." <p>

"One thing for sure," Tim says, "long term, this stuff nukes tax
collection." I venture the rather lame observation that this may be one reason
the government isn't handing the technology back. I also offer the speculation
that an escalating arms race with a digital IRS might evolve. For every new
avenue the digital underground invents to disguise transactions, the digital
IRS will counter with a surveillance method. Tim pooh-poohs the notion.
"Without a doubt, this stuff is unbreakable.  Encryption always wins." <p>

The Fax Effect <p>

Encryption always wins because it follows the logic of the net. A given
public-key encryption key can eventually be cracked by a supercomputer working
on the problem long enough. Those who have codes they don't want cracked try to
stay ahead of the supercomputers by increasing the length of their keys (the
longer a key is the harder it is to crack) -- but at the cost of making the
safeguard more unwieldy and slow to use. However, any code can be deciphered,
given enough time or money. As Eric Hughes often reminds fellow cypherpunks, "
Encryption is economics.  Encryption is always possible, just expensive." It
took A.  Shamir a year to break a 120-digit key using a network of distributed
Sun workstations working part-time. A person could use a key so long that no
supercomputer could crack it for the foreseeable future, but it would be
awkward to use in daily life. A buildingful of NSA's specially hotrodded
supercomputers might take a day to crack a 140-digit code today. But that is a
full day's commitment of big iron to open just one lousy key! <p>

Cypherpunks intend to level the playing field against centralized computer
resources with the Fax Effect. If you have the only fax machine in the world,
it is worth nothing. But with every other fax installed in the world, your fax
machine increases in value. In fact, the more faxes in the world, the more
valuable everybody's fax becomes. This is the logic of the net, also known as
PAGE 23
                       Whole Earth Review, June 22, 1993 <p>

the law of increasing returns. It goes contrary to classical economic theories
of wealth based on equilibratory tradeoff. These state that you can't get
something from nothing; the truth is, you can. (Only now are a few radical
professors formalizing this notion.) Hackers, cypherpunks, and many hi-tech
entrepreneurs already know that in network economics, more brings more. This is
why giving things away so often works, and why the cypherpunks want to pass out
their tools gratis. It has less to do with charity than with the clear
intuition that network economics reward the more and not the less -- and you
can seed the "more" at the start by giving the tools away. (The cypherpunks
also talk about using the economics of the net for the reverse side of
encryption: to crack codes. They could assemble a people's supercomputer by
networking together a million Macintoshes, each one computing a coordinated
little part of a huge, distributed decryption program. In theory such a
decentralized parallel computer would, in sum, be the most powerful computer we
can now imagine -- far greater than the centralized NSA's.) <p>

Encryption taps the Fax Effect. If you are the only person using
 encryption, you are a lightning rod for an attempted cracking. But your keys
become more valuable as more people use encryption, because this lessens the
possibility of your key being cracked. Just as with fax, the more people using
 encryption, the more valuable it becomes for all. The world's most powerful
supercomputer grinds all day to crack one key. What is it going to do when 100
million people each use 100 different keys per day? <p>

The idea of choking Big Brother with a deluge of petty, heavily encrypted
messages so tickles the imagination of crypto-rebels that one of them came up
with a freeware version of a highly regarded public-key encryption scheme. The
software is called PGP, for Pretty Good Privacy. The code has been passed out
on the nets for free and made available on disk. In certain parts of the net it
is quite common to see messages encrypted with PGP, with a note that the
sender's public key is "available upon request." <p>

PGP is not the only encryption freeware. On the nets, cypherpunks can grab
RIPEM, a software application for privacy-enhanced mail. Both PGP and RIPEM are
based on RSA, a patented implementation of encryption algorithms. But while
RIPEM is distributed as public-domain software by RSA (the company), Pretty
Good Privacy software is homebrew code concocted by a crypto-rebel named Philip
Zimmermann. Because Pretty Good Privacy uses RSA's patented math, it's
outlaw-ware. <p>

RSA was developed at MIT -- partly with federal funds -- but was later
licensed to the academic researchers who invented it.  The researchers
published their crypto-methods before they filed for patents, out of fear that
the NSA would hold up the patents or even prevent the civilian use of their
system. In the US, inventors have a year after publication to file patents. But
the rest of the world requires patents before publication, so RSA could secure
only US patents on its system. PGP's use of RSA's patented mathematics is
legitimate overseas. But PGP is commonly exchanged in the no-place of the net
(what country's jurisdiction prevails in cyberspace?), where the law on
intellectual property is still a bit murky, and close to the beginnings of
cryptoanarchy.  Pretty Good Privacy deals with this legal tarbaby by notifying
its American users that it is their responsibility to secure from RSA a license
for use of PGP's underlying algorithm. (Sure. Right.)  PAGE 24
                       Whole Earth Review, June 22, 1993 <p>

Zimmermann claims he released the quasilegal PGP into the world because he
was concerned that the government would reclaim all public-key encryption
technology, including RSA's. RSA can't stop distribution of existing versions
of PGP because once something goes onto the net, it never comes back. But it's
hard for RSA to argue damages: both the outlaw PGP and the officially
sanctioned RIPEM infect the net to produce the Fax Effect. PGP encourages
consumer use of
 encryption -- the more use, the better for everyone in the business. Pretty
Good Privacy is freeware; like most freeware, its users will sooner or later
graduate to commercially supported stuff. Only RSA offers the license for that
at the moment.  Economically, what could be better for a patentholder than to
have a million people use the buddy system to teach themselves about the
intricacies and virtues of your product (as pirated and distributed by others),
and then wait in line to buy your stuff when they want the best? <p>

The Fax Effect, the rule of freeware upgrade, and the power of distributed
intelligence are all part of an emerging network economics. Tim May even sees
the rise of encryption and the downfall of corporations as part of this new
economics. ("Big monolithic corporations will become virtual corporations," he
says, "a temporary ensemble of skilled people. They'll nucleate for six months
to make a product, say a Hollywood film, and then the virtual corporation will
dissipate and vanish.")  Corporations will become shifting network ghosts in a
networked world. <p>

Politics in a network economy will definitely require the kind of tools the
cypherpunks are playing with. Glenn Tenney, chairman of the annual Hackers'
Conference, ran for public office in California last year using the computer
networks for campaigning, and came away with a realistic grasp of how they will
shape politics. He notes that digital techniques for establishing trust are
needed for electronic democracy. He writes online, "Imagine if a Senator
responds to some email, but someone alters the response and then sends it on to
the NY Times? Authentication, digital signatures, etc. are essential for
protection of all sides."  Encryption and digital signatures are techniques to
expand the dynamics of trust into a new territory.  Encryption cultivates a
"web of trust" says Phil Zimmermann, the very web that is the heart of any
society or human network. The short form of the cypherpunk's obsession with
 encryption can be summarized as: Pretty good privacy means pretty good
society. <p>

One of the consequences of network economics, as facilitated by ciphers and
digital technology, is the transformation of what we mean by pretty good
privacy. Networks shift privacy from the realm of morals to the marketplace;
privacy becomes a commodity. <p>

A telephone directory has value because of the energy it saves a caller in
finding a particular phone number. When telephones were new, having an
individual number to list in a directory was valuable to the lister and to all
other telephone users (the Fax Effect). But today, in a world full of easily
obtained telephone numbers, an unlisted phone number is more valuable to the
unlisted (who pay more) and to the phone company (which charges more). Privacy
is a commodity to be priced and sold. <p>

Most privacy transactions will soon take place in the marketplace, rather
than in government offices, because a centralized government is handicapped in
a distributed, open-weave network, and can no longer guarantee how things are
connected or not connected. Hundreds of privacy vendors will sell bits of <p>

PAGE 25
                       Whole Earth Review, June 22, 1993 <p>

privacy at market rates. You hire Little Brother, Inc. to demand maximum
payment from junk-mail and direct marketers when you sell your name, and to
monitor uses of that information as it tends to escape into the net. On your
behalf, Little Brother, Inc.  negotiates with other privacy vendors for hired
services such as personal encrypters, absolutely unlisted numbers, bozo
filters, stranger-ID screeners (such as caller ID on phones that only accept
calls from certain numbers), and for hired mechanical agents (called network
"knowbots") to trace addresses, and for counter-knowbots that unravel traces of
your own activities. <p>

Privacy is a type of information that has its polarity reversed; I imagine
it as anti-information. The removal of a bit of information from a system can
be seen as the reproduction of a corresponding bit of anti-information. In a
world flooded with information ceaselessly replicating itself to the edges of
the net, the absence or vaporization of a bit of information becomes very
valuable, especially if that absence can be maintained. In a world where
everything is connected to everything -- where connection and information and
knowledge are dirt cheap -- then disconnection and anti-information and
no-knowledge become expensive. When bandwidth becomes free and entire gigabytes
of information are swapped around the clock, what you don't want to communicate
becomes the most difficult chore.  Encryption systems and their ilk are
technologies of disconnection. They attempt to tame the network's innate
tendency to connect and inform without discrimination. <p>

The Next Utility Meter <p>

We manage the disconnection of other domestic utilities, such as water or
electricity, through metering. But metering is neither obvious nor easy. Thomas
Edison's dazzling electrical gizmos were of little use to anyone until people
had easy access to electricity in their factories and homes. So, at the peak of
his career, Edison diverted his attention away from designing electrical
delivery network itself. At first, very little was settled about how
electricity should be created (DC or AC?), carried, or billed. For billing,
Edison favored the approach that most information-providers today favor: charge
a flat fee.  Readers pay the same for a newspaper no matter how much of it they
read. Ditto for cable TV, books and computer software. All are priced flat for
all you can use. <p>

Edison pushed a flat fee for electricity -- a fixed amount if you are
connected, nothing if you aren't -- because he felt that the costs of
accounting for differential usage would exceed the cost of the variances in
electricity usage. But mostly Edison was stymied about how to meter
electricity. For the first six months of his General Electric Lighting Company
in New York City, customers paid a flat fee. To Edison's chagrin, that didn't
work out economically. Edison was forced to come up with a stopgap solution.
His remedy, an electrolytic meter, was erratic and impractical. It froze in
winter, sometimes it ran backwards, and customers couldn't read it (nor did
they trust the meter readers). It wasn't until a decade after municipal
electrical networks were up and running that another inventor came up with a
reliable watt-hour meter. Now we can hardly imagine buying electricity any
other way. <p>

A hundred years later, the information industry still lacks an information
meter. George Gilder, hi-tech gadfly, puts the problem this way: "Rather than
having to pay for the whole reservoir every time you are thirsty, what you want
is to only pay for a glass of water."  PAGE 26
                       Whole Earth Review, June 22, 1993 <p>

Indeed, why buy an ocean of information when all you want is a drink? <p>

No reason at all, if you have an information meter. Entrepreneur Peter
Sprague believes he has just invented one. "We use encryption to force the
metering of information," says Sprague. His spigot is a microchip that doles
out small bits of information from a huge pile of encrypted data. Instead of
selling a CD-ROM crammed with a hundred thousand pages of legal documents for $
2,000, Sprague invented a ciphering device that would dispense the documents
off the CD-ROM at $ 1 per page. A user only pays for what she uses, and can use
only what she pays for. <p>

Sprague's way of selling information per-page is to make each page
unreadable until it is decrypted. Working from a catalog of contents, a user
selects a range of information to browse. She reads the abstract or summaries
(and is charged a minuscule amount). Then she selects a full text, which is
decrypted by her dispenser. Each act of decryption rings up a small charge
(maybe fifty cents). The charge is tallied by a metering chip in her dispenser
that deducts the amount from a prepaid account (also stored on the metering
chip), much as a postage meter deducts credit while dispensing postage tapes.
When the CD-ROM credit runs out, she calls a central office, which replenishes
her account via an encrypted message sent on a modem line running into her
computer's metering chip. Her dispenser now has $ 300 credit to spend on
information -- by the page, by the paragraph, or by the stock price, depending
on how fine the vendor is cutting it. <p>

What Sprague's encryption -metering device does is decouple information's
fabulous ease in being copied from its owners' need to have it selectively
disconnected. It lets information flow freely and ubiquitously -- like water
through a town's plumbing -- by metering it out in usable chunks. Metering
converts information into a utility. <p>

The cypherpunks note, quite correctly, that this will not stop hackers from
siphoning off free information. The Videocipher encryption system, used to
meter satellite-delivered TV programs such as HBO and Showtime, was compromised
within weeks of its introduction. Despite claims by its manufacturer that the
encrypto-metering chip was unhackable, big moneymaking scams capitalized on
hacks around the codes. (The scams were set up on Indian reservations -- but
that's a whole 'nother story).  Pirates would find a descrambler box with a
valid subscription -- in a hotel room, for instance -- and then clone the
identity into other chips. A consumer would send the box to the reservation for
"repairs," and it would come back with a new chip cloned with the identity of
the hotel box. The broadcasting system couldn't perceive clones in the
audience.  In short, the system was hacked not by cracking the code, but by
subverting places where the code tied into the other parts of the system. <p>

No system is hack-proof. But disruptions of an encrypted system require
deliberate creative energy. Information meters can't stop thievery or hacking,
but meters can counteract the effects of lazy mooching and the natural human
desire to share. The Videocipher satellite-TV system eliminates user piracy on
a mass scale -- the type of piracy that plagued the TV outback before
scrambling, and that still plagues the lands of software and photocopying.
Encryption makes pirating a chore, and not something that any slouch with a
blank disk can do. Satellite encryption works overall because encryption always
wins.  PAGE 27

Peter Sprague's crypto-meter permits Alice to make as many copies of the
encrypted CD-ROMs as she likes, since she pays only for what she uses.
Crypto-metering, in essence, disengages the process of payment from the process
of duplication. This disconnection follows the bias of information. <p>

Using encryption to force the metering of information works, because it
does not constrain information's desire to reproduce. All things being equal, a
bit of information will replicate through an available network until it fills
that network.  With an animate drive, every fact naturally proliferates as many
times as possible. The more fit -- the more interesting or useful -- a fact is,
the wider it spreads. A pretty metaphor compares the spread of genes through a
population with the similar spread of ideas, or memes, in a population. Both
genes and memes depend on a network of replicating machines -- cells or brains
or computer terminals. A network, in this general sense, is a swarm of flexibly
interconnected nodes, each of which can copy (either exactly or with variation)
a message taken from another node. A population of butterflies and a flurry of
email messages have the same mandate: replicate or die. Information wants to be
copied. <p>

Our digital society has built a supernetwork of copiers out of hundreds of
millions of personal faxes, library photocopiers, and desktop hard disks. It is
as if our information society is one huge aggregate copy machine. But we won't
let this super machine copy. Much to everyone's surprise, information created
in one corner finds its way into all the other corners rather quickly. Because
our previous economy was built upon scarcity of goods, we have so far fought
the natural fecundity of information by trying to control every act of
replication as it occurs. We take a massively parallel copy machine and try to
stifle most
 acts of reproduction. As in other puritanical regimes, this doesn't work.
Information wants to be copied. <p>

"Free the bits!" shouts Tim May. This sense of the word "free" shifts
Stewart Brand's oft-quoted maxim, "Information wants to be free" -- as in
"without cost" -- to the more subtle "without chains or imprisonment."
Information wants to be free to wander and reproduce. Success, in a networked
world of decentralized nodes, belongs to those plans that do not resist either
the replication or roaming urges of information. <p>

Sprague's encrypted meter capitalizes on the distinction between pay and
copy. "It is easy to make software count how many times it has been invoked,
but hard to make it count how many times it has been copied," says software
architect Brad Cox. In a message broadcast on the Internet, Cox writes: <p>

Software objects differ from tangible objects in being fundamentally unable
to monitor their copying but trivially able to monitor their use....So why not
build an information age market economy around this difference between
manufacturing age and information age goods? If revenue collection were based
on monitoring the use of software inside a computer, vendors could dispense
with copy protection altogether. <p>

Cox is a software developer specializing in a new species of modular
software code called object-oriented programming (OOP).  OOP delivers two
magnificent improvements over conventional software. First, OOP provides the
user with applications that are more fluid, more interoperable with various
tasks -- sort of like a house with movable "object" furniture instead of a
house saddled with built-in furniture. Second, OOP provides software developers
the PAGE 28
                       Whole Earth Review, June 22, 1993 <p>

ability to "reuse" modules of software, whether they wrote the modules
themselves or purchased them from someone else. To build a database, an OOP
designer like Cox takes a sort routine, a field manager, a form generator, an
icon handler, etc., and assembles the program, instead of rewriting a working
whole from scratch. Cox developed a set of cool OOP objects that he sold to
Steve Jobs to use in his Next machine, but selling small bits of modular code
as a regular business has been slow. It is similar to trying to peddle
limericks one by one. To recoup the great cost of writing an individual object
by selling it outright would garner too few sales, but selling it by copy is
too hard to monitor or control. But if objects could generate revenue each time
a user activated them, then an author could make a living creating them. <p>

While contemplating the possible market for OOP objects that were sold on a
"per-use" plan, Cox uncovered the natural grain in networked intelligence: Let
the copies flow, and pay per use. He says, "The premise is that copy protection
is exactly the wrong idea for intangible, easily copied goods such as software.
You want information-age goods to be freely distributed and freely acquired via
whatever distribution means you want. You are positively encouraged to download
software from networks, give copies to your friends, or send it as junk mail to
people you've never met. Broadcast my software from satellites. Please!" <p>

Cox adds (in echo of Peter Sprague, although, surprisingly, the two are
unfamiliar with each other's work): "This generosity is possible because the
software is actually 'meterware.' It has strings attached that make revenue
collection independent of how the software was distributed." <p>

Cox calls this system "superdistribution," a name given by Japanese
researchers to a similar method they devised to track the flow of software
through a network. "The approach is called superdistribution," Cox says,
"because, like superconductivity, it lets information flow freely, without
resistance from copy protection or piracy." The model is the successful balance
of copyright and userights worked out by the music and radio industries.
Musicians earn money not only by selling customers a copy of their work, but by
selling broadcast stations a "use" of their music. The copies are supplied
free, sent to radio stations in a great flood by the musicians' agents. The
stations sort through this tide of free music, paying royalties only for the
music they broadcast, as metered (statistically) by two agencies representing
musicians, ASCAP and BMI. <p>

JEIDA, a Japanese consortium of computer manufacturers, developed a chip
and a protocol that allows each Macintosh on a network to freely replicate
software while metering userights. According to Ryoichi Mori, the head of
JEIDA, "Each computer is thought of as a station that broadcasts, not the
software itself, but the use of the software, to an audience of a single
'listener.'"  Each time your Mac "plays" a piece of software, or a software
component from among thousands freely available, it triggers a royalty.
Commercial radio and TV provide an "existence proof" of a working
superdistribution system, in which the copies are disseminated free and the
stations only pay for what they use.  Musicians would be quite happy if one
radio station made copies of their tapes and distributed them to other stations
("Free the bits!"), because it increases the likelihood of some station using
their music. <p>

JEIDA envisions software percolating through large computer networks
unencumbered by restrictions on copying or mobility.  Like Cox, Sprague, and
the cypherpunks, JEIDA counts on public-key encryption to keep these counts
PAGE 29
                       Whole Earth Review, June 22, 1993 <p>

private and untampered as they are transmitted to the credit center. Peter
Sprague says plainly, "Encrypted metering is an ASCAP for intellectual
property." <p>

Cox's electronically disseminated pamphlet on superdistribution sums up the
virtues very nicely: <p>

Whereas software's ease of replication is a liability today,
superdistribution makes it an asset. Whereas software vendors must spend
heavily to overcome software's invisibility, superdistribution thrusts software
out into the world to serve as its own advertisement. Whereas the personal
computer revolution isolates individuals inside a standalone personal computer,
superdistribution establishes a cooperative/competitive community around an
information age market economy. <p>

A hoary orge known as the Pay-Per-View Problem haunts the information
economy. In the past this monster ate billions of dollars in failed corporate
attempts to sell movies, databases, or music recordings on a per-view or
per-use basis. The ogre still lives. The problem is, people are reluctant to
pay in advance for information they haven't seen because of their hunch that
they might not find it useful. They are equally unwilling to pay after they
have seen it, because their hunch usually proves correct: they could have lived
without it.  Can you imagine being asked to pay after you've seen a movie?
Medical knowledge is the only type of information that can be easily sold sight
unseen, because the buyers believe they can't live without it. <p>

The ogre is usually slain with sampling. Moviegoers are persuaded to pay
beforehand by lapel-grabbing trailers. Software is loaned among friends for
trial; books and magazines are browsed in the bookstore. <p>

The other way to slay the problem is by lowering the price of admission.
Newspapers are cheap: we pay before looking. The ingenious thing about
information-metering is that it delivers two solutions: it provides a spigot
that records how much data is used, and it provides a spigot that can be turned
down to a cheap trickle.  Encryption metering chops big expensive data hunks
into small inexpensive doses of data. People will readily pay for bits of cheap
information before viewing, particularly if the payment invisibly deducts
itself from an account. <p>

The fine granularity of information-metering gets Peter Sprague excited.
When asked for an example of how fine it could get, he volunteers one so fast
it's obvious that he has been giving it some thought. "Say you want to write
obscene limericks from your house in Telluride, Colorado. If you could write
one obscene limerick a day, we can probably find 10,000 people in the world who
want to pay ten cents a day to get it. We'll collect $ 365,000 per year and pay
you $ 120,000, and then you can ski for the rest of your life." In no other
kind of marketplace would one measly limerick, no matter how bawdy and clever,
be worth selling on its own. Maybe a book of them -- an ocean of limericks --
but not one. Yet in an electronic marketplace, a single limerick -- the
information equivalent of a stick of gum -- is worth producing and offering for
sale. <p>

Sprague ticks off a list of other fine-grained items that might be traded
in such a marketplace. He catalogs what he'd pay for right now: "I want the
weather in Prague for twenty-five cents per month, I want my stocks updated for
50 cents a stock, I want the Dines Letter for $ 12 a week, I want the
congestion report <p>

PAGE 30
                       Whole Earth Review, June 22, 1993 <p>

from O'Hare Airport updated continuously because I'm always getting stuck in
Chicago, so I'll pay a buck per month for that, and I want 'Hagar the Horrible'
for a nickel a day." Each of these products is currently either given away
scattershot, or peddled in the aggregate very expensively. Sprague's
electronically mediated marketplace would "unbundle" the data, and deliver a
narrowly selected piece of information to your desktop or mobile palmtop for a
reasonable price.  Encryption would meter it out, preventing you from filching
other tiny bits of data that would hardly be worth protecting (or selling) in
other ways. In essence, the ocean of information flows through you, but you
only pay for what you drink. <p>

At the moment, this particular technology of disconnection exists as a $ 95
circuitboard that can slide into a personal computer and plug into a phone
line.  To encourage established computer manufacturers such as Hewlett-Packard
and Kalieda to hardwire a similar board into units coming off their assembly
line, Sprague's company, Waves, Inc., offers manufacturers a percentage of the
revenue the encryption system generates. Their first market is lawyers,
"because lawyers spend $ 400 a month on information searches." Sprague's next
step is to compress the encrypto-metering circuits and the modem down into a
single $ 20 microchip that can be tucked into beepers, video recorders, phones,
radios, and anything else that dispenses information.  Ordinarily, this vision
might be dismissed as the pipe dream of a starry-eyed junior inventor, but
Peter Sprague is chairman and founder of National Semiconductor. He is sort of
a Henry Ford of silicon chips. A cypherpunk: not. If anyone knows how to
squeeze a revolutionary economy onto the head of a pin, it might be him. <p>

Digital Cash <p>

This anticipated information economy still lacks one vital component -- an
ingredient that, once again, is enabled by encryption, and a key element that,
once again, only long-haired crypto-rebels are experimenting with: electronic
cash. <p>

We already have electronic money. It flows daily in great invisible rivers
from bank vault to bank vault, from broker to broker, from country to country,
from your employer to your bank account. One institution alone, the Clearing
House Interbank Payment System, currently moves an average of one trillion
dollars (a million millions) each day via wire and satellite. <p>

But that river of numbers is institutional electronic money, as remote from
electronic cash as mainframes are from PCs. When pocket cash goes digital --
de-massified into data in the same transformation that institutional money
underwent -- we'll experience the deepest consequences of an information
economy. Just as computing machines did not reorganize society until
individuals plugged into them outside of institutions, the full effects of
electronic economy will have to wait until everyday pettycash (and check)
transactions of individuals go digital. <p>

We have a hint of digital cash in credit card and ATMs. Like most of my
generation, I get the little cash I use at an ATM, not having been inside a
bank in years. On average, I use less cash every month. Highoctane executives
fly around the country purchasing everything on the go -- meals, rooms, cabs,
supplies, presents -- carrying no more than $ 50 in their wallets.  Already,
the cashless society is real for some.  PAGE 31
                       Whole Earth Review, June 22, 1993 <p>

Today in the US, credit-card purchases are used for one-tenth of all
consumer payments. Credit-card companies salivate, envisioning a near future
where people routinely use their cards for "virtually every kind of
transaction." Visa U.S.A. is experimenting with card-based electronic money
terminals (no slip to sign) at fast-food shops and grocery stores. Since 1975,
Visa has issued over 20 million debit cards that deduct money from one's bank
account. In essence, Visa moved ATMs off of bank walls and onto the front
counters of stores. <p>

The conventional view of cashless money thus touted by banks and most
futurists is not much more than a pervasive extension of the generic
credit-card system now operating. Alice has an account at National Trust Me
Bank. The bank issues her one of their handy-dandy smart cards. She goes to an
ATM and loads the wallet-size debit card with $ 300 cash, deducted from her
checking account.  She can spend her $ 300 from the card at any store, gas
station, ticket counter, or phone booth that has a Trust Me smart-card slot. <p>

What's wrong with this picture? Most folks would prefer this system over
passing around portraits of dead presidents. Or over indebtedness to Visa or
MasterCard. But this version of the cashless concept slights both user and
merchant; therefore it has slept on the drawing boards for years, and will
probably die there. <p>

Foremost among the debit (or credit) card's weaknesses is its nasty habit
of leaving every merchant Alice buys from -- newsstand to nursery -- with a
personalized history of her purchases. The record of a single store is not
worrisome. But each store's file of Alice's spending is indexed with her bank
account number or Social Security number. That makes it all too easy -- and
inevitable -- for her spending histories to be combined, store to store, into
an exact, extremely desirable marketing profile of her. Such a monetary dosier
holds valuable information (not to mention private data) about her. She has no
control over it, and derives no compensation from it. <p>

Second, the bank is obliged to hand out whiz-bang smart cards. Banks being
legendary cheapskates, you know who is going to pay for them, at bank rates.
Alice will also have to pay the bank for the transaction costs of using the
money card. <p>

Third, merchants pay the system a small percentage whenever a debit card is
used. This eats into their already-small profits and discourages vendors from
soliciting the card's use for small purchases. <p>

Fourth, Alice can only use her money at establishments equipped with slots
that accept Trust Me's proprietary technology.  This hardware quarantine has
been a prime factor in the non-happening of this future. It also eliminates
person-to-person payments (unless you want to carry a slot around, for others
to poke into). Furthermore, Alice can only refill her card account
(essentially, purchase money) at an official Trust Me ATM branch. This obstacle
could be surmounted by a cooperative network of banks using a universal slot
linked into an internet of all banks; a hint of such a network already exists.
    The alternative to debit-card cash is true digital cash. Digital cash has
none of the debit card's drawbacks.  PAGE 32
                       Whole Earth Review, June 22, 1993 <p>

True digital cash is real money, with the nimbleness of electricity and the
privacy of cash. Payments are accountable, but unlinkable. The cash does not
demand proprietary hardware or software. Therefore, money can be received or
transferred from and to anywhere, including to and from other individuals. You
don't need to be a store or institution to get paid in "non-paper" money.
Anyone connected can collect. And any company with the right reputation can
"sell" electronic-money refills, so the costs are at market rates. Banks are
only peripherally involved. You use digital cash to order a pizza, pay for a
bridge toll, or reimburse a friend, as well as to pay the mortgage, if you
want. It is different from plain old electronic money in that it can be
anonymous and untraceable, except by the payer. It is fueled by encryption. <p>

The method, technically known as blinded digital signatures, is based on a
variant of public-key encryption.  Here's how it works at the consumer level.
You use a digicash card to pay Joe's Meat Market for a prime roast. The
merchant can verify (by examining the digital signature of the bank issuing the
money) that he has been paid with money that has not been paid with money that
has not been spent before. Yet he'll have no record of who paid him. After the
transaction, the bank has a verifiable account that you spent $ 7, and spent it
only once, and that Joe's Meat Market did indeed receive $ 7. But those two
sides of the transaction are not linked, and cannot be reconstructed, unless
you the payer enable them to be. It seems illogical at first that such blind,
but verifiable, transactions can occur, but the integrity of their
"disconnection" is pretty watertight. <p>

Digital cash can replace every use of pocket cash, except flipping a coin.
You have a complete record of all your payments, and to whom they were made. <p>

The privacy and agility of digital cash stems from a simple and clever
technology. When I ask a digicash-card entrepreneur if I can see one of his
smart cards, he says that he's sorry. He thought he had put one in his wallet,
but can't find it. It looks like a regular credit card, he says, showing me his
very small collection of them. It looks like...why, here it is! He slips out a
blank, very thin, flexible card. The plastic rectangle holds math money. In one
corner is a small gold square the dimensions of a thumbnail. This is a
computer.  The CPU, no larger than a soggy cornflake, contains a limited amount
of cash, say $ 500 or 100 transactions, whichever comes first. This one, made
by Cylink 2 , contains a coprocessor specifically designed to handle public-key
encryption mathematics. On the computer's gold square are six very minute
surface contacts, which connect with an online computer when the card is
inserted into a slot. <p>

Less-smart cards (they don't do encryption) are big in Europe and Japan,
where 61 million of them are already in use.  Japan is afloat in a primitive
type of electronic currency -- prepaid magnetic phone cards. The Japanese
national phone company, NTT, has so far sold 330 million (some 10 million per
month) of them. Forty percent of the French carry smart cards in their wallets
today to make phone calls. New York City recently introduced a cashless phone
card for a few of its 58,000 public phone booths.  New York is motivated not by
futurism, but by thieves. According to The New York Times, "Every three
minutes, a thief, a vandal, or some other telephone thug beaks into a coin box
or yanks a handset from a socket. That's more than 175,000 times a year," and
it costs the city $ 10 million annually for repairs. The disposable phone card
New York uses is not very smart, but it's adequate. It employs an infrared
optical memory, common in European phone cards, which is hard to counterfeit in
small quantities but cheap to manufacture in large numbers.  PAGE 33
                       Whole Earth Review, June 22, 1993 <p>

In Denmark, smart cards substitute for the credit cards the Danes never
got.  So everyone who would tote a credit card in America, packs a smart debit
card in Denmark. Danish law demanded two significant restrictions: 1) that
there be no minimum purchase amount; 2) that there be no surcharge for the
card's use. The immediate effect was that the cards began to replace cash in
everyday use, even more than checks and credit cards have replaced cash in the
States. The popularity of these cards is their undoing, because unlike cheap,
decentralized phone cards, these cards rely on real-time interactions with
banks. They are overloading the Danish banking system, hogging phone lines as
the sale of each piece of candy is transmitted to the central bank, flooding
the system with transactions that cost more than they are worth. <p>

David Chaum, a Berkeley cryptographer now living in Holland, has a
solution.  Chaum, head of the cryptography group at the Center for Mathematics
and Computer Science in Amsterdam, has proposed a mathematical code for a
distributed, true digital-cash system. In his solution, everyone carries around
a refillable smart card that packs anonymous cash. This digicash seamlessly
intermingles with electronic cash from home, company, or government. And it
works offline, freeing the phone system. <p>

Chaum looks like a Berkeley stereo-type: grey beard, full mane of hair tied
back in a ponytail, tweed jacket, sandals. As a grad student, Chaum got
interested in the prospects and problems of electronic voting. For his thesis,
he worked on the idea of a digital signature that could not be faked, an
essential tool for fraudproof electronic elections. From there his interest
drifted to the similar problem in computer network communications: how can you
be sure a document is really from who it claims to be from? At the same time he
wondered: how can you keep certain information private and untraceable? Both
directions -- security and privacy -- led to cryptography and a Ph.D. in that
subject. <p>

Sometime in 1978, Chaum says, "I had this flash of inspiration that it was
possible to make a database of people so that someone could not link them all
together, yet you could prove everything about them was correct. At the time, I
was trying to convince myself that it was not possible, but I saw a loophole,
how you might do it, and I thought, gee ... But it wasn't until 1984 or '85
that I figured out how to actually do that." <p>

"Unconditional untraceability" is what Chaum calls his innovation. When
this code is integrated with the "practically unbreakable security" of a
standard public-key encryption code, the combined encryption scheme can provide
anonymous electronic money, among other things. Chaum's encrypted cash (to
date, none of the other systems anywhere are encrypted) offers several
important practical improvements in a card-based electronic currency. <p>

First, it offers the bonafide privacy of material cash. In the past, if you
bought a subversive pamphlet from a merchant for a dollar, he had a dollar that
was definitely a dollar and could be paid to anyone else; but he had no record
of who gave him that dollar, or any way to provably reconstruct who gave it to
him. In Chaum's digital cash, the merchant likewise gets a digital dollar
transferred from your card (or from an online account), and the bank can prove
that indeed he definitely has one dollar there and no more and no less, but no
one (except you if you want) can prove where that dollar came from.  PAGE 34
                       Whole Earth Review, June 22, 1993 <p>

One minor caveat: the smart-card versions of cash so far implemented are,
alas, as vulnerable and valuable as cash if lost or stolen. However, encryting
them with a PIN password would make them substantially more secure, though also
slightly more hassle to use. Chaum predicts that users of digicash will use
short (four-digit) PINs (or none at all) for minor transactions, and longer
passwords for major ones. Speculating a bit, Chaum says, "To protect herself
from a robber who might force her to give up her passwords at gunpoint, Alice
could use a 'duress code' that would cause the card to appear to operate
normally, while hiding its more valuable assets." <p>

Second, Chaum's card-based system works offline. It does not require
instant verification via phone lines as credit cards do, so the costs are
minimal and perfect for the numerous small-time cash transactions people want
them for -- parking meters, restaurant meals, bus rides, phone calls,
groceries. Transaction records are ganged together and zapped once a day, say,
to the central accountant computer. <p>

During this day's delay, it would theoretically be possible to cheat. <p>

Electronic money systems dealing in larger amounts, running online in
almost real time, have a smaller window of opportunity for cheating -- the
instant between sending and receiving -- but the minute opportunity is still
there.  While it is not theoretically possible to break the privacy aspect of
digital cash (who paid who), if you were desperate enough for small cash, you
could break the security aspect -- has this money been spent? -- with
supercomputers.  By breaking the RSA public-key code, you could use the
compromised key to spend money more than once. That is, until the information
was submitted to the bank and they caught you. For, in a delicious quirk,
Chaum's digital cash is untraceable unless you try to cheat by spending money
more than once. When that happens, the extra bit of information the twice-spent
money now carries is enough to trace the payer. So electronic money is a
anonymous as cash, except for cheaters! <p>

Because of its cheaper costs, the Danish government is making plans to
switch from the Dencard to the Dencoin, an offline system suited to small
change. The computational overhead needed to run a system like this is
nano-small. Each encrypted transaction on a smart card consumes only 64 bytes.
(The previous sentence contains 67 bytes.) A household's yearly financial
record of all income and expenditures would easily fit on one high-density
floppy disk.  Chaum calculates that the existing mainframe computers in banks
would have more than adequate computational horsepower to handle digital cash.
The encryption safeguards of an offline system would reduce much of the
transactional computation that occurs on line over phone lines (for ATMs and
credit-card checks), enabling the same banking computers to cover the increase
in electronic cash. Even if we assume that Chaum guessed wrong about the
computational demands of a scaled-up system, and that he is off by a factor of
ten, computer speed is accelerating so fast that this defers the feasibility of
using existing bank power by only a few years. <p>

In variations on Chaum's basic design, people may also have computer
appliances at home, loaded with digital-cash software, which allow them to pay
other individuals, and get paid, over phone lines. This would be e-money on the
networks. Attached to your email message to your daughter is an electronic $
100 bill. She may use that cash to purchase, via email, an airplane ticket
home. The airline sends the cash to one of their vendors, the flight's meal
caterer. In <p>

PAGE 35
                       Whole Earth Review, June 22, 1993 <p>

Chaum's system nobody has any trace of the money's path. Email and digital cash
are a match made in heaven. Digital cash could fail in real life, but it is
almost certain to flourish in computer networking society. <p>

I asked Chaum what banks think of digital cash. His company(3) has visited
or been visited by most of the big players; do they say, Gee, this threatens
our business? Or do they say, Hmm, this strengthens us, makes us more
efficient?  Chaum: "Well, it ranges. I find the corporate planners in $ 1,000
suits and private dining halls are more interested in it than the lower-level
systems guys, because the planners' job is to look to the future. Banks don't
go about building stuff themselves. They have their systems guys buy stuff from
vendors.  My company is the first vendor of electronic money. I have a very
extensive portfolio of patents on electronic money, in the US, Europe and
elsewhere." Some of Chaum's crypto-anarcho friends give him a hard time about
taking out patents on this work. Chaum tells me in defense, "It turns out that
I was in the field very early, so I wiped out all the basic problems. So most
of the new work now in encrypted electronic money are extensions and
applications of the basic work I did. The thing is, banks don't want to invest
into something that is unprotected. Patents are very helpful in making
electronic money happen." <p>

Chaum is an idealist. He sees security and privacy as a trade-off. His
larger agenda is providing tools for privacy in a networked world, so that
privacy can be balanced with security. In the economics of networks, costs are
disproportionately dependent on the number of other users. To get the Fax
Effect going, you need a critical mass of early adopters. Once beyond the
threshold, the event is unstoppable because it is self-reinforcing. Electronic
cash shows all the signs of having a lower critical-mass threshold than other
implementations of data privacy. Chaum is betting that an electronic cash
system inside an email network, or a card-based electronic cash for a local
public transportation network, has the lowest critical mass of all. <p>

The most eager current customers for digital cash are European city
officials. They see card-based digital cash as the next step beyond the
magnetic fast-passes now issued regularly by most cities' bus and subway
departments. One card is filled with as much bus money as you want. But there
are added advantages: the same card could fit into parking meters, when you did
drive, or be used on trains for longer-distance travel. <p>

Urban planners love the idea of automatic tolls charging vehicles for
downtown entry or crossing a bridge, without having the car stop or slow down.
Bar-code lasers can identify moving cars on the road, and drivers will accept
purchasing vouchers.  What's holding up a finer-grain toll system is the
Orwellian fear that "THEY will have a record of my car's travels." Despite that
fear, automatic tolls that record the cars' identity are already operating in
Oklahoma, Louisiana, and Texas. Three states in the busy Northeast have agreed
to install one compatible system, starting with experimental setups on two <p>

Manhattan/New Jersey bridges. In this system, a tiny card-size radio taped to
the car windshield transmits signals to the toll gate, which deducts the toll
from your account at the gate (not from the card). Similar equipment running on
the Texas turnpike system is 99.99 percent reliable. These proven toll
mechanisms could easily be modified to Chaum's untraceable encrypted payments,
and true electronic cash, if people wanted. <p>

In this way, the same cash card that pays for public transportation can
also be used to cover fees for private transportation. Chaum relates that in
his PAGE 36
                       Whole Earth Review, June 22, 1993 <p>

experience with European cities, the Fax Effect -- the more people online = the
more incentive to join -- takes hold, quickly drawing other uses. Officials
from the phone company get wind of what's up and make it known that they would
like to use the card to rid themselves of a nasty plague called "coins" that
bog public phones down. Newspaper vendors call to inquire if they can use the
card ... soon the economics of networks begin to take over. <p>

Ubiquitous digital cash dovetails well with massive electronic networks.
It's a pretty sound bet that Internet - today's version of the Net - will be
the first place that e-money will infiltrate deeply. Money is another type of
information, a compact type of control. As the net expands, money expands.
Wherever information goes, money is sure to follow. By its decentralized,
distributed nature, encrypted e-money has the same potential for transforming
economic structure as personal computers did for overhauling management and
communication structure. Most importantly, the privacy/security innovations
needed for e-money are instrumental in developing the next level of adaptive
complexity in an information-based society. I'd go so far as to say that truly
digital money -- or, more accurately, the economic mechanics needed for truly
digital cash -- will rewire the nature of our economy, communications, and
knowledge. <p>

The consequential effects of electronic money are already underway. Four we
can expect are: <p>

* Increased velocity. When money is disembodied -- removed from any
material basis at all -- it speeds up. It travels farther, faster. Circulating
money faster has an effect similar to circulating more money. When satellites
went up, enabling near-the-speed-of-light round-the-clock world stock trade,
they expanded the amount of global money by 5 percent. Digital cash used on a
large scale will further increase money's velocity. <p>

* Continuity. Money that is composed of gold, precious materials, or paper
comes in fixed units that are paid at fixed times. The ATM spits out $ 20
bills; that's it. You pay the phone company once a month, even though you use
the phone every day.  This is batch-mode money. Electronic money is
continuous-flow. It allows recurring expenses to be paid, in Alvin Toffler's
phrase, by "bleeding electronically from one's bank account in tiny droplets,
on a minute-by-minute basis." Your e-money account pays for each phone call as
soon as you hang up, or -- how about this -- as you are talking. Payment
coincides with use.  Together with its higher velocity, continuous electronic
money can approach near instantaneity. This puts a crimp on banks, which derive
a lot of their current profit on the "float" -- which instantaneity erases. <p>

* Unlimited fungibility. Finally, really plastic money. Once completely
disembodied, digitized money escapes from a single transmission form and
merrily migrates to whatever medium is handiest. Separate billing fades away.
Accounts can be inter-leaved with the object or service itself. The bill for a
video comes incorporated into the video. Invoices reside alongside of bar
codes, and can be paid with the zap of a laser. Anything that can hold an
electronic charge can hold a fiscal charge. Foreign currencies become a matter
of changing a symbol. Money is as malleable as digitized information. This
makes it all the easier to monetize exchanges and interactions that were never
part of an economy before. It opens the floodgates of commerce onto the net.
PAGE 37
                       Whole Earth Review, June 22, 1993 <p>

* Accessibility. Until now, sophisticated manipulations of money have been
the private domain of professional financial institutions -- a financial
priesthood. But just as a million Macs broke the monopoly of the high priests
guarding access to main-frame computers, so e-money will break the monopoly of
financial Brahmins. Imagine if you could charge (and get) interest on any money
due you by dragging an icon over that electronic invoice. Imagine if you could
factor in the "interest due" icon, and give it variable interest, ballooning as
it aged. Or maybe you would charge interest by the minute if you sent a payment
in early. Or program your personal computer to differentially pay bills
depending on the prime rate -- programmed bill-trading for amateurs. Or perhaps
you would engineer your computer to play with exchange rates, paying bills in
whatever currency is least valuable at the time. All manner of clever financial
instruments will surface once the masses can drink from the same river of
electronic money as the pros. To the list of things to hack, we may now add
finance. We are headed toward programmed capitalism. <p>

* Privatization. The ease with which e-money is caught, flung, and shaped
makes it ideal for private currencies. The 214 billion yen tied up by Japan's
NTT's phone cards is one limited type of private currency. The law of the net
is: he who owns a computer not only owns a printing press, but also a mint,
when that computer is linked to e-money. Para-currencies can pop up anywhere
there is trust (and fail there, too). <p>

Historically, most modern barter networks rapidly slide into exchanges of
real currency; one could expect the same in electronic barter clubs, but the
blinding efficiency of an e-money system may not tend that way. The $ 350
billion tax question is whether para-currency networks would ever rise above
unofficial status. <p>

* The minting and issuing of currency has been one of the few remaining
functions of government that the private sector has not encroached upon.
E-money will lower this formidable barrier. By doing so it will provide a
powerful tool to private governance systems, such as might be established by
renegade ethnic groups, or the "edge cities" proliferating near the world's
megacities. The use of institutional electronic money transfers to launder
money on a global scale is already out of anyone's control. <p>

The Yin of the Network's Yang <p>

The nature of e-money -- invisible, lightning-quick, cheap, globally
penetrating -- is likely to produce indelible underground economies, a worry
way beyond mere laundering of drug money. In the net-world, where a global
economy is rooted in distributed knowledge and decentralized control, e-money
is not an option but a necessity. Para-currencies will flourish as the Grand
Net flourishes. The electronic matrix is destined to be an outback of hardy
underwire economies. The net is so amicable to electronic cash that once
established interstitially in the net's links, e-money is probably
ineradicable. <p>

In fact, the legality of anonymous digital cash is in limbo from the start.
There are now strict limits to the size of transactions US citizens can make
with physical cash; try depositing $ 10,000 in greenbacks in a bank. At what
amount will the government limit anonymous digital cash? The drift of all
governments is to demand fuller and fuller disclosures of financial
transactions (to make sure they get their cut of tax) and to halt unlawful
transactions (as in the War on Drugs). The prospect of allowing untraceable
commerce to bloom PAGE 38
                       Whole Earth Review, June 22, 1993 <p>

on a federally subsidized network would probably have the US government
seriously worried, if they were thinking about it. But they aren't. A cashless
society smells like stale science fiction, and the phrase reminds every
bureaucrat drowning in paper of the unfulfilled predictions of a paperless
society. Eric Hughes, maintainer of the cypherpunks' mailing list, says, <p>

* "The Really Big Question is, how large can the flow of money on the nets
get before the government requires reporting of every small transaction?
Because if the flows can get large enough, past some threshold, then there
might be enough aggregate money to provide an economic incentive for a
transnational service to issue money, and it wouldn't matter what one
government does." <p>

Hughes envisions multiple outlets for electronic money springing up all
over the global net. The vendors would act like traveler's-check companies.
They would issue e-money for, say, a 1 percent surcharge. You could then spend
Internet Express checks wherever anyone accepted them. But somewhere on the
global net, underwire economies would dawn, perhaps sponsored by the
governments of struggling developing countries. Like the Swiss banks of old,
these digital <p>

banks would offer unreported transactions. Paying in online Nigerian nairas
from a house in Connecticut would be no more difficult than using US dollars.
"The interesting market experiment," Hughes says, "is to see what the
difference in the charge for anonymous money is, once the market equalizes. I
bet it'll be on the order of 1 to 3 percent higher, with an upper limit of
about 10 percent.  That amount will be the first real measure of what financial
privacy is worth.  It might also be the case that anonymous money will be the
only kind of money." <p>

Usable electronic money may be the most important outcome of a sudden
grassroots takeover of the formerly esoteric and forbidden field of codes and
ciphers. Everyday e-money is one novel use for encryption that never would have
occurred to the military. There are certainly many potential uses of
 encryption that the cypherpunks' own ideological leanings blind them to, and
that will have to wait until encryption technology enters the mainstream -- as
it certainly will. <p>

To date, encryption has birthed the following: digital signatures, blind
credentials (you have a diploma that says: Yes you have a Ph.D., but no one can
link that diploma with your other diploma from traffic school), anonymous
email, electronic money.  These species of disconnection thrive as networks
thrive. <p>

Encryption wins because it is the necessary counterforce to the net's
runaway tendency to connect everything. It is a prime technology of
disconnection. The net says, "Just connect." The cipher says, "Disconnect."
Encipherment is the complementary technology to the technology of cheap copying
and linking. Without some force of disconnection, the world would freeze up in
an overloaded tangle of unprivate connections and unfiltered information. <p>

I'm listening to the cypherpunks, not because I think that anarchy is a
solution to anything, but because it seems to me that encryption technology
civilizes the gridlocking avalanche of knowledge and data that networked
systems generate. A cipher is the yin for the network's yang, a tiny hidden
force that is able to tame the explosive interconnections born of
decentralized, distributed systems. <p>

John Gilmore has sent a Freedom Of Information Act (FOIA) request for
the database of escrowed key components.  These are the half-keys that 
will be required to decrypt conversations on the pre-wiretapped
Clipper encrypted telephones. <p>

The idea behind FOIA is that the U S Government should be accountable
to its citizens by having its files and databases open to public
inspection.  The mechanism for doing this is to file a FOIA request to
a government agency, and they are supposed to send you what you ask
for, with some exceptions.  Requesting the Clipper key databases seems
silly at first, but really it strikes at the heart of why Clipper is
such a bad idea:  FOIA prevents government from collecting information
about citizens that the citizens themselves cannot be trusted with.  If
we do not want other citizens listening in to our private conversations, 
the government has no business doing it, either, because they should be 
working *for* us. <p>

BTW, Eric Hughes points out that "escrowed" is not really the right
word.  An escrow agent is someone chosen and agreed to by both parties
to hold something for future release under certain conditions.  In the
case of Clipper Keys, both parties do not get to agree to who the
escrow agents are.  They are chosen for you: one is the U S Treasury
department, whose Secret Service brought you the Steve Jackson Games
fiasco; the other is NIST, who is plowing ahead with the Clipper
standard despite a nearly unanimous response against it during their
period of public comment. <p>

It looks like John has created a mailing list foia-keys-request@toad.com 
if you're interested in following this.  The Cypherpunks list is still at
cypherpunks-request@toad.com.                 --strick <p>

From: gnu@toad.com <p>

There appears to be no FOIA exemption that would justify withholding
the key escrow databases which Treasury and NIST are building.  (The
keys are not tied to any individual, so individual privacy isn't a
valid exemption.  The database isn't classified.  Etc.)  I have asked
for a copy of each database, in toto.  Letters were sent yesterday.
One is reproduced below; the other is identical except for the
addressee and minor details. <p>

You too can do things like this.  It's fun and it occasionally
produces highly useful information.  Just think of something that the
government knows, and has written down on paper, that you want to
know.  Ask them for it.  You have the right to know.  They're spending
your taxes to subjugate you, and they're required to answer, though
almost all agencies do it grudgingly.  Post your request to the net,
so that we-all will know it's happening, and can be inspired to think
of other interesting things to ask for. <p>

You don't need all the boilerplate below about exemptions and time
limits and stuff; that is to put the agencies on notice that we will
push them in court, if necessary, to be responsive.  Or you can use
our boilerplate in your own requests, if you like.  Alter the "media
requester" section to suit your own situation. <p>

Should John's FOIA request for the clipper key database work, it
creates a wonderful hole in the entire key custody system. <p>

It would require a legislative act to plug the hole. <p>

This is extremely significant, since the whole clipper strategy is
based on unchecked and unbalanced actions by the executive branch.  No
laws were passed to create clipper and no judicial review has taken
place. <p>

John's request will be denied, no doubt, and will go to court.  Should
he prevail in court, the executive branch is bound by that decision.
A key custody database which was public would make the system insecure
and unusable.  The executive branch could not change this.  Only the
legislature could. <p>

Now, how many legislators do you know that are going to make a public
record by voting in favor of Big Brother? <p>

We are witnessing the genius of framers of the USA Constitution here,
folks. <p>

&gt; I confess -- I expect one of two outcomes.  First, they may say that
&gt; the database is classified, if only at the level of ``For Official
&gt; Use Only''. <p>

`For Official Use Only' is not a valid classification.  A document
with this marking cannot be withheld under FOIA exemption 1.  You have
to read the Executive Orders on classification -- this category got
cleaned up a LONG time ago. <p>

The current Executive Order gives particular criteria for classifying
things.  If this database doesn't fit any of those criteria, it can't
legally be classified.  I don't believe that this database is covered.
And a judge in a FOIA case can do a "de novo" (from scratch) review of
whether the material is legally classified, by examining it himself in
private -- we don't have to take the agency's word that "there really
is some reason it is classified". <p>

Also, giving classified information to unauthorized people is a major
offense.  They threatened me with that offense one time, over texts
that I found in a library.  If the keys in the database are
classified, they can't give them out to cops.  FOIA requires that they
"segregate" any classified part and give me the rest of what's there,
so if they claim that "well, one key isn't classified, but ten or a
thousand of them are classified", I bet we can (1) get some keys out,
(2) challenge this idea in court.  In particular, it should be
possible to record the LEAF from a particular chip (whether you own
it, or not!) and send it to them in a FOIA request asking for the
matching unit key.  They clearly can map a LEAF to a key (they do it
for cops), and FOIA only requires that you "reasonably describe" the
records you want.  Given their mapping capability, the LEAF is a
reasonable description of the record you want. <p>

&gt; Second, maybe they will release it -- but remember that
&gt; the keys are stored encrypted.  Can you file an FOIA request for the
&gt; key, too? <p>

Either I can get the key, or I can get them to decrypt it for me.  If
they could hold arbitrary government records in secret by simply
encrypting them and classifying the keys, FOIA would be entirely
thwarted; the courts wouldn't let them get away with it. <p>

By the way, I did request the keys: <p>

&gt; This request includes your database of the escrowed key
&gt; components.  This request also includes any ancillary information
&gt; about the database, such as data formats, procedures, standards,
&gt; access methods, memos and documents about its use, access
&gt; software, plans, etc.  If the database itself is stored in encrypted
&gt; form, then this request also includes the computer programs and
&gt; keys required to access it. <p>

Reference:  KEY ESCROW DATABASE-TREASURY <p>

Departmental Disclosure Office
Department of the Treasury
Room 1054-MT
Washington, D.C.  20220
ATTN:  FOIA request <p>

Dear Sir or Madam: <p>

This is a request under the Freedom of Information Act [5 
U.S.C. Sec. 552] on behalf of my client, Mr. John Gilmore.   <p>

I write to request a copy of all agency records or portions 
thereof, in electronic or other form, which relate to the database of 
escrowed key components for encryption using the key escrow 
encryption method.  The Attorney General announced on Friday, 
February 4, 1994, that the Automated Systems Division of the 
Department of the Treasury will be one of the two escrow agents.   <p>

This request includes your database of the escrowed key 
components.  This request also includes any ancillary information 
about the database, such as data formats, procedures, standards, 
access methods, memos and documents about its use, access 
software, plans, etc.  If the database itself is stored in encrypted 
form, then this request also includes the computer programs and 
keys required to access it.  <p>

We specifically request that you make the database available in 
electronic form, such as on magnetic tape.  We remind you that the 
long-standing rule that the FOIA "makes no distinction between 
records maintained in manual and computer storage systems," 
Yeager v. D.E.A., 678 F.2d 315, 321 (D.C.Cir. 1982), has recently 
been amplified in Armstrong v. Executive Office of the President, 
810 F.Supp. 335 (D.D.C. 1993).  Any paper print-outs of electronic 
records, such as e-mail, must include all information in the 
electronic record.  Assuming that there would be no loss of 
releasable information, such as written comments made on paper 
print-outs, we therefore ask you to release all responsive electronic 
records in electronic, i.e., machine-readable, form.   <p>

As you know, the FOIA provides that an agency must make an 
initial determination of whether to comply with a FOIA request 
within ten working days of receiving the request.   <p>

If the records that you possess were originated or classified by 
another organization, I ask that your organization declassify them 
(if needed) and release them to me, as provided in the FOIA, 
within the statutory time limits.  If there is a conflict between the 
statutory time limits and some regulation or policy that requires 
you to refer the records, the statutory requirement takes precedence 
over any Executive-branch regulation, policy or practice.   <p>

Congress placed a limit on the time which may be expended in 
referrals.  The FOIA explicitly provides that referrals to other 
interested agencies or agency components are treated under the 
provision for "unusual circumstances," and cannot justify a delay 
of more than an additional 10 working days.  5 U.S.C. Sec. 
552(a)(6)(B)(iii).    <p>

"[W]hen an agency receives a FOIA request for 'agency 
records' in its possession it must take responsibility for processing 
the request.  It cannot simply refuse to act on the ground that the 
documents originated elsewhere."  McGehee v. C.I.A., 697 F.2d 
1095, 1110 (D.C. Cir. 1983).   Even records originated by other 
agencies are subject to immediate release under the applicable case 
law, if they were at the time of the request in the possession and 
control of your agency. <p>

Simply put, the FOIA and the case law take precedence over 
executive branch regulations or practices regarding referrals.  If 
you do refer documents to any other agency, and they are not 
provided within the time limits, we intend to litigate on this 
point. <p>

As you know, the FOIA provides that even if some requested 
material is properly exempted from mandatory disclosure, all 
segregable portions must be released.  [5 U.S.C. Sec. 552(b)]  If any 
or all material covered by this request is withheld, please inform 
me of the specific exemptions that are being claimed, and mark all 
deletions to indicate the exemption(s) being claimed to authorize 
each individual withholding.  If the (b)(3) exemption is claimed, 
please indicate the relevant withholding statute(s). <p>

If any records are withheld, I request a Vaughn index or its 
equivalent during the administrative process.  "[T]he objective of 
the Vaughn requirements, to permit the requesting party to present 
its case effectively, is equally applicable to proceedings within the 
agency."  Mead Data Central v. Department of the Air Force, 402 
F.Supp. 460 (D.D.C. 1974), remanded, 566 F.2d 242 (D.C. Cir. 
1977) aff'd, 575 F.2d 932 (D.C. Cir. 1978).   <p>

"[A] person cannot effectively appeal a decision about the 
releasability of documents ... if he is not informed of at 
least a list of the documents to which he was denied access 
... and why those decisions were made.  Denial of this 
information would in all likelihood be a denial of due 
process as well as effectively gutting the reasons for 
applying the exhaustion doctrine in FOIA cases." <p>

Shermco Industries, Inc. v. Secretary of the Air Force, 452 F.Supp. 
306, 317 n.7 (N.D. Tex. 1978); see Oglesby v. Department of the 
Army, 920 F.2d 57, 65 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (citing Shermco).   It 
should be simple to prepare a list and the claimed exemptions as 
the records are processed.  Disclosing such information would not 
disclose any exempt information and it would make it easier to 
appeal your initial determination on the merits.   <p>

In addition, I ask that your agency exercise its discretion to 
release information that may be technically exempt.  As you know, 
the Attorney General on October 4, 1993, directed that agencies 
should administer the FOIA under a presumption of disclosure, and 
that information which need not be withheld should not be. <p>

I remind you that under Chrysler v. Brown, 441 U.S. 281, 293 
(1979), the 5 U.S.C. Sec. 552(b) exemptions are discretionary, not 
mandatory.  An agency can generally choose to release exempt 
information.  This discretionary review process for withholding 
cannot take precedence over the law, which requires a response 
within specified time limits.  Moreover, that discretion, according 
to the Attorney General's October 4, 1993 memorandum, must be 
exercised in accordance with a presumption of disclosure.  Even if 
a substantial legal basis exists for withholding, information is not 
to be withheld unless it need be.   <p>

I also request that fees be waived because Mr. Gilmore should 
be deemed a media requester by your agency for FOIA purposes, 
and because the public interest would be furthered by a fee waiver.   <p>

The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals has held that "a 
representative of the news media is, in essence, a person or entity 
that gathers information of potential interest to a segment of the 
public, uses its editorial skills to turn the raw materials into a 
distinct work, and distributes that work to an audience."  National 
Security Archive v. Department of Defense, 880 F.2d 1381, 1387 
(D.C.Cir. 1989), cert. denied 494 U.S. 1029 (1990).   <p>

This definition applies strongly to Mr. Gilmore, who is a co-
founder and director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), a 
Washington, D.C.-based public interest organization.  The EFF has 
been intimately involved in policy discussions concerning key 
escrow encryption and distributes information to the public by 
newsletter and electronic distribution about this and other topics 
involving civil liberties.   Mr. Gilmore is also a skilled computer 
programmer who has spent the last ten years distributing his work 
for public use to a worldwide audience on the Internet and the 
Usenet.   <p>

Mr. Gilmore is also entitled to a fee waiver because "disclosure 
of the information is in the public interest because it is likely to 
contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations 
or activities of the government and is not primarily in the 
commercial interest of the requester."   <p>

There exists a tremendous public debate over the wisdom and 
legality of the key escrow encryption plan, as I am sure you are 
well aware.  Your agency's database is clearly an operation of the 
government in which the public has a great interest.  The Vice 
President himself has publicly expressed doubt about the 
delegating key escrow responsibilities to agencies which are part of 
the executive branch.  The information requested herein relates to 
such doubt.  This information is not yet in the public record, so the 
request makes a substantial contribution to the public 
understanding.   <p>

This request is not primarily in the commercial interest of Mr. 
Gilmore.  He will not benefit financially from this information in 
any way.  He intends to disseminate the requested records widely 
and freely to inform this public debate.    <p>

Should there be any problem in this regard, Mr. Gilmore 
promises to pay up to $1000 in fees, and you should therefore 
begin processing of this request without fee-related delays.   <p>

As provided under the FOIA, I will expect a reply within ten 
(10) working days.   <p>

Sincerely, <p>

Lee Tien
Attorney at Law
On behalf of Mr. John Gilmore <p>

Vice President Al Gore's comments: <p>

By Jay Levin (C) 1994
				From New York Unix Vol 4 #3.
				WASHINGTON, Feb 11 <p>

Under the Clipper plan, the keys would be stored at the
	Treasury Department and the National Insitute of Standards and
	Technology (NIST), whic is part of the Commerce Department.
	Both Treasury and Commerce are from the same branch of
	government, the executive branch. <p>

"When I saw that I said 'Wow.  That is not right,' and I raised
	hell about that," Gore said in an interview Thursday. <p>

Having the key holders from the same branch of government
	raises concern because there is no systems of checks and
	balances, Gore said.  "That's going to be changed," he said. <p>

... The selection of NIST and Treasury "was spun out of the process
	at the low level and was not vetted at the top," Gore said.
	Gore's comments were made after appearing before the first
	meeting of a private sector advisory panel on the development
	of a "national information infrastructure" in Washington, D.C. <p>

From: Carl Ellison &lt;cme@sw.stratus.com&gt; <p>

&gt;The FBI and the Justice Department say the initiative would
	&gt;not expand their power, but would ensure access to the type of
	&gt;communications they have been entitled to tap for years. <p>

This is totally bogus. <p>

The FBI has never had the right to watch computer programs
	execute.  Now that computer programs are being written as
	distributed systems, what was originally written to be an
	internal subroutine call can look like a message over the phone
	system. <p>

The FBI never had the right to bug corporate conference rooms.
	Now that companies are using videoconferencing, a private
	corporate conference could look like a phone call. <p>

Etc. <p>

This needs to be fought. <p>

 Bob Metcalfe on Clipper <p>

CLIPPER CHIP OPPOSITION
InfoWorld publisher Bob Metcalfe states in a Wall Street Journal op-ed
piece that he is against Clipper Chip technology, but for different reasons
than those cited by the ACLU and the Electronic Frontier Foundation. Rather
than getting steamed up about the right to privacy issue, which he notes
was always a conditional right anyway, Metcalfe says, "I am against Clipper
simply because it will not work, and it will cost an unnecessary amount of
tax money to outfit government computers with the chips." Even if Clipper
were built into every computer and phone system, "smart criminals can
easily get around Clipper by using additional encryption. Stupid criminals
will continue to do stupid things and get caught." (Wall Street Journal
3/22/94 A14) <p>

Readers are invited to repost this to any relevant newsgroups I've omitted,
as long as they post it unaltered. They are welcome to comment in "reply"
messages, either by posting or e-mail. <p>

Over the past several months a debate has been raging here about the Clipper
Chip. It has been marked by name-calling, incivility, the mocking of
rational arguments when writers were unable to respond, and much barnyard
behavior in general. Through it all I've been making a number of arguments,
and presenting a number of hypotheses based on simple logic and common
sense. Having no access to "inside" information, I've had to rely on that
approach, which is based on the simple notion that my teachers had something
worthwhile to impart to me during my student days. <p>

Now the NSA has spoken out officially. In The Wall Street Journal of March
22, 1994, on page B1 there is an interview with the Clipper Chip project
leader, Clinton Brooks of the NSA. The interview officially confirms the key
points of my advocacy. <p>

1. The original purpose of the Clipper Chip was to protect U.S. civilian
communications. The escrow is laid on top of that for law enforcement
purposes. <p>

"the NSA is consumed with the 'equities problem'--how to balance privacy
rights against the needs of law enforcement, national security, and private
industry." <p>

"began discussion about how to improve computer security without making it
impenetrable to police" <p>

2. The Clipper Chip algorithm, Capstone is algorithmically highly secure. <p>

"The team decided against using a weak encryption code. ...it had to be good
security." <p>

3. The Clipper Chip does not contain a trapdoor. <p>

"it also rejected a so-called trapdoor approach in which the computer code
would be designed so it would have a weak spot--a trapdoor--that federal
agencies could enter via computer to tap the communications. Someone else
could discover the trapdoor, they decided." <p>

4. The reason the algorithm is secret is so that others cannot use such a
strong algorithm without escrow. <p>

"It would defeat the purpose [of the project] if we gave the knowledge of
how the algorithm worked" to the public..."It was going to have to be kept
classified." "Otherwise engineers could use the algorithm to design
computer-security systems that the government's encryption keys couldn't
unlock." <p>

5. The reason for the NSA's involvement is that they're the best experts we
have and not because of some sinister secret plot. <p>

"The only reason we're involved is that we have the best
cryptomathematicians in the country." <p>

Now it's possible he's lying in his teeth. But such a hypothesis would also
require lots of people up and down the NSA, the NSA's reporting
organizations, NIST, the civilian review board, the White House, and the
President all to be lying or systematically lied to. <p>

That's far too complicated a hypothesis to be credible compared with the
simpler one that he and everyone up the line is telling the truth. There are
too many cooks in this one for a "plot" to be sustained, and the damage if
there were a plot and anyone "leaked" too great. The many people involved
are not going to stake their personal credibility and that of the President
on this one. <p>

 Gore GII Buenos Aires Speech <p>

Remarks prepared for delivery <p>

By <p>

Vice President AL GORE <p>

International Telecommunications Union <p>

Monday March 21, 1994 <p>

I have come here, 8,000 kilometers from my home, to ask you to help
create a Global Information Infrastructure.  To explain why, I want to
begin by reading you something that I first read in high school, 30
years ago. <p>

"By means of electricity, the world of matter has become a great nerve,
vibrating thousands of miles in a breathless point of time. . . . The
round globe is a vast . . . brain, instinct with intelligence!" <p>

This was not the observation of a physicist -- or a neurologist.
Instead, these visionary words were written in 1851 by Nathaniel
Hawthorne, one of my country's greatest writers, who was inspired by
the development of the telegraph.  Much as Jules Verne foresaw
submarines and moon landings, Hawthorne foresaw what we are now poised
to bring into being. <p>

The ITU was created only 14 years later, in major part for the purpose
of fostering an internationally compatible system of telegraphy. <p>

For almost 150 years, people have aspired to fulfill Hawthorne's
vision--to wrap nerves of communications around the globe, linking all
human knowledge. <p>

In this decade, at this conference, we now have at hand the
technological breakthroughs and economic means to bring all the
communities of the world together.  We now can at last create a
planetary information network that transmits messages and images with
the speed of light from the largest city to the smallest village on
every continent. <p>

I am very proud to have the opportunity to address the first
development conference of the ITU because the President of the United
States and I believe that an essential prerequisite to sustainable
development, for all members of the human family, is the creation of
this network of networks.  To accomplish this purpose, legislators,
regulators, and businesspeople must do this:  build and operate a
Global Information Infrastructure.  This GII will circle the globe with
information superhighways on which all people can travel. <p>

These highways--or, more accurately, networks of distributed
intelligence--will allow us to share information, to connect, and to
communicate as a global community.  From these connections we will
derive robust and sustainable economic progress, strong democracies,
better solutions to global and local environmental challenges, improved
health care, and--ultimately--a greater sense of shared stewardship of
our small planet. <p>

The Global Information Infrastructure will help educate our children
and allow us to exchange ideas in within a community and among
nations.  It will be a means by which families and friends will
transcend the barriers of time and distance.  It will make possible a
global information marketplace, where consumers can buy or sell
products.  I ask you, the delegates to this conference, to set an
ambitious agenda that will help all governments, in their own sovereign
nations and in international cooperation, to build this Global
Information Infrastructure.  For my country's part, I pledge our
vigorous, continued participation in achieving this goal--in the
development sector of the ITU, in other sectors and in plenipotentiary
gatherings of the ITU, and in bilateral discussions held by our
Departments of State and Commerce and our Federal Communications
Commission. <p>

The development of the GII must be a cooperative effort among
governments and peoples.  It cannot be dictated or built by a single
country.  It must be a democratic effort. <p>

And the distributed intelligence of the GII will spread participatory
democracy. <p>

To illustrate why, I'd like to use an example from computer science.
In the past, all computers were huge mainframes with a single
processing unit, solving problems in sequence, one by one, each bit of
information sent back and forth between the CPU and the vast field of
memory surrounding it.  Now, we have massively parallel computers with
hundreds -- or thousands --- of tiny self- contained processors
distributed throughout the memory field, all interconnected, and
together far more powerful and more versatile than even the most
sophisticated single processor, because they each solve a tiny piece of
the problem simultaneously and when all the pieces are assembled, the
problem is solved. <p>

Similarly, the GII will be an assemblage of local, national, and
regional networks, that are not only like parallel computers but in
their most advanced state will in fact be a distributed, parallel
computer. <p>

In a sense, the GII will be a metaphor for democracy itself.
Representative democracy does not work with an all-powerful central
government, arrogating all decisions to itself.  That is why communism
collapsed. <p>

Instead, representative democracy relies on the assumption that the
best way for a nation to make its political decisions is for each
citizen -- the human equivalent of the self-contained processor -- to
have the power to control his or her own life. <p>

To do that, people must have available the information they need.  And
be allowed to express their conclusions in free speech and in votes
that are combined with those of millions of others.  That's what guides
the system as a whole. <p>

The GII will not only be a metaphor for a functioning democracy, it
will in fact promote the functioning of democracy by greatly enhancing
the participation of citizens in decision-making.  And it will greatly
promote the ability of nations to cooperate with each other.  I see an
new Athenian Age of democracy forged in the fora the GII will create. <p>

The GII will be the key to economic growth for national and
international economies.  For us in the United States, the information
infrastructure already is to the U.S. economy of the 1990s what
transport infrastructure was to the economy of the mid-20th century.
The integration of computing and information networks into the economy
makes U.S. manufacturing companies more productive, more competitive,
and more adaptive to changing conditions and it will do the same for
the economies of other nations. <p>

These same technologies are also enabling the service sectors of the
U.S.  economy to grow, to increase their scale and productivity and
expand their range of product offerings and ability to respond to
customer demands. <p>

Approximately 60% of all U.S. workers are "knowledge workers" -- people
whose jobs depend on the information they generate and receive over our
information infrastructure.  As we create new jobs, 8 out of 10 are in
information-intensive sectors of our economy.  And these new jobs are
well-paying jobs for financial analysts, computer programmers, and
other educated workers. <p>

The global economy also will be driven by the growth of the Information
Age.  Hundreds of billions of dollars can be added to world growth if
we commit to the GII.  I fervently hope this conference will take full
advantage of this potential for economic growth, and not deny any
country or community its right to participate in this growth. <p>

As the GII spreads, more and more people realize that information is a
treasure that must be shared to be valuable.  When two people
communicate, they each can be enriched--and unlike traditional
resources, the more you share, the more you have.  As Thomas Jefferson
said, "He who receives an idea from me, receives instruction himself
without lessening mine; as he who lights his taper at mine, receives
light without darkening me." <p>

Now we all realize that, even as we meet here, the Global Information
Infrastructure is being built, although many countries have yet to see
any benefits. <p>

Digital telecommunications technology, fiber optics, and new
high-capacity satellite systems are transforming telecommunications.
And all over the world, under the seas and along the roads, pipelines,
and railroads, companies are laying fiber optic cable that carries
thousands of telephone calls per second over a single strand of glass. <p>

These developments are greatly reducing the cost of building the GII.
In the past, it could take years to build a network.  Linking a single
country's major cities might require laying thousands of kilometers of
expensive wires.  Today, a single satellite and a few dozen ground
stations can be installed in a few months -- at much lower cost. <p>

The economics of networks have changed so radically that the operation
of a competitive, private market can build much of the GII.  This is
dependent, however, upon sensible regulation. <p>

Within the national boundaries of the U.S. we aspire to build our
information highways according to a set of principles that I outlined
in January in California.  The National Information Infrastructure, as
we call it, will be built and maintained by the private sector.  It
will consist of hundreds of different networks, run by different
companies and using different technologies, all connected together in a
giant "network of networks," providing telephone and interactive
digital video to almost every American. <p>

Our plan is based on five principles: First, encourage private
investment; Second, promote competition; Third, create a flexible
regulatory framework that can keep pace with rapid technological and
market changes; Fourth, provide open access to the network for all
information providers; and Fifth, ensure universal service. <p>

Are these principles unique to the United States?  Hardly.  Many are
accepted international principles endorsed by many of you.  I believe
these principles can inform and aid the development of the Global
Information Infrastructure and urge this Conference to incorporate
them, as appropriate, into the Buenos Aires Declaration, which will be
drafted this week. <p>

Let me elaborate briefly on these principles. <p>

First, we propose that private investment and competition be the
foundation for development of the GII.   In the U.S., we are in the
process of opening our communications markets to all domestic private
participants. <p>

In recent years, many countries, particularly here in Latin America,
have opted to privatize their state-owned telephone companies in order
to obtain the benefits and incentives that drive competitive private
enterprises, including innovation, increased investment, efficiency and
responsiveness to market needs. <p>

Adopting policies that allow increased private sector participation in
the telecommunications sector has provided an enormous spur to
telecommunications development in dozens of countries, including
Argentina, Venezuela, Chile, and Mexico.  I urge you to follow their
lead. <p>

But privatization is not enough.  Competition is needed as well.  In
the past, it did make sense to have telecommunications monopolies. <p>

In many cases, the technology and the economies of scale meant it was
inefficient to build more than one network.  In other cases--Finland,
Canada, and the U.S., for example--national networks were built in the
early part of this century by hundreds of small, independent phone
companies and cooperatives. <p>

Today, there are many more technology options than in the past and it
is not only possible, but desirable, to have different companies
running competing--but interconnected--networks, because competition is
the best way to make the telecommunications sector more efficient, more
innovative--and more profitable as consumers make more calls and prices
decline. <p>

That is why allowing other companies to compete with AT&amp;T, once the
world's largest telephone monopoly, was so useful for the United
States.  Over the last ten years, it has cut the cost of a
long-distance telephone call in the U.S. more than 50%. <p>

To promote competition and investment in global telecommunications, we
need to adopt cost-based collection and accounting rates.  Doing so
will accelerate development of the GII. <p>

International standards to ensure interconnection and interoperability
are needed as well.  National networks must connect effectively with
each other to make real the simple vision of linking schools,
hospitals, businesses, and homes to a Global Information
Infrastructure. <p>

Hand in hand with the need for private investment and competition is
the necessity of appropriate and flexible regulations developed by an
authoritative regulatory body. <p>

In order for the private sector to invest and for initiatives opening a
market to competition to be successful, it is necessary to create a
regulatory environment that fosters and protects competition and
private sector investments, while at the same time protecting
consumers' interests. <p>

Without the protection of an independent regulator, a potential private
investor would be hesitant to provide service in competition with the
incumbent provider for fear that the incumbent's market power would not
be adequately controlled. <p>

Decisions and the basis for making them must also be made public so
that consumers and potential competitors are assured that their
interests are being protected. <p>

This is why in the U.S., we have delegated significant regulatory
powers to an independent agency, the Federal Communications
Commission.  This expert body is well-equipped to make difficult
technical decisions and to monitor, in conjunction with the National
Telecommunications and Information Administration and the Department of
Justice, changing market conditions.  We commend this approach to you. <p>

We need a flexible, effective system for resolution of international
issues, too-- one that can keep up with the ever-accelerating pace of
technological change. <p>

I understand that the ITU has just gone through a major reorganization
designed to increase its effectiveness.  This will enable the ITU,
under the able leadership of Mr. Tarjanne, to streamline its operations
and redirect resources to where they are needed most.  This will ensure
that the ITU can adapt to future and unimaginable technologies. <p>

Our fourth principle is open access.  By this I mean that telephone and
video network owners should charge non-discriminatory prices for access
to their networks.  This principle will guarantee every user of the GII
can use thousands of different sources of information--video
programming, electronic newspapers, computer bulletin boards--from
every country, in every language. <p>

With new technologies like direct broadcast satellites, a few networks
will no longer be able to control your access to information--as long
as government policies permit new entrants into the information
marketplace. <p>

Countries and companies will not be able to compete in the global
economy if they cannot get access to up-to-date information, if they
cannot communicate instantly with customers around the globe.  Ready
access to information is also essential for training the skilled
workforce needed for high-tech industries. <p>

The countries that flourish in the twenty-first century will be those
that have telecommunications policies and copyright laws that provide
their citizens access to a wide choice of information services.
Protecting intellectual property is absolutely essential. <p>

The final and most important principle is to ensure universal service
so that the Global Information Infrastructure is available to all
members of our societies.  Our goal is a kind of global conversation,
in which everyone who wants can have his or her say. <p>

We must ensure that whatever steps we take to expand our worldwide
telecommunications infrastructure, we keep that goal in mind. <p>

Although the details of universal service will vary from country to
country and from service to service, several aspects of universal
service apply everywhere.  Access clearly includes making service
available at affordable prices to persons at all income levels.  It
also includes making high quality service available regardless of
geographic location or other restrictions such as disability. <p>

Constellations of hundreds of satellites in low earth orbit may soon
provide telephone or data services to any point on the globe.  Such
systems could make universal service both practical and affordable. <p>

An equally important part of universal access is teaching consumers how
to use communications effectively.  That means developing easy-to-use
applications for a variety of contexts, and teaching people how to use
them.  The most sophisticated and cost-efficient networks will be
completely useless if users are unable to understand how to access and
take full advantage of their offerings. <p>

Another dimension of universal service is the recognition that
marketplace economics should not be the sole determinant of the reach
of the information infrastructure. <p>

The President and I have called for positive government action in the
United States to extend the NII to every classroom, library, hospital,
and clinic in the U.S.  by the end of the century. <p>

I want to urge that this conference include in its agenda for action
the commitment to determine how every school and library in every
country can be connected to the Internet, the world's largest computer
network, in order to create a Global Digital Library.  Each library
could maintain a server containing books and journals in electronic
form, along with indexes to help users find other materials.  As more
and more information is stored electronically, this global library
would become more and more useful. <p>

It would allow millions of students, scholars and businesspeople to
find the information they need whether it be in Albania or Ecuador. <p>

Private investment ... competition ... flexibility ... open access ...
universal service. <p>

In addition to urging the delegates of this conference to adopt these
principles as part of the Buenos Aires Declaration, guiding the next
four years of telecommunications development, I assure you that the
U.S. will be discussing in many fora, inside and outside the ITU,
whether these principles might be usefully adopted by all countries. <p>

The commitment of all nations to enforcing regulatory regimes to build
the GII is vital to world development and many global social goals. <p>

But the power of the Global Information Infrastructure will be
diminished if it cannot reach large segments of the world population. <p>

We have heard together Dr. Tarjanne's eloquent speech setting forth the
challenges we face.  As he points out: the 24 countries of the OECD
have only 16 percent of the world's population.  But they account for
70 percent of global telephone mainlines and 90 percent of mobile phone
subscribers. <p>

There are those who say the lack of economic development causes poor
telecommunications.  I believe they have it exactly backwards.   A
primitive telecommunications systems causes poor economic development. <p>

So we cannot be complacent about the disparity between the high and low
income nations, whether in how many phones are available to people or
in whether they have such new technologies as high speed computer
networks or videoconferencing. <p>

The United States delegation is devoted to working with each of you at
this Conference to address the many problems that hinder development. <p>

And there are many.  Financing is a problem in almost every country,
even though telecommunications has proven itself to be an excellent
investment. <p>

Even where telecommunications has been identified as a top development
priority, countries lack trained personnel and up-to-date information. <p>

And in too many parts of the world, political unrest makes it difficult
or impossible to maintain existing infrastructure, let alone lay new
wire or deploy new capacity. <p>

How can we work together to overcome these hurdles?  Let me mention a
few things industrialized countries can do to help. <p>

First, we can use the Global Information Infrastructure for technical
collaboration between industrialized nations and developing countries.
All agencies of the U.S. government are potential sources of
information and knowledge that can be shared with partners across the
globe. <p>

The Global Information Infrastructure can help development agencies
link experts from every nation and enable them to solve common
problems.  For instance, the Pan American Health Organization has
conducted hemisphere-wide teleconferences to present new methods to
diagnose and prevent the spread of AIDS. <p>

Second, multilateral institutions like the World Bank, can help nations
finance the building of telecommunications infrastructure. <p>

Third, the U.S. can help provide the technical know-how needed to
deploy and use these new technologies.  USAID and U.S.  businesses have
helped the U.S.  Telecommunications Training Institute train more than
3500 telecommunications professionals from the developing world,
including many in this room. <p>

In the future, USTTI plans also to help businesspeople, bankers,
farmers, and others from the developing world find ways that computer
networking, wireless technology, satellites, video links, and other
telecommunications technology could improve their effectiveness and
efficiency. <p>

I challenge other nations, the development banks, and the UN system to
create similar training opportunities. <p>

The head of our Peace Corps, Carol Bellamy, intends to use Peace Corps
volunteers both to help deploy telecommunications and computer systems
and to find innovative uses for them.   Here in Argentina, a Peace
Corps volunteer is doing just that. <p>

To join the GII to the effort to protect and preserve the global
environment, our Administration will soon propose using satellite and
personal communication technology to create a global network of
environmental information.  We will propose using the schools and
students of the world to gather and study environmental information on
a daily basis and communicate that data to the world through
television. <p>

But regulatory reform must accompany this technical assistance and
financial aid for it to work.  This requires top-level leadership and
commitment--commitment to foster investment in telecommunications and
commitment to adopt policies that ensure the rapid deployment and
widespread use of the information infrastructure. <p>

I opened by quoting Nathaniel Hawthorne, inspired by  Samuel Morse's
invention of the telegraph. <p>

Morse was also a famous portrait artist in the U.S.-- his portrait of
President James Monroe hangs today in the White House.  While Morse was
working on a portrait of General Lafayette in Washington, his wife, who
lived about 500 kilometers away, grew ill and died.  But it took seven
days for the news to reach him. <p>

In his grief and remorse, he began to wonder if it were possible to
erase barriers of time and space, so that no one would be unable to
reach a loved one in time of need.  Pursuing this thought, he came to
discover how to use electricity to convey messages, and so he invented
the telegraph and, indirectly, the ITU. <p>

The Global Information Infrastructure offers instant communication to
the great human family. <p>

It can provide us the information we need to dramatically improve the
quality of their lives.  By linking clinics and hospitals together, it
will ensure that doctors treating patients have access to the best
possible information on diseases and treatments.  By providing early
warning on natural disasters like volcanic eruptions, tsunamis, or
typhoons, it can save the lives of thousands of people. <p>

By linking villages and towns, it can help people organize and work
together to solve local and regional problems ranging from improving
water supplies to preventing deforestation. <p>

To promote ... to protect ... to preserve freedom and democracy, we
must make telecommunications development an integral part of every
nation's development.  Each link we create strengthens the bonds of
liberty and democracy around the world.  By opening markets to
stimulate the development of the global information infrastructure, we
open lines of communication. <p>

By opening lines of communication, we open minds.  This summer, from my
country cameras will bring the World Cup Championship to well over one
billion people. <p>

To those of you from the 23 visiting countries whose teams are in the
Finals, I wish you luck--although I'll be rooting for the home team. <p>

The Global Information Infrastructure carries implications even more
important than soccer. <p>

It has brought us images of earthquakes in California, of Boris Yeltsin
on a tank in Red Square, of the effects of mortar shells in Sarajevo
and Somalia, of the fall of the Berlin Wall.  It has brought us images
of war and peace, and tragedy and joy, in which we all can share. <p>

There's a Dutch relief worker, Wam Kat, who has been broadcasting an
electronic diary from Zagreb for more than a year and a half on the
Internet, sharing his observations of life in Croatia. <p>

After reading Kat's Croatian diary, people around the world began to
send money for relief efforts.   The result: 25 houses have been
rebuilt in a town destroyed by war. <p>

Governments didn't do this.  People did.  But such events are the hope
of the future. <p>

When I began proposing the NII in the U.S., I said that my hope is that
the United States, born in revolution, can lead the way to this new,
peaceful revolution.  However, I believe we will reach our goal faster
and with greater certainty if we walk down that path together.  As
Antonio Machado, Spanish poet, once said, "Pathwalker, there is no
path, we create the path as we walk." <p>

Let us  build a global community in which the people of neighboring
countries view each other not as potential enemies, but as potential
partners, as members of the same family in the vast, increasingly
interconnected human family. <p>

Let us seize this moment.  Let us work to link the people of the
world.  Let us create this new path as we walk it together. <p>

DATA ENCRYPTION: WHO HOLDS THE KEYS? (Panel) at the Fourth Conference on 
Computers, Freedom and Privacy  <p>

Chicago, Illinois, March 24, 1994 <p>

This is a verbatim transcript of the session on "Data Encryption; Who 
Holds the Keys?" held at the Fourth Conference on Computers, Freedom and 
Privacy in Chicago on March 24, 1994. The transcription was done by an 
independent local transcription agency. Light editing was done by CFP 
volunteers to resolve items the agency could not be expected to have 
knowledge of (for example, "technical" terms like "PGP"). "Did X *really* 
say U?" questions can always be resolved by listening to the audiotape 
available as tape JM414 from Teach'Em, 160 East Illinois St, Chicago, IL 
60611, 1-800-225-3775, for $10 + $1 ($2 outside US) shipping and handling 
+ 8.75% sales tax. <p>

=================================================================  <p>

Welcome to this program from the John
Marshall Law School's fourth conference on computers, freedom and privacy 
entitled, "Cyberspace Superhighways: Access, Ethics &amp; Control", held March 
23rd through the 26th, 1994 at the Chicago Palmer House Hilton.
On this cassette you will hear Data
Encrytion -- who holds the keys? Now to our program.  <p>

BOB SMITH	Willis Ware originally had been
slated to being moderator for this panel and Willis had a problem and 
could not be with us and Robert Ellis Smith has agreed to fill in and use 
his technology background to fill in for Willis. It will take just a 
minute while we disengage from the T.V. hookup and get back to the modern 
overhead projector. 
My name is Bob Smith. I publish
privacy journal and actually I am moderating because Dave Banisar did not 
want to be moderator. We will hear from the three panelists with about 
three ten-minute presentations and then we will open it up to questions.
The three ground rules for this
session: First, there will be no expansions of the metaphor of highways. 
We will not talk about highway metaphors for the next hour. Secondly, we 
will not accept as a defense that this issue is too sensitive or too 
complicated for us to understand and that we have to trust the government. 
And thirdly, a rule that I hope you will make work. If you hear a point of 
jargon or a point of technology that you don't understand, explanation -- 
not policy disputes but if there is something you don't understand feel 
free to raise your hand as a point of order. And if you can say it in ten 
words or less like, I don't understand, we'll get you an answer.
I think Senator Leahy provided a good
primer for cryptography and so I won't bother with that and we'll get 
right into the nuts and bolts of this issue. 
Our speakers are George Davida, who
is with the University of Wisconsin in Milwaukee and has been involved in 
cryptography research for many years and was one of the first academicians 
to feel the heavy hand of government in the 1980's in its effort to try to 
curtail research into cryptography. That appears to be happening again in 
the 1990's so perhaps Professor Davida can tell us something about his 
experiences earlier on that same front.
Our second speaker will be Stuart
Baker, who is General Counsel of the National Security Agency. He was a 
lawyer in private practice in Washington before joining NSA and one of the 
things he promised to do is to tell us exactly what NSA does and is 
because a lot of people don't know. It is different from the National 
Security Council by the way. 
Thirdly, our third speaker will be
David Banisar who is the Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility 
office in Washington. He is trained as a lawyer and has a background in 
computer science and has some strong feelings about the cryptography 
debate.
We will now move to Professor Davida.
PROFESSOR DAVIDA	I would like to talk about two issues
that concern me and I believe a number of people here. By the way, I 
brought some copies of my paper in case you need one today. And if I don't 
have enough you can always write to me at that address. And I am also 
willing to put that on FTP for those of you who are on Internet and you 
can pick up a poster file and print it if you so wish.
As Robert said, in 1978 I had an
interesting experience with NFA. I was doing research at the time in 
cryptograhy and one day I received a secrecy order by mail. It was more or 
less like a postcard telling me that under the penalty of three years in 
jail and $10,000 fine I am to talk to no one about what I had done in that 
paper without reference to any classified material.
At first my graduate student and I
laughed until we found out that it was deadly serious. We talked to the 
Chancelor about it and he said, no way because in Wisconsin there is a 
strong position of academic freedom and we are not allowed actually to 
conduct research that's secret. So we decided to resist the order and 
after a number of conversations between the Chancelor and someone you 
might have heard about recently again, Admiral Bobby Inman, and the then 
Commerce Secretary Juanita Kreps, the order was lifted. But not before 
Admiral Inman tried to convince the Chancelor that he should acquiesce to 
the order and allow us to stay, but I am happy to say that the Chancelor 
said that we could not put up with the order. 
Shortly thereafter a group was formed
by the American Council on Education called Public Cryptography Study 
Group, not to be confused with Public Key Cryptosystems. And it is 
interesting that this group considered model legislation for censorship at 
first. I objected to it rather vigorously and when the press began to get 
involved in covering the meetings, they then approved what they called 
voluntary prior restraint. I again dissented from that report and the 
rest, as they say, is history. 
Many people have asked, "why do you
oppose restaints?" Very simply, that privacy is just too important to 
leave it just to agencies like NSA. I also felt that the ACE 
recommendations were dangerous because they were later going to be looked 
at as some kind of admission by allegedly knowledgeable people that 
cryptography is an evil tool that will only be used by terrorists and drug 
dealers. And it is interesting that Senator Leahy himself refers to the 
struggle of the law enforcement with crimes -- and I assume he is talking 
about drug dealers and what have you. But someone should point out to him 
that they are not using cryptography today so I don't know what the 
struggle is all about. They may be struggling against criminals -- not 
because of cryptography but simply because a crime is just a major 
problem. I would also like to tell them that I don't think that the 
intelligence agencies struggle when it comes to tapping ordinary law 
abiding citizens. They do very well, thank you. 
I also think that the realities are
very different because cryptography is extremely important for two very 
critical applications. Now so far you mostly hear about one of them which 
is privacy. But the other application that also needs privacy work on is 
authenticity, or identification. These are two extremely critical 
applications of cryptography. And what is interesting is that the current 
proposals -- again, you only hear about one of them -- actually constitute 
a double whammy -- because there are two proposals that are being put 
forth today. You only hear about Clipper but what you do not hear about as 
much is the other twin monster that which is the digital signature 
standard. Basically what they are trying to do with this -- with Clipper 
you lack privacy and with DSS you essentially lack the signature, the 
identification schemes -- the two most important operations/applications 
of cryptography. 
So what will essentially happen is
that not only can you invade privacy with digital signatures which will be 
essentially the new way of identifying yourselves to an awful lot of 
systems and executables. They will actually be able to deny your very 
existence if those systems are allowed to be only government issued 
because it will be impossible in the systems of the future not to use 
something like digital identification/ digital authentication schemes 
because there are no other effective means. You all know about the silly 
paper systems we use for identifications, and even high school students 
know how to fake ID's to drink. So we will be moving toward digital 
signatures and if there is only one digital signature it's essentially a 
proposal to have just one government Bic pen. That is what they would like 
us to have. One pen to sign our names with and sign our checks with and 
authenticate ourselves with.
Now again, as I said, privacy is one
application and I have raised a number of objections to it because it has 
been again portrayed as a tool of crime and criminals and drug dealers. 
But they are not the only ones who will be using cryptography and more 
importantly, if we continue this policy they will be the only ones who 
will have good security because we will not have any security as to 
privacy. And as that saying goes "if you outlaw privacy, only outlaws will 
have privacy". It is very strange. I find myself wanting to go and join 
organizations like the NRA all of a sudden. I really do. 
There is also an interesting sort of
deception here going on with this so called escrow system. The problem is 
that, how in the hell can you escrow privacy. Go look at the definition of 
escrow -- it says that something of value held in trust is given back. Can 
you give back privacy? That is impossible. So I think that the very title 
of that is deceptive.  <p>

Then I was amused, as some of you
might have been, with all the stories about bugging to look up a recent 
case of my friend Bobby Inman again, standing in front of television 
cameras saying that William Safire and Senator Dole were conspiring to get 
him with the President. And the question is, where is he getting this kind 
of data? Presumably he must because he spent his whole life, by the way, 
being very careful about what to say. You know, I can't imagine he is 
saying that without having something to back up with what he was claiming. 
So when we talk about bugging, just what do they do with all that data? 
Well, I think you have seen an example of what possibly may have been 
dealt with -- data that is intercepted.
Again, authenticity is another area
that I think people should pay attention to. The second most important 
application of the use of identification, digital signatures for proving 
who you are and yet again they are proposing just one single big pen. I 
think that these two proposals jointly amount to what I consider a digital 
dragnet. Thank you. STUART BAKER:	I have a friend who gives speeches a
lot and he likes to begin all his speeches by referring to country and 
western songs that sum up the theme of his talk. When he talks about 
U.S./Japan trade relations, he always starts out by referring to that 
classic "you got the gold mine, I got the shaft." And I thought about what 
David would have given as the country and western song that I should 
probably sing here and I think in relation to the Clipper Chip it would 
probably be "How can I miss you if you won't go away?"
There is a reason why the Clipper
Chip won't go away and what I thought I would try to do very quickly 
because I only have ten minutes before the lynching begins is talk about 
why Key Escrow hasn't gone away by talking about some of the myths that 
are pretty prevalent about Key Escrow. I am not going to call it Clipper 
because there are a lot of products called Clipper. This is the internal 
name, not something that was used for the public. I don't object to people 
calling it Clipper but there probably are people who have Clipper products 
who would prefer that it not be called that.
Let me see if I can put the first one
up. [OH slide: Myth #1: Key escrow encryption will create a brave new 
world of government, intrusion into the privacy of Americans.] I think 
this is pretty -- probably the classic opening statement about Clipper. 
That this is the beginning of some kind of brave new world in which 
everybody's privacy is at risk in a substantial new way. There is a lot of 
emotion behind that argument but not a lot of fact, because if you ask 
yourself if everybody in the United States used key escrow encryption and 
only key escrow encryption, which is not what the Administration has 
proposed by any means, what would the world look like? Well, the world 
would look like the world we live in today. It would be possible for the 
government to intercept communications subject to a variety of legal rules 
that make it very dangerous to go outside those rules. And, in fact, it 
would be a more private world because other people without authority would 
not be able to intercept and decrypt those communications. That is 
important because, in fact, there is somebody proposing a brave new world 
here and it is the people who want people to go away and to have 
unreadable encryption installed on all of the communications networks in 
the United States. That's a new world and that is a world we don't 
understand. We don't live in it today.
We don't know what it is going to be
like if criminals or terrorists or other people who are hostile to society 
can use that sanctuary to communicate. We don't know what it is like but 
it probably won't be as pleasant in terms of freedom from crime and terror 
as the world we live today, which is not exactly a comforting thought. It 
won't be a world in which the government can do more than they do today. 
So if you ask yourself well, how bad is it today, that's as bad as it can 
get under Clipper.
[OH Slide: Myth #2L Unbreakable
encryption is the key to our future liberty] 
Now the response to that, that you
hear from people, well, yeah but what if the Republicans get elected? What 
if the Administration changes? This is a guarantee. I don't want to have 
to rely on laws and procedures and escrow agents. I don't trust the escrow 
agents, I don't trust the courts, I don't trust the government, I don't 
trust anybody. I want to trust my machine.
Now that is not an uncommon way of
thinking in the parts of this community. I said to somebody once, this is 
the revenge of people who couldn't go to Woodstock because they had too 
much trig homework. It's a kind of romanticism about privacy and the kind 
of, you know, "you won't get my crypto key until you pry it from my dead 
cold fingers" kind of stuff. I have to say, you know, I kind of find it 
endearing. 
The problem with it is that the
beneficiaries of that sort of romanticism are going to be predators. PGP, 
you know, it is out there to protect freedom fighters in Latvia or 
something. But the fact is, the only use that has come to the attention of 
law enforcement agencies is a guy who was using PGP so the police could 
not tell what little boys he had seduced over the net. Now that's what 
people will use this for -- not the only thing people will use it for but 
they will use it for that and by insisting on having a claim to privacy 
that is beyond social regulation we are creating a world in which people 
like that will flourish and be able to do more than they can do today.
[OH Slide: Myth #3: Encryption is the
key to preserving privacy in a digital world] 
I'll move quickly. There is another
argument that I think is less romantic and that is the notion that 
technically, because we are all going to be networked, we are all going to 
be using wireless stuff -- we need encryption for privacy. I am not going 
to say that does not fit but it is a little oversold. Actually, I agreed 
with Professor Davida. Much of the privacy problems that we see in an 
electronic world are not because people are intercepting our 
communications, they're because we are giving it away. But what we don't 
like is that there are people now in a position that collate it all from 
public stuff that we willingly gave up. Well, you know, we gave this 
information to get a loan from one bank and before we know it, you know, 
our ex- spouse's lawyer has got it. That's a problem, but encryption won't 
solve it because you are going to have to give that information up if you 
want the benefit that the bank has. 
Similarly the most important use for
the protection for privacy, protection for data, is authentication -- 
digital signatures as opposed to privacy. I won't say that encrypting data 
for privacy purposes is irrelevant but it is probably not the most 
important way of guaranteeing privacy in an electronic age.
[OH Slide: Myth #4: Key Escrow won't
work. Crooks won't use it if it's voluntary. There must be a secret plan 
to make key escrow encryption mandatory] 
This will be familiar. You shouldn't
over estimate the I.Q. of crooks. When I was first starting out as a 
lawyer I was in Portland, Maine and a guy walked into a downtown bank and 
he said, he handed a note to the teller, it said, "Give me all your money; 
I don't have a gun but I know where I can get one." I'm sure if you sent 
him out to buy encryption he for sure would buy the Clipper Chip.
I think this misstates the problem.
The notion that what the government is trying to do is to put in 
everybody's hands this kind of encryption in the hopes that crooks will be 
fooled into using it I think is to misstate the nature of the concern. The 
concern is not so much what happens today when people go in and buy voice 
scramblers; it is the prospect that in five years or eight years or ten 
years every phone you buy that costs $75 or more will have an encrypt 
button on it that will interoperate with every other phone in the country 
and suddently we will discover that our entire communications network, 
sophisticated as it is, is being used in ways that are profoundly 
anti-social. That's the real concern, I think, that Clipper addresses. If 
we are going to have a standardized form of encryption that is going to 
change the world we should think seriously about what we are going to do 
when it is misused.
[OH Slide: Myth #5: Industry must be
left alone for competitiveness reasons]
Are we interfering with the free
market? Are we affecting the competitiveness of U.S. industry here? First, 
Clipper is an option. It is out there. People can use it. They can make 
it. They can not use it. And they can not make it. It's simply an 
additional option on the market. There may well be people who want this.
I am a lawyer. I think in terms of
who is liable if something goes wrong. And I think that if it's your 
business, and you are thinking about buying encryption and the possibility 
that your employees will misuse it to rip-off your customers, you ask 
yourself, well who is going to be liable if that happens? You might think, 
"Geez, maybe I don't want to be in a position where I can't actually make 
sure the police can come in and check to see if people are misusing this 
encryption where I have reason to believe that they are."
Second, and this is a point that gets
lost a lot: this is a standard for what the government is going to buy 
because nobody in this room has to buy this thing. Now the complaint is 
kind of remarkable from all the stand-on-your-own-two- feet, free-market, 
nobody-tells-me-what-to-do, organizations that we hear from. The fact is, 
that this is just what the government is going to buy, and the people who 
are complaining that they don't want to make it, or don't want to buy it, 
don't have to. What they are really saying is, we would like the 
government to go on testing equipment, telling us what the best stuff is 
so we can then go out and sell it without doing our own research, doing 
our own debugging, our own checks on this technology. I think if you think 
of it from the government's point of view you see why we don't want to do 
that. We probably -- there are very few institutions other than government 
that are willing to devote both the kind of energy and resources that it 
takes to eliminate the last few bugs in encryption software or machinery. 
To go through and find every possible attack and think about how to 
prevent it -- somebody once said, the airport guy talking about encryption 
he said, well, I'll take it if it is invisible, doesn't have any effect on 
the pilot, and adds lift to my airplane. There is an attitude about 
encryption that I think most of you have probably encountered in the 
commercial world is, "Yeah, I want it if it is free." But there is very 
little demonstrated inclination on the part of industry to spend a lot of 
its own money to develop independent encryption. And the fact is that a 
lot of the encryption that is out there today was designed with government 
money, or endorsed by government standards or otherwise supported by 
government fortresses. But if the government is going to create encryption 
and create markets and run the cost down, then we ought to be designing 
and buying encryption that we are willing to see migrate into the private 
sector without destroying the ability of law enforcement to deal with it.
And, I guess, the last point, people
who don't want to sell to the government can make anything they want. 
People are willing to put their own money into designing encryption can do 
it. This is just what the governments fund. AUDIENCE COMMENT:	But you 
can't take it overseas. What
the government buys is (inaudible) technical for overseas. BAKER:	This is 
also something that we hear
a lot about and I'll deal with it quickly. 
[OH Slide: Myth #6: NSA is a spy
agency. It has no business worrying about domestic encryption policy]
Yeah, the NSA does indeed gather
signal intelligence in foreign countries. But we have a second issue. Not 
only do we try to break people's codes but we make codes for the federal 
government. That means we have as a significant mission trying to design 
secure communications here that the government is going to use. And we 
face the very real concern that I described earlier, that if we design 
something and it's good and it's terrific stuff and the price goes down 
because the government has bought a lot of it, then other people are going 
to use it. It may end up becoming the most common encryption in the 
country. If that happens and people like this pedophile out in California 
start using it, we have some responsibility for that and therefore we have 
some responsibility to design and use encryption, that (if it does migrate 
to the private sector) does not put law enforcement out of business.
[OH Slide: Myth #7: The entire
initiative was done in secret. There was no opportunity for industry or 
the public to be heard.]
This is my last one. Again, this was
true, I think or at least it was a reasonable thing to say in April of '93 
when the Clipper Chip first showed up in people's newspapers. But since 
then the Administration has done an enormous amount of public outreach 
listening to a variety of groups -- EFF, CPSR, industry groups, holding 
hearings, organizing task forces to listen to people. It is not that they 
weren't heard -- what I expect people to say is, yes but you still didn't 
listen. We said we don't like it. How come you still did it? 
I think that the answer to that is
you have to ask yourself, what is the alternative that people will 
propose. It is not enough in my view to simply say "Get rid of it. What we 
want is unreadable encryption so that we have a guarantee of privacy 
against some government that hasn't come to our country in 15 years or a 
hundred years or two hundred years, and in the same guarantee that 
criminals and other people who don't have society's interest at heart will 
have a kind of electronic sanctuary." That is not a very satisfying answer 
for people who have to uphold the law as well as try to get the national 
information infrastructure off the ground. 
Thanks.
DAVE BANISAR:	Well, first I'd like to say I'm not
sure what song you were referring to in your country and western 
description, but I think if I had to choose a country and western song it 
would probably be "Take This Job and Shove It." 
Moving onto the high road from now,
I think what we have here is a really fundamental change in the way the 
communication system is being looked at in the future. Currently we have a 
situation where if somebody decides they need a wiretap, which is an issue 
I'll get to in a minute, whether it is useful or not, they go and they do 
an affirmative action. And the communication system is essentially set up 
to communicate. I use it to call.
These two proposals, digital
telephony which we haven't talked about here too much and Clipper, change 
that around. They change it into a fundamental purpose for the 
communication sytem now is going to be, let's make it available for 
surveillance. Essentially, we are designing pretapped telephones and then 
we have to work on the assumption that at only authorized periods will 
they not turn those on. This is a fundamental change. It treats now every 
person as a criminal. We are looking at them going -- well, I think that 
every person in this room is a criminal so I will build the tap into their 
phone. Perhaps next they will be building microphones into everybody's 
desk chairs and only turning them on when they need them. Frankly, in 
reality I don't know if the law enforcement has really made the case for 
wire tapping. Just last week they busted the entire Philadelphia mob. They 
got it by putting a microphone in the lawyer's office. This book here, 
GangLand, it is all about how they got Gotti. They put microphones on the 
street to get Gotti. The FBI comes and they give us the four cases. They 
have the El- Rukh people here in Chicago which I believe was more like a 
scam to get some money out of the Libyan government. They have one 
pedophile, they have a couple of drug dealers and so on and they keep 
doing this.
I don't think they really made the
case. There's only in reality 800 or so wire taps a year. They are only a 
part of the deal. A lot of busts, especially from Mafia, are done with 
inside people with microphones, with a lot of other technologies out 
there. The FBI has spent billions of dollars in the last ten years 
modernizing. They have an amazing computer system now, amazing DNA 
systems, amazing everything. They are not behind the scenes anymore, or 
behind the ball anymore. 
To give you a new example: There were
approximately a couple thousand arrests in 1992 that they say were 
attributable to electronic surveillance and that includes bugs. So it is 
hard to say how many of those were actually wire taps. In 1992 there were 
14 million arrests in the United States. That's an awful lot of arrests 
and an awful small number of those had to do with electronic surveillance. 
Are we willing to revise our entire communication system just for that 
very small number? It is a question that needs to be asked.
Now we have a problem. I wish we
could wave my magic wand here and solve the problem. [Takes out wand] You 
know, this is the magic wand that I can say crypto be gone, or crypto be 
strong. I don't know. It's not working. Oh well. So I have a couple 
solutions or a couple suggestions as they may be.
First is to withdraw the Clipper
proposal. It's a bad idea. Nobody wants it. Of the CNN/Time Magazine poll 
80% of the American public didn't want it. Industry doesn't want it. 
Fifty-thousand people signed our CPSR Clipper petition asking for its 
withdrawal. I haven't seen anybody in the world who wants this thing -- 
well, save two, but I won't mention them.
What should be done is to restart the
process. Back in 1989 NIST was basically ordered to start a new process to 
return to make a new version of DES, or to replace DES with something 
else. And they had a good idea. They wanted it to be an open process. They 
wanted to look around, talk to people like they did back with DES and they 
eventually got that from IBM. They wanted a public algorithm that did both 
security and authenticity. They wanted it available in hardware and 
software. They wanted it to be a good strong standard for everybody. This 
hasn't happened.
You know, withdraw the Clipper
proposal and start the process over. There's lots of people in this room 
even who could come up with something very good but the fact is that we 
have not been allowed to do it. We had, I guess, nine or ten months after 
Clipper came out which had been designed in secret for the last five 
years. In that time nobody has come out and supported the thing and lots 
of people have had better ideas. But they came back a couple weeks ago and 
came out with the exact same proposal with one or two typos replaced. But 
that's about it.
The second thing we need to do is
revise the law. We need to do this since NIST is the agency that is 
supposed to be in charge of this. We should make NIST subject to the same 
kind of rules that every other government agency has to go by. Why should 
NIST have lower standards to develop these crypto things which will affect 
all of our privacy than the FCC does when they hand out a radio license; 
when the Environmental Protection Agency does when they determine how much 
toxic waste we can survive in? The basis for this, for any of you that are 
lawyers in the room, is known as the Administrative Procedures Act. It is 
very well established, it has been around 40 years. Every other government 
agency, every other public government agency uses it already and it works 
well. The things that go under this rulemaking is that it is open. It is 
done in the open. There's no communications behind the scenes. It's all 
done in the public eye. The decision -- when they finally make a decision 
-- is based on the public record. It is not based on something on a 
classified study. And it is appealable. If we think that we've been 
screwed we can appeal.
Finally, as we heard three or four
times today, we need an independent privacy commission. Simply speaking, 
there is nobody in this government -- in the U.S. government -- who is 
responsible for privacy. To look around and say, wait a second, this isn't 
working. I mean, what kind of government do we have that comes up with 
something on surveillance and calls it the "Communication Privacy 
Improvement Act"? What we need is a government agency that can look around 
and give an independent assessment on what's going on. And it can't be 
shunted aside or ignored or anything like that. We have to realize, and I 
apologize for breaking Bob's ground rules, that we're building the 
national information infrastructure without any guard rails. And we need 
to think about it and get back.
Thank you.
BOB SMITH:	Questions, short and sweet. We have
limited time.
CHARLES MARSON	Charles Marson, lawyer of San
Francisco. I would like to ask a question of the General Counsel. I have 
to say, this may be my one lifetime opportunity. 
A lot of the Administration's case
for the Clipper depends on a reliance and a level of comfort with present 
law. We are always told present law covers these things we are not 
extending anything. Present law requires your agency, sir, to apply to the 
foreign intelligence court for a warrant. CBS News issued a report last 
month that said that -- I think it was 4,500 applications had been made to 
that court -- all appointed by Chief Justice Renquist, and 4,500 have been 
granted. That is to say not one has been denied. Now in terms of our 
comfort level with present law will you tell us why it is that we should 
not conclude that this court is nothing but a Fourth Amendment fig leaf 
and that your agency is in fact free to tap anybody it wants. STU BAKER	
There's an interesting element -- I
think you have to understand bureaucratic behavior in part here. CHARLES 
MARSON	My fear is that I do, sir.
[Laughter] A real tap whomever you please. STU BAKER	Let's bear in mind, 
these are all
Article III judges. I actually don't know that the figures you gave are 
right. But these are Article III judges from all over the country. They 
are used to seeing law enforcement wire taps and to reviewing them 
carefully. Their whole life is sticking to the law. CHARLES MARSON	If they 
said yes all the time, who
cares?
STU BAKER	Well, I -- let me offer an
alternative explanation for the record of the courts and the agency in 
terms of FISA applications. And that is this. No one wants to be the first 
general counsel whose application is turned down. Nobody wants to get 
creative about what you can do and what you can't do. And so the effect of 
putting into judicial review is not so much that it is going to lead to 
judges rejecting a lot of stuff as much as it will make the agency make 
sure that before it takes something to the court, it is absolutely 
confident it has a case that it can make, that the judge will accept as 
fitting within the standards set by the statute. It's for the same reason 
that prosecutors don't like to bring cases that they don't think they can 
win. People do not like to try and fail and they consequently are very 
careful about what they put forward. I think that in fact is a more 
creditable explanation of the figures that you gave if they are right than 
the explanation you gave which is that judges don't care what the law is. 
I don't think that's true. SPEAKER	Could we move on to the next
question, thank you.
PHIL ZIMMERMANN	That explanation reminds me of the
Doonsberry cartoon about grade inflation where some students sued for not 
getting an "A" in this course and in the courtroom they said that this 
university gave an "A" to all students. How is it possible that the entire 
graduating class had an "A" average of 4.0 and they said, well, you know, 
it's just a great class. So I guess all those guys that applied for the 
wiretap orders through that judge, all those judges, absolutely all of 
them did everything right. It's sort of a grade inflation for wire tap 
requests. 
One thing that bothers me about this
process of Clipper ....
MODERATOR	Your name please.
PHIL ZIMMERMANN	I'm sorry. I'm Phil Zimmerman. I am
the author of PGP [applause]. I'm sorry, I didn't hear the part about what 
is your name.
It seems to me that this Clipper
process has some kind of secret game plan that the government is following 
through that we only find out about each step of it as it unfolds. I saw 
on the net some news about some representative of the U.S. government 
going -- it might have been from NSA -- talking to people in Europe, other 
countries in Europe, about them getting their own Clipper systems. Well, 
that seems like a public policy thing that we should have been discussing 
openly here before sending somebody over there to quietly do horizontal 
escalation and get this Clipper thing glued in worldwide, planetwide 
before .... thus making it harder to reverse later.
MODERATOR	Could you phrase the question? The
line behind is getting restless.
ZIMMERMANN	Okay, okay.
I think that this kind of secretive
agenda is not being treated like other public policy issues like health 
care and things like that that are openly debated. It's like we are being 
treated like an enemy foreign population to be manipulated cynically. And 
so I would like somebody to respond to that, whoever wants to respond to 
that -- why can't we be treated like ...
MODERATOR	Let's hear the response.
ZIMMERMANN	Okay.
STU BAKER	There isn't a secret plan.
AUDIENCE	(Negative response from the
audience.)
STU BAKER	But, all right, there will be --
we're not the only place that's worried about law enforcement and criminal 
misuse of the communications system. Every country in the world is going 
to be concerned about that -- it is no surprise. Today France says we will 
tell you what you can use, what you can export, what you import. 
Singapore, we've had lots of companies say we're concerned about that.
ZIMMERMANN	Singapore -- it's illegal to not
flush the toilet in Singapore. I didn't make that up, that's true. It's 
possible to construct a society -- a crime-free society -- but who wants 
to live in a society like that? We might be heading toward Singapore. I'm 
glad you said Singapore -- I couldn't have paid you money to say that -- 
I'm glad you said Singapore. STU BAKER	But look, Italy has just banned 
forms
of encryption on the phone system. The significance I think of the 
Singapore example is that we shouldn't expect that as Asians get richer 
they are going to say, oh well, let's adopt American views about privacy. 
What's important about that, I think, is the view that we get from a lot 
of people whose life has been open systems and will have seen that 
standards are the key to new technological advances, believe that if they 
could standarize encryption and sell it everywhere in the world, it would 
sweep the world and whoever had the best product would win. I think that 
reckons without the law enforcement concerns that you will see in every 
country. And you are already beginning to see other countries say we are 
not going to tolerate unreadable encryption of all sorts proliforating 
throughout our communications network. You are going to see more of that. 
Not less. It won't happen here but it will happen in other countries.
AUDIENCE	Yes, worldwide.
MODERATOR	Can we move onto the next question?
And we probably have time for only two more. BLAKE SOBILOFF	My name is 
Blake Sobiloff and I'm
with ACM SIGCAS and I'm trying to figure out some sort of philosophical 
presupposition that you have -- the kind that frames your approach to your 
objections to anti-Clipper individuals. BAKER	Most of the anti-Clipper 
individuals
I really like actually.
BLAKE SOBILOFF	Okay, well, their position. Would it
be fair to characterize your position as one that assumes that a desire 
for an unimpeachable privancy can be fairly well equated with the desire 
to engage in lawless acts? BAKER	No, I think that's completely wrong.
The problem is that guaranteeing privacy to everybody is going to 
guarantee it to some people who will misuse that kind of technological 
sanctuary.
AUDIENCE	(Negative response.)
BAKER	All right, okay. Well, to continue
the poor song metaphor, if anyone is familiar with the Spin Doctors rock 
group. Let me say that you are a fantastic Spin Doctor and I do admire you 
for that but I'll keep my pocket full of kryptonite. Thanks.
QUESTION	Can I make a comment on that.
BAKER	Yes.
QUESTION	I think it is important to say
something about who asked NSA to be the guarantor of privacy. Asking NSA 
to guarantee privacy is sort of like asking Playboy to guard chastity 
belts.
BAKER	I tried to address that briefly. Our
job is in fact to guarantee the privacy of U.S. government communications 
when they're talking about whether to go to war, for example. That's one 
of the things we do and it is one of our two principle missions. We do 
guarantee privacy. Now I understand the reaction but we do have a job to 
create encryption and to make it as good as we possibly can.
AUDIENCE	Not for my privacy.
BAKER	My concern is that what we design is
very likely to be -- to find itself migrating into private sector and if 
we design it in a way that is going to put law enforcement out of business 
we haven't acted responsibly. MODERATOR	Next question.
HERB LIN	My name is Herb Lin. I'm with the
National Academy of Sciences regarding the need for an independent look at 
it. The U.S. Congress has asked the Academy to undertake an independent 
assessment of national cryptography policy. Descriptions of that study are 
out on the giveaway desk. I'll be glad to talk to anybody about it.
MODERATOR	Thank you. We've got one more.
(Unknown)	My name is Barbolin (?) from GRC (?).
I have a question concerning the algorithm that is used in the Clipper 
Chip, Skipjack. That algorithm is not being made public and yet one of the 
very basis of scientific research is that the work should be published and 
then reviewed by the community and approved as the state-of-the-art 
develops. Yet it seems that the NSA reluctant to do that. There is a 
certain amount of conjecture that in fact the algorithm contains a 
deliberately encoded weakness that will allow the NSA, without access to 
the escrow keys, to be able to intercept communication in their mission to 
monitor on- shore and off-shore communications. There's a number of us in 
the scientific community that are greatly concerned that that algorithm is 
not being made public. I would like the counsel from NSA to address that 
with a simple yes or no answer. Is that a problem? And then I would like 
our university professor to comment on his opinion in this matter.
BAKER	I'll answer it yes or no if you'll
tell me exactly the question.
UNKNOWN	Does it or does it not contain a
weakness that allows you to intercept the communications without access to 
the escrow keys.
BAKER	No.
MODERATOR	I'm sorry, that has to be the last
question. We will conclude. I'm sorry, we have to stick to the schedule. 
[Negative audience response.]
We'll conclude with another country song which is .... GEORGE TRUBOW, 
CONF. CHAIR Let me explain to you what our problem is. During the 
reception this room is going to be cleared and turned into the dining room 
for our meal this evening and so the hotel has a schedule; and if you want 
to give up the evening reception and meal we could do that but that's why 
we've got to close out. You want to go for a little longer. Okay, how 
about this for a promise, we'll quit at six (pm) which will give us 
another seven minutes. All right.
PROFESSOR DAVIDA	I will comment just very briefly about
this issue of standards and algorithms.
I've worked for almost 20 years in
organizations like IEEE(?) Computer Society and we have addressed issues 
like standards. It is important to understand what a standard is. 
Standards' purposes are primarily to promote trust in commerce and the 
products that you are actually engaging in, buying or using. DES and other 
encryption standards deviate from that substantially. These are not 
standards that set a boxing or weight standard, or a packaging standard, 
which is what most electronic standards and computer standards tend to be 
like. For example, there is no standard that says you must use the Intel 
8085 or whatever. There is no standard that says you must use a particular 
chip. The standards pertain to buses, number of bytes and what have you. 
DES and other standards like that force us to adopt something which is 
basically monopolistic. It is specific algorithm. So there are some 
fundamental faults with it. But as for trusting algorithm that somebody 
else designed, I stand by my previous comment.
MODERATOR	Thank you.
MIKE GODWIN	I'm Mike Godwin with the Electronic
Frontier Foundation and I have a question, as you can image for the 
General Counsel of the NSA.
You said in myth number four that we can
anticipate -- and in fact NSA did anticipate that these technologies would 
become available in five to ten years. People would go buy telephones, 
have an encryption button and be able to use this technology -- I think I 
am quoting you accurately -- in profoundly anti-social ways. Isn't it true 
that many otherwise acceptable technologies can be used by individuals in 
profoundly anti-social ways including, say the printing press. Isn't it in 
fact true that in a democratic society we make a decision to empower 
individuals knowing upfront and openly that we do so taking risk about 
society. Isn't that in fact the case in this country? BAKER	Yes. And first 
I should say, Mike, I
haven't met you but I've read your stuff and actually, is David Sternlight 
here too?
Sure you take risks and you have to look
at each technology as it comes. Let's take a look at cars. Cars have 
advantages and risks and how do we deal with that. We put license plates 
on every car and everybody has to have a license plate on their car even 
if they think it violates their First Amendment Rights to do it.
MIKE GODWIN	In fact, automobiles are a little bit
different because we do have explicit Constitutional guarantees with 
regard to communications. We have implicit and explicit guarantees as 
regard to privacy and it is a little bit different from driving your Ford.
BAKER	Well, actually there is a Constitutional
right to travel.
MIKE GODWIN	There is a Constitutional right to travel,
that's correct. But we are talking -- it's still a false analogy. This is 
a central right. You know, Hugo Black said that there is a reason for the 
First Amendment to be a First Amendment. BAKER	This is why I never get on 
the net with
you, Mike.
MIKE GODWIN	So I take it you've answered my question.
The reason -- the thing that really troubled me about your comments is 
that you did talk about France and Italy and Singapore and it seems to me 
worth pointing out that the theory of government that we have in this 
country is a little bit different from the theory of government in France, 
Italy and Singapore. (Applause) BAKER	Absolutely. I don't think that we 
will
ever have the same view of government that any of those places have.
MIKE GODWIN	I'm confident.
BAKER	And I think the short answer is, yes, as
each technology comes along we have to evaluate the risks and the rewards 
that come with it and try to figure out the way to get as much good from 
it and as little bad from it. And the response is going to be very 
variable depending on the technology. But you can't set up a principle 
that says we will always do whatever seems like the best technology today 
without regard for the social consequences. We don't do that with guns, we 
don't do that with cars, we don't do that with any kind of technology. 
MODERATOR	Can we go on to another question?
JOHN BRIMACOMBE	Hi, my name is John Brimacombe I'm a
European scientist and user of cryptography. I'd like to go through 
something very quickly here. First, you know, people know about 
cryptography in Europe. We know about all the algorithms. Secondly, you 
know, scientists in Europe don't have brains so defective that we can't 
implement them. And there is going to be a big market for this sort of 
stuff out there in the world. Now, we can do that work, we are doing that 
work, we like doing that work. You are cutting yourselves off. My question 
is, why are you screwing yourselves this way? My worry looking at your 
nice salesmen of your shiny Clipper Chip coming to sell it to all my CEC 
people. I'm worrying that you see this problem. You see yourselves being 
put out of the market by these nice Europeans. They say, okay, let's go 
and screw their market up to a Clipper. MODERATOR	No response?
BAKER	No, I liked the speech.
MATT BLAZE	Matt Blaze from Bell Labs. I have a
question that was originally for Senator Leahy but it could be equally 
well directed to the NSA Counsel. Do you see any risks in terms of risk 
assessment of the Clipper proposal to the fact that the escrow procedures 
exist entirely within the purview of the Executive Branch, the Attorney 
General in particular, and can be changed essentially at will entirely 
within a single branch of government?
BAKER	I think that's a reasonable concern.
One of the interesting things is that we designed it so you decide who you 
trust and that's where the keys go as a society. And we didn't have much 
input into who holds the keys. This is almost a litmus test though. It is 
kind of interesting when you ask, well who do you trust, exactly? And 
often the answer is "Well, just not those guys." And it is much harder 
when you ask the question, "Well who would you trust?" I think Jerry 
Berman was quoted as saying I don't care if it is Mother Theresa and the 
Pope who holds the keys. There certainly are people who feel that way. 
There is a lot of talk about whether, you know, should you have private 
sector entities hold the keys and I have to say that one doesn't ...
MODERATOR	I have to say through the escrow agency.
The procedures are written and under the authority of the -- entirely 
within the Attorney General.
BAKER	The procedures don't change the fact
that we are all governed by laws that are already on the books that make 
it a felony to do stuff without authority. And so the procedures for 
withdrawing key are written down as Executive Branch rules but the legal 
framework for that is set by Congress or by the Fourth Amendment as a 
matter of fact.
EFREM LIPKIN	I'm Efrem Lipkin that works in
community and I guess I'm a fossil from the '60's. My parents had to deal 
with HUAC. I had the utterly surreal experience -- I was in the Civil 
Rights Movement -- I had this surreal experience of apparently a 
government agent tried to plant a copy of the Daily Worker on me. And so 
my question is really for CPSR. Why, I understand why the NSA says we 
don't have to worry about this government. We haven't had any trouble with 
it recently. But why doesn't CPSR point out all of the trouble we have had 
and how the protection -- the privacy protection we want and that we 
historically needed -- is from the government. BANISAR	Well, obviously, 
you haven't been
reading a whole lot of my press releases. We've been pointing out a lot of 
the abuses and problems that have been going on. We have also some deep 
concerns to pour off here a little bit about the escrow procedures. At the 
end of each escrow procedure it mentions that they are not enforceable so 
if they are violated it wouldn't matter because this evidence can't be 
suppressed. Frankly -- I guess somebody asked me today -- Mike Nelson from 
OSTP apparently now is talking about putting the escrow key holders 
outside the government. I frankly think that it wouldn't make a whole 
world of difference whether Mother Theresa and the Pope held the keys then 
if they are not enforceable.
MODERATOR	Thank you, thanks to all the panelists for
coming. We'll conclude with another country song, "I've Enjoyed About as 
Much of This as I Can Stand."
Just a moment please, there is a
related announcement on an equally high note I want to read this to you 
and to my colleague here. To a dedicated advocate, gifted journalist, 
generous friend and true champion of freedom, Robert Ellis Smith. 
publisher, Privancy Journal, in recognition of 20 years in service to the 
cause of privacy protection. With warm regards from friends and colleagues 
in celebrating the 20th year of the publication of this fine journal.
ROBERT ELLIS SMITH	I have a few words I would like to
say. <p>

Clipper Chip Is Your Fried, NSA Contends <p>

NSA Seeks to Dispel Misgivings of Public About Clipper Chip <p>

By Bob Davis <p>

Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal. <p>

FORT MEADE, Md. --- The National Security Agency wants everyone to know
that its new computer-security system will protect individual privacy.
But as the spy agency knows, hardly anyone believes that. <p>

Critics fear the government will use the NSA technology, designed in
secret, to spy on Americans.  The project "is a focal point for the
distrust of government," acknowledges Clinton Brooks, the NSA scientist
who led the so-called Clipper Chip project, in the agency's first
interview on the subject. <p>

The Clinton administration last month adopted the NSA plan for a series
of computer chips that would protect telephones and computers.  Use
of the technology would be voluntary.  Federal agencies would adopt it
first, and public use is expected to spread gradually. <p>

Under the plan, cryptographic "keys" that could unscramble the
communications would be split in two and held separately at the Treasury
Department and the National Institute of Standards and Technology.  That
way, law-enforcement agents could tap the communications by getting court
authorization to obtain the two halves.  The idea is to boost security
but to keep the technology out of the hands of criminals and spies. <p>

The NSA is the world's biggest eaves-dropper.  Equipped with the latest
in super-computers and satellite receivers, it targets communications by
foreign governments.  The agency shuns publicity but agreed to the
interview to explain its role in the Clipper controversy and try to
dispel fears.  Mr. Brooks, a 26-year veteran of the NSA, says the project
began in 1989 and cost more than $2.5 million. <p>

He says the NSA is consumed with what it calls the "equities problem" ---
how to balance privacy rights against the needs of law enforcement,
national security and private industry.  In 1989, he and Raymond Kammer,
deputy director of NIST, began discussions about how to improve computer
security without making it impenetrable to police.  NIST is a Commerce
Department agency with formal responsibility for unclassified computer
security. <p>

Before the interview, Mr. Brooks takes a look around a small cryptographic
museum just outside the NSA's gates.  He stands before an exhibit of
Enigma machines, used by the Germans during World War II to encrypt
messages --- and later broken by Allied intelligence.  Enigma started as
a commercial product; recognizing its military value, the Nazis pulled
it off the market.  "That was the concern we're wrestling with today,"
Mr. Brooks says --- commercial encryption technology becoming so good that
U.S. spy agencies can't crack it. <p>

In 1989, NIST and the NSA put together an eight-person team, split evenly
between the agencies, to quietly work out security concepts.  The team
decided against using a weak encryption code --- "Roman Numeral One is
that it had to be good security," says Mr. Brooks.  And it also rejected
a so-called trapdoor approach, in which the computer code would be
designed so it would have a weak spot --- a trapdoor --- that federal
agencies could enter via computer to tap the communications.  Someone else
could discover the trapdoor, they decided. <p>

The team settled on a system with a powerful encryption formula, called
an algorithm, and encryption keys that would be held by outsiders.  Law-
enforcement agencies could get copes of the keys when they needed to bug
the conversations.  The toughest decision, both Mr. Brooks and Mr. Kammer
say, was to keep the algorithm, dubbed the Skipjack, secret.  That meant
the public wouldn't know for sure whether the NSA had inserted a trapdoor
or some other eavesdropping device. <p>

"It would defeat the purpose [of the project] if we gave the knowledge
of how the algorithm worked" to the public, says the 56-year-old Mr.
Brooks.  "It was going to have to be kept classified."  Otherwise, he
explains, engineers could use the algorithm to design computer-security
systems that the government's encryption keys couldn't unlock. <p>

By 1990, he says, as many as 30 NSA "cryptomathematicians" and other
employees were working to perfect the algorithm and other features.  A
year later, the NSA launched what it called the Capstone Project to build
the algorithm into a computer chip.  The NSA contracted with Mykotronx
Inc., a small company in Torrance, Calif., to do much of the development.
By September 1992, the NSA was confident the system would work. <p>

None too early for the NSA.  Earlier that year, Mr. Brooks says, American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. informed the NSA that it wanted to sell a
phone using a popular encryption technology to scramble conversations.
The NSA balked.  "We said it probably wouldn't get an export license
from this country," Mr. Brooks says.  Instead, AT&amp;T was told of the
Capstone work and agreed to use the technology if it became a federal
standard and was exportable, he says.  The NSA then took some of the
functions of the Capstone chip and tailored it to phone equipment, calling
the resulting product the Clipper Chip.  For computers, Capstone was
encased on a computer card that became known as Tessera. <p>

The the Bush administration, enmeshed in a re-election bid, never pushed
Capstone.  So shortly after the election, National-security heavyweights
importuned the Clinton transition team to move quickly on Capstone.  Just
weeks after the inauguration, the new administration's national-security
team was debating the NSA proposal and in April announced to the public
that it would adopt the scheme. <p>

Last month, the administration gave the final go-ahead --- despite
withering criticism from industry.  Vice President Gore called encryption
a "law and order issue."  NIST's Mr. Kammer says the new administration
was also trying to line up backing among national-security officials to
liberalize export controls on computer equipment and other high-tech
gear. <p>

The high-tech industry was stunned at the decision.  David Peyton, vice
president of the Information Technology Association of America, a trade
group of computer companies, says the scheme will dangerously centralize
power in the federal government and will limit exports.  James Bidzos,
president of a computer-security firm, RSA Data Security Inc., goes
further.  He posted a letter on the Internet computer network arguing
that Clipper may be the "visible portion of a large-scale covert
operation on U.S. soil by NSA." <p>

Nonsense, responds Mr. Brooks, who says he is distressed by the
"emotionalism" of the arguments.  "The only reason we're involved is
that we have the best cryptomathematicians in the country." <p>

LITERARY FREEWARE:  NOT FOR COMMERCIAL USE <p>

Remarks at Computers, Freedom and Privacy Conference IV
 Chicago, Mar 26, 1994 <p>

I've been asked to explain why I don't worry much about the
 topics of privacy threat raised by this panel.  And I don't.  One reason
 is that these scenarios seem to assume that there will be large,
 monolithic bureaucracies (of whatever character, political or
 economic)  that are capable of harnessing computers for one-way
 surveillance of an unsuspecting populace.  I've come to feel that
 computation just doesn't work that way.  Being afraid of monolithic
 organizations especially when they have computers, is like being
 afraid of really big gorillas especially when they are on fire. <p>

The threat simply doesn't concur with my historical
 experience.  None of the large organizations of my youth that
 compelled my fear and uneasy respect have prospered.  Let me just
 roll off a few acronyms here.  CCCP.  KGB.  IBM.  GM.  AEC.  SAC. <p>

It was recently revealed that the CIA has been of actual
 negative worth -- literally worse than useless -- to American
 national security.  They were in the pockets of the KGB during our
 death struggle with the Soviet Union -- and yet we still won.
 Japanese zaibatsus -- Japan Inc. -- the corporate monoliths of Japan
 -- how much hype have we heard about that lately?   I admit that
 AT&amp;T has prospered, sort of -- if you don't count the fact that
 they've hollowed themselves out by firing a huge percentage of their
 personnel. <p>

Suppose that, say, Equifax, turned into an outright fascist
 organization and stated abusing privacy in every way they could.
 How could they keep that a secret?  Realistically, given current
 employment practices in the Western economies, what kind of
 loyalty could they command among their own personnel?  The low
 level temps have no health insurance and no job security; the high
 level people are ready to grab their golden parachutes and bail at any
 time.  Where is the fanatically loyal army of gray flannel
 organization men who will swear lifelong allegiance to this
 organization, or *any* organization in this country with the possible
 exception of the Mafia? <p>

I feel that the real threat to our society isn't because people
 are being surveilled but because people are being deliberately
 ignored.  People drop through the safety nets.  People stumble
 through the streets of every city in this country absolutely wrapped
 in the grip of demons, groping at passersby for a moment's attention
 and pity and not getting it.  In parts of the Third World people are
 routinely disappeared, not because of high-tech computer
 surveillance but for the most trivial and insane reasons -- because
 they wear glasses, because they were seen reading a book -- and if
 they survive, it's because of the thin thread of surveillance carried
 out by Amnesty International. <p>

There may be securicams running 24 hours a day all around us,
 but mechanical surveillance is not the same as people actually
 getting attention or care.  Sure, rich people, like most of us here, are
 gonna get plenty of attention, probably too much, a poisonous
 amount, but in the meantime life has become so cheap in this society
 that we let people stagger around right in front of us exhaling
 tuberculosis without treatment.  It's not so much information haves
 and have-nots and watch and watch-nots. <p>

I wish I could speak at greater length more directly to the
 topic of this panel.  But since I'm the last guy to officially speak at
 CFP IV, I want the seize the chance to grandstand and do a kind of
 pontifical summation of the event.  And get some irrepressible
 feelings off my chest. <p>

What am I going to remember from CFP IV?  I'm going to
 remember the Chief Counsel of NSA and his impassioned insistence
 that key escrow cryptography represents normality and the status
 quo, and that unlicensed hard cryptography is a rash and radical leap
 into unplumbed depths of lawlessness.  He made a literary reference
 to BRAVE NEW WORLD.  What he said in so many words was, "We're
 not the Brave New World, Clipper's opponents are the Brave New
 World." <p>

And I believe he meant that.  As a professional science fiction
 writer I remember being immediately struck by the deep conviction
 that there was plenty of Brave New World to go around. <p>

I've been to all four CFPs, and in my opinion this is the darkest
 one by far.  I hear ancestral voices prophesying war.  All previous
 CFPs had a weird kind of camaraderie about them.  People from the
 most disparate groups found something useful to tell each other.
 But now that America's premiere spookocracy has arrived on stage
 and spoken up, I think the CFP community has finally found a group of
 outsiders that it cannot metabolize.  The trenchworks are going up
 and I see nothing but confrontation ahead. <p>

Senator Leahy at least had the elementary good sense to
 backpedal and temporize, as any politician would when he saw the
 white-hot volcano of technological advance in the direct path of a
 Cold War glacier that has previously crushed everything in its way. <p>

But that unlucky flak-catcher the White House sent down here
 -- that guy was mousetrapped, basically.  That was a debacle!  Who
 was briefing that guy?  Are they utterly unaware?  How on earth
 could they miss the fact that Clipper and Digital Telephony are
 violently detested by every element in this community -- with the
 possible exception of one brave little math professor this high?
 Don't they get it that everybody from Rush Limbaugh to Timothy
 Leary despises this initiative?  Don't they read newspapers?   The
 Wall Street Journal, The New York Times?  I won't even ask if they
 read their email. <p>

That was bad politics.  But that was nothing compared to the
 presentation by the gentleman from the NSA.  If I can do it without
 losing my temper, I want to talk to you a little bit about how
 radically unsatisfactory that was. <p>

I've been waiting a long time for somebody from Fort Meade to
 come to the aid of Dorothy Denning in Professor Denning's heroic and
 heartbreaking solo struggle against twelve million other people with
 email addresses.  And I listened very carefully and I took notes and I
 swear to God I even applauded at the end. <p>

He had seven points to make, four of which were disingenuous,
 two were half-truths, and the other was the actual core of the
 problem. <p>

Let me blow away some of the smoke and mirrors first, more
 for my own satisfaction than because it's going to enlighten you
 people any.  With your indulgence. <p>

First, the kidporn thing.  I am sick and tired of hearing this
 specious blackwash.  Are American citizens really so neurotically
 uptight about deviant sexual behavior that we will allow our entire
 information infrastructure to be dictated by the existence of
 pedophiles?  Are pedophiles that precious and important to us?  Do
 the NSA and the FBI really believe that they can hide the structure of
 a telephone switch under a layer of camouflage called child
 pornography?   Are we supposed to flinch so violently at the specter
 of child abuse that we somehow miss the fact that you've installed a
 Sony Walkman jack in our phones? <p>

Look, there were pedophiles before NII and there will be
 pedophiles long after NII is just another dead acronym.  Pedophiles
 don't jump out of BBSes like jacks in the box.  You want to impress
 me with your deep concern for children?  This is Chicago!  Go down
 to the Projects and rescue some children from being terrorized and
 recruited by crack gangs who wouldn't know a modem if it bit them
 on the ass!  Stop pornkidding us around!  Just knock it off with that
 crap, you're embarrassing yourselves. <p>

But back to the speech by Mr. Baker of the NSA.  Was it just me,
 ladies and gentlemen, or did anyone else catch that tone of truly
 intolerable arrogance?  Did they guy have to make the remark about
 our missing Woodstock because we were busy with our
 trigonometry?  Do spook mathematicians permanently cooped up
 inside Fort Meade consider that a funny remark?  I'd like to make an
 even more amusing observation -- that I've seen scarier secret
 police agencies than his completely destroyed by a Czech hippie
 playwright with a manual typewriter. <p>

Is the NSA unaware that the current President of the United
 States once had a big bushel-basket-full of hair?  What does he
 expect from the computer community?  Normality?  Sorry pal, we're
 fresh out!   Who is it, exactly, that the NSA considers a level-headed
 sober sort, someone to sit down with and talk to seriously?  Jobs?
 Wozniak?  Gates?  Sculley?  Perot -- I hope to God it's not Perot.
 Bob Allen -- okay, maybe Bob Allen, that brownshoe guy from AT&amp;T.
 Bob Allen seems to think that Clipper is a swell idea, at least he's
 somehow willing to merchandise it.  But Christ, Bob Allen just gave
 eight zillion dollars to a guy whose idea of a good time is Microsoft
 Windows for Spaceships! <p>

When is the NSA going to realize that Kapor and his people and
 Rotenberg and his people and the rest of the people here are as good
 as people get in this milieu?  Yes they are weird people, and yes they
 have weird friends (and I'm one of them), but there isn't any
 normality left for anybody in this society, and when it comes to
 computers, when the going got weird the weird turned pro!  The
 status quo is *over!*  Wake up to it!  Get used to it! <p>

Where in hell does a crowd of spooks from Fort Meade get off
 playing "responsible adults" in this situation?  This is a laugh and a
 half!  Bobby Ray Inman, the legendary NSA leader, made a stab at
 computer entrepreneurism and rapidly went down for the third time.
 Then he got out of the shadows of espionage and into the bright
 lights of actual public service and immediately started gabbling like
 a daylight-stricken vampire.  Is this the kind of responsive public
 official we're expected to blindly trust with the insides of our
 phones and computers?  Who made him God? <p>

You know, it's a difficult confession for a practiced cynic like
 me to make, but I actually trust EFF people.  I do; I trust them;
 there, I've said it.   But I wouldn't trust Bobby Ray Inman to go down
 to the corner store for a pack of cigarettes. <p>

You know, I like FBI people.  I even kind of trust them, sort of,
 kind of, a little bit.  I'm sorry that they didn't catch Kevin Mitnick
 here.  I'm even sorry that they didn't manage to apprehend Robert
 Steele, who is about one hundred times as smart as Mitnick and ten
 thousand times as dangerous.   But FBI people, I think your idea of
 Digital Telephony is a scarcely mitigated disaster, and I'll tell you
 why. <p>

Because you're going to be filling out your paperwork in
 quintuplicate to get a tap, just like you always do, because you don't
 have your own pet court like the NSA does.  And for you, it probably
 is going to seem pretty much like the status quo used to be.  But in
 the meantime, you will have armed the enemies of the United States
 around the world with a terrible weapon.  Not your court-ordered,
 civilized Digital Telephony -- their raw and tyrannical Digital
 Telephony. <p>

You're gonna be using it to round up wiseguys in streetgangs,
 and people like Saddam Hussein are gonna be using it to round up
 democratic activists and national minorities.  You're going to
 strengthen the hand of despotism around the world, and then you're
 going to have to deal with the hordes of state-supported
 truckbombers these rogue governments are sending our way after
 annihilating their own internal opposition by using your tools.  You
 want us to put an axe in your hand and you're promising to hit us
 with only the flat side of it, but the Chinese don't see it that way;
 they're already licensing fax machines and they're gonna need a lot
 of new hardware to gear up for Tiananmen II. <p>

I've talked a long time, but I want to finish by saying
 something about the NSA guy's one real and actual argument.  The
 terrors of the Brave New World of free individual encryption.  When
 he called encryption enthusiasts "romantic" he was dead-on, and
 when he said the results of spreading encryption were unpredictable
 and dangerous he was also dead-on, because people, encryption is not
 our friend.  Encryption is a mathematical technique, and it has about
 as much concern for our human well-being as the fact that seventeen
 times seventeen equals two hundred and eighty-nine.  It does, but
 that doesn't make us sleep any safer in our beds. <p>

Encrypted networks worry the hell out of me and they have
 since the mid 1980s.  The effects are very scary and very
 unpredictable and could be very destabilizing.  But even the Four
 Horsemen of Kidporn, Dope Dealers, Mafia and Terrorists don't worry
 me as much as totalitarian governments.  It's been a long century,
 and we've had enough of them. <p>

Our battle this century against totalitarianism has left
 terrible scars all over our body politic and the threat these people
 pose to us is entirely and utterly predictable.   You can say that the
 devil we know is better than the devil we don't, but the devils we
 knew were ready to commit genocide, litter the earth with dead, and
 blow up the world.  How much worse can that get?  Let's not build
 chips and wiring for our police and spies when only their police and
 spies can reap the full benefit of them. <p>

But I don't expect my arguments to persuade anyone in the NSA.
 If you're NSA and I do somehow convince you, by some fluke, then I
 urge you to look at your conscience -- I know you have one -- and
 take the word to your superiors and if they don't agree with you --
 *resign.*  Leave the Agency.  Resign now, and if I'm right about
 what's coming down the line, you'll be glad you didn't wait till later. <p>

But even though I have a good line of gab, I don't expect to
 actually argue people out of their livelihood.  That's notoriously
 difficult. <p>

So CFP people, you have a fight on your hands.  I'm sorry that a
 community this young should have to face a fight this savage, for
 such terribly high stakes, so soon.   But what the heck;  you're
 always bragging about how clever you are; here's your chance to
 prove to your fellow citizens that you're more than a crowd of net-
 nattering MENSA dilettantes.  In cyberspace one year is like seven
 dog years, and on the Internet nobody knows you're a dog, so I figure
 that makes you CFP people twenty-eight years old.   And people, for
 the sake of our society and our children you had better learn to act
 your age. <p>

Good luck.  Good luck to you.  For what it's worth, I think you're
 some of the best and brightest our society has to offer.  Things look
 dark but I feel hopeful.  See you next year in San Francisco. <p>

EFF Summary of Public Interest Summit <p>

EFF SUMMARY <p>

PUBLIC INTEREST SUMMIT: SHAPING THE NATIONAL INFORMATION INFRASTRUCTURE <p>

Hyatt Regency Hotel in Washington, DC
MARCH 29, 1994 <p>

OPENING REMARKS <p>

Welcoming remarks were delivered by Andrew Blau from the Benton Foundation,
who expressed gratitude to the program sponsors and planning committee.
Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown delivered pre-taped opening remarks on
video, because he was in Russia at the time of the conference.  Secretary
Brown, who chairs the Information Infrastructure Task Force (IITF),
restated the Administration's commitment to universal service, emphasizing
that no one should be left standing on the side of the road. <p>

PUBLIC INTEREST SUMMIT PANELS <p>

DELIVERING THE GOODS: MEETING PUBLIC NEEDS? <p>

Moderator: V. Lane Rawlins, President, Memphis State University
C. Everett Koop, Senior Scholar, Koop Institute
David Lytel, White House Office of Science and Technology
Jean Armour Polly, NY State Research and Education Network
Anthony Riddle, Chair, Alliance for Community Media
Connie Stout, Director, Texas Education Network
Patricia Waak, National Audubon Society <p>

This panel discussed the ways in which the National Information
Infrastructure (NII) can improve education, health care, and the
environment by enhancing communication and decisionmaking within
communities, as well as within state, national, and international
boundaries.  There was strong consensus on the panel and from the floor
that teaching people to use the tools is as important as building the
tools.  Choosing the right regulatory model is a difficult issue, but David
Lytel said that the Clinton Administration is committed to making sure that
citizens can be information producers, as well as information consumers.
He stated that the challenge is to make sure that the NII becomes more than
just a large pipe for television reruns and movies, home shopping,
electronic games, and gambling.  The architecture of the NII must guarantee
that needs outside the commercial marketplace, including cultural and other
public benefits, are met. <p>

A LINK INTO EVERY HOME: HOW, WHAT, AND WHEN? <p>

Moderator: Allen Hammond, Director, Communications Media Center, NY Law School
Ron Binz, Director, Colorado Office of Consumer Counsel
Mark Cooper, Director of Research, Consumer Federation of America
Deborah Kaplan, Vice President, World Institute on Disability
Robert Larson, President/General Manager, WTVS-Detroit
Michael Nelson, White House Office of Science and Technology
Andrew J. Schwartzman, Executive Director, Media Access Project <p>

The panel explored the challenges in applying the concept of universal
service to the NII to ensure access for everyone.  The panelists discussed
universal service funding mechanisms, the role of government in supporting
a diversity of voices, and the need for public interest advocacy before the
Federal Communications Commission.  Mike Nelson said that the
Administration's model for the NII is the Internet, and its goals for
universal service are to provide subsidies to enable open access for as
many people as possible, to adopt pro-competitive policies, to require
nondiscriminatory prices, to prohibit network providers from controlling
information, and to enhance interoperability and interconnection
requirements. <p>

Addressing the difference between the common carriage regime for telephone
companies and the market/consumer model for the cable industry, Andrew
Schwartzman argued for the common carriage model instead of the cable
model, because the cable model is passive and connotes people receiving
only limited services such as video-on-demand and home shopping.  Common
carriage would help NII users to be speakers as well as listeners, and
producers as well as consumers.  Ron Binz offered the phrase "Information
Superhypeway" and cautioned that a fully competitive telecommunications
industry is not right around the corner.  The key decision, according to
Binz, is whether to rely on taxing voice communications service to fund the
NII.  Binz also characterized as "industry propaganda" the view that
subsidies should be provided to enable access for as many people as
possible.  Mark Cooper challenged the widely cited statistic that 93% of
the population enjoys telephone service.  Instead, he stated that the 7%
"unsolution" is really closer to 30%, which includes individuals with
disabilities and low incomes.  He argued that those who cannot afford
access to the NII will be assured access if everyone who can afford to use
the NII is required to pay for it. <p>

Deborah Kaplan took the discussion beyond the issue of funding to the issue
of access.  She argued that the 7% of the population that is underserved is
a product of the market model.  There is no one-size-fits-all solution, and
policy input from low-income people is essential.  She raised the concern
that access to the NII for disabled individuals may be uniquely difficult,
especially if the NII architecture is modeled on voice-based telephone
service.  Schwartzman emphasized the First Amendment dimension of universal
service, including artistic speech, and the need to protect against any
form of censorship.  Bob Larson explained how public broadcasting's role in
promoting local service responsibilities and public service duties is a
model for what the NII can do to marshall local resources.  The NII could
augment public broadcasting's efforts aimed at reducing violence and
improving the well-being of young people. <p>

SPEECH BY VICE PRESIDENT AL GORE <p>

The Vice President was introduced by Peter Goldmark, President of The
Rockefeller Foundation, who emphasized the historical role of the NII in
charting the future of democracy.  Vice President Gore stated the
Administration's commitment to wiring every classroom, clinic, and library
in the United States to the NII within the next five years.  Every person
will benefit from the NII.  However, while we already have the technology,
we do not yet have the infrastructure.  The National Telecommunication and
Information Adminstration in the Department of Commerce recently announced
the availability of funding for some of the aspects of the NII and already
have received 3,500 inquiries. <p>

Reforming telecommunications law is essential.  Universal service means
lower prices for everyone.  Open access means receiving and sending
information across the NII.  The future will look like the Internet if we
make sure the NII is open and accessible like the personal computer. <p>

Networked communities are consistent with our democratic form of government
and distinguish it from  communism and fascism.  We need to increase access
to government information to enhance community decisionmaking.  We are
increasing the availability of government information.  SeniorNet is
providing services to senior citizens.  The Environmental Protection
Agency's toxics release inventory is empowering citizens to ameliorate
environmental hazards in their communities.  HUD has begun to put
information about fair housing and fair lending on the net.  We can empower
our representative democracy.  People closest to the problems are the
smartest about the solutions. <p>

BUILDING COMMUNITIES AND THE ECONOMY <p>

Moderator: Linda Tarr-Whelan, President and Exec. Dir., Center for Policy
Alternatives
Morton Bahr, President, Communications Workers of America
Cushing Dolbeare, President, Low-Income Housing Coalition
Thomas Kalil, National Economic Council for Science and Technology
Anthony Pharr, Counsel, Office of Communication, United Church of Christ
Diana Roose, Research Director, National Association of Working Women
Randy Ross, Vice President, American Indian Telecommunications <p>

After brief introductory statements, the panelists discussed what the NII
means for generating jobs and economic benefits.  The goal is to use the
NII to create better, high wage jobs.  Development of information policy
must make sure that the NII is a tool for community planning.
Telecommuting will have an impact on the national economy by enabling
people to live and work anywhere, including in other countries.  We should
use the technology that exists now in order to do the kind of planning
needed to make sure the new technologies produce advances in our national
economy. <p>

MAKING DEMOCRACY WORK <p>

Moderator:  Sonia Jarvis, Exec. Dir., National Coalition for Black Voter
Participation
Brian Banks, Policy Research Action Group
Jim Butler, Director, AARP/VOTE, American Association of Retired Persons
Mitchell Kapor, Chair, Electronic Frontier Foundation
Sally Katzen, Chair, Information Policy Committee, IITF
Ralph Nader, Center for the Study of Responsive Law
Nadine Strossen, ACLU <p>

This panel addressed whether the NII can support increased civic
participation, free speech and assembly, and privacy.  Brian Banks stressed
the NII's ability to bring about a reconfiguration of hierarchies; enhanced
citizen participation in the decision making process would be the most
fundamental change.  Jim Butler revisited the NII's potential for community
development, educational opportunity, and access to government databases.
Mitchell Kapor focused on the potential for achieving the Jeffersonian
principles of individual liberty and decentralization.  The Internet has
enormous democratic potential, but it is not easy to use.  The emphasis
should be on the Internet and interactivity, not on the Information
Superhighway and Hollywood reruns. Everyone should become hands-on, start
learning and interacting, and ask for help when needed.  The networks
should be easy to use, but we cannot wait for a national handout. <p>

Sally Katzen stressed the goal of economic sustainable development.  The
government should not be solely responsible for the nation's information
sytems.  The toxics release inventory is a model that has worked well.
Ralph Nader, who still uses a manual Underwood typewriter, questioned what
all this new technology will do about such problems as violence in the
schools.  Will it just put more people into the Office of Management and
Budget and lead to mega-billion dollar overselling of unused software?
While there needs to be a window on government databases, there is not
reason for them to be overprivatized or overmonopolized.  Educational
efforts, like liberal arts-type courses, could motivate people to
participate.  Nadine Strossen argued that the common carriage model is
important to ensure universal access--but security and privacy are equally
important.  We have to make certain that there are no censorial controls
over content.  All of us must lobby for privacy protection -- and we must
fight the clipper chip. <p>

 P. R. China Computer Security Rules (long)  [a known contributor who wishes to remain anonymous -- from risks pn] <p>

from: [a known contributor who wishes to remain anonymous ] <p>

connection to the Internet (CHINANET; sub CHINANET to
LISTSERV@TAMVM1.TAMU.EDU). <p>

The Chinese have named their new project to connect China to the Internet the
"Golden Bridge" project.  The following document purports to be the newly
developed "PRC Regulations on Safeguarding Computer Information Systems."  It
seems quite appropriate for RISKS. <p>

As you read this, keep in mind that 1) in China accused persons are guilty
until proven innocent; 2) laws referred to in the document as ones applying in
certain circumstances are often harsh, subject to change without notice, and
so vaguely worded as to make easy the prosecutor's job, not of proving guilt
(not necessary), but of arguing why the penalty should be maximized; 3) the
"Public Security" laws referred to are the same laws that stipulate that the
families of serious offenders will be billed for the single bullet used in
judgement; 4) certain concepts (virus, special security products) are either
poorly defined or all inclusive; 5) in China when there is doubt as to the
legality of any particular act, illegality is assumed (this is important not
only in court, but also in normal life, where people tend to be more
conservative in part because of it.) <p>

As we welcome this brave new domain into our net.universe, it will be
interesting, and perhaps surprising at times, to see how another set of
explorers on the electronic frontier are approaching the flow of information.
Golden Bridge, indeed.  As read, sending email without filing a customs
declaration, or accepting a shareware registration for an anti- virus product
could both be construed as being illegal.  There's a lot of room for
improvement here, imho. <p>

Mac PGP2.3a V1.1 Readme
                              ----------------------- <p>

Why two version numbers? <p>

This update mainly consists of changes to the human interface (i. e. to the =
Mac-
specific part). Since I expect that this part will be developed more or less
independantly from the encryption part, I use two version numbers:
This is the Mac implementation V1.1 of PGP 2.3a. <p>

What's different? <p>

Some minor bugs have been fixed, but you probably didn't have any problems
with them.
The menus have been adapted to look more like a typical Mac application. As
you have
already seen, there are now two versions of MacPGP: An Englisch version and
a German
translation. For more information about the translated version read the Germ=
and
readme. <p>

The most important change (in my opinion) is that MacPGP is now AppleScript
aware.
You can invoke all important actions (like encrypt, decrypt, sign etc.) by
AppleScript commands. The preferences can be changed online only. <p>

The following text assumes you are already familiar with AppleScript (otherw=
ise
read the AppleScript User's Manual) and with PGP (Please DO read the stuff i=
n
the documentation folder)! <p>

MacPGP V1.1 supports the Required Suite and a MacPGP Suite. You can use its
commands
via AppleScript or directly to communicate with other programs. E. g. the
"Mausefalle"
(an offline-reader for the German BBS-Network "MausNet") uses them to
decode incoming
mail automatically and to encrypt your own mail before sending it. If you
include
PGP support in your own program, I'd like you to give me a quick note (just =
for
curiosity), my EMail address is: "Christoph_Pagalies@HH2.maus.de". <p>

The following is a rough description of the supported AppleScript commands. =
You
can get a nicely formatted list by the "Open Dictionary" command in the
AppleScript
editor. <p>

Required Suite
<hr> <p>

open: =D6ffnet eine Reihe von Objekten
print: Druckt Objekte
quit: Beendet das Programm
run: Wird beim Programmstart automatisch gesendet <p>

MacPGP Suite
<hr> <p>

encrypt: Eine Datei codieren
        encrypt  alias  -- die zu codierende Datei
                to  string  -- Der Empf=E4nger
                [user id  string]  -- Eigener Name
                [signature  separated/included/omitted]
                [reading  MacBinary/plaintext/normal]
                [writing  binary/asciified] <p>

Empf=E4nger oder Absenderangaben m=FCssen mit dem Namen im Schl=FCsselbund
=FCbereinstimmen
oder dem Anfang des Namens entsprechen. Also kann man
"Gabriele Mustermann &lt;gabi@test.aga.de&gt;" als "Gabriele" oder "Gab"
adressieren, aber
nicht als "gabi", da der Anfang nicht =FCbereinstimmt. <p>

Beim Codieren kann eine Unterschrift angelegt werden, die entweder hinten
angeh=E4ngt
wird (signature included) oder in eine getrennte Datei geschrieben wird
(signature separated). Bei "omitted" wird keine Unterschrift angelegt. <p>

Der "reading" Parameter gibt die Art der Quelldatei an. Handelt es sich um
ASCII-
Texte, gibt man "reading plaintext" an, bei Bin=E4rdateien "reading normal".=
 Wenn
eine Macintosh-Datei =FCbertragen werden soll, die einen Data- und einen Res=
ource-
=46ork enth=E4lt, ist "reading MacBinary" anzugeben. <p>

"writing binary" bedeutet eine Ausgabe als kompakte Bin=E4rdatei, bei "ascii=
fied"
wird ein 7-Bit-ASCII-Text erzeugt, der =FCber EMail verschickt werden kann. <p>

sign: Eine Datei unterschreiben
        sign  alias  -- Die zu unterschreibende Datei
                [user id  string]  -- Eigener Name
                [signature  separated/included/clear]
                [reading  MacBinary/plaintext/normal]
                [writing  binary/asciified] <p>

Neu ist hier der "signature clear" Parameter: Die Unterschrift wird eingef=
=FCgt
(wie bei "included"), der eigentliche Nachrichtentext wird im Klartext
ausgegeben.
Der Text kann dann gelesen werden, ohne ihn erst mit PGP decodieren zu m=FCs=
sen.
Allerdings kann er evtl. auf dem =DCbertragungsweg umformatiert werden,
wodurch die
Unterschrift dann nicht mehr stimmt. <p>

execute: Eine Befehlszeile ausf=FChren.
        execute  string  -- Die Befehlszeile <p>

Hier kann ein DOS-Befehl =FCbergeben werden.
Statt "encrypt file 'Test' to 'Gabriele' writing asciified" kann man auch
"execute 'pgp -ea Test Gabriele'" schreiben. Hiermit lassen sich seltene
Befehle aufrufen, die keine zugeordneten AppleScript-Befehle haben, z. B.
"Unterschrift l=F6schen". <p>

decrypt: Datei decodieren, unterschrift pr=FCfen o. =E4.
        decrypt  alias
                [toScreen  boolean]
                [to  file specification]  -- Decodierte Datei speichern als
        Result:   string <p>

"toScreen" gibt den decodierten Text auf dem Bildschirm aus. Sonst wird er
in der
angegebenen Datei gespeichert. <p>

Bei unterschriebenen Dateien wird der Name des Unterzeichners zur=FCckgegebe=
n. <p>

add: Schl=FCssel zum Schl=FCsselbund hinzuf=FCgen
        add  alias  -- Die Datei mit dem Schl=FCssel
                [key ring  file specification]  -- Das Schl=FCsselbund <p>

extract: Schl=FCssel aus einem Bund in eine Datei schreiben
        extract  string  -- Der zu extrahierende Schl=FCssel
                to  file specification  -- Die Zieldatei
                [key ring  file specification]  -- Das Schl=FCsselbund <p>

remove: Schl=FCssel aus einem Bund l=F6schen
        remove  string  -- Der fragliche Schl=FCssel
                [key ring  file specification]  -- Das Schl=FCsselbund <p>

certify: =D6ffentlichen Schl=FCssel unterschreiben
        certify  string  -- Der zu unterschreibende Schl=FCssel
                [key ring  file specification]  -- Das Schl=FCsselbund
                [user id  string]  -- Einer Name <p>

fingerprint: Fingerabdruck zum Schl=FCssel errechnen.
        fingerprint  string  -- Der fragliche Schl=FCssel
                [key ring  file specification]  -- Das Schl=FCsselbund
        Result:   string -- Der Fingerabdruck <p>

letter from Phil Zimmerman requesting Positive uses of PGP <p>

Subject:   Positive uses of PGP
Date: Sun, 3 Apr 1994 20:32:08 -0700 (PDT)
From: Jeff Davis &lt;eagle@deeptht.armory.com&gt;
To: eff-activists (eff-activists mailing list) <p>

I'm forwarding this message from Phil Zimmermann. <p>

====================================================================
To all PGP users: <p>

We've all heard arguments raised by the law enforcement and
intelligence communities that PGP and other encryption technology can
be used by criminals to hide their activities.  This line of
reasoning is being used to justify Government key escrow systems like
Clipper, and to clamp down on encryption technology like PGP.  It
would be helpful to come up with real-world examples of how PGP has
been used for good constructive purposes.  Journalists sometimes ask
me for examples of positive uses for PGP.  But most of my fan mail
from PGP users do not tell me what they are using it for. <p>

If you have any stories about how PGP is used for good purposes, I'd
like to see them.  Not just disaffected paranoid libertarians
embracing it for the theoretical benefits for a free society.  We
need to be able to cite examples of real people using PGP for good
ends.  Human rights activists using it are a great example.  But it
doesn't have to be in the Nobel-Prize winning catagory of human
endeavor (although that would be nice).  It could just be any
positive upbeat application that normal people can relate to in a
positive way, so I can tell reporters about it.  I'd like to hear
(actually, see some email) from real people who are actually using
PGP for good things. <p>

It could be for helping others, like protecting HIV patient records,
or keeping psychological counseling records.  Or conducting good
wholesome business that must remain confidential.  Or lawyers using
it to maintain confidential records and communications with their
clients.  Or, it could be for your own personal life, but for
wholesome upbeat uses, like sending love letters (you don't have to
supply any actual love letters), or keeping your diary. <p>

For those that don't know what PGP is:  Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) is
a free software program that encrypts email using public key
cryptography, allowing you to communicate securely with people you've
never met, without the prior exchange of keys over secure channels.
PGP has become the worldwide de facto standard for email encryption.
It's available on many Internet FTP sites and BBS systems. <p>

Please send me some email (to prz@acm.org), with the subject line
"Positive uses for PGP", so that I can quickly sort it out from the
rest of my email.  If it's a really good story, I may want to use it,
so let me know if I can and if I can give reporters the information.
You might not get a reply-- it depends on how much mail I get or how
busy I am when you send it. <p>

There is no prize for the best story, but for what it's worth, I'll
sign the public key of the person who submits the best story by
Monday, April 11th.  But keep sending stories after that date if
you've got them. <p>

This notice can be copied and reposted on any newsgroup or mailing
list that is likely to be familiar with PGP. <p>

AP Wire Story on NSA Manual <p>

NSA from A-1
Semiconfidential
rules circulate <p>

By Keay Davidson
EXAMINER SCIENCE WRITER
   It arrived mysteriously at an Austin, Texas, post office box by ""snail
mail'' - computerese for the Postal Service.
   But once the National Security Agency's employee handbook was translated
into bits and bytes, it took only minutes to circulate across the country.
   Thus did a computer hacker in Texas display his disdain for government
secrecy last week - by feeding into public computer networks the
semiconfidential document, which describes an agency that, during the darkest
days of the Cold War, didn't officially ""exist.''
   Now, anyone with a computer, telephone, modem and basic computer skills
can read the 36-page manual, which is stamped ""FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY'' and
offers a glimpse of the shadowy world of U.S. intelligence - and the personal
price its inhabitants pay.
   New NSA employees are warned:
   ""Your home, car pool, and public places are not authorized areas to
conduct classified discussions - even if everyone involved in the discussion
possesses a proper clearance and "need-to-know.' The possibility that a
conversation could be overheard by unauthorized persons dictates the need to
guard against classified discussions in non-secure areas.''
   The manual includes a list of telephone numbers for NSA offices including
the cryptically named ""Agency Anonymity'' and ""Cipher Lock Repair,'' and
the not-so-cryptic ""Alcohol Rehabilitation Program'' and ""Disposal of
Classified Waste.''
"Anal retentive and paranoid'
      The manual is ""so anal retentive and paranoid. This gives you some
insight into how they think,'' said Chris Goggans, the Austin hacker who
unleashed it on the computer world. His on-line nom de plume is ""Erik
Bloodaxe'' because ""when I was about 11, I read a book on Vikings, and that
name really struck me.''
   NSA spokeswoman Judi Emmel said Tuesday that ""apparently this document is
an (NSA) employee handbook, and it is not classified.''    Rather, it is an
official NSA employee manual and falls into a twilight zone of secrecy. On
one hand, it's ""unclassified.'' On the other hand, it's ""FOR OFFICIAL USE
ONLY'' and can be obtained only by filing a formal request under the U.S.
Freedom of Information Act, Emmel said.
   ""While you may take this handbook home for further study, remember that
it does contain "FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY' information which should be
protected,'' the manual warns. Unauthorized release of such information could
result in ""appropriate administrative action ... (and) corrective and/or
disciplinary measures.''
   Goggans, 25, runs an on-line electronic ""magazine'' for computer hackers
called Phrack, which caters to what he calls the ""computer underground.'' He
is also a computer engineer at an Austin firm, which he refuses to name.
   The manual recently arrived at Goggans' post office box in a white
envelope with no return address, save a postmark from a Silicon Valley
location, he says. Convinced it was authentic, he typed it into his computer,
then copied it into the latest issue of Phrack.
Private life not private
      Other hackers, like Grady Ward of Arcata, Humboldt County, and Jeff
Leroy Davis of Laramie, Wyo., redistributed the electronic files to computer
users' groups. These included one run by the Cambridge, Mass.-based
Electronic Frontier Foundation, which fights to protect free speech on
computer networks.
    Ward said he helped redistribute the NSA manual ""to embarrass the NSA''
and prove that even the U.S. government's most covert agency can't keep
documents secret.
   The action also was aimed at undermining a federal push for
data-encryption regulations that would let the government tap into computer
networks, Ward said.
    In the NSA, one's private life ceases to be private: A ""waiver must be
granted in advance of a marriage to or cohabitation with a foreign national
in order to retain one's access to NSA information ...'' the manual says.
""The marriage or intended marriage of an immediate family member (parents,
siblings, children) to a foreign national must also be reported. ... All
personnel, either employed by or assigned to NSA, must advise the Office of
Security of any changes in their marital status (either marriage or divorce),
cohabitation arrangements, or legal name changes.''
   There's nothing wrong with ""casual social associations with foreign
nationals,'' but during such associations ""you are encouraged to extend the
usual social amenities. Do not act mysteriously or draw attention to yourself
(and possibly to NSA) by displaying an unusually wary attitude.''
   None of the hackers thought he or she had done anything unpatriotic.
   ""The cloak of secrecy that the intelligence communities operate behind is
an archaic paradigm of global warfare,'' said Davis, whose business card
identifies him as an ""Outlaw Transcendentalist.''
   ""The Cold War's over ...'' Davis said. ""What, is a terrorist group going
to call the National Security Agency alcoholism hot line and say, "Hey, I
have a drinking problem, can I come in?'''

An International Cryptographic Experiment A Solution to the International Use of Cryptography? <p>

An International Cryptographic Experiment
      A Solution to the International Use of Cryptography? <p>

Stephen T. Walker
                Trusted Information Systems, Inc. <p>

April 12, 1994 <p>

Summary <p>

This document proposes a program that could fundamentally change
the international availability of information security products. <p>

There is an ever growing need by individuals, corporations, and
governments for improved protection of their sensitive
information.  At the same time, governments worldwide need to
maintain their prerogatives to control the use and export of
cryptography by their own countries.  This paper proposes a
development plan to provide a range of solutions to the
international availability of cryptography which meets the needs
of both governments and industry. <p>

This international plan has emerged from a variety of ideas
proposed by industry and governments in several countries. <p>

The Overall Problem <p>

As the world of business moves ever further into the information
age, the need to protect sensitive information from unauthorized
access is rapidly growing in all segments of the economy.
Failure to provide appropriate mechanisms for protecting
information vital to the functioning of an organization (be it a
business or government) threatens the very existence of that
organization.  Lack of such mechanisms will severely damage the
potential of any national or global information highway. <p>

And yet, the very availability of technological solutions to
protect essential business and government information threatens a
vital function of modern government in the information age, the
monitoring of communications of its adversaries, be they
terrorists, criminals, or others. <p>

The dilemma posed by these fundamental and conflicting interests
is causing difficult and emotional debates within many countries
today.  The lack of a solution acceptable to both sides is
frustrating both government and business interests and keeping
much highly sensitive information at risk of compromise. <p>

The Ingredients of the Problem <p>

Until very recently, the use of cryptographic techniques for
protecting information from unauthorized access was the exclusive
domain of governments.  Only in the past fifteen years have
algorithms such as the Data Encryption Standard and techniques
such as public key cryptography made cryptography available to
ordinary business interests.  Only in the past few years has the
wide spread use of information networks raised the general
public's awareness of the need for such protection. <p>

Governments have long protected their prerogatives in
cryptography through control of its export, import, and, in some
cases internal use.  As cryptography has become available
worldwide, continuation of these controls by governments has been
seen as increasingly futile and restrictive by information system
developers and users.  Nevertheless, the restrictions remain and
the penalties are sufficiently severe to strongly curtail the
availability of popular information system products with
integrated cryptographic capabilities.  Vendors of major mass
market software systems with worldwide markets will not afford to
build products they cannot ship to all their existing and
potential markets. <p>

Meanwhile in an effort to establish what it feels is a reasonable
balance between the interests of privacy and those of the law
enforcement community, the US government has introduced a
technique it calls key escrow that makes available strong
cryptography while maintaining the interests of law enforcement
by allowing decryption of key-escrowed communications when
legally authorized. <p>

The recently announced Tessera initiative by the US National
Security Agency (NSA) places the cryptographic functions for
protection of unclassified but sensitive information in an
external card (called a PCMCIA card) that interfaces to
applications running on a workstation or laptop computer.  This
approach, which employs key escrow, has the advantage of
isolating the cryptography from the computer system, thus making
it difficult to modify and easier to control its distribution. <p>

While the details of key escrow bother some, the US is proceeding
with Tessera for at least government use.  Other governments are
said to be considering similar programs. <p>

Meanwhile, business groups within most western countries continue
to try to convince their governments that the growing worldwide
availability of cryptography makes further control of
cryptographic export both futile and highly restrictive to the
economic interests of those countries.  These efforts may
eventually succeed in loosening some export control restrictions,
but any coordinated worldwide relaxation of controls is highly
unlikely in the near future. <p>

An Interim Solution That Meets the Needs of Both Sides? <p>

In the meantime, it is useful to explore alternatives that may
provide at least partial solutions to this international dilemma
while satisfying the interests of both sides.  The seeds of one
potential solution come from a number of sources within various
national government and industry initiatives. <p>

The success of the NSA Tessera initiative depends upon the
information systems industry adopting a common set of interface
standards for Cryptographic Application Programming Interfaces
(CAPIs).  The Tessera program has defined an initial set of such
standards, but they must be endorsed industry-wide to succeed. <p>

Various vendors such as Hewlett-Packard and National
Semiconductor have proposed the development of additional PCMCIA
card configurations that would make use of standard CAPIs and
allow individual countries to implement their own collections of
cryptographic algorithms serving their own particular needs.  If
common CAPIs were to be widely adopted, initiatives such as the
Tessera program in individual countries would be much more likely
to succeed. <p>

In the United Kingdom, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) has begun a
Security in Open Systems (SOS) Technology Demonstration Programme
(TDP) with a specific objective of defining such CAPIs and
attempting to get them widely adopted by industry and government
throughout the world. <p>

These proposals, sparked in part by the Tessera program, could
bring about a fundamental change in the availability of
information security capabilities.  With common CAPIs at
sufficiently high levels of abstraction, mass market software
developers could include the capability for cryptographic
functions in their products without implementing any particular
cryptographic algorithms.  Such products, which rely on the user
selecting the actual cryptography to be used at the time of
actual use, should be readily exportable.  The user in a
particular country would choose among those available
cryptographic PCMCIA cards in that country to perform the actual
encryption functions. <p>

This approach offers the dual advantages of freeing major
software vendors to include some form of cryptographic function
in their products while allowing governments to retain the same
controls they now have over the export, import, and use of
cryptography.  Governments that wish to pursue techniques like
key escrow can "enter the marketplace" and "prove" the advantages
of their approach. <p>

A program to define and place such CAPIs in use internationally
requires no legislation (at least in most western countries) and
can be adopted through industry-wide cooperation, drawing from
already available draft CAPI standards. <p>

An International Cryptographic Experiment <p>

What is needed now is a consortium of interested parties in
industry and government to define preliminary standards and place
them in use on an experimental basis for a period of a year or
two.  After this test period, international standards
organizations would be requested to adopt the resulting CAPIs for
widespread use throughout the world. <p>

This paper proposes three phases for such an experiment: <p>

CAPI Definition Phase (3 to 6 months) <p>

A rapid effort over three to six months to define an initial
     set of cryptographic application programming interfaces for
     use in the experiment.  These interfaces would be derived
     from the Tessera interface standards, a National Institute
     of Standards and Technology draft entitled Standard for
     Cryptographic Service Calls, other publicly available
     specifications from industry in the US, UK, Canada, Germany
     and elsewhere, and from the efforts of programs such as the
     UK Technology Demonstration Programme.  This effort should
     look at such interfaces in the context of multiple
     cryptographic algorithms. <p>

Development Phase (3 to 6 months) <p>

Application Software Development.  Major software
     application developers would include cryptographic function
     calls to the high-level CAPIs within their products.
     Products containing these function calls would be tested
     against the PCMCIA implementations that would be developed
     in the next phase.  These high-level products that contain
     no cryptography themselves should not be subject to export
     controls in most countries.  All exports of these products
     will be coordinated with the country's government in which
     they are developed. <p>

PCMCIA card implementations.  Cryptographic functions that
     meet the CAPIs would be implemented in each participating
     country in accordance with the cryptography available in
     that country.  These implementations may not be exportable
     from the country of implementation depending upon the type
     of cryptography used. <p>

Experimental Use Phase (one to two years) <p>

As soon as applications using the CAPIs are generally
     available and PCMCIA implementations of specific
     cryptography are available in specific countries, a one-to-
     two-year experimental period will commence.  During this
     period, coordination of use within each participating
     country and among participating countries (where compatible
     cryptography is available) will validate the design and
     implementation of the CAPIs and lead to additional
     application development.  Because the actual use of
     cryptography is constrained to be in accordance with the
     internal regulations of each  participating country, there
     should be no export issues with this phase.  Following the
     experimental use phase, international standards
     organizations will be consulted to begin adoption of the
     validated CAPIs as international standards. <p>

Additional Thoughts <p>

The approach proposed herein relies on the use of PCMCIA cards
for isolating the selection of cryptographic functions to a
user's decision at the time of use rather than a developer's
decision at the time of implementation.  This time-of-use feature
is essential to allowing application developers to employ high-
level cryptographic functions without encountering export
controls. <p>

However, the use of PCMCIA devices is considered a disadvantage
by many because of extra hardware costs and potential performance
issues.  It may be possible within a particular country to
implement system level cryptographic software compatible with the
PCMCIA CAPIs.  Such software functions would be subject to export
control and if integrated directly into the general purpose
application, would render that version of the application
unexportable.  If a sufficient market existed within a particular
country, overcoming the hardware disadvantages may be worth the
export restrictions. <p>

Some will argue that this approach does not satisfy government's
concerns with the widespread availability of cryptography.  In
reality, though, this approach gives governments that wish to
pursue techniques such as key escrow their best chance for
success by providing a wide marketplace of application programs
that can easily be used by their PCMCIA cards so long as they are
compatible with the evolving worldwide standards. <p>

Froomkin on Clipper keys <p>

The tireless eagle@armory.com dug this up, not sure if you've seen it. <p>

From:   IN%"MFROOMKI@umiami.ir.miami.edu"  "Michael Froomkin" <p>

The cites are there (and in a good administrative law book too: try eg
Mashaw, Merril &amp; Shane 3rd ed.) <p>

_Executive Summary_ <p>

Bottom line for the crypto proposal: <p>

Congress cannot hold the keys.
Courts cannot hold the keys.
Only an agency in the executive branch of government can hold the
keys. <p>

Up to a point (which is not well defined) an agency can be created
with is headed by a person shielded from Presidential dismissal
(commonly known as an "independent agency").  It may be that the
head of this agency could be appointed by the court, although the
leading case on the subject concerns the appointment of a
prosecutor by a court, which is a more traditional judicial
function than the appointment of a trustee or custodian. <p>

_end executive summary_ <p>

_ The Problem _ <p>

The Supreme Court's separation of powers decisions are
generally agreed to be hopelessly contradictory.  Academic
commentators accuse the Court, with much justice, of zigzagging
between formalism and functionalism.  See, e.g.,  Stephen L.
Carter, From Sick Chicken to Synar: The Evolution and Subsequent
De-Evolution of the Separation of Powers, 1987 B.Y.U. L. Rev. 719;
Stephen L. Carter, The Independent Counsel Mess, 102 Harv. L. Rev.
105 (1988); Erwin Chemerinsky, A Paradox Without a Principle: A
Comment on the Burger Court's Jurisprudence in Separation of Powers
Cases, 60 S. Cal. L. Rev. 1083 (1987); E. Donald Elliott, Why Our
Separation of Powers Jurisprudence Is So Abysmal, 57 Geo. Wash. L.
Rev. 506 (1989); Peter L. Strauss, The Place of Agencies in
Government: Separation of Powers and the Fourth Branch, 84 Colum.
L. Rev. 573 (1984).  Peter L. Strauss, Was There A Baby In the
Bathwater?  A Comment on the Supreme Court's Legislative Veto
Decision, 1983 Duke L.J. 789. <p>

If one can bring oneself to ignore the doctrinal temptations
posed by the irreconcilable rationales of the cases set out below,
there is a general rule which explains all the results and even
offers some hope of predicting outcomes in future cases: Just as
Congress may increase the other two branches' powers by statutes
conferring jurisdiction (on courts) or rule-making/action-taking
power (on the executive branch), so too may Congress constrain the
other two branches' exercise of their powers so long as Congress
strictly obeys two fundamental constraints. <p>

First, Congress must obey the strictures set out in Buckley
and Chadha, that neither it nor other persons in the legislative
branch (broadly defined, cf. Bowsher), may constitutionally take
any action that affects the rights, duties, or responsibilities of
any person outside that branch except via the procedures of
bicameralism and presentment set out in Article I.  See I.N.S. v.
Chadha, 462 U.S. 919 (1983); Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1 (1976);
and Metropolitan Wash. Airports, __ U.S. __, 111 S. Ct. 2298
(1991). <p>

Second, the courts have jurisdiciton only to decide "cases
and controversies".   Outside the context of a lawsuit, there
are few acts that courts may take which might affect anyone's rights.
Courts may make rules of procedure, and they can (if Congress
wishes) make inter-branch appointments.  But that's about it. <p>

Third, all three branches' powers can be divided into the two
classes of enumerated and unenumerated powers.  Congress' power to
limit the President's enumerated powers is relatively slight.  It
exists only when Congress can assert a directly relevant enumerated
power of its own.  See, e.g., Public Citizen v. United States Dep't
of Justice, 491 U.S. 440, 467, 483-89 (1989) (Kennedy, J.,
concurring in judgment) (application of open meetings law to ABA
consultation with Justice Department on judicial appointments would
impermissibly infringe President's enumerated appointment power);
Nixon, 433 U.S. at 443 (upholding statutory intrusion into disposal
of presidential papers on grounds that President had no relevant
enumerated power); United States v. Klein, 80 U.S. (13 Wall.) 128
(1871) (statute seeking to alter effect of presidential pardon
unconstitutional interference with enumerated presidential power).
But, Congress' power to check other, unenumerated, presidential
powers is somewhat greater. <p>

Overall, the Court's decisions fit a pattern in which
Congress' power to check the other branches by determining their
structure is very great, but Congress is checked by the
requirements that it not aggrandize its own powers and that it act
through persons outside the legislature (which usually means
persons in the Executive or the Judiciary, although Congress is
also capable of taking certain types of actions, such as granting
a charter to a federal corporation, which act directly on private
parties and require little or no action by the other branches).
Thus, in Myers, Buckley, Chadha, Bowsher, and Metropolitan
Airports, separation of powers was violated by Congress seeking to
reserve an executive power for itself.  Myers concerned a
congressional attempt to require Senatorial approval before a
postmaster was fired.  Myers v. United States, 272 U.S. 52 (1926).
Bowsher held that the Comptroller General could not be an executive
branch official because Congress reserved the right to remove him
by legislation.  Bowsher, 478 U.S. at 714.  Chadha struck down the
one-house veto because it impermissibly inserted Congress into an
executive function.  Chadha, 461 U.S. at 919.  Metropolitan
Airports held that Congresspersons could not serve on a commission
that had the power to reverse certain executive decisions.
Metropolitan Wash. Airports, 111 S. Ct. at 2298.  Humphrey's
Executor, Wiener, Morrison, Schor, and Mistretta all concerned
cases in which Congress had lessened the President's power (or
increased the Judiciary's) without reserving a corresponding power
for itself.  In Humphrey's Executor, Weiner, and Morrison the
statute in question reduced the President's removal power but did
not inject Congress into the procedure.  By contrast, in Commodity
Futures Trading Comm'n v. Schor, 478 U.S. 833, 856 (1986), the
Court noted that Congress was not seeking to increase its own
powers.  Indeed, when the issue is an unenumerated presidential
power, such as the power to remove executive branch officials, the
Supreme Court has, since at least 1838, most consistently focused
on whether Congress has impermissibly aggrandized itself, not on
whether the President's "nebulous" executive power is being
undermined.  See Kendall v. United States, 37 U.S. (12 Pet.) 524
(1838) (stating that although the President has a special
constitutional position "it by no means follows that every officer
in every branch of [a] department is under the exclusive direction
of the President"). <p>

Detailed discussion of a few issues of interest:
[For a fuller statement of the issues, see A. Michael Froomkin,
Note, In Defense of Administrative Agency Autonomy, 96 Yale L.J.
787 (1987) and Peter L. Strauss, The Place of Agencies in
Government: Separation of Powers and the Fourth Branch, 84 Colum.
L. Rev. 573 (1984).] <p>

_The Myers Decision_ <p>

In Myers v. United States, 272 U.S. 52 (1926) (holding statute
requiring Senate consent to presidential removal of postmaster was
unconstitutional). and Springer  Springer v. Government of
Philippine Islands, 277 U.S. 189 (1928) (holding that statute
permitting certain members of Phillippine legislature to vote
government-owned shares in corporations ex officio violated
principle of separation of powers) the Supreme Court took a
decidedly formalist approach to the problem, in which each branch's
powers were seen to be discernable and distinct. <p>

_The Modern View: Limits to Presidential Power (Constitutional
      Basis for Independent Agencies &amp; limits to their autonomy)_ <p>

The modern view begins with Humphrey's Executor v. United
States, 295 U.S. 602 (1935) (upholding statute preventing President
from firing FTC Commissioner without cause against constitutional
challenge) and Wiener v. United States, 357 U.S. 349 (1958)
(holding that statute which was silent as to tenure in office of
member of "quasi-judicial" War Claims Commission would be
interpreted to bar President from dismissing member without cause).
In this more "functionalist" view, Congress is allowed to constrain
the power of the executive but did not consider to what extent
Congress could act by means other than legislation. <p>

_Limits to Congressional Power_ <p>

I.N.S. v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919 (1983) (holding that a two-
house legislative veto violates constitutional requirement that
Congress act in accordance with Presentment Clause of
Constitution), Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1 (1976) (holding that
Congresspersons could not constitutionally serve on FEC), Bowsher
v. Synar, 478 U.S. 714 (1986) (holding that Comptroller General
could not be an executive branch official because Congress reserved
the right to remove him by legislation and that therefore he could
not constitutionally exercise budget-cutting powers given to him by
Deficit Reduction Act) and Metropolitan Wash. Airports Auth. v.
Citizens for the Abatement of Aircraft Noise, Inc., __ U.S. __, 111
S. Ct. 2298 (1991) (holding that participation of members of
Congress in committee with power to veto decisions regarding local
airports violated separation of powers) collectively stand for the
proposition that unless Congress is using a constitionally
ennumerated power (e.g. the Senate's advice and consent power over
nominations and treaties), or regulationg purely internal matters
(e.g. who will be the Sargent at Arms of the House), the *only* way
in which Congress may affect the rightrs, duties or
responsibilities of a person outside the legislative branch is by
legislation, which is defined constitutionally as acts of both
houses which are the presented to the President for his signature. <p>

_The Courts' Inter-Bramch Appointment Power_ <p>

In Morrison v. Olson, 487 U.S. 654 (1988) (upholding
constitutionality of independent special prosecutor) the Supreme
Court upheld a procedure by which the special prosecutor was
appointed by the court.  The opinion has been criticized fo
fudging the extent to which the special prosecutor was independent
of the President and Attorney General.  But the inter-branch
appointment power is rooted in the constitution, which states that
Congress may vest the appointment of "inferior officers, as they
think proper, in the President alone, in the courts of law, or in
the Heads of Departments." (U.S. Const. Art II. sec. 2 para 2). <p>

_ Limits on Judicial Power _ <p>

Marbury v. Madison held that the federal courts have the power
and duty to refuse to take on tasks that are beyond their
jurisdiction.  Federal courts have historically been conscious of
hteir status as courts of limited jurisdiction and have been
vigillant to block moves by congress to give them non-judical
tasks.  Thus, for example, federal courts have refused to give
advisory opinions.  It is a truism, but no less true for that
reason, that a federal court has no jurisdiction to affect private
or public rights in the absence of a case or controversy. <p>

The closest thing to contrary authority of which I am aware is
Mistretta v. United States, 488 U.S. 361 (1989) (upholding
constitutionality of Sentencing Commission against challenge
predicated on participation of Article III judges on commission).
The decision justified the participation of judges on the grounds
that sentencing was a judicial matter. <p>

`Genie Is Out of the Bottle' <p>

By William M. Bulkeley
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal <p>

BOULDER, Colo. - During the battle between Boris Yeltsin and the Russian
Parliment last October, with Russian freedom hanging in the balance, software
author Philip Zimmermann received an electronic-mail message from Latvia.
"If dictatorship takes over Russia," it read, "your PGP is widespread from
Baltic to Far East now and will help democratic people if necessary.
Thanks."
   PGP - for Pretty Good Privacy - is a program written by Mr. Zimmermann for
scrambling computer messages.  Dissidents around the world use it to protect
their electronic communications from the prying eyes of secret police.
   But PGP has a darker side.  In Sacramento, Calif., police lament that last
year, PGP encryption blocked them from reading the computer diary of a
convicted pedophile and finding critical links in a suspected
child-pornography ring.
   Admired by freedom lovers and criminals alike, PGP is one thing:
uncrackable, or as close to it as a secret code has ever been.  Even U.S.
government snoopers can't break it.  And that places Mr. Zimmermann - a
paunchy, bearded, 40-year-old computer consultant who is fast becoming a
folk hero on the information highway - in peril.
   A federal grand jury in San Jose, Calif., is examining weather he broke
laws against exporting encryption codes.  The Federal Bureau of Investigation
suspects that Mr. Zimmermann had a role in putting PGP on the Internet, the
world-wide web of computer networks, making it easy for foreign governments
and terrrorists to use it and render their computer traffic impervious to
U.S. spying.
   Mr. Zimmermann's lawyer says his client could face charges carrying a
prison term of up to 51 months.
   The world-wide use of Mr. Zimmermann's software has altered forever
notions of government surveillance, electronic privacy and export bans on
cryptography.  Until recently, difficult codes could always be deciphered
by stealing the key that unraveled the encryption puzzle.  During World
War II, for example, the Allies captured a German encrypting Enigma machine,
allowing them to crack Nazi communications.  U.S. convoys taking munitions
to Britain used it to help them elude German U-boats. <p>

Keys Are the Key
   But PGP, like a growing number of encryption programs, takes advantage of
a new, mathematically sophisticated encrypting technology that requires two
different keys, both of which are necessary to unlock the puzzle.  The sender
needs only one to send a message.  The receiver decodes the message with the
second key - which never needs to leave his computer, where it can be
protected by passwords from easy pilfering.  Although the mathematics are
daunting, the program makes the process quick and straightforward.
   In an age when computers can whip up codes of devilish complexity and
zip them around the globe for anyone with a personal computer, the lot of
the encryption policeman is not a happy one.  The internet alone reaches 20
million people.
   "The genie is out of the bottle," says Leonard Mikus, president of
ViaCrypt, a Phoenix company that sells a $100 version of PGP in the U.S.
"There's no way anybody can stop the technology." <p>

The Personal Touch
   The availability world-wide of encryption programs makes export controls
"a farce," says Stephen Walker, a former top National Security Agency
cryptographer who is now president of Trusted Information Systems Inc., a
research firm in Glenwood, Md.  He says he knows European government
officials who use PGP for their personal e-mail.  "We have to recognize
what's out there."
   Mr. Zimmermann, a twice-arrested anti-nuclear-war activist, became an
electronic freedom-fighter in 1990.  At that time, the FBI and the NSA were
pushing for a law that would ban certain forms of encryption, and force
computer makers to build into their machines hardware that would allow
law-enforcement agencies to decipher any code that was used.  The proposal
outraged confidentiality-minded corporations and computer users alike.
Eventually, it was dropped.
   But while the issue was still open, Mr. Zimmermann took it upon himself
to thwart the government's purpose by working on what came to be PGP - an
impenetrable code that could be used by virtually anyone.  "I did it to
inoculate the body politic" from the danger of government prying, he says.
   Mr. Zimmermann stopped consulting and holed up in the computer-filled
workroom in the back of a bungalow in Boulder, where he lives with his wife
and two children.  He said he spent six months of 12-hour days writing the
program, drained his family's savings and missed five months of mortgage
payments.  He finished the program in June 1991, and named it Pretty Good
Privacy - in deference to Ralph's Pretty Good Grocery in humorist Garrison
Keillor's Prairie Home Companion radio show.
   When Mr. Zimmermann was through, he gave the encryption program to
friends.  One of them, whom he won't identify, placed it on the Internet,
sometime around June or July 1991, he says.  Once there, any computer user
in the world with access to the Internet could download it.  Almost
immediately, many did.
   But federal laws covering munitions prohibit exporting encryption software
without a license.  A year ago, U.S. Customs Service agents asked Mr.
Zimmermann how his software went overseas.  In September the U.S. Attorney's
office in San Jose, which has expertise on computer crimes because of its
proximity to Silicon Valley, told Mr. Zimmermann that he was a target of an
investigation.  Mr. Zimmermann says he neither sent PGP overseas, nor posted
it on computer systems.
   RSA Data Security Inc. is also angry at Mr. Zimmermann.  The
computer-security firm says that in creating PGP, Mr. Zimmermann used one of
its patented cryptographic algorithms without permission, after RSA had
denied him a free license.
   "We sometimes joke that PGP stands for `Pretty Good Piracy,' " says James
Bidzos, president of the Redwood City, Calif., firm.  "What he did was
simple.  In this business, you simply don't rip off people's intellectual
property."  RSA, which sells its technology to most of the major sofware
makers and makes an encryption program called MailSafe, hasn't sued Mr.
Zimmermann.  But it has asserted its legal rights in letters to anyone it
catches using PGP.  As a result, few companies use PGP and many universities
and commercial on-line services keep it off their computers.
   Mr. Zimmermann says that technically he hasn't violated RSA patents
because he didn't sell the software until he signed the deal with ViaCrypt,
which does have a license to use the algorithm.  He notes that the on-line
documentation for PGP suggests that people who use the program should contact
RSA about a license.
   For many individuals, PGP has become something of a standard for
encrypted e-mail on the Internet.  A Glendale, Calif., college student who
goes by the name Monk on the Internet says, "It's free; it's solid; it
promotes privacy.  How can you argue with it?"  While the NSA wants to keep
control of encryption, "This teeny little company with a wonderful hero has
changed that," says Thomas Lipscomb, president of InfoSafe Corp., a New York
developer of security devices for CD-ROM publishers.
   Fear that hackers may intercept e-mail has spawned a grass-roots cult of
PGP users in the Internet community.  Craig McKie, a sociology professor at
Carleton University in Ottawa, encrypts chapters of a new book with PGP as
he sends them to his publisher, fearing that otherwise, "a gazillion copies
would go flying off into the night."  Lance Cottrell, an astronomer at the
University of California, San Diego, says he uses PGP to share unpublished
observations with collaborators to keep others from claim-jumping a
discovery.
   PGP also helps make the otherwise leaky internet safe for commerce.
Members of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a group that advocates
electronic free speech, can pay dues by sending PGP-encrypted credit-card
numbers over computer networks.  S. Soloway Inc., a Palo Alto, Calif.,
accounting firm, scrambles backup tapes with PGP, so that clients needn't
worry about lost confidentiality if the tapes are lost or stolen.  Kenneth
Bass, a Washington lawyer, communicates with some clients and other
attorneys in PGP code.
   For human-rights advocates, the consequences of compromised sources can
be devastating.  Daniel Salcedo, who works for the Human Rights Project of
the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Washington,
teaches activists in El Salvador and Guatemala to use PGP.  "In this
business, lots of people have been killed," Mr. Salcedo says.
   Alan Dawson, a writer living in Thailand, says rebels opposing the regime
in neighboring Burma are using PGP to encrypt information sent among rebel
groups.  Before use of PGP became widespread, Mr. Dawson wrote Mr.
Zimmermann, "captured documents have resulted directly in arrests, including
whole families and their torture and death."
   But investigators say PGP and other encryption systems aid crime.
William Spernow, a computer-crime specialist with Search Group, a federally
funded police-training firm in Sacramento, Calif., predicts criminals will
routinely encrypt information within two years.  "This could signal the end
of computer forensics before it even gets off the ground," he says.
   Mr. Bidzos of RSA says that he has had several calls from police in the
Miami area asking for help in decrypting information on computers seized in
drug raids.  He says the encryption is unbreakable.  Mr. Spernow studied one
case where a criminal conducted a fraud by keeping a double set of books -
the real set encrypted in PGP.
   Mr. Zimmermann says he is disturbed by criminal use of encryption, but
thinks the benefit of providing electronic privacy to everyone outweighs
the costs.  "It is impossible to obtain real privacy in the information age
without good cryptography," he says.
   Encryption also raises some eyebrows inside corporations.  Mr. Bass, the
Washington lawyer, notes that most companies assert the right to read
employees' e-mail, since it is composed on their computers and travels their
networks.  "What will they do when people start encrypting messages to each
other?" he asks.
   Without e-mail encryption, widespread surveillance would be easier.  In
theory, CIA, FBI and police computers could tap telephone cables and look
for key words such as "missile" or "bomb" to find people who needed closer
watching.  Mr. Zimmermann says: "This is analogous to drift-net fishing."
   Computerized encryption "is a technology that for a change benefits our
civil liberties," he adds.  "The government law-enforcement agencies have
benefited from many technologies," such as telephones that made wire-
tapping undetectable.  In fact, Mr. Zimmermann is currently seeking funding
for a project to create a phone that uses a personal computer equipped with
a microphone and a speaker, to encrypt voice conversations just as PGP
encrypts data exchanges.
   Mr. Zimmermann has been suspicious of the government for a long time.
After growing up in Boca Raton, Fla., where a children's book on secret
writing first interested him in codes, he moved to Boulder in 1978 and
worked as a computer engineer.  After he was laid off by Storage Technology
Corp. in 1985, along with 3,000 others, he became a consultant specializing
in telecommunications and data security.
   In the 1980s he became worried about the nuclear-arms race.  He and his
wife investigated moving to New Zealand.  But they stayed in Boulder, an
antiwar hotbed, where he lectured on arms policy.
   Mr. Zimmermann says that he has not been active on the internet and adds,
"I'm not a cipherpunk - I wear a suit when I visit clients."  But he says
he agrees with the electronic free-speech ideals of the cipherpunks, the
Internet habitues who fill cyberspace with blistering criticisms about the
U.S. government's proposal to promote use of the so-called "Clipper chip."
The chip would let companies and individuals encrypt sensitive
communications, but the government would hold a key making it possible -
with court permission - to decipher them for law-enforcement or
national-security purposes.
   Mr. Zimmermann thinks the Clipper project confirms the need for PGP by
showing the government's desire to read electronic mail.  "They're treating
us like an enemy foreign population," he says. <p>

My Testimony before the Committee on Science, Space and Technology 3 May 1994 <p>

Testimony before the
Committee on Science, Space and Technology
Subcommittee on Technology, Environment and Aviation
U.S. House of Representatives <p>

Hearing on
Communications and Computer Surveillance, Privacy and Security <p>

May 3, 1994 <p>

David J. Farber
The Alfred Fitler Moore Professor of Telecommunication Systems
University of Pennsylvania
200 S. 33 rd Street
Philadelphia PA 19104-6389
Net: farber@cis.upenn.edu <p>

I.      Introduction <p>

Good morning Mr. Chairman and members of the subcommittee. I want to thank
the Committee for inviting me to testify today. <p>

I should start off by stating that the views I will give are my own, and
not necessarily those of any organizations that I am affiliated with --
although I hope they agree with my views. I am speaking merely as a
professional with long experience in the computer and communications
field. <p>

My background has been focused on the understanding of and the development
of technology in the computer and communications area. I started my career
in 1956 with a BS in General Engineering from Stevens Institute of
Technology. Due to the influence of a friend, I interviewed Bell Telephone
Laboratories even though I was accepted into graduate school. I accepted a
very challenging job at Bell Labs helping design the worlds first
electronic switching system which was later installed at Morris,
Illinois. It was the ENIAC of the computer-based telephone systems we have
today. I later went on to do pioneer work in programming languages and
after a period at the RAND Corp. I left industry to join the University of
California at Irvine (UCI) as a faculty member. At UCI I was responsible
for the conceptualization of the first operational distributed computer
system sponsored by the NSF -- the DCS system which was the first use of
client-server ideas, along with the first micro kernel and the first
ring-type Local Area Network. On my journey to the University of
Pennsylvania where I hold the Chair of The Alfred Fitler Moore Professor
of Telecommunication Systems, I collaborated in the creation and operation
of CSNET and the NREN as well as co-authoring the  proposal for the
Gigabit Testbeds. I have served on more industrial and government advisory
committees than is reasonable and am a Fellow of the IEEE. I serve on the
Board of Trustees of both the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the
Internet Society. <p>

My career has been focused on the understanding of, and the development
of, technology in the communications area. I have co-founded several of
the data networks which have led to the National Information
Infrastructure and have taken part in the creation of some of the
technology that makes it possible. For the last several years I have also
been increasingly involved with the policy problems and opportunities
that this technology has created. So while my remarks will focus largely
on the technical aspects of the Clipper and the Digital  Telephony
initiatives I would like to start out by expressing some of my views on
policy and also my views as a concerned citizen. <p>

II.     Public Policy Challenges Posed By New Information &amp; Communication
Technologies <p>

We are at a critical stage in the evolution of a capability that could
rival the industrial revolution in bringing both  good and bad to the
citizens of this nation. The industrial revolution brought unheard of
prosperity to parts of the world and pain and suffering also. The
information revolution, and it is a revolution, can bring a burst of
prosperity and vigor to a world which is increasingly stuck in a morass of
slow growth, regionalization and trade conflicts. <p>

The information revolution is a stew based on a blend made possible by
increasingly complex communications technology mixed with increasingly
more powerful computers. The National Information Infrastructure (NII) and
it's sister the Global Information  Infrastructure (GII) are among the
exciting developments arising out of this technology "stew". All in all,
we have an unprecedented transfer of power into the hands of the public
and the government that results from these technologies. Computer power
that served the entire technical staff of Bell Labs when I was there is
now available in my hand. Communications capabilities only dreamed of in
the Saturday movie serials is now readily available worldwide. This vastly
increased power in the hands of the public has created difficulties for
the policy makers. While technology increases in power at a rate of two
times per year, our ability to understand the policy  implications of
this, sadly, grows very slowly. <p>

This has shown itself recently in the debate about the Clipper encryption
initiative and the Digital Telephony proposals both put forward by the
Clinton/Gore administration and backed heavily by the law enforcement
community. A careful look at each of these initiatives illuminates the
fundamental national issues that are being fought out. <p>

It is critical that this discussion be brought out into that part of the
policymaking process which has always represented the citizens -- the
Congress.  I take as one of my guidelines in thinking about these issues,
a quote by Ben Franklin -- the Founder of the University I am at -- "They
that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety
deserve neither liberty nor safety." <p>

A.      Clipper and the proposed escrow system <p>

The proposed key escrow system that is part of the "Clipper" proposal for
providing securable telephony has been subject to many and often loud
debates in the press and in the Internet world. Many worry that such an
escrow system could be vulnerable to misuse by a future administration or
overzealous law enforcement organizations.  The result of any such misuse
would be a major blow to the privacy rights of our citizens. The
counter-argument is based on arguments that it is no worse than we now
have -- namely no cryptographic protection in widespread use, and a fear
of increasing difficulties due to technology and the ease of computer
supported voice encryption. Clearly the issues are basic to the way we
will live in the future that is, what will happen to both our liberty and
our safety. Currently the discussants have taken extreme positions -- as
is normal for the beginning of such a critical discussion. Neither side is
capable of explaining to the other the reasons for their support of or
concerns about the proposal. <p>

Thus I believe that we must carefully examine the proposed escrow system
to insure that we have not done the trade that Franklin warned us about,
but rather, that we have used all available technology to ensure that we
end up with more safety and more liberty. <p>

The Administration's Clipper proposal to create an escrowed cryptographic
system for  telephony came out of the blue, at least as far as my
community is concerned. When I sent out the first announcement of the
Clipper proposal to my "interesting people" mailing list (a list that goes
widely to senior people in academia, government and industry) my only
comment was "basically the issue is 'do you trust your government'". One
of the replies I received from a 23 year old person I know well said that
"to my generation, the term 'trust government' has no meaning". Sad but
true!!. <p>

The Clipper announcement was sketchy, lacking substance and real form. We
all "waited for the beef" but there was unfortunately no such beef. The
main ingredient of the initiative and it's most controversial aspect --
the escrow system -- was not yet really designed. The reaction was, to put
it mildly, mostly shock and outrage and even sadness. There were
insufficient details about the Clipper system to enable us to make a
competent technical evaluation of the overall security of the proposal,
including all of its escrow management procedures. Those of us in industry
and in academe, see our role as helping to assess for both the corporate
community and individual users, the security and privacy of computer and
communications systems. To this date, we have been unable to perform this
function because most of the details of Clipper are shrouded in secrecy. <p>

B.      Where are we and where can we go <p>

One of the facts of life in the Information Age is that powerful tools
such as encryption are and will be increasingly more available to
law-abiding citizens, business users, people all over the world, and, of
course, to criminals.  This does pose challenges to law enforcement, but
there's nothing we can do to stop this technology.  All that the
government can do is to slow things down.  We have to face it. Perhaps we
can slow it down and leave it to our children to face these facts of life.
But in my view we have created the world that presents these challenges
and we should attempt to solve the problems and to leave a better world to
our children. <p>

We should not, however, underestimate the depth of the problem that
sophisticated encryption technology and the information age thrusts upon
us.  On the one hand, individual citizens and large corporations
desperately need encryption to protect their personal privacy and
corporate security.  On the other hand, this same technology, if used by
criminals, can make law enforcements efforts to conduct investigations
more difficult.  So, we need technology and public policy in response to
this dilemma which assure privacy and security, enables law enforcement to
continue to do its job, and, at the same time, respects fundamental civil
liberties which are at the heart of our constitutional system of
government. In my technical judgment, the solution to this problem will
not come easily and will certainly not come in one simple step. <p>

The position of the Administration worries many in the technical community
since they feel it is but the first step to the banning of any form of
encryption except that approved and escrowed by the government. The
Clinton Administration says "not on our watch" and I believe them.
However, our grandchildren will not have them on the watch when they grow
up. So, we need a lasting and effective solution to this problem, not a
quick fix that is technologically unsound and unwise as a matter of public
policy. <p>

C.      Open Technical Processes Are Best For Solving Hard Problems <p>

Even those of us who disagee about Clipper, agree that we are faced with a
hard technical and policy problem.  So, the question we should be asking
is: how does the communications world solve hard problems and are we on
track with Clipper? A long history of setting technical standards in the
communications industry has shown that solving hard technical problems
requires an open design process.  The protocols which are the basis of the
Internet were not created by ten people in a "smoke-filled room". They
evolved openly and sometimes noisily in a highly stressed and highly
productive set of interactions. They took over the world and created the
basis for the National Information Infrastructure. An examination of the
internet standards activity clearly shows the payoff in openness. <p>

The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), an open organization attended
by all the players with stakes in internet developments, has often faced
the situation where two group develop their ideas in different fashions:
One group meets in an open public fashion, with constant interactions with
different ideas and different economic imperatives of those
participating.   Another group goes off and sits in  smoke-filled rooms
designing alternatives in a closed environment. When both are shown to the
IETF as a whole, the open design always wins. It has all the rough spots
smoothed out and arguments done prior to disclosure. The closed design
gets sunk on having to do the smoothing when it is too late. Multimedia
Mail, a major future use of the NII, is a good case in point. There are
many others examples. <p>

Clipper is in the same boat. While I recognize that a small part of
cryptography will always be classified, most of the development of the
proposed escrow system has been taking place in those room ( not
smoke-filled any more). This process must be brought out into the sunshine
of the technical and policy community. Proposals like Clipper must be
evolved, if they are to have any chance of success, with the co-operation
and understanding of the industrial and academic community and their
enthusiastic cooperation rather than their mistrust. This penchant for
openness must not be seen as a power struggle between industry and
government, or as an excuse for revisiting a decision that technologists
dislike for political reasons.  Rather it is a reflection of a deep faith
in open design processes and a recognition that closed processes
invariably lead to solutions which are too narrow and don't last. <p>

A Strawman Proposal <p>

To make my thinking more concrete I have included  a much abbreviated
design that  is predicated on a desire to properly control and
authenticate the use of taps and decryption devices to ensure their use
only under proper judicial supervision. It is intended to provide a
greatly improved and protected mechanism to ensure that proper judicial
control is kept and that auditable records exist. I personally believe
there are technical safeguards that can be engineered into a key escrow
system that could greatly increase privacy and security for users, while
ensuring that legitimate law enforcement access is maintained. <p>

The approach requires a change in the warrant mechanism as well as other
changes that may require legislative action.  I firmly believe that an
approach toward the creation of a freely exportable cryptographic system
that allows and perhaps even encourages, but does not demand, escrowed
keys could, given the right actions on the part of the congress greatly
improve the first amendment rights and the custom of personal privacy that
exists in the United States and at the same time provide law enforcement
with all the lawful access to crypto protected communications that our
constitution allows. <p>

The proposed design allows the user of an escrowed crypto-device (ECD) to
choose to have his keys escrowed with a set of escrow approved  holding
organizations (EAHO). An EAHO must conform to a set of rules and audits
that define its proper handling of key security, physical and electronic
security, management strength, and the ability to obtain a bond to protect
the owners of the ECD from illegal actions on the part of EAHO employees.
Thus the credibility of the EAHO is examined by the accrediting agency and
the organization which provides bonding. <p>

Given that the component keys (CK) have been transported to the chosen
EAHOs, the rest of this note describes the process that would be followed
in my proposed approach. <p>

When a law enforcement organization (LEO) wants to decrypt a protected
conversation, it go through the normal mechanism to find the ECD units
being used. The main difference from the existing process is that the
warrant they must obtain in order for the EAHOs to release their component
keys is as follows. <p>

The LEO obtains a warrant from a judicial source. This warrant is
registered as to the date of issue (could use the Bellcore spin-off
company) and contains within the warrant the specifics of ECD that will be
monitored as well as the length of time of thevalidity of the
authorization. The warrant is electronic in form and is then encrypted and
signed by the judicial source. It is sent to the LEO. The LEO then sends
the warrant along with its additional information to each of the escrow
organizations -- this transmission signed by the LEO. The EAHOs check the
validity of the LEO, and decrypt the warrant for validity, date and
duration. Given this is OK, it sends its part of the key along with the
original warrant back to the LEO encrypted under the LEO's public key and
signed by the EAHO. <p>

The LEO now can authenticate the EAHO. When the LEO has all parts of the
component keys, it ships the messages obtained from the EAHOs -- namely
the key parts and the warrant to the decryption "box" where the validity
of the warrant, its time of origination and length is again checked before
any decryption taking place. If any of these conditions fail, the request
for decryption is rejected. <p>

This alternative to Clipper will protect user privacy, ensure legitimate
law enforcement access, and has the important advantage of allowing
technology and standards to develop in an open, market-drive process. <p>

I would note, too, that the Clinton Administration has shown some interest
in pursuing open solutions such as the one I have outlined here.  This
sentiment is extremely encouraging to me and I would urge the subcommittee
to explore this option further with Administration officials.1 <p>

D.      What's my bottom line on Clipper <p>

Escrow key systems may offer a middle of the road solution to blend the
imperatives of technology with the stated but as yet un-substantiated
needs of law enforcement. However, in no case, should an escrow system be
considered unless it: <p>

* results in an environment which considerable increases the citizens
protection against illegal wiretaps <p>

and <p>

* provides for enabling laws, which would be necessary to establish the
electronic warrant system and auditability, must legislate against the
mandatory use of clipper technology <p>

and <p>

* removes export controls  on cryptography so as to establish a viable
market for American companies to produce products. <p>

III. Digital Telephony <p>

I will enumerate my objections to the proposal from a technical/economic
point of view. I join others in attacking it from a
privacy/freedom/necessity standpoint. <p>

In the Clipper controversy, one could find some benefits to the nation in
a properly designed system. In the case of the Digital Telephony proposal
it is difficult to see where there can be a silver lining. <p>

The Digital Telephony proposal calls for the manufacturers of telephone
central office switches, tandom switches and SS7 signaling systems to make
major design changes to their software systems. These changes would
provide, to law enforcement at remote sites, electronic notification of
calls to and from selected numbers/individuals as the individuals wander
through the complex communications structure that has been created in the
United States. <p>

I, and many others, expect that the law would have to be extended to cover
PBXs and even personal computers as they are used more and more as
personal communications devices. <p>

As a colleague of mine has often said "What guarantees that the job of law
enforcement should be easy?". Yet law enforcement noting the increased
complexity of the telecommunications systems and maybe even noticing the
ability of all the components of the NII to carry such communications, has
demanded the right to peek into our minds and to easily find out whom we
call and who calls us. <p>

I have often been credited with using the term "the Full Software
Employment Act of 1994" when I talk about the Digital Telephony proposal.
The proposers talk about costs in the multi hundreds of millions of
dollars to be borne by the Government for the first three years. After
that all is left open. <p>

As one who has in his time designed and built complex systems and who
understands the structure of the current telecommunications structure my
reactions are as follows. <p>

Rational estimates obtained from sources in the industry talk about
numbers from $1.5 to $3 billion  per year. I consider that low. The
complexity of just the Plain Old Telephone System software is enormous.
Re-designing large and often the most complex parts of it will not be easy
nor inexpensive. One must potentially re-engineer the cellular system with
its multiple manufacturers plus the local and toll and tandem switching
centers. The fact that they are programmed devices makes it feasible but
not cheap.  The potential for decreased reliability of the national
telephone grid caused by the large scale changes (presently undefined)  to
the software architecture could cause major dangers to the health and
economy of the country. If you watch the bugs (errors) that are
distributed in well tested and much similar systems (like DOS or MACOS)
you can appreciate the opportunities for chaos -- and it must be done in
three years. <p>

One should carefully note that the national communications system is
marginally reliable at this time. A National Research Council report on it
cautioned that it was poorly equipped to survive in the event of
catastrophies. The recent set of fiber cuts and the resultant severe
disruption of the nation's business is a portent for the future. To spend
money that is in short supply satisfying a poorly articulated and poorly
justified "problem" with wire tapping is to place the nation's economic
health in danger, for communication is the veins that carry the nation's
economic blood -- information. <p>

&gt;From the standpoint of the future evolution of our NII, the Digital
Telephony proposal presents a major drag. Whenever a new feature is being
considered for implementation and marketing, one very important issue will
be how much  it will cost to implement it in such a manner as to pass the
hurdles of the proposal. That could price many good ideas that would
improve the usefulness of our NII off the feasibility horizon. Not only
would our citizens not have access to these new and useful services but
they would not be implemented in US manufactured systems and thus could
make our systems less sellable in competition with those of foreign
manufacturers of communications equipment for off shore sales. Note that
off shore sales in the developing parts of the globe represent major
markets which we could lose. <p>

IV. Summary <p>

*       The Information Age poses hard problems for privacy protection,
security
and law enforcement <p>

*       Increasing amounts of personally sensitive and proprietary information
on global, digital networks creates need for security through encryption. <p>

*       Technical knowledge of how to create powerful and practically
unbreakable encryption technology is available throughout the world. <p>

*       Powerful encryption poses real challenges for law enforcement and
national security efforts. <p>

*       These challenges will not be solved by just a single chip such as
Clipper or even just a single legislative act such as the proposed Digital
Telephony bill. <p>

*       As a closed, secret, inflexible standard, Clipper will not be widely
accepted by the market <p>

*       Security systems must be trusted by the broad user community.  Clipper
will never be so trusted because the design of its internal algorithm is
secret <p>

*       Open systems are the only lasting solution to hard technical problems <p>

*       The history of the computer and communications industry has shown that
hard technical problems require open flexible solutions arrived at in an
open manner. <p>

*       The federal government should lead the way toward an open solution,
rather than trying in vain to force a closed solution on the problem. <p>

*       Real alternative to publicly revealed Clipper system design exist,
which
meet law enforcement goals while protecting privacy, civil liberties and
preserving technological flexibility. <p>

V. Conclusion <p>

There should be no doubt that new computer and communciations
technologies pose challenges for the law enforcement and national security
communities.  By the same token, for the National Information
Infrastructure to succeed, and for US companies to be able to compete in
the world market -- the Global Information Infrastructure -- user security
and privacy must be protected through robust, open cryptography standards.
The Congress and the Administration should lead the way toward solutions
that are open, provide for flexibility in the future, and seek an
appropriate balance of individual privacy and the legitimate needs of law
enforcement. I thank this subcommittee again for its foresight and
guidance in holding this hearing and look forward to working with you in
the future. <p>

FOOTNOTE <p>

1 I would like to explicitly support an idea originated by Steve Walker of
Trusted Information Systems, who proposes the voluntary establishment of
software interface standards to crypto devices and crypto software so that
manufacturers around the world, but especially in the United States, can
create software systems that can be used with nationally required crypto
systems around the world. Such an initiative would greatly enhance the
privacy of individuals and the market for such systems. It would also
create a major opportunity for American companies to market to the world.
Such an initiative would assist in the creation of the GII supported by
the Vice President <p>

Testimony <p>

of <p>

Jerry J. Berman, Executive Director
Electronic Frontier Foundation <p>

before the <p>

Committee on Science, Space and Technology <p>

Subcommittee on Technology, Environment and Aviation <p>

U.S. House of Representatives <p>

Hearing on <p>

Communications and Computer Surveillance, Privacy and Security <p>

May 3, 1994
Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee
        I want to thank you for the opportunity to testify today on
communications and computer surveillance, privacy, and security policy.
The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) is a public interest membership
organization dedicated to achieving the democratic potential of new
communications and computer technology and works to protect civil liberties
in new digital environments.  EFF also coordinates the Digital Privacy and
Security Working Group (DPSWG), a coalition of more than 50 computer,
communications, and public interest organizations and associations working
on communications privacy issues.  The Working Group has strongly opposed
the Administration's clipper chip and digital telephony proposals.
        EFF is especially pleased that this subcommittee has taken an
interest in these issues.  It is our belief that Administration policy
developed in this area threatens individual privacy rights, will thwart the
development of the information infrastructure, and does not even meet the
stated needs of law enforcement and national security agencies.  A fresh
and comprehensive look at these issues is needed. <p>

I.      Background on digital privacy and security policy
        From the beginning of the 1992 Presidential campaign, President
Clinton and Vice President Gore committed themselves to support the
development of the National Information Infrastructure.  They recognize
that the "development of the NII can unleash an information revolution that
will change forever the way people live, work, and interact with each
other."  They also know that the information infrastructure can only
realize its potential if users feel confident about security measures
available.
        If allowed to reach its potential, this information infrastructure
will carry vital personal information, such as health care records, private
communications among friends and families, and personal financial
transactions.  The business community will transmit valuable information
such as plans for new products, proprietary financial data, and other
strategic communications.  If communications in the new infrastructure are
vulnerable, all of our lives and businesses would be subject to both
damaging and costly invasion.
        In launching its Information Infrastructure Task Force (IITF) the
Clinton Administration recognized this when it declared that: <p>

The trustworthiness and security of communications channels and networks
are essential to the success of the NII....  Electronic information systems
can create new vulnerabilities.  For example, electronic files can be
broken into and copied from remote locations, and cellular phone
conversations can be monitored easily.  Yet these same systems, if properly
designed, can offer greater security than less advanced communications
channels.  [Agenda for Action, 9]
Cryptography -- technology which allows encoding and decoding of messages
-- is an absolutely essential part of the solution to information security
and privacy needs in the Information Age.  Without strong cryptography, no
one will have the confidence to use networks to conduct business, to engage
in commercial transactions electronically, or to transmit sensitive
personal information.  As the Administration foresees, we need <p>

network standards and transmission codes that facilitate interconnection
and interoperation between networks, and ensure the privacy of persons and
the security of information carried.... [Agenda for Action, 6]
While articulating these security and privacy needs, the Administration has
also emphasized that  the availability of strong encryption poses
challenges to law enforcement and national security efforts.  Though the
vast majority of those who benefit from encryption will be law abiding
citizens, some criminals will find ways to hide behind new technologies. <p>

II.     Current cryptography policy fails to meet the needs of the growing
information infrastructure
        As a solution to the conflict between the need for user privacy and
the desire to ensure law enforcement access, the Administration has
proposed that individuals and organizations who use encryption deposit a
copy of their private key -- the means to decode any communications they
send -- with the federal government.
         In our view, this is not a balanced solution but one that
undermines the need for security and privacy without resolving important
law enforcement concerns.  It is up to the Congress to send the
Administration back to the drawing board. <p>

A.      Current Export Controls and New Clipper Proposal Stifle Innovation
        Two factors are currently keeping strong encryption out of the
reach of United States citizens and corporations.  First, general
uncertainty about what forms of cryptography will and will not be legal to
produce in the future.  Second, export controls make it economically
impossible for US manufacturers that build products for the global
marketplace to incorporate strong encryption for either the domestic or
foreign markets.  Despite this negative impact on the US market, export
controls are decreasingly successful at limiting the foreign availability
of strong encryption.  A recent survey shows that of the more than 260
foreign encryption products now available globally, over 80 offer
encryption which is stronger than what US companies are allowed to export.
Export controls do constrain the US market, but the international market
appears to be meeting its security needs without help from US industry.
The introduction of Clipper fails to address the general uncertainty in the
cryptography market.  Announcement of a key escrow policy alone is not
sufficient to get the stalled US cryptography market back on track. <p>

B.      The secrecy of the Clipper/Skipjack algorithm reduces public trust
and casts doubt on the voluntariness of the whole system
        Many parties have already questioned the need for a secret
algorithm, especially given the existence of robust, public-domain
encryption techniques.  The most common explanation given for use of a
secret algorithm is the need to prevent users from bypassing the key escrow
system proposed along with the Clipper Chip.  Clipper has always been
presented by the Administration as a voluntary option.  But if the system
is truly voluntary, why go to such lengths to ensure compliance with the
escrow procedure? <p>

C       Current plans for escrow system offer inadequate technical security
and insufficient legal protections for users
        The implementation of a nationwide key escrow system is clearly a
complex task.  But preliminary plans available already indicate several
areas of serious concern: <p>

1.      No legal rights for escrow users:  As currently written, the escrow
procedures insulate the government escrow agents from any legal liability
for unauthorized or negligent release of an individual's key.  This is
contrary to the very notion of an escrow system, which ordinarily would
provide a legal remedy for the depositor whose deposit is released without
authorization.  If anything, escrow agents should be subject to strict
liability for unauthorized disclosure of keys. <p>

2.      No stability in escrow rules:  The Administration has specifically
declared that it will not seek to have the escrow procedures incorporated
into legislation or official regulations.  Without formalization of rules,
users have no guaranty that subsequent administrations will follow the same
rules or offer the users the same degree of protection.  This will greatly
reduce the trust in the system. <p>

3.      Fixed Key:  A cardinal rule of computer security is that encryption
keys must be changed often.  Since the Clipper keys are locked permanently
into the chips, the keys can never be changed.  This is a major technical
weakness of the current proposal. <p>

4.      Less intrusive, more secure escrow alternatives are available: The
Clipper proposal represents only one of many possible kinds of key escrow
systems.  More security could be provided by having more than two escrow
agents.  And, in order to increase public trust, some or all of these
agents could be non-governmental agencies, with the traditional fiduciary
duties of an escrow agent. <p>

D.      Escrow Systems Threaten Fundamental Constitutional Values
        The Administration, Congress, and the public ought to have the
opportunity to consider the implications of limitations on cryptography
from a constitutional perspective.  A delicate balance between
constitutional privacy rights and the needs of law enforcement has been
crafted over the history of this country.  We must act carefully as we face
the constitutional challenges posed by new communication technologies.
        Unraveling the current encryption policy tangle must begin with one
threshold question: will there come a day when the federal government
controls the domestic use of encryption through mandated key escrow schemes
or outright prohibitions against the use of particular encryption
technologies?  Is Clipper the first step in this direction?  A mandatory
encryption regime raises profound constitutional questions.
        In the era where people work for "virtual corporations" and conduct
personal and political lives in "cyberspace," the distinction between
communication of information and storage of information is increasingly
vague.  The organization in which one works may constitute a single virtual
space, but be physically dispersed.  So, the papers and files of the
organization or individual may be moved within the organization by means of
telecommunications technology.  Instantaneous access to encryption keys,
without prior notice to the communicating parties, may well constitute a
secret search, if the target is a virtual corporation or an individual
whose "papers" are physically dispersed.
        Wiretapping and other electronic surveillance has always been
recognized as an exception to the fundamental Fourth Amendment prohibition
against secret searches.  Even with a valid search warrant, law enforcement
agents must "knock and announce" their intent to search a premises before
proceeding.  Failure to do so violates the Fourth Amendment.  Until now,
the law of search and seizure has made a sharp distinction between, on the
one hand, seizures of papers and other items in a person's physical
possession, and on the other hand, wiretapping of communications.  Seizure
of papers or personal effects must be conducted with the owner's knowledge,
upon presentation of a search warrant.  Only in the exceptional case of
wiretapping, may a person's privacy be invaded by law enforcement without
simultaneously informing that person.
        Proposals to regulate the use of cryptography for the sake of law
enforcement efficiency should be viewed carefully in the centuries old
tradition of privacy protection. <p>

E.      Voluntary escrow system will not meet law enforcement needs
        Finally, despite all of the troubling aspects of the Clipper
proposal, it is by no means clear that it will even solve the problems that
law enforcement has identified.  The major stated rationale for government
intervention in the domestic encryption arena is to ensure that law
enforcement has access to criminal communications, even if they are
encrypted.  Yet, a voluntary scheme seems inadequate to meet this goal.
Criminals who seek to avoid interception and decryption of their
communications would simply use another system, free from escrow
provisions.  Unless a government-proposed encryption scheme is mandatory,
it would fail to achieve its primary law enforcement purpose.  In a
voluntary regime, only the law-abiding would use the escrow system. <p>

III.    Recent policy developments indicate that Administration policy is
bad for the NII, contrary to the Computer Security Act, and requires
Congressional oversight
        Along with the Clipper Chip proposal, the Administration announced
a comprehensive review of cryptography and privacy policy.  Almost
immediately after the Clipper announcement, the Digital Privacy and
Security Working Group began discussions with the Administration on issues
raised by the Clipper proposal and by cryptography in general.
Unfortunately, this dialogue has been largely one-sided.  EFF and many
other groups have provided extensive input to the Administration, yet the
Administration has not reciprocated -- the promised policy report has not
been forthcoming.  Moreover, the National Security Agency and the Federal
Bureau of Investigation are proceeding unilaterally to implement their own
goals in this critical policy area.
        Allowing these agencies to proceed unilaterally would be a grave
mistake. As this subcommittee is well aware, the Computer Security Act of
1987 clearly established that neither military nor law enforcement agencies
are the proper protectors of personal privacy.  When considering the law,
Congress asked, "whether it is proper for a super-secret agency [the NSA]
that operates without public scrutiny to involve itself in domestic
activities...?"  The answer was a clear "no."  Recent Administration
announcements regarding the Clipper Chip suggest that the principle
established in the 1987 Act has been circumvented.
        As important as the principle of civilian control was in 1987, it
is even more critical today.  The more individuals around the country come
to depend on secure communications to protect their privacy, the more
important it is to conduct privacy and security policy dialogues in public,
civilian forums.
        The NII can grow into the kind of critical, national resource which
this Administration seeks to promote only if major changes in current
cryptography and privacy policy.  In the absence of such changes, digital
technology will continue to rapidly render our commercial activities and
communications -- and, indeed, much of our personal lives -- open to
scrutiny by strangers.  The Electronic Frontier Foundation believes that
Americans must be allowed access to the cryptographic tools necessary to
protect their own privacy.
        We had hoped that the Administration was committed to making these
changes, but several recent developments lead us to fear that the effort
has been abandoned, leaving individual agencies to pursue their own policy
agendas instead of being guided by a comprehensive policy.  The following
issues concern us: <p>

*       Delayed Cryptography Policy ReportThe policy analysis called for
along with the April 16, 1993 Presidential Decision Directive has not been
released, though it was promised to have been completed by early fall of
1993.  We had hoped that this report would be the basis for public dialogue
on the important privacy, competitiveness, and law enforcement issues
raised by cryptography policy.  To date, none of the Administration's
policy rationale has been revealed to the public, despite the fact that
agencies in the Executive Branch are proceeding with their own plan <p>

*       Escrowed Encryption Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS)
approved against overwhelming weight of public commentsThe Presidential
Decision Directive also called for consideration of a Federal Information
Processing Standard (FIPS) for key-escrow encryption systems.  This process
was to have been one of several forums whereby those concerned about the
proposed key-escrow system could voice opinions.  EFF, as well as over 225
of our individual members, raised a number of serious concerns about the
draft FIPS in September of this 1993.  EFF expressed its opposition to
government implementation of key-escrow systems as proposed.  We continue
to oppose the deployment of Skipjack family escrow encryption systems both
because they violate fundamental First, Fourth, and Fifth amendment
principles, and because they fail to offer users adequate security and
flexibility.Despite overwhelming opposition from over 300 commenters, the
Department of Commerce recently approved FIPS 185. <p>

*       Large-Scale Skipjack Deployment AnnouncedAt the December 9, 1993
meeting of the Computer Systems Security and Privacy Advisory Board, an NSA
official announced plans to deploy from 10,000 to 70,000 Skipjack devices
in the Defense Messaging System in the near future.  The exact size of the
order was said to be dependent only on budget constraints.  The
Administration is on record in the national press promising that no
large-scale Skipjack deployment would occur until a final report of the
Administration Task Force was complete.  Ten thousand units was set as the
upper limit of initial deployment.  Skipjack deployment at the level
planned in the Defense Messaging System circumvents both the FIPS notice
and comments process which has been left in a state of limbo, as well as
the Administration's promise of a comprehensive policy framework. 
*       New FBI Digital Telephony Legislation ProposedThe FBI recently
proposed a new "Digital Telephony" bill.  After initial analysis, we
strongly oppose the bill, which would require all common carriers to
construct their networks to deliver to law enforcement agencies, in real
time, both the contents of all communications on their networks and the
"signaling" or transactional information. <p>

In short, the bill lays the groundwork for turning the National
Information Infrastructure into a nation-wide surveillance system, to be
used by law enforcement with few technical or legal safeguards.  This image
is not hyperbole, but a real assessment of the power of the technology and
inadequacy of current legal and technical privacy protections for users of
communications networks. <p>

Although the FBI suggests that the bill is primarily designed to
maintain status quo wiretap capability in the face of technological
changes, in fact, it seeks vast new surveillance and monitoring tools. <p>

Lengthy delays on the promised policy report, along with these
unilateral steps toward Clipper/Skipjack deployment, lead us to believe
that Administration policy is stalled by the Cold War-era national security
concerns that have characterized cryptography policy for the last several
decades.
        EFF believes that it would be a disastrous error to allow national
information policy -- now a critical component of domestic policy -- to be
dictated solely by backward-looking national-security priorities and
unsubstantiated law-enforcement claims.  The directions set by this
Administration will have a major impact on privacy, information security,
and the fundamental relationship between the government and individual
autonomy.  This is why the Administration must take action--and do so
before the aforementioned agencies proceed further--to ensure that
cryptography policy is restructured to serve the interests of privacy and
security in the National Information Infrastructure. We still believe the
Administration can play the leadership role it was meant to play in shaping
this policy. If it does not, the potential of the NII, and of fundamental
civil liberties in the information age, will be threatened. <p>

IV.     Congressional oversight of cryptography &amp; privacy policy is
urgently needed to right the balance between privacy, competitiveness &amp; law
enforcement needs <p>

All participants in this debate recognize that the need for privacy
and security is real, and that new technologies pose real challenges for
law enforcement and national security operations.  However, the solutions
now on the table cripple the NII, pose grave threats to privacy, and fail
to even meet law enforcement objectives.  In our judgment, the
Administration has failed, thus far, to articulate a comprehensive set of
policies which will advance the goals upon which we all agree.
        Congress must act now to ensure that cryptography policy is
developed in the context of the broader goal of promoting the development
of an advanced, interoperable, secure, information infrastructure.
        In order to meet the privacy and security needs of the growing
infrastructure, Congress should seek a set of public policies which promote
the widespread availability of cryptographic systems according to the
following criteria: <p>

*       Use Voluntary Standards to Promote Innovation and Meet Diverse
Needs: The National Information Infrastructure stretches to encompass
devices as diverse as super computers, handheld personal digital assistants
and other wireless communications devices, and plain old telephones.
Communication will be carried over copper wires, fiber optic cables, and
satellite links.  The users of the infrastructure will range from
elementary school children to federal agencies.  Encryption standards must
be allowed to develop flexibly to meet the wide-ranging needs all
components of the NII.  In its IITF Report, the Administration finds that <p>

standards also must be compatible with the large installed base of
communications technologies, and flexible and adaptable enough to meet user
needs at affordable costs. [AA, 9]
The diverse uses of the NII require that any standard which the government
seeks to promote as a broadly deployed solution should be implementable in
software as well as hardware and based on widely available algorithms. <p>

*       Develop Trusted Algorithms and End-to-End Security:  Assuring
current and future users of the NII that their communications are secure
and their privacy is protected is a critical task.  This means that the
underlying algorithms adopted must have a high level of public trust and
the overall systems put in place must be secure. <p>

*       Encourage National and International Interoperability:  The promise
of the NII is seamless national and international communications of all
types.  Any cryptographic standard offered for widespread use must allow US
corporations and individuals to function as part of the global economy and
global communications infrastructure. <p>

*       Seek Reasonable Cooperation with Law Enforcement and National
Security Needs:  New technologies pose new challenges to law enforcement
and national security surveillance activities.  American industry is
committed to working with law enforcement to help meet its legitimate
surveillance needs, but the development of the NII should not be stalled on
this account. <p>

*       Promote Constitutional Rights of Privacy and Adhere to Traditional
Fourth Amendment Search and Seizure Rules:  New technology can either be a
threat or an aid to protection of fundamental privacy rights.  Government
policy should promote technologies which enable individuals to protect
their privacy and be sure that those technologies are governed by laws
which respect the long history of constitutional search and seizure
restraints. <p>

*       Maintain Civilian Control over Public Computer and Communications
Security:  In accordance with the Computer Security Act of 1987,
development of security and privacy standards should be directed by the
civilian <p>

V.      Conclusion
        Among the most important roles that the federal government has in
NII deployment are setting standards and guaranteeing privacy and security.
Without adequate security and privacy, the NII will never realize it
economic or social potential.  Cryptography policy must, of course, take
into account the needs of law enforcement and national security agencies,
but cannot be driven by these concerns alone.  The Working Group, along
with other industry and public interest organizations, is committed to
working with the Administration to solving the privacy and security
questions raised by the growing NII.  This must be done based on the
principles of voluntary standards, promotion of innovation, concern for law
enforcement needs, and protection of constitutional rights of privacy.
*       *       *       *       * <p>

50 percent increase in electronic surveillance in 1993 <p>

Date: Fri, 13 May 1994 09:18:42 -0400

Subject: 50 percent increase in electronic surveillance in 1993 <p>

I thought you might find this AP clipping of interest, especially
in the context of the pro-Clipper argument that there's really minimal
eavesdropping going on, despite all the static. <p>

AP 05/12 11:10 EDT V0936 <p>

Copyright 1994. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. <p>

WASHINGTON (AP) -- A nearly 50 percent increase in wiretaps and microphones
aimed at suspected drug traffickers pushed federal eavesdropping to a record
high during the first year of the Clinton administration.
   Overall, electronic monitoring by federal agents grew by almost a third in
1993, the largest increase in a decade, according to figures released by the
Administrative Office for U.S. Courts.
   No single event produced the 1993 increase, federal officials say. Rather,
they attribute it to progress in a decade-long effort to concentrate
investigations on the kingpins of sophisticated drug rings.
   "It takes time to get something in place in any federal agency," said Robert
C. Bonner, who stepped down as head of the Drug Enforcement Administration in
November 1993. "It's like turning a battleship."
   Attorney General Janet Reno said today that drug investigators complained to
her last year that some U.S. attorney's offices had few prosecutors experienced
in wiretap cases. "We've tried to increase the training so people with wiretap
expertise are available throughout the country," she said. "That may be one of
the reasons for the increase."
   Federal court orders approving telephone taps or electronic bugs for
narcotics investigations grew to 333 from 226 the year before.
   The 1993 total of 450 federal surveillance orders was the highest since a
1968 law authorized federal wiretapping. They represented a 32.4 percent
increase over the 340 orders in 1992.
   The last year with a bigger increase in total federal eavesdropping orders
was 1984, when there were 289, or 38.9 percent more than the 208 a year earlier.
Drug enforcement also was the engine then: 1984 was the first full year of work
for a nationwide network of organized crime drug enforcement task forces,
combining the efforts of 11 federal offices.
   "Agents are learning they can use wiretaps effectively in these cases so the
FBI and DEA are doing more and more," said Frederick Hess, head of the Justice
Department office that reviews all federal requests to courts for surveillance
orders.
   Somewhat bigger jumps occur in years when more agents finish long-term
investigations at the same time and begin new ones, Hess added.
   DEA once had "a reputation of concentrating on street-level buy-bust
operations," Bonner said. By late 1991 Bonner formulated and in 1992-3
implemented a strategy of focusing on kingpins of major regional and
international cocaine and heroin rings.
   By late 1993, DEA was operating four times as many drug wiretaps as the FBI
and for first time had more active drug wiretaps than the FBI had in all types
of criminal investigations, Bonner said.
   The FBI, which pioneered investigative attacks on the leadership of criminal
enterprises, particularly with electronic surveillance, brought that expertise
to its first drug investigations in the early 1980s.
   "The DEA and FBI have moved away from drug interdiction because we have more
impact through wiretap and undercover techniques that keep us more informed of
the inner workings of the organizations," said Tom Martin, who heads an FBI
headquarters unit that coordinates drug task forces.
   Among surveillances completed in 1993, a microphone placed inside a New
Jersey lawyer's office in a racketeering case operated for 435 days, overheard
65 people and cost the government $517,673 -- the year's longest and most
expensive federal eavesdropping.
   Hess said it was in the Camden, N.J., office of Salvatore Avena, lawyer to
reputed Philadelphia mob boss John Stanfa. Stanfa, Avena and 22 others were
indicted on racketeering-related charges March 17. The government told the court
the law office was used for meetings, at which the murder of rivals was planned,
"to evade electronic surveillance by fraudulently creating the appearance that
these were legally proper meetings."
   The microphone picked up Avena telling Stanfa in a demonstration of loyalty,
"If you want me to put my brains in the toilet, I'll put my brains in the
toilet," prosecutors said.
   There was a 10 percent decrease in electronic surveillance by state and local
law officers during 1993, from 579 to 526. New York, with 204 state court
orders, New Jersey, with 121, and Pennsylvania, with 61, accounted for 73
percent of the state surveillances. <p>

UK's Independent on Clipper as published in the Daily	Yomiuri [sent by Japanese IPer] <p>

Posted-Date: Fri, 13 May 1994 00:35:31 -0400 <p>

from "View from Europe: The Independent", supplement to The Daily
Yomiuri, 5/13/94, page 11a: <p>

SPOOKS ALL SET TO HACK IT ON THE SUPERHIGHWAY <p>

-- Europe fears US plans to let spy agencies monitor electronic mail
for criminial content will be open to abuse, writes LEONARD DOYLE <p>

A row is brewing between Europe and America over US plans to
allow intelligence agencies to monitor information on computer
channels.
        Washington believes E-mail -- electronic messages travelling
at the speed of light on the information superhighway -- is a conduit
for messages without fear of detection.
        The US plan for a Clipper chip, which lets intelligence
agencies crack encrypted computer messages, has raised fears among
European business that sensitive information would no longer be secret
if it were vetted by the CIA, the FBI, or GCHQ, the British
Government's eavesdropping facility.
        E-mail is rapidly taking over from "snail-mail," as postal
services are dismissively known.
        There are an estimated 20 million users on the worldwide web
of computer networks known as Internet.  But in 10 years it is
predicted 80 percent of trade information will be sent by this method.
        The Clinton administration, concerned that terrorists,
money-launderers, and drug dealers will use E-mail to send encrypted
information to associates, wants to outlaw the use of private
encruption on international computer networks.
        The global censorship plan has run up against opposition from
European and American businesses that use encryption to send sensitive
information.
        In a position paper to a committee of European Union
intelligence experts, which has been obtained by the Independent, the
European organisation representing users of computer security has
rejected the Clinton initiative as "totally unacceptable."
        The statement by the Information Security Business Advisory
Group (Ibag) warns European governments to ignore overtures from the
US government aimed at restricting access to the information
superhighway to users who use encryption that the government agencies
can decode.
        The European position is that "industry needs to know when its
sensitive data has been compromised [by the security services or
others]" and that the US eavesdropping initiative will greatly reduce
the benefits of the information superhighway.  Companies "will be
restricted to a very restricted list of 'approved' algorithms
[encryption methods]" greatly adding to business costs and making
international cooperation difficult.
        Ibag recently informed the senior officials group on
information security that the planned US-style restrictions, or the
even stricter French system under which those using cyphers must
disclose the keys to the authorities, are "totally unacceptable" to
industry.
        The European group has proposed that companies deposit the
keys to their encryption cyphers with "trusted third parties" rather
than with governments.  With this system, when intelligence agencies
want to tap messages, the company will have to be notified.
        Chriss Sund, a computer-security expert, said companies faced
real dangers of economic espionage by governments.
        "There was a general instinct among companies to distrust the
French," he said, who he claimed used government controls on
encryption "to their advantage."
        Stephen Dorril, an expert on the intelligence services, claims
that the US proposal is designed to facilitate economic espionage.
        GCHQ, which has been cooperating hand-in-glove with the US for
the past 50 years, finds itself caught in the middle of this EU-US
dispute.  Britain will eventually have to square cooperation on
intelligence and encryption across the Atlantic with the demands of
its European partners.
        Under the US initiative, use of computer or voice encruption
which cannot readily be hacked into by the secruity services of
cooperating governments will be deemed suspcious and worthy of
surveillance.
        These users will be denied access to the information
superhighway.  The US has decided to replace private encryption with
the Clipper chip.  This enables government agencies to listen in on
conversations and intecept and decode data flows at will.  How
European governments intend to tackle the problem of terrorists and
other criminals using encruption to stay ahead of the law is not
known, but there has traditionally been a close working relationship
between the National Security Agency in the US and the GCHQ in
Britain.
        The clash over encryption could have serious implications for
the development of the information superhighway, which has been hailed
in Brussels and Washington as a way of increasing competitivesness and
delivering a boost to the economics of the industrialised world.
        If European businesses are blocked from using the US
information superhighway because they will not bow to US pressure, the
EU may be forced to develop its own independent system, adding to the
cost and hastening the division of the world into three rival trading
blocs, the US, the EU, and Asia. <p>

Sidebars: <p>

* How E-mail helps criminals avoid detection <p>

- Today when a user transmits messges in code on the Internet, the
international computer network, government intelligence services
cannot listen in. <p>

- Modern encryption cannot be cracked but if users are forced to use
the Clipper chip, intelligence services could then eavesdrop. <p>

- The US has introduce the Clipper chip, a way of encrypting
messages while allowing government intelligence services access to
transmissions.  This is possible through a "key" used to encrypt the
message.  The government holds a duplicate key that allows it to
decode transmissions. <p>

- Europe is opposed to the Clipper chip because it fears that the
FBI or CIA could target European businesses.  A suggested alternative
is that the "keys" to coded messages should be deposited with a
non-government trusted third party. <p>

50 percent increase in electronic surveillance in 1993 <p>

Subject: 50 percent increase in electronic surveillance in 1993 <p>

I thought you might find this AP clipping of interest, especially
in the context of the pro-Clipper argument that there's really minimal
eavesdropping going on, despite all the static. <p>

AP 05/12 11:10 EDT V0936 <p>

WASHINGTON (AP) -- A nearly 50 percent increase in wiretaps and microphones
aimed at suspected drug traffickers pushed federal eavesdropping to a record
high during the first year of the Clinton administration.
   Overall, electronic monitoring by federal agents grew by almost a third in
1993, the largest increase in a decade, according to figures released by the
Administrative Office for U.S. Courts.
   No single event produced the 1993 increase, federal officials say. Rather,
they attribute it to progress in a decade-long effort to concentrate
investigations on the kingpins of sophisticated drug rings.
   "It takes time to get something in place in any federal agency," said Robert
C. Bonner, who stepped down as head of the Drug Enforcement Administration in
November 1993. "It's like turning a battleship."
   Attorney General Janet Reno said today that drug investigators complained to
her last year that some U.S. attorney's offices had few prosecutors experienced
in wiretap cases. "We've tried to increase the training so people with wiretap
expertise are available throughout the country," she said. "That may be one of
the reasons for the increase."
   Federal court orders approving telephone taps or electronic bugs for
narcotics investigations grew to 333 from 226 the year before.
   The 1993 total of 450 federal surveillance orders was the highest since a
1968 law authorized federal wiretapping. They represented a 32.4 percent
increase over the 340 orders in 1992.
   The last year with a bigger increase in total federal eavesdropping orders
was 1984, when there were 289, or 38.9 percent more than the 208 a year earlier.
Drug enforcement also was the engine then: 1984 was the first full year of work
for a nationwide network of organized crime drug enforcement task forces,
combining the efforts of 11 federal offices.
   "Agents are learning they can use wiretaps effectively in these cases so the
FBI and DEA are doing more and more," said Frederick Hess, head of the Justice
Department office that reviews all federal requests to courts for surveillance
orders.
   Somewhat bigger jumps occur in years when more agents finish long-term
investigations at the same time and begin new ones, Hess added.
   DEA once had "a reputation of concentrating on street-level buy-bust
operations," Bonner said. By late 1991 Bonner formulated and in 1992-3
implemented a strategy of focusing on kingpins of major regional and
international cocaine and heroin rings.
   By late 1993, DEA was operating four times as many drug wiretaps as the FBI
and for first time had more active drug wiretaps than the FBI had in all types
of criminal investigations, Bonner said.
   The FBI, which pioneered investigative attacks on the leadership of criminal
enterprises, particularly with electronic surveillance, brought that expertise
to its first drug investigations in the early 1980s.
   "The DEA and FBI have moved away from drug interdiction because we have more
impact through wiretap and undercover techniques that keep us more informed of
the inner workings of the organizations," said Tom Martin, who heads an FBI
headquarters unit that coordinates drug task forces.
   Among surveillances completed in 1993, a microphone placed inside a New
Jersey lawyer's office in a racketeering case operated for 435 days, overheard
65 people and cost the government $517,673 -- the year's longest and most
expensive federal eavesdropping.
   Hess said it was in the Camden, N.J., office of Salvatore Avena, lawyer to
reputed Philadelphia mob boss John Stanfa. Stanfa, Avena and 22 others were
indicted on racketeering-related charges March 17. The government told the court
the law office was used for meetings, at which the murder of rivals was planned,
"to evade electronic surveillance by fraudulently creating the appearance that
these were legally proper meetings."
   The microphone picked up Avena telling Stanfa in a demonstration of loyalty,
"If you want me to put my brains in the toilet, I'll put my brains in the
toilet," prosecutors said.
   There was a 10 percent decrease in electronic surveillance by state and local
law officers during 1993, from 579 to 526. New York, with 204 state court
orders, New Jersey, with 121, and Pennsylvania, with 61, accounted for 73
percent of the state surveillances. <p>

Jacking in from the SNAFU Port: <p>

CyberWire Dispatch // Copyright (c) 1994 // <p>

Jacking in from the SNAFU Port: <p>

Washington, DC -- Matthew Blaze never intended to make the front
page of the New York Times.  He was just doing his job:  Nose
around inside the government's most secret, most revered encryption
code to see if he could "break it." <p>

Blaze, a researcher for AT&amp;T Bell Labs, was good at this particular
job. Maybe a bit too good.  Although he didn't actually "break" the
code, he did bend the fuck out of it.  That feat landed him a front
page story in the June 9 issue of the New York Times. <p>

What Blaze found -- and quietly distributed among colleagues and
federal agencies in a draft paper -- was that design bugs in
Skipjack, the computer code that underlies the Clipper Chip
encryption scheme, can be jacked around, and re-scrambled so that
not even the Feds can crack it.  This of course defeats the whole
purpose of the Clipper Chip, which is to allow ONLY the government
the ability to eavesdrop on Clipper encoded conversations, faxes,
data transmissions, etc. <p>

What Blaze's research attacks is something called the LEAF, short for "Law
Enforcement Access Field."  The LEAF contains the secret access code needed
by law enforcement agents to decode the scrambled messages.  Blaze
discovered that the LEAF uses only a 16- bit checksum, which is a kind of
self-checking mathematical equation.  When the checksum equations match up,
the code is valid and everything's golden.  The cops get to unscramble the
conversations and another kiddie porn ring is brought to justice.  (This is
what the FBI will tell you... again and again and again and... ) <p>

But you can generate a valid 16-bit checksum in about 20 minutes,
according to those crypto-rebels that traffic the Internet's Cypherpunks
mailing list.  "A 16-bit checksum is fucking joke," one cryptographic
expert from the list told Dispatch.  "If it weren't so laughable, I'd be
insulted that all this tax payer money has gone into the R&amp;D of something
so flawed." <p>

But the New York Times got the story *wrong* or at least it gave only part
of the story.  "What the New York Times story didn't say was that the
findings... had nothing to do with the Government standard, which covers
voice, facsimile and low-speed data transmission," said an AT&amp;T spokesman.
AT&amp;T was the first company to publicly support the Clipper Chip.  A stance
that was essentially bought and paid for by the U.S. government with the
promise it would get big government contracts to sell Clipper equipped
phones to Uncle Sam, according to documents previously obtained by
Dispatch. <p>

The AT&amp;T spokesman said the "frailty" that Blaze discovered doesn't
actually exist in the Clipper Chip applications.  "Our scientists,
working with National Security Agency (NSA) scientists, were
conducting research on proposed future extensions of the standard,"
he said. <p>

Those "future extensions" are the so-called Tessera chip, intended to be
embedded in a PCMCIA credit card sized device that fits into a slot in your
computer. <p>

When the NSA trotted out its Tessera card, it invited Blaze, among others,
to review the technology, essentially becoming a beta-tester for the NSA.
No formal contract was signed, no money changed hands.  Blaze took on the
job in a volunteer role.  Using a prototype Tessera chip installed on a
PCMCIA card, he broke the damn thing. <p>

AT&amp;T claims the whole scenario is different from the Clipper because the
LEAF generated by Clipper "is a real time application... with Tessera it's
static," the spokesman said.  He said Tessera would be used to encrypt
stored communications or Email.  "And with Tessera, the user has the
ability to get at the LEAF," he said, "with Clipper, you don't." <p>

Blaze will deliver his paper, titled "Protocol Failure in the Escrowed
Encryption Standard," this fall during the Fairfax Conference.  His
findings "should be helpful" to the government "as it explores future
applications," of its new encryption technology the AT&amp;T spokesman said.
"In our view, it's better to learn a technology's limitations while there's
time to make revisions before the Government spends large sums to fund
development programs." <p>

This is an important, if subtle statement.  The Clipper Chip never
underwent this type of "beta-testing," a fact that's drawn the ire of
groups such as Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility (CPSR) and
the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF).  When the White House began to
take hits over this ugly situation, it agreed to have an independent panel
of experts review the classified code to check for any trapdoors. <p>

Those experts claim they found nothing fishy, but their report -- alas
--has also been classified, leading to further demands for openness and
accountability.  The White House is stalling, naturally. <p>

But in an apparent about face, the NSA allowed an "open" beta- testing for
Tess and -- surprise -- we find out there are bugs in the design. <p>

Okay, Pop Quiz time: Does the existence of "Blaze Bug" make you feel:  (A)
More secure about the government's claim that Clipper will only be used to
catch criminals and not spy on the citizenry. (B) Less secure about
everything you've ever been told about privacy and encryption by the
Clinton Administration.  (C)  Like this entire episode is really an
extended "Stupid Pet Tricks" gag being pulled by David Letterman. <p>

If you're still unsure about Clipper, check this quote from the AT&amp;T
spokesman:  "It's worth noting that Clipper Chip wasn't subjected to this
type of testing."  Ah-huh... any questions? <p>

The NSA is trying to downplay the news.  "Anyone interested in
circumventing law enforcement access would most likely choose simpler
alternatives," said Michael Smith, the agency's planning director, as
quoted by the New York Times.  "More difficult and time-consuming efforts,
like those discussed in the Blaze paper, are very unlikely to be employed." <p>

He's right.  Those "simpler alternatives" include everything from private
encryption methods to not using a Clipper equipped phone or fax in the
first place.  (Of course, the FBI keeps insisting that criminals won't use
any of this "simpler" knowledge because they are "dumb.") <p>

Despite the NSA's attempt to blow off these findings, the agency is
grinding its gears.  One NSA source told Dispatch that the Blaze
paper is "a major embarrassment for the program."  But the
situation is "containable" he said.  "There will be a fix." <p>

Dispatch asked if there would be a similar review of the Clipper protocols
to see if it could be jacked around like Tess.  "No comment," was all he
said. <p>

Meeks out... <p>

<TITLE>CIS590: Feb 3rd 1994</TITLE>
<H1>CIS590: Feb 3rd 1994</H1>

Guest speakers were decided upon.

Prof. Farber give an overview of the issues surrounding the Clipper
chip, and a syllabus was arrived at:
<UL>
<LI> Technology
<LI> Regulation
<LI> Export Control
<LI> Privacy Law
<LI> Privacy Application
<LI> Cultural Ethics
<LI> Intellectual Property
</UL>

<HR><H2>Technology</H2>

<UL>
<LI> Clipper: what is involved
<LI> RSA and Diffie-Hellman public key systems
     <UL>
     <LI> described more fully in <A HREF="reading.66.txt">the PGP
          documentation</A>.
     </UL>
<LI> DES, the Data Encryption Standard
<LI> Public Domain Systems
<LI> Digital Signature Standard
<LI> Spread Spectrum
     <UL>
     <LI> A signal is broken up and redundantly distributed across
	  certain channels in a spectrum.  A receiving unit can
	  reassemble the message if it knows which channels to listen
	  to.  This isn't exactly encryption but works in the same
	  spirit.  Nontrivial to tap.
     <LI> Used in cordless phone systems, etc.
     </UL>
</UL>

<HR><H2>Regulation of Cryptography</H2>

<UL>
<LI> National (within USA)
     <UL>
     <LI> there may be weak controls during wartime, but there is nothing
	  very strong.
     </UL>
<LI> International (non USA)
     <UL>
     <LI> in France, any use of cryptography is illegal, save whichever
	  schemes are approved by the government, and for which a set of
	  decoding keys are registered with and held by the government.
     </UL>
</UL>

<HR><H2>Export Control</H2>

<UL>
<LI> It is illegal in the USA to export any cryptography technology,
     except some really weak stuff.  [I believe this is under a
     munitions act. -meng]
<LI> also, there are export contorls on high performance electronics:
     the Pentium qualifies as high performance.
<LI> COCOM is a group of largely Western governments agreeing not to
     sell technology to hostile countries.
<LI> <B>Import</B> controls on the other hand are much weaker.  One
     may import stuff which one may not export.
<LI> As a result, USA companies are in a bad situation commercially.
     It makes no sense to create two sets of software, one which may
     be exported, the other for USA use only.
<LI> Export controls are well nigh impossible to implement: consider
     the ease of FTP.
</UL>

<HR><H2>Privacy Law</H2>

There are several overlapping levels and areas in which privacy laws
apply.  Note that in fields as new as this, the law is what courts
decide, not what is written.  Relevant legislation are the Electronic
Communication Privacy Act, and the Electronic Communicaton Mail Act.
The former is worded to send a clear message: government employees
charged under the Act may <B>not</B> use federal funds to help defend
their cases.  This is significant because normally the Justice
Department helps defray costs.  Here, one is left to hang.

<UL>
<LI> Constitutional
<UL>
<LI> Nothing in the Constution mentions the right to privacy.
     <LI> Relevant Amendments, however, do have a bearing:
	  <UL>
	  <LI> First Amendment: the right to free speech would imply
	       that one has also the right to the converse: the right
	       to not be overheard.
	  <LI> Fourth Amendment: illegal search and seizure could
	       conceivably extend to information.
	  <LI> Fifth Amendment: the right not to incriminate oneself.
	  </UL>
     </UL>
<LI> State
<LI> Federal
</UL>

<HR><H2>Privacy Application</H2>

There are a number of distinct places in which different laws and
standards apply.  Three are of interest:

<UL>
<LI> Home.  Maximal privacy is expected.
<LI> Workplace.  Less privacy.  There are two subcases:
     <UL>
     <LI> Real workplaces, in a job setting.  Does the employer have the
	  right to monitor employee communication?  "Common sense" says no,
	  but courts may differ.  The computer is owned by the company.
     <LI> Schools.  Universities, unlike high schools and elementary
	  schools, do not have the right of "loco parentis".  Students are
	  paying customers, and part of what they pay for is an email account.
     </UL>
<LI> Public Spaces.  Very little privacy can be expected.
</UL>

<HR><H2>Cultural Ethics</H2>

Unlike the rapid pace of case law, popular opinion is very slow to
change.  A study of attitudes in American history is relevant.

<HR><H2>Intellectual Property</H2>

What is ownership?  In cyberspace, vessels of value are wholly
intangible.  <A HREF="reading.063.html">John Perry Barlow's article</A>
is very relevant to this issue.

<HR><H2>Miscellaneous Topics</H2>

<H3>Economics</H3>

At least three economic issues are relevant:
<UL>
<LI> Cost to maintain the system
<LI> Cost to install the chip
<LI> Cost of using the system
</UL>

Migration Dialogue is a not-for-profit organization that prepares and distributes timely and unbiased information on international migration, sponsors an annual three-day seminar for American and European opinion leaders to consider migration issues, and maintains a list of speakers willing to discuss migration issues.<p>

<ul>
<li>Migration Briefs are 50 to 75 page monographs that explore the tradeoffs inherent in making decisions about migration.  Each helps readers to think through issues such as the linkages between population growth and immigration, refugees and foreign policy, and migration and the environment.<p>

Integration Program<p></center></h3>

The Center for German and European Studies, a systemwide program housed on the
UC-Berkeley campus, in January 1994 supported the creation of the Comparative
Immigration and Integration Program to promote interdisciplinary and comparative
research on immigration and integration issues facing industrial democracies in
North America and Europe.  

The CGES-CIIP each year funds 10 to 20 faculty researchers, and 10 to 20
graduate student projects, and holds two to three research work shops.  UC
faculty and graduate students interested in comparative migration issues are
invited to participate in the CIIP's research seminars and in the annual RFP
competition; both are announced in Migration News.

For further information, please contact Gia White at the Center for German and
European Studies-- gia@uclink.berkeley.edu

</Td> <Td valign=top ><h3><center>California Policy Seminar</center><p></h3>

The California Policy Seminar established an Immigration Policy Panel co-chaired
by Manuel Garcia y Griego (UCI) and Philip Martin (UCD) in 1995 to help policy
makers and opinion leaders understand how immigration and integration issues are
affecting California's economy, politics, and society.  The panel supports
research, the preparation of option papers, and holds seminars on immigration
issues in Sacramento for state employees who deal with immigration and
integration issues.

Immigration, Naturalization Up in FY96
</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<h2>MIGRATION NEWS.<br>
Vol. 4, No. 1  January, 1997.<p>

North America.<p>

Immigration, Naturalization Up in FY96</h2>
<ul>
<p>
There were 720,461 people admitted as immigrants in FY95, down 10
percent from 804,416 in FY94; an estimated one million people were admitted as
immigrants in FY96.  Much of the drop in FY95 was due to INS problems in
implementing the so-called 245i adjustment procedure under which persons in the
US can adjust their status to become immigrants rather than return to their
countries of citizenship before immigrating to the US.<p>
The INS argued in March 1996, in support of those in Congress who wanted to
consider legal and illegal immigration separately, that there was no need to
reduce legal immigration, since immigration levels were already falling.  In
May 1996, Congressional leaders of immigration subcommittees accused the INS of
misleading the public about future immigration levels when releasing the FY95
figures (MN, June 1996).<p>
The US government anticipates the arrival of 675,000 immigrants each year,
including 480,000 family unification, 140,000 economic/employment-based and
55,000 diversity immigrants.  In addition, there also are refugees, the number
being determined each year by the President in consultation with Congress.
<p>
Between 1986 and 1995, about 12 million immigrants were admitted legally to
the US--some were in the US earlier and had their status legalized in this
period.  The previous peak period of immigration was 1905-1914, when 10 million
immigrants arrived.<p>
Most immigrants over the past 10 years--66 percent--were women and children
and most of the adults were unskilled or had less than a high school education.
About 75 percent of the immigrants were from Asian, Latin American or Caribbean
countries and 66 percent settled in California, New York, Texas, Florida,
Illinois and New Jersey.<p>
About 2.7 million unauthorized immigrants were legalized.  At least three
million additional illegal aliens entered the US and stayed.<p>
A December 1996 poll by the Wall Street Journal/NBC News reported that 72
percent of respondents would like to see immigration reduced.  A similar
question in 1965 found that 33 percent of Americans wanted to reduce
immigration.<p>
The INS in December released detailed immigration data for FY95 and
reported that 166,482 immigrants intended to settle in California, down from
208,498 in FY94.  About 12 percent of US immigrants in FY95, and 21 percent of
California immigrants, were from Mexico.<p>
Some 1.3 million foreigners applied to become naturalized US citizens in
FY96 and 1.1 million became US citizens.  The INS estimates that 1.8 million
foreigners may apply for naturalization in FY97.<p>
In November 1995, the INS changed its naturalization procedures.  INS now
requires that, before naturalization, the FBI certify that the fingerprints
submitted by the applicant are not associated with any crimes in the US.
Previously, the INS merely assumed that there was no US crime if the FBI did
not produce evidence to the contrary within 120 days.  <p>
The time between applying for naturalization and being sworn in as a US
citizen is usually less than six months.  The tighter clearance procedure has
slowed the process, however, and some advocates have complained that welfare
benefits may be delayed as a result.  <p>
INS workers in Miami, where 140,000 persons were naturalized in FY96,
charged that 10,000 foreigners were naturalized without FBI fingerprint checks.
The INS workers charged that swearing-in ceremonies were sometimes scheduled
for applicants one week after their initial INS interviews, so that there was
no time for background checks.<p>
Because the criminal checks may have been faulty, the INS, under the
supervision of accounting firm KPMG Peat Marwick, is reviewing all citizenship
cases completed in FY96.<p>
The Justice Department rejected a November 1, 1996 request to appoint an
independent prosecutor to investigate Citizenship USA.<p>
Acting on its own, the INS has begun to revoke the citizenship of criminals
who were naturalized.  Under new regulations that have not yet been tested in
court, the INS, without judicial proceedings, is denaturalizing persons who
obtained citizenship by, for example, concealing criminal convictions.  Some
70,000 of the 1.1 million persons naturalized in FY96 had arrest records, but
an arrest does not automatically disqualify an alien for naturalization.<p>
The Justice Department in December released $495 million to states as
reimbursement for the cost of incarcerating illegal aliens, representing 60
percent of the $825 requested by state and local governments.  <p>

Ethnic Voting in 1996</h2>
<ul>

<p>
Recently-naturalized US citizens voted overwhelmingly for Clinton in
November 1996.  An estimated 71 percent of Hispanics voted for Clinton.<p>
In California, Texas and Arizona, Latinos voted for Clinton in higher
percentages than the general population of those states.  Only in tipping
Arizona to Clinton, however, does the Latino vote appear to have made a
critical difference.  In Florida, Dole won the Latino vote, but Clinton won the
state.<p>
Most newly naturalized Hispanics--about 61 percent in one survey--are
registered Democrats.  Once registered as Democrats, Latinos rarely switch
party affiliation.  Nine percent of US Latinos registered as Republicans and 30
percent as Independents.  However, it should be noted that younger Hispanics in
the southwest are increasingly registering as Republicans.<p>
On December 27, 1996, the Los Angeles Times reported that at least 19
non-US citizens voted in the close race between Republican Robert K. Dornan and
Democrat Loretta Sanchez for a House seat.  Sanchez won by 984 votes.  The
Sanchez victory is often cited as evidence of the growing importance of the
Hispanic vote.  Dornan has filed a complaint with the House of Representatives
contesting the results of the election.<p>
It is a felony under California law for a non-US citizen to vote or
register to vote.  Those who acknowledged voting before being sworn in as US
citizens were taking naturalization classes at Hermanda Mexicana Nacional, a
Santa Ana organization that registered least 916 people to vote, most just
before the November 5, 1996 election.  <p>
If an applicant brings evidence of passing an English and civics class from
an organization such as Hermanda, the INS examiner normally does not ask many
civics questions during the mandatory interview.  INS examiners, who conducted
some interviews in the Hermanda office, immediately tell the applicant whether
they passed the test, but also tell applicants they are not citizens until they
are sworn in.  Voter registration is done on the honor system.<p>
About 53 percent of Asian-Pacific voters voted for Clinton and 40 percent
for Dole.  About 60 percent of the Asian-Americans were born abroad.<p>
Some spokesman for ethnic and immigrant rights organizations say that
immigration restrictions, welfare cuts and Proposition 209 woke a sleeping
giant of Hispanic and Asian voters.  For most voters, however, immigration was
not the decisive factor in determining how to vote.  A poll of 1,200 US voters
found that fewer than one percent based their vote on the candidates'
immigration position.  <p>
One indirect effect of immigration that may have influenced some election
outcomes is the tendency of native-born whites to move away from
high-immigration areas.  Some observers speculate, for example, that Jesse
Helms (R-NC) won re-election to the US Senate in part because of the influx of
whites from New York and Florida.<p>

Expanding Access to Asylum

<h2>MIGRATION NEWS.<br>
Vol. 4, No. 1  January, 1997.<p>

North America.<p>

Expanding Access to Asylum</h2>
<ul>

<p>
Since 1994, when the US recognized persecution because of
homosexuality as grounds for asylum, some 60 foreigners have been given asylum
in the US on that basis.  US interest groups have lobbied to extend asylum
eligibility to women trying to escape forcible subjugation at the hands of
male-dominated Islamic societies and to Chinese men and women who oppose their
government's one-child-per-family policy.<p>
In October 1995, a New York immigration judge granted asylum to a
heterosexual man from Togo on the grounds of his HIV infection and AIDS-related
illnesses.  The man entered the US in April 1991, applied for political asylum
and was rejected and then applied for asylum claiming persecution as a member
of a "particular social group"-- HIV-infected persons in Togo and the Ivory
Coast.  An HIV-positive man from Brazil was granted asylum by an immigration
judge in San Francisco in August, 1996.<p>
In January 1996, a presidential commission recommended that HIV infection
be made a basis for asylum in the US.  However, a 1993 law specifically bars
aliens with HIV or AIDS from entering the United States.  Rep. Lamar S. Smith
(R-TX), chairman of the House Judiciary subcommittee on immigration, says that
granting asylum based on homosexuality, as some immigration judges have been
doing, is "stretching the law."  Granting asylum on the basis of HIV infection
is, according to Smith, "a violation of the law."<p>
A Russian lesbian is asking a federal appeals court to grant her asylum in
the US, claiming that she faces institutionalization and electroshock therapy
if she returns home.  According to her lawyer, this is the first time a federal
appeals court will consider sexual orientation as a basis for asylum.<p>
Other countries that grant asylum based on sexual orientation include:
Australia, Canada, Germany, Ireland, New Zealand, Belgium, Finland, Great
Britain and Netherlands.  <p>
The 1996 immigration law includes a provision that permits up to 1,000
persons each year to be accepted as refugees because their country restricted
their child-bearing rights in the name of  population control.  Most of the 282
Chinese on the Golden Venture, which ran aground in New York Harbor on June 6,
1993, requested political asylum based on fear of forced abortion or
sterilization.  As of December 1996, 99 of those on the Golden Venture have
been returned to China, 60 are being detained, 38 are free on bond, 35 were
granted asylum, 14 minors were released to US relatives, 12 emigrated and the
others escaped or disappeared.<p>
An Armenian women persecuted for practicing transcendental meditation in
Armenia was granted asylum in the US.<p>
Refugees are screened outside the US to determine if they are persecuted in
such a way that they should be brought to the US for protection.  The number
admitted to the US each year is negotiated annually by the President and
Congress.  Asylum applicants are a self-selected group; their number depends on
how many foreigners already inside the US borders request protection and get
it.<p>
The Geneva Convention obliges signatories to protect persons fleeing
"persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race,
religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political
opinion."<p>
In Florida, the INS announced that 14 Cubans who arrived in Key West by
boat would be returned to Cuba.  Since May 1996, Cubans intercepted at sea have
been returned to Cuba, but those who made it to the US were allowed to stay
until the new INS policy went into effect on December 5, 1996.  Under the new
policy, Cubans who reach the US will be returned if the Cuban government
accepts their return.<p>
In December, the US flew to Guam 5,000 Kurds and their families who had
worked with US aid agencies in northern Iraq.  They are to eventually arrive in
the US.  The US has already evacuated 2,700 Iraqis and Kurds who worked
directly or indirectly for the US government.<p>
Britain and other European countries have refused to allow immigration by
Iraqis associated with their aid programs.<p>
On December 25, 1996, Turkish Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan announced
that Turkey was ending its involvement in the US-orchestrated effort to assist
Kurds in northern Iraq known as "Operation Provide Comfort."  Over US
objections, Turkey and Iran signed trade agreements meant to double the volume
of trade between Turkey and Iran to $2 billion per year.<p>

Implementing Welfare Changes 
</title>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<h2>MIGRATION NEWS.<br>
Vol. 4, No. 1  January, 1997.<p>

North America.<p>

Implementing Welfare Changes</h2>
<ul>

<p>
On November 27, 1996, the New York Times reported that the Clinton
administration was proposing changes in the August 1996 welfare law that would
cost about $13 billion of the $55 billion expected to be saved over six years.
Among the changes under discussion is making legal immigrants eligible for Food
Stamps.  Immigrant advocacy groups want the Clinton administration to return to
the previous system, so that legal immigrants participate in Food Stamps on the
same basis as US citizens.<p>
The Congressional Budget Office says that one million immigrants may lose
Food Stamps under the welfare law as approved in August 1996 and that it would
cost roughly $3.7 billion over six  years to restore their eligibility.<p>
The Clinton administration is implementing the new welfare law in a manner
that some in Congress say is unlawful.  The law permits legal immigrants to
receive Food Stamps after 40 quarters of US work.  The USDA is reportedly
permitting legal immigrant couples to combine their work quarters and, if the
couple has 40 quarters of US work, they are deemed eligible for Food Stamps.
<p>
Other reports say that, if an applicant for Food Stamps asserts that he has
worked 40 quarters in the US, he is granted Food Stamps.  There is not yet a
quick way for Food Stamp officials to check on applicant work
experience.<p>
The Congressional Budget Office estimated that up to 500,000 legal
immigrants could lose Supplemental Security Income payments under the new
welfare law.  A report from Massachusetts, where SSI payments average $500 per
month, says that retirement homes have organized English and civics classes to
help immigrants to naturalize.  Persons over 50 and in the US more than 15
years are allowed to take the test in their native language.<p>
Since 1979, Special Order 40 in Los Angeles has prohibited city employees,
including the Los Angeles Police Department, from reporting suspected illegal
aliens to the INS.  The policy prevents officers from asking anyone about their
immigration status, checking with the INS or turning suspects accused of minor
violations over to INS officials.<p>
However, several city council members want to change the policy in order to
deal with the violent 18th Street Gang.  As many as 60 percent of the estimated
20,000 18th Streeters in Southern California are illegal immigrants.<p>
The new welfare law requires state and local government agencies to report
suspected illegal immigrants to the Immigration and Naturalization Service
every three months.   <p>
Los Angeles-area police agencies say that many illegal immigrant suspects
flee to Mexico to avoid apprehension and that some of the worst criminals drift
back and forth between Southern California and Mexico, heading south for refuge
and are then being drawn back by the possibility of criminal profit. <p>
Beginning November 30, 1996 foreign exchange students on F-1 visas must pay
public school districts the full cost of their education before they can enter
the US, and they can remain in the US only 12 months.  Some Asian parents sent
their children-- parachute kids-- to US relatives to attend US high schools to
improve their chances of getting into the best US universities.  One 1990
estimate was that there were 40,000 parachute kids from Taiwan aged eight to 18
were living in the United States.<p>
The US State Department issues 400,000 F-I visas per year, most for
college-age students.<p>
Foreign students who attend elementary or adult schools without paying
tuition can be barred from the US for five years.<p>
<u>California.</u>  A California court on November 26, 1996 prohibited
California from declaring pregnant illegal alien women ineligible for
state-funded prenatal care.  California tried to deny benefits to illegal alien
women on December 1, 1996 under an emergency rule, but the judge ruled that
there was no emergency.  California will now go through the normal process of
issuing regulations to remove illegal alien women from the program, a process
that takes three to six months.<p>
The new welfare law requires states to get welfare recipients into jobs in
order to receive federal funds.  A study of the one million California adults
receiving AFDC payments found that almost half did not have high school
diplomas and almost half did not have cars or access to reliable
transportation.  One-third have not held a job during the past five years and
11 percent have never worked.<p>
The effort to move these largely unskilled workers into jobs has been
called the greatest challenge facing the state.  Democrats appear to favor a
package of education and training programs to pull recipients into the labor
market, while Republicans favor reducing benefits to push recipients into the
labor market.<p>
In San Francisco, where 35 percent of the residents are foreign-born,
supervisors declared the city a "safe zone" for immigrants and pledged to
encourage naturalization and to provide translation services at city meetings
upon request.  The supervisors pledged not to "discriminate on the basis of a
person's immigration status" in the provision of city services.<p>
<u>Massachusetts.</u>  Massachusetts mails welfare checks to 1,400 poor
illegal immigrant parents to support their US-born, US-citizen children and is
considering whether to turn their names over to the INS as required by law.  An
illegal alien is not eligible for the state's $93 per month adult benefit, but
can receive $486 per month to support two children.  The state assigns illegal
parents fictitious Social Security numbers for tracking purposes.<p>
Critics say that this system makes it impossible to determine if the alien
is earning money and that subsidizing even indirectly illegal immigrants
frustrates immigration controls.  Immigration advocates say that ending privacy
protections for undocumented parents will create hardships for their US-citizen
children.<p>
Massachusetts, as well as other states, are expected to give their lists of
illegal alien parents collecting welfare on behalf of their US citizen children
to the INS, but it is not clear what action, if any, the INS will take.<p>
<u>Florida/Virginia</u>. Florida plans in Spring 1997 to refer welfare
recipients to jobs once held by illegal immigrants, following Virginia's
agreement with the INS in October 1996 to try to fill jobs opened by INS raids
with welfare recipients.  Virginia expects to fill 300 to 400 jobs that pay $7
to $8 per hour in hotels, restaurants and construction but, after two months,
the INS had not yet notified Virginia of any job openings.<p>

INS: Management Woes/Enforcement</h2>
<ul>

<p>
INS field managers have accused William S. Slattery, the
third-ranking official in the INS, of improper associations with Korean garment
shop owners.  Slattery allegedly curtailed INS raids on Korean garment
factories in New York in 1993 after he attended social events with factory
owners, including a golf outing and a trip to a sauna, at the invitation of a
Korean-American businessman.<p>
Slattery says that he stopped the inspections of the Koreans garments shops
for 30 days to investigate Koreans' charges that INS agents were discriminating
against them in raiding the factories to look for illegal aliens.<p>
An INS official in New Jersey was convicted in November 1995 on corruption
charges.  In San Diego, a former Immigration and Naturalization Service
Inspector who extorted sexual favors from Mexican women was sentenced to nine
years in prison.<p>
<u>Enforcement</u>.  The INS announced that it was adding agents at the
border to prevent a "post-holiday rush" of illegal immigrants who go home to
Mexico for Christmas and return to the United States after New Year's.  In
early 1996, illegal immigrants with phony papers swamped ports of entry.<p>
In San Diego, a Mexican citizen was indicted for using authentic
immigration documents to smuggle aliens into the US.  According to the
indictment, the documents were purchased on the streets of the US and aliens
wishing to enter the US were matched with the documents on file.  Customers
were solicited and photographed as they arrived at the Tijuana bus station and
then matched with appropriate documents.<p>
In St. Louis, the INS apprehended 29 illegal immigrants from India working
at hotels and doughnut shops.  In Omaha, the INS apprehended 78 illegal
immigrants earning about $6 hourly from Deffenbaugh Industries, the city's
trash hauler; 70 returned voluntarily to Mexico.  An INS agent fired his gun at
a car fleeing the work site, which led Latino advocates to denounce the INS
under the banner "INS behavior is garbage."  The local Mexican American
Commission complained that firing a gun at a car fleeing an INS raid equates
illegal alien employment with bank robbery.<p>
In Georgia, 71 mostly Mexican construction workers working on a new
hospital were apprehended by the INS.  The raid was conducted after
Fayetteville officials complained to the INS that illegal immigrants were
working there.  They were being paid $8 to $15 per hour.  <p>
State police in Colorado tried to turn over to the INS 10 suspected illegal
aliens that it had found in a van headed to Georgia.  But the INS advised the
police that, if the vehicle was in good condition, it should be allowed to
continue to Georgia because no agents, buses, vans or jail space were available
in Colorado to handle the illegal aliens.<p>
Police report that in metropolitan Salt Lake City, 80 percent of those
arrested on drug charges are illegal immigrants.  A Latino theater group in
Salt Lake City performed a play centered on the INS scaring away the
unauthorized shepherds abiding in the field.<p>
Iowa United Methodist Church leaders urged congregations to offer sanctuary
to Hispanics threatened with deportation by the INS.  The church argues that
the INS violates the workers' human rights by staging surprise inspections of
meatpacking plants.  The church says that many of the workers were drawn to
Iowa by company promises of secure work and good wages.  There are 203,000
Methodists in 900 churches in Iowa.<p>
The owner of four Chinese restaurants in Norfolk, Virginia pleaded guilty
to hiring illegal immigrants from Mexico and Central America and was sentenced
to probation.  The owner was charged with the lowest offense in the federal
code, a Class 4 misdemeanor, which carries a maximum sentence of six months in
jail.  The owner knowingly hired illegal aliens, paid them with cash and housed
them above the restaurant.  The workers were provided room and board and $600
to $700 a month in cash for working 12-hour days, six or seven days a
week.<p>
In Los Angeles, the INS arrested three suspected smugglers and found 43
illegal immigrants in south central Los Angeles.  The 43 Mexicans had paid $400
to be smuggled through eastern San Diego county and were being held in the safe
house in Los Angeles until friends or relatives made final payments.<p>
A survey of Fresno county business leaders found that 75 percent believe
illegal immigration should be reduced.   <p>
The INS and some US attorneys are searching out and prosecuting criminal
aliens who are deported and later return to the US.  Persons deported from the
US usually sign a deportation warrant that bars a return to the United
States.<p>

Mexico: Dual Citizenship and NAFTA

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<h2>MIGRATION NEWS.<br>
Vol. 4, No. 1  January, 1997.<p>

North America.<p>

Mexico: Dual Citizenship and NAFTA</h2>
<ul>

<p>
The Mexican Senate and Chamber of Deputies approved legislation on
December 10, 1996 that would permit Mexicans who become naturalized US citizens
to retain their Mexican citizenship.  When two-thirds of Mexico's 31 state
legislatures approve dual citizenship, the new law will go into effect,
probably sometime in 1997.<p>
An estimated two million Mexican-born persons who have become naturalized
US citizens could recover their Mexican citizenship and 3.5 million other
Mexican-born persons in the US could become US citizens without losing their
Mexican citizenship.  Mexico has not yet decided how to deal with the tax and
military service obligations of citizens abroad, or whether to allow absentee
voting.<p>
Dual nationals are persons who owe allegiance to more than one country
because of birth, marriage, parentage or naturalization.  Each country develops
its own policies toward dual nationality.  <p>
The US government tolerates but does not advocate dual nationality.
<p>
A UCLA study concluded that "the impact on trade-related employment during
the first three years after NAFTA is estimated to be, at the very least, a near
zero net impact, and more likely, a moderately positive number" of about 2,900
net new US jobs since 1994.  However, there were 28,200 jobs lost to increased
imports and 31,200 jobs gained due to increased exports.<p>
Tehuixtla, Mexico, a village in the state of Puebla 140 miles southeast of
Mexico City, once again had annual visits from migrants who had moved to the
New York City area.  During most of the year, the village has about 200
residents, but at Christmas time, there are over 1,000.<p>
Remittances have financed construction of a stone church and a refurbished
hilltop shrine to the Virgin of Guadalupe.  Many migrants have built
cement-and-tile houses that are crowned with satellite-dish antennas.<p>

Canada: Immigration Goals-Reality Gap

Canada: Immigration Goals-Reality Gap</h2>
<ul>

<p>
The ruling Liberal Party government in Canada promised to keep
annual immigration at one percent of the population, which would imply about
300,000 immigrants per year, but the government in October 1995 announced that
Canada's immigration target would be 220,000 immigrants in 1997.  Canada
imposes a $975 landing fee on arriving immigrants.<p>
Canada had a national origins immigration policy and had a 99 percent
European-origin population until 1967 when immigration was opened to Asians and
Latin Americans.  In 1980, about 150,000 immigrants arrived in Canada.
Immigration fell to 80,000 per year in the mid-1980s and rose to over 250,000
per year in the early 1990s.  By the year 2000, an estimated 18 percent of
Canada's residents will be "visible minorities."<p>
Canada in November announced that it had broken up a smuggling ring that
was bringing 30 to 40 southeast Asians each month to Toronto for $30,000 to
$35,000 each.  Another gang brought Chinese immigrants to the US via Bangkok
and Hong Kong to Vancouver.  Most applied for asylum in Vancouver, then
traveled east to be smuggled into the US through an Indian reservation that
straddles the border.<p>
Canada's economy is booming, but unemployment remains at about 10
percent--the longest stretch of unemployment above nine percent since the Great
Depression.  Federal and state governments have reduced spending.  Nine of the
10 provinces--all except British Columbia--have eliminated or are on target to
eliminate their budget deficits. <p>
Vancouver has the second-largest Chinese community in North America with
three Chinese daily papers, three mainly Chinese radio stations and two TV
stations.  Chinese immigrants are sometimes accused of cutting down the trees
on their lots, which prompted the city government to permit each neighborhood
to enact its own building codes.<p>

Caribbean Migration to the US

<h2>MIGRATION NEWS.<br>
Vol. 4, No. 1  January, 1997.<p>

North America.<p>

Caribbean Migration to the US </h2>
<ul>

<p>
The 15 independent Caribbean nations, plus several dependencies,
have total population of about 36 million and some of the highest emigration
rates in the world.  The largest four sources of immigrants to the US from the
Caribbean are Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Jamaica and Haiti.<p>
There are also US-citizen migrants to the mainland US from Puerto
Rico--migrants from Caribbean islands who cannot get to the US sometimes
migrate to Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands.<p>
Caribbean island immigrants in the US are concentrated along the East
Coast, especially Miami and New York City.<p>
Some 125,000 Cubans embarked from Mariel for the US in a "freedom flotilla"
after Castro released them from the Peruvian Embassy on April 1, 1980.  About
2,500 others were added: criminals released from Cuban jails and mental
patients.<p>
Most Marielitos have integrated successfully.  Some 1,400, however, are in
US jails for crimes they committed in the US.  Incarcerating Marielitos who
committed crimes in the US has cost the US government an estimated $500 million
since 1980.<p>
In 1984, there were an estimated 2,700 hard-core Marielito criminals in the
US and the US persuaded Cuba to accept the return of 1,300 Marielitos.<p>
New York City says that several hundred Dominicans wanted for crimes
committed in the United States have returned home and the US wants some of them
extradited to the US for trial.  There are one million Dominicans in the US,
most in the New York City area.<p>
One candidate for New York City mayor, Ruth Messinger, took a trip to the
Dominican Republic and Haiti to increase her appeal to newly-naturalized US
citizens from these countries in New York.<p>
In Broward County in South Florida, there are an estimated 170,000
Hispanics, 12.5 percent of the county's residents.  In nearby Palm Beach
County, Hispanics number 95,282, or 9.8 percent of the population.
Sociologists say that in these diversified communities, Hispanic parents trying
to instill their cultural values in their children run into many pressures to
assimilate.  The pressures include the demand for conformity  to US culture and
anti-immigrant sentiment encountered by the children. <p>
Many Hispanic children end up living in two different worlds, each with a
different set of values.  Recent studies have found that children of Hispanic
parents lose that culture by the third or fourth generation.  The adjustment
patterns, says one intercultural expert, are no different from those of
European immigrants of the past century.  <p>
The church is one of the institutions which is a refuge from pressure to
conform.  Hispanics, who make up 35 percent of the parishioners in Coral
Springs, celebrate Mass in Spanish and the holidays of every Latin American
country.  <p>

Affirmative Action and Official English

Affirmative Action and Official English</h2>
<ul>

<p>
<u>Affirmative Action</u>.  On December 23, 1996, a San Francisco
federal judge blocked enforcement of Proposition 209, saying in a 67-page
opinion that there is a "strong probability" that opponents will show that the
anti-affirmative action measure is an unconstitutional violation of the equal
protection clause of the Constitution.  According to civil rights groups,
Proposition 209 violates the equal protection guarantees by preventing women
and minorities from seeking government programs to remedy discrimination that
remain available to others, including veterans and the aged, unless that can
get another constitutional amendment approved by voters.  <p>
In other words, if veterans or athletes can still have preference for jobs
or university admissions by law and regulation, the court must decide if
eliminating preferences for women and minorities in the state's constitution is
a violation of the US Constitution.<p>
<u>Official English</u>.  On December 4, 1996, the US Supreme Court heard
arguments on a case, Arizonans for Official English, to determine whether
Article 28, an amendment to Arizona's Constitution, approved by voters in 1988,
can prevent a state employee from speaking a language other than English on the
job, except when teaching English and dealing with crime and similar
emergencies (Arizonans for Official English v Arizona, 95-974).<p>
The US Supreme Court must first decide whether Arizonans for Official
English has standing to bring the case and then, whether English-speaking
requirement violates the free speech rights of state employees. <p>
The Arizona trial court found that the amendment violated the free speech
rights of a bilingual employee who chose to write her reports in Spanish.  The
Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that ruling in a 6 to 5 vote.<p>
In one precedent, Meyer v Nebraska, 1923, the Supreme Court overturned a
state law that prohibited the teaching of German even in private
schools.<p>
There are 23 states and 40 cities that have official English statutes,
although most are symbolic.  A 1995 poll found that 73 percent of US voters
want to make English the official language of the US.<p>
According to the 1990 Census of Population, 14 percent of US residents aged
five and over speak a language other than or in addition to English at home--
seven percent of those born in the United States, many of whom are the children
of immigrants, and 80 percent of the foreign-born.  Of those speaking a foreign
language, 55 percent speak Spanish.  <p>
Barry Chiswick estimates that foreign-born men of the same age and
education have about 20 percent lower earnings if they speak English poorly
than if they are more fluent.<p>

EU Proposes Common Immigration Policy 
</title>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<h2>MIGRATION NEWS.<br>
Vol. 4, No. 1  January, 1997.<p>

Europe.<p>

EU Proposes Common Immigration Policy</h2>
<ul>

<p>
The EU's Inter-Governmental Conference (IGC), which met in Dublin
December 13 and 14, discussed a 140-page Irish proposal to abolish all border
controls within the EU by 2001 and to bring immigration, asylum and visa issues
under the control of collective EU decision-making procedures, with restricted
national veto rights.  <p>
Under the Maastricht II proposal, EU nations would first eliminate border
checks on EU nationals and third-country nationals moving within the EU.  EU
nations would agree on a common list of countries whose nationals would need
visas to enter the EU and would standardize asylum and entry/residence
procedures.  The European Commission would obtain the right to implement this
common EU migration policy.<p>
The proposal would create a citizenship of the European Union, intended to
"complement and not replace national citizenship."  The proposal identifies the
freedom of citizens to live and work throughout the Union as a key EU
priority.<p>
Britain and Denmark are opposed to the replacement of national laws by an
EU immigration regime.  The UK still checks incoming EU citizens at entry ports
such as Dover despite the expectation that the European Court in Luxembourg
will rule that Britain's passport checks on other EU citizens violates the
Maastricht agreement.<p>
In Dublin, EU leaders instructed the drafters of Maastricht II to
"establish it as a clear principle that no national of a member state of the
Union may apply for asylum in another member state, taking into account
international treaties."<p>
The proposal hints at the possible incorporation into the EU treaty of the
1985 Schengen agreement.  Under that agreement, which exists independently of
the EU, checks on incoming persons have been eliminated at the borders and
airports between France, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Greece, Italy,
Luxembourg, Austria, Spain and Portugal.  Five Nordic nations that have had a
passport-free travel zone since 1958-- Finland, Denmark and Sweden, and non-EU
Norway and Iceland--joined the Schengen group December 19, 1996.<p>
In March 1996, France reinstituted border checks at its crossings with
Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands in order to enforce its drug laws, and
in December 1996, Spain and Portugal agreed to re-build check points along
their border to combat illegal immigration.  German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and
French President Jacques Chirac have proposed that the EU tackle anxiety over
cross-border crime by instituting common border controls, immigration, visa and
asylum policies.<p>
In Dublin, 11 Eastern European nations expressed an interest in joining the
EU.  If all 11 were admitted, the EU's population would expand from 370 million
to 470 million.  <p>
Some EU nations want to slow expansion, pointing out that the average
income of the 11 is one-third of EU levels, and that 80 percent of the EU's
budget already goes for payments to poorer member countries, principally
Portugal, Greece, Spain and Ireland, and for agricultural subsidies.<p>

Labor Mobility and Social Dumping

<h2>MIGRATION NEWS.<br>
Vol. 4, No. 1  January, 1997.<p>

Europe.<p>

Labor Mobility and Social Dumping</h2>
<ul>

<p>
The EU guarantees nationals of member nations "four freedoms"--free
movement of goods, capital, services and workers.  This means, for example,
that a French worker seeking a job in Germany cannot be discriminated against
because he is not German.<p>
Europe is known as an area of low mobility as workers tend to remain in
industrial areas that have lost their major employers rather than moving to
areas that offer jobs.  This helps to keep unemployment rates high.<p>
However, the boom in construction in Germany after unification has caused
workers to move across EU borders and tensions have arisen as a result.
Germany has high hourly wages and very high payroll taxes, so that employers
find it profitable to hire EU workers from countries with lower wage and
payroll taxes.<p>
German construction unions have argued since 1995 that, from the first day
of employment, foreign workers on German construction sites should receive the
same wages and benefits as German workers.  The UK, Portugal and many German
employers disagree, and they prevented the EU from adopting a "no social
dumping" clause until at least 1998.  <p>
After lengthy discussions, German employers and unions agreed that, from
January 1, 1997 through August 1997, all construction workers employed in
Germany must be paid at least $10.95 per hour in the former West Germany  and
$10.07 per hour in the former East Germany.  Minimum wages for German workers
under union contract are higher, $16.07 in former West Germany.  Workers under
German union contracts are also entitled to 30 days of paid vacation, one
month's pay as a Christmas bonus, an extra $1.29 hour in winter and payroll
taxes that are 20 percent of gross wages.<p>
Non-German workers do not necessarily get paid vacations and other benefits
and they are usually willing to work long hours and weekends to maximize their
earnings.<p>
The New York Times on December 11, 1996 quoted German construction
employers as saying that they could not operate without British and other
foreign workers.  There are about 200,000 unemployed German construction
workers and an estimated 500,000 legal and illegal foreign construction
workers, including 80,000 British and Irish workers.<p>
In November, 1995 the French minister for European affairs accused a
British firm of social dumping when it sent letters to 100 winter resorts in
France pointing out the cost savings they could achieve by utilizing British
workers.  According to the British firm, an employer paying a worker L1,000
(US$1,600) per month must pay an additional 20 percent or L200 in payroll
taxes, but a French employer paying a worker L1000 needs to pay another L1000
in various payroll taxes.  British workers abroad often have some of their pay
deposited in UK accounts.<p>
French firms could thus save money by hiring British workers on six to
12-month contracts and the British workers, whose British employers would pay
British health care taxes, would be covered under the French health care system
under European law.  A British firm offered to provide French builders with
British workers willing to work 50 hours weekly at regular pay, while French
law requires overtime pay after 39 hours per week.<p>
In March 1996, EU employment ministers agreed that EU workers posted to
another EU country must usually be paid the same wages as local workers from
the first day of their employment abroad.  EU nations may, however, permit
lower wages to be paid to intra-EU migrants for their first month in another EU
country.  EU member nations have two years to approve national implementing
legislation.<p>
On December 2, 1996, European Union social affairs ministers accepted a
report that linked Europe's unemployment problem with the generous social
protection provided there.  The report urges EU governments to avoid "excessive
charges on taxes and labor" which could have a "detrimental impact on
employment."<p>
The Federation of German Trade Unions on November 16, 1996 revised its
program on the social market economy adopted in 1981 and acknowledged that
Germany's current economic system has produced affluence.  The Federation also
endorsed more collective bargaining flexibility, ending its policy that all
agreements be negotiated between a national union and a national employer
group.<p>
On demographer noted that, in 1950, both India and Europe had about 160
million working age residents.  By 2050, under current trends, Europe will have
about 150 million working age residents and India 870 million.<p>

Germany-Kohl: Immigration Affects Unemployment

Germany-Kohl: Immigration Affects Unemployment</h2>
<ul>
<p>
In a debate on the government's proposed 1997 budget, Chancellor
Helmut Kohl said that immigration has made it difficult to reduce unemployment,
which was 10.1 percent in October, 1996.  Kohl said: "I don't want to suggest
that immigration is the major reason for unemployment, but it should be taken
into account when one makes comparison with other European countries."
According to Kohl, over 2.5 million immigrants arrived in Germany over the past
eight years, almost 25 years after guest worker recruitment ended.<p>
Of Germany's 81 million residents, about seven million are
foreigners.<p>
In early December, a repatriation agreement signed by the Bosnian and
German governments removed the last legal obstacles to forcible expulsions and
Germany sent thousands of letters to some of the 350,000 Bosnians ordering them
to leave Germany.  Under German law, the states or Laender are responsible for
returning Bosnians.  Kohl has been warning for a year that Germany no longer
can serve as the safe haven for nearly half of all Bosnian refugees outside the
former Yugoslavia.<p>
On December 4, German police forcibly placed 24 Bosnians on a charter
flight to be flown back to Bosnia.  The controversial action followed months of
complaints by Germany's 16 state governments that they can no longer tolerate
the social and economic burdens of supporting the 350,000 Bosnians currently in
Germany.  Berlin claims that supporting 36,000 ex-Yugoslavians costs DM500
million per year.<p>
Since October, 1996, some 35 Bosnians have been forcibly deported and 2,500
have voluntarily returned.  According to German officials there will be no more
mass returns until February 1997.<p>
In September, the German interior ministers of the Laender agreed to
repatriate the Bosnians in two phases; the first to be returned are unmarried
persons and couples without children.  Many have already received letters
ordering them to leave Germany.  After May 1, 1997, the remainder of the
Bosnians will be ordered to leave Germany.<p>
Critics of German policy say that dumping a large number of refugees on the
doorstep of the Sarajevo government while the political situation remains so
unstable will reduce the prospects for peace in Bosnia.<p>
A South African soccer/football player was the first person to become a
German citizen under a new law that gives 10 athletes per year preferential
access to German citizenship.  Rules such as the 10-year residence requirement
were waived so that a South African player could join the German national
team.<p>
In 1946, three million Czechs of German origin-- Sudeten Germans-- were
expelled from Czech territory and their property expropriated.  The unmet
German demand that the Czechs apologize for "ethnic cleansing" has so far
prevented the full normalization of relations.  On December 20, 1996, Germany
and the Czech Republic signed a declaration aimed at mending bilateral
relations.  <p>
In the declaration, Germany expressed contrition for the invasion and
occupation of Czechoslovakia from 1939 to 1945.  The Czechs regret the
expulsion of the Sudeten Germans at the end of the war.  Both sides agreed to
create a Czech-German Future Fund that will finance environmental, historical
and scientific projects, especially those that in some way help the victims of
the Third Reich.<p>
The Czech Republic is the last of the countries occupied by Nazi Germany to
fully normalize its relationship with Germany.<p>
The declaration does not address land ownership questions. The Czech
supreme court in 1995 upheld a 1945 decree that stripped Czechs of ethnic
German origin of their property and gave an amnesty to Czechs accused of
committing crimes of revenge against them.<p>
Czechs and Slovaks formed Czechoslovakia in 1918 and Ruthenia joined in
1919.  Before that, Bohemia, Moravia and Slovakia had been parts of the
Austro-Hungarian Empire.  Between World War I and World War II, Czechoslovakia
was 52 percent Czech, 23 percent German and 16 percent Slovak.<p>

France: Tougher Immigration Laws/Enforcement?

<h2>MIGRATION NEWS.<br>
Vol. 4, No. 1  January, 1997.<p>

Europe.<p>

France: Tougher Immigration Laws/Enforcement?</h2>
<ul>

<p>
After African immigrants occupied a church in the summer of 1996 to
protest French immigration laws, the French government promised to legitimize
the status of persons who entered France illegally and had French-born
children.  Under current law, they cannot obtain regular residence papers, but
they also cannot be deported.  <p>
Instead of following the government's lead to be generous in such cases,
granting legal status after 15 years of crime-free illegal residence in France,
the lower house of the French Parliament, after three days of debate in
mid-December, amended the proposal to require private citizens to notify local
authorities whenever they have non-EU foreigners in their homes.  French
Interior Minister Jean-Louis Debre said: "I am for zero illegal
immigration...The state must be given the means to deter foreigners who want to
enter France without resources, papers or jobs."<p>
Debre said that US-style immigration quotas could cause diplomatic problems
with France's ex-colonies in Africa.<p>
Many deputies asserted that there are five million foreigners among the 56
million French residents, including one million illegal immigrants.  The
government proposed that illegal children under 16 years old who can
prove residence in France from the age of six would receive a one-year
residence permit.  Foreign spouses of French citizens would not be granted
residence permits until they have been married for two years.<p>
On December 18, the French Council of State warned the government that
mandatory notification of non-residents' stays may be unconstitutional.  Under
the proposal, mayors could ask police to verify that a visitor had left a
private home after his visa expired. <p>
Meanwhile, well-publicized expulsions continue.  On December 23, illegal
immigrants were flown to Romania, the 32nd airlift since the election of
President Jacques Chirac in May 1995.  Some 20,000 foreigners have been removed
from France since May 1995, including 12,000 so far in 1996.<p>
Some 1,000 alien smugglers and 1,000 French employers, have been
arrested since May 1995; 38 illegal sweatshops were ordered closed.  In early
December, police broke up a ring smuggling illegal Asian immigrants into
garment shops in Parisian suburbs.<p>
On December 5, 1996 at the 19th Franco-African summit in Ouagadougou,
Burkina Faso, President Chirac told 49 African leaders that accelerated
economic development is the only possible way to stop "the problem of excessive
immigration" to France and other industrial countries.<p>
On December 13, over 50 illegal African immigrants occupied UNESCO's Paris
office for six hours to demand residence papers from the French government.
The immigrants are part of the group that occupied a Paris church for two
months this summer. <p>
France signed a deportation agreement with Hungary on December 16 that
allows each country to return illegal aliens to the other.<p>
French President Jacques Chirac on December 10 vowed to crack down on
discrimination and punish racism.  In an International Human Rights Day
address, Chirac attacked the anti-immigrant National Front party.  Chirac urged
French residents not to show hostility towards the country's Muslim community
despite an early December bombing that was possibly the work of the Algerian
Muslim fundamentalist rebels. <p>
The National Front mayor of Toulon gave a literary award to actress
Brigitte Bardot rather than writer Marek Halter because, the mayor said, Halter
was "in favor of immigration and we are against it."  Bardot, an ardent animal
rights crusader, is charged with inciting racial discrimination after speaking
out against Muslims for sacrificing sheep during their springtime holiday of
Eid al-Adha, a sacrifice that begins a feast culminating the holy month and the
annual pilgrimage to Mecca, Saudi Arabia.<p>
Bardot wrote "My homeland, my earth, is again invaded, with the blessing of
successive governments, by an overpopulation of foreigners, notably Muslim."
She called Le Pen "a very fine man" in her best-selling autobiography.<p>
On December 24, 1996, the French government said it received a letter from
Islamic guerrillas that threatened to "destroy" France unless the country
halted all aid to its former colony and freed fundamentalist prisoners.  A
December 3, 1996 bombing killed four people on an underground Paris commuter
train.<p>
One of the 188 Islamic militants who won a seat in Algeria's 430-member
legislature in December 1991 applied for asylum in the US and had his
application rejected in October 1996.  The Algerian was expelled from France in
1992 and is now being detained in the US.<p>
An Algerian civil war broke out in 1992 after the government canceled the
1992 runoff election that the opposition appeared poised to win.  Algeria
became independent from France in 1962 after a war that divided the French much
as the Vietnam War did Americans.<p>

Italy:  Legalization Finally Approved

Europe.<p>

Italy:  Legalization Finally Approved</h2>
<ul>

<p>
Beginning in November 1995, the Italian government issued six 60-day
decrees that permit illegal immigrants to remain in the country if they
register with local police.  Some 250,000 migrants registered.<p>
Italy's Constitutional Court in October 1996 said that the government
cannot keep issuing decrees; it must have the Italian Parliament approve an
amnesty law.  The National Alliance, part of the main center-right Freedom
Alliance opposition, first offered 7,000 amendments to prevent the
consideration of a bill that would put the legalization into law, but the
Italian Chamber of Deputies on December 4 approved the legalization plan by a
261-126 vote.<p>
The vote means that illegal foreigners who registered can remain in Italy
and that police may expel foreigners without appeal if they are considered a
threat to public order.<p>
Lampedusa, an Italian island with 5,000 residents that is closer to Tunisia
than to Rome, received an estimated 3,000 illegal aliens so far in 1996.  Many
of illegal aliens arrive from Tunisia via fishing boats.  <p>
Until November 1996, a 1990 law made it illegal to enter Lampedusa
unlawfully.  Now, illegal entry is not an offense, but smuggling people ashore
is.  Immigrants who illegally enter Lampedusa are asked to leave the Italian
island within 15 days.  Many do, but continue their travels to other EU nations
such as Germany or France.  <p>
At a December summit, Albania and Italy pledged to increase cooperation
between their police forces to fight organized crime and illegal immigrants.
The details of the accord were not available. <p>

immigration," BBC, December 11, 1996.   "New Italian law means 250,000
immigrants can stay," Reuters, December 5, 1996.  Paul Holmes, "Italian

Czech Immigration/Bulgarian Emigration</h2>
<ul>

<p>
The Czech Republic has one of the lowest unemployment rates in
Europe, three percent, which is attributed to low wages and a location that
attracts foreign investment, flexible labor markets with stingy unemployment
benefits and a slow restructuring of old state-owned industries.<p>
There are 250,000 foreign workers, mostly from Eastern Europe, employed in
the Czech Republic.  A Ukrainian worker employed for $2.50 per hour reported
that he paid a labor broker 50 percent of his hourly wage.<p>
Some Czech officials worry that granting asylum to a Vietnamese political
refugee may lead to the occupation of Czech embassies in Asia by Vietnamese
seeking asylum.  Kim Long applied for asylum at the Czech embassy in Thailand,
was granted refugee status by UN authorities in Bangkok and allowed to fly
Prague, where he was granted asylum.  Long intends to try to migrate to Canada,
where he has relatives.<p>
Educated Bulgarians are reportedly emigrating as fast as they can find
countries to take them.  According to the most recent Bulgarian census, about
500,000 of Bulgaria's 8.5 million residents have emigrated since 1990, with
most moving to the US (35 percent), Germany, the UK and Austria.  In 1995, more
than 7,000 professors and researchers, who average $50 per month in Bulgaria,
emigrated.  A survey found that 40 percent of Bulgaria's scientists are
planning to emigrate.  <p>

Swiss Referendum on Asylum</h2>
<ul>

<p>
On December 1, 1996 the Swiss voted 54 percent to 46 percent against
a measure that would prevented persons without documents from applying for
asylum and given the government control over any wages earned by
asylum-seekers.  The Swiss People's Party drew up the immigration initiative in
1991, when Switzerland had a record 42,000 asylum-seekers.  There were 17,000
applications for asylum in 1995.<p>
The Swiss government opposed the measure, arguing that it had already
reduced the number of asylum applications.  The initiative received its
strongest support in German-speaking cantons.<p>
Over 67 percent of Swiss voters rejected a change in labor laws which would
have opened the way for more overtime working and lifted a ban on Swiss women
working night shifts.<p>

<h2>MIGRATION NEWS.<br>
Vol. 4, No. 1  January, 1997.<p>

Europe.<p>

Russia and Central Asian Republics</h2>
<ul>

<p>
Moscow's mayor on December 22 said that Russia must introduce a
quota system to regulate the migration of ethnic Russians from CIS countries to
Russia.  He also said that he was concerned about the forced assimilation of
ethnic Russians in former Soviet Republics.  In Sevastopol, Ukraine, where 75
percent of the residents are ethnic Russians, all children are learning
Ukrainian in school. <p>
More than 300 persons from Azerbaijan have lived in a hotel in Moscow for
seven years, with many reportedly afraid to leave the hotel for fear the police
will deport them back to Azerbaijan.  The Azerbaijanis came to Moscow in 1989
as Soviet citizens and now find themselves foreigners.  In theory, those
fleeing conflicts are guaranteed either "forced migrant" or "refugee" status by
the Russian Constitution, but local laws often leave them with no official
status at all.<p>
A UN officer says that in some cities, refugees can not get permanent
residence registration unless they have refugee status, but they can not get
refugee status without residence registration.  <p>
Many Russian cities still operate with the Soviet pass system.  Moscow, for
example, requires residents to carry documents proving that they can work, thus
permitting police to use document checks to harass ethnic Caucasians, who are
blamed for much of the city's crime.  About seven percent of Russia's 150
million residents live in Moscow.<p>
There are an estimated nine million displaced people in Russia, including
3.5 million who escaped civil war or persecution. <p>
There are also an estimated 500,000 to one million illegal migrants from
China, Afghanistan and Africa in Russia, according to government
estimates.<p>
A Jewish family that was baptized as Catholic in Kazakstan 1990, emigrated
to Israel in 1991, and in November 1996 had their application for citizenship
rejected by the Israeli High Court, which noted that the Law of Return,
excludes Jews who have adopted another faith.  The Law of Return permits
spouses and the immediate family of someone who is accepted as Jewish are
allowed to qualify for Israeli citizenship.<p>
Under Jewish religious law, a Jew is defined as a person whose mother is a
Jew.  The Law of Return was drafted to grant Israeli citizenship to those who
would have been persecuted as Jews under the Nazis and was extended to the
grandchildren of a Jew.<p>
Russia and Poland signed an agreement on a visa-free border for Polish and
Russian citizens that has caused an "Eastern Flank scare" in Warsaw.  Polish
newspapers are publishing stories about an impending flood of immigration from
CIS countries.  Polish police believe the visa-free border will produce more
"imported crime."<p>
Polish officials claim that over 1.5 million people are waiting in Russia
for a chance to immigrate to Western Europe.  They fear that many Russians,
Ukrainians and Belarusians may remain in Poland.<p>
Many Russian bazaars operate in Poland; the small scale "suitcase trade" is
estimated at over one billion dollars a year.  Originally peddlers brought
goods with them to sell in Poland.  Today there are illegal sewing factories
around Warsaw that employ hundreds of Russian, Belarusian, Ukrainian and
Lithuanian women to produce clothes. <p>
There may be 500,000 mostly illegal guest workers in Poland.<p>
Sweden, Denmark, Finland and Norway have agreed to grant asylum to 108
refugees, primarily Kurds, who spent 16 days in 1995 being shuttled between
Russia and Lithuania in a train because neither country would accept them.
They were moved in April, 1995 to Latvia's Olaine internment camp near Riga and
held there for 20 months. <p>
The group's two-year ordeal began when they traveled overland to Moscow.
From Moscow, the group went to Latvia and boarded a boat to Sweden, which ran
aground on an Estonian island.  They were returned to Riga, Latvia and hid
until March 21, 1995, when they began their train journey as Latvia tried to
expel them.  <p>
After a UNHCR complaint against Latvia for holding the Kurds in the train
carriages, which were unsanitary and unheated, they were moved to the Olaine
prison, just outside Riga.  Conditions in the internment camp were reportedly
poor; the camp had a faulty heating system and little food or medicine.  Latvia
still has no legislation on refugees and asylum seekers.<p>
The economies of Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and
Turkmenistan shrank after Moscow eliminated subsidies in 1992 .  All except
Tajikistan are expected to grow in 1996.  Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan are
trying to shift from cotton to grains and to exploit their oil wealth, but most
property is still owned by the government, which also sets prices for many
commodities.  Kyrgyzstan has come closest to a Polish-style quick free-market
transition.<p>
Several reports focused on potential environmental emigration from Central
Asia.  In 1960, the Aral sea was the fourth largest lake in the world and
supported a thriving fishing industry.  Water was diverted from the rivers that
flow into the Aral sea to irrigate cotton and today the Aral sea is one-third
its 1960 size.  The water for 54 million nearby residents has been
poisoned.<p>

UK Employer Sanctions</h2>
<ul>

<p>
The UK's Home Affairs ministry mailed letters to 1.1 million British
employers in early December informing them that the employer sanctions included
in the 1996/97 Asylum and Immigration Act go into effect January 27, 1997.
Employers found to have hired illegal alien workers over 16 can be fined up to
L5000.  The government estimates employer compliance costs at L0.68 or about $1
per employee.<p>
An employer can escape employer sanctions if the employer can prove that he
saw and kept a copy of documentation which seemed to relate to the job
applicant and appeared to him to prove they were entitled to work in the UK.
The government said that "We are not expecting employers to act as immigration
officers. We wouldn't expect an employer to detect a good forgery, for example.
That is our business."<p>
Industries most likely to be affected by the new employer sanctions law
include farming, clothing, construction and catering.<p>
Some 10,000 illegal workers were apprehended in the UK in 1996 compared
with 4,000 in 1988.  In 1995, illegal entry action was initiated against 10,381
people, up from 7480 in 1994.  However, two thirds of the illegal aliens
detected in 1995 applied for asylum to prevent their removal from the
UK.<p>
About 35 percent of the illegals in 1995 deceived an immigration officer at
entry and 31 percent were smuggled into the UK.<p>
According to British press reports, "hundreds" of East Europeans are paying
L150 to register with agencies in Eastern Europe for "no documentation
required" jobs in the UK.  Typically young people pay another L750 for tourist
or student visas and then arrive in the UK to work long hours on farms and in
factories for L2 per hour, or about L80 to L100 per week.  While working, they
must pay up to half their earnings for transportation and
accommodations.<p>
The British company that the workers thought they were working for asserted
that it had only rented housing and vans to subcontractors who were the actual
employers.<p>

Asian Labor Migration</h2>
<ul>

<p>
Asian countries received $75 billion in remittances from workers
abroad in 1995 compared with $54 billion in official foreign aid, according to
the Asian Development Bank.<p>
More Asian workers seem to be emigrating illegally to avoid the long wait
for work permits and the heavy commission charged by labor brokers.  The Far
Eastern Economic Review in a May 23, 1996 cover story criticized immigration
countries for restricting access to their labor markets and thus pushing
migrants into illegal status, where they can be exploited.  The FEER reported a
conservative 2.6 million migrant workers in East Asia.<p>
The ADB noted that many migrants go abroad illegally to avoid waits and
fees and that a rising number of illegal workers are being apprehended in
Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand.  According to the FEER, Indonesian police are
involved in smuggling workers to Malaysia. <p>
A special issue of the Asian and Pacific Migration Journal is devoted to
Dynamics of Labor Migration in Asia.  The APMJ includes 10 papers that were
presented in March 1996 at a conference in Japan.  Topics covered include labor
contractors in Japan, migrant worker policies and conditions in Korea and
Taiwan, and the migration transition in Malaysia.  Copies may be ordered from
the Scalabrini Migration Center, fax 63(2)-721-4296, email smc@mnl.sequel.net,
or web site http://www.sequel.net/~smc<p>
In another blow to the theory of the Asian economic miracle, it is argued
that East Asian nations had high savings and rapid economic growth because they
had relatively few young and old people to support.  The percentage of the
population under 15 fell from 40 percent or more in the 1960s to 25 percent in
Korea.  According to NBER Working Paper 5560, the sharp drop in the dependency
ratio (the number of workers to the young and old who need support) fueled
savings and investment at home and abroad.  In this way, the global capital
market transfers investment funds from older savers in one country to younger
consumers in another.<p>
The Asian economic miracle is reportedly built on high savings and
investment rates, fiscal and monetary discipline, educated work forces and low
taxes.<p>
One economic history of the world asserts that the center of gravity in the
world economy was in the Mediterranean in the 16th and 17th centuries, then
moved to northern Europe in the 18th and 19th centuries and crossed the
Atlantic to America in the 20th century.  Based on present trends and policies,
the 21st century could be the Asian or Pacific century.<p>
Annual economic growth in East Asia (excluding Japan) has averaged 8.5
percent since 1985 and is forecast by the World Bank to grow at an eight
percent annual rate to 2005.  At seven percent growth compounded, East Asia
doubles per capita output every decade.<p>
Economic integration in Asia means that Asian countries in 1995 accounted
for about 70 percent of foreign direct investment within the region and 50
percent of all trade was intra-regional trade.<p>

Malaysia: New Agency and Crackdown

<h2>MIGRATION NEWS.<br>
Vol. 4, No. 1  January, 1997.<p>

Asia.<p>

Malaysia: New Agency and Crackdown</h2>
<ul>

<p>
The Malaysian government plans to establish a new agency in 1997 to
handle all matters pertaining to foreign workers.  There have been allegations
that the government's Foreign Workers' Task Force detains illegal foreign
workers from some employers and then releases them to other employers. <p>
The government announced on December 17 that 8,000 foreigners, including
2,000 Indonesians, who were caught working illegally in the country will be
deported.  Among the first to be deported will be those found unfit to work
because they are suffering from infectious diseases, or are judged illiterate
or too old. <p>
The 8,000 illegals are among the almost 11,000 foreigners now held in 10
detention camps throughout the country after they were arrested for entering
without proper working permits in Malaysia.  The remaining illegal immigrants
will be allowed to stay in the camps so that they can be recruited by potential
employers. <p>
A government official also said that an independent inquiry failed to find
any proof that the illegals are being mistreated in the detention camps.<p>
Beginning in January, 1997, Malaysia is stiffening penalties on smugglers
and brokers, making those who harbor illegal aliens, including employers of
five or more illegal aliens and landlords who rent to them, responsible for the
cost of apprehending and returning them to their country of origin, as well as
fines of M$50,000 ($20,000), two to five years in prison and six strokes of the
cane.  Making, forging or altering a visa, permit, pass or certificate can lead
to fines of M$ 30,000 to M$ 100,000.<p>
Illegal foreigners face deportation after a first entry and subject to
M$10,000 in fines, 10 years in jail and six strokes of the cane if they return.
Employers found to have hired illegal alien workers face fines of M$10,000 to
M$50,000 ($4,000 to $20,000).<p>
Late December press reports suggest that some foreigners are attempting to
leave Malaysia before December 31, 1996. Illegal immigrants who entered
Malaysia before July 31, 1996 are allowed to register until December 31, 1996
if they want to continue working in Malaysia.  As of mid-December, 1996, about
300,000 workers had been registered by 17,000 employers<p>
Malaysia built a $22 million, 17-mile wall-- eight feet tall, two feet
thick and topped with barbed wire--on its northern border with Thailand to
deter illegal immigration.  One report says that 30,000 Bangladeshis are in
Thailand along the  Malaysian-Thai border waiting for an opportunity to cross
the border.  Some Bangladeshi politicians have reportedly called for
recognition of a right to migrate around the world in search of work.<p>
A nationwide crackdown on illegal immigrants is scheduled to begin on
January 1, 1997.<p>
Most reports say that there are about two million foreigners in Malaysia,
half illegal, making them about 25 percent of the eight million labor force.
Some 300,000 Malaysians are unemployed.  The number of foreigners in Malaysia
has increased from an estimated 100,000 in the late 1970s to 600,000 in the
late 1980s.<p>
Many academics have urged the government to restrict the entry of foreign
workers and allow wage rates to increase in order to reduce labor shortages and
spur productivity growth.  The government seems to agree: "The future foreign
workers will be knowledge workers.  The non-skilled workers will only be needed
in the construction and plantation sectors."<p>
However, a gas station owner noted that, it is more expensive to buy
self-service gas pumps than to hire Bangaldeshi attendants, who typically earn
M$900 or $360 per month for 12 to 14 hour days, six days per week.  Beginning
on January 1, 1997, gas stations are supposed to begin to convert to self
service.<p>
In mid-November, the Straits Times opened its article "Can KL shut
floodgates on  foreign workers?" with this description of urban life:  "Petrol
is pumped by Bangladeshis, rubbish cleared by Indonesians, hotel rooms tidied
by Filipinos, restaurant meals served by Myanmar nationals and trouser
measurements taken by Pakistanis."<p>
Some 25,000 foreigners from 52 countries are working on the M$9 billion
Kuala Lumpur International Airport.<p>
As the number of foreigners increases, social issues have become more
important.  One leader of a housing estate said of foreigners: "They are living
next to us, marrying our daughters and making this place unsafe." In September,
1996, 100 residents and 70 Bangladeshis clashed in the streets.<p>
Employers often house Bangladeshis, Nepalese and Myanmar nationals who do
not speak Malay, Chinese or Tamil in housing estates with middle-class
Malaysians.  At least 2,000 Bangladeshi men have married local women since
1990, most of them ethnic Indians.<p>
A typical political proposal is "Foreign workers are here to work. They
should not be allowed to mix with Malaysian women."  The government announced
that, like Singapore, foreigners who marry Malaysian women will not
automatically be allowed to stay in Malaysia.  The Federation of Malaysian
Manufacturers wants foreign workers to be allowed to bring their wives to
Malaysia so that the wives can work.<p>
In discussing a significant investment for a computerized method of
handling ship containers, Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr. Mahathir Mohamad said
that "If we do not want foreign workers, then we will have to find ways to
replace them."  The government has tried to offset publicity that says that
especially Bangladeshis commit crimes and marry Malay women to get legal
status.  According to the government, foreigners were involved in less than six
percent of all serious crimes committed in Malaysia in 1995 and only 1,000 to
2,000 foreigners have married local women.<p>
However, 50 percent of the babies born in most government hospitals are
from migrant parents and some worry about how Malays will react to foreigners
if there is a recession.<p>
Malaysia announced plans to create a savings program that would encourage
foreign workers to keep their savings in the country; remittances are estimated
to be M$2.5 billion ($1 billion) per year.<p>
In December, Malaysia unveiled its seventh five-year plan, which forecasts
eight percent annual economic growth between 1996 and 2000, down from 8.7
percent per year during the first half of the 1990s.  Manufacturing growth is
to be maintained by increasing productivity, not adding workers.<p>
Malaysia's per capita income was about $4,000 in 1995.<p>

1996. "New agency to tackle foreign-worker issues," Straits Times, December 19,
1996. "Malaysia to begin deporting 8,000 illegal foreign workers," Deutsche

Japan: Boat People and Citizenship</h2>
<ul>

<p>
A group of 24 Pakistanis arrived in Kagoshima on a freighter and
received transit visas and then were detained on suspicion that they were
attempting to enter Japan to work.  They boarded the cargo ship in China and
South Korea masquerading as sailors, after buying sailors' ID cards from a
Pakistani company for about 500,000 yen each. <p>
A Japanese fishing boat carrying 100 Chinese thought to be trying to enter
Japan was stopped on December 11, 1996.<p>
The city government of Hiroshima granted Japanese nationality on December
19, 1996 to a child born of a Philippine woman and a Japanese father who was
married to another woman.  The decision followed a court-mediated settlement
worked out in the Hiroshima District Court between the mother and the Japanese
government.  <p>
The Filipino woman came to Japan in 1988 but overstayed her visa.  In
September 1991, she gave birth.  In April 1992 she filed the lawsuit against
the Japanese government to block her deportation.<p>
The court-mediated settlement followed a Justice Ministry announcement in
July that it would grant legal residency in Japan to divorced, separated,
widowed or otherwise single foreigners who are bringing up children who have at
least one Japanese parent.<p>
About half of Asian and Brazilian workers in Japan said they like Japan,
according to a December 1996 survey of 900 workers from China, Taiwan, South
Korea, the Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia, Myanmar, Indonesia and Brazil.  The
migrant workers averaged 200,000 yen per month and their monthly pay ranged
from 250,000 yen per month for workers from Brazil and Taiwan to 180,000 for
Filipinos and 130,000 for Indonesians.<p>
Most Taiwanese, Filipinos, and Malaysians liked working in Japan, but a
majority of Brazilian and Thai workers said that they were not satisfied in
Japan.<p>
There are about 1.23 million foreigners living in Japan.<p>

<h2>MIGRATION NEWS.<br>
Vol. 4, No. 1  January, 1997.<p>

Asia.<p>

Hong Kong and China</h2>
<ul>

<p>
After the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, the UK adopted the British
Nationality Selection Scheme to anchor 50,000 key people and their families in
Hong Kong, a total of 135,000, by granting them British nationality.  There are
fears that the sensitive list of those receiving British passports has been
leaked to China.<p>
China regards the holders of British passports obtained under a special
scheme as dual citizens and therefore not entitled to full consular protection
in Hong Kong.<p>
There is speculation about what will happen to Hong Kong residents living
outside Hong Kong on July 1, 1997.  Under Chinese guidelines, permanent
residents who emigrate and acquire foreign nationality can retain their right
of abode and access to foreign consular protection if they return and settle in
Hong Kong before July 1, 1997. <p>
British officials have asked China to assure Hong Kong residents who are
overseas that they do not have to be in Hong Kong on July 1, 1997 to preserve
their residence rights.  If China does not grant this assurance, British
officials warn that there could be a rush by overseas Hong Kong people to the
territory on the eve of the handover.<p>
Emigration from Hong Kong is at its lowest level since the Tiananmen Square
massacre of June 1989.  A survey of five countries that have been magnets for
Hong Kong &eacute;migr&eacute;s found that only Australia has had any
significant increase in arrivals in 1996 over 1995.  <p>
The estimate of migration to Canada this year was 18,800 compared with
19,000 last year and 32,600 in 1994, the survey said, quoting from figures
provided by immigration lawyers.  Immigration visas issued by the United States
totaled 8,641 in the January-November period this year, compared with 11,018
last year and 11,000 in 1994.<p>
Immigration analysts warn that the figures are deceptive because most of
the would-be emigrants left the territory in the early 1990s, following the
Tainanmen Square crackdown.  Many are now returning to Hong Kong because they
have completed residency requirements abroad.  With a foreign passport in case
of an emergency, Hong Kong emigrants feel safer about returning to Hong Kong.
<p>
About 150 immigrants from China arrive in Hong Kong every day, 70 per cent
come from Guangdong and 15 per cent from Fujian, as do 142,000 other entrants.
About 60 illegal aliens are apprehended daily, down from 80 daily in 1995.
<p>
Hong Kong police report that the number of illegal immigrants from China to
the territory declined 13 percent in the first 11 months of 1996.  The police
also report that the number of crimes committed by illegal immigrants has
declined by 30 percent over the same period.   <p>
After July 1, 1997, China plans to continue customs and immigration
controls on persons entering Hong Kong from China.  Hong Kong's immigration
office currently has 5,700 officers.<p>
China has announced that the 139,000 Filipino workers in Hong Kong will be
allowed to remain after Hong Kong reverts from British to Chinese rule on
midnight of June 30, 1997.  There are 32,000 British nationals in Hong Kong and
their employers will have to prove to local authorities that they cannot find
local workers if they want to receive work permits after July 1, 1997.<p>
In December 1996, there were 11,000 Vietnamese in camps in Hong
Kong.<p>
About 6.3 million people live in Hong Kong and Hong Kong attracted almost
12 million tourists in 1997.<p>
Shenzhen, across the border from Hong Kong, gave 906 migrant families 15
days to return to their villages of origin because they has too many children.
The city revoked their work permits and ordered housing authorities to stop
renting them housing.  Local residents often refer to migrants as "outsiders"
and blame them for crime and congestion.<p>

December 20, 1996. "Hong Kong emigration hits lowest level since Tiananmen
massacre," Agence France Presse, December 15, 1996.<p>

Philippines:  Regulating Migrant Conditions

<h2>MIGRATION NEWS.<br>
Vol. 4, No. 1  January, 1997.<p>

Asia.<p>

Philippines:  Regulating Migrant Conditions</h2>
<ul>

<p>
There are an estimated 4.2 to 4.5 million Filipinos from a
population of 70 million working abroad.  Most of them are women, including 95
percent of the 131,165 Filipino domestic workers in Hong Kong.  According to
the Philippines' Overseas Workers Welfare Administration, at least 700 Filipino
migrants died in foreign countries 1996.<p>
Several Philippine politicians have proposed new programs, financed by fees
charged to migrants, to better protect them overseas.  However, many Filipino
migrants say that they already pay too many fees.  <p>
Filipino domestics abroad already pay, for example, monetary insurance of
HK$32 once every two years; a lifetime welfare fee of HK$200 to cover legal
aid, counseling, medical assistance, repatriation and burial fees, a
repatriation fee of $ 120 once every two years and a yearly Medicare levy of
$300.  Each contract renewal costs $200 plus authentication fees of $425.
Income tax of $132 is paid to the Philippine government on the $3,750 minimum
wage.<p>
The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas estimated in October 1996 that 42 percent
of remittances to the Philippines went through banks, and announced plans to
compete more effectively with the padala (courier) system for transferring
money home.  According to BSP, some 4.2 million Filipinos send home an average
$350 per month, or a total of $12 billion per year, but only $7 billion is
reflected in bank and balance of trade data.<p>
In 1982, President Marcos said the Overseas Contract Workers (OCW's)
Program would be a temporary measure to alleviate unemployment while the
country moved towards an industrial economy.<p>
About 45 percent of the Filipino labor force are employed in agriculture,
but agriculture generates only about 25 percent of Philippine GDP.  The 16,000
Philippine sugar growers employ about 500,000 workers to produce two million
tons of sugar each year.  However, the Philippine sugar industry is not
efficient; in 1995, the Philippines was a net importer of sugar.<p>
The 1,500 Vietnamese boat people on the western island of Palawan who were
permitted to stay in the Philippines after the Catholic church promised to care
for them are seeking renewable six-month special work permits.  Many want to

Indonesia:  Substitute Natives for Foreigners</h2>
<ul>

<p>
Beginning in 1997, all foreign workers in Indonesia will have to pay
a levy of US$100 per month.  The money will be deposited in a skills
development fund, and used to run training programs to improve the skills of
Indonesian workers.  When asked to provide an example of how the training funds
might be used, the manpower minister said that journalists could improve their
English "so that Indonesian reporters can reach the same standards as American
reporters, can work in CNN and other such occupations."<p>
The government expects to raise US $50 million per year from the 57,000
foreigners currently working in Indonesia, earning an estimated $2.4 billion
per year.  The announcement comes three months after the Indonesian Parliament
passed a bill backing a five-fold increase in the annual municipal tax on
foreigners living in Jakarta.  <p>
In April 1996, the Indonesian government issued a list of industries that
will be closed to foreign workers to reduce their number.  Thirty percent of
the foreigner workers in Indonesia are in mining, and 11,000 are South
Koreans.<p>
Indonesia, which has almost 200 million residents scattered over 13,000
islands speaking 350 languages, attracted $40 billion in foreign investment
commitments in 1995.  Not all these promised investments will be made.
Indonesia is trying to walk a tightrope between holding down wages but not
having trade sanctions slapped on Indonesia.  In November, 1996, the Indonesian
Supreme Court reversed an earlier decision and found some labor activists
guilty and in December, 1996, more labor union leaders went on trial.<p>
The ILO released a report that asserted that "The general situation of
workers in Indonesia has not evolved but is still characterized by serious and
worsening infringement of basic human and trade human rights... including
arrest, imprisonment and harassment of workers and trade union leaders."
Minimum wages rose 30 percent in 1996.<p>
The last group of Vietnamese boat people left Galang Island on September 2,
1996.  The 8,000-hectare island will be developed into an industrial zone.

Korea To Increase Foreign Trainees</h2>
<ul>

<p>
On December 6, 1996, Korea announced that it would increase the
number of Chinese trainees in the country.  About 12,0000 of the 80,000 foreign
industrial trainees in Korea are ethnic Koreans from China.<p>
A family of 17, the biggest group of North Korean defectors since the
Korean War, arrived in Seoul in December 1996, six weeks after escaping across
the frozen Tuman River through China and Hong Kong.  Their escape was financed
by relatives in the United States.  The family stayed with some of the two
million ethnic Koreans in China, posing as rural migrant workers. <p>
About 150 North Koreans have defected to South Korea in the past three
years, including about 30 in 1996.  Hundreds of North Koreans reportedly reside
illegally in China and Russia.<p>
Korea in December announced changes to its labor laws that would legitimize
new unions after 2000, but immediately give employers more freedom to dismiss
workers after 60 days notice.  Most wage negotiations are at the company level
and multiple unions in one company will not be permitted until 2002.  Unions
will be permitted to engage in union activities, but civil servants will not be
allowed to join unions.<p>
The Korean government has recognized the Federation of Korea Trade Unions,
with 1.2 million members, but not the 500,000-member Korean Federation of Trade
Unions.<p>
On December 27, over 350,000 Korean workers went on strike to protest the
approval of the new labor laws in a secret six-minute session of the National
Assembly that began at 6am on December 26, with only members of the ruling New
Korea Party voting.  The government said that it would not tolerate the illegal
strike.<p>

Singapore Steps up Enforcement</h2>
<ul>

<p>
A Korean joint venture firm, Ssangyong-Guan Ho Joint Venture, was
fined a record S$1.56 million for employing illegal foreign workers.  After a
3.5 day trial in August 1996, the firm was convicted of 50 charges of having
illegal aliens on a construction site and fined S$23,000 per illegal alien,
plus S$412,000 for three-years of unpaid levies; 26 workers were employed
without work permits.<p>
During a March 1996 raid, inspectors found 188 Indonesian and Malaysian
workers; 139 without valid entry permits and 49 without work permits.<p>
A new law went into effect in March 1996 that makes the general contractor
responsible for all violations of immigration laws at construction
sites.<p>
In December 1996, Singapore permitted janitorial service firms to recruit
workers not only in Malaysia, but also in Bangladesh, Thailand and the
Philippines for public sector cleaning jobs.  About 32 of the 262 registered
cleaning contractors in Singapore are expected to qualify to recruit additional
foreign workers.  The cleaning industry estimates the current shortage of
workers at 30 per cent to 40 per cent.<p>

<ul>

<p>
Australia's Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs on
December 13, 1996 promised a "a planned and balanced migration program" that
would admit 74,000 immigrants per year.  The new government abolished the
Office of Multicultural Affairs and the Bureau of Immigration and Population
Research.<p>
The fallout over a September 10, 1996 speech by a newly elected member of
Parliament, Pauline Hanson, who said that Australia was "in danger of being
swamped by Asians" continued.  Despite a joint parliamentary resolution that
reaffirmed a nondiscriminatory immigration policy, a poll by the Far Eastern
Economic Review found that most senior Asian executives see Australia as less
attractive for investment because of the speech and they believe Prime Minister
John Howard's government has mishandled reactions to it.<p>
According to one poll, 48 percent of Australians agree that there are too
many Asian immigrants arriving.  About five percent of Australia's residents
are "visible minorities."<p>
The Economist summarized one view of changing Australia.  The old Australia
was based on five ideas: a "white Australia", trade protection, centralized
wage arbitration intended to ensure a decent standard of living for all, state
paternalism and the link to the British empire.  Since 1975, the new Australia
has embraced multiculturalism, the dismantling of tariffs, tentative moves away
from centralized wage bargaining, a loss of faith in government and "national
maturity."<p>
According to the World Bank, Australia remains the richest country in the
world, when unexploited natural resources are taken into account.<p>
Australia's Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs maintains a
web site at http://www.immi.gov.au/<p>
In New Zealand, two economists argued that the government's tightening of
business migration laws has reduced the number of Asian investors.  Immigration
requirements imposed in 1996 include tougher English language standards and
place value on business experience.  Of 997 immigrant approvals in October
1996, 14 were for business investors.<p>

Immigration into Venezuela

Immigration into Venezuela</h2>
<ul>

<p>
Colombia and Venezuela share 2,219 kilometers of border and many
Colombians take advantage of better opportunities in Venezuela and move there.
Venezuela's president Rafael Caldera spoke of "hundreds of thousands, possibly
even millions of Colombian immigrants living in Venezuela" when he addressed
the Colombian Congress in September 1995.  <p>
Venezuela is a country of 21 million with 1993 per capita GNP of $2,800 in
1993.  The minimum wage was raised to 45,000 Bolivars ($150) per month in
February 1996 and unemployment is 25 percent.  Colombia is a country of 36
million with a per capita GNP of $1,400. <p>
One estimate is that 70 percent of the immigrants living in the
northwestern Venezuelan state of Tachira are Colombians.  Colombians are 90
percent of the agricultural labor force in Tachira and most earn less than $40
a month.<p>
Venezuela in March 1995 deported 1,000 Colombians from the western
Venezuelan border area and announced plans to conduct a census to locate and
deport illegal immigrants.  A February 1995 attack on a Venezuelan border
military post that left eight Venezuelan soldiers dead strained relations
between the two countries.<p>
Venezuela seems to prefer European to Colombian immigrants.  In Fall 1994,
Venezuela asked the European Union (EU) for aid to help 5,000 to 10,000
immigrants from East European nations move to Venezuela each year.  Thousands
of Spaniards and Portuguese migrated to Venezuela in the late 1940s.  A total
of 800,000 immigrants arrived in Venezuela between 1948 and 1961.<p>
Regional officials in Venezuela blamed a cholera outbreak in December 1996
on uncontrolled immigration from Colombia and non-stop rain.  Immigration
officials do not keep count of the number of people going in and out of
Venezuela, making it harder for health authorities to control the
disease.<p>

Garnica, "Venezuela to crack down on illegals," United Press International,

NBER Working Paper 5763.  September. http://nber.harvard.edu/<p>
Foreign-born workers earned about $0.50 less than US-born workers in 1989,
with the hourly wage gap largest for Mexican-born immigrants.  The gap is
widest upon arrival and closes by 0.8 percent per year after arrival, so that,
e.g. a 10 percent wage gap ($10 for US-born workers and $9 for foreign-born
workers) would be closed within about 12 years.<p>
Huddle, Donald.  1996. The Net Costs of Immigration: The Facts, the Trends
and the Critics.  Washington, DC. Carrying Capacity Network.
800-466-4866.<p>
This study estimates that immigration cost the US a net $65 billion in
1996, including $50 billion more in government expenditures on behalf of
immigrants than the immigrants pay in taxes.  In addition, Huddle estimates
that immigrants cost $15 billion for indirect worker displacement costs such as
unemployment benefits.<p>
Two thirds of the costs, or $41 billion, are attributed to legal
immigration.  According to Huddle, immigration's net costs will rise over the
next decade.<p>
The Urban Institute, in a 1994 publication, Immigration and Immigrants:
Setting the Record Straight, concluded that immigration results net balance of
government revenues that are $25 billion to $30 billion more than the
government spends on immigrants.<p>
Simon, Julian. 1995.  Immigration: The Demographic and Economic Facts. Cato
Institute: Washington, DC.  <p>
This 51-page monograph argues that little has changed in immigration except
the "anti-immigrant" rhetoric.  According to Simon, the 3.2 million illegal
aliens estimated to be in the US in October 1992 is about unchanged since the
early 1980s, and immigrant families receive an average $1,400 in welfare
payments in their first five years in the US, versus $2,300 for natives
(immigrants are not eligible for the same benefits as natives).<p>
Simon asserts that, on average, immigrant families contribute $2,500 more
in taxes than they draw in publicly-funded benefits.<p>
UN Development Program.  1996. Human Development Report 1996.  The UN's
seventh annual Human Development Report reported that there are 89 countries in
which the average person is worse off than in the mid-1980s.  In 19 countries,
including Ghana, Haiti, Liberia, Nicaragua, Rwanda and Venezuela, per capita
income is below the 1960 level.<p>
The UNDP ranks Canada first among 174 nations in human development, even
though Canada was only one of three rich countries--the other two were Finland
and Ireland--considered worse off today than in 1980.  The next countries in
the ranking, which combines life expectancy, education and purchasing power,
are the US and Japan.<p>

</UL>

<p>

The <EM>California Rural Community</EM> (CARUCOM) data base is
a service of <A HREF="http://migration.ucdavis.edu/">Rural Migration News</A>.
It was created for city planners, researchers, and students who
want access to census statistical profiles of rural California
communities. The data base will be under construction for the
next few months. We will put new communities, census years, and
variables on line as they become available. 
<P>
The CARUCOM data were assembled from the <A HREF="http://www.urban.org/">Urban Institute's</A>
Under Class Data Base (UDB) for the 1980 and 1990 census years.
This data base contains social, demographic, economic, and housing
data on census tracts across the United States. Tracts may be
viewed as approximating large neighborhoods because they tend
to contain groups of residents with similar social characteristics,
economic status, and housing conditions. Typically, a census tract
includes between 2,500 and 8,000 persons. To illustrate the geographic
detail provided by census tracts, in 1990 there were 9 census
tracts in both Watsonville and Parlier. 
<P>
We first extracted data on all census tracts in California's 12
major agricultural regions. With the aid of census maps, we then
identified all tracts contained entirely or partly in rural towns
with populations of between 1,000 and 20,000 and with 8 percent
or more of their workforces employed principally in agriculture.
The data include information on 47 variables for each of 66 California
rural towns scattered across the counties of <a href=#fres>Fresno</a>,<a href=#impe> Imperial</a>,<a href=#kern>
Kern<a/>,<a href=#king> Kings</a>, <a href=#made>Madera</a>,<a href=#merc> Merced</a>, <a href=#mont>Monterey</a>, <a href=#napa>Napa</a>, <a href=#sanj>San Joaquin</a>, <a href=#stan>Stanislaus</a>,<a href=#tula>
Tulare</a>, and <a href=#vent>Ventura</a>. Although there were some changes in census
tracts between 1980 and 1990, the UDB utilizes a &quot;comparability
file&quot; produced by the Census Bureau to reconfigure data from
1990 into tract boundaries used in the 1980 Census. This makes
it possible to track changes in demographic and economic characteristics
of the communities we have &quot;constructed&quot; from these
census tracts over time. 
<P>
For each community included in the data base, a wide array of demographic and socioeconomic variables
and percentage changes in these variables between 1980 and 1990 is available. The available communites may be selected either from the list or from the clickable map below.  The data are of course constructed from specific Census Bureau categories, in order to see how the data follow from Census definitions, consult this <a href= descr.html>description</a> file.  To download the master file from which the individual tables were created click <a href=carudata.xls>here</a>. (The file is 68k and is saved in tab delimited text so should be readable by any spreadsheet program.)</p>
<p>For the purpose of comparison here are some tables which rank the CARUCOM communties according to key variables of interest:
<UL> 
<LI> <a href=rankings/popch.html>Population Change</A>
<LI> <a href=rankings/hpop.html>Hispanic Population</A>
<LI> <a href=rankings/forbo.html>Foreign Born Population</A>
<LI> <a href=rankings/hispo.html>Hispanics Living in Poverty</A>

on the use of immigrant workers in Iowa's meatpacking industry.
The story emphasized the role of meat packing companies in recruiting
immigrant workers to move to Iowa, and said that &quot;perhaps
no industry is so dependent on this low-wage labor as the nation's
meat and poultry companies.&quot;</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">A July 1996 Changing Face of Rural America
conference of social scientists, by contrast, emphasized that,
in most midwestern meat packing plants, Latinos work alongside
US-born Blacks and whites. Latinos are less than half of most
plants' work force, and many of them are US-born citizens.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Many Latinos move to the Midwest because,
in contrast to seasonal farm jobs in California, where workers
average 1,000 hours per year at $5 to $6 per hour, in meat packing
plants, workers average 2,000 hours at $6 to $8 per hour, enough
to support a family. The Changing Face report is available at:
http://migration.ucdavis.edu</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">The US News &amp; World Report story
focused on Storm Lake, Iowa, a town of 8,700 that has an IBP plant
that slaughters 13,000 hogs each day. Education costs and crime
are up. Almost half of the kindergarten class in 1996 is non-Caucasian.
Many of the workers are from Santa Rita, Mexico, 100 miles southeast
of Guadalajara; some allegedly buy false documents from IBP employees
who sell them on the side. </FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">About $5,000 worth of money orders are
mailed from Storm Lake to Mexico each week.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">IBP bought the Storm Lake packing plant
for $2.5 million in 1981, and it received $1.9 million in tax
incentives and a $9.5 million revenue bond from the city. Turnover
in the plant is high; an average of 183 workers had to be hired
to keep every 100 jobs filled in 1990, according to one IBP manager.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">There are about 500,000 children in K-12
schools in Iowa. The number of Limited English Proficiency children
in K-12 Iowa schools has increased from 3,107 in 1989 to 6,931
in 1996, including 21 percent of the Storm Lake students.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Meat packing is a $95 billion per year
business dominated by three companies, IBP, Cargill's Excel Corp.
and Con-Agra's Monfort Inc. IBP had sales of $12 billion in 1995,
and profits of $257 million.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">The INS district director for Iowa and
Nebraska estimated that 25 percent of the 50,000 workers who dis-assemble
animals in the 222 meat packing plants in the two states are unauthorized
aliens. INS inspections of the workers in 15 plants since 1992
have led to 1,000 workers being detained, and the INS is opening
an office in Cedar Rapids, Iowa in January 1997.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT COLOR=#000000 FACE="Courier">On August 24, 30 INS inspectors
surrounded a Monfort-Swift plant in Marshalltown at the end of
a work shift, detaining 147 of the 900 employees as they left.
Most were flown to Mexico within 48 hours.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT COLOR=#000000 FACE="Courier">Another 24 workers were
apprehended at an IBP facility in Waterloo, Iowa. After an April
1996 raid on All-State Quality Food, 47 apprehended workers pled
guilty to working in the US illegally, making them subject to
criminal penalties if they are apprehended in the US again.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT COLOR=#000000 FACE="Courier">Most of the meatpacking
plants are constantly hiring new workers to replace workers who
quit, and many of the Hispanic workers employed in meatpacking
plants use fraudulent documents to obtain their jobs. Meatpackers
say that they can only ask job applicants if they are &quot;legally
entitled&quot; to work in the US, and close scrutiny of worker
documents can lead to charges of discrimination. The INS, however,
estimates that 85 percent of the &quot;documented illegals&quot;
are &quot;knowingly hired&quot; by employers.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT COLOR=#000000 FACE="Courier">Meatpacking companies offer
starting wages of $5 to $7 per hour. According to OSHA, about
36 percent of meatpacking workers are injured on the job each
year. </FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT COLOR=#000000 FACE="Courier">Newly-hired workers are
not eligible for health insurance benefits for off-the-job injuries
for their first six months of employment, and then they share
the cost of the premium on an 80-20 basis (workers pay 20 percent).</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT COLOR=#000000 FACE="Courier">Rural Oklahoma is also
attracting Hispanic immigrants for meat and poultry processing
jobs. Commerce, OK, a town of 2500, increased its Hispanic population

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">The San Diego Union-Tribune ran feature
stories on September 22-23 that explored immigrant integration
in Mecca, California, a farm worker town of 5,000 near Coachella
with an average income of $5,000 per person per year.  In nearby
Palm Springs, average annual incomes are $70,000.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">The complaint among the farm workers
camped in parking lots looking for work was: &quot;too many people
and too little work.&quot;  Some employers say that they have
100 people for every job.  </FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">A Changing Face conference of immigrant
integration was held in Riverside in March, 1996; the conference
report is available at: http://migration.ucdavis.edu</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Most Coachella Valley farmers offer farm
workers over $5 per hour for workers they hire directly; workers
hired through farm labor contractors typically receive less. 
Many of the farms are large; Peter Rabbit Farms, founded in 1950,
is a 5,000 acre operation, including 2,000 acres of carrots, 600
acres of grapes, and 600 acres of lemons, grapefruit, and oranges.
 Peter Rabbit has 120 year-round and 1,500 peak winter employees.
 Annual workers compensation premiums were over $1 million, which
would imply an annual payroll of $8 to $10 million.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Farm worker cities in rural California
are growing twice as fast as the state's population, as newly-legalized
farm workers bring their families to the US.  Many of these &quot;overgrown
labor camps&quot; are over 50 percent Latino, and some are over
95 percent Hispanic.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">As farmers destroyed on-farm housing,
workers moved into cities near major farming areas, and had to
pay for services that were previously free.  In many cases, workers
today spend 25 to 35 percent of their wages on housing and rides
to work. </FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Housing is a serious problem for all
poor people, but especially for recently-arrived immigrants in
farm worker towns.  In most cases, friends and relatives double
up, so that 10 to 20 people may share a one-bedroom apartment.
 Unlike in cities, the handful of public housing projects in farm
worker towns are often oases that workers living in parking lots
dream of moving into.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">The Fresno Bee on August 18, 1996 ran
a lengthy article on the sharp drop in on-farm farm worker housing
in the San Joaquin Valley, the eight county area centered on Fresno
that employs half of California's farm workers.  Instead of providing
workers with on-farm housing subject to federal and state inspection,
more and more farmers are razing their farm worker housing.  As
a result, most farm workers crowd into urban dwellings, including
backyard structures and garages.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Much of the Fresno Bee story involved
Gerawan Farming, the largest peach, plum and nectarine producer
in the United States which bulldozed housing for 400 farm workers
in 1995.  This housing cost $1.6 million to construct and some
was only 18 months old.  Gerawan employs 8,000 farm workers in
peak season.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Many San Joaquin Valley towns have become
farm worker service centers, with local residents, for a fee,
providing everything from housing and meals to forged work documents,
rides to the fields, and check cashing services.  In one such
town, Parlier, the mayor says that the population expands from
9,500 to 13,000 each summer, as workers arrive from Mexico.  Many
wind up living in &quot;The Jungle,&quot; a collection of ramshackle
houses and abandoned vehicles on Manning Avenue.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Despite the influx of migrants looking
for summer housing, there are practically no &quot;for rent&quot;
signs in Parlier.  Instead, migrants rely on friends, relatives
or labor contractors to arrange housing.  In many cases, 10 or
20 men share a two- or three-bedroom apartment, each paying $30
to $40 per week and generating for the landlord two to four times
normal rents.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">One grower spent $300,000 over six years
to house up to 96 men on an 800-acre grape and almond farm, but
complained that maintenance on the 12-man dorms costs up to $1,500
per month.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Reliable data on farm worker housing
is scarce.  A Monterey County Health Department survey found that
on-farm housing for workers in the Salinas Valley fell 60 percent
in the last 15 to 20 years.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">USDA's undersecretary for rural economic
and community development toured San Diego county on January 24,
1996.  An estimated 16,000 people live in shacks and other makeshift
labor camps.  Many are unauthorized workers employed by area nurseries
and farms.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">At least five farm workers were killed
in a van-car crash July 30 in Fresno county, the fourth fatal
crash in 1996 involving farm workers.  The farm workers were headed
for melon fields 70 miles away, illustrating that the shortage
of temporary housing for farm workers in rural areas encourages
many to commute long distances from the housing that they find.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">If water were more expensive, would California
farmers shift from water-intensive crops such as alfalfa to labor-intensive
crops such as cantaloupes?  A new report says not necessarily--crop
choice decisions depend on many factors, and crop changes induced
by more expensive water may not increase farm worker employment.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">The California Institute for Rural Studies
studied Mendota in a report entitled &quot;93640 At Risk.&quot;
 The report examined how area farmers adjusted to less irrigation
water between 1987 and 1992.  The city of Mendota is in Fresno
county, where crop sales jumped 16 percent despite less water,
but production costs, according to the report, rose 30 percent.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Of the 68 farming operations around Mendota
in 1987, 28 went out of business, and 10 new operations began.
 Land values fell, as acreage of high value fruits and vegetables
dropped. </FONT></TT>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">There are 14,000 migrant children in
the Fresno Unified School District.  One-third of the district's
78,000 students speak little or no English.  </FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">In response, the school district has
implemented a program called linguistic targeting, which places
limited English speaking students in a particular tract.  School
administrators argue that this helps them consolidate each school's
teaching resources so that teachers don't have to split their
time with students speaking many languages.  Some parents are
not happy that the district is segregating limited English proficient
students because they fear that their children are not receiving

Between 1989 and 1994, rural counties added a net 167,000 manufacturing

at Strawberry Farms in 1996</FONT></TT></A></H2>

<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">During the summer of 1996, UFW
efforts to organize strawberry pickers around Watsonville featured
prominently in news stories.  According to the AFL-CIO, the UFW
strawberry organizing effort is currently the largest union organizing
effort in the US, involving $2 million and 40 full-time organizers
to organize 15,000 farm workers employed on 270 strawberry farms.
 </FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">However, the campaign did not
lead to any UFW election victories.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">On August 6, 1996, the AFL-CIO's
Executive Council pledged matching funds to the UFW's strawberry
organizing campaign in California, and to the Teamsters apple
organizing campaign in Washington.  </FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">American unions need to recruit
an estimated 700 new members each day, or 250,000 per year, to
keep the percentage of US workers in unions at its current 15
percent level.  In 1995, US unions added about 100,000 new members.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">Currently, none of the strawberry
farms in California, which produced $552 million worth of strawberries
in 1995, 80 percent of US strawberries, have union contracts.
 California produced 68 million 12-pint trays of strawberries
in 1994, 60 million trays in 1995, and a projected 69 million
trays in 1996.  Each 12-pint tray is worth $4 to $10 at the farm
level.  California strawberry yields average about 57,000 pounds
per acre. </FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">The UFW is targeting large farms,
those with 100 or more acres, and packer-marketers such as Driscoll
Strawberry Associates, WellPict, Gargiulo Farms (owned by Monsanto),
and Naturipe that often make arrangements with ex-pickers to grow
three or six acres of strawberries on a sharecropping basis.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">The UFW filed over 35 notices
to take access to workers on strawberries, and filed 25 notices
of intent to organize, meaning that the union obtained authorization
cards from at least 10 percent of the workers, but there were
no union petitions for elections, which require that the union
present authorization cards from 50 percent of the workers employed
when employment is at least 50 percent of peak employment.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">During an August visit by Arturo
Rodriquez, UFW President, to a crew of some of 1,200 Gargiulo
Farms' workers, only one worker asked Rodriguez questions and
several told a reporter that they do not want or need a union.
 Despite the UFW's &quot;flexibility,&quot; most of the larger
strawberry growers hired labor consultants to oppose the union.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">According to the UFW, strawberry
pickers' wages have not been raised for 10 years, and most do
not have health insurance.  In one UFW fund-raising letter, the
UFW reportedly called strawberries La Fruta del Diablo (the fruit
of the devil) because so many growers allegedly break laws governing
wages and working conditions.  The most-recently arrived strawberry
pickers are Mixtec Indians from Oaxaca, many of whom are illegal
aliens.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">On September 1, the Sacramento
Bee ran a long story on the strawberry campaign, emphasizing that,
since Chavez died April 23, 1993, 47-year old Rodriguez has given
the UFW a youthful face but boosted the UFW's membership only
from 21,000 to 26,000.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">Housing and Urban Development
Secretary Henry Cisneros and AFL-CIO President John J. Sweeney
addressed the 2,000 farm workers attending the biennial UFW convention
September 1 in Fresno.  Cisneros urged legal immigrants to become
citizens, asserting that 70 percent of the legal immigrants who
would lose benefits under the new welfare law were eligible to
become US citizens.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">Sweeney praised the UFW for its
organizing efforts, and announced that strawberries would be boycotted
in 50 US cities. </FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">The New York Times (July 3) and
CNN (July 7) ran stories on the UFW's efforts to organize strawberry
pickers.  According to CNN, strawberry pickers have average hourly
earnings of $6, although the grower interviewed employed pickers
who averaged $9 to $10 per hour and offered the workers additional
fringe benefits.  Some strawberry pickers reportedly fear that
union elections might persuade some growers not to grow strawberries.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">On August 9, 1996, thousands of
farm workers reportedly marched through Watsonville to oppose
the UFW's organizing attempts.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">The strawberry industry was hit
by a health scare in June.  On June 8, 1996, Texas health officials
announced that they thought that California strawberries were
responsible for an outbreak of cyclospora, an intestinal disease,
and both strawberry shipments and prices fell, costing California
growers an estimated $15 to $20 million in lost revenue.  The
outbreak was eventually traced to raspberries imported from Guatemala.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">Profiles of UFW leaders emphasize
that most work for little pay--UFW President Rodriguez received
$6,362 in 1995, plus housing and reimbursement for expenses.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">Egg City, owned by Okura and Co.
of Tokyo, and once the largest egg-producing facility in the world,
with three million chickens, and 39 chicken houses each with 80,000
to 90,000 laying hens, is closing.  </FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">Egg City, located in Fillmore,
about 50 miles northwest of Los Angeles, was the scene of one
of the UFW's bitterest defeats in the 1980s.  The UFW was certified
as bargaining agent for Egg City workers on July 7, 1978 and,
after Egg City was sold to the Kroger grocery store chain in 1979,
the UFW-Kroger agreement in 1979 became the UFW's first poultry
contract.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">Kroger sold Egg City to the Careau
Group in May 1985.  The UFW contract with Egg City expired on
September 1, 1985.  Instead of discussing higher wages with the
UFW, Egg City's new owners argued that they were losing money
because they were paying about $2.50 hourly above the prevailing
wage in the industry.  </FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">There were nine months of negotiations
between September 1985 and May 1986, but there was no agreement
when, in May 1986, Egg City filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition.
 Egg City asked the bankruptcy court to cut wages for 240 UFW-represented
workers by $2 per hour, and the court approved the wage cut in
June 1986.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">On June 22, 1986, the UFW called
a strike at Egg City, and Egg City permanently replaced most of
the strikers.  The UFW mounted a consumer boycott against the
buyers of Egg City eggs, and in August 1986, McDonald's and grocery
store chains Ralph's and Von's stopped buying Egg City eggs. 
</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">Egg City sought an injunction
to stop UFW boycott activities, and asked to have the NLRB reclassify
about half of its workers as nonfarm workers.  An ALRB-supervised
decertification election was held at Egg City on November 3, 1986,
and in April 1988 the ALRB decertified the UFW as bargaining agent
for Egg City workers.  During the summer of 1993, the UFW and
Egg City privately settled a suit in which Egg City charged that
the UFW's boycott activities had cost it $6.6 million.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">On September 4, 1996, a crop duster
sprayed cotton and 22 grape pickers in an adjacent field were
hospitalized for pesticide poisoning.  Some 280 grape pickers
were employed on the grape ranch owned by Sun Pacific, a 3,000-acre
grape operation near Shafter, California.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">Miguel Contreras, a former UFW
organizer, was elected secretary-treasurer of the Los Angeles
County Federation of Labor in May 1996.  Contreras worked for
the UFW from the mid-1960s through 1977, and then organized hotel
and restaurant employees.  Half of the 650,000 positions in manufacturing
in Los Angeles county are filled by Hispanics.</FONT></TT>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">Investigations of 33 citrus operations

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">On October 2, a suit was filed
against the owner of two Lantana-based farms for failing to pay
the minimum wage of $4.25 per hour and not keeping employment

in an unsafe, uninsured vehicle.  One of the complainants was
injured in an accident in the vehicle.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">The federal government began to
regulate farm worker transportation in 1963, after an accident

that drivers of farm worker transport have valid licenses, have
their vehicles inspected and have insurance.  However, many drivers
apparently buy insurance and then cancel after one month, so that

 President Clinton on July 29, 1996 vetoed the TEAM Act, which
would have eased legal restrictions on &quot;employee involvement&quot;
programs in nonunion settings.  On July 10, the Senate, by a vote
of 53-46, approved the employer-backed TEAM Act (S 295), which
was strongly opposed by the AFL-CIO.  An identical bill narrowly
passed the House in September, 1995 by a vote of 221-202.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">In December 1992, the NLRB ruled
that Electromation had violated the NLRA by establishing five
committees in which five or six employees and one or two managers
discussed workplace issues.  The Teamsters, who were trying to
organize Electromation, charged that the company had established
an employer-sponsored labor organization to avoid unions.  The
TEAM Act would have clarified when employers can establish worker-management
teams.</FONT></TT>

 The federal-state Targeted Industries Partnership Program (TIPP)
was again active in California fields in 1996.  TIPP was created
in 1992 to promote cooperation between state and federal agencies
that enforce labor laws in the garment and agricultural industries.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">The goals of the TIPP program
are to level the playing field for all employers, to protect vulnerable
workers, and to ensure that appropriate taxes are collected. 
In 1994, it was estimated that California's underground or untaxed
economy involved $70 to $170 billion in annual transactions, and
that the US underground economy involved $500 to $800 billion
per year.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">There are reported to be growing
tensions between California and DOL TIPP teams.  On August 30,
1996, the US Department of Labor presented its first regional
Agricultural Employer of the Year award to tomato grower Harry
Singh &amp; Sons, in recognition of the farm's construction of
barracks housing in 1990 for 325 farm workers.  In 1991, the workers
were charged $16.50 a week for bunk beds in a communal sleeping
room -- and $44.80 a week for three hot meals a day.  Singh &amp;
Sons farms employs 400 to 900 workers to farm 700 acres.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">In granting the award, DOL noted
that Singh has not been cited for even a minor violation since
1978.  However, the California Labor Commissioner in August 1996
charged that Singh violated state labor law, and owed more than
$1 million in overtime pay to workers--under California law, farm
workers must receive overtime pay after 10 hours daily or 60 hours
weekly.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">In 1996, DOL threatened to invoke
the hot-goods rule of the Fair Labor Standards Act, Section 12a,
to seize farm commodities produced in violation of federal wage
and hour laws.  The threat was made as the garlic, onion and strawberry
industries continue to employ large numbers of children.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">Under the hot-goods rule, DOL
can seize goods that were produced with oppressive child labor
or on farms that repeatedly violate minimum wage laws.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">Cal/OSHA announced that it is
making growers jointly liable with contractors for on-the-job
injuries if the employer has any supervisory or control function
over the contractor's employees on his farm.  </FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">The Los Angeles Times reported
that there is growing tension between federal and state inspectors
on TIPP teams assigned to the garment industry.  TIPP has made
2,000 inspections, and levied $15 million in fines, in an industry
with 6,000 registered sewing contractors and 158,000 employees.
 In the garment industry, California TIPP inspectors are beginning
to do more inspections without their federal partners.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">An IRS agriculture enforcement
team has discovered cases in the Fresno area in which growers
paid farm labor contractors only workers' wages of $5 per hour
and no commission to cover the cost of required social security,
unemployment insurance and workers' compensation taxes.  There
are an estimated $200 million in unpaid agriculture employment
taxes in the San Joaquin Valley, and IRS section 3505 permits
the IRS to levy penalties against growers who knowingly pay farm
labor contractors too little for them to pay employment taxes.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">Since California began requiring
that FLCs seeking to renew their licenses include IRS Form 8821
to assure that they have paid appropriate employment taxes, the
IRS has determined that 117 of 279 FLCs renewing their licenses,
or 42 percent, owed payroll taxes.</FONT></TT>

</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">The Agricultural Labor
Relations Board on September 22, 1996 issued two decisions on
the access of union organizers to workers on farms.  In Gargiulo,
22 ALRB 9, the employer asserted that five UFW organizers violated
the time and number rules that regulate access, disrupted harvesting
activities, and damaged crops, and asked that the ALRB ban the
UFW from taking access for 60 days.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">The ALRB ordered hearings to be
held on the employer declarations, made under penalty of perjury,
that allege the union significantly disrupted agricultural operations,
intentionally harassed employers or employees, or intentionally
disregarded the access rules.  In the meantime, UFW organizers
retain the right to take access to Gargiulo workers.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">In Navarro Farms, 22 ALRB 10,
the employer declared that UFW organizers took access to its Casserly
Ranch July 25, 1996 but, instead of talking to workers, they inspected
toilet and drinking water facilities and, Navarro declared, told
employees that they were from Cal-OSHA.  The ALRB ordered a hearing
on whether the UFW organizers, acting on instructions from the
UFW office in Watsonville, used access to conduct a safety inspection
rather than to communicate with employees.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">The Agricultural Labor Relations
Act, enacted in 1975, does not deal with the access of non-employee
union organizers to workers employed on farms.  Under the NLRA,
the NLRB decides on a case-by-case basis whether union organizers
should have access to the work site where employees are working.
 This means that, in the nonfarm private sector, unions petition
the NLRB for access to employees on a ship, or an isolated resort
hotel or a logging camp.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">The ALRB reviewed the California
farm labor market and concluded that unions routinely asked for
access to farm workers, and the ALRB would normally grant them
access.  The ALRB justified presumptive access on the grounds
that many farm workers live and work on employer property; that
workers who enter and leave a farm come and go at different points,
so that there is no single public place for organizers to wait
to talk to them; and that worker characteristics, including little
education and lack of English, limit the ability of organizers
to effectively communicate with workers through printed literature,
radio, or other media.  After much litigation, the ALRB access
rule was upheld by the California and U.S. Supreme Courts (Superior
Farms-Pandol v. ALRB, 429 U.S. 802, 1976).</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">The ALRB access<U> </U>rules limit
non-employee union organizers by number and time.  After the union
files with the ALRB a Notice of Intent to Take Access (NA), up
to two organizers can come and go on the farm for the first 30&nbsp;workers,
and then one organizer for each additional 15 workers.  Union
organizers enter a farm for a maximum three hours per day--one
hour before work, during lunch, and after work, for up to four
30-day periods per year.</FONT></TT>

 On July 30, 1996, the ALRB issued Dole Farming Company, 22 ALRB
8 (1996), upholding an Administrative Law Judge decision that
Dole had unlawfully fired and refused to rehire 18 members of
a spraying crew who protested a new work schedule.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">Dole Farming Company is the Bakersfield-based
grape, tree fruit, and citrus part of Dole Food Company.  On May
10, 1994, foreman Martinez told two spray crews that half of each
crew would work the following day, and the other on May 12, and
that the full crews would return to work through the weekend.
 This changed established practices, in which Dole's spray crews
often worked 14 to 16 hours per day for seven days each week from
May through July.  </FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">Farm workers in California are
entitled to 1.5 times their usual pay for hours in excess of 10
per day and 60 per week, and two times their pay for hours in
excess of eight hours per day on the seventh consecutive day of
work.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">The spraying crew protested that,
if they were not going to get the seventh day overtime, because
of the day off, they wanted the day off to be Sunday, not in the
middle of the week.  The crew demanded a meeting with ranch manager
Lopez, and he told them that they would have to abide by the work
schedule that the company made or leave.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">The workers decided that either
all or none would return to work, but that, before accepting the
new schedule, they would demand an increase in pay for clean-up
work and work equipment.  However, before they got a chance to
discuss these issues with Lopez, the 10 names of workers who were
supposed to work May 10, 1994 were read out and all refused to
work.  </FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">Lopez testified that he heard
a worker ask for checks, and that they should go home, and return
for their checks in several hours.  Lopez returned with the checks
several hours later.<B>  </B></FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">Two days later, on May 12, 1994,
one worker returned and requested his old job, and he returned
again on May 13.  On each occasion he was told not yet, and Dole
never contacted him about his job.  Dole does not have a seniority
list, and never contacted any ex-members of the spray crew about
their jobs.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">The ALJ decided, and the ALRB
affirmed, that Dole committed an 1153(a) Unfair Labor Practice
by firing and refusing to rehire the spray crew members who had
engaged in protected concerted activity, i.e., refusing to work
under the new work schedule.  </FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">Under the ALRA, employees who
engage in protected concerted activities can be disciplined, but
not fired.  In many non-union settings, workers engage in spontaneous
strikes, meaning that they refuse to work in order to, e.g.  protest
a new work schedule.  Such striking workers can be replaced, but
they cannot be fired for protesting.  </FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">Replacement means that the employer
announces jobs are vacant and they are open to be filled by temporary
or permanent replacement workers.  If the strikers return to work,
they must be rehired without prejudice for engaging in a protest
over wages and working conditions.  Firing means that the employer
leaves a job vacant rather than rehiring a returning striker.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">In S&amp;S Ranch, 22 ALRB 7 (1996),
the ALRB on July 18, 1996 overturned an ALJ decision that 27 employees
who refused to work after S&amp;S did not grant them a $0.25 raise
were economic strikers that the employer improperly failed to
rehire when they offered to return to work at the old wage.  </FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">S&amp;S Ranch is a Mendota-based
cotton ranch, and on July 20, 1994, 27 members of foreman Soto's
irrigation crew asked for a $0.25 raise, which Soto refused, as
did the ranch manager.  The workers went to the EDD office in
Mendota, which told them it could not help them, but that S&amp;S
had called to ask for replacement workers.  Soto later visited
the EDD office, but was unable to obtain replacement workers.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">The irrigation workers returned
to S&amp;S, where personnel manager Blanco said that there were
a few vacancies left, and that they should apply to Soto for jobs.
 After gathering more workers, they spoke with the ranch manager,
with Blanco acting as interpreter, who also rejected their request
for a $0.25 raise.  </FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">The workers returned to EDD, and
then to the ranch.  According to the workers, Blanco told them
to go and talk to foreman Soto, who was responsible for hiring
his own crew.  Soto told at least one worker that it was too late
to go to work on July 20, but to return the next day.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">A few workers returned to work
on July 21, and most were back to work on July 22.  The ALJ decided
that the complaining workers were not rehired on July 20, when
they offered to return to work, and thus were owed make-whole
wages for the missed days of work.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">The ALRB overturned the ALJ's
decision, reasoning that the workers were economic strikers, 
and that Blanco's July 20 mid-day instruction to go and talk to
Soto about getting their jobs back was &quot;an adequate offer
of reinstatement.&quot;</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">Economic strikers lose wages and
potentially their jobs, since the employer can permanently replace
economic strikers.  Unfair labor practice strikers, by contrast,
are entitled to back pay and their old jobs.  </FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">The S&amp;S workers initially
claimed that they were unlawfully fired for engaging in protected
concerted activities, i.e., asking for a $0.25 raise.  The ALJ
concluded that they were economic strikers, and that they were
owed back wages for the day or two after they offered to return
to work and before they were reinstated.  The ALRB overturned
the ALJ's decision, and said that S&amp;S offered to rehire the
strikers on the day that they protested and then returned to work.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><U><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">Peak Employment</FONT></U><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">.
 In July 1994, 107 farm workers at the Gallo winery in Sonoma
county voted 4 to 1 to have the UFW represent them, and the ALRB
certified the UFW as bargaining representative for Gallo's Sonoma
farm workers.  In April 1996, a state superior court ruled that
the election was not valid because Gallo expanded its operations,
and thus employment was not 50 percent of the peak 250 that Gallo
estimated would be employed in 1994, as the ALRA requires.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">However, in 1994, Gallo hired
a peak 175 workers, so that the winery was at peak employment
in July when the election was held.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">On August 27, 1996, the 5th District
Court of Appeal in Fresno reinstated the UFW election victory
at the Gallo winery, ruling that California judges can set aside
elections only when the ALRB makes a clear legal error, which
it did not do in this case.  The Appeals Court rejected the first
judge's ruling that the ALRB is required to base peak employment
levels on statewide estimates of acreage and labor needs.</FONT></TT>

<A NAME="_Toc369261905"><TT><U><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">US-Illegal
Aliens.</FONT></U></TT></A><TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">  By
a voice vote, the House of Representatives on July 11-12, 1996
approved a rider to the $145 million appropriation for the NLRB
that bars the NLRB from expending funds &quot;on behalf of an
employee not lawfully entitled to be present and employed in the
United States.&quot;  </FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">Those who supported the rider
argued that the NLRB should not be able to order US employers
to provide back pay to aliens who should not be in the US.  </FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">NLRB Chairman William B. Gould
opposed the rider, and members of Congress who argued against
it noted that it may give US employers an incentive to hire unauthorized
alien workers, since they would not be entitled to back pay if
the employer unlawfully acts against them.  Several members of
Congress argued that, if the unauthorized worker cannot receive
back pay, at least the employer should be required to pay the
US Treasury the funds that cannot be received by the unauthorized
worker.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">If this provision survives the
conference committee, the NLRB could not order employers to provide
back pay for unauthorized workers for any period in which they
were not lawfully in the United States.  The US Supreme Court,
in a 1984 decision, Sure-Tan v. NLRB, 467 U.S. 883 (1984), held
that the NLRB acted reasonably in interpreting the word &quot;employee&quot;
in the National Labor Relations Act to include unauthorized aliens
(116 LRRM 2857).  </FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">The Court in Sure-Tan held that
the exclusion of undocumented alien employees from participation
in union activities and the protection against employer intimidation
would create a kind of subclass of workers which would erode the
unity of all employees and impede effective collective bargaining.
 However, in the Sure-Tan case, the unauthorized workers left
the US.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">The NLRB in December 1995 reaffirmed
the right of two unauthorized workers to receive back pay in APRA
Fuel Oil Buyers Group Inc, 320 NLRB No. 53 (December 21, 1995).
 In this case, APRA fired six union supporters, two of whom were
unauthorized aliens.  </FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">The NLRB majority decision concluded
that &quot;the most effective way for the Board to accommodate--and
indeed to further--the immigration policies IRCA embodies is,
to the extent possible, to provide the protections and remedies
of the NLRA to undocumented workers in the same manner as to other
employees...[to avoid giving] incentives for some unscrupulous
employers to play the provisions of the NLRA and IRCA against
each other to defeat the fundamental objectives of each, while
profiting from their own wrongdoing with relative impunity.&quot;</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">The NLRB in APRA held that unauthorized
workers were entitled to backpay and reinstatement if they could
produce, within a reasonable time, documents enabling the employer
to meet its obligation under IRCA [the Immigration Reform and
Control Act of 1986] to verify their eligibility for employment
in the United States.&quot;  Thus, the unauthorized workers unlawfully
fired by APRA are entitled to backpay from the date of discharge
to the earlier of (1) their reinstatement, including their compliance
with IRCA, or (2) the workers' failure, after a reasonable time,
to produce documents establishing eligibility to work in the US.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">The US Supreme Court in February
1996 refused to review this NLRB decision.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">In New York, a federal judge enforced
an arbitration award requiring the grocery chain A&amp;P to reinstate
an employee who had given a false name and other false information
on his job application to conceal the fact that he was an illegal
alien (The Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Co. v. Local No. 338,
Retail, Wholesale &amp; Department Store Union, DC SNY, No. 95
Civ. 5255, May 28, 1996).  </FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">The employee was an illegal alien
when he applied for a job in 1986, became a legal resident in
1989, and a naturalized US citizen in 1994.  The union agreement
allows A&amp;P to discharge employees for dishonesty.  The arbitrator
held that nine years of employment more than offset the dishonesty
about legal status in 1986.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<A NAME="_Toc369261906"><TT><U><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">US-Joint
Employment.</FONT></U></TT></A><TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">
 A federal Appeals Court in July 1996 ruled that over 600 bean
pickers in south Florida can collect as much as $2 per hour between
1986 and 1989 from a grower who used a contractor to supply workers.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">On July 19, 1996, the US Court
of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit modified its 1994 ruling that
set out the parameters for joint employment in labor contractor-grower
situations.  In Antenor v D &amp; S Farms, 88 F.3d 925; 1996 U.S.
App, Antenor and over 600 other mostly Haitian women who picked
beans in south Florida sought back wages from both the labor contractor,
Ag-Tech Services, and D&amp;S Farms, and the court ruled that
D&amp;S was a joint employer, and thus jointly liable for the
back pay, because its supervisors were involved in managing the
workers.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">According to the winning attorney,
this means that growers in most circumstances will be considered
joint employers with contractors unless the contractor has true
&quot;absolute, sole, and unfettered control&quot; over the workers,
and has a substantial investment in equipment and facilities.
 Some speculate that this may be the biggest farm labor back pay
case ever.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">In the mid-1980s, farmers growing
snap beans for the fresh market turned to Ag-Tech Services, a
labor contractor, to get the beans picked for $3.90 per box, minus
$0.11 per box for grower-paid workers compensation.  Growers determined
when and where to pick, then contacted Ag-Tech Services, which
sent the crew to their field.  However, picking did not begin
until the grower or his supervisor gave approval.  Pickers were
supervised by one Ag-Tech Services and one grower field boss.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">Growers issued two checks to Ag-Tech
Services:  one for Social Security taxes, and one for the remainder
of the $3.90 per box fee.  Ag-Tech Services, in turn, paid its
supervisors, and the supervisors paid the pickers, in some cases
deducting for the cost of transportation to the fields.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">The bean pickers sued, charging,
among other things, that D&amp;S Farms and Ag-Tech Services did
not keep accurate records of hours worked and production, and
that, in some cases, workers received as little as $2 per hour
for their work.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">A federal district court ruled
that the farm workers could not sue D&amp;S Farms, because D&amp;S
Farms was not a joint employer with Ag-Tech Services.  DOL uses
five factors to determine whether there is a joint employment
relationship: the nature and degree of control of the workers,
the degree of supervision of the work, the power to determine
the pay rates or the methods of payment, the right to hire and
fire and the payment of wages.  In addition, the court held that
three other factors are relevant--does the grower own the facilities
where the work occurs, is the workers' work integral to the production
process, and what is the grower's and labor contractor's relative
investment in equipment and facilities?</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">In reviewing these eight factors,
the Court found that D&amp;S Farms told Ag Tech how many pickers
to bring to the field and determined when picking was to begin,
that D&amp;S Farms supervisors talked directly to workers about
the quality of their work, and that D&amp;S Farms at one point
told Ag Tech to stop all picking until the pickers obtained identification
cards from the South Florida Vegetable Association.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">According to the court in Antenor,
MSPA was intended to hold &quot;agricultural employers' fully
accountable as joint employers whenever the facts suggest that
liability is fairly imposed,&quot; which implies that, if in doubt,
the courts will assume that there is a joint employment relationship.</FONT></TT>

<A NAME="_Toc369261907"><TT><U><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">US-Bargaining.</FONT></U></TT></A><TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">
 The US Supreme Court ruled, in an 8-1 decision announced on June
20, that employers who bargain jointly with unions are shielded
from charges that they are violating antitrust laws when they
impose new wages and benefits on workers after collective bargaining
agreements expire.  About 40 percent of all US collective bargaining
agreements covering 1,000 or more workers involve so-called &quot;multiemployer
bargaining&quot; in which participating employers appoint a committee

and Welfare Changes</FONT></TT><FONT SIZE=5> </FONT></A></H2>

<P>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">In 1996, three major pieces of legislation
were signed into law that will affect immigrants: the Anti-Terrorism
and Effective Death Penalty Act, signed into law on April 24,
1996, the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation
Act, signed into law on August 22, 1996, and the Immigration Control
and Financial Responsibility Act, signed into law on September
30, 1996.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">A fourth new law, the Small Business
Job Protection Act of 1996, increased the minimum wage from $4.25
to $4.75 hourly on October 1, 1996, and to $5.15 per hour on September
1, 1997.</FONT></TT>
<H3><A NAME="_Toc370012912"><TT>Immigration Changes </TT></A>
</H3>

<P>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">The immigration bill includes three major
sets of measures to reduce illegal immigration and reduce the
access of legal immigrants to welfare.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">First, it provides for more border enforcement,
adding 1,000 Border Patrol agents per year for five years, bringing
the total from 5,175 in 1996 to almost 10,000 by the year 2000.
The new immigration law also requires INS to build a 14-mile triple
fence on the US-Mexican border south of San Diego, and increases
penalties for smuggling aliens into the US and for using false
documents to obtain US jobs or welfare assistance.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">The new law also adds 1,200 INS investigators,
the agents who inspect US work places for unauthorized workers,
and apprehend and deport criminal aliens.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Second, it introduces a pilot telephone
verification program to enable employers to verify the status
of newly-hired workers, and social service agencies to determine
the legal status of applicants for benefits. However, employer
participation in the verification program is voluntary, and no
national worker eligibility verification system that mandates
employer participation could be established without new legislation.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">The new law includes incentives for states
to develop counterfeit-resistant driver's licenses and birth certificates.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">The new legislation makes it easier for
employers to defend themselves against suits from job applicants
who believe that they were discriminated against by employers
checking their legal status. Job applicants who believe that employers
checking their legal status discriminated against them must now
prove that the employer intended to discriminate. </FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Employers will not have to forfeit their
business assets if they repeatedly hire illegal aliens.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Third, the immigration bill expands and
reinforces restrictions on the access of LEGAL immigrants to welfare
benefits. Non-US citizens were barred from Food Stamp assistance
and Supplemental Security Income by the welfare law enacted in
August 1996, but that law left it to states to decide whether
to permit legal immigrants to participate in Medicaid, medical
assistance for the poor.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">President Clinton's last minute negotiations
preserved the right of states to offer Medicaid to non-US citizens,
including for the treatment of AIDS. Persons with AIDS are not
allowed to immigrate but, once in the US, Medicaid can pay for
their treatment.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Clinton also got a provision dropped
that would have subjected to deportation immigrants who received
means-tested federal welfare assistance, including AFDC and Medicaid,
for more than 12 months during their first seven years in the
US. </FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">To make it less likely that immigrants
will request welfare assistance after their arrival, US sponsors
will have to have higher incomes. </FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Sponsors of immigrants now have to have
an income at least equal to the poverty line, $15,569 for a family
of four in 1995. Under the new immigration law, US citizens who
want to bring spouses and minor children into the US will have
to have incomes that are 125 percent of the poverty line, $19,461,
down from 140 percent in the House-approved bill. Sponsors are
allowed to include the partial value of assets such as cars and
homes to reach this level.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">In 1994, about 36 percent of the sponsors
of immediate relatives had incomes that were less than 140 percent
of the poverty line, and 44 percent of those who sponsored parents
and adult siblings had incomes less than 200 percent of the poverty
line.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">One of the most contentious issues in
the immigration bill was the Gallegly amendment, which would have
allowed states to deny illegal alien children free K-12 education.
A 5-4 US Supreme Court decision in 1982, Plyler v Doe, requires
states to provide K-12 education to illegal alien children.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">The House approved the Gallegly amendment
by a vote of 254 to 175 on September 25, 1996. The Senate did
not consider the Gallegly amendment.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Farm employers won a General Accounting
Office study of the H-2A program. In the next Congress, farm employers
plan to push for a new guest worker program.</FONT></TT>
<H3><A NAME="_Toc370012913"><TT>Welfare Changes</TT> </A></H3>

<P>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">The new welfare law makes most legal
and illegal immigrants ineligible for welfare assistance. To obtain
maximum federal payments, states have an incentive to implement
the new welfare law as quickly as possible.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">An estimated one million legal immigrants,
including 400,000 in California, are expected to lose about $4
billion per year in welfare benefits they are now receiving, an
average $4,000 each.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Under the new welfare law, foreigners
are grouped into three major categories for the purpose of determining
their access to welfare assistance:</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">-Legal immigrants who have worked in
the US for at least 40 quarters (10 years), are veterans or members
of the Armed Forces, or have been admitted as refugees, retain
access to welfare as before.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">- &quot;qualified aliens,&quot;--most
legal immigrants--are not eligible for specific means-tested federal
benefit programs for a five-year period after their entry into
the United States.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">-&quot;non-qualified aliens&quot; are
unauthorized or illegal aliens and some categories of non-immigrants
who have INS permission to remain in the US, such as aliens with
Temporary Protected Status (TPS) or Persons Residing under Color
of Law (PRUCOL). They are not eligible for most federal public
benefits, or for many state and local public benefits. </FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">The assistance programs to which legal
immigrants continue to gain access are primarily those that deliver
in-kind services, such as soup kitchens, or those that provide
emergency help, such as violence and abuse prevention programs.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Courts may slow the removal of immigrants
from welfare programs, since lawyers are preparing to sue states
as they remove immigrants from the welfare rolls. A major argument
will be that the new welfare law unconstitutionally discriminates
against a class of people -- immigrants who have not become citizens
-- when it cuts off their Supplemental Security Income and food
stamp benefits. Under the 14th Amendment to the US constitution,
the equal protection under the law amendment, governments may
not discriminate on the basis of, inter alia, national origin.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">More immigrants receive assistance under
Food Stamps than any other welfare program. In most states, immigrants
applying for Food Stamps for the first time near the end of September
1996 were rejected.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Those receiving Food Stamps must have
their need for them re-certified at least once each year. President
Clinton directed USDA to permit all states to keep immigrants
currently on Food Stamp rolls until August 22, 1997, one year
after the welfare law was signed.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">California has 3.2 million Food Stamp
recipients, including 436,000 legal immigrants. They currently
receive benefits worth an average of $182 per month. About 373,000
immigrants will not be eligible for the program once the welfare
law is implemented. </FONT></TT>

<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">As the number of newly-naturalized
US citizens surpassed 1.1 million in FY96, Republicans stepped
up their attacks on Citizenship USA, the INS-administered initiative
launched by Vice President Gore in 1995 to eliminate the backlog
of immigrants who applied for US citizenship.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">Republicans charged that expedited
naturalization was an attempt by the Clinton Administration to
add Democrats to the voter rolls in California and other key states
before the November 1996 elections.  The INS officer in Fresno,
for example, said in an April 1996 letter that the &quot;INS has
been told to naturalize everyone who filed form N-400 prior to
April 1, 1996, in time for them to register to vote in the November
election.&quot;</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">A Gore staffer complained on March
28, 1996 that INS headquarters was hindering efforts to produce
&quot;a million new voters by election day,&quot; and suggested
that he should become INS Deputy Commissioner to speed up naturalization.
 The INS eventually granted its district managers in some cities
the authority to waive some INS rules and regulations to speed
up naturalizations.</FONT></TT>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">One memo prepared by Vice President
Gore's office discusses way to &quot;lower the standards for citizenship.&quot;

<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">In California, immigrants eager
to naturalize are often bilked by notarios, non-lawyer paralegals
who sometimes operate from fancy leased offices, collect thousands

</H2>

<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">There were about 100 million &quot;consumer
units&quot; in the US, and they spent an average $30,700 in 1993,
up from $29,800 in 1992.  </FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">The five largest expenditure items
were housing, $9,600; transportation, $5,500; food, $4,400 (14
percent); personal taxes, $3,000; and personal insurance and pensions,
$2,900.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">Food expenditures included $2,700
for food eaten at home, or nine percent of total expenditures.
 The major items were meat and poultry, which averaged $735; fruits
and vegetables, $445; cereals and bread, $435; and, dairy products;
$295.  In addition, consumer units spent an average $225 on non-alcoholic
beverages and $270 on alcoholic beverages.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">Spending on fresh fruits and vegetables
represents about 10 percent of average consumer unit expenditures
on food-- about $135 each for fresh fruits and for fresh vegetables,
or a total $270 for the commodities most likely to use immigrant
farm labor.  </FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">Farmers obtained an average 24
percent of the retail price of food consumed at home in 1993--or
about $650.  The farmer's share of the retail food dollar ranged
from a low of about seven percent for grains used in cereal and
bakery products, to 40 to 48 percent for poultry, eggs and beef.
 </FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">Farmers received about 19 percent
of the average retail price for fresh fruits ($26), and 23 percent
of the retail price of fresh vegetables ($31)--farmers get $57
or 21 percent of the $270 spent on fresh fruits and vegetables.
 Farm labor, including supervisory labor, typically represents
about one-third of farmers' costs of production for fresh fruits
and vegetables.  In other words, farm labor represents about $8.60
of the $26 that the farmer gets from what the average US consumer
unit spends on fresh fruit, and $10.20 of the $31 the farmer gets
from US consumer unit spending on fresh vegetables.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">Suppose that immigration holds
farm wages 50 percent below the level they would otherwise be,
so that current wages of $5 to $6 per hour would be $7.50 to $9
per hour.  And suppose that the entire cost of higher farm wages
is passed through to consumers, so that the cost of farm labor
to produce fresh fruit rises $4.40 to $13, and the cost of farm
labor to produce fresh vegetables rises $5 to $15.  If these increased
farm labor costs were passed through to consumers, spending on
fresh fruits and vegetables eaten at home would rise by less than
four percent (almost $10) from $270 to $280.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">In addition to food eaten at home,
the average consumer unit spends $1,700 on food eaten away from
home.  It is difficult to calculate the food cost of food eaten
away from home--some of the total cost of restaurant meals reflects
services and atmosphere.  If 10 percent of away from home food
is for fresh fruits and vegetables, another $170 is spent on them,
and the farm share of remains at 21 percent or $36, and farm labor
represents 33 percent or $12, then a 50 percent increase in farm
labor costs would raise spending on fresh fruits and vegetables
eaten away from home by $6, from $170 to $176.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">The total increase in consumer
unit spending on food if farm wages were to rise by 50 percent
as a result of immigration changes, assuming all of the increased
costs were passed through to consumers, would be about $16 per
year.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><U><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">Per capita consumption</FONT></U><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">.
USDA estimates the &quot;disappearance&quot; of various types
of food.  In 1994, per capita food disappearance was 1,782 pounds
per person, excluding alcoholic drinks.  Not all of this food
was eaten; some was thrown away, but it is often said that the
average American &quot;eats&quot; about 1,800 pounds of food per
year, or about five pounds per day.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">The per capita disappearance of
major food items includes:  dairy products, 586 pounds, meat and
poultry, 194 pounds, flour and cereals, 199 pounds, and sugar
and sweeteners, 148 pounds.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">Per capita disappearance of fruits
and vegetables totaled about 470 pounds, including 240 pounds
of vegetables, 150 pounds of fruit, and 77 pounds of potatoes.
 Many fruits and vegetables are consumed after they are processed,
such as canned or frozen--per capita fresh produce consumption
was about 305 pounds per person, including 114 pounds of vegetables,
48 pounds of potatoes and 127 pounds of fruit.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">The fresh vegetable consumption
included 27 pounds of lettuce--23 pounds of head lettuce and four
pounds of leaf lettuce.  A head of lettuce weighs about two pounds.
 The next most important vegetables, by weight, were tomatoes,
16 pounds per person in 1994, cabbage, 10 pounds, and carrots
and sweet corn, eight pounds each.</FONT></TT>

</A></H2>

<P>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">The US farm value of fresh vegetables
and melons was $7.4 billion in 1995, and Florida's production
of six winter fresh vegetables--tomatoes, bell peppers, cucumbers,
snap beans, eggplant, and squash--represented about 10 percent
of the total.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Florida produced 2.5 billion pounds of
these six fresh vegetables in 1995, other states produced 3.8
billion pounds, and 2.6 billion pounds were imported--about three-fourths
of these fresh vegetable imports were from Mexico. Mexico exported
about $1.5 billion of fruits and vegetables in 1995, including
$600 million of tomatoes.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">The US imported $3.1 billion worth of
horticultural products from its NAFTA partners in 1995, including
$400 million worth of Mexican tomatoes. About 80 percent of Mexican
horticultural imports were fresh produce, versus 50 percent of
Canadian imports.</FONT></TT>
<H3><A NAME="_Toc370012919"><TT>Tomatoes</TT> </A></H3>

<P>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">In April 1996, Florida tomato producers
filed a petition alleging that Mexico &quot;dumped&quot; tomatoes
in the US at less than their cost of production--they needed only
show that there was &quot;some injury&quot; from imported tomatoes
to win this case. The US Department of Commerce investigated to
determine, e.g., whether Mexican tomatoes were sold at the same
prices in Canada, Mexico, and the US in 1995-96, and planned to
issue its decision on October 7, 1996.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">However, the Commerce Department announced
it was suspending the anti-dumping case on October 11, 1996, because
Mexico agreed to a price floor for its tomato exports--Mexican
growers would charge at least $0.21 per pound, or $5.17 for a
25-pound box for their tomatoes shipped to the US--and Florida
growers agreed to suspend their dumping case. Mexican growers
must ratify the agreement.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Before the decision, Mexican growers
predicted that a 30 percent anti-dumping tariff would eliminate
500,000 jobs in Mexico.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Many observers expected Florida to win
the dumping case, largely because the Clinton administration,
in a bid for Florida's 25 electoral votes, permitted the Florida
growers to mix two marketing years in providing data on Florida
and Mexican costs of production and market shares. The Florida
Department of Agriculture spent $1.5 million to press the tomato-growers'
complaints against Mexican tomatoes.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">If Florida had won the dumping case,
the US could have imposed dumping sanctions on Mexican tomatoes,
adding, for example, a 10 percent &quot;dumping margin&quot; to
the tomatoes imported in 1996-97. </FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Mexico could have retaliated against
US-produced goods, the $3 billion worth apparel and wood products
that the US exported to Mexico in 1995 were suggested.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">On July 2, 1996, the International Trade
Commission rejected by a 4-1 vote a petition from Florida growers
that alleged that the US winter tomato and pepper industries were
being &quot;substantially hurt&quot; by normal tomato and pepper
imports from Mexico, Canada, and the Netherlands. If the ITC had
agreed that US producers were being &quot;substantially&quot;
hurt by imports, President Clinton could have imposed increased
tariffs or taken other steps to limit imports under Section 201
of the Trade Act.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">The 16.5 pounds of fresh tomatoes that
the average American eats each year, include about 4.6 pounds
produced in Florida, seven pounds produced in other states, especially
California, and 4.6 imported pounds, usually from Mexico.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">During the first 10 months of 1995, Mexican
agricultural exports to the United States, excluding grains, rose
by 42 percent to $ 2.9 billion, while US agricultural exports
to Mexico fell 44 percent to $ 724 million. Mexico supplies about
three-fourths of the imported vegetables consumed in the US, and
Mexican-born workers are about three-fourths of the US hand-harvest
vegetable labor force.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">In the winter of 1996, prices for 25-pound
boxes of tomatoes fell from the usual $10 to $12 to $3, below
the $8 cost of production in Florida, and the $6 cost of production
in Mexico. Florida planted 47,000 acres of tomatoes in 1995, and
harvested 14 billion pounds of tomatoes. In 1995, the US imported
1.3 billion pounds of tomatoes from Mexico worth $400 million.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Florida and Mexico compete for less than
half the year--for the five months between December and April--with
the most severe competition in February-March. Most observers
attribute Florida's falling share of the winter vegetable market
to weather and to Mexico's &quot;correct&quot; technological choices.
</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Until the early 1990s, both Florida and
Mexico produced mostly &quot;mature green&quot; tomatoes, which
means that green tomatoes were picked into buckets, sorted and
packed into cartons, and then gassed to turn them pink before
being shipped to retail stores. However, Mexico began in the 1990s
to plant &quot;vine-ripe&quot; tomato varieties that can be picked
pink, and reportedly taste better than mature green tomatoes.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">On September 24, the House Agriculture
Committee's Risk Management and Specialty Crops Subcommittee held
a hearing on the Florida growers trade complaints in Lantana,
Florida. At the hearing, it was asserted that Florida tomato workers
have average hourly earnings of $6.77 per hour, and that Mexican
pickers average $0.50 per hour. About one-third of tomato production
costs are for labor.</FONT></TT>
<H3><A NAME="_Toc370012920"><TT>Avocados</TT> </A></H3>

<P>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Mexico produces about 45 percent of the
world's avocados, some 800,000 tons per year from almost 220,000
acres, but Mexican avocados have been banned from the US since
1914. Some 100,000 workers are employed on 8,000 avocado farms
in Michocan, which produces about 85 percent of Mexican avocados
and is one the major states of origin for Mexican migrants headed
to the US.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">California has about 6,000 avocado growers
and 65,000 acres of avocados, up sharply from 20,000 acres in
1960. San Diego county produces about half of all US avocados,
which were worth $250 million in 1994. Mexico has both higher
yields and lower costs--average Mexican yields are about one-third
higher than California yields, 7.6 tons per hectare, versus five
tons per hectare in the US.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">As a result of the ban on Mexican avocados
in the US, a box of US-grown avocados in the US sells for about
$30, while a box of Mexican-grown avocados in Canada sells for
about $8.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">The US imports about one percent of its
annual avocado consumption, and Mexico exports about five percent
of the avocados it produces. </FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">In 1994, the USDA proposed to lift the
ban on imported Mexican avocados. Mexican growers certified to
ship avocados to the US would have their trees inspected in Mexico
and USDA personnel would also check for pests in packing plants.
Mexican growers would pay for these USDA inspections. </FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Under the proposal, Mexican avocados
could be imported only to 19 Midwest and Northeastern states during
the months of November to February, when the cold weather should
prevent any of the pests from surviving.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">If the import ban were lifted, one simulation
projected a four to eight percent decrease in US avocado acreage
and a drop of 10 to 20 percent in US avocado prices.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">The ban on Mexican avocados was expected
to be lifted in November 1996, but California avocado growers
spent $300,000 on newspaper ads to persuade USDA to continue to
study the issue of pests slipping past inspectors, surviving the
New England winter and wreaking havoc in California. The delay
will likely mean that no Mexican avocados can be imported until
November 1997.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">USDA regulations on avocado imports require
that there be an &quot;absence of infestations of injurious insects
known to attack fruits and vegetables&quot; in the area of origin
of the fruit during the 12 months before importation.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">A box of Mexican avocados sells for about
$8 in Canada, while a box of US avocados in the US sells for $30.
Canadians pay $0.50 to $0.60 per Mexican avocado in retail stores,
while US consumers often pay $1 each for California avocados.
About five percent of Mexico's fresh avocados are exported.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Mexicans consume about four times more
fresh produce per capita than Americans, in part because fewer
Mexican have the freezers and microwaves associated with frozen
vegetables.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Costa Rica supplied 25 percent of the
8.5 billion pounds of US banana imports in 1995.</FONT></TT>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">The farm value of fruits and nuts,
vegetables and melons and horticultural specialties such as mushrooms
and greenhouse/nursery crops totaled a record $34 billion in 1995,
including $10.5 billion worth of fruits and nuts, $13.3 billion
worth of vegetables, and $10.2 billion worth of specialties such
as flowers, garden plants and bulbs and Christmas trees.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">The US exported $9 billion worth
of FVH commodities in 1995, and FVH exports are expected to hit
almost $10 billion in 1997.  US farm exports, by contrast, are
expected to be $58 billion in 1997.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">About one-third of the value of
greenhouse/nursery crops are floriculture--cut flowers and bedding
and garden plants.  The US ($2.4 billion in farm sales in 1994,
and $3.3 billion in 1995) is second only to the Netherlands ($2.4
billion in 1994) in global floriculture production.  Italy, Germany
and other European countries also have significant floriculture
sectors, but the growth in floriculture is fastest in Latin America
(Colombia and Ecuador), Africa (Morocco and Kenya), Israel and
Asia (Thailand and Malaysia).</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">The US has about 10,000 floriculture
operations, and they have 843 million square feet under glass,
and 27,000 acres of open air production.  Geraniums worth $140
million to growers were the most valuable of the potted plants,
which had a grower value of $1.3 billion in 1995.  Cut flowers
were worth $521  million to growers in 1995.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">Potted flowering plants such as

plants were worth $496 million.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">A growing segment of the greenhouse
industry involves the production of vegetables under glass; the
value of vegetables grown in greenhouses more than doubled from
$91 million in 1992 to $200 million in 1996.  In the late 1980s,
tomatoes accounted for about 40 percent of greenhouse vegetables,
followed by cucumbers, 30 percent and lettuce, 13 percent.<BR>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">Every year, growers are assessed
about $700 million to support research and promotion of commodities
that range from milk to grapes.  Many farmers are beginning to
challenge these mandatory assessments and, in June 1996, the US
Supreme Court agreed to review a 1995 decision of the 9th US Circuit
Court of Appeals in San Francisco that declared unconstitutional
mandatory grower assessments of about $0.20 per 20 pound carton
of fresh fruit to generate $10 to $20 million per year to support
generic advertising of peaches, plums and nectarines (&quot;summer
fruits&quot;).</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">The case began in April 1987,
when several California packers petitioned USDA to stop collecting
the mandatory assessments, which total about $1 billion from all
kinds of farmers and support research and promotion for commodities
from California avocados to Vidalia onions.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">The 9th Circuit decision held
that USDA can compel growers to pay mandatory assessments if the
government can prove that there is a government interest in increasing
the consumption of the commodity being promoted, that generic
advertising increases consumption, and that there is minimal infringement
of grower rights.  The court said that the burden of proof is
on the commodity boards to prove that their advertising is useful
to growers.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">The California grower-packers
who brought the suit argued that they want to spend their promotion
moneys advertising their own brand, not peaches in general.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">In October 1996, Delano Farms,
a major California table grape grower that shipped 1.7 million
boxes of grapes in 1996, sued the California Table Grape Commission,
charging that mandatory assessments that raise $12.5 million each
year to promote grapes are an unconstitutional infringement on
 promotions.<BR>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">In calendar year 1995, 934,000
reporting units paid $309 billion in wages to an average 10.2
million employees.  Employers pay UI taxes on the first $7,000
of annual wages for an employee, so taxable wages of $83 billion
are only 27 percent of total wages paid in 1995.  Unemployed workers
received $3 billion in UI benefits in 1995.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">Some of the most interesting data
are those for individual industries.  The 38,000 agricultural
reporting units paid $6.8 billion to an average 464,000 covered
employees, or an average $14,700.  Agricultural employers contributed
$164 million in UI taxes, but unemployed workers received almost
twice as much in UI benefits, $304 million.</FONT></TT>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">The report provides data by two,
three, and selected four-digit SIC codes.  The 17,600 crop reporting
units paid $3 billion in total wages to an average 197,0000 covered
employees, and unemployed crop workers drew $156 million, twice
crop employer contributions of $78 million.</FONT></TT>

<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">This seven chapter book is the
story of Baldemar Velasquez and the Farm Labor Organizing Committee,
a union based in Toledo, Ohio that represented about 4,000 seasonal
farm workers employed on 100 Ohio and Michigan farms in 1991.
 The authors are ex-FLOC organizers who stress how FLOC developed
its winning strategy:  enlist churches, unions and other groups
to boycott food companies Campbells and Heinz.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">In 1994-95, FLOC reported that
it represented 90 percent of the workers in the pickling cucumber
industry in Ohio.  However, they report that there are 60,000
migrant workers in Ohio, Indiana, and Michigan, which would suggest
that FLOC represents fewer than 10 percent of area migrants.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">Campbells and Heinz bought tomatoes
and cucumbers from farmers, and FLOC was able to persuade Campbells
in 1986-87, and Heinz in 1987, to sign three-way agreements between
themselves, the growers who actually employed FLOC farm workers
and FLOC.  A chronology of FLOC activities is provided on pages
52-53 of the book.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">The strength of the book is its
insider's account of how FLOC persevered in its struggle for recognition
by the nonfarm food companies that had the ability to pay the
higher wages that FLOC wanted.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">The book is much less clear about
the desirability and usefulness of the FLOC method of using guilt
about poor farm workers to pressure food companies to improve
their wages.  In the FLOC case, Ohio and Michigan production is
a very small part of the total amount of cucumbers and tomatoes
each company buys; would the same strategy have worked in California,
where most of these commodities are produced?</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">FLOC endorsed a merger with the
UFW in 1985, but in July 1994, became a local union directly affiliated
with the AFL-CIO.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">The book does not deal with FLOC's
adaptation to the end of sharecropping in 1993.  Until 1993, many
FLOC members were share croppers who received as payment for picking
cucumbers 50 percent of the revenues they fetched when the cucumbers
were delivered to the processor.  As share croppers, they could
legally employ their children during the six to eight week harvest,
enabling a family to sometimes earn $1,000 or more weekly.</FONT></TT>

of Toil: A Migrant Family's Journey.  Pullman, Washington: Washington
State University.  </FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">This book is a newspaper reporter's
account of one year with a migrant worker family, 1991-92, based
in south Texas that every year follows the ripening crops to Washington
and Oregon.  The year-in-the-life project was sponsored by the
Walla Walla Union-Bulletin--according to one estimate, there were
7,500 migrant workers in Walla Walla county in the early 1990s.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">The first thing to note is that
the Martinez family is very unusual.  Due to a shortage of inexpensive
housing for short term migrants, there are few follow-the-crop
migrant workers, except in the northern states where workers are
needed for less than three months.  Patriarch Raul was also unusual
because he was 61 in 1991-92, far older than the typical migrant
worker--the book repeats the canard on page 57 that the average
life expectancy of a migrant farm worker is 48.  </FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">Finally, few extended families
make the migrant trek in the 1990s; the typical migrant farm worker
is a 25- to 35- year old man who shuttles into the US from Mexico,
and then works in a crew of 20 to 30 men which has jobs, and often
housing and transportation, arranged for them by an intermediary
such as a farm labor contractor.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">The Martinez family had 13 children.
 The family is also unusual in its ability to tap virtually every
program sponsored by the state and federal governments to assist
migrant and seasonal farm workers.  From Migrant Education to
Migration Health to Migrant Head Start to the job training program
that provides a summer job to the 15-year old son as a recreational
aide, the family seems to be familiar with many of the 15 federal
programs that assist farm workers at an annual cost of over $600
million.  </FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">Summaries of these programs are
presented in various chapters, but there is no sense of evaluation.
 For example, many of the children in the lower Rio Grande Valley
are enrolled in Migrant Education programs, but Fields of Toil
gives little sense of whether these supplemental federal funds
are being spent wisely.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">The strength of Fields of Toil
is its portrayal of manual labor for a country in which most people
provide services from office settings.  Most of the 18 chapters
are short, as befits the newspaper columns as they originally
appeared.  The family goes from crises to crisis, looking for
work where there are already too many workers, dealing with good
and bad employers, and always worrying that something may push
them further into poverty.</FONT></TT>

This monograph explains who moves, why people cross national borders,
and how migration flows are likely to evolve in the decades ahead.
 We then look at international migration through two prisms: 
first by region, examining, in turn, migration issues in North
America, Europe, and Asia, and then by type of migrant--refugees
and asylum seekers, guest workers, and illegal aliens.
<P>
Instead of building ever-higher walls to keep migrants out, many
rich countries would like to stop immigration by accelerating
economic growth and reducing wars and human rights violations
so that people would not want to cross national borders.  We explore
the migration-reducing potential of trade, aid and intervention
policies, and ask whether industrial nations can and should coordinate
their immigration and assistance policies.

Migration Challenge</A></H1>

<P>
Migration is the movement of people from one place to another.
 Migration is as old as humankind wandering in search of food,
but international migration is a relatively recent development--it
was only in the 20th century that the system of nation-states,
passports, and visas developed to regulate the flow of people
across borders. 
<P>
Today, there are 185 members of the United Nations, and each has
a system of passports to distinguish citizens and foreigners,
border controls, and policies toward the immigration and integration
of foreigners.  Most migration policies discourage immigration--most
countries do not anticipate the arrival of foreigners who wish
to settle and become naturalized citizens.  Many nations also
discourage emigration--the Communist nations until 1989 did their
best to prevent citizens from leaving the former USSR, East Germany,
and Romania.
<P>
Migration is a result of differences --differences in resources
and jobs, in demographic growth, and in security and human rights.
 These differences are widening, thus increasing potential migration.
 For example, according to World Bank calculations, the gap between
average incomes in the richest and poorest countries was about
11 to 1 in 1870, 38 to 1 in 1960, and 52 to 1 in 1985 (World Bank,
1995, 9), but today there is no country that will accept practically
all migrants who arrive, as North and South America did a century
ago.
<P>
Given these large and growing differences, how many people migrate
across borders?  The best estimates are that there are about 125
million persons living outside their country of citizenship, meaning
that about two percent of the world's population are legal or
illegal immigrants, refugees and asylum seekers, or migrant workers.
<P>
This nation of migrants was estimated to be about 100 million
strong in the late 1980s.  It rose by 25 percent in the 1990s
both because people moved across borders--migration--and because
borders moved across people, as occurred when the Soviet Union
broke up, and Russians found themselves in a &quot;foreign country,&quot;
even though they did not move.  It is important to remember that
some individuals become &quot;foreigners&quot; even though they
do not move. 
<P>
There are several ways to think about this &quot;nation of migrants.&quot;
 First, the nation of migrants is equivalent in size to the world's
eighth most populous nation, Japan, and is growing faster than
world population growth..  In several Middle Eastern nations,
foreigners are over half of the population or labor force, and
many nations formed from the ex-USSR have more than 25 percent
non-nationals.  Some countries, including Canada, Switzerland,
and Australia, have 15 to 25 percent foreign-born persons in their
populations. 
<P>
Second, many of the world's migrants are moving from relatively
fast-growing and therefore &quot;young&quot; developing nations
to aging societies that may resist the changes that accompany
immigration.   A society's &quot;demographic need&quot; for immigrants
may be the opposite of its willingness to accept them.
<P>
Third, there is no &quot;natural&quot; end in sight to the current
wave of migrants.  Uneven population growth, economic disparities,
and war and persecution are likely to continue to produce migrants
and refugees for the foreseeable future, and most observers believe
that the number of opportunity- and refugee-seeking migrants will
increase rather than decrease in the 21st century.  Paul Kennedy,
the Yale historian, flatly predicts that &quot;enhanced efforts
to control immigration... are unlikely to succeed...(Kennedy,
1993, 45).
<P>
On the other hand, those who emphasize that migration is a manageable
challenge for the industrial democracies begin with the observation
that the world's &quot;nation of migrants&quot; involves two percent,
not 20 percent, of the world's population, <I>despite </I>demographic,
economic, and other differences that might be expected to produce
a world on the move.  In other words, most people stay in their
country of birth, despite more borders to cross, and more incentives
to cross them.  
<P>
For example, the world's major country of emigration, Mexico,
has about 100 million people currently alive born within its borders,
and over 90 percent of them still live in their country of birth
despite massive legal and illegal Mexican migration to the United
States.  The world's second leading country of emigration, the
Philippines, includes over 90 percent of the 70 million persons
born within its borders.
<P>
Furthermore, countries can implement policies that control immigration.
 Germany's 1993 asylum reforms were apparently able to reduce
by two-thirds the number of asylum applicants in that country
without offsetting increases in illegal immigration.
<P>
But there is uncertainty and skepticism about the long-term effectiveness
of such control measures as the differences that motivate migration
widen.  The US, for example, thought in the late 1980s that illegal
immigration was under control, and that the economic boom that
was creating millions of jobs would persist, so the US increased
the number of immigration slots both to unify families and to
fill vacant jobs.  These assumptions have proven false, prompting
another round of immigration reforms in 1995 aimed at reducing
legal and illegal immigration.
<P>
The migration challenge in the world&#146;s immigration nations
has two faces, one external and one internal.  The external challenge
is how to deal with the millions of people who would like to immigrate
to take advantage of the opportunities offered for economic betterment
and political freedom.  The internal or integration challenge
is how to help immigrants and their children who are living in
immigration countries to be accepted as fellow citizens and future
leaders.

INTRODUCTION
<P>
The United States is engaged in a historic experiment:  more foreigners
are arriving to settle than ever before&#151;about 3,000 per day--and
the world's major country of immigration is unsure about how to
respond.  There are two extreme positions.  Organizations such
as Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) argue that
too many people are coming in, and they call for a moratorium
on immigration to allow recent arrivals and Americans to adjust
to each other.  At the other extreme, the Wall Street Journal
advocates a constitutional amendment that would state that &quot;there
shall be  open borders.&quot;  Immigration promises to be a major
demographic, economic, and political issue in the United States
at the end of the 20th century, as it was at its beginning.
<P>
This is not the first time that the world's &quot;huddled masses&quot;
have arrived on American shores, nor is it the first time that
there has been a controversy about whether to pull up the gangplank
or to open the immigration door wider.  Americans have always
been of two minds about immigration.  On the one hand, the United
States is proud to be a &quot;nation of immigrants&quot;, celebrating
the theme of national renewal and rebirth embodied in the story
of newcomers starting over in the land of opportunity.  On the
other hand, Americans have worried since the days of the founding
fathers about the economic, political, and cultural effects of
newcomers.  These concerns have been reflected in legislation
that limits the annual entry of immigrants, and by a preference
for those who have relatives here or possess needed skills.
<P>
The debate between restrictionists&#151;who want to reduce immigration&#151;and
admissionists&#151;who want to maintain or increase current immigration
flows&#151;promises to heat up in the 1990s for three reasons.
 First, the number of immigrants is rising. Immigration has once
again become a major contributor to population growth:  about
40 percent of U.S. population growth is now due to the immigration
of about a million newcomers per year; they represent the equivalent
of adding a Dallas or Detroit annually.
<P>
Second, today's immigrants are differ from  the American citizenry
in their ethnic origins and in their education and skills.  While
earlier waves of immigrants were mostly Europeans, today&#146;s
immigrants are primarily from Latin American and Asian countries.
 Most people of the United States (and most other industrial countries)
are  in the middle class, resulting in a diamond-shaped pattern
of skills and incomes.  Today's immigrants, by contrast, tend
to be  bunched near the extremes of the education and income spectrum:
whether professionals <I>or</I>  unskilled workers, they tend
to reinforce other factors promoting economic inequality.
<P>
Third, there is no consensus among politicians, researchers, or
Americans on whether the immigrants arriving today will be social
and economic assets or liabilities tomorrow.  The tendency of
immigrants who arrived in the 1950s and 1960s to earn more than
similar Americans within two decades, and the remarkable success
of some immigrants in business and education, can be read to suggest
that the nation will reap a windfall from today's immigration,
while other income, employment, and public assistance data can
be interpreted to suggest that through immigration the United
States may be adding directly and indirectly to its underclass.

<P>
Economic issues are not the only area in which the effects of
immigrants are disputed.  Should immigrants be allowed to vote
before they become U.S. citizens?  Does immigration result in
a melting pot amalgam of American and immigrant values, or is
America a salad bowl in which ethnic identity is be maintained?
 Many immigrants do not speak English.  Are they learning the
common language fast enough?
<P>
Immigration raises three fundamental questions:  how many, from
where, and in what status should newcomers be admitted to the
United States?  Until after World War I, the United States took
in almost all the immigrants who could get to American shores.
 It remains the nation most open to immigrants--accepting about
half of the world&#146;s immigrants--but immigration is now restricted
through a complex system that favors foreigners who have relatives
here or special skills.  
<P>
This monograph explains U.S. immigration patterns and policies.
 After summarizing trends in the 1980s, we turn to explanations
for why people migrate, and outline what can be done to reduce
migratory pressures.  The four waves of immigrants that comprise
U.S. immigration history are reviewed, as are U.S. legislative
responses to immigrant numbers and characteristics.  Immigration
raises both economic and socio-political issues, and some of the
major ones debated today are examined.  We then turn to other
countries:  why are immigrants streaming into Western Europe?
 Will Japan and other Asian nations also become destinations for
immigrants?  
<P>
 Immigration promises to be one of the most important issues for
the United Sates as the 21st Century approaches.  Newcomers raise
difficult questions.  Who are we?  What kind of a society have
we built, and whom shall we welcome to it?  What should we do
to integrate newcomers and how should we deal with those who arrive
uninvited?

The purpose of Migration Dialogue is to promote among opinion
leaders an off-the-record discussion of the major immigration
and integration issues likely to face the industrial democracies.
Three-day seminars are held in places that allow participants
during field trips to discuss with immigrants, service providers,
and others the day-to-day issues involved in dealing with immigration
and integration.

<B>9:00-9:45 AM Immigration and Integration: An Overview</B>
<P>
<B>Moderator</B>: Philip Martin, University of California-Davis

<B>Speaker</B>: Susan Martin, Commission on Immigration Reform
and
<P>
Roger B&ouml;hning, International Labor Office, Geneva<BR>

<P>
<U>Discussion questions</U>: When two distinct groups share a
geographic area, two extremes delineate their possible interaction--integration
or assimilation (eliminating boundaries between groups, encouraging
convergence in language, values, earnings etc.) and pluralism
or multiculturalism (encouraging maintenance of cultural diversity,
tolerating or welcoming enclaves). These are sometimes referred
to as the &quot;melting pot&quot; versus the &quot;salad bowl&quot;
approaches to accommodating immigrants.<BR>

<P>
1. What relationships can be identified between the patterns of
immigration and the integration experiences of immigrants? For
example, how do the numbers and origins of immigrants affect their
integration experiences? Does it matter for integration if immigration
flows from the same countries are continuous vs. fluctuating?

<P>
2. In countries of immigration such as the United States, and
in cities such as Chicago, what were the major factors that contributed
to the successful integration of large numbers of immigrants:
economic growth; policies favoring integration; and/or institutions
such as public schools, churches, unions, political parties, and
the military? What was the Americanization movement, what impacts
did it have on integration, and why is it criticized by some today?

<P>
3. How do the integration policies of European countries, and
of Canada and Australia, differ from those of the United States?

<P>
4. Are there trade-offs between immigration and integration policy?
For example, if a high proportion of immigrants enter under nuclear
or extended-family unification criteria, does this contribute
to or limit successful integration? Does it matter for integration
if immigrants are co-ethnics relocating to the &quot;mother country&quot;;
intending temporary vs. permanent immigrants; culturally/linguistically/racially/religiously
distinct from the receiving country's population? Is it easier
to successfully integrate a large immigrant population from the
same national/ethnic origin, or do diverse origins accelerate
integration? 
<P>
5. For purposes of integration, how important are underlying conditions
such as the labor market; the housing market; residential segregation
vs. dispersion; effectiveness of public education systems; etc.?

<P>
<U>Discussion questions</U>: The focus in this session is on native
reactions to immigrants. How do the perceptions of natives about
the ability of their societies to integrate the newcomers affect
their support for their society's immigration policies? An underlying
question is whether anti-immigrant reactions are cyclical reflections
of economic or political insecurity, or whether they are structural
reflections of demographic and other trends.
<P>
1. What is the history of Hispanic immigration to Chicago? What
are recent Hispanic immigration trends? What has been the recent
history of their economic and social integration and upward mobility?
<P>
2. How do current residents determine what constitutes the successful
integration of immigrants? What kind of integration indicators
do they look to: economic? language? crime? political activities?
immigrant children? intermarriage? What tend to be the flashpoints
that set off anti-immigrant native reactions? language? religion?
race? ethnic militancy?
<P>
3. How does the geographic concentration and linguistic segregation
of immigrants affect integration? What roles are played by the
nature of political and party systems?
<P>
4. What is the tenor of relations between recent Hispanic immigrants
and other ethnic groups in Chicago? How do Mexican immigrants
relate to Puerto Ricans?<BR>

<P>
1. How effective, both during the first half of the century and
more recently, have the public schools been as integrating institutions?
Similarly, what have been the historical and contemporary roles
of institutions such as churches, settlement houses, ethnic associations,
development banks, local political leaderships, etc.?
<P>
2. What is the current tone of relations among the diverse ethnic
groups of Chicago? Cordial and cooperative? Competitive but proper?
Hostile and suspicious?
<P>
3. To what extent do ethnic and racial issues drive local politics
in Chicago? What is the role of citizenship and naturalization
rules in integration? Would adoption of jus soli and easing naturalization
rules promote integration? What are the effects on integration
of recent changes in citizenship laws in France and Germany? Should
an in-between legal status be developed, such as &quot;denizen,&quot;
for settled immigrants who choose not to naturalize?
<P>
4. What effective efforts have been undertaken to minimize discrimination?
To minimize residential segregation of ethnic groups? To manage
conflicts that may arise? What types of organizations have been
most effective in such conflict management? <BR>

<A NAME="_Toc355670174">INTRODUCTION</A>
<P>
The fourth Migration Dialogue was held April 25-28, 1996 in Chicago.
Migration Dialogue seminars provide an opportunity for some 40
opinion leaders from France, Germany, and the US to discuss intensively,
in an off-the-record setting, the major immigration and integration
issues facing the industrial democracies. Each seminar includes
field trips, so that participants can learn about these issues
directly from immigrants and from immigration and integration
authorities.<BR>

<P>
This report was prepared after the seminar, and is being distributed
to participants in the Chicago seminar and to other interested
parties. Since it has not been seen or approved by participants,
it should not be construed as a consensus document discussed and
debated by participants. An agenda and list of participants are
attached.
<H1><A NAME="_Toc355670175">The Questions</A> </H1>

<P>
Four types of questions framed the Chicago discussions. First,
how did diverse immigrants come to be integrated in the US in
the past, and what are the lessons of history for integrating
the current wave of immigrants? In Europe, how can countries be
grouped in terms of their policies to integrate immigrants, and
why does there seem to be a sense that individual country experiences
show that there are &quot;many ways to fail&quot; when it comes
to integrating immigrants?<BR>

<P>
Second, why, by most criteria, do Hispanic immigrants seem to
fare worse than Asian immigrants arriving in the US today, but
better than US-citizen African Americans and Puerto Ricans? Are
there similar country-of-origin and ethnic differences in the
economic integration patterns of newcomers in Europe?<BR>

<P>
Third, what mechanisms brought about the integration of third-wave
European immigrants to the United States early in the 20th century?
Why do the integrating institutions--schools, unions, military,
churches etc.--seem to be less successful in integrating newcomers
today? Should they be revived and reformed, or do new immigrants
and new circumstances call for different integrating institutions
and policies? Given shrinking central government revenues, where
can the funds for efforts to integrate 21st century immigrants
be found? <BR>

<P>
Fourth, about one in eight Americans is African American, including
about 40 percent of Chicago's 2.7 million residents. African-Americans,
especially those in the central cities, have high rates of joblessness
and poverty. Some argue that African-Americans have been the US
residents most negatively affected by immigration, while others
believe that there is little relationship between the socio-economic
problems of African-Americans and recent immigration patterns.
<H1><A NAME="_Toc355670176">Immigration and Integration </A>Policies
</H1>

<P>
<B>Immigration policies</B> refer to questions such as--how many
immigrants should be admitted? From where? In what categories
or through which doors should immigrants enter--what is the proper
balance between immigrants admitted for family, economic, and
humanitarian reasons? In most countries, immigration policies
are exclusively the authority of the central government.<BR>

<P>
<B>Integration or immigrant policies</B> refer to public efforts
to deal with immigrants after their arrival, and they are set
by a mix of federal, state, and local policies. In the US, most
immigrants are &quot;sponsored&quot; by their US relatives or
US employers, and families and employers are expected to accommodate
them without public intervention or assistance. <BR>

<P>
Sponsorship is so powerful an integrating mechanism that the Commission
on Immigration Reform recommended that the US maintain the sponsorship
system rather than switching to a point system for admitting immigrants.
<BR>

<P>
Federal immigrant policies (1) are targeted on certain limited
groups, especially refugees, (2) regulate the access of newcomers
to general services provided by federal and state governments,
and (3) are determined in part by courts interpreting the rights
of immigrants based on their physical presence in the US. The
US has a relatively limited welfare state, and provides few targeted
services for immigrants who are not refugees. Most recent reform
efforts would further restrict the access of immigrants to government
services.<BR>

<P>
European countries offer more government services, and often provide
special services for immigrants, including, in some cases, public
support for maintaining the languages and cultures of newcomers.
However, it appears that, regardless of the policy mix adopted
in Europe, foreigners have unemployment rates about twice native
rates--similar to the 2 to 1 ratio of Black to white unemployment
in the US--and there have been clashes in many European countries
in which natives have attacked foreigners.
<H2><A NAME="_Toc355670177">Data</A> </H2>

<P>
Several speakers emphasized that immigration to the US is increasing
in number--roughly one million arrivals per year, 70 percent are
legally admitted. The immigrants are bimodal in origin and characteristics.
On the one hand, about 40 percent of US immigrants are from Latin
America, speak primarily Spanish, and have for the most part,
less education than the average US-born adult. On the other hand,
an equal proportion are from Asian countries, speak Chinese and
other Asian languages, and many have more education than US-born
adults.<BR>

<P>
Immigrants in the US are concentrated in certain neighborhoods
of six cities in six states. This concentration magnifies the
effects of immigration in those locations, with the consequence
that scholarly and popular attention is directed there. About
eight percent of the US population is foreign-born, but 95 percent
of all US residents live in places that have less than eight percent
foreign-born residents --Dade County, Florida has the highest
percentage of foreign-born residents--45 percent in 1990.<BR>

<P>
Studies of the economic effects of immigrants on US workers were
optimistic in the 1980s, in the sense that they found few negative
effects of immigrants on the wages or unemployment rates of similar
US workers, including African Americans. Studies in the 1990s
reach the opposite conclusion--immigration has a significant negative
effect on unskilled US workers, depressing their wages, and causing
US workers who compete with immigrants to leave areas with concentrations
of immigrants, or to seek jobs where there is little immigrant
competition, as in the public sector.<BR>

<P>
Until the 1980s, immigrants roughly replicated the US-born population
in the single-best predictor of earnings--years of education.
Immigrants arriving since the 1980s, however, have a different
distribution of years of schooling. When arrayed by years of education,
they are concentrated at the extremes of the distribution, so
that immigration joins globalization and technological change
as a factor that is squeezing people out of the middle class--pushing
them up or down the job ladder--and increasing competition at
the bottom of the labor market.
<H2><A NAME="_Toc355670178">Integration: Definitions</A> and Experience
</H2>

<P>
When two or more distinct groups share a geographic area, two
extremes delineate their possible interaction--<B>integration
or assimilation</B> means blurring or diminishing boundaries between
groups, encouraging convergence in language, values, earnings
etc. <B>Pluralism or multiculturalism</B>, on the other hand,
means encouraging the maintenance of cultural diversity, and tolerating
or welcoming ethnic enclaves. These are sometimes referred to
as the melting pot versus the salad bowl approaches to integrating
immigrants.<BR>

<P>
Since definitions of social issues usually contain at least the
seeds of proposed solutions, the definition of integration is
crucial for understanding the degree of integration of particular
immigrant groups. It was noted that Germany tends to define integration
in terms of lineage--persons descended from ethnic Germans in
the ex-USSR are more &quot;integrated&quot; in the sense that
they are automatically made citizens while Turks are by definition
less &quot;integrated,&quot; since they must acquire qualifications
in order to attain citizenship. <BR>

<P>
France, on the other hand, measures integration chiefly as an
ability to speak French. Foreigners who speak French will have
overcome a major hurdle to be considered French nationals. <BR>

<P>
The criterion of full integration in the US is citizenship, and
the US has the easiest path to citizenship of the major countries
of immigration--birth in the country, or five years of legal residence
and rudimentary knowledge of the English language and American
history and government. <BR>

<P>
One of the major questions in integration policy is whether there
is a trade-off between the number and the characteristics of immigrants
and the ease of integrating them. Thus, do countries tend to take
more immigrants if the immigrants are mostly professionals who
tend to earn high incomes and contribute tax dollars immediately?
Do efforts that make integration more difficult--such as Proposition
187's bar to services for unauthorized immigrants--help to control
the influx of such immigrants?
<H2><A NAME="_Toc355670179">US Integration Policy</A> </H2>

<P>
The United States has been shaped by immigration, and American
culture is the result of an amalgamation of many cultures. From
the starts, residents of the US have worried about whether every
group of newcomers to arrive could be successfully integrated
into American society. Benjamin Franklin lamented that the Germans
arriving in Pennsylvania in the 1750s would not become English
and would impose their language on the English. The German settlers
did, however, become Americans, and English remained the dominant
language. <BR>

<P>
Because America has been in constant flux throughout its history,
it was suggested that the kaleidoscope, the metaphor first used
by the historian John Higham to describe the reconfiguration of
American society as it added new elements, was more descriptive
than the more static metaphors of the melting pot or the salad
bowl. <BR>

<P>
Americans tend to think of the immigrants of long ago as good,
and the immigrants of the present day as bad, leading to the aphorism
that one can tell that newcomers are integrated into the US when
they want to stop immigration. Immigrants have long been associated
with good things--new blood and entrepreneurial dynamism, revitalization
of neighborhoods, and scientific breakthroughs--as well as with
disagreeable developments such as crime and disease, unemployment
and welfare usage, and fears of disloyalty and cultural change.
<BR>

<P>
American history suggests that the crucial variables affecting
immigrant integration are the number of immigrants, their characteristics--including
whether they concentrate in particular cities/areas--and socio-economic
&quot;receptivity&quot;--the state of the economy and the degree
of political confidence felt by residents. Government policies
aimed particularly at immigrants have had little to do with it.
In the history of the United States, integration, it was noted,
has been the result of unique constellations of historical circumstance
that cannot be made to repeat themselves. The past does not offer
models that can be adopted for use at a later time. 
<H3><A NAME="_Toc355670180">US Integration Instruments</A> </H3>

<P>
The US has a relatively limited welfare state that allocates benefits
to the &quot;deserving needy,&quot; such as the elderly, coupled
with an extensive set of court-determined individual rights. The
allocation of public benefits to groups which made their case
in Congress, and then using courts to expand access to benefits,
was born in the civil rights era of the 1960s, and came to be
expanded to include immigrants, who are mostly &quot;minorities&quot;
in US parlance. Affirmative action for blacks started as redress
for past wrongs. Benefits for newly arrived people from abroad
are justified as remedies for present-day discrimination. <BR>

<P>
US integration policy has been described as a system in which
individuals are assigned to groups, representatives of each group
negotiate with government for rights and privileges, and the resulting
social change facilitates the integration of diverse groups. 
<BR>

<P>
Many Migration Dialogue participants were of the view that there
is a contradiction between the US policy of admitting increased
numbers of poor and minority immigrants and the simultaneous attempt
to balance the budget by scaling back the welfare state and reducing
the access of immigrants to social services. This libertarian
thrust of US immigration policy would permit numbers to remain
high, and make naturalization the gateway to the reduced level
of benefits available.<BR>

<P>
The contrast with Germany is striking. Legal immigrants in Germany
have relatively full access to the more generous German welfare
state, and Germans discuss whether additional targeted programs
should be available to foreigners. <BR>

<P>
Governments on both sides of the Atlantic, however, are scaling
back public benefits, and deregulating their economies. Increasingly,
therefore, immigrants will have to fend for themselves in restructuring
economies and societies. <BR>

<P>
Early this century, immigrants finding their way in industrializing
America achieved substantial social and economic upward mobility.
Some achieved positions of power in unions and in politics that
they used to combat unemployment and monopoly business power.
Integration or Americanization was promoted by social workers,
settlement houses, and schools. For the largest immigrant group,
Germans, the pace of integration was forced by two world wars,
and the public use of the German language was stopped as a token
of loyalty to America. 
<H2><A NAME="_Toc355670181">European Integration Policies</A>
</H2>

<P>
Europeans tend to define immigrant integration differently than
do Americans--they perceive German or French language and culture
as more fixed than Americans view theirs --and to look to different
indicators of integration--unemployment rates, or the rate of
physical attacks on foreigners, for example. Most European countries
occupy the assimilation end of the integration spectrum--France
defines integration to include learning proper French and &quot;acting
French&quot; in public--with well-defined exceptions for historic
minorities. <BR>

<P>
None of the European countries has multicultural immigrant integration
policies designed specifically for &quot;different&quot; immigrants,
as in Australia and Canada.<BR>

<P>
American data tends to compare the progress of groups with reference
to indicators of integration. The groups are defined by race and
ethnicity. Europeans tend to look to compare foreigners and citizens.
<BR>

<P>
In the US, the major gaps are between races, including the 2 to
1 ratio of African Americans to white unemployment rates. In Europe,
there is about a 2 to 1 ratio of foreigner to citizen unemployment
rate, and it does not vary significantly from country to country.
<BR>

<P>
The US has often associated high rates of crime with immigrants.
In California, about 40,000 of the 140,000 persons in prison were
born abroad, including 20,000 who were believed to be illegal
aliens when they committed felonies. In Europe, by contrast, successful
integration was defined in terms of the absence, or infrequency,
of attacks by nationals on foreigners.<BR>

<P>
Germany has a famed school-to-work transition program that provides
two-thirds of the non-college bound high school graduates with
a certificated skill. This apprenticeship certificate normally
leads to a good job that can last a lifetime. However, foreign
youth, including those born in Germany, often do not participate
in the apprenticeship system, consigning themselves to lower wages
and more uncertainty.
<H2><A NAME="_Toc355670182">Unauthorized Migrants</A> </H2>

<P>
Integration policy normally refers to legal immigrants and refugees.
But many of the migrants in industrial democracies are in a &quot;gray
area&quot; in which they are either tolerated or continue in an
unauthorized status. How does the proportion of migrants who are
legally-invited immigrants and refugees affect integration policies?
<BR>

<P>
Germany and the Scandinavian countries believe that they can prevent
illegal immigration, so they make sharp distinctions between legal
and illegal migrants, with the result that some public employees
other than those directly concerned with immigration are involved
in immigration regulations. France and the US, on the other hand,
are more likely to accept their inability to eliminate illegal
immigration, leading to incomplete amnesties and the development
of schemes through which some rights are granted to illegal aliens
<H1><A NAME="_Toc355670183">Focus on </A>Illinois and Chicago
</H1>

<H2><A NAME="_Toc355670184">Illinois</A> </H2>

<P>
Illinois is the sixth most populous state, with almost 12 million
residents in 1996--75 percent white, and 8 percent foreign born.
Illinois is often described as two states--the Chicago area, with
about six million residents, including 80 percent of the state's
immigrants, and &quot;downstate,&quot; another six million residents
who are 90 percent US-born whites. <BR>

<P>
The state's population has been in the 11 to 12 million range
since 1970, a period during which the US population rose by 60
million, and the population of California increased by 12 million.
<BR>

<P>
Illinois has been losing US-born residents, and receiving about
45,000 legal immigrants each year, plus an estimated 15,000 unauthorized
immigrants. <BR>

<P>
There are about one million foreign-born persons in the state.
Eighty percent are in the Chicago area, making immigrants about
nine percent of Illinois' 12 million residents-- almost 20 percent
of Chicago's 2.7 million residents were born abroad.<BR>

<P>
Of the almost one million foreign-born persons in Illinois enumerated
in the 1990 Census, about 40 percent were from Mexico and Latin
America. One-third of the immigrants in Illinois were from Europe;
the largest single group was from Poland. One-fourth of the foreign-born
were from Asia, with the largest single group from Philippines.
<BR>

<P>
Seven of the top 15 immigrant countries of origin are European,
and 40 percent of Illinois's immigrants arrived since 1980. About
107,000 of Illinois's K-12 students are in some type of bilingual
program.<BR>

<P>
About two-thirds of the &quot;old&quot; European immigrants have
become naturalized US citizens, almost half of the Asian immigrants
are US citizens, and less than one-third of the Hispanic immigrants
are US citizens.
<H2><A NAME="_Toc355670185">Chicago</A> </H2>

<P>
Chicago, a city of 2.7 million on the southern shores of Lake
Michigan is about 40 percent African American, about 35 percent
white, about 20 percent Hispanic, and five percent Asian. About
one-third of the Hispanics were born abroad.<BR>

<P>
Chicago was for many years the second largest city in the US,
after New York City. Its growth was due to its role as the transportation
hub for the US, and a meat packing and manufacturing center--its
stockyards slaughtered one billion head of cattle and hogs, and
its factories included a Western Electric plant with 48,000 employees.
<BR>

<P>
Immigrants from Germany and Ireland, as well as southern and Eastern
Europe, who found manual jobs in factories and railyards, gave
Chicago a reputation as a city with &quot;broad shoulders&quot;
that &quot;worked&quot;--often under very hard conditions at low
wages. Each of these immigrant groups founded its own neighborhood
church, giving Chicago separate Catholic churches and schools
for e.g., Irish, Italian, German, Bohemian, and Croatian groups.
<BR>

<P>
Like other midwestern cities such as Cleveland and Detroit, Chicago
attracted African Americans--southern Blacks saw Chicago and other
midwestern cities as &quot;the promised land,&quot; and 50,000
migrated to Chicago between 1915 and 1920, and another 100,000
in the 1920s. Hundreds of thousands of small farmers and sharecroppers
migrated into Chicago, especially after 1945. <BR>

<P>
African Americans initially remained in the southern parts of
Chicago, near the terminus of the railroad that brought them to
Chicago. During the 1960s, there were numerous clashes between
Blacks and ethnic white immigrants as Blacks attempted to desegregate
housing by moving into ethnic Polish or Italian neighborhoods--repeating
what has been termed &quot;the chasing across the prairie&quot;
of various racial and ethnic groups.<BR>

<P>
Automobiles and freeways changed Chicago after World War II, as
the better off groups moved to the suburbs. The 1970s and 1980s
were marked by the economic decline of Chicago, white flight to
the suburbs, the entrance of Blacks into local city politics,
and the loss of factory jobs that paid high wages and could be
filled easily by newcomer immigrants. 
<H3><A NAME="_Toc355670186">Little Village</A> </H3>

<P>
The Little Village section of Chicago is one of two areas of heavy
Mexican immigrant settlement. This previously Czech immigrant
settlement is ringed by one-story factories that turn out a variety
of non-durable goods with relatively low-wage immigrant workers.
<BR>

<P>
Many of the settled Mexicans have begun small businesses to serve
the immigrants who continue to arrive--the 26th street shopping
district reportedly was second only to Michigan Avenue in shopping
dollars. However, there was some uncertainty about whether the
second generation schooled in the US would commit themselves to
taking over family businesses that often require very long hours
of work.<BR>

<P>
The factories employing mostly Mexican immigrants tend to recruit
workers by asking their current workers to refer family and friends
to fill vacant jobs. One factory processed the workers referred
by such family networks through a temporary employment agency,
so that all new workers were in effect probationary hires for
several weeks to several months. Once they were selected as permanent
employees, the employer offered them with pay at their regular
hourly rate for the time spent completing a GED high-school education.
<BR>

<P>
Another factory employed over 2,000 workers in a sprawling facility.
A condition of employment was that they work five or six 12-hour
days. At entry level, the first eight hours were compensated at
the minimum wage, with time and a half for the remaining four
hours. The long hours of work seemed to serve as an effective
screening device that favored newly-arrived Mexicans--many Americans
expect a 40-hour work week.<BR>

<P>
The schools in the 22nd ward of Chicago where Little Village is
located tend to be older two story structures jammed with students
born in Mexico. Many of the teachers do not live in the neighborhood.
Chicago has elected school boards, and school board elections,
in which unauthorized residents can run for office and vote, has
helped to launch several political careers.
<H3><A NAME="_Toc355670187">Polish Immigrants</A> </H3>

<P>
There are one million residents of Polish ancestry among the six
million persons in the Chicago metro area--two-thirds of them
live in the suburbs. An estimated 125,000 of them speak primarily
Polish, and 60,000 are believed to have arrived since 1990. <BR>

<P>
There were about 17,600 Polish applications for legalization in
1987-88, including 5,300 Polish SAW applications. Some 8,000 Poles
were legalized in the Chicago area in 1986-87. About 160,000 or
five percent of the three million applications for legalization
in 1987-88 were filed in Illinois.<BR>

<P>
There are several Polish language newspapers and radio stations,
reflecting both rising immigration and the fact that many immigrants
in the 1980s were dissident intellectuals.
<H3><A NAME="_Toc355670188">African Americans</A> </H3>

<P>
About 12 percent or 26 million Americans are African-American,
self-designated, since persons select their racial and ethnic
identity in the US for the census and other government agencies.
Blacks are about half of all US minority residents, and they are
generally those least likely to have achieved the American dream--the
success that is thought to be possible for anyone who works hard,
no matter how humble his/her station at birth. <BR>

<P>
Sentiments of African Americans are divided on immigration. Some
see minority immigrants as potential allies in the struggle to
obtain more benefits for minorities in the US; others see immigrants
as competitors for low-wage jobs that who retard African American
progress. Some whites argue that, if Asians and Caribbean Black
immigrants can fulfill the American dream, this demonstrates lingering
poverty is the fault of the individual, and not the US economic
system.<BR>

<P>
It was explained that comparisons of various immigrant groups
with US born Blacks are often misleading, because the Blacks in
the data include all American Blacks, whereas the immigrants are
often selected, or self-selected, from their home population because
they are likely to succeed in the US. Korean or Caribbean Black
immigrants, for example, are often drawn from the middle and upper
ends of the education and motivation spectrums of their societies,
and can be expected to do better in the US than the average Black.
<BR>

<P>
Similarly, most US-born Blacks were educated in urban areas of
the US and are thus familiar with the history of discrimination
against generations of US African Americans. They are far more
skeptical about the value of hard work for low wages than recent
immigrants from rural Mexico.<BR>

<P>
The indicators of integration for US-born Blacks put them near
the bottom of the US job ladder. But the same is also true for
many immigrant groups are also near the bottom, including Hmong
refugees and Dominican immigrants. If these groups fail to succeed
in the next generation or two, then the notion that the American
dream still works may be called into question by middle-class
Hispanics and Asians.<BR>

<P>
As immigration has increased in the 1980s and 1990s, evidence
has mounted that, as economic theory and common sense would suggest,
immigrants depress the wages and increase Black joblessness. In
1980 in Chicago, for example, there were two Blacks for every
Hispanic employed in construction. By 1990, Hispanics outnumbered
Blacks in the Chicago construction industry.<BR>

<P>
There are tensions between minority immigrants in Chicago. For
example, the public housing system is primarily Black--Hispanics
are about 20 percent of Chicago's population, but they are only
two percent of the tenants in the city's public housing units.
Even Lawndale Gardens, public housing in the heart of Little Village,
has only five percent Hispanic tenants.<BR>

<P>
Despite severe problems in the public housing system, there is
a long waiting list of persons wanting to get into public housing,
and the Chicago Housing Authority stopped taking applications
in 1985--persons moving in to subsidized units in 1996 applied
in 1981. Residents in public housing pay 30 percent of their income
for rent, and the government makes up the difference.<BR>

<P>
Hispanics sued the CHA in 1994, arguing that many Hispanics were
dropped off the waiting list because they did not respond to requests
for updated information that was available only in English.
<H2><A NAME="_Toc355670189">Chicago--Similarities and Differences</A>
</H2>

<P>
Immigration into Chicago is in some respects similar to immigration
elsewhere. First, immigration is accelerating ethnic shifts, making
minorities taken together sum to a majority, first in the central
city, and later in the region as a whole.<BR>

<P>
Second, the integration of European immigrants in Chicago served
as the basis for the three-generation language-shift integration
theory--the first generation did not learn English, the second
was bilingual, and the third was monolingual English. The University
of Chicago was the base of the leading theorists of immigrant
integration for much of the 20th century.<BR>

<P>
Third, as in other areas, immigration in Chicago brings promises
and problems. One the one hand, immigrants are credited with filling
vacant jobs, starting small businesses, and revitalizing neighborhoods.
On the other hand, the roughly 45,000 immigrants arriving in the
state each year, plus another 15,000 unauthorized immigrants,
are blamed for overburdening especially overcrowded school systems,
contributing to crime, and adding directly and indirectly to welfare
costs. <BR>

<P>
Chicago and Illinois are also different from other places in their
immigration and integration patterns. First, Chicago has a history
of successfully integrating diverse immigrants, and unlike other
cities, Chicago still has a relatively large number of manufacturing
jobs open to unskilled and semi-skilled immigrants. The political
climate in Chicago and Illinois seems to deter extremist reactions
to immigrants.<BR>

<P>
Second, Chicago&iacute;s immigrants are more diverse than is common
elsewhere. The three leading countries of origin for immigrants
in Chicago are Mexico, Poland, and the Philippines, making Chicago
the only major US city in which the three leading countries of
origin are on three different continents. There are also relatively
few refugees in Chicago, so that few newcomers go directly into
the welfare system.<BR>

<P>
Third, Chicago has long been associated with distinct immigrant
neighborhoods, the Irish in one neighborhood, the Polish in another,
and the Germans in a third, Lithuanians in a fourth, etc. Today's
immigrants are also concentrated in particular neighborhoods,
and they can utilize Chicago's peculiar brand of politics to achieve
some degree of political integration. Since the city has over
50 aldermen for just over 2.5 million residents, each local politician
represents just 50,000 residents, and residents turn to their
alder person to participate in social events such as weddings,
and to deal with city hall.<BR>

The purpose of Migration Dialogue is to promote among youngish
opinion leaders in an off-the-record setting a discussion of the
major immigration and integration issues likely to face the industrial
democracies over the coming decade. Three-day seminars are held
in places that allow participants during field trips to discuss
with immigrants, service providers, and others the day-to-day
issues involved in immigration and integration.

Chair, U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform, and Jonas Widgren,
Director of the <FONT COLOR=#000000>International Centre for Migration

<P>
Discussion questions: When two groups share a geographic area,
two extremes delineate their possible interaction--integration
or assimilation (eliminating boundaries between groups, encouraging
convergence in language, values, earnings etc.) and pluralism
or multiculturalism (encouraging maintenance of cultural diversity,
tolerating or welcoming enclaves). These are sometimes referred
to as the melting pot versus the salad bowl approaches to accommodating
immigrants.<BR>

<P>
1. What were the traditional modes of interaction in classic immigration
countries such as the US? What were the major factors that helped
immigrants to integrate successfully in the past--economic growth;
political leadership; integrating institutions such as churches,
schools, political parties, unions, and the military; the number
of immigrants; immigrant characteristics? How many of these successful
integration policies were planned as integration instruments,
and which ones were the result of general social policies and
goals? Why are the Americanization policies that successfully
integrated immigrants in the past decried by some today? How do
the integration policies of Canada and Australia differ from those
of the United States?<BR>

<P>
2. What factors guided integration policies in European countries?
How were integration policies and the perceptions of immigrant
integration affected by the reasons for the arrival of migrants?
For example, were there differences in integration policies and
experiences between &quot;immigrants&quot; from former colonies,
guestworkers, and ethnic minorities relocating to the &quot;mother
country?&quot; How have integration policies and attitudes changed
as migration flows become more diverse?<BR>

<P>
3. How do immigration policy instruments such as family unification,
efforts to prevent illegal immigration, and other policies designed
to manage the influx of newcomers affect integration patterns
today? Which seems most important in affecting prospects for successful
integration--the number of immigrants to be integrated, or their
&quot;differentness&quot; from the native population? <BR>

<P>
4. What are the trade-offs in integration policy? Is the major
trade-off that between numbers and integration success? Or is
it between &quot;differentness&quot; and integration success,
meaning that it is easier to integrate large numbers of similar
immigrants than small numbers of persons who are very different
in language, religion, or culture. 
<P>
To what extent are per country &quot;quotas&quot; or &quot;ceilings&quot;
useful in preserving multi-national and multi-ethnic flows of
immigrants that minimize separatism? Does continuous immigration
from the same country affect the integration patterns of those
already present?

<P>
The focus in this session is on native reactions to immigrants.
This session is designed to explore how the perceptions of natives
about the ability of their societies to integrate the newcomers
affects their support for their society's immigration policies.
An underlying question is whether anti-immigrant reactions are
cyclical reflections of economic or political insecurity, or whether
they are structural reflections of demographic and other trends.
<P>
1. How do current residents determine what constitutes the successful
integration of immigrants? What kind of integration indicators
do they look to: economic? language? crime? political activities?
immigrant children? intermarriage? <BR>

<P>
2. What tend to be the flashpoints that set off anti-immigrant
native reactions? language? religion? race? How relevant are low
fertility rates of natives in the immigration society, so that
a disproportionate share of babies are born to immigrants? How
does the geographic concentration of immigrants affect integration?
What roles are played by the nature of political and party systems?
<BR>

<P>
3. Does ethnic militancy generate a native backlash that inhibits
integration. For example, if Muslims insist that girls wear headscarves
to school, does the French reaction to Muslim religious strictures
inhibit their integration? Similarly, how does bilingual education
that encourages immigrant children to maintain their native language
affect native reactions and integration prospects?<BR>

<P>
4. How did worries over integration affect immigration policy
in the past? What are the effects of anti-immigrant political
movements on native reactions to the perception and reality of
immigrant integration?<BR>

<P>
Discussion questions: This session focuses on the immigrants,
and is designed to provide case studies of how well immigrants
are integrating as measured by various integration indicators.
An underlying question is how the success or failure to accommodate
immigrants affects immigration policy.<BR>

<P>
1. What do France, Germany, and the US do to integrate immigrants?
Do these policies vary by type of immigrant, immigrant needs (how
evaluated?), or economic and other conditions at the time in the
immigration or emigration country?<BR>

<P>
2. What are the most important indicators of immigrant integration--their
place in the labor market, earnings, education, prison and welfare
use, intermarriage, naturalization, etc.--and how do they vary
by type of immigrant (family, humanitarian, economic), country
of origin, and other immigrant characteristics? Is there such
a thing as &quot;segmented assimilation?&quot;
<P>
3. Has the creation of publicly-funded immigrant assistance programs
and organizations helped to steer immigrant integration in certain
directions--e.g. Cubans have tended to seek private sector opportunities
more than Southeast Asian refugees, whose leaders in many cases
provide government-funded social services to their communities?
<BR>

<P>
4. To what extent does and should our ability to predict who is
most likely to integrate successfully be used to make immigration
policy?<BR>

<P>
5. What is the role of citizenship and naturalization rules in
integration? Would adoption of jus soli and easing naturalization
rules promote integration? What are the effects on integration
of recent changes in citizenship laws in France and Germany? Should
an in-between legal status be developed, such as &quot;denizen,&quot;
for settled immigrants who choose not to naturalize?<BR>

This is the report of the third Migration Dialogue seminar, which
was held on September 15-18, 1995 in Paris. Migration Dialogue
seminars provide an opportunity for 35 to 40 opinion leaders to
discuss in an intensive and off-the-record setting the major immigration
and integration issues facing the industrial democracies. Each
seminar includes field trips, so that participants can learn about
these issues directly from immigrants and immigration and integration
authorities.<BR>

<P>
This report was prepared after the seminar, and is being distributed
to participants in the Paris seminar, as well as previous Migration
Dialogue seminars, and to other interested parties. It has not
been read or approved by participants, and should not be construed
as a consensus document discussed and debated by participants.
An agenda and list of participants are attached.<BR>

<P>
The major question discussed in Paris was sharply focused: do
fears that newcomers cannot integrate successfully prompt efforts
to reduce or stop immigration flows? One participant argued forcefully
that the answer is yes--the first step to deal with the integration
of foreigners and their children is, in this opinion, to stop
immigration. Only then could governments tackle the problems associated
with integration, which range from the isolation of immigrants
in housing and schools to federal-local tax and power issues.
<BR>

<P>
Other participants did not agree that it was necessary to stop
immigration in order to integrate newcomers. They emphasized that
many of the problems identified with integrating immigrants would
not necessarily be on the way to resolution if immigration simply
stopped.<BR>

<P>
On the field trips, participants discussed the process for issuing
residence permits to foreigners with immigration police, and accompanied
them on walks through Sentier and Barbes, two garment districts
filled with immigrant workers in Paris. Participants visited the
largest mosque in France, and heard from &igrave;official&icirc;
Muslim leaders that fundamentalists were only a small fraction
of the three to four million Muslims in France.<BR>

<P>
Participants visited Montfermeil, a sububan city outside Paris
with a population of 26,000 that is composed of about one-third
immigrants and their children. Immigrants there are concentrated
in a handful of 1960s-era six-story apartment blocks, and their
children attend schools that serve mostly immigrant children.
To promote integration, the French government has hired additional
social workers and added teachers, but has no plans to mix native-born
and immigrant children through active public housing or transportation
policies.<BR>

<P>
Because of security concerns arising from the recent bombings
in Paris, schools were deemed off limits to visitors. In place
of visiting a school with immigrant children, French teachers
came to the meeting to discuss issues involved in educating immigrant
children.
<H1><A NAME="_Toc337341655">Immigration Policies and Integration
Patterns</A> </H1>

<H2><A NAME="_Toc337341656">Will Immigration Continue?</A> </H2>

<P>
Will large scale immigration, and thus the need to integrate newcomers
in industrial democracies, continue in the 21st century? Migration
is a result of differences--especially differences in economic
opportunity and security--and these differences are widening,
increasing potential migration.<BR>

<P>
The number of people who would like to migrate is probably many
times the number who actually do, so that increased potential
migration does not necessarily result in a comparable increase
in migrants. But widening differences, and wars and other crises,
promise continued immigration despite recent efforts to reduce
immigration into France, Germany, and the US. Dealing with unwanted
immigration, it was emphasized, is likely to be a major challenge
in the 21st century. <BR>

<P>
Continuing unwanted immigration highlights the growing gap between
immigration policy goals and outcomes in industrial democracies.
In few other areas of public policy is the credibility of governments
so low. For example, French governments since 1974 have implied
that immigration has stopped, reducing the credibility of the
government when blue-collar workers observed immigrants moving
into their neighborhoods. This is one reason why, in several European
countries, political parties whose primary or major aim is to
reassert control over immigration have obtained 10 to 20 percent
of all votes.
<H2><A NAME="_Toc337341657">World Population and Migration</A>
</H2>

<P>
The world's population of about 5.7 billion in mid-1995 was distributed
among 185-odd countries. Each country has its own definition of
citizen and foreigner, which makes determining the number of migrants
difficult, but the best estimates are that there are about 125
million persons living outside their country of citizenship. About
two percent of the world's population are legal or illegal immigrants,
refugees and asylum seekers, or migrant workers.<BR>

<P>
There are two ways to look at this &quot;nation of migrants.&quot;
First, the nation of migrants is equivalent in size to the world's
eighth most populous nation, Japan, and is growing faster than
the world's population. Immigration is also contributing significantly
to population growth in industrial democracies--it accounts for
half or more of the population growth in countries such as the
US and Canada, and immigration prevents population declines in
low fertility nations such as Germany.<BR>

<P>
Second, many of the world's migrants are moving from relatively
fast-growing and therefore &quot;young&quot; developing nations
and toward aging societies. Aging and demographically stable societies
may resist the social changes that accompany immigration. This
means that a society's &quot;demographic need&quot; for immigrants
may be the opposite of its willingness to accept them. <BR>

<P>
Third, there is no &quot;natural&quot; end in sight to the current
wave of migrants. Population growth, economic disparities, and
war and persecution are likely to continue to produce migrants
and refugees for the foreseeable future, and most observers believe
that the number of opportunity- and refugee-seeking migrants will
increase rather than decrease in the 21st century.<BR>

<P>
On the other hand, those who believe that migration is a manageable
challenge for the industrial democracies begin with the observation
that the world's &quot;nation of migrants&quot; involves two percent,
not 20 percent, of the world's population, <I>despite </I>demographic,
economic, and other factors that might be expected to produce
a world on the move. In other words, most people stay in their
country of birth, despite more borders to cross, and more incentives
to cross them. <BR>

<P>
For example, one of the world's major countries of emigration,
Mexico, has 100 million people currently alive born within its
borders, and over 90 percent of them still live in their country
of birth. Over 90 percent of the 70 million persons born in the
Philippines live there.<BR>

<P>
Furthermore, countries can control immigration. Germany's 1993
asylum reforms, some argue, were able to reduce by two-thirds
the number of asylum applicants in that country without offsetting
increases in illegal immigration.<BR>

<P>
But there is uncertainty and skepticism about the long-term effectiveness
of immigration control measures. The US, for example, thought
in the late 1980s that illegal immigration was under control,
and that the economic boom would persist, so that the US increased
the number of immigration slots both to unify families and to
fill vacant jobs. These assumptions have proven false, prompting
another round of immigration reforms aimed at reducing legal and
illegal immigration.
<H2><A NAME="_Toc337341658">Definitions</A> and Questions </H2>

<P>
Before turning to integration issues in more detail, a few definitions
are in order. When two or more distinct groups share a geographic
area, two extremes delineate their possible interaction--<B>integration
or assimilation</B> means eliminating boundaries between groups,
encouraging convergence in language, values, earnings etc. <B>Pluralism
or multiculturalism</B>, on the other hand, means encouraging
the maintenance of cultural diversity, and tolerating or welcoming
ethnic enclaves. These are sometimes referred to as the melting
pot versus the salad bowl approaches to accommodating immigrants.
<BR>

<P>
The discussion found several points of agreement. First, settled
immigrants should be naturalized citizens, but there is a sharp
contrast between the US goal of encouraging naturalization, and
France and Germany offering a naturalization option, but not encouraging
naturalization. Many participants argued that Germany discourages
naturalization. <BR>

<P>
Second, integration is easiest to achieve with young children
in families that want to settle, which makes language and schools
key instruments to ensure that newcomers are integrated by the
second generation. Third, there is a relationship between immigration
and integration, in the sense that a continued influx of foreigners
may make immigrants less interested in integrating, and natives
less willing to make the adaptations required for integration
and may make the integration process in general more difficult.
<BR>

<P>
However, what was striking were the apparent differences in the
<B>concept</B> of integration. Blood (i.e. genetics) largely defines
who is German, the ability to speak French largely defines who
is French, and being born in the US, or learning some English
and civics, defines Americans.<BR>

<P>
The discussion centered on several issues. First, exactly what
are the trade-offs, if any, between continuing immigration and
integration? What are the appropriate parameters--the number of
immigrants, or how similar the newcomers are to current residents
in language and religion? By how much is integration eased by
an economic &quot;need&quot; for newcomers, or guilt over the
plight of refugees or ethnic members abroad?<BR>

<P>
Second, is integration eased by governments that are forthright
and clear in spelling out country priorities as to the annual
number of immigrants, their characteristics, and their distribution
by country of origin?<BR>

<P>
Third, to what extent is there a universal relationship between
numbers of immigrants and ease of integration? Are there &quot;waves&quot;
of immigrants precisely because large numbers of immigrants set
in motion forces that eventually reduce immigration?
<H2><A NAME="_Toc337341659">Integrating Quasi Immigrants</A> 
</H2>

<P>
Disagreement on exactly how to curb immigration as newcomers continue
to arrive has led to a proliferation of in-between immigration
statuses, such as Temporary Protected Status. These statuses permit
foreigners to remain legally in the country, and sometimes to
work, but they do not grant the secure status of residents who
are expected to settle that is assumed in most theories of how
societies integrated newcomers.<BR>

<P>
In the 1990s, for example, the US acquired its largest-ever number
of &quot;unwanted immigrants.&quot; Today, about two percent of
the US population--some four to five million persons--are unauthorized
or quasi-authorized aliens. <BR>

<P>
In other words, despite high levels of <I>legal</I> immigration,
as many as 50 percent more &igrave;unwanted&icirc; foreigners
are arriving in the US, and there are fears that the control systems
in place cannot prevent their entry, or enforce their departure.
<BR>

<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>Europe faces a similar situation. Even though
most European countries do not consider themselves countries of
immigration, in 1992 some three million &igrave;foreigners&icirc;
arrived in Western European nations. </FONT>
<P>
About half of Europe's newcomers arrived outside normal immigration
channels. Most European nations permit family unification for
citizens and resident aliens without quotas and waiting lists
but, in addition, some 700,000 foreigners applied for asylum in
1992; another 400,000 persons fleeing the Yugoslav war arrived
and were handled outside the asylum system; and an estimated 400,000
unauthorized aliens arrived.
<P>
Indeed, since European nations in the early 1990s launched individual
and collective efforts to reassert control over immigration, the
number of newcomers arriving each year has remained in the two
to three million range, but an ever larger share of all newcomers
are in illegal or quasi legal statuses.
<P>
Immigrants are arriving on both sides of the Atlantic through
front, side, and back doors. Front-door immigration includes family
unification, immigrants who arrive with permission to fill vacant
jobs, and refugee admissions--in most cases, these immigrants
are expected to settle and to become fellow citizens. Side-door
immigrants are foreigners in the country for a specific time and
purpose, such as tourists, students, or &quot;temporary&quot;
workers. As such, they are expected to leave the country, not
to integrate. Back-door immigrants are those who became residents
unlawfully and are to be deported rather than integrated.<BR>

<P>
There are many issues involved in integrating foreigners into
their new host societies, but three stand out. First, the number
of planned-for legal immigrants is at historic highs, and these
immigrants are often quite different from resident populations
in language, religion, and the ability to quickly earn as much
as the native born. <BR>

<P>
The fact that many newcomers have low incomes raises issues as
to how much governments should intervene and assist newcomers.
Canada and Australia have programs that provide assistance to
newcomers, the US provides such assistance mostly to refugees,
and Germany confines special language and welfare assistance mostly
to ethnic Germans who return to Germany and are immediately eligible
to become German citizens.<BR>

<P>
Second, immigration societies today differ from the classic immigration
countries at the turn of the century. There is less political
consensus that assimilation into the host society's language and
culture should occur as rapidly as possible, or even at all. Integrating
institutions such as churches, the military, labor unions, and
schools are smaller or less sure of their role in integrating
newcomers today than they were in the past. <BR>

<P>
As one participant noted, a society must have confidence in its
policies for integrating domestic minorities and poor persons
if it is to develop an integration policy for foreigners. Policies
that may be controversial in their own right, such as affirmative
action or busing, may be doubly controversial when available to
immigrants.<BR>

<P>
Third, integration is difficult when so many of the newcomers
are in unauthorized or quasi-authorized legal statuses. At the
turn of the century, immigrants to the US were presumed to want
to settle, and Americanization tried to speed up their integration.
<BR>

<P>
Today, countries do not have such simple either/or integration
policies. They may <I>want to</I> integrate some immigrants rapidly,
but encourage others, such as students and temporary workers,
to adhere to their plans to leave when their education or employment
is complete. But since all types of aliens may be in proximity
to each other--sometimes in the same family--it is very hard to
avoid contradictions between immigration control and integration
policies.
<H1><A NAME="_Toc337341660">Native Perceptions</A> </H1>

<P>
Most people in industrial democracies think that immigration should
be reduced. But most industrial democracies link immigration and
integration in Grand Bargains that, e.g., couple new controls
on illegal immigration with an amnesty or an easier path to naturalization.
In France, for example, late 1970s and early 1980s efforts to
deport Algerians, and then to pay workers with residence and employment
rights to depart, were followed by programs in 1984 that promoted
integration.<BR>

<P>
However, France also provides a case study of how governments
lose credibility on immigration by tolerating growing gaps between
immigration policies and realities. France announced in 1974 that
foreign workers from outside the EU could no longer enter France
as probationary immigrants. <BR>

<P>
French politicians assured anxious publics that immigration had
been stopped. However, family unification and illegal immigration
continued. Local residents often failed to appreciate the categories
through which newcomers entered; they only knew that foreigners
were still arriving in their neighborhoods. As a result, governmental
credibility declined to the point that, in some polls, the most
credible spokesperson on immigration issues in France today is
the National Front leader Jean-Marie Le Pen.<BR>

<P>
Continuing immigration has complicated the process of integrating
especially the four to five million Muslims immigrants in France.
At the beginning of the 20th century, France successfully integrated
Italian and other Catholic immigrants by persuading them fairly
quickly to learn French; familiarity with French and French culture
also expedited the integration of immigrants from French colonies.
<BR>

<P>
France is today debating how best to integrate Muslim and Black
African immigrants who may have less appreciation for French and
French culture. In some neighborhoods, as many as 30 different
languages are spoken. 
<H1><A NAME="_Toc337341661">The Instruments of Integration Policy--What
works?</A> </H1>

<P>
Integrating resident foreigners is described as a top priority
in France, Germany, and the US, but there is remarkably little
agreement on the best public policy instruments to integrate foreigners.
However, most participants agreed that learning the native language
was important for economic success and to minimize native fears
of foreigners, and that the schools were the key to integrating
the second generation.
<H2><A NAME="_Toc337341662">France</A> </H2>

<P>
Some French politicians argue that policies that successfully
integrated immigrants in the past no longer work, and that what
is needed is an immigration stop, coupled with a renewed effort
to restructure housing and welfare policies and reverse the trend
toward family breakup. In language that echoes California Governor
Pete Wilson, it was asserted that the minimum welfare assistance
of roughly 2800FF ($550) per month offered to immigrants in France
keeps them from seeking employment.<BR>

<P>
The list of problems attributed to or aggravated by immigrants
in France is long, and this leads to the calls for an immigration
stop. What is less clear is how to seek solutions, and where to
start. <BR>

<P>
For example, some argue that the starting point for integrating
immigrants in France is to start with their housing--demolish
the high-rise apartment blocks that concentrate them far from
jobs, and segregate immigrant children in schools.<BR>

<P>
Another key to integration, some believe, is to change the structure
of the French government. France gives considerable power to mayors--many
members of the National Assembly are also mayors--and the need
to be re-elected allegedly prevents mayors from assembling and
coordinating the regional resources necessary to help immigrants
get access to housing, transportation, and jobs. A return to central
power, it was argued, is necessary to get the French economy moving
again, as well as to integrate foreigners by imposing sometimes
unpopular housing and schooling policies at the local level.<BR>

<P>
Others would put more money into educating immigrants. There are
two problems with this approach. First, hiring teachers for immigrant
schools, or social workers for their parents, may not integrate
immigrants already isolated from French children and jobs. <BR>

<P>
Second, France has little latitude for additional public expenditures.
France already collects more of what the economy produces in taxes
than any other major industrial country--44 percent of GDP was
collected in taxes in 1993, versus 40 percent in Germany, and
30 percent in the US. <BR>

<P>
The new government in 1995 raised the minimum wage as well as
the standard VAT or sales tax to 20 percent and, despite promises
of deregulation to stimulate private sector job creation to reduce
the 12 percent unemployment rate, the tradition of a strong central
government in France makes it tempting to try to spend any additional
integration resources in a top-down fashion, but with deference
to local politicians.<BR>

<P>
Neither France nor Germany encourages immigrants to naturalize,
but France makes naturalization easy for most children born in
France.
<H2><A NAME="_Toc337341663">Germany</A> </H2>

<P>
The German naturalization dilemma is that there is no consensus
on the ultimate aim of integration. According to some Germans,
naturalization should be the goal of integration, so that Germany
stops re-producing foreigners within its borders.<BR>

<P>
However, Germany is reluctant to admit that it is a country of
immigration, and thus it is hard to agree on a package of measures
that immigration countries would consider natural, including explicit
guidelines on who can immigrate and naturalize. Under German policies
adopted in 1981, foreigners age 16 to 23, with 8 years residence
and six years of German schooling, can be naturalized practically
automatically.<BR>

<P>
Germans noted the significant differences between integration
programs for ethnic Germans and other foreigners. Upon their arrival,
descendants of Germans who emigrated to the former USSR--sometimes
hundreds of years ago--are entitled to German citizenship as well
as six months of language training, and welfare payments and job
search assistance. Other newcomers, by contrast, do not have access
to special integration services, although there are a variety
of job training programs available to foreign-resident youth.
<BR>

<P>
Muslim immigrants are a special concern in Germany, even though
they are less than half of the immigrant population. There are
widespread fears that fundamentalist teachers will turn disaffected
youth into a potential anti-native underclass, but most efforts
to head off such a result seem to be local and spontaneous rather
than national efforts that most observers believe will work.<BR>

<P>
There was a lengthy discussion of why European governments who
have acknowledged integration issues are so slow to act. Some
French participants emphasized that there remain significant differences
among EU countries in policies that range from naturalization
to controlling drugs, so that immigration and integration issues
are as likely to lead to confrontation among EU states rather
than cooperation. Examples of &igrave;naturalization dumping&icirc;--Turks
moving to France so that their children can more easily be naturalized--are
undoubtedly rare, but are invoked to argue that Schengen border
controls cannot be lifted right away.<BR>

<P>
Most economic and social indicators of integration indicate that
foreigners are poorer and less educated than the native born.
As with the US Black-white unemployment rate, the unemployment
rate for foreign workers in Germany is twice the rate for the
native born. More detailed analyses indicate that there are also
significant differences in economic indicators by ethnic group,
with the most different groups--Turks in Germany, or Blacks and
Muslims in France--at the bottom of labor market and earnings
pyramids.
<H2><A NAME="_Toc337341664">United States</A> </H2>

<P>
The US has few immigrant integration programs, aside from refugee
resettlement and bilingual education programs. Instead, the US
typically &igrave;assigns&icirc; individuals to groups, allows
representatives to negotiate for the group, and manages to integrate
groups in the resulting social change. <BR>

<P>
The current wave of immigrants to the US is becoming &igrave;Americanized&icirc;
but, since most newcomers move into central cities filled with
a US underclass, many immigrants are integrating by adapting to
central city values, including illegitimate births, welfare, and
crime.<BR>

<P>
The &igrave;group integration&icirc; of the US allows the characteristics
of a subgroup to represent the entire group. Even though less
than one-fourth of the roughly 15 million foreign-born Hispanics
in the US are illegal immigrants, Latino immigrants are often
tagged with the illegal label. <BR>

<P>
According to some Americans, the major mechanism for integrating
minority groups, including immigrants, are the tools developed
in the Civil Rights movement of the 1960s. It is for this reason,
it is argued, that Latino immigrants have adopted the position
of a minority needing government assistance to be integrated in
the US. <BR>

<P>
Latinos, in this view, had the bad luck to arrive in the US at
a time when the Civil Rights instruments of integration have been
discredited, but before other integration instruments were developed.
<BR>

<P>
Opinion on immigration in the US has been volatile and has changed
quickly over the past year. In the early 1990s, there was discussion
of new federal expenditures to expedite the integration of immigrants.
In 1995, there is widespread agreement that legal and illegal
immigration should be reduced, and the social service system scaled
back. <BR>

<P>
The US must deal with three areas that affect the integration
of immigrants as well as other fundamental aspects of US society.
First, what services will the government provide, and on what
terms? Second, what happens to the US assumption of upward mobility
in a static economy? Third, what policies will the US develop
to broker ethnic differences?<BR>

<P>
Governments on both sides of the Atlantic are scaling back the
welfare state, and deregulating their economies. As a result,
immigrants will have to fend more for themselves in restructuring
economies and societies. <BR>

<P>
Early this century, immigrants fending for themselves in industrializing
America achieved substantial social and economic upward mobility,
and in many cases helped to produce the modern welfare state as
a reaction against some attributes of market economies. It is
not clear what immigrants fending for themselves in post-industrial
and slow growing societies will produce.
<H1><A NAME="_Toc337341665">Attacking the Root Causes</A> </H1>

<P>
International migration is a big business. There are some 60 million
foreigners in the world's 24 richest nations, and the half of
them in the labor force send at least $40 to $50 billion each
year to their countries of origin. In countries from Algeria to
ex-Yugoslavia, remittances are a major source of foreign exchange.
<BR>

<P>
Could the industrial democracies that are trying to reduce unwanted
immigration provide emigration countries with trade, investment,
and aid in a manner that reduces unwanted immigration? And, if
trade concessions are opposed by some sectors of immigration countries,
such as farmers and steel workers, can the fear of unwanted migration
be used to nonetheless adopt free-trade policies?<BR>

<P>
In 1990, the &quot;One-World Group&quot; of European public television
networks produced a film, &quot;The March&quot; designed to show
viewers that it would be better to provide more aid to Africa
than to deal with the arrival of desperate African migrants. There
is no evidence that such efforts to convince taxpayers to step
up development assistance have succeeded; aid budgets have not
increased significantly.
<H2><A NAME="_Toc337341666">Trade</A> </H2>

<P>
There is no disagreement that immigrants tend to flow from poorer
to richer countries, but, in a world in which per capita income
differences are on the order of 25 to 1 between rich and poor
countries, the surprise may be how little, not how much, international
migration for employment occurs. <BR>

<P>
In spite of demand-pull, supply-push, and network factors that
could be expected to increase migration across borders, only about
two percent of the world&iacute;s population lives outside their
country of citizenship, and less than 10 percent of the population
of most industrial countries were born abroad.<BR>

<P>
The most significant economic policy change in the 1990s is the
worldwide shift toward free markets. In industrial countries,
market opening is evidenced by free trade pacts, including the
EU-92 program in Europe, and by the deregulation of labor and
other markets.<BR>

<P>
But the adoption of free market programs has been most noticeable
in several of the major developing countries from which many migrants
come. Mexico, Turkey, and the Philippines, for example, have announced
ambitious plans to privatize state-run industries, open themselves
to free trade and investment, and deregulate their labor and product
markets.<BR>

<P>
These free market policies should, over time, speed up economic,
job, and wage growth, and thus reduce economically-motivated migration.
But the transition from a closed to an open economy is neither
easy nor assured of success.<BR>

<P>
Indeed, most economists believe developing nations that embrace
free market policies first experience <B>increased</B> pressures
favoring outmigration. This makes it very hard for an industrial
country such as the US to embrace freer trade with an emigration
country such as Mexico. US opponents of such free trade policies
can complain that jobs will flee south, while workers will flee
north, and this job loss-migration hump may persist for a generation
or more.<BR>

<P>
Furthermore, free trade policies may not succeed. There is no
assurance that simply adopting such policies will automatically
produce faster growth. Free market policies tend to have high
failure rates, for reasons that include corruption, the replacement
of public monopoly with private monopoly, and policy mistakes.
<BR>

<P>
In light of the migration hump and uncertainty of success, why
embrace free trade and investment? The answer is simple--there
is no alternative strategy that has proven its ability to accelerate
economic growth and thereby reduce emigration pressure.<BR>

<P>
Free trade enables emigration countries to grow their way out
of emigration pressure--both countries ride up the escalator toward
more jobs and higher wages, but the emigration country rises faster,
much as Europe &quot;caught up&quot; with the US in the 1960s.
There is an alternative--wage gaps can also be lessened by the
migration of workers from low to higher wage countries, reducing
the growth of wages in industrial democracies. <BR>

<P>
But a migration-induced narrowing of wage differences has different
socio-economic consequences. Emigration areas that live off remittances
can turn into bedroom communities for foreign labor markets, so
that migration depresses wages in the immigration country, and
does not generate stay-at-home development. The result can be
dependence on a foreign labor market, and tensions over immigration.
<H2><A NAME="_Toc337341667">Cautions</A> </H2>

<P>
There are several problems associated with implementing policies
to free up trade and investment and thereby reduce emigration
pressures. First, the process through which economic transformations
generate faster growth are neither smooth nor sure. Many emigration
countries depend on tariffs for 30 to 40 percent of government
revenues, so changing economic policies means that the government
has fewer resources when the need for assistance is greatest.
<BR>

<P>
Second, industrial countries often urge emigration nations to
adopt free trade policies, but then they restrict imports of precisely
those goods that emigration nations are most capable of exporting,
such as agricultural and labor-intensive commodities. <BR>

<P>
Third, there is no assurance that free trade policies will &igrave;work.&icirc;
Success depends on many factors, including confidence, and policy
mistakes can quickly turn a country such as Turkey or Mexico from
success to pariah. In many cases, it makes little sense for a
government to adopt the free trade and investment policies if
the &igrave;fundamentals&icirc; are not in place. There is probably
little current investor interest in, for example, Algeria, even
if the government rolled out the red carpet for foreign investors,
and this situation is likely to persist until the conflict is
resolved.
<H2><A NAME="_Toc337341668">Aid</A> </H2>

<P>
One difference between European and American attitudes toward
policies to reduce emigration pressures is captured in the adage:
Americans believe in trade, not aid, while Europeans want aid,
not trade. The US gives very little aid to Mexico, but signed
NAFTA, while Europe keeps out many North African agricultural
commodities but provides significant aid.<BR>

<P>
In 1994, the OECD countries provided $58 billion in aid to developing
nations. However, much of this aid flows from one government to
another, and little of it is concentrated in emigration areas
to deter emigration. 
<H1><A NAME="_Toc337341669">Focus on France</A> </H1>

<P>
France is a country of 58 million with an average per capita income
of about $22,000. The 1995 election was fought largely over how
to deal with the country's persistent 11 to 12 percent unemployment
rate, or how to avoid the reinforcement of a two-tiered society
with an underclass of French and foreign residents.<BR>

<P>
France is Europe&iacute;s traditional country of immigration.
France was practically unique in having an early fertility decline
beginning as early as the late 18th century, and fear of population
decline that would make the country more vulnerable to rival Germany
prompted both pro-natalist and expansionary immigration policies.
France was among the world&iacute;s first countries to develop
an immigration system, and France has what is for Europe an easy
path to naturalization. <BR>

<P>
The second unique aspect about French immigration is the so-called
&quot;Republican model&quot; of integration, which asserts the
need for a commonality of French language and culture--both French
rural-urban migrants as well as immigrants were expected to learn
French and behave as the French do in public. Any language, religious,
or cultural differences should be celebrated only in private.
<BR>

<P>
This system worked reasonably well to integrate European immigrants,
and immigrants from former French colonies familiar with the French
language and culture. Today, almost one in three French residents
is believed to have at least one foreign-born grandparent. 
<H2><A NAME="_Toc337341670">Past and Present</A> </H2>

<P>
Past immigrants were integrated into French society by a combination
of a relatively easy path to citizenship--virtually all children
born in France can become French citizens at age 18; secular schools
that inculcated French and French values; by the assembly-line
organization of the military and heavy industries that integrated
both immigrants and rural to urban French migrants; and by the
Catholic church.<BR>

<P>
These integrating institutions assured that children born or educated
in France considered themselves French as adults. The French,
in turn, were confident that they could use their language and
culture to integrate foreigners--foreigners from any of the 27
countries that use French as an official language, such as Belgium
and Lebanon, can naturalize as soon as they receive residence
permits in France, instead of waiting for at least two years.
<BR>

<P>
Today, there is less certainty in France and elsewhere that past
integrating instruments will work for today's immigrants. One
thing that makes France unique is that, unlike other immigration
countries that are experimenting with bilingual education and
religious diversity in public places, many French policy makers
resist changing policies that have &quot;worked.&quot; Others
say that it is high time that France wake up to the new immigration,
the new Europe, and the new world of migration.
<H2><A NAME="_Toc337341671">Residence and Work</A> </H2>

<P>
Foreigners in France for more than three months need residence
permits--one-year residence permits are usually obtained for 200FF
($40) after 20 minute interviews with the French immigration police.
After three years of continuous lawful residence and employment,
or 10 years lawful residence, a foreigner can obtain a ten-year
residence permit for 250FF.<BR>

<P>
Several areas of Paris, such as Sentier near the Gare du Nord,
are known to harbor significant numbers of illegal alien workers.
France until 1991 attempted to curb illegal alien employment by
removing illegal alien workers from workplaces, and perhaps from
France. Since 1991, immigration police and labor inspectors put
much more emphasis on sanctioning employers and labor smugglers-middlemen.
<BR>

<P>
In 1991, the French developed a fax system that enables employers
to check on the legal status of newly hired workers--employers
fax copies of residence and work permits to the police and labor
departments and, if there is no response from the authorities,
the worker is legal. The percentage of newly-hired workers believed
by these departments to be unauthorized in targeted industries
such as garments has fallen from one-third to 10 percent.<BR>

<P>
Immigration and labor inspectors receive tips from other employers,
and from each other, about places in which illegal aliens are
employed. Since 1993, they have another source of tips--employers
must report newly-hired workers at least eight days before hiring
them to social security, not within eight days of putting them
to work. In this way, inspectors can be alerted by the social
security system before illegal workers go to work.<BR>

<P>
The Sentier area is a garment manufacturing district that hires
significant numbers of illegal aliens in sewing lofts above display
shops. There is a general level of tolerance for illegal behavior
in the area, from traffic violations to prostitution. However,
tightened labor law enforcement has apparently pushed much of
the sewing involving illegal workers to the suburbs.<BR>

<P>
The French government has recently taken several highly visible
steps against illegal immigration, including the chartering of
airplanes to return illegal aliens to their countries of origin.
For historical reasons, the government is careful with both the
language and the form of transportation--aliens are returned,
not deported, and planes rather than trains are used to take aliens
to borders, partly because of fears that opponents of such policies
will associate them with Nazi deportations by train during World
War II. <BR>

<P>
Most experts believe that the charter airplanes are symbolic actions.
They point to a host of problems. It is expensive to charter planes,
and so the authorities wait until they have a plane load of aliens.
But French law permits detention of aliens awaiting return for
only 10 days, so that, if a full plane load of aliens is not available,
the government must set aliens free or take off with a partial
load. Many countries refuse to accept back persons who do not
have papers proving that they are e.g., Algerians.
<H2><A NAME="_Toc337341672">Schools and Integration</A> </H2>

<P>
Many French teachers are convinced that the key to integration
is learning French--in the words of one, &quot;own language instruction
is the road to failure.&quot; Indeed, in France, own language
instruction was advocated by those in the 1970s who hoped that
it would encourage return migration.<BR>

<P>
The result was a contradictory &quot;policy&quot; toward integration
that satisfied no one. Indeed, French teachers asserted that with
respect especially to young foreign children from homes in which
the parents wanted their children to learn French, it is feasible
and desirable to take non-French speakers into regular French
classes and, within several months, have the foreign children
speaking and working in French. This immersion approach, they
noted, also helped to integrate the foreigners socially.<BR>

<P>
In Germany, foreign children have had the right to attend K-12
schools since 1964. Germany is sensitive about the problems involved
in integrating older foreign children--especially those older
than 10 when they arrive in Germany.<BR>

<P>
Germany has a decentralized school system--each Land or state
is responsible for developing a curriculum, including how to teach
foreign children. German regulations have changed to prohibit
family unification of children over age 15, under the theory that
older children will be unable to learn enough in German schools
to succeed on the German labor market.<BR>

<P>
The German experience can be seen as a half empty or half full
glass. Optimists note that the number of foreign children completing
the vocational training for which Germany is famous has been rising,
as has the number of foreign children who go to university-preparatory
schools (Gymnasium).<BR>

<P>
However, pessimists note that more than 40 percent of foreign
youth fail to finish the equivalent of high school and, of those
who obtain vocational training, many of the foreign children select
sunset occupations such as mechanic or hairdresser. German handicraft
employers such as bakers are willing to take on foreign apprentices,
but some fear that these declining industries might be using foreigners
as cheap workers.<BR>

<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>In France, recent immigrants often find themselves
stranded in housing developments in Paris suburbs such as Monfermeil
about one-third of whose 26,000 residents are foreign. The area
has no direct transportation into Paris, and offers little industry
and few jobs. The few who are employed must travel more than an
hour to low-paying jobs in Paris. Los Bosquets, which occupies
three percent of the town, has 20 percent of its 20,000 population--most
of whom are first- or second-generation immigrants. Unemployment
is 25 percent.<BR>

<B>9-10:45 AM Immigration Patterns and Policies in Industrial
Countries<BR>
</B>
<P>
Speakers: Michael Teitelbaum, Sloan Foundation and Vice Chair,
U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform and Jonas Widgren, Director,
International Center for Migration Policy. Moderator: Philip Martin,
Professor, University of California, Davis. 
<P>
<B>Discussion Questions</B>
<P>
&iuml; Immigration policy involves three fundamental questions:
how many immigrants should be admitted, from where should they
come (or who should have priority to enter), and in what status
should immigrants enter. How are industrial countries answering
these questions? Whose interests tend to be most important in
making <B>and</B> enforcing entry rules? What time dimensions
enter into immigration debates? 
<P>
&iuml; What are current immigration flows into industrial countries?
How can we compare or rank countries in their openness to immigrants?
Is a society's openness to immigrants in any manner analogous
to its openness to foreign goods? 
<P>
&iuml; Is there an upper limit on the annual influx of foreigners
or on the foreign share of the population (Canada adds almost
one percent to its population annually via immigration; the U.S.
about 0.4 of one percent; in Switzerland, foreigners are 18 percent
of the population; in Germany, nine percent; in the U.S., eight
percent). Are such comparisons of immigration flows and stocks
misleading because each country has a different understanding
of the term &quot;immigrant.&quot; In the US, for example, most
of the foreigners have a right to become citizens, while most
foreigners living in Switzerland are not expected to become citizens.
How are foreigners/immigrants integrated into a new society?
<P>
&iuml; What influences the &quot;absorptive capacity&quot; of
a nation? Gross numbers? History? Demography and Economics? Geography?
Regional concentration/dispersal of immigrants? 
<P>
&iuml; What determines the range of views on how easy it will
be to integrate particular groups of immigrants? Is &quot;absorptive
capacity&quot; affected by the number and type of immigrants arriving,
socio-economic conditions when they arrive, or the speed with
which their arrival changes the ethnic/racial/religious composition
of the population? 
<P>
&iuml; Should the annual inflow of immigrants be set by an annual
ceiling or &quot;quota?&quot; Should the intake of immigrants
vary with domestic socioeconomic conditions, such as the unemployment
rate, or with international events, such as the number of refugees
and asylees seeking entry? How can annual limits be enforced?
<P>
&iuml; How large is the contribution of immigration to population
and labor force growth? In a country with a declining native population,
such as Germany, should immigration be used as a policy to prevent
the population from shrinking?<BR>

Unskilled Immigration?<BR>
</B>
<P>
Speakers: Philip Martin, Professor, University of California,
Davis and Thomas Straubhaar, Professor, Universit&auml;t der Bundeswehr
Hamburg. Moderator: Elizabeth Midgley, President, Working English.
<BR>

<P>
<B>Discussion Questions</B>
<P>
&iuml; The focus on this session is <B>whether, why, and how</B>
the influx of unskilled workers into industrial societies should
be regulated. Illegal workers can be converted into legal workers
or immigrants via temporary worker programs and amnesties, so
we want to discuss--from economic, political, and social points
of view--<B>whether, why, and how </B>an industrial country should
attempt to control entries. 
<P>
&iuml; Presentations will make reference to three points. First,
to what extent are the benefits of unskilled migrant workers in
an industrial society such as the U.S. immediate and concrete
in the form of higher profits for some employers, and concentrated
in the hands of a relatively few people? To what extent are any
costs associated with unskilled immigration delayed, diffused
across society, and difficult to measure, since they include integration
issues? 
<P>
&iuml; Second, why is there so much controversy over the economic
effects of migrant workers in industrial democracies? Theory would
suggest that the presence of migrant workers should raise profits
and depress wages, increase total employment and unemployment,
and slow the search for labor-saving change. Why do researchers
have such a hard time finding any significant such effects? There
will be a discussion of examples of the effects of immigrants
in particular sectors, such as nursing, construction, agriculture,
hotels and restaurants, and garments. 
<P>
&iuml; Third, what would happen to these sectors and to the economy
as a whole without immigrant labor? How should non-specialists
think about the trade-offs involved in front-door legal immigration,
side-door guestworker migration, and back door illegal immigration?

<P>
&iuml; The U.S. is the world's major country of immigration, Mexico
is the world's major country of emigration, and most Mexican immigrants
historically arrived as illegal or irregular aliens who were later
legalized. How have demand-pull, supply-push, and network factors
evolved between Mexico and the U.S.? Which factors are most important
in explaining current migration flows? What is the prospect that
the North American Free Trade Agreement will break these links,
and over what time periods are NAFTA's effects expected to be
visible?<BR>

<P>
&iuml; We will be traveling to Mexico to visit some of the &quot;maquiladoras&quot;--foreign-owned
assembly plants--that employ about 1 in 5 Mexican manufacturing
workers. To what extent does trade in the labor-intensive goods
assembled in these plants substitute for migration? If these factories
employ mostly young women, do they also draw young men to the
border area who later cross the border illegally? How are patterns
of Mexican migration to the United States changing after NAFTA.

Immigration Patterns and Policies 1

Why Regulate Unskilled Immigration ? 2
<P>
Can Trade be a Substitute for Migration? 4
<P>
Practical Options for Managing Illegal Immigration 5
<P>
Prop 187 6<BR>

<P>
The purpose of the seminar was to explore four major questions:

<P>
&iuml;what is the gap between immigration policy goals and outcomes
in the US and Western Europe? 
<P>
&iuml;why should industrial countries try to regulate unskilled
immigration?
<P>
&iuml;can trade and investment arrangements such as NAFTA reduce
emigration pressures?
<P>
&iuml; what are practical options to deal with unskilled immigration
pressures? These questions were framed by Europeans and Americans,
discussed in a general session, and then in small groups. In addition,
these issues were discussed during the field trips. <BR>

<P>
Immigration Patterns and Policies<BR>

<P>
The opening session noted that there have been enormous and unanticipated
changes in the US and around the world over the past three decades.
These changes have given the US far more immigrants, especially
from Asia, and neither the increased number of immigrants, nor
the rise in Asian immigration, was anticipated.<BR>

<P>
The US made four major changes in its immigration policies during
the past three decades: in 1965, 1980, 1986, and in 1990. In each
case, the unanticipated consequences have been as significant
as the expected effects of these immigration reforms.<BR>

<P>
Many Americans do not believe governmental promises that efforts
to control illegal immigration will soon succeed. This national
failure to manage illegal immigration has produced an anti-immigrant
reaction, especially in California. Managing migration has become
the number one issue in the nation's largest state.<BR>

<P>
European nations are getting immigrants, but they have not yet
accepted the responsibility to deal with immigration prospectively
and realistically. For example, Europeans still avoid discussing
the three fundamental immigration questions of how many, from
where, and in what status immigrants should arrive.<BR>

<P>
The number of immigrants arriving in Europe has been racheting
upward despite tough talk, new laws, and even departure bonuses.
Europe's major political parties have primarily been reactive,
trying to do enough to blunt the appeal of anti-immigrant parties
so that immigration does not dislodge the parties that have run
Europe for the past five decades.<BR>

<P>
Most experts believe that European governments must become forward-looking,
taking steps to prevent unwanted migration, and developing a GATT-analog
General Agreement on Migration Policies (GAMP) to promote the
coordination of efforts to manage migration.<BR>

<P>
It was generally agreed that <U>pressures</U> to cross national
borders will rise rather than fall in the years ahead, but it
was emphasized that rising migration pressure or potential does
<U>not</U> necessarily mean rising migration. In other words,
there was not a consensus that the only choice open to the receiving
countries is whether to accept migrants through front, side, or
back doors--indeed, most participants believed that migration
management was both possible and should be given higher priority
by governments.<BR>

<P>
It was also agreed that the fear of the stranger is real and can
easily be exploited. The recent civil rights/individual rights
revolution resulted in an elite consensus not to play the &quot;immigration
card&quot; for political purposes, but California's Proposition
187 may be a harbinger of change.<BR>

<P>
It is also clear that ideas that would have been scoffed at even
five years ago get a respectable hearing today. These include
using military intervention to prevent disruptive migration, as
in Haiti, taking at least symbolically tough steps to reduce unwanted
migration, as exemplified by Proposition 187 in California , police
checks in France, and the German law that requires public employees
to report suspected illegal aliens.<BR>

<P>
There was a general concern that the growing gap between immigration
policy goals and outcomes could lead to larger problems. For example,
it was noted that Germany and the Scandinavian countries believe
that they can prevent illegal immigration, so they hew to legal
and illegal categories, with the result that some public employees
feel forced to become immigration agents. France and the US, on
the other hand, are more likely to accept their inability to eliminate
illegal immigration, leading to incomplete amnesties and the development
of schemes through which some rights are granted to illegal aliens.
<BR>

<P>
Second, it was emphasized that voters at the bottom of the labor
market could express their frustration at the gap between immigration
goals and outcomes by voting for anti-immigrant parties or taking
direct action against foreigners. Third, it was emphasized that,
in a global economy linked by freer trade and capital flows, relations
between nations can be disrupted by immigration disputes.<BR>

<P>
Why Regulate Unskilled Immigration ?<BR>

<P>
Most of the immigrants arriving in industrial nations are unskilled,
meaning that they have less than the median level of education
of native-born adults. Since immigration pressures are rising,
and immigration control is getting more difficult, this session
asked a simple question--why bother with control, or how much
resources and energy should be devoted to controlling unskilled/illegal
immigration?<BR>

<P>
It was emphasized that this question has been avoided regularly
by immigration commissions in the US. Their normal justification
for doing more to curb illegal immigration is that, in a nation
of laws, illegal immigration is wrong and, if it persists, antipathy
toward illegal immigrants might lead to a less open front door
to legal immigrants.<BR>

<P>
Immigrants in industrial countries are a small part of the worldwide
labor force and a marginal part of industrial country workforces,
so that any effects they have will be marginal for both developing
and industrial nations. It was also noted that economic theory
finds that it is not optimal to completely stop unwanted activities
such as pollution and illegal immigration because the costs of
achieving a zero level outweigh the benefits.<BR>

<P>
But perhaps the most interesting observation was that, in Europe,
it seems to be easier for blue-collar workers to push society
toward a &quot;too restrictive&quot; immigration policy, while
in the US employers and ethnic groups have been able to organize
themselves to get a &quot;too open&quot; policy toward unskilled/illegal
immigration.<BR>

<P>
Immigration is neither good nor bad; it produces economic and
other tradeoffs. Three economic tradeoffs seem especially important
in evaluating unskilled immigration. First, unskilled immigrants
on balance hurt unskilled native workers through wage depression,
displacement, and changing patterns of hiring and training. However,
these changes affect less than 20 percent of all native workers,
and many occur in a fashion that is not visible to in statistical
studies of immigrant impacts. The fact that these impacts are
not easy to measure does not mean that they do not exist.<BR>

<P>
Second, the availability of immigrant workers affects the evolution
or trajectory of those sectors of the economy where immigrants
are concentrated. In the US economy, there are only three occupations
with 1 million or more workers in which immigrants are a majority
of the workforce--farmworkers (2.5 million), janitors (2 million),
and household help (1 million). These sectors are also not well
studied in comparison to other economic sectors, so it is not
always easy to see what would happen without immigrants. However,
in the case of agriculture, the termination of the bracero program
in 1964 spurred a cost-reducing series of innovations that made
the US a world leader in processed tomato products.<BR>

<P>
Third, the immigrants arriving in the US today, if arrayed by
the best single predictor of earnings, years of education, have
an hourglass or barbell shape. This means that current immigration
patterns are increasing economic inequality.<BR>

<P>
The discussion emphasized that immigrants have many economic effects,
sometimes improving the position of some native workers, as when
unskilled immigrants in the fields create or preserve jobs for
truck drivers. It was also noted that the trajectory of an industry
is not shaped just by immigration. In US transportation industries,
for example, the major changes in the labor market are traceable
to de-regulation.<BR>

<P>
The discussion also emphasized that foreigners willing to work
for low wages can affect domestic workers directly via immigration,
or indirectly through trade and investment flows. <BR>

<P>
The discussion concluded with a consensus that, if unskilled/illegal
immigration is to be controlled in the 1990s, countries need have
flexible policies that adapt to changing patterns of movement.
Economic differences between industrial and developing countries
are widening, increasing incentives to enter industrial countries
enough so that e.g., Chinese nationals pay $30,000 to be smuggled
into the US to fill unskilled jobs.<BR>

<P>
Can Trade be a Substitute for Migration?<BR>

<P>
This question was answered simply: yes, and free trade and investment
are the only instruments guaranteed to eventually reduce migration
pressures. But there is a short-run migration hump, meaning that
the disruptions and dislocations associated with deregulating
and opening an economy increase migratory pressure. If there are
established migratory links, the same polices that reduce migration
in the long run can increase migration in the short run.<BR>

<P>
Labor migration is a big business. The remittances sent to countries
of origin by the 20 to 25 million foreign workers in industrial
countries are in the $40 to $50 billion range, as each worker
remits perhaps $2000 annually. If the industrial countries were
to succeed in stopping migration, or removing the foreign workers
already there, countries of origin might lose a major source of
foreign exchange.<BR>

<P>
Economic growth is the ultimate answer for economically-motivated
migration, but economic growth does not have to equalize wages
to stop migration. Analyses and experience suggest that once economic
differences are reduced to 4 or 5 to 1, and there is confidence
that wages will continue to increase in the country of origin,
migration pressures fall sharply.<BR>

<P>
The world community has not yet figured out how to deal with economically-motivated
migration in international organizations and agreements. Most
countries are avowedly not destinations for immigrants, making
them more likely to cooperate to reduce immigration than to establish
the rules under which it should occur. However, regional trade
agreements, which tend to be more comprehensive than global agreements
such as the GATT, increasingly deal with migration.<BR>

<P>
Mexico is the ninth most populous country in the world, with about
90 million people and a labor force of about 30 million. The country
grew rapidly with an import substitution policy during the 1950s
and 1960s, and thought that it could continue this policy when
oil prices rose in the 1970s. Debt rose, oil prices fell, and
in 1982 the country was in crisis.<BR>

<P>
Mexico changed its economic policies in the mid-1980s, embracing
policies that aimed to attract foreign investment and to create
jobs in export-oriented industries. One of the fastest-growing
sectors of the Mexican economy have been maquiladoras, the 2000
factories in the border areas that employ 500,000 Mexican workers
to turn imported components into products that are mostly exported
to the US. <BR>

<P>
NAFTA plus &quot;correct&quot; economic polices in Mexico promise
faster economic growth in the 1990s. But the need for faster economic
growth is larger than even freer trade and investment can provide--Mexico
has 1 million new workforce entrants annually, so that even creating
500,000 &quot;real jobs&quot; each year is not sufficient for
new entrants plus those displaced from inefficient industries
such as agriculture. Furthermore, Mexico has a very unequal distribution
of income, so that the benefits of fast growth are not automatically
shared in a manner that leaves especially poor people in rural
Mexico satisfied with their lot.<BR>

<P>
Mexican researchers expect illegal Mexican immigration, estimated
at 800,000 to 2 million entries per year today, to decline significantly
after NAFTA plus Mexico's current polices have been in effect
for at least 10 years--50 percent of the Mexican estimate of 800,000
illegal entries were apprehended at least once by the US Border
Patrol. However, the next 10 years promise very contentious debates
over persisting illegal immigration. <BR>

<P>
There is a fundamental difference in the definition of the migration
problem. Mexicans see migration as an economic issue. They note
that it is not the bottom of the Mexican workforce that migrates
to the US, and that the wages earned by unauthorized immigrants
in the US are just as legitimate as the profits earned by their
US employers. The Mexican perspective is that if the US really
wanted to stop illegal immigration, it would crack down on US
employers, since their demand for Mexican workers is what motivates
Mexicans to cross the border.<BR>

<P>
The US perspective, in the Mexicans' view, is that unauthorized
Mexican workers are criminals. This prevents, they say, useful
negotiations toward a bilateral migration agreement. <BR>

<P>
Europeans tend to favor aid rather than trade to reduce migration
pressures, in part because many of the emigration countries would,
with freer trade, export agricultural products to Europe. In other
words, agricultural protections are in part responsible for urbanization
and migration pressures from Morocco to Turkey. <BR>

<P>
In the case of Morocco, freer trade would make the country an
agricultural exporter. But freer trade alone would cause problems,
one of which is that Morocco now gets one-fourth of its governmental
revenue from import tariffs. <BR>

<P>
The discussion emphasized that there are significant differences
in US-Mexican relations along the 2000 mile border. Even though
northern Mexico is richer than other parts of Mexico, San Diego
is one of the richer areas of the US, while the TX border towns
are among the poorest in the US. Border Patrol operations that
reduce apprehensions sharply are popular in both areas. <BR>

<P>
Practical Options for Managing Illegal Immigration<BR>

<P>
There were very different practical options discussed. One approach
is to review the various control options tried, to emphasize the
flaws in each, and to conclude that the best option is to manage
inevitable migration. For example, fortifying the border is expensive,
and its long-run effectiveness is not yet clear. Eliminating social
services for unauthorized aliens may not have much of a deterrent
effect on migrants seeking jobs, and may complicate the provision
of services to so-called mixed families that include members with
a variety of legal statuses.<BR>

<P>
The other approach is to acknowledge that no control measure is
a magic bullet cure, but that enforcement measures can have effects
on migration at the margin, and can send symbolic messages to
the public that something is being done. The US now enforces on
targets of opportunity--such as Prop 187's attempt to detect those
who seek public services--and enforces indiscriminately--as when
all Haitian boat people are returned without screening.<BR>

<P>
A strategy of detection and detention/deportation was urged. Once
an illegal alien is detected, there must be, it was argued, a
procedure to determine quickly who is not eligible to remain,
and then those persons must be removed quickly in order to avoid
the development of equity stakes that lead to exceptions(the US
deported only 38,000 aliens in 1993).<BR>

<P>
Island nations such as the UK tend to rely on border controls,
and not on internal controls such as employer sanctions. Nations
with many borders and mass tourism industries such as France tend
to place most of their enforcement emphasis on interior controls.
Each country is debating how to engage in interior controls that
are effective while respecting human rights. What may seem overly
intrusive in one country is considered normal in another, such
as France's random ID checks on the streets, versus the opposition
to a national work permit in the US. These differences in what
are acceptable controls help to explain why international coordination
in immigration control efforts may be so difficult to achieve.
<BR>

<P>
It was also emphasized that the willingness to embrace immigration
controls depends on how much of a problem such immigration is
perceived to be. Many of those who recoil at e.g., national work
permits believe that illegal immigration is not a serious problem,
and are thus not willing to support what they see as an &quot;extreme&quot;
solution.<BR>

<P>
Prop 187<BR>

<P>
The seminar concluded with a discussion of Prop 187, the California
ballot initiative that was approved by a 59 to 41 percent vote
on November 8, 1994. Prop 187 can be modified only with a 2/3
vote of the California Legislature or by another initiative.<BR>

<P>
Prop. 187 has five major sections. First, it bars illegal aliens
from the state's public education systems from kindergarten to
university, and requires public schools to begin verifying the
legal status of both students (on January 1, 1995) and their parents
(on January 1, 1996). Second, all providers of publicly-paid,
non-emergency health care services must verify the legal status
of persons seeking services in order to be reimbursed.<BR>

<P>
Third, Prop. 187 requires that all persons seeking cash assistance
and other benefits verify their legal status before receiving
benefits. Fourth, all service providers are required to report
suspected illegal aliens to California's Attorney General and
to the INS, and police must determine the legal status of persons
arrested. Fifth, the making and use of false documents is now
a state felony.<BR>

<P>
Some of these provisions&nbsp;restate current law, such as barring
illegal aliens from cash assistance programs, but add a California-administered
verification procedure. Other provisions conflict with current
law, such as those barring illegal alien children from schools,
and these conflicts will have to be resolved in the courts before
they are implemented.<BR>

<P>
The discussion generally decried the denial of education and health
care services to persons needing them. There was little disagreement
on the goal of doing more to reduce illegal immigration, and it
was suggested that better border and interior enforcement, as
well as persuading Mexico to cooperate in preventing illegal exits,
would be preferable to the Prop 187 approach. However, it was
noted that, at least in the case of public education, the major
argument against denying access is that the children will stay,
which implicitly says that the US cannot control illegal immigration.
<BR>

<P>
The seminar ended on a consensus note that immigration issues
are likely to become more rather than less important, and that
issues such as Prop 187 will push the issue ever higher on national
and international agendas.<BR>

Questions</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&iuml; Immigration involves three fundamental questions:
how many, from where (or who should have priority to enter), and
in what status should immigrants enter. How are industrial countries
answering these questions? Whose interests tend to be most important?
What time dimensions enter into immigration debates? </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&iuml; What are current immigration flows into industrial
countries and how do countries rank in their openness to immigrants?
Is there an upper limit on the immigrant share of the population
(Switzerland, 17 percent; Germany, 9 percent; or the US., 8 percent)
or are such numbers misleading because each country has a different
understanding of who an immigrant is, and how immigrants are integrated
into a new society?</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&iuml; What influences the absorptive capacity of
a nation? Gross numbers? History? Demography and Economics? Geography?
Regional concentration/dispersal of immigrants? Views about cultural
homogeneity vs. multiculturalism? Is the absorptive capacity affected
by the speed at which the ethnic/racial/religious composition
of the population changes? Should the annual inflow of immigrants
be set by an annual ceiling or &quot;quota.&quot; Should it vary
with domestic socioeconomic conditions such as the unemployment
rate, or with international events, such as the number of refugees
and asylees?</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&iuml; How large is the contribution of immigration
to population and labor force growth e.g., in a country with a
declining native population, such as Germany, where immigration
prevents the population from shrinking?<BR>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&iuml; Worldwide, there are 18 million refugees.
However, 1 to 2 million asylum applicants already in the industrial
country in which they want to stay: what is the proper balance
of effort and expenditure on these groups. Have industrial countries
created incentives for refugees to become asylum applicants, e.g.
,should a refugee who is protected in a second country be prohibited

<FONT SIZE=2>&iuml; If EC- or North American Free Trade Agreement-style

<B>Summary</B>
<P>
The purpose of the seminar was to discuss the fundamental issues
behind current European immigration and integration issues among
40 opinion leaders in an off-the-record setting. The seminar was
held in N&uuml;rnberg, so that participants could observe German
officials deciding asylum cases in nearby Zirndorf.
<P>
Five topics were addressed, ranging from worldwide immigration
patterns to the issue of whether Germany should introduce dual
nationality. This report summarizes the discussion of each issue.
<BR>

<P>
<B>Migration Patterns and Policies</B>
<P>
The world appears to be on the move. There are an estimated 100
million immigrants, refugees and asylees, and authorized and unauthorized
workers living and often working outside their country of citizenship.
If this &quot;nation of migrants&quot; were assembled in one place,
it would be equivalent in size to the 10th largest nation in the
world.
<P>
Second, this &quot;nation of migrants&quot; has a significant
impact on both emigration and immigration areas. Emigration nations
receive at least $75 billion annually in remittances, making labor,
by some estimates, second only to oil as the world's most important
traded good. Most of the world's migrants move from one developing
country to another--the industrial democracies of Western Europe,
North America, and Asia have only about 40 percent of the world's
migrants--but immigration is nonetheless a top domestic priority
in Brussels, Washington, and Tokyo because a significant share
of the migrants they host are &quot;unwanted,&quot; and entry
pressures seem to be rising rather than falling.
<P>
Third, industrial democracies that coordinate policies in areas
from defense to economics to the environment are only at the beginning
stages of coordinating their immigration and integration policies.
The coordination process is furthest along in Western Europe,
where the European Union has taken the first steps to coordinate
policies on asylum seekers and visa entry requirements. However,
when viewed in the familiar tri-polar sense of Europe, America,
and Asia, the surprise is that immigration and integration are
still perceived quite differently in each area, making it hard
to find a common basis for coordination.
<P>
There are two competing visions of immigration that make it hard
for an interested citizen to know whether she should welcome or
fear the prospect of more immigrants. Two anecdotes from the United
States illustrate the hopes and fears about immigrants on both
sides of the Atlantic. The optimistic extreme flows from past
fears that proved to be groundless. In the 1750s, Benjamin Franklin
worried that Germans would not learn English, and thus become
unassimable, yet two centuries later, Dwight Eisenhower, a descendent
of these German immigrants, was a U.S. President.
<P>
The pessimistic extreme is embodied in the probably apochraphyl
story of a dying Indian chief in the American midwest at the end
of the 19th century. The young braves gathered around his deathbed
asked: what was your generation's biggest mistake. His reply:
we failed to control the immigration of the white man.
<P>
Both of these cases emphasize that the truly important consequences
of immigration may not be apparent for decades. It is also important
to remember that emigration and immigration played very different
roles in nation-building on the two sides of the Atlantic. Even
though France and Germany were destinations for immigrants at
the turn-of-the-century, the process of nation-building in Europe
was shaped more by emigration than immigration including, in some
countries &quot;laws of return&quot; and policies that transmit
citizenship through parents, even if parents and child are far
from Western Europe. In the United States, by contrast, a nation
of immigrants was quick to embrace the notion that the act of
starting over in a new land was an important tie binding together
diverse immigrants, so that the path to naturalization was easy
for all, and especially easy for those born in the country, who
became U.S. citizens by their birth.
<P>
Migration has played different roles in nation-building in the
old and new worlds, but the common challenge of dealing with high
and rising immigration pressures, as well as integrating the newcomers
who have arrived, may lead to a convergence in migration policies.
For example, most recent immigration policy reforms have had a
Grand Bargain quality &ntilde; a restrictionist policy such as
stopping guestworker recruitment in Western Europe in 1973-74
was accompanied by an admissionist policy that permitted the families
of settled guestworkers to join settled guestworkers. Similarly,
the United States in the mid-1980s coupled the introduction of
sanctions on employers to deter illegal entries with an amnesty
for some of the illegal aliens who had settled or worked in the
country.
<H2>The Goal-Outcome Gap<BR>
</H2>

<P>
This Grand Bargain approach to dealing with migration problems
reflects the competing optimistic and pessimistic visions of how
immigrants will ultimately be viewed by the receiving country.
But Grand Bargain approaches to immigration reform guarantee frustration,
a sense that governments are unable to articulate and implement
consistent migration policies.
<P>
There are several reasons why Grand Bargains fail, including the
fact that people eager to migrate to another country are flexible
and quick to learn, so that packages of toughness and generosity
tend, over time, to error on the side of generosity. For example,
no amnesty program is complete &ntilde; there are always persons
who just miss the work or residency cutoff dates and, if they
plead their cases, are legalized or at least tolerated. Enforcement
efforts, on the other hand, typically lag behind the ingenuity
of workers and employers who want to begin a mutually beneficial
work relationship.
<P>
These factors combine to help migration channels to widen over
time. In this sense, migration is unlike trade between countries.
Trade channels tend to narrow over time unless international organizations
and treaties stiffen the resolve of national governments to resist
special interests who would like to block imports of particular
commodities. There are no international organizations or treaties
aimed at narrowing migration channels directly &ntilde; indeed,
humanitarian organizations such as UNHCR and economic organizations
such as the OECD and ILO have promoted international refugee and
labor migration. A relaxed international environment and the ingenuity
of eager migrants makes the pressures different in trade and migration
matters.
<H1>International Labor Migration </H1>

<H2>A World on the Move </H2>

<P>
There appears to be a great deal of confusion on basic migration
facts. Three seem important:
<P>
- most people don't move; most people never cross national borders
to live or work in another country
<P>
- most migrant workers move from one developing country to another
<P>
- countries that have successfully made the transition from exporting
to importing labor range from Korea to Spain. 
<P>
Given economic differences between nations, the surprise may be
how <I>little</I> international migration occurs.
<P>
The world's population in 1994 is about 5.6 billion, and almost
3.5 billion people are in the 15 to 64 age group from which the
world's 2.5 million workers are drawn. The world's population
and its potential work force are increasing by 80 to 85 million
persons annually. 
<P>
Neither people nor income are distributed equally around the globe.
The World Bank divides the countries on which it collects data
into 22 &quot;high-income&quot; and about 100 middle and low income
countries. High-income countries--the United States and Canada,
Western European nations such as from Sweden to Spain, and Asian
countries such as Japan, Singapore, and Australia--include 15
percent of the world's population, but they accounted for over
three-fourths of the world's $22 trillion GDP in 1991. The average
income in these rich countries was over $21,000 annually, versus
a worldwide average $4000.
<P>
These data suggest that an average person from one of the poorer
100 countries could increase his or her income 5 to 6 times by
moving into one of the 22 richest countries. Young people are
responding to the opportunity to &quot;go abroad&quot; for opportunity,
but most of them travel only a short distance to another developing
country. About 60 percent of the world's &quot;nation of migrants&quot;
is in developing countries, and there is a great deal of not-well-studied
labor migration between developing countries.
<P>
However, the 40 or so million immigrants, refugees and asylees,
and authorized and unauthorized migrant workers in the industrial
democracies are an important socio-economic and political issue.
Many are unwanted, in the sense that their settlement was not
anticipated--as with guestworkers who settled in Western Europe
or applicants for asylum whose claims that they would face persecution
at home are rejected, but who nonetheless are allowed to stay.
The United States recognized as legal about 9 million immigrants
who arrived since 1982, but one-third of them initially arrive
illegally, and then had their status legalized. Polls in North
America and Europe indicate that a majority of the public wants
such unwanted immigration curbed.
<H2>Why International Migration? </H2>

<P>
One hundred years of migration research has identified three major
factors that influence economically-motivated international migration.
They are: 
<P>
- demand-pull factors that draw migrants into another country,

<P>
- supply-push factors that encourage migrants to leave their own
countries, and
<P>
- networks of friends and relatives already settled in destination
countries who serve as sources of information and anchor communities
for newcomers. 
<P>
The relative importance of each factor changes over time in particular
migration streams.
<H1>Demand Pull </H1>

<P>
Most labor migrations began in the industrial countries, as employers
there, with or without explicit government approval, recruited
migrant workers. During the early years of such labor migrations,
demand-pull factors so dominate that, in Germany during the 1960s,
the annual influx of workers could be explained almost entirely
by fluctuations in the German unemployment rate, giving guestworker
countries a false assurance that they really can regulate with
precision migrant worker flows.
<P>
However, in what has become a familiar story, demand-pull, supply-push,
and network factors evolved to prove the aphorism that there is
nothing more permanent than temporary workers. In all of the industrial
democracies, migration has seemingly taken on a life of its own,
with migrants continuing to arrive in Western Europe, the United
States, and Japan despite historically high unemployment rates.
Migrant workers are often prized for their flexibility: they are
willing to accept jobs that offer low wages, unpleasant or seasonal
work, or unusual hours. As a result, migrant workers are found
in the same industries and occupations in all industrial democracies:
construction, agriculture, and service jobs that offer low wages,
such as restaurants and hotels, or night and weekend work, such
as nursing. 
<P>
Relatively few migrant workers are employed in industries in which
trade in place of migration is a near term option. Labor-intensive
manufacturing industries such as garments and shoemaking are often
dependent on migrant workers and protected from developing nation
imports, but freeing up trade in goods would directly affect less
than one-fourth of the migrant workers in industrial countries.
Thus, while free trade is desirable as a means to accelerate economic
growth, it will not immediately curb the desire to employ migrant
construction workers, janitors, and nurses.
<H2>Supply Push </H2>

<P>
The demand-pull of jobs in industrial democracies is matched neatly
by the supply push of low wages and joblessness in the developing
countries from which most migrant workers come. About 5 in 6 of
the world's workers are in the world's poorer nations, and every
year another 80 million workers join the 2 billion strong workforce
there. This leads to an enormous job creation challenge. Developing
nations from Mexico to Turkey to the Philippines must create from
500,000 to 1 million new jobs annually for the youth who every
year enter the workforce. In addition, they need to find jobs
for the 20 to 40 percent of the workforce that is currently unemployed
or underemployed. On top of these job creation challenges, developing
nations must find jobs for ex-farmers and workers who are not
seeking work because there aren't enough jobs. 
<P>
Two examples help to illustrate the dimensions of the job creation
challenge. Almost half of the workforce in developing nations
are farmers, but 1 billion farmers are not needed to produce the
world's food and fiber--in the industrial democracies, less than
5 percent of the workforce produces such an abundance that rich
countries feel compelled to subsidize prices and incomes for their
farmers. Developing countries, on the other hand, often tax their
farmers by requiring them to sell their cotton or coffee at below
world prices to a government agency, which in turn exports the
commodity at the world price and pockets the difference. Farming
thus generates only one-fourth to one-third of the average income
in countries such as Mexico and Turkey, and ex-farmers crowd booming
cities from Mexico City to Manila. Once rural residents migrate
to these capital cities, it is much easier for them to migrate
aboard, either by boarding an airplane and, a day or two later,
arrive in Frankfort or Los Angeles, or making contact with a middleman
who promises to smuggle them abroad.
<P>
A second example of the job creation challenge facing the world
is the fact that many workers in developing nations do not seek
work because they know jobs are scarce. In the industrial democracies,
half of the population is typically in the workforce, so that
the United States, with a population of 260 million, has a workforce
of about 130 million. In developing nations, one-third of the
population is typically in the workforce, so that Mexico, with
90 million people, has a workforce of about 30 million. Many of
the Mexicans who are not in the workforce are urban women who
would seek jobs they were available.
<H2>Network </H2>

<P>
The demand pull of jobs is linked to the supply push of low wages
and joblessness by migration networks. Migration networks encompass
everything that enables people to learn about opportunities abroad
and take advantage of them. These networks or linkages have been
shaped and strengthened by three of the major revolutions of the
past generation: the communications revolution, the transportation
revolution, and the rights revolution.
<P>
The <I>communications revolution</I> refers to the fact that potential
migrants know far more about opportunities abroad than did turn
of the century migrants from southern and eastern Europe who set
out for North and South America and Australia. As in the past,
the major source of information is countrymen already settled
abroad who can tell the migrants about opportunities in Paris
or Los Angeles, and in many cases provide advice and funds to
migrate, legally or illegally. The industrial democracies perhaps
unwittingly add to their allure by portraying, in TV shows such
as Dallas and Dynasty that are exported even to the remote corners
of the globe, a life of opulence. 
<P>
Some migrants have their expectations raised by these portrayals
of life in the industrial democracies, and many hope to achieve
a better life for themselves by migrating to the just slightly
richer areas. Others are motivated to go abroad by contractors,
labor brokers, and other often shadowy middlemen who promise,
for a fee often equivalent to 1/4 to 1/2 of a migrant's first
year's earnings abroad, access to the promised land.
<P>
The <I>transportation revolution</I> is simply the fact that the
cost of traveling has dropped enormously, while convenience has
increased geometrically. Even the most remote peasant is less
than one week away from the bright lights of New York--once he
gets to the capital city of his country, the international network
of flights can take him anywhere within a day or two for less
than the average monthly earnings of even an unskilled and seasonal
worker in an industrial country, $1000 to $2000. 
<P>
The third revolution that encourages migration is the <I>rights
revolution</I>, or the spread of individual rights and entitlements
within many nations. All of the industrial democracies have strengthened
personal rights vis-a-vis government agencies, and most have signed
international treaties that, for example, commit them to provide
refuge to those fleeing persecution. One effect of this rights
revolution is that, once an migrant arrives in an industrial country,
he or she can avoid deportation for 2, 3, or even 4 years. 
<P>
While a migrant's case winds its way through the legal system,
industrial countries face a Hobson's choice. If they prohibit
the migrant from working because his legal right to do so is in
doubt, then the government must support the migrant. If the migrant
is permitted to work, then the humanitarian right not to be returned
to persecution becomes a backdoor guestworker program.
<H2>The Migration Challenge </H2>

<P>
Demand pull, supply push, and network factors are evolving in
ways that encourage more migration. In light of these easily understandable
forces, the world should be on the move, and it may seem to some
that it is: the migrant nation is 100 million strong, and it has
in recent years been increasing by between 2 and 4 million annually
in the industrial democracies. 
<P>
But the surprise to many observers is how few, not how many, migrants
move into the industrial democracies. Most people do not move:
most people will live and die within a few miles of their birthplace.
International migration remains an extraordinary event despite
the evolution of demand, supply, and network factors that encourage
migration. Furthermore, most of those who migrate internationally
move only a short distance, so that 60 percent of the world's
migrants move from one developing nation to another. One unlikely
country, Iran, includes almost one-fourth of the world's 19 million
refugees.
<P>
The 40 million migrants in the industrial democracies <B>are</B>
significant. But it should be emphasized that most people do not
migrate despite ever more incentives to do so. The industrial
democracies are not being overrun by a tidal wave of immigrants.
The migration challenge remains manageable, and responsible policymakers
may not be well-served by doomsday scenarios such as those painted
in the film <U>March from Africa</U>, in which desperate Africans
set out for Europe accompanied by news crews while political leaders
there debate what to do to stop them. The logical quick fix for
such mass migrations is tight border controls and relief outside
the industrial democracies to avoid rights and settlement, but
there are steps that can be taken to avoid such crises.
<H2>Industrial Country Responses </H2>

<P>
How are the industrial democracies responding to the migration
challenge? Despite long-run forces promoting convergence, there
are considerable differences between the policy responses in Western
Europe, North America, and Asia. <BR>

<P>
Philip Martin studied Labor Economics and Agricultural Economics
at the
<P>
University of Wisconsin-Madison, where he earned a PhD in 1975.
<BR>
<P>
Martin has published extensively on farm labor, labor migration,
economic
<P>
development, and immigration issues. He has testified before Congress
and
<P>
state and local agencies numerous times on these issues, and was
the only
<P>
academic appointed to the 12-member Commission on Agricultural
Workers to
<P>
assess the effects of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of
1986 on US
<P>
farmers and workers. Since 1987, Martin has chaired the WRCC-76,
a group of
<P>
35 researchers from land-grant universities that meets annually
to discuss
<P>
research on the effects of immigration reform on US agriculture.
<BR>
<P>
Martin has been asked to develop practical solutions to complex
and
<P>
controversial migration and labor issues in many countries. Between
1988 and
<P>
1990, he assessed competing predictions of how many Turks might
emigrate if
<P>
Turkey were admitted to the European Union. In 1994, he evaluated
the
<P>
effects of immigration on Malaysia's economy and its labor markets.
In 1995,

	<font size=6>About Migration Dialogue</font><p>
	</center><p>

Migration is a global challenge for the 21st century.  In a world of 185-odd nation states, each of which regulates who can cross its borders, there are about 125 million people living outside their country of citizenship.  This "nation of migrants" is equivalent in size to the world's eighth largest nation, Japan, and is growing by two to four million annually, faster than world population growth.  
<p>
Most of the world's 5.8 billion people never cross a national border and, when they do, most move only a short distance, from one developing nation to another.  But over half of the world's migrants are in the world's 15 richest nations, making foreigners or foreign-born residents five to 10 percent of the populations of the United States, Germany, and France.  Immigration accounts for almost half of US population growth, and prevents population decline in Germany.
<p>
The industrial democracies are divided about how to deal with immigration.  Many residents of the industrial democracies want immigration reduced.  Efforts to reduce immigration take many forms, from arson attacks on foreigners' homes in Germany, to political parties committed to stopping immigration in France, to enormous increases in expenditures on border controls in the US.
<p>
At the other extreme, some call for open borders, because, they allege, industrial countries cannot democratically control immigration, or because rich countries should open themselves to economic migratns and refugees.
<p>
<a href="http://migration.ucdavis.edu/mda/mdtxt.htm">Migration Dialogue</a> promotes an informed discussion of the issues associated with international migration in industrial democracies by providing unbiased and timely information on immigration and integration issues to opinion leaders in government, media, and academic circles.  Its goal is to bolster the middle of a debate that lends itself to calls for extreme actions:  it is our belief that durable solutions to migration issues are to be found in this broad middle.
<p>
Migration Dialogue accomplishes its goals with five reinforcing activities:
<ul>
<li>Migration Briefs.  These are 50 to 75 page balanced treatments that explore the tradeoffs inherent in making migration decisions.  The briefs are aimed at opinion leaders interested in international affairs, and each helps readers to think through issues such as the linkages between population growth and immigration, refugees and foreign policy, and migration and the environment.
<li>Migration Speakers.  This is a list of nonpartisan and balanced materials and migration speakers.
<li>MD Seminars.  Migration Dialogue sponsors an annual intensive three-day seminar for American and European opinion leaders to consider, in an off-the-record setting, immigration issues in a comparative perspective.  These seminars permit elected officials, journalists and other leaders of opinion to learn about immigration issues in other industrial democracies.  Each seminar includes several field trips that enable participants to discuss these issues with immigrants as well as employers, service providers, and local officials.
</ul>

<P>
Some 45 UC faculty and graduate students interested in comparative
migration issues held a workshop October 4, 1996 at UCD.
<H1><A NAME="_Toc369335440"><FONT SIZE=5>Immigration and Welfare
Reform</FONT></A><FONT SIZE=5> </FONT></H1>

<P>
Susan Martin, Executive Director of the Commission on Immigration
Reform, discussed the origins, provisions, and likely consequences
of three major three major laws that had their origins in the
1994 and 1995 recommendations of the Commission on Immigration
Reform: the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, signed
into law on April 24, 1996, the Personal Responsibility and Work
Opportunity Reconciliation Act, signed into law on August 22,
1996, and the Immigration Control and Financial Responsibility
Act, signed into law on September 30, 1996.<BR>

<P>
There is never a &quot;good time&quot; to make immigration policy,
and 1996 was particularly difficult because of the need to find
savings in government expenditures, and American insecurity and
frustration.<BR>

<P>
The CIR's recommendations were based on two principles. First,
the US should do more to reduce illegal immigration. To accomplish
this goal, CIR recommended that the borders be &quot;managed&quot;
to prevent the entry of illegal immigrants, increasing penalties
for smuggling, and testing systems to help employers determine
quickly and reliably who is legally authorized to work in the
US. <BR>

<P>
Second, the CIR recommended that the US strike a &quot;grand bargain&quot;
on legal immigration--reduce the growth of immigration, but maintain
legal immigrants' full access to the social safety net. Specifically,
CIR recommended that the US speed up the admission of immediate
family members of immigrants living in the US, but eliminate the
right of brothers and sisters of US citizens to immigrate.<BR>

<P>
Congress adopted many of the CIR's recommendations to reduce illegal
immigration, but rejected the CIR's grand bargain proposal.
<H1><A NAME="_Toc369335441"><FONT SIZE=5>Illegal Immigration</FONT></A><FONT SIZE=5>
</FONT></H1>

<P>
The CIR urged a three prong effort to reduce and deter illegal
immigration: prevent entry over borders, prevent those inside
the US from getting jobs or benefits and, if detected, quickly
remove illegal aliens from the US.<BR>

<P>
Congress agreed to add Border Patrol agents and support personnel
to deter illegal entries over US borders, and also agreed to add
staff to expedite legal entries. However, Congress did not add
significantly to efforts to prevent illegal aliens in the US from
getting jobs: US employers may, but do not have to, participate
in experimental employee verification systems. The INS will get
1200 more inspectors, including 900 whose primary responsibility
is to deal with employer sanctions and alien smuggling.<BR>

<P>
However, at the last minute, Congress refused to authorize the
hiring of 350 more labor inspectors to the DOL.
<H1><A NAME="_Toc369335442"><FONT SIZE=5>Removing Aliens</FONT></A><FONT SIZE=5>
</FONT></H1>

<P>
The anti-terrorism bill made it easier to remove from the US aliens
who are convicted of felonies in the US. Once apprehended, criminal
aliens must be detained, and they have fewer opportunities to
appeal to stay in the US and, under the new immigration law, they
may be required to serve their sentences in their country of origin,
if the US negotiates agreements with other countries.<BR>

<P>
The immigration bill also made it easier to exclude foreigners
who enter the US without valid documents. If an unauthorized alien
applies for asylum to remain in the US, she must make a credible
claim to an INS asylum officer. If the INS officer rejects her
claim as not credible, then she has one appeal to an immigration
judge, who must make a decision within 7 days. <BR>

<P>
Unauthorized aliens in the US for seven or more years may apply
for &quot;suspension of deportation,&quot; an acknowledgment that,
over that time, the alien may have developed US roots. However,
Congress adopted a tougher standard for suspension of deportation,
and limited the number of foreigners who can obtain this relief
to 4000 per year.<BR>

<P>
The new immigration law allows the US Attorney General to deport
without any judicial review any illegal alien apprehended inside
the US, who has been in the US for less than two years. 
<H1><A NAME="_Toc369335443"><FONT SIZE=5>Legal Immigration</FONT></A><FONT SIZE=5>
</FONT></H1>

<P>
According to Susan Martin, the US legal immigration system, which
manages immigration by backlogs or waiting lists, needs a major
overhaul. Over 1.1 million spouses and children of legal immigrants
living in the US are waiting--up to 10 years--to come to the US.
Many do not wait; they come illegally. Similarly, there are 1.7
million siblings, such as the adult brothers and sisters of US
citizens, in the Philippines, Mexico, and other countries waiting,
sometimes 20 to 30 years, until they receive permission to migrate
legally to the US.<BR>

<P>
The CIR recommended that the US eliminate immigration slots for
brothers and sisters of US citizens. However, an unusual alliance
between business and religious and ethnic groups prevented changes
to the legal immigration system, but not changes to the US welfare
system that make most legal immigrants ineligible for benefits.
<BR>

<P>
The CIR recommended that the US draw a firm line between the access
of legal and illegal immigrants to welfare and other public assistance
in the US. The CIR recommended that illegal immigrants receive
only emergency services, and those authorized by the US constitution,
including K-12 education for illegal alien children. <BR>

<P>
The CIR recommended that legal immigrants be eligible for the
same public assistance services as US citizens, but that sponsorship
agreements be made legally binding--if a US citizen or legal immigrant
agreed to support a relative, and that relative, after arriving
in the US, applied for welfare, the applicant would be assumed
to have access to the income and assets of the sponsor, and thus
likely not be eligible for benefits. <BR>

<P>
In order to sponsor the admission of an immigrant, a US resident
would have to earn at least 125 percent of the poverty line for
the sponsor and the immigrant(s) who would arrive, and sign an
affidavit promising to support the immigrant in the US. The US-sponsor
could have another US-cosponsor.<BR>

<P>
The welfare law makes newly-arrived legal immigrants not eligible
for most welfare benefits for at least five years after their
arrival in the US. 
<H1><A NAME="_Toc369335444"><FONT SIZE=5>What's Next?</FONT></A><FONT SIZE=5>
</FONT></H1>

<P>
Susan Martin believes that immigration, which accounts for about
40 percent of US population growth, will continue to be a prominent
issue in the US and California. Four issues not addressed in 1996
are likely to get attention: legal immigration, refugees, immigrant
policy, and the administration of US immigration.<BR>

<P>
Martin believes that the US will eventually have to strike some
type of Grand Bargain of the sort recommended by the CIR because.
With legal immigration rising, and welfare services ending, poor
immigrants may become more vulnerable and visible. <BR>

<P>
Second, the end of the cold war has eliminated the major rationale
for refugee admissions over the past 50 years--providing a haven
for those fleeing communism.
<P>
The US must rethink what it wants to accomplish with refugee policy--just
who among the world's 25 million refugees should US admit to start
over in the US?<BR>

<P>
Third, the US has admitted about 15 million immigrants since 1980,
and many of them are not faring well in the US economy. As immigrants
and US citizens compete in a labor market crowded by ex-welfare
recipients, the US may have to consider immigrant integration
policies.<BR>

<P>
Fourth, the INS is one of the few federal agencies whose budget
has doubled in a time of reduced government spending. The US needs
to study what has become a large and expensive system for managing
immigration.
<H1><A NAME="_Toc369335445"><FONT SIZE=5>California Implications</FONT></A><FONT SIZE=5>
</FONT></H1>

<P>
Phil Romero explained why Governor Wilson in the early 1990s led
a campaign to reduce illegal immigration. The 1991-92 recession
increased the demand for state-funded services, but made it impossible
to pay for more state services. However, immigration continued
to bring large numbers of people into the state who needed state-funded
services, including unauthorized aliens.<BR>

<P>
According to Romero, Wilson thought that the federal government
should either reimburse CA for the cost of providing services
to illegal aliens, or prevent their entry. When the federal government
did neither, Wilson endorsed a state effort to reduce services
to unauthorized aliens, Proposition 187. <BR>

<P>
David Illig explained that the major assistance programs affected
by 1996 immigration and welfare legislation include AFDC, which
had about 380,000 legal immigrants on the rolls in summer 1996,
Food Stamps, with about 436,000 non-US citizen recipients, SSI,
with 331,000 immigrant recipients, and in-home supportive services,
with 55,000 non-US citizen recipients. Perhaps 500,000 non-US
citizens now receiving one or more welfare benefits may lose them
under 1996 legislation.<BR>

<P>
The major fear in CA is that, as non-US citizens are removed from
welfare rolls, state and local government may have to provide
assistance to them. Under CA law, county governments must provide
locally-paid-for General Assistance to persons not eligible for
any other benefits who need assistance, and in July 1996, about
150,000 persons in CA were receiving assistance that cost county
governments $300 to $400 million per year.<BR>

<P>
CA politicians are waiting until after the November 1996 elections
to decide how to respond to the non-eligibility of most newly-arrived
immigrants for welfare benefits, and the removal of immigrants
from the welfare rolls. Among the options are to prolong the eligibility
of current immigrant recipients--non-US citizens currently receiving
Food Stamps can continue to do so until April 1, 1996, encourage
naturalization, or simply ignore federal sanctions that are threatened
if CA does not remove immigrants as the law requires. <BR>

<P>
One proposal is to have parallel welfare programs in CA--a 100
percent federally-funded program that meets all federal criteria,
and a 100-percent state-funded program that would permit e.g.
people to draw benefits longer than five years, and perhaps serve
some immigrants.
<H1><A NAME="_Toc369335446"><FONT SIZE=5>Los Angeles and San Diego</FONT></A><FONT SIZE=5>
</FONT></H1>

<P>
Roger Waldinger, UCLA, discussed the conclusions to his book,
Ethnic Los Angeles. Waldinger noted that, in 1990, about 33 percent
of LA county residents, and 37 percent of LA city residents, were
foreign born, comparable to the foreign born share of the population
of New York City in 1910. <BR>

<P>
However, while New York City has experienced immigration continuously
for two centuries, Los Angeles experienced mass immigration only
since 1980. Today, 55 percent of the immigrants in the US live
in five cities, including 20 percent in Los Angeles, and 18 percent
in New York City.<BR>

<P>
In Los Angeles, Mexicans are the dominant immigrant group, and
most of them have very little education--over half of the adult
Mexican immigrants in 1990 in Los Angeles had less than eight
years of education. <BR>

<P>
Waldinger believes that social networks and economic development
evolved in ways so that the supply of unskilled immigrants created
a demand for them in &quot;niches,&quot; industries and occupations
in which an immigrant group is over represented, compared to its
share of the work force, by 50 percent or more. One of the most
striking findings of this niche analysis is that Mexican immigrants
are over-represented in low wage industries such as non-durables
manufacturing, and in occupations such as gardening, while African-Americans
are over represented in government jobs.<BR>

<P>
Commentator Dan Walters, Sacramento Bee, stressed the difference
in the characteristics of the population of CA--about 53 percent
of state residents are non-Hispanic whites--and voters in CA--about
80 percent of the voters are non-Hispanic whites. White voters
are older than the average residents, setting up potential ethnic
and age political conflicts that, Walters believes, will continue
to be resolved in favor of the older whites. <BR>

<P>
Some institutions are trying anticipate and plan for these demo-political
changes. Only 20 percent of CA voters still have children in K-12
public schools, which may have contributed to Prop 98, which guarantees
state funding for K-12 schools.<BR>

<P>
Finally, Walters argued that the 1996 naturalization wave has
not yet shown up on voter rolls. There are 19 to 20 million eligible
voters in CA, 14 million registered voters, and 9 million votes
cast in November 1994--Hispanics cast 8 to 9 percent, or 800,000
of these votes.<BR>

<P>
Wayne Cornelius, UCSD, reported on a comparative study of employers
and workers in San Diego and Japan that is examining whether foreign
worker employment fluctuates over the business cycle. Preliminary
analysis suggests that, employers dependent on foreign workers
do not lay off immigrant workers and hire natives when natives
are presumably more available.
<H1><A NAME="_Toc369335447"><FONT SIZE=5>Los Angeles and Amsterdam</FONT></A><FONT SIZE=5>
</FONT></H1>

<P>
Ivan Light, UCLA, summarized his contribution to a book that compares
immigration's effects on the garment industry in Los Angeles and
Amsterdam. In contrast to Saskia Sassen, who argues that globalization
creates a demand for immigrant workers by increasing the incomes
of the very rich who demand immigrant services from gardening
to maids, Light stresses that social networks enable immigrants
to cross borders and find jobs by lowering the cost and risk of
migrating. <BR>

<P>
Combining globalization and network theories yields a &quot;spillover&quot;
or threshold date, when migration switches from being mostly a
demand-pull to mostly a supply-push phenomenon. <BR>

<P>
Light notes that, in the LA garment industry, jobs are being created
by immigrants for immigrants. <BR>

<P>
Joshua Skov, UCB, noted that the globalization theory seems to
concentrate on structural explanations for migration, while networks
emphasize agency factors.
<H1><A NAME="_Toc369335448"><FONT SIZE=5>Mexico&iacute;s Labor

<P>
Agustin Escobar, <FONT COLOR=#000000>Ciesas Occidente, Guadalajara,
reviewed the evolution of Mexico's labor market since the 1980s,
and emphasized that the number of 16-64 year olds, many of whom
would be expected to join the labor force, increased much faster
than the number of jobs, both formal and informal. However, the
informal sector has lost some of its ability to serve as Mexico's
shock absorber after 1989, so that, as the mobility of Mexicans
increased, more Mexicans moved to border cities within Mexico,
and from Mexico to the US.<BR>

<P>

<FONT COLOR=#000000>The </FONT>Bi-National US-Mexican Migration
Study was proposed by Mexico to quantify migration between Mexico
and the US, and the US and Mexico, as well as the characteristics
of migrants, factors that sustain migration, the impacts of migration
in both countries, and policy responses. The study will be completed
in summer 1997.<BR>

<P>
There were 4.5 million Mexican-born persons in the US in 1990,
according to the Census, and 6.7 million in March 1996, according
to the CPS. Mexicans in the US have traditionally come from the
lower ends of the Mexican education and skill ladder, in part
because Bracero farm workers were recruited. Migration seems to
be less selective today than in the past; there are more urban
residents, more migrants with skills, and from new regions of
Mexico.<BR>

<P>
Demand-pull, supply-push, and network factors sustain Mexico-US
labor migration, but their roles have changed. Demand-pull factors
have declined in importance, and supply-push and network factors
have increased in importance.<BR>

<P>
As Mexico-US migration has increased in magnitude, changed in
character, and sustained by factors other than US-government approved
recruitment, the context of US-Mexican relations, as well as the
context for dealing with migration, has changed. <BR>

The CGES Comparative Immigration and Integration Program held
its sixth Workshop on Friday, January 26, 1996 at the Lewis Center
for Regional Policy Studies at University of California at Los
Angeles. Three papers were presented and discussed by the 40 faculty
and students who participated, and an afternoon panel discussed
programs of research on immigration's impacts on California. 
<BR>

<P>
The purpose of the CIIP is to promote interdisciplinary and comparative
research on immigration and integration issues facing the industrial
democracies. The CIIP each year funds 10 to 20 faculty researchers,
and 10 to 20 graduate student projects, and holds two to three
work shops. The CIIP supports the production of Migration News
each month, which goes to 2000 readers around the world. <BR>

<P>
In 1996, the CIIP plans to inaugurate an annual research conference
with German immigration and integration researchers. <BR>

<P>
<B>Announcements</B>. The RFP for faculty and graduate student
CIIP awards for 1996 were announced; faculty proposals are due
by February 29, 1996, and graduate student proposals are due March
8, 1996. Grant letters will include an explicit statement that
faculty receiving CGES-CIIP awards are expected to be active members
of the work group, which means participation in CIIP workshops,
and submitting CIIP working papers. For a copy of the RFP, contact
Gia White at <FONT COLOR=#000000>gia@uclink.berkeley.edu--tel

<P>
<B>Minutes. </B>Participants are working on a variety of comparative
projects, ranging from whether some firms in industrial democracies
are structurally dependent on immigrant workers to how the local
effects of immigrants in turn influence a nation's immigration
policies.<BR>

<P>
Ivan Light (UCLA) presented a paper on anti-immigrant movements,
noting that many anti-immigrant groups argue that they are acting
in the &quot;national interest.&quot; Light emphasized that it
is very hard to define the national interest, and that what may
seem to be in the national interest in one period can be shown
to have not been in the national interest in a later period. For
example, Hitler's aim for racial and ethnic purity left Germany
in ruins, while the 1960s decision to admit guest workers added
both economic growth and diversity.<BR>

<P>
The discussion emphasized that it is very hard to define the &quot;national
interest,&quot; and that what is considered to be the national
interest may simply reflect the relative strength of interest
groups at a point in time. Immigration rose in all the industrial
democracies over the past 30 years--does this reflect a consensus
that it is in the national interest to open borders, or the operation
of international pressure and domestic interest groups? <BR>

<P>
Philip Martin (UCD) presented a paper entitled &quot;Guest Workers
for Agriculture: New Solution or New Problem?&quot; The purpose
of guest or foreign worker programs aim to add workers to the
labor force without adding permanent residents to the population,
but Martin noted that none of the world's 100-plus countries with
guest worker programs has succeeded in having their programs adhere
strictly to this goal.<BR>

<P>
The worldwide experience with guest workers is captured in the
aphorism &quot;There is nothing more permanent than temporary
workers. &quot; No where is this statement more true than in US
agriculture. Martin contrasted past and current certification
and contractual programs with the current push of US farmers for
an attestation and free-agent program, concluding that it is unlikely
Congress will approve a free agent program for unskilled seasonal
workers, but that farmer pressure might lead to a further &quot;streamlining
of the certification and contractual H-2A program.<BR>

<P>
The discussion emphasized that many of the lessons from US experience
with past guest worker programs are not well understood. For example,
Operation Wetback in 1954 resulted in 1.1 million apprehensions
during what was then a July-1953-June 1954 fiscal year. Most of
these apprehensions occurred at the border--there were only 80,000
apprehensions during the height of the June-August interior sweeps.
<BR>

<P>
In other words, most apprehensions have been and continue to be
at the border, and it is very hard to judge the total size of
the Mexican influx from apprehension data. However, most participants
expressed skepticism of assertions that &quot;tens of millions&quot;
of Mexicans have been employed illegally in the US--the source
of such assertions appears to be a 1989 LA Times poll in Mexico
in which about 30 percent of the Mexicans polled reported that
they had a relative living in the US.<BR>

<P>
Bill Frey (U-Michigan) presented a paper on internal migration
dynamics in the US. According to census data on where people lived
in 1985 and in 1990, immigration has noticeable effects on internal
US migration. The states and cities that get the most immigrants
are those that saw native-born non-Hispanic persons with less
than a high school education move out, and native-born non-Hispanic
persons with college degrees or more move in. Since many immigrants
are Hispanics with less than a high school education, the secondary
or internal migration associated with immigration accentuate economic
and other inequalities in states such as CA, and cities such as
Los Angeles.<BR>

<P>
These results suggest that unskilled immigrants push unskilled
natives out of immigration areas, while native &quot;elites&quot;
are attracted to immigrant areas. If such patterns continues,
Frey projects that there will be growing differences between the
states that might manifest themselves as competition similar to
central city-suburb tensions. For example, if current trends continue,
by 2020 13 mostly northern Plains states such as the Dakotas will
be at least 85 percent non-Hispanic white, while 11 states, including
the Big 4 of CA, TX, NY, and FL, will be less than 60 percent
non-Hispanic white.<BR>

<P>
The discussion emphasized that the same patterns--unskilled natives
moving out of CA, and professionals moving in--may have occurred
in the low-immigration 1960s. Second, some participants worried
that the same model was being used to explain both leaving and
entering a state--the depvar is net migration--but there may be
different forces at work. Third, several participants noted that
the model explained relatively little of the variance across states
in migration patterns.<BR>

<P>
During the afternoon panel discussion of immigration research,
Roger Waldinger (UCLA) noted that an analysis of Census data for
Los Angles for 1970, 1980, and 1990 emphasizes that there are
far more immigrants arriving at the bottom than at the top of
the job ladder, and that especially Mexicans at the bottom are
not enjoying rapid upward mobility. A fifteen chapter book on
Ethnic Los Angeles will be published in 1996. Waldinger, Roger
and Mehdi Bozorgmehr (Eds). 1996. Ethnic Los Angeles. New York:
Russell Sage.<BR>

<P>
Dowell Myers (USC) reported on his double cohort method--by age
and year of entry-- of analyzing what happened to immigrants arriving
in the seven southern CA counties after 1980. His analysis shows
that especially young immigrants make considerable economic progress
after their arrival--as measured by their total incomes--and that
some of their behavior converges rapidly to that of natives, e.g.,
they rapidly abandon buses and drive cars to work. In southern
CA, one-third of all bus riders are recent immigrants.<BR>

<P>
Myers noted that immigration is raising other issues, including
overcrowded housing. The US definition of acceptable housing was
two or less persons per room until 1960, when the definition was
change to one or less per room. However, as immigrants moved into
southern CA, overcrowding jumped, raising questions about how
aggressively cities should enforce housing codes developed during
a non-immigrant era.<BR>

<P>
George Vernez (Rand) outlined an ambitious project that is dealing
with the question of whether immigration is, on balance, a plus
or minus for CA by examining the effects of immigration on internal
migration, on wages, and on public sector finances since 1960.
These studies show that immigrants from most countries do catch
up to similar natives in average weekly earnings after 10 to 20
years, but not immigrants from the major country of origin--Mexico.
Furthermore, immigrant children tend to follow in their parents'
footsteps, meaning that the children of Asian immigrants tend
to do well in school, etc., while the children of Mexican immigrants
do not.<BR>

<P>
The Mexican lag may be even more severe if Mexicans tend to report
a more recent arrival date than they actually arrived. For example,
many Mexicans who may have arrived in the US before 1987 reported
in the 1990 Census that they arrived in 1987, the year that they
applied for legalization. It was also noted that, in the three
major industrial democracies of France, Germany, and the US, the
largest immigrant group--Algerians, Turks, and Mexicans--seem
to do &quot;worst&quot; on most integration measures.<BR>

<P>
Hans Johnson (CA PPI) reported that the institute has a number
of immigration projects underway, including an examination of
internal migration patterns, Mexican return migration, and the
effects of Prop 187 on prenatal care.<BR>
