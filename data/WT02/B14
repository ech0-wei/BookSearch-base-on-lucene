Prop. 187 Approved in California</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
California voters on November 8 voted 59 to 41 percent to approve Proposition
187, the "Save Our State'' Initiative.  Proposition 187 is an initiative
statute whose provisions remain state law unless disapproved by a two-thirds
vote of the California Legislature or by another initiative.<p>
<p>
A federal judge blocked the implementation of virtually all sections of Prop.
187 until at least December 14, citing "a balance of hardship that decidedly
tips in favor of" continuing to provide services to unauthorized immigrants.
Specifically, the judge said that the initiative may not be constitutional
because it does not provide due process, or a hearing before an individual is
denied benefits such as schooling or health care.  The judge's order prevents
California from announcing regulations implementing Prop. 187.  Only the
sections that impose penalties for making or using false documents were not
blocked.   <p>
<p>
 Prop. 187--Major Provisions<p>
<p>
Prop. 187 has five major sections.  First, it bars illegal aliens from the
state's public education systems from kindergarten through university, and
requires public educational institutions to begin verifying the legal status of
both students (effective January 1, 1995) and their parents (effective January
1, 1996).  <p>
<p>
California educational institutions today verify the residence but not the
legal status of pupils and students.  There are no tuition charges for K-12
education.  One of California's three higher education systems--the state
university system--charges resident illegal aliens lower in-state tuition,
while community colleges and UC charge them higher out-of state tuition.  <p>
<p>
Second, all providers of publicly-paid, non-emergency health care services must
verify the legal status of persons seeking services in order to be reimbursed
by the state of CA.<p>
<p>
Third, Prop. 187 requires that all persons seeking cash assistance and other
benefits verify their legal status before receiving benefits.  Fourth, all
service providers are required to report suspected illegal aliens to
California's Attorney General and to the INS, and police must determine the
legal status of persons arrested.  Fifth, the making and use of false documents
is now a state felony.<p>
<p>
Prop. 187 is a law whose sections can be implemented individually.  On November
9, Governor Wilson ordered that health services for prenatal care be stopped as
soon as possible, and that no more unauthorized aliens be enrolled in
state-reimbursed long-term health care programs (nursing home care).  <p>
<p>
The denial of public education to illegal alien children is likely to be the
most controversial section of Prop. 187 to be resolved by the courts.  The 1982
Plyler v Doe US Supreme Court decision declared that the equal protection
clause of the 14th amendment protects everyone within a state's borders,
regardless of immigration status.  However, the court split 5-4 on whether
"equal protection" for illegal alien children included the same education
available to US-citizen children.  The majority emphasized that education is
especially needed to prevent the development of an underclass; the minority
argued that the court was making social policy.<p>
<p>
Public education is the most costly service used by illegal aliens in
California--providing education for the estimated 300,000 to 400,000 illegal
alien children in California schools accounts for about half of the estimated
$3 billion annual costs of services provided to the estimated 1.7 million
illegal aliens in California [California's state budget is $40 billion
annually].<p>
<p>
Several school districts joined in suits seeking to have the
denial-of-public-education part of Prop. 187 declared unconstitutional.  This
in turn prompted protests and, in a few instances, threats to initiate recall
campaigns against public officials who vote to spend taxpayer dollars to fight
Prop. 187.  In Los Angeles, where 51 percent of the voters supported Prop. 187,
there have been threats of recall campaigns against school board members who
voted to file a lawsuit seeking to overturn Prop. 187's public school
provisions.  The State Board of Education on November 21 ordered the
preparation of emergency regulations to implement Prop. 187 in the event that
the courts lift the injunction that currently prevents its implementation.<p>
<p>
There are several what-next scenarios.  Governor Wilson and some Prop. 187
supporters argue that unauthorized aliens, unable to receive public services,
will leave California.  Prop. 187 supporters hope to sponsor similar measures
in other states--Arizona, Texas and Florida, setting off, in a Prop. 13-like
fashion, a national effort to restrict the access of unauthorized immigrants to
public services.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>Others predict that Prop. 187, plus stepped up labor law and border
enforcement, will primarily discourage additional unauthorized immigrants from
entering California.  They caution that Prop. 187 should be seen primarily as
an eligibility measure, not as a border management or labor market measure.<p>
<p>
Finally, there is the possibility that Prop. 187 will be largely a symbolic
measure, as was Prop. 63.  In 1986, three-fourths of California voters voted to
make English the state's "official language."  Prop. 63 has had little effect
on the manner in which public affairs are conducted in California.  If
immigration slows and California's economy recovers, there are some who predict
that Prop. 187 may be only symbolic.<p>

CA like anti-immigration law," Associated Press, November 28, 1994.<p>
<p>
 Prop. 187--The Campaign<p>
<p>
The Prop. 187 initiative began with a huge lead in opinion polls--it had a
37-point lead in July, and led among likely voters by 62 to 29 percent in
mid-September, 1994.  However, by early November, polls indicated that as many
likely voters opposed as supported SOS.  Most politicians and opinion leaders
argued that voters should reject Prop. 187 because it was too blunt an
instrument to deal with the complex issue of illegal immigration.  <p>
<p>
In the week before the election, Governor Wilson, who was re-elected with 55
percent of the vote, asserted that if SOS becomes law, he would require state
and local government employees to report suspected illegal aliens as required
by SOS.  California Attorney General Dan Lungren, who was also re-elected,
promised to develop emergency regulations to implement the initiative
immediately, but noted that there was no penalty for persons who do not report
suspected illegal aliens.  <p>
<p>
Wilson's campaign bought the only pro-SOS TV ads that were aired, while the
anti-SOS campaign used contributions from doctors and teachers to run anti-SOS
TV ads.  Democratic challenger Kathleen Brown ran out of money for TV ads at
the end of her campaign, and toured high school and college campuses, urging
students to work to defeat SOS.<p>
<p>
President Clinton argued against SOS.  According to Clinton, "it is not wrong
for you [Californians] to want to reduce illegal immigration.  And it is not
wrong for you to say it is a national responsibility."  Clinton said that "the
federal government should do more to help to stop illegal immigration and to
help California bear the costs of the illegal immigrants who are there," but
urged California voters to reject SOS and allow the federal government to "keep
working on what we're doing -- stiffening the border patrol, stiffening the
sanctions on employers who knowingly hire illegal immigrants, stiffening our
ability to get illegal immigrants out of the workforce, increasing our ability
to deport people who have committed crimes who are illegal immigrants."
Clinton promised that the federal government would do more to "help California,
and other states, deal with incarceration, health and education costs of
illegal immigration."<p>
<p>
Some observers believe that Clinton may have reduced his chances to carry
California in the 1996 presidential race by campaigning so vigorously against
Prop. 187.  The "white male backlash" against illegal immigration may, these
observers say, also manifest itself in attacks on affirmative action and
similar programs.  A "California Civil Rights Initiative" that would eliminate
state affirmative action programs is already being prepared.<p>
<p>
The campaign's final days were marked by large numbers of Hispanic students
walking out of high school to protest SOS .  In the opinion of many Prop. 187
opponents, these protests were counterproductive--the Mexican flags they waved
reportedly convinced many undecided voters to support Prop. 187.<p>
<p>
The closing days of the campaign were also marked by charges of hypocrisy
between US Senate candidates Feinstein and Huffington.  Both took tough stands
against illegal immigration, and both charged that the other employed an
illegal alien maid.  Feinstein hired an illegal housekeeper in the early
1980s--before it was unlawful for a US employer to knowingly hire illegal alien
workers--and Huffington hired an illegal alien nanny in the late 1980s and
early 1990s, when such hiring was unlawful.  Some Huffington supporters alleged
that illegal aliens voted for Feinstein, who was narrowly re-elected.<p>
<p>
 Prop. 187--The Vote<p>
<p>
A majority of voters in 50 of California's 58 counties supported Prop. 187--the
exceptions were eight San Francisco Bay Area counties. According to exit polls,
64 percent of whites, 57 percent of Asian-Americans, 56 percent of
African-Americans, and 31 percent of Latinos voted in favor of Prop. 187.  Of
those voting in favor of Prop. 187, 78 percent agreed that "it sends a message
that needs to be sent" and 51 percent agreed that "it will force the federal
government to face the issue."  Some 40 percent of voters in one exit poll said
that they voted primarily because Prop. 187 was on the ballot.<p>
<p>
Of those voting against the measure, 60 percent agreed with the statement that
it "doesn't solve the problem" and about 40 percent agreed that  "it would
throw children out of school" and that "it is racist/anti-Latino."<p>
<p>
California's population is 57 percent white, 25 percent Latino, nine percent
Asian-American, and seven percent African American.  However, voters on
November 8 were 75 to 80 percent white, eight to 10 percent Latino, four to
five percent Asian-American, and 10 percent African-American.<p>
<p>
In Texas, only 35 percent of that state's 1.3 million registered Hispanic
voters<p>
cast ballots.  Hispanic voters supported Democratic gubernatorial candidate Ann
Richards three to one over  Republican George W. Bush.  A study by Rhino
Information Systems concluded that the 1994 election will problably be the last
time Democrats can count on the Hispanic vote, as Hispanics are becoming more
conservative and more Republican.  Hispanic households with incomes over
$27,000 per year, for example, are more likely to vote Republican than
Democratic.  Exit polls in Texas found that Hispanics favor increased border
patrols to halt illegal immigration, but they oppose Prop. 187-like measures.
<p>
<p>
After Prop. 187-- Reactions<p>
<p>
Prop. 187 was based on the theory that changes in immigrant policy would affect
immigration policy--denying public services to unauthorized aliens would
discourage them from coming to the US.  Governor Wilson asserted that, since
public services were a magnet for at least some unauthorized aliens, denying
them services would encourage them to leave California.<p>
<p>
There were conflicting reports after November 8 about the behavior of
unauthorized immigrants.  Some hospitals and clinics reported sharply fewer
patients, and there were scattered reports that some of the estimated 300,000
to 400,000 unauthorized children in California schools were not going to
school. However, most health facilities and schools reported business as usual.
<p>
<p>
In one widely-reported case, illegal alien parents reportedly did not seek
medical care for their 12-year old son for fear of deportation to Mexico.  He
subsequently died.  Many service providers printed up materials in their
clients' language explaining that nothing had changed, and that patients and
students would not be asked to prove legal status before they received
services.  <p>
<p>
There were also numerous workshops on campuses, in churches, and in ethnic
communities in which speakers decried the passage of Prop. 187 and urged
opponents to get politically involved.  Some speakers denounced the "racism"
that, they asserted, motivated the vote, and some asserted that unauthorized
immigrants report "feeling hatred" in the streets.  <p>
<p>
Activists in several other states threatened to boycott California in
retaliation for the approval of Prop. 187.  Denver's mayor urged city residents
to boycott California, and the 110,000 member League of United Latin American
Citizens said that most of its December conference would be devoted to planning
a California boycott.  Several other Hispanic organizations announced that they
would not hold conventions in California, and some Hispanic leaders urged a
boycott of Disneyland to send a signal of their dissatisfaction with the
California vote.<p>
<p>
Denying public services to unauthorized aliens may not be easy because many
California households include persons with different legal statuses.  In
so-called "mixed families,"  family members include US citizens, legal
immigrants, and unauthorized persons.  Some fear that, if a US citizen or legal
immigrant seeks services to which they are entitled, they may expose an
unauthorized family member to immigration authorities.  To prevent such
detection, many public employees pledged not to comply with Prop. 187's
verification requirements, which have not yet gone into effect.<p>
<p>
Prominent Republicans scrapped over immigration.  Former cabinet secretaries
Bill Bennett and Jack Kemp attacked California Governor Wilson for supporting
Prop. 187.  They argued that immigrants are "natural Republicans" who support
low taxes and family values, and that Wilson risks turning the Republican party
into a party of protectionism and xenophobia.  According to Bennett, "its
assimilation, stupid"--meaning that the major problem is not the number or type
of immigrant entering the US.  Instead, Bennett argues that fears that
newcomers will not integrate into American society result from "too many"
programs such as bilingual education that, he argues, promotes
multiculturalism.<p>
<p>
Governor Wilson responded that the Republicans should hew to a law and order
line, and emphasize the sharp distinction between legal and illegal immigrants.
According to Wilson, the U.S. Border Patrol has a "Mission Impossible" task
trying to keep people from entering the US illegally, but the federal
government guarantees services and benefits "to everyone who succeeds in
evading the Border Patrol."<p>
<p>
Incoming House of Representatives Speaker Gingrich assured Wilson that he
believes the federal government should either fully reimburse states for the
costs they incur to provide services to illegal aliens, or eliminate the
requirement that the states provide services to them.<p>
<p>
The conservative magazine National Review weighed in on the side of Wilson,
asserting that the economic benefits of immigration are small, and that
immigration threatens national identity because it promotes multiculturalism
and the welfare state.<p>

<p>
After Prop. 187--Labor Law Enforcement<p>
<p>
In campaigning against SOS, the Clinton Administration asserted that policy
initiatives already underway would prove more effective at curbing illegal
immigration.  For example, on November 2, Labor Secretary Robert Reich asserted
that a Department of Labor crackdown against the employers of illegal aliens
would curb illegal immigration by denying them jobs.<p>
<p>
Reich announced that a Georgia onion grower and the farm labor contractor that
brought immigrant workers to his farm have been assessed a penalty of $1.2
million, including $675,000 in back wages, for paying farmworkers less than the
minimum wage and violating other farm labor protection laws.  According to
Reich, if US employers are unable to pay less than minimum wages, US workers
are more likely to be attracted to jobs now filled by illegal aliens.<p>
<p>
According to Reich, employers of illegal aliens also violate other laws, so
that penalizing employers who hire illegal aliens in order to pay below minimum
wages will help to curb illegal immigration.  In a sweep of 44 southern
California garment shops, 41, or 95 percent, were found to be violating federal
labor laws, and 40 percent of the workers in these shops were illegal aliens.
In 1993, DOL ordered employers to pay $3.1 million to underpaid workers, up 30
percent from 1992.<p>
<p>
Labor law enforcement has traditionally depended on complaints, because it is
too expensive to randomly check on the six million employers in the US and the
750,000 employers in California.  Some opponents of Prop. 187 argue that,
instead of putting more resources into verifying the legal status of applicants
for public services, we should put more effort into enforcing labor laws--if
employers could not "exploit" illegal alien workers, this argument runs,
illegal aliens would be less likely to be hired and thus less likely to come to
the US.   <p>

Scheer, "Instead of 187:  Enforcement of Labor Laws,"  Los Angeles Times,
November 20, 1994.  <p>
<p>
After Prop. 187--Hispanic Political Activism<p>
<p>
Hispanics are about 28 percent of California's 32 million people, but they are
just 15 percent of the state's eligible voters, and they cast only eight to
nine percent of the November 8 ballots.  Many are too young to vote, many
adults are not US citizens, and many Hispanic US citizens do not vote.  <p>
<p>
About 2.7 million illegal aliens were legalized in 1987-88 and, after a period
of temporary residence, most became legal immigrants after October 1988.  These
immigrants became eligible to become US citizens in October 1993.  As a result
of the Prop. 187 campaign, many school districts that offer citizenship classes
expect enrollment to jump--in the case of the Los Angeles School District, from
an average 500 to 25,000 by January 1995.  About 90,000 immigrants became US
citizens in Los Angeles in 1994, double the 1993 level--315,000 aliens became
naturalized US citizens in 1993.<p>
<p>
Hispanic high school and college students were especially active in opposing
SOS, walking out of class frequently in late October and early November.
Several commentators predicted that the activism born of opposition to SOS
would be a defining moment for Hispanics, turning them into a political force
in the same way that the Civil Rights movement of the 1960s encouraged Blacks
to participate in the political process.<p>
<p>
 After Prop. 187--US-Mexican Relations<p>
<p>
Many commentators were surprised by the active opposition of the Mexican
government to Prop. 187 , and the extensive coverage of the campaign for and
against Prop. 187 in the Mexican media.  In his final state-of-the-nation
address, Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari asserted that  "Mexico
affirms rejection of this xenophobic campaign, and will continue to act in
defense of the labor and human rights of our migrant workers,"  although he
acknowledged that Mexico could not hope to use economic sanctions against the
US or California to protest the approval of Prop. 187.  <p>
<p>
Ernesto Zedillo, who becomes Mexico's President on December 1, asserted during
his November trip to Washington, DC that Mexico "cannot object to legitimate
enforcement of US laws," but Mexico objects to "enforcement [that] might lead
to deprivation or violation of basic human rights.... [including] education and
health care."   The Mexican government promised to contribute attorneys and
funds to fight Proposition 187 in US courts. <p>
<p>
A week after SOS was enacted, President Salinas called on the US to discuss a
bilateral agreement that would permit Mexicans to work legally in the US under
a guestworker program. According to Salinas, the movement of Mexican workers to
the US "is inevitable, and it is better to order and regulate it than to
confront it with administrative measures that are not going to stop it because
the force of the economies is greater."  Governor Wilson, in a widely reported
November 18 speech to the Heritage Foundation, announced his support for a
program to import Mexican guestworkers.<p>
<p>
Knowledgeable US observers are skeptical, doubting that the Zedillo
Administration will make the enactment of what would be a controversial
guestworker program a top priority.  Indeed, some advise the Mexican government
that any guestworker proposal in the current US political climate could be
counterproductive.  The Mexican government does not want to have the US close
the safety valve on which several million of its citizens depend.  Mexico sees
no significant lessening of emigration pressures during the 1990s.<p>
<p>
The scenario for Mexico requesting and the US negotiating a guestworker program
in 1995 runs something like this.  Labor shortages develop, perhaps in the May
1995 Oregon strawberry harvest.  The INS meanwhile, concludes that Operation
Gatekeeper has succeeded in reducing the influx of illegal aliens, and
discusses ways to make legal border crossings easier.  US employers argue that
the current H-2 programs under which foreign workers may be imported to the US
in the event of labor shortages is too inflexible, and Mexico asks for a
bilateral program that recognizes its proximity and the tradition of US
employers hiring Mexican workers.<p>
<p>
In such a scenario, the discussion could very quickly shift from whether there
should be a guestworker program with Mexico to what kind of program.  Given
Prop. 187, it is already clear that any guestworkers would have little access
to US public services while here, and that a significant portion of their wages
are likely to be withheld to encourage their return. <p>
<p>
Several newspapers have suggested that the guestworker idea proposed by Salinas
would be the best way to engage in "immigration damage control."  The
Sacramento Bee, for example, editorialized on November 16, 1994 that a
guestworker program could protect Mexican workers who are temporarily in the US
and prove that California welcomes foreign workers who "play by the rules."<p>
<p>
A few days before the California election, protesters vandalized a McDonalds'
restaurant in Mexico City to protest the passage of Prop. 187.  California
exports goods and services worth about $7 billion annually to Mexico, and
several Mexicans urged a boycott of Disneyland to "send a message" to
California.  Some businessmen fear that Mexico may shun California firms when
it requests bids for projects to upgrade Mexico's infrastructure.<p>
<p>
Mexicans continue to be apprehended attempting entry into the US, about 700 per
night in San Diego.  Deputy Foreign Minister Rozenthal predicted that, as North
America integrates economically under NAFTA, "immigration is going to be the
No. 1 issue between the US and Mexico for the next several years."  <p>
<p>
Mexico's economy is expected to grow by 3.5 percent in 1994, and US-Mexico
trade is booming, up about 20 percent in 1994.   US airlines in 1993 flew more
passengers to Latin America--15.8 million--than to Europe--15.6 million--or
across the Pacific--13.6 million.<p>
<p>
Between January and October 1994, Mexico deported 60,000 illegal aliens who
entered the country through its southern border.<p>
<p>
Immigration is likely to be a central issue during December's Summit of the
Americas in Miami.  Leaders of several Central American countries are expected
to tell President Clinton that their economies must grow faster in order to
stem the flow of illegal immigrants to the north.  Central American leaders
have begun an intensive lobbying effort to prevent the return of their citizens
after the passage of Prop. 187 and the threat of not renewing temporary
protected status for El Salvadorans(see related story on El Salvador). <p>

<a name="RTFToC3">Immigration
and Welfare Reform</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
The combination of Prop. 187 in California and the return to power of
Republicans in Congress has made immigration a national issue.  Most observers
expect that immigration legislation will be enacted in 1995, so that
politicians running for re-election in 1996 can say that they "did something"
about immigration.  Most predications are that new efforts will be made to
reduce illegal immigration, and that more restrictions will be placed on the
availability of social services to legal and illegal immigrants.<p>
<p>
Immigration Proposals<p>
<p>
There were numerous immigration proposals introduced in Congress in 1993, but
Democrats reportedly fearful that "extreme" measures might be approved
allegedly failed to hold hearings or permit votes on them.  Among the proposals
being discussed are Governor Wilson's call to either eliminate or provide funds
for federal requirements that services be provided to illegal aliens, more
funds for the Border Patrol, and speedier deportations of especially criminal
aliens.  <p>
<p>
There may also be a battle over the number of legal immigrants admitted to the
US.  IMMACT in 1990 raised the number of legal immigrants expected annually
from about 500,000 to 800,000.  Senator Simpson (R-WY) has introduced
legislation to reduce the number of legal entries, and FAIR has called for a
"moratorium" on legal immigration.<p>
<p>
When Congress reconvenes in January, Representative Lamar Smith (R-TX) and
Senator Alan Simpson (R-WY) are expected to chair the immigration
subcommittees.  Both are expected to introduce legislation aimed at reducing
illegal immigration.<p>
<p>
Welfare Proposals<p>
<p>
House Republicans on November 21 introduced a proposal to consolidate a number
of federal social service program and cap spending on such programs, so that
those eligible may not get services if funds run out.  Three of the major
programs to be consolidated are Food Stamps, which spent $24 billion to assist
27.3 million people in 1993, WIC, which spent $3.1 billion to assist 6.2
million people, and school lunch programs, which spent $4.5 billion to provide
lunches for 25 million pupils every day.<p>
<p>
Republicans are also proposing changes in the Aid to Families with Dependent
Children (AFDC) program, which denies benefits to unauthorized aliens, but not
their US-born and thus US-citizen children.  About five million
households--most headed by single mothers--received about $14 billion in
federal and $12 billion in state funds in 1994.<p>
<p>
The Republican proposal, known as the Personal Responsibility Act, would also
deny most federally-funded assistance to illegal aliens, and introduce new
restrictions on the access of legal aliens to social services.  Illegal aliens
would be barred from 60 federal programs--most health programs, including
migrant health center services, and from public housing, job training, and
homeless service programs.<p>
<p>
Aliens would continue to be eligible for emergency health services regardless
of their legal status, and refugees would continue to be eligible for federal
service programs.  However, legal immigrants would in many cases be ineligible
for services for at least five years after their entry into the US. <p>
<p>
Like many other federal assistance programs, spending on and participation in
the Food Stamp program exploded over the past two decades--in 1973, $2 billion
was spent to assist 12 million people.  About 69 percent of those believed
eligible for Food Stamps in 1992 participated--many of the elderly and working
poor who are eligible do not apply for Food Stamps.  To encourage eligible poor
persons to apply for Food Stamps, USDA, which administers the program, has made
grants to community organizations so that they can help people apply.<p>
<p>
Food Stamps are government coupons that are used like cash to buy groceries.
Individuals and families whose monthly incomes are below the poverty
line--about $1,600 for a family of four, or $800 for an individual, apply at
local welfare offices.  Applications are 10 to 40 pages long, depending on the
state and, after approval, coupons worth $1, $5, or $10 are distributed for
most types of food and drink, including basic foods as well as soft drinks and
candy, but not alcohol or cigarettes.  Applicants are fingerprinted, issued an
identification card, and required to file monthly reports on their incomes and
assets--having a car worth $4,550 or more disqualifies a person for Food
Stamps.  <p>
<p>
Over half of the recipients on whose behalf coupons are issued are children,
and another seven percent were persons 60 and older.  Food Stamps worth, on
average, $68 per person per month, or $170 per household, accounted for
one-fourth of a typical recipient's income.<p>
<p>
Most recipients receive Food Stamps for about seven months, but many reapply
within one year.  Some believe that the sharp drop in earnings for high-school
dropouts has contributed to the increased usage of Food Stamps--the real
earnings of male high-school dropouts fell from $22,858 in 1967 to $14,439 in
1989.  Others emphasize the rise in female-headed households.<p>

<a name="RTFToC4">Operation
Gatekeeper in San Diego</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
Operation Gatekeeper, initiated on October 1, 1994, has reduced the number of
aliens apprehended by 20 percent, to 25,000 in its first month.  The US Border
Patrol has assigned 200 additional agents to guard the 14 miles of US-Mexico
border south of San Diego, establishing three lines of agents to make it more
difficult for aliens seeking to enter the US illegally to avoid capture. <p>
<p>
But Gatekeeper had two other side effects--more aliens attempted to enter the
US illegally further east, and more aliens attempted entry with false
documents.  Apprehensions in inland sectors, such as Brown Field, rose 33
percent to 200 daily, and there was almost a 100-percent increase in the number
of aliens attempting to use false documents and enter through the legal port of
entry.  <p>
<p>
After illegal aliens are apprehended, they are fingerprinted and photographed,
held for a few hours, and then returned to Mexico.  Solo males, the majority of
those apprehended, are often taken 50 to 100 miles east of San Diego to make it
harder for them to return to Tijuana and attempt re-entry.<p>
<p>
In mid-November, the INS was apprehending about 700 aliens daily, down about 30
percent from earlier levels. The recidivist rate--the percentage of aliens who
had been apprehended previously--increased significantly, from less than 10
percent in early October to 20 to 30 percent by the end of November.  In order
to assess the effectiveness of Gatekeeper, the INS took 200 agents from the
border and re-opened the San Clemente checkpoint, which is 65 miles north of
the Mexican border.  <b></b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>As apprehensions drop in El Paso, Texas and San Diego, more aliens are
attempting entry in other areas, especially Arizona, ''California's side door,"
in the words of US Attorney General Reno.  The Border Patrol plans to launch
Operation Safeguard in Arizona, building fences and sending more agents to
apprehend aliens attempting entry.  <p>
<p>
In another article critical of the INS, a New York Times reporter took a day
cruise from Fort Lauderdale to Bermuda to demonstrate how easy it is for
illegal aliens to slip into the US.  The INS reportedly knows that such cruises
are being used to smuggle aliens and drugs into the US, but does not change its
inspection procedures for fear that cruise operations would be impeded.  Under
these procedures, non-US citizens are asked to come to a place on the ship as
it returns to the US for inspection, but there is no search for those who do
not present themselves for inspection. <p>

<p>
The Clinton Administration insisted in August, 1994 that the 30,000 Cubans and
20,000 Haitians who had left their countries in small boats and were held at
the US Naval base in Guantanamo, Cuba would  have to return to their homelands
in order to enter the US.  The intent was to discourage Cubans and Haitians
from arriving in southern Florida to request asylum.  <p>
<p>
Most of the Haitians by mid-November had returned to Haiti, but 30,000 Cubans
remain in Guantanamo.  Some want to return to Cuba, but US lawyers in Florida
have sued the federal government to prevent their return until lawyers have an
opportunity to advise them of their rights.  On November 3, a federal Court of
Appeals overturned a lower court's injunction and allowed the US to begin
returning to Cuba some of the 24,000 Cubans at the US Naval Base in Guantanamo
Bay.  Another 8,000 Cubans are being detained in Panama.  <p>
<p>
In defiance of the ban on coming directly from Guantanamo to the US, a federal
court in October 1994 permitted unaccompanied children under 18 and families
with such children to be brought from Guantanamo to the US.  On November 15,
the administration announced that it was likely to allow the 8,000 Cubans in
Guantanamo with children to come directly to the US rather than continue to
fight against the judge's order, citing the education needs of the children.
Cubans are eligible for 25,000 permanent immigrant visas in FY95; the
additional slots for children may raise the total to 30,000.<p>
<p>
On November 22, 1994, a federal judge applied this same reasoning to Haitian
children in Guantanamo, ordering that the 231 unaccompanied Haitian children
under 18 in Guantanamo be brought to the US for humanitarian reasons.  The
judge also ruled that legal counsel must be provided to all refugees who
request it in writing, and the names of all the Haitians still held in
Guantanamo must be given to refugee advocates. <p>

<a name="RTFToC6">End
of TPS for Salvadorans?</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
The Clinton Administration is considering allowing Temporary Protected Status
to expire for the 187,000 El Salvadorans who left the country for the US during
its 1980s civil war.  The TPS status of the Salvadorans was established in
IMMACT in 1990, and extended several times since then.  It is scheduled to
expire on December 31, 1994.  <p>
<p>
The Salvadoran government and US activists are pressuring the Clinton
Administration to extend TPS again.  Experts believe that the passage of Prop.
187 may influence the Clinton Administration's decision on another extension.
<p>
<p>
There may be as many as 400,000 Salvadorans in the Los Angeles area, and 1
million Salvadorans in the US.  Many would not be affected by the expiration of
TPS.  Salvadorans in the US remit $1 billion annually to El Salvador, the
country's number one source of foreign exchange.  <p>
<p>
If TPS is not extended, some Salvadorans are expected to return voluntarily,
while others are expected to apply for political asylum.  There is a backlog of
500,000 political asylum cases, which means that Salvadorans requesting asylum
would probably be given permission to work throughout the application process,
which could take several years.  Some Salvadorans may apply for permanent
residence status if they have been in the US for seven years and their
deportation would cause severe hardship to them or to a family member who is a
permanent resident or an American citizen. <p>

<a name="RTFToC7">Canada
Reduces Immigration</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
Canada announced on November 1 that it will reduce legal immigration from
250,000 in 1994 to between 190,000 and 215,000 from 1995 to 2000.  This
reduction broke a promise made in the 1993 campaign to maintain immigration at
one percent of the population, which would mean 290,000 immigrants annually.
The impetus behind the immigration policy changes is an effort by the
government to encourage immigrants "who (have) the skills and qualities to
establish themselves quickly... While limiting the number of immigrants that
are likely to depend upon government support." <p>
<p>
Under the new plan, 55 percent of all immigrants will be admitted in economic
categories, and 44 percent in family categories, and knowledge of English or
French will play a greater role in immigrant selection.  The stress on language
skills reportedly reflects governmental concern over the costs of teaching the
44 percent of all immigrants who do not speak English or French.  <p>
<p>
Canada is also considering requiring persons who sponsor immigrants to post a
bond or guarantee that the immigrants will not need public assistance after
their arrival.  About one in seven immigrants admitted under the family
categories is on welfare, at an annual cost of C$ 700 million.  Under the
previous rules,  immediate relatives of legal residents gained automatic
entrance.  The new regulations require that these relatives apply on their own
to gain legal status in Canada--thereby reducing the number of immigrants
admitted under the family classification.  <p>
<p>
Canada also suspended its investor-immigrant program" under which persons who
invest at least C$ 250,000 in Canada for five years can become immigrants while
reported abuses--investors withdrawing their money as soon as they receive
immigrant status--are investigated.<p>
<p>
Canada has recently increased immigration levels sharply, from 84,300 in 1985
to 245,800 in 1993.  In a 1993 poll, 47 percent of the respondents thought that
Canada was accepting too many immigrants, and one-third agreed with the
statement that immigrants take "too many" jobs away from Canadians.  The Reform
Party has called for no more than 150,000 immigrants annually.<p>
<p>
Members of Vancouver's Chinese community charge that the new immigration policy
is unfair.  Their concern is primarily with the new asylum/refugee
guidelines--claimants are required to have applied for status and resided in
Canada for a minimum of three years, plus present considerable documentation.
<p>
<p>
Currently, 4,000 Chinese have applied for refugee status in Canada-- as many as
2,800 may be sent home under the new policy.  The chairman of the Mainland
China Refugee Organization in Vancouver reports that of the 4,000, 92 percent
have found jobs and less than five percent receive public assistance, contrary
to the common public perception that Chinese refugees place a burden on
Canada's social services. <p>
<p>
The Canadian immigration policy changes were reported extensively in Asia.
Hong Kong is the leading country of origin, accounting for 10 to 15 percent of
all Canadian immigrants, followed by India and Taiwan.<p>

Alien Smuggling to US</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
Alien smugglers have abandoned efforts to bring Chinese aliens illegally to the
US in ships, but they have stepped up their efforts to get them to US Caribbean
islands such as Puerto Rico, from which the Chinese can take domestic flights
to the US.  According to the INS, Chinese from Fujian in southeast China are
flown with many intermediate stops to the Dominican Republic, taken by small
boat across the 100 mile Mona Passage to Puerto Rico, and then flown to New
York City on domestic or internal US flights.<p>
<p>
The smuggling of Chinese is qualitatively different from the more common
smuggling of Mexican aliens into the US.  The Chinese are smuggled in groups of
up to 300, and they pay $20,000 to $30,000 each, making each "load" worth up to
$1 million.  Mexicans, by contrast, are more often smuggled in vans that hold
up to 20 people and, at $300 per alien, a van "load" can be worth $6,000.  In
1993, about 2,500 Chinese were apprehended trying to enter the US illegally.<p>
<p>
At an International Organization for Migration conference in Geneva this month,
70 nations discussed alien smuggling.  An INS associate commissioner for the
INS reported that cooperation between China and the US in tracking smuggling
gangs has meant that since June, not one ship has been detected trying to
smuggle Chinese immigrants to the US. <p>

At the end of 1993, there were 6.9 million foreigners in Germany, making
foreigners 8.5 percent of the population. Almost all--97 percent--lived in the
former West Germany, and about two million were refugees and asylum seekers.<p>
<p>
About 22 percent of these foreigners are from other EU member nations, 27
percent are Turks, and 14 percent are from the ex-Yugoslavia.  About 13 percent
of the 700,000 births in Germany in 1993 were to foreigners; the children take
the nationality of their parents.<p>
<p>
Chancellor Kohl's government, which was re-elected on November 15 with one vote
to spare, announced a nine-point program to guide the country during the next
four years.  The program was worked out with coalition-member FDP (Free
Democratic Party). A number of items were shelved during the talks to avoid
controversy, including dual citizenship for adult foreigners.  The program did
pledge to work for a new "children's nationality" with full citizenship rights
for children born in Germany of at least one foreign parent who have lived in
Germany for at least 10 years.<p>
<p>
The head of the Federal Office for Foreigners' Issues, Cornelia
Schmalz-Jacobsen, wants children of foreigners born in Germany to have dual
citizenship from birth to age 18, at which time they could choose their
nationality.  Schmalz-Jacobsen said that Kohl's proposals for children's
nationality would be "impossible to administer,"  because of the difficulty of
determining how long a person had lived in Germany. <p>

Germans also elected the first Parliament member of Turkish origin.  Cem
Oezdemir, 28, is a social worker and a member of the Green Party born of
Turkish parents in Germany, and naturalized as a German citizen in 1984.  His

campaign for the liberalization of Germany's naturalization laws, the
introduction of dual citizenship, and beefed up anti-discrimination laws.  <p>

Bosnian families fleeing the civil war in their own country have in some cases
been physically separated by European governments intent on limiting
immigration.  In most European countries, fewer than 10 percent of those
seeking asylum are recognized as refugees, versus about 20 percent in the US.
<p>
<p>
In a profile of a Bosnian family that was fortunate enough to have relatives
settled in Switzerland, the wife and children got safe haven there, but the
husband arrived in the UK, where the British refused to permit the family to
unite.  The family eventually reunited in Switzerland, where they live in
government-supplied housing and have temporary visas.<p>
<p>
In Britain, about 20 Bosnians secured Croatian passports in order to flee the
war.  Though Bosnian by birth, the British Home Office has told them that since
they hold Croatian passports, they must return to that country.  Last year, the
Croatian government was providing passports to anyone who could prove that they
were Christian, and many Bosnians obtained Croatian passports to escape the
civil war.  <p>
<p>
There are an estimated 8,000 people from the former Yugoslavia in Britain, and
370 of their applications for political asylum have been processed.  Five
persons were awarded refugee status and 255 denied.  The rest have been given a
year's leave to remain in Britain. <p>
<p>
With Bosnia likely to be carved into a mosaic of fiefdoms separated by
ethnicity and religion, many of the Bosnians currently "tolerated" in Western
Europe will find their homes in "hostile" territory.  They will then face the
choice of continuing to live--not always welcomed--in Western Europe, or
returning to perhaps new areas within their former countries to rebuild.<p>

According to the Russian Federal Migration Service, there are over two million

Russia will return in the next two years.  <p>

have left potential refugees stranded in Russia.  <p>

Refugees in Russia receive little assistance from the UNHCR or FMS.  The claims

Workers in Japan</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
The Japanese Labor Ministry released a report on the legal half of the
estimated 600,000 foreign workers in the country.  In the year ending June 1,
1994, the number of foreign workers hired directly by Japanese manufacturers
fell, but the number of manufacturers hiring foreign workers increased 10-fold,
from 1,300 to 13,000.  The number of foreign workers hired in construction,
transport, and services rose.<p>
<p>
Based on a survey of 14,200 companies with 130,000 foreign workers--of whom 28
percent were hired through labor contractors--the ministry reported that the
number of foreign workers employed legally in manufacturing fell by seven
percent between June, 1993 and June, 1994.  The number of foreign workers hired
by construction firms rose by 17 percent, by transport firms 10 percent, and by
service firms four percent.<p>
<p>
Large companies shed foreign workers, while small firms added foreign workers.
In corporations with more than 1,000 employees, the number of foreign workers
dropped 24, but the number of foreign workers rose by 18 percent at companies
with five to 29 employees.<p>
<p>
Of the 130,000 foreign workers reported by these employers, 60 percent were
Central and South Americans, many of whom were of Japanese descent.  Another 18
percent each were East Asians and North Americans.<p>
<p>
Chinese living illegally in Japan have apparently become sophisticated forgers
of the immigration stamps needed for legal ID cards.  For 20,000 to 60,000 yen
(US$ 200 to $600), false ID cards can be purchased.  It is common for forgers
to stamp on the alien's tourist visa "Zairyu Kikan Shinseichu" (extension under
application), which is plausible given the backlog at Japan's Immigration
Bureau. .<p>
There is also a lively business of "renting" valid passports, on which pictures
are changed.  Illegal "boat people" from China's Fujian province who arrive
without papers are believed to be the main buyers of false documents.<p>
<p>
Police arrested 13 Peruvians in northern Japan in November for overstaying
their tourist visas by one-half to almost three years.  All were employed by
Japanese firms that manufacture electrical equipment.<p>
<p>
In a new book, Japan's 'Guestworkers:' Issues and Public Policies, published by
the University of Tokyo Press, author Haruo Shimada says that Japan should
accept the need for foreign workers and enact labor laws that better protect
them.  According to Shimada, " large numbers of foreign workers and their
families are already in the country and have begun to settle on a permanent
basis." <p>
<p>
Shimada reports that in 1992, 110,000 foreigners entered Japan to work, and
that an average 85,000 were in the Japanese workforce.  In addition, there were
43,000 trainees, plus 27,000 language students who are allowed to work part
time.  About 149,000 Latin Americans of Japanese descent entered Japan.  There
are also about 300,000 foreigners who entered Japan as tourists, overstayed
their visas, and went to work.<p>

and the Philippines and Malaysia have agreed to issue border crossing cards to
Filipinos in the area.<p>
<p>
In the Philippines, it was announced that the government was establishing a new
agency to formulate a policy on overseas contract workers (OCWs).  President
Ramos has asked the Departments of Foreign Affairs and labor to develop a<p>
plan to reduce the deployment of unskilled workers, such as maids.<p>
<p>
In Hong Kong, the 20 Filipino churches are being asked to investigate the
working conditions of maids.  Maids often pay 35,000 to 40,000 pesos to
employment agencies, who often hold their passports and work permits until
their "loan" is paid off.  If the maid finds herself in an abusive situation,
she is unable to get help from the agency holding the loan, and she may find it
hard to obtain a new job within the two-week period allowed by Hong Kong
authorities for aliens to be jobless in the territory. <p>
<p>
Malaysia's labor shortages are reportedly beginning to affect its
competitiveness.  The labor shortage is attributed to the Malaysian
government's slowing the influx of foreign workers.  The most severe labor
shortages are in the major export and growth industries, such as oleochemicals,
machinery and engineering, textiles, electronics and electrical, plastics,
information technology, wood and chemicals.  <p>
<p>
A Malaysian government freeze on foreign workers early in 1994 came at a time
that the manufacturing sector was experiencing a shortage of local workers.
The government is trying to encourage the private sector to move away from
labor-intensive production in favor of higher value-added industries. <p>

<h2>
Education and Migration in Asia</a></h2>
There are fears throughout Asia that rapid economic growth is leaving them
short of educated manpower--in Thailand, for example, there are projections
that in the year 2000, the country will need 28,000 science and engineering
graduates annually, and produce only 14,000.<p>
<p>
It should be easy to get more graduates in a region in which there is respect
for education and a belief that education is the ticket to a secure economic
future produce more graduates.  Singapore provides an example of a country
that, in 1991, spent $322 per person on higher education, and developed several
world-class research institutes.  The key is reportedly not the people, many of
whom were trained and employed in top research labs in North American and
Western Europe, but rather the infrastructure to support research efforts in
Asia.<p>
<p>
However, there is often a tension between the needs of research and politics.
Higher education in China provides an example.  China has 124 million primary
school pupils, but only 40 percent pass the test that enables them to go to
junior high school despite often intense parental efforts to give their
children advantages in the competition to move up to the next level of
education.  <p>
<p>
About one in eight Chinese pupils goes to high school, and only three or four
percent pass entrance exams to win one of the 2.5 million places in Chinese
universities.  In 1992, Chinese educational spending was equivalent to about
three percent of GDP, half the level of Malaysia.  Many Chinese schools
strapped for money are imposing tuitions of $100 to $200, equivalent to half an
urban worker's annual salary.  However, 80 percent of all China's professors
are over 55, suggesting a hiring challenge.<p>

Immigration Advice on Internet</a></h2>
The Canadian immigration office in Hong Kong attracted 650 immigration
applications on one day after it was announced that the number of immigrants to
be accepted in Canada in 1995 would be reduced from the current level of
250,000 to between 190,000 and 215,000.  It was feared that increasing the
emphasis on economic skills and knowledge of English or French would reduce the
chances of Hong Kong residents to migrate there.  <p>
<p>
Canada is also considering a separate category and quota for parents and
grandparents, and imposing a legally enforceable bond on persons who sponsor
immigrants.<p>
<p>
In Hong Kong, the Canadian government has established a bulletin board on the
Internet ''misc. immigration. canada'' to provide advice on how to migrate to
Canada.  Canada granted about 31,000 immigration visas to Hong Kong residents
in 1993, and they were 21 percent of all immigrants to Canada in July 1994.<p>

<a name="RTFToC18">Citizenship
and Islam in Australia</a></h2>
Using the slogan--Australian Citizenship - Welcome to Our Family-- Australian
Prime Minister Paul Keating on November 4 launched a campaign to encourage the
1.1 million eligible immigrants--57 percent from the United Kingdom and New
Zealand-- to become Australian citizens.  About 120,000 immigrants became
Australian citizens in 1993.<p>
<p>
To become an Australian citizen, persons need to have lived two years of the
past five years in Australia, including 12 months' residence during the 24
months before applying.  Australia permits dual citizenship only if the country
of birth allows dual citizenship, as in the case of Irish or Italian
immigrants.  About 40 percent of all Australians were born abroad or had
parents who were not born in Australia.  <p>
In early November, Australia administered an English language test to 7,000
aliens requesting refugee status in the country; those who pass the test may be
able to immigrate under economic categories.  On November 1, 1993, Australia
granted permanent residence status to the 19,000 Chinese who were in the
country when the Beijing massacre occurred on June 4, 1989.  Another 9000
spouses and children later joined them in Australia.<p>
<p>
On November 1, 1993,&nbsp;there were 20,000 applicants for asylum in Australia,
and Australia created a new category of permanent resident.  The intent was to
deal with remaining Chinese students and dependents and foreign students who
paid tuition to get to Australia, and then went to work and overstayed their
visas.  Many of those required to take the test protested, but the government
responded that they came to Australia in the first place to learn English.<p>
<p>
There are 147,507 Muslims from 67 countries--led by Lebanon and Turkey--in
Australia.  Most are under 25, and one-third were born in Australia.  Half live
in Sydney, and another one-third live in Melbourne.  The number of Muslims in
Australia almost doubled between 1981 and 1991, and Australia now has 57
mosques.<p>
<p>
Almost half of the Muslims interviewed in one study complained of
discrimination, especially women wearing the hijab, or head covering, while
trying to get jobs.  A Racial Hatred Bill is expected to be introduced in
Canberra to create an agency to hear complaints of public behavior against
persons because of their race, color or ethnic origin.<p>

Controlling Illegal Immigration:  A Global Perspective.  Available from
Stanford University Press, Stanford, California, 94305.   Paperback and
Hardbound. <p>
<p>
This book provides comparative perspectives on how nine industrialized
countries have tried to deal with illegal immigration and refugee flows.  The
American authors and their generally native commentators explore two
hypotheses:  the convergence hypothesis that the industrial countries that are
today net immigration areas use increasingly similar policy <u>instruments</u>
to regulate immigration, and the gap hypothesis, which asserts that the
<u>gap</u> between the immigration policy goals and outcomes is growing in all
industrial countries.  The goals-outcomes gap helps to explain the common
anti-immigrant mood.  <p>
<p>
While the authors agree that there is a growing gap between immigration goals
and outcomes in each country, they do not necessarily agree on the most
important factors that cause it.  Several authors emphasize the importance of
demand-pull factors--the idea that, even in periods of high unemployment, there
are jobs to be filled by unskilled immigrants, and employers are able to
frustrate effective controls meant to keep out such immigrants.  Other authors
focus on supply-push pressures that encourage migrants to leave rural Mexico,
Turkey, and other sending countries; they see rising emigration pressures, plus
the networks or bridges that have made it ever easier for migrants to cross
borders, obtain jobs, and stay, as the primary determinants of unwanted
migration.<p>
<p>
There is little disagreement that the industrialized countries that embraced in
the 1950s and 1960s the notion that they could borrow labor temporarily from
their poorer neighbors did not appreciate the fact that what was once seen as
simple economic transaction has become a complex socio-political issue, raising
fundamental questions, such as who are we and whom do we invite to join our
nation-state?  The industrial nations generally failed at least once in their
quest for control over illegal immigration, and they now stand on the threshold
of an era in which streams of immigration have the potential to become less
manageable rivers of people.  <p>
<p>
Politicians are responding to the anti-immigrant moods of most industrial
countries by discussing the importance of dealing with the root causes of
unwanted immigration, and then, in the familiar mode of the man with the hammer
who perceives all problems to be nails, these mostly lawyers who extended
rights to citizens and aliens are beginning to roll them back in an effort to
reassert control over immigration.  These rights rollbacks are having at least
initial successes:  asylum applications are down sharply in Germany in 1994
compared to 1993, and the US "Hold-the-Line" approach of flooding the border
with border control agents appears to keep out unauthorized short-distance
migrants.  However, such control measures have in the past proven to have their
desired effects for only a short time, so that, viewed over a longer time
horizon, they appear to be only symbolic steps designed to appease
anti-immigrant sentiment.<p>
<p>
This book explains how the immigration problem evolved in the various
industrial countries, how it is defined today, and how migration streams are
likely to evolve.  It does not prescribe what the countries studied should do,
but the theme running through many of the chapters is that no country is
satisfied with its current immigration control policies.  More telling,
perhaps, is that there seems to be no success story that industrial countries
can adapt to their own situations, as in environmental or urban planning or in
labor market policies.  Rather than prescribing the optimal policies, this book
illustrates the consequences of alternative policy paths.<p>

<p>
About 10 million Americans are self employed, and about 10 million US workers
were born in another country.  Rates of self-employment vary  by country of
origin--among immigrant men, almost 29 percent of the Israeli men were self
employed in 1990, versus only 3 percent for Laotian men.  Immigrant men with
high self-employment rates included Russians (25 percent), Greeks (23 percent),
and Cubans (16 percent).  Low self-employment rates were reported by Puerto
Ricans (4 percent) and Filipinos (5 percent).<p>
<p>
There are also distinct differences in the type of self employment.
Self-employed Russians, for example, tended to offer construction, health, or
legal and accounting services, while Chinese immigrants were  more likely to
own restaurants and Koreans small retail stores.<p>

This book is billed as an effort to predict "where technology, demographics and
history will take America and the world in the next 30 years."  Its many
assertions/predictions include "globalization causes the worldwide divisions of
have and have-not countries to be mirrored within the borders of even the
richest nations." (p20), since workers who compete in tradable goods will have
to  compete directly with the goods and services produced by lower wage workers
in stable developing nations, and other workers will have to compete with cheap
immigrant labor.<p>

<a name="RTFToC2">Salvadorans
TPS to Expire</a></a>
</a></h2>
<p>
On December 2, it was announced that Temporary Protected Status or TPS for El
Salvadorans will be allowed to lapse on December 31, 1994.  Over 500,000
Salvadorans are believed to have come to the US during the 1980s, most
illegally, when civil war killed about 70,000 people and death squads spread
terror.  Most Salvadoran applications for political asylum in the US during the
1980s were denied.<p>
<p>
The 1990 IMMACT granted Salvadorans TPS in the US, which was extended by
President Bush in 1992 and Clinton in 1993.  The civil war in El Salvador ended
in 1992, and INS Commissioner Meissner said that today the "situation in El
Salvador has improved significantly and no longer serves as a basis for
continuing 'temporary' asylum."<p>
<p>
An estimated one million Salvadorans live in the United States in 1994--half in
Los Angeles--meaning that one in six Salvadorans lives in the US.  About half
are legal immigrants.  Between 90,000 and 190,000 Salvadorans are protected by
the TPS which is expiring--the INS does not have more precise data.  <p>
<p>
Salvadorans who currently have work authorization will be granted automatic
nine-month extensions, according to a notice published in the Federal Register
on December 6, 1994.  Salvadorans who apply for asylum in the US before
September 1995 will be able to stay longer.  <p>
<p>
Salvadorans' asylum claims today are eligible for special due process
consideration under a 1990 court case that alleged that during the 1980s the US
discriminated against asylum -seekers from El Salvador and Guatemala.  Less
than five percent of the applications for asylum filed by Salvadorans have been
granted.  Some social service agencies are urging Salvadorans to request asylum
in order to prolong their US stays and possibly gain permanent residence status
at a future date.  Under US law, aliens who have been in the US for at least
seven years, have good moral character, and would face hardship if returned,
can remain in the US indefinitely.<p>
<p>
In a profile of Salvadorans in Long Island, New York, it was noted that
Salvadorans are already discussing ways to stay permanently in the US,
including marrying a US citizen or legal immigrant at the going rate of $3,000.
<p>
<p>
Many Salvadorans were attracted to the US  by jobs that paid $5 hourly, but
they expected to live at Salvadoran costs in the US.  With mainstream US prices
too high, they have spawned an underground economy in which medical and similar
services are offered by unlicensed providers at less than half the going rates.
Such "immigrant economies" are responsible for reviving turn-of-the-century
institutions, such as live poultry markets in New York City.<p>
<p>
Salvadorans in the US remit an estimated $600 million to $1 billion to their
country annually, much of it to regions devastated by the civil war.  The 5.4
million Salvadorans in 1992 had an average annual GNP of $1,200 per capita.
Salvadoran exports in 1992 were worth $400 million, and imports were worth $1.1
billion; the gap was financed by remittances.<p>
<p>
Commentators were divided on the whether the end of TPS was desirable.  Those
who favored ending TPS argued that, if TPS were extended once again, the entire
concept would be in danger, since opponents could argue that TPS was simply a
side door to permanent immigration.  Opponents argued that the Salvadorans were
truly refugees, and that US support for the Salvadoran government prevented the
US from recognizing the Salvadorans in the US as legitimate refugees who should
have been allowed to start their lives anew in the US.  Many advocates for
Salvadorans argued that there would be mass firings of persons whose work
permits would expire September 30, 1995.<p>

<a name="RTFToC3">US
Changes Asylum Regulations</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
In an effort to re-establish the proper balance "between compassion and
control," INS Commissioner Doris Meissner on December 2 announced that asylum
applicants will have to wait for a ruling on their applications, or for six
months, before receiving work permits.   Under current rules, asylum applicants
can receive work permits within 90 days of applying for asylum, allegedly
encouraging aliens to file false asylum claims in order obtain permission to
work in the US.<p>
<p>
There are 425,000 pending asylum applications, and about 13,000 more are filed
each month.  INS announced plans to add staff and streamline the processing of
asylum applications.  The number of asylum officers will be doubled to 334, and
the number of immigration judges will rise by 63 to 179.  <p>
<p>
With these additional staff, the INS hopes to interview each applicant and make
an initial decision on all applications within 60 days by April, 1995.  Final
decisions are expected within six months.  The INS decided not to charge
applicants for asylum a proposed $130 filing fee.<p>
<p>
In recent years, about 120,000 persons have applied each year for asylum,
generating 120,000 first-level decisions on whether an individual (and
dependents) should be granted refugee status in the US.  About 10 percent of
these decisions are appealed to the Board of Immigration Appeals, and 10
percent of them, or 1,200, are appealed to the Federal Courts of Appeal.  This
puts a heavy workload on a system not designed for so many cases--almost
one-fourth of the judges in the 9th Circuit, which includes California, spend
all their time on asylum cases.<p>
<p>
This means that the INS must "remove" from the US about 90,000 rejected asylum
seekers each year.  By all accounts, the removal system is not working well,
and the Commission on Immigration reform held a hearing on December 14 to
discuss methods to make the removal system work better.<p>
<p>
The INS has a three-section enforcement effort-- the so-called front, middle,
and back ends of the illegal immigration issue.  The front end refers to
efforts to keep illegal aliens and asylum seekers out of the US with border
controls and safe havens, the middle refers to employer sanctions and
eligibility tests for social benefits, and the back end refers to efforts to
removal of illegal aliens from the US.<p>
<p>
There are estimated to be four million illegal aliens in the US.  Every year,
about 1.3 million are located just inside the US-Mexican border, and almost all
of them agree to "voluntarily" return to their country of origin, Mexico.  In
addition, about 40,000 aliens are deported to a range of countries.<p>
<p>
The INS targets its limited resources on removing criminal illegal aliens after
they have served sentences in the US for crimes committed here.  Under US law,
illegal aliens are provided with lawyers at public expense to defend themselves
in criminal trials, but they are not provided with lawyers when, at the end of
their sentence, they are asked to show why they should not be deported to their
country of origin.  <p>
<p>
The 20,000 non-US citizens in federal prison are about one-fourth of all
federal prisoners, and the 30,000 non-US citizens in state prison are about
five percent of all state prisoners.  Half of the federal non-US citizens are
from Mexico and Colombia.  Most of the federal and many of the state alien
prisoners were convicted of smuggling drugs into or within the US.  In many
cases, those convicted are relatively low-level players, but they often have a
sufficient quantity of drugs that they commit felonies.  <p>
<p>
If aliens are released from prison, and then told to show up at a hearing so
that it can be determined whether they should remain in the US, virtually none
appear.  For this reason, immigration judges are going into federal and state
prisons to hold deportation hearings there, so that aliens can be deported as
they leave prison.<p>
<p>
Florida and the INS are cooperating on a program under which aliens convicted
of non-violent felonies are offered clemency if they agree to be deported.  If
the alien is later apprehended in the US, he/she must serve the original jail
term, plus up to 20 years for returning to the US after being deported.  In
this manner, more prison beds are made available for violent US citizen
offenders.<p>
<p>
It is widely agreed that the INS must do more than just remove criminal aliens
in order to make its removal policies credible.  The issue in most deportation
hearings is not whether the person should be deported--in most instances the
answer is yes--the issue is whether the alien who should be deported is
eligible for some form of relief from deportation, such as being in the US for
seven years, or developing an "equity stake" in the US.  There are private
attorneys in most cities with concentrations of aliens to advise aliens facing
deportation, for a fee, how to avoid deportation.<p>
<p>
Three of the many ideas advanced to speed up and make more credible removals
stand out.  First, add resources to INS and the courts so that hearings can be
conducted quickly, and removals ordered before aliens develop equity stakes.
Second, remove at least some non-criminal aliens to send the message that
removal is a real possibility e.g., remove with publicity some visitors who
overstay their I-94 tourist visas and aliens whose applications for asylum are
rejected.  Third, explore the use of incentives, such as refunding the alien's
share of social security contributions made while employed in the US if the
funds are claimed at the US consulate in the alien's country of origin within
30 days of the order to depart.  For alien's earning $1,000 per month, this
return incentive could amount to almost $1000 per year. <p>
<p>
FBI Director Freeh, in response to the World Trade Center bombing and other
terrorist incidents involving asylum seekers, endorsed proposals to speed up
processes for removing aliens from the US.  Freeh criticized current
regulations, which involve sending aliens letters asking them to "show cause"
why they should not be ordered to leave the US.  Most flee underground rather
than show up for their hearings.  Freeh would increase the bond to guarantee
the alien's appearance.<p>
<p>
According to Freeh, aliens making false asylum claims often enter the US under
the visa waiver program--under which 9.5 million persons arrived in FY 94--and
with student visas and through sham marriages to US citizens.  <p>
<p>
There is reported to be growing illegal immigration by rejected asylum seekers
from the US to Canada, especially along a six-mile stretch of border south of
Vancouver.  Many are reported to be Central Americans who crossed through the
US en route to Canada, where they thought their prospects of receiving asylum
were better.  For the first time in 1993, more asylum applications were filed
in downtown Vancouver than at ports of entry, suggesting that these applicants
entered the country unlawfully.<p>
<p>
Canada has a generous program for asylum applicants.  While waiting one or two
years for a decision, applicants are entitled to a work permit, housing,
welfare, and medical assistance, costing up to $37,000 per alien per year.<p>
<p>
During the summer of 1993, Canada resumed the deportation of criminal aliens to
countries considered dangerous, so that e.g., an Iranian alien convicted of
bringing heroin into Canada was deported even though drug dealers are sometimes
hanged there.<p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC4">Prop.
187--Enforcement Stayed</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
Citing serious constitutional questions, a federal judge in Los Angeles on
December 14 barred the enforcement of Prop. 187's requirement that public
schools and agencies verify the legal status of all persons seeking services
until its constitutionality is determined by the courts.  Judge Pfaelzer
expressed concern that enforcement of Prop. 187 could prompt immigrants
entitled to be in the US to leave the country when, e.g., the police question
those arrested about their immigration status, or when persons entitled to
services under federal law are denied services under Prop. 187 in California.
The judge's preliminary injunction blocks enforcement of all but two of the
initiative's provisions.  <p>
<p>
A state judge has prevented the enforcement of that section of Prop. 187 that
requires verification of legal status in order to obtain lower in-state tuition
at state colleges and universities.  Those portions of Prop. 187 that make it a
state felony to manufacture or distribute false identification papers have gone
into effect.<p>
<p>
In Los Angeles, public service announcements are being played on Spanish
language TV and radio that advise unauthorized immigrants that Prop. 187 is not
being enforced, and recommending that pregnant women and children should
continue to seek needed medical care.  In Sacramento, regulations to implement
187 are being prepared by state agencies, and there is a debate over what
obligation public employees have to report persons "reasonably believed" to be
illegal aliens, and what penalties can be levied on those who fail to report.<p>
<p>
Prop. 187 has slipped from the front pages of California newspapers.  Many of
the Prop. 187 stories in December were profiles of unauthorized immigrants who
were "confused" over which provisions of 187 were being enforced, and often
angry exchanges in letters to newspapers.  A typical profile described how an
eight-month pregnant unauthorized alien did not go to the doctor for fear of
detection and deportation, and her confusion and fears are, according to
immigration advocates, typical.  The number of patients at walk-in clinics
frequented by unauthorized aliens is reportedly down 10 to 20 percent in
southern California.  <p>
<p>
There have been reports that some Californians who supported Prop. 187 have
been asking Latino employees in restaurants and stores for their "green cards."
Prop. 187 does not give customers the right to demand identification from
employees, although one of Prop. 187's backers says that customers may want
assurance that employees are legal in places they frequent.<p>
<p>
Newspapers also report that, despite Prop 187's making the sale or use of false
documents to circumvent immigration laws a state felony, a provision of Prop.
187 that is in effect, fake drivers licenses, social security cards, and
immigrant visas or micas, are still being sold openly in MacArthur and
Huntington Parks in Los Angeles for $50 to $75.  On January 9, 1995, the first
three sellers of false documents are scheduled to be sentenced under Prop. 187
after pleading guilty to selling false documents.  They could receive jail
terms and then be deported.<p>
<p>
In the month since Prop. 187 was enacted, five people have been arrested for
selling false IDs.  Neither city nor county law enforcement agencies have made
arrests for the sale of false immigration documents a priority.  Police report
that false ID sellers are relatively sophisticated--a salesman takes the order,
a runner takes the order to the place where the documents are made, and a third
person delivers the false IDs.  Only at delivery can an arrest be made and,
even though all persons in the distribution chain can be prosecuted under Prop.
187, it has proven difficult to persuade those arrested to reveal their
collaborators.<p>
<p>
California's 8 million Hispanics are being urged to boycott companies such as
Disney that contributed to the re-election campaign of Governor Wilson.
Several groups have asked the nation's 25 million Hispanics to boycott
Disneyland, ridiculed as ''Migra Mouse.''<p>
<p>
Interviews with the drafters of Prop. 187 reveal that the initiative was
drafted by a committee of 10, and that the ban on public education for
unauthorized alien children was included in order to retain the support of the
activists who circulated the petitions to put Prop. 187 on the November 1994
ballot.  According to former INS Regional Commissioner Harold Ezell, Prop. 187
was tested by a couple looking for business for their campaign firm.  <p>
<p>
A California assemblyman, Richard Mountjoy, quickly convinced the "Committee of
10" that the most viable option would be an initiative denying public services
to illegal immigrants.  The fact that different sections have different
definitions of who is eligible for services has played a major role in court
orders to block 187's enforcement.<p>
<p>
The chair of the US Civil Rights Commission, Mary Frances Berry, expressed
concern that Prop. 187 could foster discrimination against Latinos.  At a
Washington, DC informational hearing on December 16, a co-author of 187, Ron
Prince, assured the commission that the initiative did not intend to promote
racial discrimination.  Instead, its aim is to cure "a present system that adds
up to discrimination against US citizens and legal residents of California," by
diverting resources to unauthorized aliens. <p>
<p>
On December 12, about 200 farm workers who typically earn $100 daily cutting
and packing celery for a Dole subsidiary, Bud of California, walked off their
jobs to protest Prop. 187.  The protest was organized by a Spanish-language
radio station in Oxnard to demonstrate the "economic clout" of unauthorized
workers.<p>
<p>
In a case not related to Prop. 187, the California Supreme Court upheld a state
regulation that requires persons seeking state-paid emergency health care to
provide a Social Security Number or admit that they are illegal aliens.  All
persons must be provided with care.<p>
<p>
The Prop 187 movement is spreading to other states.  Floridians for Immigration
Control announced on December 13 that they would mount an effort to enact a
Prop. 187-style state-run verification of eligibility for public benefits law.
Florida has sued the federal government to recoup some costs of providing
services to an estimated 322,000 illegal aliens.  Governor Chiles has announced
that he will oppose the Prop. 187 effort in Florida, saying that it is too
crude an attempt to deal with a complex issue.<b>  </b>Backers need 430,000
signatures by August, 1996 to put the proposal on the November 1996 ballot.<p>
<p>
In Suffolk County, New York, a decade of welcoming Salvadoran refugees ended
with the repeal last year of an ordinance that sheltered Salvadoran refugees.
This summer the county passed the "America First Welfare Reduction Program."
The county's resolution asked the state of New York for permission to deny
health care and welfare benefits to illegal immigrants, and to legal immigrants
who are not yet US citizens.  The state refused the request. <p>
<p>
The seven states with the most illegal immigrants--California, New York, Texas,
Florida, Illinois, New Jersey, and Arizona<b>--</b> have two-thirds of the
electoral votes needed to elect a US President.  Hispanic activists opposed to
Prop. 187-type measures have announced that they are working hard on the next
great civil rights movement--preserving the rights of legal and unauthorized
aliens.<p>
<p>
Many publications have run editorials decrying or praising Prop. 187.  In a
typical pro-187 editorial, US News and World Report called for giving more
preference in legal immigration to professionals, and requiring adult children
sponsoring their elderly parents to immigrate to the US to be responsible for
their economic well-being for at least 10 years after their arrival.  US News
also called for a reduction in the number of refugees, who are eligible for
welfare upon arrival.<p>
<p>
According to estimates done by The Rand Institute, 85 percent of the children
of illegal aliens in CA aged ten and under were born in the United States, and
are therefore US citizens.  Of those children who are aged 10 to 15, an
estimated 60 per cent were born in the US, and aged 15 to 19, around 50 per
cent.<p>
<p>
The GAO on November 30, 1994 estimated that California spends $2.35 billion per
year providing education, health, and justice services to illegal
aliens--two-thirds of these costs are incurred to provide education, and
one-sixth each to provide health care services and to incarcerate illegal
aliens.<p>
<p>
At a public hearing in mid December in Tijuana, speakers told a newly formed ad
hoc committee that Mexican consulates must become strong advocates for Mexican
citizens abroad.  The committee also discussed increasing its consular corps,
introducing dual US-Mexican citizenship, and developing a trilateral
immigration agreement tied to NAFTA.  The ad hoc committee, chaired by Carlos
Reta Martinez, has 20 members drawn from the PRI and three opposition parties.
The public hearing was the first of several to be held along the border and in
other parts of Mexico that send migrants to the US. <p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC5">Illegal
Immigrants and Devaluation in Mexico</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
In the aftermath of Mexican criticism of Operation Gatekeeper and Prop. 187,
there have been several reports of harsh Mexican policies toward illegal
immigrants in Mexico.  Although there are no "official" data on apprehensions
and expulsions, it is estimated that the number of mostly Central Americans
removed from Mexico during the first 11 months of 1994 averages 5,000 to 6,000
per month (Dec. MN).  There were reportedly 143,000 illegal aliens removed from
Mexico in 1993, and 90,000 in 1990.<p>
<p>
 Mexico's National Migration Institute reported that 3,651 illegal aliens were
"deported" between January and November, suggesting that most illegal aliens
are removed from Mexico informally rather than after a legal process.<b></b><p>
<b></b><p>
Mexico issues about 125,000 work permits to foreign workers each year.  A
public education is guaranteed to all children in Mexico, but most schools
require a birth certificate or a passport and visa to establish the identity of
the child.  This means that the children of illegal aliens are often barred
from Mexican public schools.  There have been roundups at hospitals to which
undocumented Central Americans go to seek medical treatment. <b></b><p>
<b></b><p>
Many of the illegal aliens in Mexico are Guatemalans employed in jobs that
range from picking coffee beans to construction and maids.  Violations of
Mexico's minimum wage, and of basic human rights standards, are reportedly
widespread where illegal Central Americans are employed.  <p>
<p>
There have been charges that Central Americans suffer rapes, beatings,
extortion, and robbery at the hands of Mexican employers and police.  One
advocate for unauthorized Central Americans in Mexico is Tapachula bishop Jorge
Arizmendi, who hopes that Prop. 187 will put Mexico's treatment of undocumented
workers onto Mexico's national agenda.  Some immigrants from Central America
say that they were treated far worse in Mexico  than the US. <p>
<p>
The potential embarrassment from these complaints to President Zedillo after
his denunciations of Prop. 187 reportedly prompted the Mexican government to
undertake a thorough review of its immigration policies and their enforcement.
In the past, Mexico has ignored Central Americans passing through to the US,
but now that some are apparently staying in relatively wealthier Mexico, the
government feels compelled to act.  Mexico has increased the number of
roadblocks near its border with Guatemala.<p>
<p>
Mexican GDP per capita ($3470 in 1992) is 3.5 times the Guatemalan level of
$980; picking coffee beans in Mexico pays twice as much as the same job in
Guatemala.  About 40,000 Guatemalans live in camps for political refugees in<p>
the state of Campeche.  During his campaign, President Zedillo had promised
more public spending to help the Mexican poor and to offset the inequality that
accompanied Mexico's boom, and lower interest rates to spur foreign and
domestic investment in Mexican factories, housing, and infrastructure.  <p>
<p>
Mexico was headed for a deficit in its current account trade balance of $30
billion in 1994, equivalent to almost eight percent of its $395 billion GDP.
Its reserves fell from $30 billion early in 1994 to $6 billion on December 22
as Mexico attempted to support the peso at a rate of 3.45 pesos to $1.
Nonetheless, Mexico's new Finance Minister, Jaime Serra Puche, confidently
predicted in mid-December that the economy would grow by four percent in 1995,
and that the peso-dollar exchange rate would remain stable.  <p>
<p>
On December 19, Zapatista rebels reported falsely that they had taken over 38
towns in Chiapas.  On December 20, Mexico devalued the peso, and it eventually
fell over 40 percent, from 3.4 pesos to $1 to 5.7 pesos to $1, before settling
at 5 pesos to $1 on December 29.  Mexican interest rates jumped to 40 percent,
credit dried up as banks stopped lending, the Mexican stock market fell
sharply, and there were fears that Mexico would not have enough dollars to pay
the interest it owes on its foreign debts.<p>
<p>
According to the estimates of University of California, Davis economist Ed
Taylor, a 10 percent devaluation of the peso could increase Mexico-to-US
migration by 17 percent (March MN).  If this village-based estimate proves to
be correct, there is likely to be a surge in Mexico-to-US migration.<p>
<p>
The Mexican explanation for the devaluation--to offset the capital flight
associated with Zapatista activity in Chiapas-- was described in the US as an
attempt to cover-up fundamental economic problems.  Some predicted that the
peso devaluation would be a blow to foreigners' confidence in the Mexican
economy.  Foreigners have $75 billion invested in Mexican financial markets,
and there were fears of a capital flight in 1995..  <p>
<p>
Mexico plans more privatization and stricter enforcement of rules designed to
promote competition in 1995, but it remains dependent on foreign investment for
the job creation needed to absorb one million new workforce entrants each year.
Mexican exports and internal savings are not sufficient to pay for the
country's imports, making Mexico dependent on an inflow of foreigners' savings.
As interest rates rose in the US and elsewhere, speculators bet that Mexico too
would have to raise interest rates, and that rising rates would slow economic
growth in Mexico, forcing Mexico to devalue the peso.  <p>
<p>
Devaluing the peso makes Mexican exports cheaper and more attractive to foreign
buyers, but it also fuels inflation in Mexico.  The Mexican government has
promised to cut government spending and allow interest rates to rise to prevent
an inflationary surge, but this means that the country risks recession that may
also reduce the attractiveness of the country to foreigners.<p>

<a name="RTFToC6">Another
Bracero Program Considered</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
On December 13, the Inter-American Institute on Migration and Labor organized a
meeting of 25 farm worker advocates in Washington DC to discuss the possibility
of a foreign worker program with Mexico.  Even though it was agreed that there
were far more signs of labor surplus than shortage, it was noted that the two
blades of the scissors could come together quickly to produce a program.<p>
<p>
Outgoing President Salinas and Governor Wilson in November, 1994 called for a
guestworker program that would allow Mexican workers to be employed in the US.
Salinas justified a program in terms of protecting the inevitable flow of
Mexican workers to the US; Wilson in terms of having workers come legally, and
managing their access to public services ( Dec. 1994 MN).<p>
<p>
US employers are currently allowed to recruit unskilled foreign workers to fill
vacant US jobs only after they convince the US Department of Labor that, after
a search for US workers at prevailing wages, and the offer of  benefits such as
free housing to temporary foreign farmworkers, no US workers are available.
Since 1990, there have been 35,000 to 40,000 unskilled foreign workers admitted
each year.  About half fill farm jobs, and half fill nonfarm jobs.<p>
<p>
Temporary alien farm workers are admitted under the H-2A program, and they cut
sugar cane in Florida, harvest tobacco in the Carolinas, pick apples in the
Northeast, and herd sheep in the West.  Many farm employers and most farm
worker advocates decry the H-2A program--the farmers because of DOL's role in
certifying--and perhaps rejecting--their need for foreign workers on a
job-by-job basis, and the advocates because DOL allegedly does not do enough to
assure that farmers truly recruit American workers.<p>
<p>
If labor shortages develop in Spring, 1995, and INS border controls are
perceived to have reduced significantly illegal immigration at the border, then
pressures could mount for a non-H-2A foreign worker program.  <p>
<p>
Farm worker advocates at the meeting discussed the elements of such a program
if one should be proposed.  One suggestion was to push for more effective labor
law enforcement to encourage employers to prefer Americans, but it was quickly
agreed that complaint-driven and money-assessment-evaluated enforcement can
have only limited effects on a farm labor market that matches one to two
million seasonal workers with three to four million seasonal jobs.  <p>
<p>
Some argued that, if there were to be a non-H-2A foreign worker program, it
should be a RAW-type program, under which foreign workers would gradually earn
the right to become immigrants by doing e.g., at least 90 days of farm work for
two or three years. <p>
<p>
It was generally agreed that IRCA and IRCA-sponsored research has changed both
the reality and the perception of the farm labor market.  The reality is that
most farmworkers, and virtually all new entrants to the farm work force, are
born abroad--the base "states" for US migrants have switched from Florida,
Texas, and California to central and southern Mexico.  The only disputed point
was the share of unauthorized workers in the stable farm work force--the range
of hard-to-verify estimates is 10 to 50 percent.  There is general agreement
that the share of unauthorized workers is rising, but the most credible
evidence available today points to smaller percentages of unauthorized aliens.
<p>
<p>
The seasonal farm labor market is increasingly disorganized.  As intermediaries
such as labor contractors assume a greater role in job matching, more workers
wind up working only a few hours per day, and a few days each week, even during
peak periods.  Second, the farm labor market has gotten so isolated that
non-marginal changes in wages and working arrangements would likely be required
to end the industry's dependence on immigrant workers without other US jobs
options.  However, if there were to be such non-marginal adjustments, the
demand for labor might fall sharply, via e.g., mechanization or trade.<p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC7">Gatekeeper
Reduces Apprehensions</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
On October 1, 1994, the INS launched Operation Gatekeeper, an experiment to
flood the westernmost section of the US-Mexican border with three lines of
agents to have a better chance of apprehending aliens attempting entry south of
San Diego.  Apprehensions along the six miles of border between the Highway 5
port of entry to the Pacific Ocean fell by half in October and November, from
600 to 800 per night to 200 to 300 per night.<p>
<p>
As apprehensions fall in the  most heavily guarded western sections of the
border, they are rising further east.  Overall apprehensions are down about 30
percent from year-earlier figures, but up sharply--over 100 percent--in what
were previously quiet mountain and desert areas.  There has also been a
significant increase in aliens attempting entry with counterfeit documents.<p>
<p>
Experts agree that the real test of Gatekeeper's effectiveness will come in
Spring, 1995, when aliens who are going home for Christmas attempt to return to
seasonal US jobs.  There may be more Mexicans attempting entry than usual
because of the December peso devaluation.<p>
<p>
In yet another report on "one of the Government's most troubled agencies" (Oct.
MN), the New York Times reported that the INS was promoting rather than
disciplining senior managers accused of sexual harassment and assault.  <p>

<a name="RTFToC8">Immigration
at the Summit of the Americas</a>
</a><br>
</h2>
President Clinton told the 34 leaders of Western Hemisphere countries that he
would like to see a free trade zone from Alaska to Argentina by 2005, but
newly-elected Mexican President Zedillo insisted on discussing immigration
during the Summit of the Americas on December 9-11, 1994 in Miami.  <p>
<p>
Several Central American leaders denounced Proposition 187, the California
initiative approved on November 8 that establishes a state-run verification
system to ensure that illegal aliens do not receive state-funded public
services.  Guatemalan President Ramiro De Leon called Prop 187 "a flagrant
and<p>
massive violation of human rights, especially for children."<p>
<p>
Vice President Gore reminded reporters that the Clinton Administration opposed

economic activity in the region, followed by Canada ($566 billion), Brazil
($425 billion), and Mexico ($295 billion).  Clinton cited figures indicating
that the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which took effect January
1, 1994, increased U.S. exports to Mexico by 22 percent and created more than
100,000 new US jobs.  US export-related jobs pay 17 percent more than average

<a name="RTFToC9">Cubans
Riot in Panama</a>
</a><br>
</h2>
On December 8, about 1,000 of the 8,500 Cubans being held in Panama rioted to
protest what they argued was the slow pace at which their cases were being
handled.  Over 200 American soldiers were injured, and hundreds of Cubans
escaped into the jungle.  By December 9, almost all of the escaped Cubans had
been re-captured. Two were found dead in the Panama Canal. <p>
<p>
Some of the 22,000 Cubans at the US Guantanamo Bay Naval Station, Cuba, rioted
on September 6.  There are also 4900 Haitians in Guantanamo--14, 650 have
returned to Haiti, and 25 were sent to the US for humanitarian reasons.<p>
The riots were allegedly sparked by the Clinton Administration's decision on
December 2 to admit Cuban families with children directly to the US, even
though, in August 1994, President Clinton asserted forcefully that Cubans could
come to the US only after being screened in Havana.  INS Commissioner Meissner
stressed that only children for whom continued living in the camps would
constitute "extreme hardship" would be admitted with their families to the US.
Living in tents and not attending school are not considered by the INS to be
"extreme hardship."<p>
<p>
There are about 3,000 children under 17 in the camps, and it is estimated that
8,000 or one-fourth of the Cubans being detained could be admitted directly to
the US under this "humanitarian" program.  The Clinton Administration maintains
that the 4,900 Haitians still in Guantanamo, 234 of whom are unaccompanied
children, will not be admitted to the US.  On December 19, a US appeals court
upheld the government's decision not to admit these children, and reversed a
lower court ruling that guaranteed refugee advocates access to Cubans and
Haitians in Guantanamo, although the government said that lawyers would still
be permitted in Guantanamo.<p>
<p>
In October 1994, the Clinton Administration made the first exception to its
only-visa-Cuba immigration policy when 300 elderly and sick Cuban refugees at
Guantanamo and their close family members, as well as 45 children without
relatives, were taken directly to the US.  So far, almost 700 Cubans have been
moved from Guantanamo to the US.<p>
<p>
On December 20, a US Appeals Court lifted at least temporarily all restrictions
on returning Cubans from Guantanamo to Cuba.  Refugee advocates persuaded a
judge to stop such voluntary returns until it is determined whether persons
seeking US asylum at US facilities outside the US have US constitutional
rights.<p>

Lawsuit Thrown Out</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
Florida was the first state to sue the federal government for reimbursement of
the costs of providing education, health, and justice services to unauthorized
immigrants.  On December 20, a federal judge threw out the state's lawsuit,
saying that the suit presented a "political issue" that he had no authority to
decide.  Florida's suit contended that the US government encourages illegal
immigration by not effectively controlling US borders and then requiring states
to provide services to them.  Florida's governor promised to appeal.<p>
<p>
Florida estimates that it spent $2.5 billion in 1993 to provide services to all
types of immigrants, including $884 million to provide services to 345,000
unauthorized immigrants.  <p>
<p>
A federal judge in Texas indicated that he too is inclined to dismiss that
state's suit for reimbursement.  However, California's Governor Wilson said
that the dismissal of Florida's lawsuit does not affect California's pending
lawsuit because California raises different claims.  California has three suits
pending in federal court in San Diego that seek as much as $10.5 billion in
federal reimbursement for the cost of providing services to unauthorized
immigrants over the past six years.<p>

<a name="RTFToC11">Immigration
in the 104th Congress</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
Senator Alan Simpson (R-WY), who lost by one vote his bid to be his party's
number two person in the US Senate, announced that he would oppose Republican
efforts to deny public benefits to legal aliens.  About half of the projected
savings in the Republican proposal to reform welfare--an estimated $21 billion
over five years-- would come from denying <u>legal </u>immigrants access to 60
federally-funded programs, from housing assistance to food assistance to legal
services, until they became naturalized US citizens.  Refugees would be exempt
for their first six years in the US, as would legal immigrants over 75 who have
been in the US  for at least five years.  <p>
<p>
There has been a great deal of discussion of the "quality" or integration
prospects of 1980s immigrants.  According to a Wall Street Journal summary,
this research casts "doubt on the widely held view that immigration is always a
net plus for the economy."  A Rand analyst asserted that adult immigrants who
enter the US labor market earning 30 percent less than US workers are likely to
leave the labor market still earning 30 percent less.<p>
<p>
University of California, San Diego Professor George Borjas has released
another paper that finds that recent immigrants are less educated and skilled
persons who "assimilate into welfare" in the US.  Despite the fact that the
Census includes illegal aliens and newly legalized aliens who are not eligible
for welfare, Borjas found that in the 1990 Census, 9.1 percent of all immigrant
households, but only 7.4 percent of US-born households, reported receiving
payments from welfare programs in 1989.  In their first years in the US,
foreign-born households (except refugees) are often not eligible for welfare,
so the percentage of households reporting welfare payments increases with time
in the US.  About 5.5 percent of those who immigrated between 1965 and 1970
reported receiving welfare in 1969, but 10 percent of this immigrant cohort
reported receiving welfare between 1980 and 1990.  <p>
<p>
Borjas points to the immigrants' fewer years of education, and thus low
earnings, as the reason why welfare usage rises over time.  An alternative
explanation may be changes in eligibility.  In the 1960s, there were still
residence requirements in many states that required a person to live for six to
12 months in the area before applying for welfare.  Similarly, the 1990 Census
asked about welfare usage in 1989, when about one-third of the 1980s immigrants
were newly-legalized aliens who were not eligible for welfare assistance until,
in most cases, 1993. <p>
<p>
Immigrants from Eastern Europe interviewed by a Wall Street Journal reporter
rejected the notion that they come to the US to receive federal benefits; some
note that countries such as Canada are far more generous to immigrants.  Under
the Republican proposal, legal immigrants already enrolled in assistance
programs would have one year to transition to US citizenship, if they are
eligible. <p>
<p>
The debate on immigrants and welfare is likely to emphasize that legal
immigration can impose costs on US taxpayers, and thus may lead to efforts to
reduce legal immigration, now running at 900,000 per year.  Simpson also
announced that he would push for the approval of legislation that would cut
planned legal immigration for five years, from 675,000 to 500,000 annually.
Simpson believes that such a cut would give the US "breathing space" to absorb
the recent wave of immigrants.<p>
<p>
Simpson asserted that he would try to repeal the 1966 Cuban American Adjustment
Act, which allows all Cubans who reach US shores to become legal immigrants
after one year.  This may be politically difficult, since many Florida Cubans
are ardent Republicans.<p>
<p>
Finally, Simpson wants to win approval for a counterfeit-resistant
identification system to improve the enforcement of employer sanctions.
Simpson also announced his opposition to Prop. 187's denial of education to
illegal alien children.<p>
<p>
In the House, Representative Lamar Smith (R-TX) has been named chair of the
Subcommittee on Immigration and Claims.  Smith has promised to "work diligently
to write a bipartisan solution to the problem of illegal immigration."<p>
<p>
Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-CA) has been named chair of a special congressional task
force on immigration reform.  The task force, whose membership has yet to be
determined, will work with the Governors of border states to draft legislation
to deal with immigration issues. <p>
<p>
Court decisions make it clear that Congress, but not the states, can deny
benefits to legal and illegal immigrants.  However, the US has traditionally
talked of "we the people" rather than "we US citizens." The Bill of Rights, for
example, defines the rights of people, not citizens, because the founding
fathers were citizens of individual states rather than the US.<p>
<p>
The debate within Republican circles over immigration continues, with Jack Kemp
and William Bennett arguing that Prop. 187-style efforts to discourage illegal
immigration by denying them services is wrong-headed and will push immigrants
into the Democratic party, repeating historic party mistakes such as opposing
the civil rights movement.  They would admit immigrants, but end bilingualism
and affirmative action programs that permit immigrants to get special
preferences under programs originally created to remedy governmental
discrimination against Blacks.<p>
<p>
Governor Wilson and William Buckley, on the other hand, believe that the
Republican party should embrace efforts to limit immigration.<p>

<a name="RTFToC12">H-1B
Final Rules</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
The US Department of Labor issued final regulations governing the employment of
temporary skilled foreigners in the US.  There were 110,000 H-1B workers
admitted in FY92, and 93,000 in FY93.  In 1993, 14 percent came from the UK,
and 9 percent were from Japan.<p>
<p>
The regulations, published in the Dec. 20 Federal Register, require US
employers to meet tougher standards to have their need for H-1B workers
certified, and reduce the validity of the H-1B visas from six to three years.
H-1B aliens are persons coming to work temporarily in the United States in
"specialty occupations"--generally professional-level positions requiring at
least a bachelor's degree.  There is to be an annual limit of 65,000 H-1B
visas.<p>
<p>
Most of the disputes over the regulations involved proposals to require labor
contractors who were requesting certification to employ H-1B workers to satisfy
additional steps to certify that there was a genuine shortage of American
workers, and that the employment of the aliens would not displace US workers.
In its final rule, the Department of Labor decided "at this time" not to
establish special procedures for contractors.  The final regulation "is both
less burdensome for employers and more protective of workers" than the original
proposal, the department said.<p>
<p>
In a related story, several employee and lobbying groups are seeking to change
H-1B program, which they allege allowed a company to eliminate jobs in a
Livingston, New Jersey plant and transfer the jobs to immigrant workers in
North Carolina.  The US Department of Labor is investigating North
Carolina-based Syntel, which allegedly employed H-1B  foreign workers in NC.
Syntel claimed that American workers did not have the necessary skills for
certain programming language and software tasks.  Many H-1B foreign workers are
computer programmers and physical and occupational therapists.  <p>

1986, has announced preliminary new regulations that would raise their pay to
at least $155 weekly--for a maximum 45 hours--and require that au pairs caring

<a name="RTFToC16">Immigration
and Population Change in Germany</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
On December 15, 1994, the Friedrich Ebert Stiftung and the American Institute
for Contemporary German Studies sponsored a conference in Washington, DC at the
American Enterprise Institute on Population Prospects for United Germany.  The
major conclusion was that the German population, now 81 million, will shrink,
and that the foreigners' share of the population, now eight percent, will
rise.<p>
<p>
Two major demographic issues were discussed.  First, what will Germany's
population be in the 21st century, given that fertility is below replacement
levels and that the country is avowedly not a country of immigration?  Second,
how will the Germans be distributed between the former east and western
sections of the country?<p>
<p>
Under all population projections, Germany's population will shrink, but
immigration is the major demographic variable that will determine by how much
Germany's population shrinks.  Government projections assume that 225,000
ethnic German Aussiedler per year will arrive until the year 2000, and then
their number will gradually decrease, so that none arrive in 2011.  Even though
Germany is not a country of immigration, it permits Germans and foreigners
living in the country to unify their families, so population projections have
three immigration scenarios:  100,000 net immigrants per year, 200,000, and
300,000.  <p>
<p>
Germany does not distinguish between foreigners and natives in its population
projections.  However, assuming that fertility throughout united Germany
converges to the West German rate of 1.4 by 1996, that mortality converges by
2030, that there are 300,000 net new immigrants per year, and that Germany does
not change its naturalization laws and practices, in 2030 the population would
shrink to 77 million, and foreigners would be 20 percent of all residents.  <p>
<p>
If a net 400,000 foreigners arrived each year, and naturalizations remain at
current levels, foreigners would be 30 percent of the population in 2030.  This
means that, in some cities, foreigners are likely to be a majority of the
population under current naturalization rates and policies.  Some assert that
well before Germany reached Swiss levels of foreigners--about 17
percent--naturalization laws and procedures would change.<p>
<p>
Where will Germany's shrinking population live?  At unification in 1990, there
were about 16 million East Germans and 63 million West Germans.  Since
unification, marriage and fertility rates in the East have fallen
sharply--further than they fell after World War II--and mortality has risen
sharply.  <p>
<p>
This demographic shock in the east is expected to  be short-lived.  Much of the
fertility decline is due to young women marrying later and postponing children.
One reason why marriages and births declined by 65 percent since 1989 is
because the demographic transition to capitalism was compressed in East
Germany, compared to the more gradual adjustments to the market in Poland and
other East European nations.  After East German women adjust to the 3 C's of
career, consumption, and childbirth, their marriage and fertility behavior is
expected to return to (low) West German levels.<p>
<p>
East Germany in the 21st century may no longer include one in five Germans.<b>
</b> Between 1989 and 1993, some 1.3 million East Germans moved West, and
250,000 persons in the West moved East, for a net internal migration of over
one million.  <p>
<p>
Even if young East German women who today seem to be delaying childbirth begin
having children in their late 20s and early 30s, as expected, the fact that
virtually all immigrants currently go to West Germany means that the East
German share of the German population is likely to shrink.  If there were no
more internal migration after 2005, and fertility and mortality converge as
expected, East Germany would still shrink from about 16 million in 1990 to 13
million by 2010, and older than average East German residents would represent
about one in six Germans.<p>

In November, 12,056 aliens requested asylum in Germany, bringing the total for
the first 11 months of 1994 to 114,024.  Almost one-fourth of the November 1994
applicants were from the ex-Yugoslavia, and one-fifth were from Turkey.<p>
<p>
Of the 26,343 asylum cases decided in November, 8.3 percent were approved.  So
far in 1994, there have been decisions on 324,682 applications for asylum, and
there are another 119,076 cases awaiting decisions.  Beginning December 8,
nationals of the Ivory Coast, Togo, Benin, Niger and Burkina Faso require a
visa to visit Germany.<p>
<p>
Germany spent a reported DM 15.5 billion ($10 billion) on the 400,000 persons
from the former Yugoslavia who are in Germany in 1994, or $25,000 each. <p>
<p>
Several of Germany's 16 Laender have begun charging asylum seekers whose
applications have been rejected the costs of their deportation.  However, only
5 to 10 percent of the failed asylum seekers actually pay.  Removing aliens who
do not have the right to stay in Germany is the responsibility of individual
Laender.<p>
<p>
Germany announced that to protest Turkey's sentencing eight Kurdish members of
parliament to prison terms for their alleged involvement with the Kurdish
Workers Party (PKK), no Kurds would be returned to Turkey between December 12,
1994 and January 20, 1995.  The FDP announced that it may try to get the ban on
deportations extended, and the German Green party called for an economic
embargo on Turkey and the granting of residence rights to Kurds in Germany.
New Turkish Foreign Minister Soysal rejected criticism of Turkey's treatment of
"the Kurdish problem."  Turkey did not accept the 10 percent of the US's $360
million in military aid for FY95 that was tied to Turkey's improvement of its
human rights record.<p>
 <p>
German Labor Minister Norbert Blum is planning to change rules and enforcement
that have allowed up to 100,000 British construction workers to be employed in
Germany and not pay German Social Security taxes.  The UK, joined by Portugal,
blocked a European Commission plan to provide the same wages and  employment
rights for workers "assigned" by their employers in other member states as
those that apply to local workers.  This allegedly permitted low wage British
construction workers to displace German construction workers.<p>
<p>
The Institute of German Business (IW) of Cologne surveyed German businesses and
concluded that foreigners were successfully integrated into schools, training,
and jobs.  Many foreign workers have been employed by the same companies for
years, and integration in the workplace is marked by tolerance and
understanding.  The language barrier has lessened over time, making for
relatively trouble-free communication.<p>

CSU leader Peter Gauweiler in Munich has called for an immigration law that

Other CSU politicians attacked this proposal.  Some termed any immigration
undesirable given Germany's high unemployment rate and housing shortages, while

Immigration Priorities</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
On December 22, 1994, nine EU nations agreed in Berlin to implement the
border-free Schengen agreement on March 26, 1995.  The Schengen Agreement, was
drawn up in 1985, and implementation has been delayed four times.<p>
<p>
The Schengen Information System (SIS) in Strasbourg already includes data on
700,000 criminals and other undesirables. <p>
<p>
EU General Affairs Council directive COM(94)38 requires member states to permit
settled nationals from within the EU to vote and to run for local office,
opening the possibility of, e.g., a non-German Spanish mayor in Germany.  EU
citizens already have the right to vote locally for members of the European
Parliament.  France, Luxembourg and Belgium have been granted exceptions
because, e.g., mayors in France have some law enforcement powers, so that only
French citizens may be elected mayor.   In Luxembourg and Belgium, EU nationals
must be residents for six years before they can vote in local elections.<p>
<p>
The French, who assume the Presidency of the EU effective January 1, 1995, have
been asked to deal quickly with a long list of difficult immigration issues:
the sharing between EU members of the burden resulting from the hosting of
refugees, the development of common legal guarantees for asylum seekers, the
uniform interpretation of the term "refugee," and determining which country is
responsible for each asylum application filed, according to the Dublin
Convention.<p>
<p>
In the past, it has proven to be hard to get the required unanimous approval of
12 (15 after Jan. 1, 1995) interior and foreign affairs ministers on these
issues.<p>
<p>
Seven countries have agreed to remove passport controls between them as of
March 26, 1995.  The Schengen Accord will also introduce a standard visa valid
in all the member countries and create a single information system for the
police system. Germany, France, Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Spain and
Portugal will implement the accord in March, while Italy and Greece will join
later.  Freer travel restrictions between the Schengen states will be
counterbalanced by tougher identity checks at borders with non-EU nations to
counter crime and illegal immigration. <p>
<p>
Britain is opposed to an EU directive that would require standard treatment of
foreign workers in EU countries.  <p>
<p>
At the European Union summit in Essen, Germany, police detained 500 to 600
people marched against EU immigration policies.  The EU announced new programs
to accelerate development of the EU's Mediterranean rim.  <p>
<p>
Albania provides an example of the challenge.  The 3.4 million residents have
an average annual GDP of less than $500.  The country received about $290
million in foreign investment in 1993, only one-third as much as 600,000
Albanians abroad sent home in remittances.  Some hope to turn Albania into a
tourist destination for sun-seekers, but many beaches are not reachable by
road, and there are 750,000 concrete bunkers at others built to repel
invaders.<p>

Reports on Trafficking, Transit Migration</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
The IOM reports that aliens are paying $300 to $30,000 each to be smuggled into
their country of choice.  They have created a migrant smuggling business that
generates $5 to $7 billion annually, according to papers presented at the 11th
seminar on migration held by the International Organization for Migration in
Geneva October 26-28, 1994.  The lowest fees are paid to smuggle aliens across
land borders, as with the $300 fee often paid to cross the US-Mexican border,
and the highest fees are paid to be smuggled long distances, as from China to
the US via southeast Asia and Latin America.<p>
<p>
The alien smuggling business requires an alien who is willing to pay to be
smuggled across borders and a smuggler or intermediary willing to take the
payment and at least attempt the smuggling.  Many alien smugglers also move
other items across borders, including drugs, since they already have false
documents, safe houses, and methods of arriving in remote areas of the
destination country.<p>
<p>
As industrial countries tighten their immigration controls, and pressures to
emigrate rise, the cost of migrating illegally and the potential profits of
alien smugglers also increase.  Migrants seeking a better life may wind up in
the clutches of often brutal international crime syndicates-- the reputation of
such organizations for revenge makes them reluctant witnesses against smugglers
even if they are detected.  <p>
<p>
Some 230 delegates representing 70 governments and 40 international
organizations agreed that fighting international alien smuggling syndicates
should become a higher priority on national and international agendas.  In
waging this fight, it was noted frequently that the rights of migrants should
be protected, and that the demand for migrant services should be reduced as
much as possible by creating other options for migrants to enter industrial
countries.<p>
<p>
On the international level, governments were urged to see alien smuggling for
what it is--a growth industry that permits often criminal elements to capture
the 10 or 20 to 1 income gaps between emigration and immigration countries.
Freer trade and capital flows eliminated many of the profits to smugglers of
goods and capital, and governments must realize that, if there is uneven
development in an increasingly integrated world in which migration is
restricted, they will have to place a high priority on combating alien
smuggling.  <p>
<p>
Specific steps urged were the international exchange of data on alien
smugglers, agreements between countries on the return of migrants to their
countries of origin, and coordinated law enforcement efforts to deal with
international aliens smuggling syndicates.  Longer term measures to accelerate
stay-at-home development were also recommended.<p>
<p>
A study on transit migration in Hungary released by the International
Organization for Migration reports that up to two million migrants are living
in Central Europe who want to move to the West.  Their number is continuing to
grow, because of the war in the former Yugoslavia, and immigration regulations
in Western Europe strand migrants in Central Europe. <p>
<p>
Over 70 percent of the migrants questioned about their future plans wanted to
move West; 60 percent said they would go to any Western nation. Germany and
Austria are the favored destinations for people from Eastern Europe; the US is
preferred by those from the former Soviet Union.  In Hungary, an estimated
70,000 to 100,000 foreigners are working illegally.  Most are young single men;
60 percent are college educated.  The Hungarian government will issue 2,000
immigration permits for 1995.  <p>

IOM is an international organization that helps member states to manage
migration, that conducts research on international migration, and that
encourages social and economic development via migration.  A summary of the
conference papers on alien smuggling will be published in International

<a name="RTFToC30">Managing
Migration in Japan</a></h2>
The 15th Nihon University International Symposium brought together 70
researchers and policy makers from December 5-7, 1994 to discuss the problems
involved in managing migration during the Pacific century.  Nihon is the
largest university in Japan--it has about 5,000 professors and 80,000 students
on 14 campuses--and it differs from other Japanese universities in its concern
for issues throughout Asia.<p>
<p>
Most of the papers dealt with the challenge of managing migration to Japan.  By
all measures, the number of foreigners entering Japan has been rising sharply.
The number of foreign arrivals in 1992 was four million, the number of
foreigners registered as living in the country was 1.3 million, and the number
of foreigners who overstayed the tourist visas most foreigners use to enter
Japan was about 300,000.  <p>
<p>
The focus of most papers was on foreigners who work in Japan.  There are only
about 100,000 legal foreigners among the country's 62 million workers.  About
one-fourth of these legal foreign workers are entertainers, one-fourth are
engaged in international services, including teaching English, and 10 percent
are engineers.  <p>
<p>
Japan does not permit the importation of unskilled foreign workers, but there
are believed to be 300,000 to 500,000 illegal foreign workers in the country,
mostly filling so-called 3-D jobs--dirty, dangerous, and difficult.  Over
60,000 foreign workers were apprehended in 1992 and 1993, and two-thirds were
from three countries--Malaysia, Iran, and Korea--with each country accounting
for about 14,000 apprehensions.  About four-fifths of the illegal foreign
workers were men, and half of them were working in construction,--another
one-fourth were detected working in factories.  One-third of the women detected
were hostesses, and another one-sixth were working in factories.<p>
<p>
Japan is well aware of the gap between its policy of no unskilled foreign
workers and the reality that at least several hundred thousand such workers are
at work.  However, there seems to be little consensus for a large-scale
immigration solution.  If legal immigration to Japan were at British levels of
0.1 percent of the population, Japan would accept about 125,000 immigrants
annually.  If Japan took as many immigrants as the US, it would accept 500,000
immigrants annually, adding about 0.4 percent to the population annually via
immigration.<p>
<p>
There also seems to be in Japan little enthusiasm for a German-style
guestworker system, through which about 10 percent of the workforce in Germany
eventually became foreign workers.  In the Japanese case, this would imply
about six million foreign workers.  The major fear of adopting the German
probationary immigrant system--workers who proved to be satisfactory could have
their work and residence permits renewed, and send for their families--is the
settlement of "incompatible foreigners."<p>
<p>
Japan has not totally rejected the immigration and guestworker options.  There
are 150,000 mostly Brazilian descendants of turn-of-the-century Japanese
emigrants to South America in Japan, and about 100,000 legal foreign workers.
But there is little possibility that these systems will be used to admit more
than perhaps 500,000 foreign workers.<p>
<p>
Instead of opening the front door to legal immigrants, or the guestworker side
door, Japan seems most likely to tolerate unauthorized workers and to accept
foreign workers through trainee and student sidedoors.  If backdoor and
non-labor market sidedoors turn out to be the major avenues through which
foreign workers enter Japan, then Japan will be charting a new path to managing
migration, implicitly asserting that the unskilled foreign workers present in
the country are unwanted or that they are simply acquiring skills to be used at
home.<p>
<p>
It is not clear that the Japanese attempt to use trainee, student, and
toleration-of-unauthorized worker policies will prove durable in the 21st
century.  There are fears that these polices, singly or in combination, could
generate immigrant settlement in Japan and socio-economic problems<p>
<p>
There was a great deal of discussion of the trainee program.  Since 1954, the
Japanese government has had a program under which young Asians could enter the
country to receive training that would accelerate their country's development.
Japanese firms that invested abroad used this program to train future country
managers since the 1950s.<p>
<p>
But over the past five years, small Japanese firms that have never invested
abroad have become dependent on foreign trainees.  There are 40,000 trainees
employed in Japan in 1994.  About 90 percent are Asian, including 40 percent
from China.  Most--83 percent --are employed in manufacturing, usually by small
and medium-sized firms.  The trainees are generally very well educated by the
standards of their countries of origin.<p>
<p>
Many prominent Japanese advocate expanding the trainee system to permit up to
500,000 foreigners to enter Japan.  To most outside observers, this would mean
that Japan is opening itself to foreign workers, although calling them
trainees.  Trainees get paid $400 to $800 monthly, or just one-fourth to
one-half as much as Japanese workers.  The quality and content of the training
is left up to each firm, so there is room for abuse in both training and in the
housing that employers are required to provide trainees.  Finally, there is
supposed to be a one-year limit on how long trainees can stay in Japan,
although employers are pushing for a two-year limit.<p>
<p>
There was general agreement that the problem of managing immigration--which
results from rapid growth and labor shortages--is far preferable to the
alternative of emigration pressures.  However, there was widespread criticism
of the short-term perspective through which most Asian policy makers evaluate
migration issues, producing many skeptics of the notion that there will be yet
another Asian miracle in finding a mutually beneficial way to manage labor
migration and avoid unanticipated results.<p>

<h2>
Foreigners in Japan</a></h2>
A private panel on December 26 recommended to the Justice Ministry that Japan
increase the number of foreign workers with specialized skills, and also
increase efforts to detect and deport illegal aliens.  The panel noted that
1990 revisions to Japan's immigration laws have increased the number of
foreigners overstaying their visas.<p>
<p>
Since a September crackdown, some 2365 illegal foreigners--1,442 men and 923
women--have been deported from Japan.  Most were apprehended while working in
or near Tokyo, Osaka and Nagoya.  One-quarter (509) of those apprehended were
from South Korea, 363 were Thais, and 292 were Chinese.<p>
<p>
Four unions in the Tokyo area are expected to call for equal treatment of
foreign workers under labor laws in a paper to be released in February 1995.
Between April 1993 and March 1994, 404 cases of work-related problems involving
foreign workers were brought to the four unions.  Over one-third of the
complaints involved unpaid wages, and another one-third involved layoffs.<p>
<p>
In Tokyo, a Chinese illegal alien who sued authorities for injuries she
received during an October 31, 1994 immigration raid was deported.  The Justice
Ministry has ordered an inquiry into allegations that Japanese immigration
officials frequently use violence against foreign detainees.  In late December,
two Chinese illegal aliens were given jail sentences for visa violations; one
arrived on a two-year student visa six years ago.<p>
<p>
Thailand's foreign minister personally gave 20,000 baht ($800) to the families
of two Thai workers who committed suicide in Japan in 1994.  Both Thais paid
200,000 baht each to job brokers, who then left them to fend for themselves in
Japan.<p>
<p>
The Thai government has launched an educational campaign to help prevent Thai
workers from being deceived by job brokers about the prospects for work in
Japan.  There are believed to be 50,000 Thais living illegally in Japan.<p>
<p>
There are reported to be hundreds of "orphans" in Japan, usually the children
of illegal alien women and Japanese men.  They are non-persons in Japan.<p>
<p>
According to one summary, the Japanese believe themselves to be descended from
a sun goddess, and there is reportedly widespread agreement that the Japanese
gene pool must be protected from contamination.  In order to be a Japanese
citizen from birth, a Japanese father must acknowledge his paternity before the
foreign woman gives birth.  In some cases, children of Japanese mother and a
foreign father can be considered Japanese.  <p>
<p>
A missionary couple was able to use a 19th century law to persuade the Japanese
Supreme Court to grant citizenship to a baby they adopted after it was
abandoned by a woman believed to be a Filipino prostitute.  Local officials
reportedly conducted one -year checks of two and three year olds to determine
whether they had criminal records that might invalidate their naturalization
applications.<p>
<p>
Aliens can petition for Japanese citizenship after three years of lawful
residence, but the Catch 22 is that Japan allegedly does not permit three years
of lawful residence to persons likely to apply for naturalization.<p>

Planters--Open Malaysia to Foreign Workers</a></h2>
A leading planter on December 6 argued that Malaysia should allow a free flow
of workers among the six ASEAN countries to resolve labor shortages and
surpluses.  A. Navamunkundan of the National Union of Plantation Workers
(NUPW), one of the world's largest farm worker unions, countered that the
solution to plantation labor shortages in Malaysia is "to uplift the image of
the plantation industry by providing high wages and good employment benefits
for the workers."  If plantations were considered "industrial agriculture,"
they might be expected to pay factory wages and attract workers now pouring
into electronics and other factories.<p>
<p>
One official criticized the rubber industry for not adopting the labor-saving
tools developed by the Rubber Research Institute.  Semi-automatic tapping
knives, for example, are cheap, but are not widely used, in part because
foreign workers have been readily available.  According to one official,
Malaysian plantations will have to continue to rely on foreign workers, but
foreign workers should not be considered a long-term solution to labor
shortages.  <p>
<p>
It was estimated that Malaysia has lost over 6,000 bus and truck drivers to
Singapore because of higher wages there.  A political and economic risk service
predicted recently that Malaysia's current labor shortage will affect the
country's competitiveness seriously and prove a real threat to economic growth
in 1995.<p>
<p>
As a result of abuses, Malaysian employers may no longer be allowed to directly
recruit foreign workers, according to the Home Ministry.  After the first
meeting ever held between the Home Ministry and recruitment agencies, it was
announced that there have been cases of Malaysian employers extorting money
from foreign workers coming into the country.<p>
<p>
Since January 1, 1994, Malaysia has banned the recruitment of unskilled and
semi-skilled foreign workers, but permitted exceptions in some cases for
employers who recruit foreign workers directly.  Malaysia requires 70 local for
every 30 foreign workers in most Malaysian workplaces, but grants exceptions to
sectors such as plantations.<p>
<p>
The Human Resources Ministry's Prospective Employment in Manufacturing<p>
survey predicts that, despite current shortages of unskilled workers, by 2000
there will be surpluses of unskilled workers, and shortages of skilled and
professional workers.  Malaysia has one of Asia's highest percentage of foreign
workers, 4 to 10 percent, depending on the estimate, much higher than the
estimated one percent in Taiwan and 0.6 percent in Japan.  Most foreign workers
in Malaysia are unskilled workers in the plantation and construction sectors.

Singapore Levies on Foreign Workers</a></h2>
Singapore announced in early December that it would reduce its dependence on
unskilled foreign workers by raising monthly levies for some categories of
unskilled workers, including foreign maids, and reducing them for skilled
foreign workers.  The changes take effect on April 1,1995.<p>
<p>
Employers of foreign workers must pay a monthly levy or tax to the government,
making Singapore one of the few countries to take advantage of wage gaps
between countries to increase its general tax revenues.  Most observers believe
that the wages paid to foreign workers are lower because of the levy.<p>
<p>
Singapore's Labor Minister told builders that "You must be able to steer away
from the mind-set of going for low-cost and low-skilled labor and low-tech
methods."  In November 1992, the construction sector was allowed to use five
foreign workers for each local worker, up from the previous three to one ratio,
but construction productivity did not improve.  Therefore, the levy on
unskilled construction workers will go up by 10 per cent from $S 400 ($275) to
$ 440 a month, while the levy on skilled workers will go down by 20 per cent
from $S 250 to $ 200.  <p>
<p>
Local observers expect subcontractors to be hit hardest by the higher levies.
Many general contractors turn over work at piece-rates to "kepalas" or labor
sub-contractors who hire their own workers--many kepala worker are believed to
be illegal aliens.<p>
<p>
Between January and September 1994, Singapore courts levied fines totaling S$
4.1 million on 278 employers of illegal foreign workers.  In 1993, 415
employers were fined S$ 4.3 million; Singapore expects fines to be higher in
1994.  Employers of illegal alien workers can be fined up to 24 months of the
levy due on them.  With levies running S$ 300 to S$ 450 per month, this makes
fines S$ 7,200 ($4900) and S$ 9,600 per illegal worker.  Employers of illegal
aliens can also be jailed for six months to two years and, if they hired more
than five illegal workers at the same time, caned.<p>
<p>
In early December, courts levied some of the heaviest ever fines, S$16,000 per
illegal alien worker hired at a construction site; S$ 25,200 for hiring two
Malaysians as hairdressers(42 months' levy), S$ 9,600 or 32 months' levy for
hiring a Malaysian illegal worker as a stall assistant, $ 10,500 or 35 months'
levy for employing a food service worker, and S$ 10,500 or 35 months' levy for
employing an illegal Malaysian as a welder..<p>
<p>
The Labor Ministry has promised to monitor closely pick-up points where
employers look for illegal foreign workers. <p>
<p>
In one account of a 2 am police raid on a construction site, 16 of 200 foreign
workers were determined to be illegal aliens.  At another site, 19 illegal
aliens were arrested after the police were called in to break up a fight.<p>
<p>
An illegal Chinese immigrant who entered Singapore in 1943, and married a
Singaporean in 1983, was jailed for three months and one week when it was
discovered that, for several years, he was using a friend's identity card.  He
may not be repatriated, but the Immigration Department stressed that "illegal
immigrants cannot be allowed to settle down in Singapore on the same terms as
permanent residents as this would only encourage many others to resort to
unlawful means to reside here."<p>
<p>
Like many other Asian nations, Singapore has a Central Provident Fund (CPF) to
which employers and workers each contribute 40 percent of their wages.
Singaporean citizens can withdraw of up to 40 percent of their CPF savings to
buy a house, but the estimated 50,000 Malaysian workers and other foreign
workers are only allowed to withdraw their CPF contributions after the age of
55.<p>

<h2>
Export and Import of Workers in Thailand</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
Dr. Amara Pongsapich of Chulalongkorn University has called for a Thai
immigration policy that recognizes reality:  Thailand both imports<p>
and export workers in construction, and imports and exports female workers in<p>
the service sector.  The Thai government has recognized the shortage of
professionals, and has allowed unskilled workers entry on a provisional basis.
<p>
<p>
There are an estimated 300,000 to 500,000 illegal foreign workers in
Thailand--most are from Burma, now known as Myanmar.  The Thai immigration
authorities complain that they can detain only 1,500 illegal immigrants, and
that at least two months are required to process the paperwork needed to deport
an illegal immigrant.<p>
<p>
Today's fourth wave of Thai workers who emigrate no longer find riches abroad,
according to Amara.  Recruiters often take one-third of their wages, and they
are subject to exploitation abroad.  This is very different from the first wave
of male and semi-skilled Thais who went to the Middle East in the 1970s, and
the second wave of less skilled males who also&nbsp;went to the Middle East in
the 1980s.  The third wave in the late 1980s saw Thai workers shift toward
Asian destinations, and more women among the migrants.<p>
<p>
The Thai National Security Council estimates that in the past few years 283,500
Burmese, both labor migrants and political dissidents, have entered Thailand.
Burmese seek low-wage jobs in factories, agriculture and fishing boats.
Burmese women find work as maids, in factories or small shops and as
prostitutes.  There are estimates that 10,000 immigrants travel between Rangoon
and Victoria Point on Thai fishing boats earning about 1,500 to 2,000 baht per
month.  The Burmese work first on the fishing trawlers then move onto higher
paying work in construction or shops.  Thai officials acknowledge that
employers take advantage of the illegal Burmese workers who can not complain
due to fears of arrest and deportation. <p>
<p>
In Thailand, some 40,000 to 50,000 Hmong political refugees and asylum-seekers
fear repatriation to Laos under the Luang Prabang Tripartite Agreement (LPTA),
launched in 1991 by the Thai, Laotian and United Nations' High Commissioner for
Refugees with US financing.  In September, 1994, some 5,000 refugees at the Na
Pho camp in northeast Thailand signed a petition sent to the US Congress,
asking it to stop their forced repatriation to Laos.  The Hmong are protesting
the Laotian government's role in where and how they are resettled.<p>

<a name="RTFToC31">Chinese
Migrants</a></h2>
According to some estimates, one-third of China's peasants are idle most of the
year, urban unemployment is between 16 to 20 percent, rural unemployment hovers
around 37 percent and 10 percent of all Chinese workers are internal migrants.
Ten million new people are expected to enter the urban job market in 1995,
while 10 million in state companies have no actual work to do and the number of
rural workers seeing jobs in the city will rise to 30 million, according to the
Chinese Labor Minister. <p>
<p>
Inequality is believed to be a major force motivating internal migration within
and from China.  Those employed in joint-venture factories along China's
southern coast can earn $100 per month, ten times the monthly wage in other
areas of China.  Their wages are rising faster than inflation, which is rising
at about 40 percent per year, while other workers' wages are not.  <p>
<p>
Chinese cities in the booming coastal areas are taxing the wage gap between the
regions by charging internal migrants $3,000 to $10,000 for the residence
permits needed to obtain housing and subsidized food and transportation in them
(Oct. MN).  These richer areas can afford to pay more for food, driving up food
prices everywhere, and investments in the coastal areas appear more promising,
so savings leave poorer regions.  Some speculate that the increasing inequality
between cities and rural areas, and between China's 30 provinces, could fuel
both migration and unrest.<p>
<p>
Shanghai, a city of 7.1 million, has over 3 million temporary residents.
Special organizations offer technical training for migrant workers.  The city
government has developed regulations to manage migrants, and established labor
offices for them.  Nearly 1.35 million people from outside the city have
registered in Shanghai, and 500,000 have received certificates to work.  Over
48,000 people have been sent back to their homes since August, 1994. <p>
<p>
Beijing is also considering legislation to control the capital's 3.4 million
migrants. Laws aimed at controlling crime, transport, public hygiene, and
family planning are expected in 1995.  Beijing has a permanent population of
over 10 million. Fifty-five percent of the temporary population have lived in
the city for over six months, and 23 percent for more than one year. Many of
the workers live in "villages" named after their native provinces and work in
vegetable markets, construction and service industries. <p>

80 percent of them ethnic Koreans -- in South Korea, and their legal status
ranges from legal worker to trainee to illegal alien.<p>

Migrants Return to Vietnam</a>
</a><br>
</h2>
The US trade embargo on Vietnam was lifted in February, 1994, and as many as
10,000 Vietnamese each month are returning for visits to the country that they
or their parents fled to visit friends and relatives and to check out business
opportunities.  Some 800,000 Vietnamese were re-settled in the US.<p>
<p>
The Vietnamese who return, known as "Viet kieu," contribute a large share of
the $600 million annually that flows from the US to Vietnam.  Many are in their
20s and 30s, and use family ties to cut through Vietnam's red tape.  There is
also a return of the elderly, some of whom are able to buy or build the nicest
homes in their village with US pension moneys.<p>
<p>
The Vietnamese exodus, which began in 1975, is finally coming to a close.
About 40,000 Vietnamese remain in camps in Hong Kong and elsewhere in Southeast
Asia, and only about 1,000 of these camp residents are expected to be accepted
by the US before the camps are closed in 1995.  Second, the Amerasian children
of American servicemen, who came to the US directly from Vietnam, has admitted
about 20,000 Amerasians and 60,000 of their family members, and is just about
over.  Third, the refugee program for 35,000 former political prisoners and
about 110,000 family members will end in 1995.<p>
<p>
Hong Kong and Vietnam have had some discussions about the repatriation of boat
people to Vietnam.  On December 16, Vietnam rejected 150 boat people released
from Hong Kong citing nationality problems.  Vietnam has affirmed its
commitment to both voluntary and forced repatriation of screened-out migrants
from Hong Kong, but said it will only accept legal Vietnamese nationals.
Britain would like to resolve the problem of Vietnamese migrants in Hong Kong
prior to 1997. <p>
<p>
Vietnam protested on December 12 what it called a "massacre" of Vietnamese
nationals in Cambodia by the Khmer Rouge, allegedly under the cover of the
Immigration Law approved by the Cambodian Parliament in August 1994.  The Khmer
Rouge responded that there are four million Vietnamese in Cambodia, and that
all should be expelled.  Cambodia has a population of about 10 million and a
GDP per capita of $250; Vietnam has 73 million people.<p>

Filipinos Deported from Taiwan</a></h2>
Taiwan deported 14 Filipino workers on December 27 for leading a strike at the
Far Eastern Textile factory in Chungli, which was a violation of their work
visas.  In Taiwan, persons who are not union members cannot strike.  <p>
<p>
The factory changed the way it repaid wage deductions unilaterally.  Like many
Taiwanese employers, Far Eastern opened a savings account for each foreign
worker, and deducted wages each month until NT$30,000 ($1150) was
accumulated--workers forfeit the moneys in the savings account if they
(unlawfully) seek new employment.  Instead of repaying the deductions with
interest in a lump sum, the factory decided to repay them in installments over
two months.<p>
<p>
There are believed to be 5000 illegal Filipino workers in Taiwan.  The
Taiwanese government has threatened to locate and deport those who do not leave
voluntarily before a crackdown scheduled to begin&nbsp;before the Chinese New
Year at the end of January<p>
<p>
Taiwan has experienced a sharp increase in the number of foreign workers
permitted to enter, but the Council of Labor Affairs Chairman argued that COLA
does not have the resources to manage these foreign workers.  About 12 staff
deal with the employers of 200,000 foreign workers.<p>
<p>
On December 19, the Industrial Development Bureau approved 18 new "major
investment cases" by companies deemed to have an urgent need to hire  foreign

investments in order to obtain priority to get foreign workers.<p>

<a name="RTFToC33">Illegal
Immigration into South Africa</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
There are an estimated two million illegal aliens among South Africa's 40
million population, giving the country one of the highest percentages of
illegal residents (five percent)--the US rate would be 1.5 percent if there are
four million illegal aliens present.  Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, South
Africa's Home Affairs Minister, blamed illegal immigrants for a crime wave
which he says has reached "almost unmanageable proportions."  South Africa,
which once had stringent border controls to keep out African National Congress
guerrillas, today has very relaxed entry controls, especially for travelers
arriving at night.<p>
<p>
The illegals include persons from nearby countries such as Mozambique,
Zimbabwe, Zambia and Angola; migrants from West Africa, who are reportedly
involved in smuggling, trading and using hard drugs; and people fleeing the
chaos in Rwanda.  Many Africans who arrive in South Africa as tourists apply
for residence permits once they are in the country.<p>
<p>
Some 57,333 aliens have been sent home between January and September 1994,
including 43,345 from Mozambique and 9,204 from Zimbabwe.  Some 93,600 illegal
immigrants were returned in 1993. <p>
<p>
Some in South Africa reportedly feel the need to accommodate "economic
refugees" after years of being responsible for destabilizing the region.  With
the unemployment rate running 42 percent for those 15 to 30-years old, the
government plans to tighten up border controls and stiffen penalties, including
jail sentences, on employers who hire illegal aliens.  Airlines that bring
passengers who do not have proper documents will also face fines.<p>

Australia is bracing for an influx of asylum seekers, including 20,000 from
southern China reportedly readying their exodus.  Many of these asylum seekers
are former residents of Vietnam who were forced to return to China.  <p>
<p>
Most illegal immigrants are detained until the Immigration Department has
decided whether to accord them asylum as political refugees.  Australia's High
Court decided that no applicant for asylum can be held in detention longer than
273 days.  Some applicants were held for two or three years, and the government
is considering paying them about $1 for each day there were held.<p>
<p>
Under new legislation, Australia does not grant asylum if the applicant has
already been refused recognition as a political refugee by another country.<p>
<p>
There are reportedly 80,000 illegal immigrants in Australia. Most arrived as
tourists or students and overstayed their visas.  <p>
<p>
Australia's 1994-95 immigration target is 73,000, a 16 per cent or 10,000
increase over 1993-94.  For 1995-96, the target will be 84,700.  Australia has
about 18 million people, and a 1992 average GNP of $17, 260.<p>

<a name="RTFToC37">The
Key to Europe</a>
</a></h2>
Widgren, Jonas.  1994.  The Key to Europe-a comparative analysis of entry and
asylum policies in Western Countries.  Available from ICMPD, Mollwaldplatz 4,
A-1040 Vienna, Fax-43-1504-46-7775.(1500 words)<p>
<p>
How should the world's leading region of emigration at the beginning of the
20th century deal with the fact that it has become the world's major
destination for immigrants at the end of the 20th century?<p>
<p>
This report, prepared for a Swedish Parliamentary Committee, provides a
valuable overview of immigration into Western Europe that stresses three major
points.  First, the number of persons entering Europe to settle there is at a
post-WWII high of about three million per year--despite all the talk of
Fortress Europe, immigration is up, not down, in the 1990s as compared to the
guestworker 1960s.  Second, about one-half of the annual entrants to Europe are
irregular family or economic migrants.  Third, there is a convergence in both
the reality and policies in all of the rich industrial democracies that asylum
processing must be speeded up, and persons who do not have a legitimate claim
to safe haven are removed promptly, and that more efforts must be made to
reduce illegal immigration. <p>
<p>
The starting point for the report is that immigration to Europe is ratcheting
upward, but that ever-larger immigration flows are not the answer to either
Europe's or the emigration countries' problems.  There are alternatives to
immigration to deal with Europe's demographic and economic problems, and more
children will make Europe "younger" much quicker than even massive immigration.
Second, the immigrants without much education arriving in Europe today may not
do well, given structural changes in the economy.  Third, immigrants are
changing the character of Europe's major cities, threatening to create in them
an underclass that will make downtowns there like US inner cities.<p>
<p>
The report outlines five phases of postwar European immigration.  The first
phase, from the end of WWII to 1964, was marked by the belief that free
movement was mutually beneficial in the evolving "United States of Europe," and
some 500,000 migrants per year moved across borders for at least temporary
stints abroad.  The second or guestworker phase from 1965 to 1972 saw over one
million foreigners per year arriving as probationary immigrants.  The theory
was that, at the  end of their one or two year contracts, they would be rotated
home to their country of origin, and then replaced by another Italian or Turk
if there was still a demand for unskilled labor in northern European factories
and construction sites.<p>
<p>
The third phase from 1973 to 1982 saw numerous efforts to encourage the return
of settled guestworkers ant to restrict the entry of more foreigners.
Immigration fell to about 700,000 annually.<p>
<p>
The fourth phase, from 1983 to 1989, saw an average 1.2 million foreigners
arriving, and many asked for asylum in Europe.  <p>
<p>
The fifth and current phase that began in 1989 is marked by 5 major streams of
migrants(1993 entries)<p>
--family unification(1.4 million), <p>
--asylum seekers and those seeking temporary protection from wars at
home(630,000), <p>
--the return of "citizens" to their countries of origin, as ethnic Germans to
Germany(242,000), <p>
--illegal immigrants(350,000)<p>
--and temporary workers(300,000).  <p>
The total number of entries peaked at almost three million in 1992, and was
reduced to about 2.6 million, excluding temporary workers, in 1993 by asylum
reforms in Germany and stepped-up efforts to reduce illegal immigration.<p>
<p>
Part II of the report provides country-by-country summaries of immigration
patterns since WWII.  Austria was converted from a transit country to a country
of immigration by guestworker recruitment and its attractiveness to asylum
seekers, so that the 700,000 foreigners in the country are nine percent of the
population.  Denmark's foreign population was changed by guestworkers and
asylum seekers from mostly Nordics to include more southern Europeans.  Finland
has traditionally been a country of emigration, but it has since 1990 begun to
receive asylum seekers--almost 4,000 in 1992.  <p>
<p>
Non-immigrant Germany is Europe's major country of immigration.  As in Austria
and Switzerland, guestworkers recruitment laid the basis for subsequent
immigration.  Most of the guestworker recruitment was concentrated in the four
years between 1968 and 1972, when the number of guestworkers rose from 1 to 2.6
million, and their share of the labor force rose from 5 to 12 percent.  German
efforts to reduce immigration were only short-lived successes, and its generous
asylum policy produced an estimated one million entrants to the former West
Germany in 1990.  Germany has revised its asylum policies, and offered
temporary worker opportunities to especially Eastern Europeans.<p>
<p>
France is Europe's traditional country of immigration, giving France one of the
easiest paths to naturalization.  France recruited guestworkers in the 1960s,
but under programs that were relatively inefficient, so that illegal arrival
and subsequent regularization of status became the norm.  This toleration of
illegal immigrants has produced in France several amnesties that were coupled
with tougher enforcement of immigration laws.  France in November 1993
toughened its asylum and immigration policies to make it easier to remove
failed asylum seekers and to make immigration more difficult.<p>
<p>
The same themes run through the other country studies.  In most, immigration
ratcheted upward despite policies designed to stabilize or reduce the foreign
population, and the frustration prompted sometimes significant changes in
immigration and asylum polices.  <p>
<p>
Perhaps the most useful part of the book is its sketch of the possibilities for
international cooperation to regulate immigration.  Immigration is probably the
most important international phenomenon that is not being coordinated by a an
international organization.  Imagine the confusion if trade in goods were dealt
with as are immigration flows--there would be no common definition or data, no
agreement on the costs and benefits of policy choices, and no organization to
enforce the rules laid down for nation-states. <p>
<p>
The report ends on the reminder that doing nothing is not a solution--the
problems of managing migration are likely to get more rather than less severe
over time.  European experience shows that, over the past 50 years, it has been
the form of immigration, but not the fact of immigration, that has changed in
response to government policies.  As countries change from active selection of
newcomers to coping with those who arrive, costs and frustration
mount--processing and caring for asylum seekers in 1993 cost $11 to $12
billion.<p>
<p>
Immigration is a major international challenge at the dawn of the 21st century,
as it was at the beginning of the 20th century.  The 20th century experience of
integrating European immigrants is today regarded as one of the major
achievements of North America.  Reports like this one can help European leaders
to ensure that their efforts to manage migration will be viewed favorably 100
years from now.<p>
<p>
The European Institute organized a December 12 discussion of European-American
immigration experiences, and Widgren there emphasized that there is in Europe
today a (false) sense that immigration has been dealt with successfully.  The
number of asylum seekers is down, East-West migration has been channeled
largely into temporary worker, ethnic citizen, and petty trader outlets, and
the threat of anti-immigrant political parties seems to have faded.  But
significant problems remain.  There could yet be a wave of refugees from
Eastern Europe and the ex-USSR, and the tensions between freedom of movement
and border controls within the EU could prove to be very divisive.<p>
  <p>
The facts speak for themselves.  The richest 15 percent of the world's
population--the 828 million residents of what the World Bank calls the 22
high-income countries--accounted for almost 80 percent of the world's $23
trillion GDP in 1992.  Their share of the world's population is shrinking,
while their share of world GDP has risen since 1970.  The result are huge gaps
in wages and incomes--an average person's income can be 10 or 20 or 40 times
larger in one of the high income country.  The result, not surprisingly, is
migration pressures, as the three revolutions of the past
generation--communications, transportation, and rights--make it easier to learn
that the grass is greener abroad, get to another country, and then stay
there.<p>
<p>
There was general agreement that managing mass migrations would be a major
challenge to governments in the 1990s and beyond, but little sense of where
policy makers should jump into the migration issue.  Some stressed the need to
prevent mass refugee movements by preventing war.  Others suggested that
immigration countries might look at their own policies to see what magnets are
attracting refugees.  Some stressed the need to deal with alien smugglers who
are profiting handsomely by taking advantage of differences of 10 or 20 to one
in wages, while others thought it more important to learn how to deal better
with immigration emergencies, as occur when Albanians set out for Italy or
Haitians and Cubans for the US.  Finally, some want to attack the root causes
of migration, which might imply much more aid and trade with emigration
countries and, at least in the short run, more emigration from them.<p>
<p>
In the search for transatlantic solutions to the common problem of managing
migration, it was noted that there is a fundamental difference between dealing
with goods and people.  People crossing borders are far more complex than even
the most sophisticated computer that is traded, but there is also another
difference--there is agreement that trade in goods should be as free as
possible, and estimates of the benefits of freer trade.  Europe and North
America do not yet have common migration goals, and there is no consensus on
the benefits and costs or open and closed borders.  <p>
<p>
Perhaps the fundamental problem is that people are ever changing, so that there
are few timeless principles in managing migration.   <p>

<a name="RTFToC2">Devaluation
and Mexico to US Migration</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Avoiding increased Mexico-to-US unauthorized migration due to recession in
Mexico and a wider US-Mexican wage gap was a pillar argument in favor of the
Clinton Administration's proposal to provide $40 billion in Congressionally
approved loan guarantees to Mexico.  The loan guarantee proposal was withdrawn
on January 31, 1995, and replaced with a package of aid that does not require
Congressional approval.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Mexico's peso hit a record low of US$1=6.55 on January 30, 1995, down over
40 percent from the $1=3.45 pesos on December 20, 1994.  After the announcement
of the aid program, the peso rebounded to $1=5.75 pesos.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Many in Congress wanted to make the loan guarantee conditional on Mexico
cooperating with the US to reduce illegal immigration.  Although the aid
package has no formal side conditions on immigration, US officials reported
that there was an "understanding" that Mexico would cooperate with the US to
manage migration.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>President Clinton, among others, argued that the Mexican aid package would
"help us to better protect our borders."  The 1982 peso devaluation of 72
percent<b> </b>was followed by a 30 percent increase in apprehensions in 1983
and 1984, from about 1 million to 1.3 million.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Legal and unauthorized Mexican migration to the US, which averaged about
300,000 settlers and 800,000 to two million sojourners per year over the past
decade, is expected to increase as a result the peso devaluation and hard times
in Mexico.  The US Treasury originally predicted 30 percent or 430,000
additional illegal entries in 1995--implying a "normal" flow of 1.4 million
unauthorized Mexican entries per year-- if the US did not provide aid to
Mexico.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The Treasury Department based its estimates partially on research by Tom
Espenshade, a Princeton demographer, who used INS apprehension data to estimate
that a 40 percent peso devaluation would increase illegal entries by about
460,000 annually.  However, most of these additional illegal Mexican entrants
would probably not settle in the US--the estimated increase in the settled
illegal Mexican population would be only about 40,000, implying that the US
loan guarantee would have provided $1 million for each settled illegal Mexican
migrant avoided.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Treasury assumed a 1 to 1 linkage between the peso and emigration, meaning
that a 1 percent devaluation would be follows by a one percent increase in
illegal immigration.  Most migration researchers were unwilling to be so
precise, and few believe that the relationship between the peso and emigration
is linear.  INS Commissioner Doris Meissner, for example, says only that
emigration pressure will increase.  Village economic modeling by UCD Professor
Ed Taylor finds that a 10 percent devaluation in the 1980s was associated with
18 percent more emigration, but a 30 percent devaluation increases exits from
Mexican villages of persons headed for the  US by 25 percent.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Not everyone agrees that the peso devaluation will immediately increase
unauthorized Mexico-to-US migration.  Mexican migration expert Jorge Bustamante
noted that coyotes set the cost of being smuggled into the US in dollars, and
that some potential migrants may not be able to accumulate 30 percent more to
pay smugglers immediately.  Michael Teitelbaum of the Commission on Immigration
Reform noted that the increased value in Mexico of the $3 to $4 billion in
remittances from US migrants may make potential migrants better off, if
Mexicans in the US continue to remit at the same levels and inflation in Mexico
does not offset the effects of the devaluation.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Along the US-Mexican border, there are reports that apprehensions and
attempted illegal entries rose in January 1995, but it will be several months
before it can be determined whether reports of increased unauthorized
border-crossings reflect the peso devaluation and hard times in Mexico or
represent reactions by the usual flow of unauthorized migrants to INS border
control efforts.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>There is general agreement that the migration effects of the peso
devaluation will not become apparent until March or April 1995, when seasonal
migrants seek US jobs.  These migrants will have to elude a beefed up Border
Patrol to enter the US illegally.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Emigration pressures and migration flows will also depend on economic
prospects in Mexico and California, the destination of most illegal Mexican
immigrants.  On January 3, 1995, Mexican President Zedillo made a speech that
laid out plans to deal with the economic crisis that caused the peso to lose
over 30 percent of its value in the last two weeks of 1994.  The theme of the
speech was sacrifice and austerity--wages and prices are to rise slower than
inflation, the government will try to sell off more public enterprises, and
government spending is to be cut.  On January 17, 1995, the Zedillo government
and the opposition parties signed a political reform agreement designed to
minimize political unrest by ensuring honest elections, thus restoring the
confidence of foreign investors.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>A sluggish Mexican economy in 1995 could increase both internal migration
to the northern border areas and emigration pressure.  The Mexican economy is
expected to grow less than one percent in 1995, inflation is projected to be 15
to 20 percent, and some foreign investors may put at least a temporary stop on
plans to build or expand factories and stores, slowing job creation.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The lower wages and costs wrought by the peso devaluation should make
Mexico more attractive to foreign investors.  Indeed, there has already been US
interest in shifting to unused maquiladoras in the border areas plastics and
other light-assembly work to take advantage of Mexican wages and benefits that
have fallen from $2 hourly to $1.50 [about half of these wage costs are payroll
taxes and benefits].  Since labor markets in Mexican border cities are fairly
tight, such an expansion of maquiladora activity should attract internal
migrants to the border.  If the California and US border economies improve as
expected in 1995, there could be more stepping-stone migration across the
border. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>There is no doubt that Mexico will, over the next two decades, emerge as an
important low-cost manufacturing center of North America.  But no one knows
exactly when and how this economic transformation will occur.  At least two to
three million of Mexico's five to six million farmers, plus their families, are
likely to leave the land over the next two decades, but it is not clear whether
foreign investment will create jobs for them in central Mexico or in border
areas, or whether many will migrate to the US.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Unlike fast-growing Asian nations, Mexico's 1990s boom was fueled largely
by foreign savings.  An overvalued peso made imports of both capital and
consumer goods cheap, and could be sustained as long as foreigners believed
that Mexico truly was the next "tiger."  In effect, US and other foreign
investors lent money to Mexico, and Mexicans used these foreign savings to buy
US goods--it is in this manner that the US Treasury can assert that $40 billion
in US exports to Mexico supports about 800,000 US jobs.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>A report released last week by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas estimated
that the peso devaluation will reduce American exports to Mexico by $10 billion
or 20 percent in 1995 versus 1994</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Mexico has learned that foreign money has an easy-come, easy-go quality.
The country achieved more than four percent economic growth-- 4.5 percent--only
in 1990.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>An "orderly" peso devaluation was advocated by the Mexico's new finance
minister during the summer of 1994, but ex-President Salinas reportedly wanted
to be one of the few recent Mexican presidents to leave office without a
massive devaluation.  When the government that took office on December 1,
announced its economic plans, local and foreign investors saw that the $30
billion trade deficit would not be reduced in 1995.  With the Mexican Central
Bank running out of reserves to support the peso, they bet that Mexico would
have to de-value its currency, which it did (MN, Jan 1995).  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The peso devaluation should help to create jobs in Mexico's tourism
industry, third largest after oil and manufacturing.  In 1994, an estimated 17
million US residents visited Mexico, and accounted for about three-fourths of
Mexico's $7.5 billion tourism revenues.  Globally, 528 million international
tourists spent $321 billion in 1994.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>During the 1980s, Mexico managed to keep its unemployment rate low despite
depression and economic restructuring--the  official urban unemployment rate
(desempleo abierto) for Mexico fell after 1983, reaching a low of 2.6 percent
in 1991.  Mexico's unemployment rate is low because it measures only persons
separated from formal job relationships, and because "unemployed" persons not
eligible for UI are pushed into marginal jobs and considered employed.  The
unemployed in Mexico are persons who can afford to search for work full
time--usually better educated and more affluent workers.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The Clinton aid package for Mexico is not popular--79 percent of those
surveyed in one poll opposed it and, near the end of January, groups ranging
from Ross Perot's United We Stand to Prop 187 supporters promised to work to
defeat Mexican aid.  </tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC3">President
Clinton Endorses Registry</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>President Clinton, in his State of the Union address on January 24, 1995,
emphasized the need to step up efforts to reduce illegal immigration.  Clinton
endorsed the recommendation of the Commission on Immigration Reform to test a
national registry to better prevent unauthorized aliens from obtaining US jobs
[the SAVE system is already in place to prevent unauthorized aliens from
obtaining public benefits].  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>In September, 1994, the CIR recommended that pilot projects in the major
immigration states experiment with a computer data base that includes Social
Security Administration and Immigration and Naturalization Service data.
Employers might call a toll free number, and then obtain a confirmation code
that the worker's Social Security Number or INS-A number is valid, eliminating
the need for an I-9 form.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Civil rights groups oppose the registry because they believe it would
increase discrimination and invade privacy.  They also believe that it is one
step closer to requiring a national identity card.  The AFL-CIO Executive
Council endorsed the registry, but withdrew support for the current employer
sanctions system based on employers seeing worker documents and completing I-9
forms because it allegedly increases discrimination against minority
workers.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The INS on January 6, 1995 announced plans to add 2,365 employees
nationwide, including 1,200 additional Border Patrol and port of entry agents
to "do something that has never been done before, which is to secure a border
that has never been secure."  By the end of 1995, the Border Patrol is expected
to have over 5,000 agents, and there is talk among Congressional Republicans of
doubling the Border Patrol to 10,000.  Attorney General Reno announced that
beef-up-the-border enforcement efforts have succeeded in stemming illegal
immigration, with apprehensions in San Diego down an estimated one-third from
the same months last year.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>As border controls are reinforced in El Paso and San Diego--where 65
percent of all apprehensions are made-- apprehensions in Arizona doubled to
almost 140,000 in FY94.  There was an especially significant increase in
apprehensions of East Europeans and Asians, suggesting that smugglers believe
that it is easiest to slip high-paying non-Mexicans into the US over the
Arizona border.  Attorney General Reno recently announced that the number of
Border Patrol agents in Arizona would be increased by 30 percent.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Most of the Arizona border crossing activity is between the twin cities of
Nogales, Arizona (pop 25,000) and Nogales, Mexico (pop 250,000).  There has
been a tradition of border crossing between these cities, but as the Arizona
border has become the preferred crossing point, violence has increased.  Tunnel
kids living in cross-border sewer tunnels are accused of leading illegal
immigrants into the US and robbing them, prompting the formation of a
US-Mexican police force to deal with border violence.</tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC4">Immigration
in the 104th Congress</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Immigration is not in the "contract with America" to which House</tt><p>
<tt>Republicans have promised to devote the first 100 days of Congress, but
Rep. Lamar Smith (R-TX ) and Senator Alan Simpson (R-WY) are expected to hold
hearings and get their immigration committees to approve legislation early in
the 104th Congress.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Smith reportedly plans to introduce a national version of California's
Proposition 187, while Simpson on January 24, 1995 introduced legislation (S
269) that would create a three-year five-state pilot verification program.  The
President would be required to institute an improved verification system within
eight years.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Simpson's proposal builds on a 1994 bill that also called for increased
funding to add border patrol agents and investigators, and to streamline
exclusion and deportation proceedings.  It includes stiffer penalties for
document fraud and alien smuggling, and would repeal the law allowing immediate
asylum for Cubans.  Simpson will wait until the CIR releases its study of legal
immigration in June 1995 to introduce a bill reducing legal immigration.
Simpson has advocated a five-year 25 percent reduction in legal immigration,
currently set at 675,000 annually. <b></b></tt><p>
<tt><b></b></tt><p>
<tt>Although some speculate that Republicans may try to make controlling
immigration a partisan issue, as Governor Wilson allegedly did by endorsing and
campaigning for Prop. 187 in California, both Smith and Simpson have said that
they want to continue the tradition of dealing with immigration in a bipartisan
manner.  Both favor a better worker verification system, and more efforts to
prevent illegal aliens from receiving social services.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>House Republican leaders initially proposed to bar legal aliens from 60
federal programs to save money ($22 billion over five years) and to avoid
alleged abuses, as when children sponsor the immigration of their elderly
parents, who then depend on SSI and Medicare from the moment they become
eligible until they die.  Senator Simpson and many Republican governors opposed
barring legal aliens from all federal programs. A January CNN/USA poll reported
that 62 percent of Americans want to eliminate virtually all benefits,
including education, for unauthorized aliens.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Welfare--federal means-tested assistance-- plays a special role in this
debate.  AFDC-- a $16 billion per year program that makes payments to 14
million people or five percent of the US population at a cost of about one
percent of the US budget--was created during the 1930s so that World War I
widows could stay home with their children.  However, today almost 60 percent
of all women with children under eight are in the labor force, making the
notion of paying women to stay home with children less acceptable.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>About the same numbers of babies are born today as in the early 1960s, but
today one-fourth, versus one-tenth in the early 1960s, are born out of wedlock.
The current welfare system seems especially unable to serve as a bridge to the
labor force for single mothers.  In 1992, 39 percent of AFDC recipients were
Black, and 34 percent were white.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>On January 9, House Speaker Newt Gingrich said that House Republicans may
"revisit" the issue of eliminating benefits to legal immigrants in light of an
announcement by Republican governors that they would be willing to accept a
five-year freeze at current federal levels in the block grants devoted to
welfare programs, which would save about $40 billion over five years according
to Gingrich.  Gingrich endorsed the current ban on benefits for illegal
immigrants as the "least destructive" way to save scarce federal funds.
</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>One compromise is to deny eligibility for benefits for the first few years
after arrival, and then enforce sponsorship agreements to deal with problems
such as those involving elderly immigrants and Supplemental Security Income.
One-fourth of the recipients of SSI in the US are legal immigrants.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Republicans would prevent the children of immigrants from bringing their
parents to the US to retire on the SSI program, and encourage these elderly
immigrants to become US citizens.  The CIR, in contrast, recommended that
children who sponsor the entry of their elderly parents be required to sign
binding pledges to support them so that they will not need SSI and other
government programs.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>On January 27, the House Judiciary Committee approved legislation that
would reimburse states for the costs they incur to incarcerate illegal aliens,
who are an estimated 14 percent of California inmates.  California would
receive $400 million under the legislation.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>A Newsweek poll found that 60 percent of all Americans think that
additional immigration  would be "bad for the country," spawning proposals to
reduce admissions of, or benefits available to, legal immigrants.  Among the
many proposals are bills introduced by Senator Jesse Helms (D-NC) and Rep
Robert Torricelli (D-NJ) to deny immigrant visas to persons who illegally own,
rent or manage American-owned property abroad.   The intent is to put pressure
on countries such as Cuba, Nicaragua, and Honduras, where American property
that was confiscated is now being used by persons who want to make business
trips to the US.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Representative Ron Packard (R-CA) introduced three bills that he described
as "a three-pronged attack [on illegal immigration]... shore-up our resources
at the US-Mexico border; close the inland checkpoints; and deny taxpayer-funded
benefits to illegal immigrants."  Packard's bill would double the number of
Border Patrol agents from 5,000 to 10,000 within five years. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Representative Bob Stump (R-AZ) introduced on January 4, 1995 the
Immigration Accountability Act of 1995, which would prohibit the payment of
federal benefits to illegal aliens and stop automatic citizenship for the
children of illegal aliens born in the US.  This bill would also limit
immigration to the spouses and minor children of US citizens, "legitimate"
refugees, and persons waiting to immigrate legally for 10 or more years.
</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Sen. Richard Shelby (R-AL.) reintroduced a Immigration Moratorium Act on
January 6.  The bill places a five-year moratorium on most categories of legal
immigration, and would reduce legal admissions by two-thirds, from the current
900,000 per year to 325,000 annually.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC5">Haitians
in Guantanamo Returned</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>On December 29, 1994, the US informed the 4,400 Haitians at Guantanamo that
they would have to return to Haiti, and that those agreeing to return by
January 5 would receive an $80 payment.  Only 677 Haitians--about 1 in
6--accepted the offer.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>On January 5, the US began to return the 3,900 Haitians who had rejected
the payment offer.  Upon their arrival in Haiti, the first 54 were given $15
and taken to the Port-au-Prince bus station.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Several US immigration advocates criticized the return of Haitians, arguing
that the US has neither the legal or moral right to return Haitians.  The US
and Haiti signed an agreement in 1981 that permitted the US to intercept on the
high seas and return to Haiti Haitians seeking to go to the US by boat; that
agreement expired in 1994.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Since President Aristide was restored to power October 15, 1994, over

<a name="RTFToC6">Farm
Labor Shortages and Guest Workers</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Farmworkers, maids, and janitors are the only three US occupations with one
million or more workers in which most workers are immigrants, and many new
entrants to these work forces are unauthorized aliens.  The combination of the
INS's Operation Gatekeeper and Prop. 187, plus calls by California Governor
Wilson and former Mexican President Salinas, has led to speculation that there
may be serious discussions in 1995 about a temporary US-Mexican program that
would admit farm and perhaps other workers.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Martin Anderson of the Hoover Institute, and former domestic policy advisor
to President Reagan, recently called for large "guest-worker programs, under
which foreign nationals who wish to work in the United States could do so
lawfully, with dignity, with no threat of being hunted down and deported."
According to Anderson, "Once upon a time we had such a program -- and we had no
illegal alien problems."</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Frank del Olmo, deputy editor at the Los Angeles Times, believes illegal
immigration could be controlled if the US negotiates an agreement with Mexico
to open US borders to workers as long as they register with the proper
authorities.  Their return to Mexico could be guaranteed by withholding 25
percent of their pay until they return to Mexico. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The devaluation of the peso is expected to increase Mexico-to-US migration
in 1995, but some farm leaders are nonetheless predicting farm labor shortages.
For example, the chairman of Tri-Valley Growers, a cooperative of 650 fruit and
vegetable growers, predicted that a labor shortage would force up wages in 1995
for the 32,000 workers in nine processing plants.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>US farm employers can request permission to bring into the US temporary
foreign farm workers under the H-2A program.  In 1993, DOL certified that
17,162 farm jobs could be filled by temporary foreign farm workers, and in
1994, 18,939.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>In the early 1980s, California farmers led the drive against the then H-2
program, arguing that perishable crop farmers could not make hiring plans
according to H-2 requirements.  Farmers won in IRCA a special agricultural
worker legalization program, and a replenishment agricultural worker program
that would have permitted foreign workers to enter the US in the event of farm
labor shortages.  </tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC7">Minimum
Wages, Jobs, and Immigration</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>President Clinton, in his January 24th State of the Union address, called
for a hike in the minimum wage which is currently $4.25 per hour.  The US
Department of Labor estimates that 2.5 million workers are paid the minimum
wage, and that another 1.7 million are paid less than $4.25 because they e.g.,
receive tips.  Two-thirds of the roughly four million minimum wage earners are
adults over 25, and many are immigrants.  Another 5.5 million US workers earn
$4.25 to $4.75 per hour.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Economic theory predicts that a higher minimum wage means fewer jobs, so
economists view minimum wage hikes as a trade off between jobs and wages at the
bottom of the labor market.  Similarly, theory asserts that more immigrants
means more US jobs, but lower wages and worse conditions in immigrant-dominated
labor markets.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>But this trade-off between wages and jobs is relatively small in the US
economy, which offers 125 million jobs.  Most studies agree that a 10 percent
increase in the minimum wage would lead to about one percent fewer jobs, so
that raising the minimum wage from $4.25 to $5, or 18 percent, would reduce the
number of minimum wage jobs from about four million to 3.9 million.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Rep. Lamar Smith (R-TX), chair of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on
Immigration and Claims says that "a sizable minority of illegal immigrants work
for significantly more than the  minimum wage."  He asserted that about 15
percent of illegal alien workers are in the construction industry, where wages
average $9.50 per hour. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>"As the economy becomes more high-tech, more and more lower skilled workers
compete for fewer jobs... The answer is to increase wages to make those jobs
more attractive to Americans.  It is unfair to American workers to allow
illegal aliens to directly compete with them for scarce jobs." </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>According to Smith, the "displacement factor" ranges from one-to-three to
one-to-six, meaning that, for every three to six illegal aliens employed, one
American worker is displaced.</tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC8">Illegal
Overstayers and Criminal Aliens</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>More than half of the estimated four million illegal aliens believed to be
in the US in October 1994 arrived legally as visitors or students and then
stayed in the US too long or violated the terms of their visas, usually by
working.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>There were estimated to be 2.1 million overstayers, and 1.9 million aliens
who entered without inspection (EWI).  About 150,000 overstayers and 150,000
EWIs settle in the US each year, increasing the illegal alien population by
300,000 annually.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Some 22 million foreign visitors enter the US each year, but only 600 of
the 39,000 deportations in 1993 resulted from visitors who overstayed.  [Most
illegal foreigners depart voluntarily after being detected.]  Foreign visitors
are presumed to want to settle in the US unless they can prove to US consular
officers abroad that they have sufficient ties to their home countries, plus a
round trip ticket, to make them likely to return.  For nationals of the 22
countries in the visa waiver program, only a round trip ticket is required to
visit the US. Countries from which it is estimated that more than 100,000
aliens entered as legal visitors and then settled illegally include Mexico
(357,000), Poland (107,000), Philippines (106,000), and Haiti (102,000).</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The Ironbound section of Newark has reportedly been settled by illegal
Portuguese immigrants, many of whom arrived on tourist visas.  There are
estimated to be 17,000 illegal Portuguese in New Jersey, and the Portuguese
enclave in Newark developed after the 1974 military coup in Portugal.  The
Portuguese today are about 40 percent of the area's 40,000 residents, and their
presence is attracting Portuguese-speaking Brazilian immigrants.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>On January 12, the ABC News program Day One aired a segment on the INS's
failure to detain and deport immigrants who had committed crimes and served
their sentences in the US.  Day One estimated that there were 500,000
foreign-born persons in jail or on probation in the US, or about 2.5 percent of
the 23 million foreign-born persons in the US.  After their release from
prison, most criminal aliens can be deported.  The INS in 1993 deported about
20,000 of the 200,000 criminal aliens in the US subject to deportation.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Both Day One and a New York Times profile of bounty hunters employed by
bail bondsmen to track down fugitive criminal aliens were critical of the INS's
failure to locate easy to find criminal aliens who have been ordered out of the
US.  If an alien is charged with committing a crime in the US, he or she is
entitled to due process and a public defender at trial.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>If convicted, there is another hearing--about half the time in jail--at
which a convicted criminal alien can "show cause" why he or she should not be
deported from the US.  In most cases, the alien will be ordered deported unless
he or she can show mitigating circumstances, such as a US citizen family and,
if the hearing is held in jail, the aliens being deported will be taken
directly to a bus or plane upon their release.  At a mid-December hearing of
the CIR, some argued that criminal aliens facing deportations should have
public defenders appointed to represent them (MN, Jan 1995), although few
thought Congress would approve such an expenditure.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Because the INS can detain only 6,000 aliens nationwide, some criminal
aliens released from prison are ordered to post a bond that guarantees they
will show up for deportation hearings.  Many fail to show, but reporters found
it easy to find the criminal aliens who failed to surrender.  The INS argues
that it does not have sufficient resources to detect and detain criminal
aliens, although bounty hunters in New York allege that, in some instances, INS
refused to accept criminal aliens brought to their offices because they had no
more room to detain them, or the INS would have had to find travel documents in
order to get them into their country of citizenship.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>On January 9, Senator William Roth (R-DE) introduced legislation to
facilitate the apprehension, detention and deportation of criminal aliens.  The
legislation, S179, or the Criminal Alien Control Act of 1995, streamlines the
deportation process for criminal aliens by, among other things, requiring
aliens who are not permanent residents and who wish to appeal deportation
orders, to do so from their home countries, after they have been deported.  The
legislation further streamlines the process by allowing state and federal
judges to order the deportation of criminal aliens.  </tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC9">Prop
187 Aftermath</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The Wilson Administration continues to draft regulations to implement Prop.
187.  On January 27, the Wilson Administration sued to have the
constitutionality of Prop. 187 determined first in California state courts,
thereby removing the case from a Los Angeles federal judge who has issued an
injunction blocking Prop. 187's implementation.  The governor's suit asks a
federal Court of Appeals to permit a state court to determine Prop. 187's
validity.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>News reports in January 1995 reported that, while fearful, unauthorized
immigrants' lives in California are "returning to normal."  Clinics report the
usual number of patients, and immigrant activists report that they do not know
of any unauthorized immigrants who have left California because of Prop. 187.
</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>As before the election, reports of "mixed families" illustrate how
difficult it would be to enforce Prop. 187's provisions.  For example, in many
households, the father is a legal immigrant, the baby is US born and a US
citizen, and the mother and older children are unauthorized.  In such a family,
issues arise about who gets services?  Do privacy laws protect the unauthorized
members of the family when legal members seek services, or when the
unauthorized mother seeks services for her US citizen baby?</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>There are estimated to be 950 illegal aliens among the 320,000 students
enrolled on the 20 campuses of the CSU system, and on January 17, 1995, a
California appeals court ruled that they must pay an additional $5,000 per year
out-of-state tuition, ending the practice since 1985 of charging them in-state
tuition.  This ruling means that all three of California's higher education
systems--University of California, California State University, and community
colleges--charge unauthorized aliens higher out-of-state tuition.  There is as
yet no Prop. 187-type system in place to verify the legal status of California
students.  California institutions of higher learning enroll about 1 in 6
college students in the US.   </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>In December 1994, the National Coordinating Committee for Citizenship and
Civic Participation met in Arizona and adopted the Plan de Tucson to boycott
California food, tourism and entertainment industries.  Corporations targeted
include Chevron and Disney, which report no effects on their businesses.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Some Mexican officials reportedly fear a return of unauthorized Mexicans
because of Prop. 187.  There is no evidence of such a migration.</tt><p>

<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Fifteen states across the nation are being targeted for Prop.-187 style
measures to deny public services to illegal immigrants.  Florida, with an
estimated 400,000 illegal aliens, is considered ripe for a Prop. 187-type
initiative, primarily because the state allows initiatives.  Texas does not
permit initiatives.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>A citizen's group in Florida has begun fundraising and petition drives
aimed at qualifying the measure for the ballot.  In Arizona, AZ-187 Border
Blockade, a Tucson political action committee, is planning to put a Prop.
187-measure on the 1996 ballot.  Arizona Governor Fife Symington was opposed to
California's Prop. 187, and there are currently no immigration control bills in
the Arizona Legislature.  </tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC11">Immigration
and Affirmative Action</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Many of the grassroots supporters of Prop. 187 have become vocal supporters
of the California Civil Rights Initiative, an initiative planned for the 1996
ballot that would "prohibit the state or any of its political subdivisions from
using race, sex, color, ethnicity or national origin as a criterion for either
discriminating against, or granting preferential treatment to, any individual
or group in the operation of the state's system of public employment , public
education or public contracting."  Governor Wilson lent his support to the
effort to repeal race and sex preferences with an end-of-the-year comment that
he favors ending California's affirmative action laws.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Early polling indicates that the proposal to end preferences based on race
and sex has a 50-50 chance of voter approval even if white women vote against
the initiative.  In one commentary, the same California voters who pioneered
the tax cutting fever of the late 1970s and 1980s are in the 1990s voting for
laws that get tough on criminals with three strikes, get tough on illegal
aliens with Prop. 187, and now get tough on preferences with the California
Civil Rights Initiative.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The California Legislature may attempt to head off the initiative with a
partial repeal of preferences in contracting.  Assemblyman Bernie Richter
(R-Chico) has proposed legislation for a so-called "colorblind society" that
would, inter alia, eliminate race and gender preferences in university
admissions and public employment and end the practice of requiring a certain
percentage of public contracts to be awarded to e.g., women, minorities, or
disabled veterans.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Some of the groups that supported Prop. 187 are also challenging the $40
billion aid package for Mexico and arguing that the renamed "America" needs a
"refounding amendment" that would, inter alia, restrict US citizenship to
"those born of an American."  The opposition to Mexican aid links the Prop. 187
groups with Ross Perot's United We Stand organizations.</tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC13">DOL
Issues H-1B Final Rules</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The final regulations spelling our what US employers wishing to hire
foreign H1-B workers went into effect January 20, 1995.  The US Department of
Labor regulations are designed to prevent US employers from paying below
standard wages to temporary skilled foreign workers.  DOL decided to limit
labor condition applications (LCA) to single occupations, but DOL has not
limited them geographically (e.g., only to areas within the jurisdiction of a
single DOL regional office). </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>There is an annual cap of 65,000 H-1B foreign workers with "specialty
occupations"--often engineers or physical therapists who have at least a
bachelor's degree.   In FY 94, DOL approved employer requests for 60,179 H-1B
workers, versus 61,591 in FY 93 and 57,125 in FY 92.  The INS  reports that
there were 110,000 H-1B workers in FY 92, and 93,000 in FY 93, but the INS data
report each entrance of such a worker, so that, e.g., a UK software engineer
who takes a summer vacation in England and then returns to the US is counted
twice in INS data.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The new rules also affect contractors who move H1-B workers from job to
job.  A new "time test" allows employers to shift an H1-B worker to a worksite
not listed on the LCA for 90 days without filing a new LCA.  To stem abuse, DOL
requires that there be no strike at the particular worksite, that the work be
the same for which the approval was granted, and that the off site work be less
than 90 work days over three-years.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Employers of H1-B employees will now be required to notify DOL within three
days if a strike or lockout occurs at particular place of business.  DOL
enforcement powers will be significantly increased, the agency to conduct
investigations on its own initiative instead of waiting for complaints.
</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Labor groups, especially US software engineers, welcomed the new rules.
But software companies such as Microsoft and Intel and their lawyers complained
that the new rules make it too hard to bring in needed foreign workers.
</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>In many cases, these "brand-names" American companies use a subcontractor
to supply them with foreign workers, so that they may not know of substandard
wages and conditions.  The Department of Labor decided "at this time" not to
establish special procedures for companies that obtain foreign workers through
contractors.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The new rules reduce the maximum length of a work permit from six to three
years, and require US employers to offer more evidence that they are indeed
paying prevailing wages to foreign workers.  However, most of the employer
application continues to consist of attestations--meaning that the employer
asserts that Americans are not available for the jobs foreigners will fill, and
that the wages and conditions offered are normal for the occupation.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>One of the arguments for the 1990 IMMACT was that the US needed to make it
easier for scientists to immigrate because, according to a National Science
Foundation report, there would soon be a shortage of everything from
biochemists to mathematicians.  Many universities expanded their Ph.D.
programs, and the number of scientists grew almost three times faster than the
labor force as a whole.  There were 402,000 workers in all fields of science in
1992, including 53,000 biomedical scientists.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Real federal funding for scientific research has been frozen at about $57
billion since 1987, and as a result, more newly minted Ph.D.'s are scrambling
for ever fewer secure jobs.  The unemployment rate for scientists, three
percent, is the highest for any US profession, and many new Ph.D.s shuttle from
one $20,000- $35,000 post doctorate to another.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>As US students sought alternative careers, universities filled up their
graduate programs with foreign students.  Today, there are more foreign than US
born post-doctorate scientists, 17,000 versus 16,000, while in 1979, there were
two US-born post-doctorates for every foreign born post doctorate.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The number of foreign-born scientists continues to increase.  In 1993, the
Chinese Student Protection Act allowed the 27,000 Chinese students who were in
the US during the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre to become immigrants.  Many
are believed to be scientists and engineers.  The US allocates 140,000
immigrant visas annually for needed workers, including scientists, and about 30
percent of the 50,000 to 60,000 immigrant workers admitted--15,000 to 20,000--
are believed to be scientists (the remaining visas are used for family
members).  </tt><p>

have made English their "official language."  </tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC16">Integration
of Muslims in France</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>France, Europe's major country of immigration, has long followed a policy
of encouraging conformity to French values in public.  This has provoked a
series of so-called hidjab or headscarve battles--Muslim women who wear
headscarves have been barred from French schools for wearing "ostentatious"
religious objects.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The headscarves, in turn, reflect the growth of Islamic fundamentalism,
especially among second and third generation North African youth in the suburbs
who have had a hard time finding jobs and careers in high-unemployment France.
In these suburbs, youth allegedly have two choices, both of which make the
French uncomfortable--adopt secular values, and be attracted to drugs and
delinquency, or become devoutly religious, and perhaps be attracted to Islamic
fundamentalism and terrorism.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The estimated three to five million Muslim immigrants in France make Islam
second only to Catholicism in adherents among France's 57 million people.  Many
observers call for compromise, and accommodation is often made for religious
differences, but there are also reports of e.g., Muslim workers being
disciplined for asking for work breaks to pray. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>There were many laudatory profiles of French Interior Minister Charles
Pasqua after hostages aboard an airplane hijacked in Algeria were released in
southern France.  Pasqua expelled several fundamentalists from France during
the summer of 1994, and he reportedly takes care to cultivate the mainstream
Muslim population in France.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>A French writer compared the dissatisfaction of the French and Californians
with illegal immigration, noting that, in France, foreign workers, legal or
not, are accused of looting French society by taking advantage of generous
social services, disregarding French values and cultural habits, and raising
the crime rate.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Presidential candidate and National Front leader Jean-Marie Le Pen has said
he would expel million of immigrants if he won the French presidential
election.  During a speech announcing his candidacy for the April 1995
election, he said, '"I pledge an immediate end to all immigration and to send
three million immigrants home." </tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC17">German
Citizenship Changes Proposed</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Germany's Justice Minister, Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger, has called
for a reform of the country's 1913 citizenship law that makes citizenship
dependent on blood rather than place of birth.  The CDU-CSU-FDP coalition that
won the October 1994 election proposed a conditional citizenship for the
children of immigrants who have lived in Germany for at least 10 years--at age
18<b>, </b>the child would have to choose German or his parents'
nationality.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Kohl's Christian Democrats continue the affirm their ardent opposition to
dual nationality or anything that would liberalize current immigration policy.
The proposed bill threatens to drive a wedge between the FDP and the Christian
Democrats (CDU) weakening the center-right coalition government. The proposal
is very close to the position of the FDP, the small party that helps maintain
Kohl's slim 10-seat parliamentary majority. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Germany's major opposition party, the Social Democrats (SPD), voted
unanimously on January 24 to offer a nationality bill that would make dual
nationality possible, cut the naturalization period, and automatically grant
citizenship to third-generation immigrants.  The Social Democrats argue that
the bill will help the 6.9 million foreigners integrate better.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Germany's nationality laws are based on blood or decent rather than place
of birth.  The proposed law would entitle children of foreign parents to German
nationality if one parent was born or lives in Germany.  Allowing retention of
another nationality would benefit the 1.8 million Turks.  Some have been
deterred from naturalizing because they feared losing inheritance rights in
Turkey.  The CDU believes that the new law would send the wrong message and
open the flood gates to further migration to Germany.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Of Germany's 80 million population, about 6.5 million are foreign born, and
nearly 60 percent of the foreign-born have lived in Germany for more than 10
years.  Many gained residence rights through the once liberal asylum process.
According to the Interior Ministry, 127,210 foreigners applied for asylum in
1994, compared to 322,599 in 1993 and 438,191 in 1992.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Some 222,600 ethnic German immigrants arrived in Germany in 1994, compared
with 218,900 in 1993 and 230,600 in 1992.  About two-thirds of the immigrants
came from Asian republics such as Kazakhstan, but other ethnic Germans are
re-settling in Russia.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>On January 11, 1995, Germany announced that it would begin to forcibly
repatriate some of the 40,000 Vietnamese illegally in the country, and Vietnam
has agreed to accept them back in exchange for a $130 million aid package and
$65 million in risk insurance for German companies making investments in
Vietnam.  This works out to about $5,000 for each Vietnamese to be sent
home.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>There were about 62,000 Vietnamese in East Germany in 1989, and 12,000
stayed despite a German offer of a ticket home plus $2,000.  The 40,000 illegal
Vietnamese include 20,000 rejected asylum seekers.</tt><p>

Rules Asylum Detention Illegal</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Home Secretary Michael Howard is seeking to have overturned a ruling that
asylum seekers cannot be deported from the UK before their claims are heard,
nor can they be detained while their requests are considered.  Immigration
lawyers and Amnesty International are demanding the immediate release of up to
500 immigrants currently being held in custody.  Howard says he will continue
to hold the asylum seekers until the appeals courts tells him to release them.
</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The ruling was a result of a clause inserted in the Asylum and Immigration
Appeals Act of 1993 which says that no asylum seeker will be sent home until
consideration of his or her request for safe haven has been completed will end
the British practice of detaining illegal aliens and asylum seekers who entered
the UK illegally.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>

Combats Xenophobia</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The advisory committee on racism and xenophobia established by the European
Council in Corfu recommended in an interim report that European schools and
training programs make special efforts to meet the needs of minority youth,
that the media make a special effort to combat racism and xenophobia, and that
EU nations take steps to ensure that "all legal residents ... have equal access
to</tt><p>
<tt>employment and fair treatment from employers."  A final report is expected
in April 1995.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Spain, France and Italy fear influxes of immigrants from Northern Africa,
while Germany worries more about immigrants from Eastern Europe.  At a December
summit meeting in Essen, Germany, EU leaders agreed on a $6.7 billion aid
package for Eastern Europe over the next five years, with the understanding
that the amount might have to be raised later.  The European Commission, the
union's executive body, had recommended $8.5 billion.  Although there was some
discussion of giving the Mediterranean countries roughly half the amount
offered to the East, in the end the summiteers were unable to settle on a
figure.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The Council, the European Commission, and a delegation of the Forum of
Immigrants of the EU on January 30 discussed asylum and refugee requests,
freedom of movement, reuniting of families and visitation rights, the right
work in another member state, and racial discrimination and citizenship.  The
Forum asked the EU to allow immigrants living illegally in the Union for more
than three years to be allowed to legalize their situation under a general
amnesty. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>France holds the presidency of the EU in the first six months of 1995,
followed by Spain and Italy at the start of 1996.  This is expected to
highlight the problems of immigration into southern Europe.  The European
Commission is committed to giving both direct aid and wider market access to
North Africa.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Spain's EU development commissioner, Manuel Martin, has said that the EU
should consider how to deal with immigration and drug trafficking, but it is
unclear whether African countries will agree to try to halt emigration and drug
trafficking in return for aid. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>There is also some dispute about the type of aid to be given.  Germany and
Britain prefer trade concessions over aid.  One the other hand, Southern
Europeans prefer aid to trade, since they fear their economies would be hurt if
cheaper textiles and agricultural products. </tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC20">Dutch
Amnesty</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>On January 31, 1995, the Dutch Senate was expected to decide whether to
adopt a controversial amendment taht would prevent persons from applying for
asylum if they entered the Netherlands via a safe third country.  If approved,
asylum seekers entering the Netherlands from Germany, Belgium or another safe
country would be deported back to that country.  The amendment was narrowly
approved by the lower house of Parliament in December.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The bill is opposed by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
and Amnesty International because they feel it would make it difficult to
protect asylum seekers.  The Dutch Refugee Council estimates that, under the
proposed law, as many as 40 percent of all new asylum seekers would not be
allowed to apply. The Netherlands received about 55,000 requests for asylum in
1994. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Beginning January 1, 1995, illegal immigrants in the Netherlands who can
prove they have had legal work continuously for at least six years, paying both
tax and social premiums, are entitled to an official residence permit.  The
amnesty will continue until January 1, 1999.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC21">Alien
Smuggling in Europe</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Migrant trafficking is believed to be a billion dollar business in Western
Europe, as smugglers who once smuggled drugs now sneak an estimated 500,000
illegal aliens into Europe for fees that range from $250 to $25,000 each.
Smuggling foreign workers is both more profitable and less risky--in the
Netherlands, for example, alien smuggling became a crime only in January 1994,
and is punishable by a maximum of one year in prison.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>There are both supply and demand reasons for the surge in migrant
trafficking.  War and poverty, plus knowledge of opportunities abroad,
encourage migrants to seek jobs abroad.  At the same time, there are
opportunities to earn 10 or 20 times more in Europe than at home.  Border
control officers complain that, even if they think they know who is smuggling
aliens, arrests can be made only when smugglers are caught with aliens, and
smuggling is not always considered a serious crime because, within the EU,
there is no consensus on whether to treat migrants being smuggled into Europe
as criminals or victims.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>

Portugal-- and two north African nations--Algeria and Tunisia-- met in Tunis

<a name="RTFToC24">Chinese
Migration</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>China is hoping to expand its labor exports to find jobs for its estimated
120 to 125 million unemployed rural workers.  Beginning in the 1950s as
"foreign labor cooperation," China has sent workers abroad to complete 1,000
projects in 70 countries, most notably the railroad between Tanzania and
Zambia.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>After economic reforms in 1978, China began to promote the export of labor
as a means to earn foreign exchange and to ease domestic unemployment.  Three
major types of government entities--national government corporations, local
government companies, and trading companies--and today there are 130,000 to
200,000 Chinese workers abroad, mostly in Asia.  The Ministry of Foreign Trade
and Economic Cooperation, which reports 200,000 migrant workers were abroad in
1994, estimated that remittances and earnings from Chinese-supplied materials
used in foreign projects generated $8 billion for China in 1994.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>There are two major arrangements under which Chinese workers are employed
abroad.  Labor service agreements, most often made by one of the 61 local
government companies, sent 68,000 workers abroad in 1991.  Contract-tied
workers, most often employed by one of the 56 national government corporations
that have a contract to build e.g., a dam or bridge abroad, sent 21,500 workers
abroad in 1991.  There are reportedly 30,000 Chinese workers employed to build
Hong Kong's new airport and to work in construction there.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>There are also Chinese "worker-trainees" in Japan, ex-USSR, and the US,
Chinese farmers in Japan, and 10,000 Chinese workers in South Korea.  China is
asking Japanese and Korean construction firms to consider using Chinese workers
when they win jobs in third countries, such as the Gulf states.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Over half of all Chinese workers come from 10 of China's 30
provinces--about 20 percent come from the South China provinces of Guandong and
Fujian.  These provinces are among the fastest growing in China, and they are
the preferred destination for some of the 60 million Chinese who re-settle
every year within China, and the 20 million who migrate to seasonal jobs within
the country.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>China has 1.2 billion people, 80 percent of whom live in rural areas.
Despite an economy that expanded by 12 percent in 1994 to about $520 billion,
and $35 billion in direct foreign investment in 1994, second only to foreign
investment in the US, there are an estimated 150 million surplus workers in
rural areas, and 15 to 20 million un- or underemployed workers in urban areas.
By 2010, even if the population remains at 1.2 billion, it is predicted that
half of the country's people will live in urban areas, implying a massive
rural-urban migration and large cities.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Relatively better conditions in the urban areas of the country--industry
expanded by 18 percent in 1994, versus four percent for agriculture--accentuate
inequalities that promote rural-urban migration.  There are an estimated 50 to
60 million internal migrants within China.  They are described as so-called
'mangliu' ('blind migrants'), since they gather at railroad stations looking
for jobs and fellow villagers, much as southern European guestworkers did
France and Germany in the 1960s.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>These internal migrants have rapidly made for themselves a place in local
economies, but they also threaten social unrest.  For example, most of
Beijing's 800,000 construction workers are reportedly internal migrants, but
these migrants are also 43 percent of the convicted criminals in Beijing.
Migrants also dominate occupations such as maid, peddler, and food-stall
operator.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The Chinese government is trying to manage rural-urban migration by
limiting the employment of rural migrants in urban factories and expanding
labor exports abroad.  As China relaxes the household registration system, some
cities have begun to tax newcomers for the right to change their registration
from rural to urban, thereby making available to them the permits they need to
get local government housing.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The Year of the Boar, which begins January 31, 1995, is expected to see
millions of internal migrants return to their villages with gifts--last year,
almost one in six Chinese traveled by rail in the two months of the lunar New
Year.  China hopes in 1995 to keep 60 percent of the internal migrants at their
workplaces to avoid overloading the transportation system by encouraging
employers to offer overtime and bonuses, and prohibiting them from hiring new
migrant workers until 30 days after the holiday season.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>China is planning a national campaign at the start of 1997 to help prevent
a mass influx of mainlanders into Hong Kong after the sovereignty handover.
The current  entry procedure for mainlanders to visit and stay in Hong Kong
would be kept intact after 1997.  Currently, 105 immigrant visas are issued
each day for mainland immigrants to Hong Kong.  There are reports that
mainlanders are asked to pay up to $300,000(HK) for these permits.</tt><p>

Foreign Workers</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Malaysia is a fast growing country of 20 million people that both exports
and imports labor.  It has one of the highest immigrant worker shares in the
region--an estimated one million foreigners in a workforce of about eight
million, and persisting employer complaints of labor shortages.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Foreign workers in Malaysia include over 61,000 professionals or
expatriates who earn at least R1200 ($500 ) per month.  There were also 563,000
unskilled and semi-skilled foreigners with Temporary Visit Work Passes in
September 1994.  Over half of these foreign workers, who receive two-year work
permits that are renewable for one year-- were in the Kuala Lumpur area, and
about 30 percent were employed on plantations, 30 percent in construction, and
20 percent as maids.  For the 340,000 legal foreign workers for whom country of
origin data are available, two-thirds are Indonesians, followed by 20 percent
Bangladeshis.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Beginning in 1993, Malaysian employers were required to pay an annual levy
on each foreign legal worker.  The levy varies from about $120 for plantation
workers to $170 for construction workers and $350 for skilled service workers.
Since April 1993, there has been a freeze on employer applications to bring
additional foreign workers to Malaysia, but a cabinet-level Task Force
considers and approves applications for foreign workers on a case-by-case
basis.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Malaysia is attempting to rapidly upgrade its economy, thereby eliminating
jobs that might be filled by unskilled workers.  Malaysia's Sixth Five year
plan projects shortages of skilled and surpluses of unskilled workers by 2000.
The Malaysian government has asked private employers to do more to train the
skilled workers expected to be in short supply.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Malaysia is now trying to attract overseas investors with tax and other
incentives, but is choosy about the type of industry allowed in the country.
The government is aiming for capital-intensive projects such as semi-conductor
manufacturing. </tt><p>

reports that the government cannot control the influx of illegal foreign
workers into the country.  The Advisory Council for National Labour Development
will be investigating workers from Myanmar (formerly Burma) in the Thai fish,
construction and husbandry industries.  Along the Myanmar-Thai border, nearly
all the workers are from Myanmar migrants. </tt><p>

laborers in Thailand.  A recent study by the Social and Population Research
Institute estimated that there were 520,000 illegal foreign workers in

Kong Emigrants Return from Canada</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Over the past two years there has been a noticeable increase in the number
of Hong Kong citizens returning to Hong Kong after emigrating to Canada.  Some
of the reasons for returning include lack of servants, job shortages, high
taxes, and separation from friends and relatives.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Emigration from Canada, usually after the immigrant has obtained Canadian
citizenship, is estimated at about 15 per cent.  Increasingly, Hong Kong
citizens are emigrating to Australia, London, Singapore, and Europe.  Hong Kong
has been losing 60,000 people per year, or about one percent of the population.
</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The brain drain of middle level management worries the government in Hong
Kong.  The British offer of citizenship to 50,000 families -- which could mean
250,000 people -- may be the first immigration scheme in history aimed at
keeping people in their homeland rather than helping them leave.  The theory is
that once a Hong Kong resident gets British citizenship, he or she will feel
secure enough not to leave.  Foreign citizenships are being offered to people
Hong Kong least wants to lose, such as mid-level managers, business
entrepreneurs, those with vital skills, such as air traffic controllers, and
people with "sensitive jobs," such as police chiefs.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>A judge in Hong Kong has ruled that the government is guilty of illegal
detention of Vietnamese boat people.  At least 125 boat people could be
released following the January 26 ruling that long periods of detention in

Korea Sets Up Court for Foreign Workers</a>
</a></h2>
<tt>In March 1995, South Korea will create a court to deal exclusively with the
problems of foreign workers, such as wage issues and severance pay.  One reason
for creating the court was to deal with increasingly frequent worker protests,
such as one staged by 13 Nepalese workers outside Seoul's Myongdong Roman
Catholic cathedral until the Korean Federation of Small Business (KFSB) agreed
to their demands.  The Nepalese thought they would earn<b> </b>$400 to $500<b>
</b>monthly and receive technical training. But the agency offered them only
$210 monthly when they arrived in South Korea.  The KFSB promised to pay these
workers directly rather than through their agency.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>A private consulting body has also been created to assist the South Korean
government with the management of foreign workers. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Small businesses employ about 18,000 foreign workers and another 10,000
will soon be invited to work in country.  There are between 50,000 to 100,000
foreigners working illegally in the country.   </tt><p>

People to Australia</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Australia is expecting an influx of as many as 5,000 boat people, according
to a worst-case scenario by the Department of Immigration.  Australia's
detention camps are already full, with 1,000 boat people who arrived in 1994.
The President of the Indochina Refugee Association indicates that the
Australian government does not have much confidence in talks with China on how
to stem the flow. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Over 700 persons repatriated from Hong Kong to China have turned up on the
northern shores of Australia since mid-November.  Most are Vietnamese who fled
Vietnam fearing persecution and were granted asylum in China in 1979. With the
assistance of the United Nations they set up homes in Beihai and are now
leaving in boats for Darwin.  In Australia, most requested asylum on the basis
of China's one-child policy.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>China has told the Australian government that it is under no obligation to
take back the Vietnamese-Chinese boat people.  The Chinese blame the exodus on
the Australian government decision to grant refugee status to former Vietnamese
refugees in 1994. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Australia places those who arrived in detention camps.  The UNHCR endorsed
Australia's warning that these boat people would not be granted asylum.  China
announced that the one-child policy does not apply to ethnic minorities or
refugees such as Vietnamese and Laotians granted refuge in China, and Chinese
police are reportedly arresting persons attempting illegal emigration and
confiscating their boats.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Legislation will be proposed in the Australian Senate to make it more
difficult for the boat people to seek refugee status.  The legislation has been
announced to send a message back to Beihai, that the chances of successfully
finding refuge in Australia are poor. </tt><p>

<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Africans--from Zambia, Angola, Mozambique, and Zimbabwe--are migrating to
South Africa.  The African National Congress-dominated coalition government,
facing elections in October 1995, is under pressure from mainly black trade
unions and workers to step up border controls in order protect jobs for local
workers. The ANC wants to avoid alienating neighbors who harbored its
guerrillas during the struggle against apartheid.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The South African government today uses random ID checks and raids on
suspected ''safe houses'' to detect and deter illegal immigrants.  According to
one survey, most South Africans favor even more immigration controls.  A recent
survey reported that a majority believed that illegal aliens should be rounded
up and deported.  However, many of those apprehended say they will try to
return, since the wage gap between South Africa and Mozambique is 10 or 15 to
1.  The main rail station in Johannesburg serves as South Africa's major day

<tt>There are believed to be two million aliens in South Africa.  About 53,000

<a name="RTFToC33">Fiji
Opens Door to Chinese Business Migrants</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>After the 1987 coup in Fiji, more than 24,000 Indian Fijians left the
country fearing persecution.  The Fijian government is now inviting Chinese
business migrants to come to Fiji to fill the void left by the Indian
professionals and entrepreneurs who left.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The Fijian Cabinet approved a proposal to allow up to 7,000 Chinese
businessman and their families from Hong Kong to migrate to Fiji, provided they
pay an application fee of $30,000 and invest at least $100,000 in
government-approved projects.  The government says the program will bring in up
to $ 2.5 billion in investments and create some 80,000 jobs.  The Chinese are
expected to be heavily involved in repacking and refining import commodities
for re-export.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The 1990 constitution favors indigenous Polynesians over Indians, who make
up nearly half of Fiji's 770,000 people.  It bars non-natives from becoming
president or premier, and reserves 37 parliamentary seats for indigenous
Fijians, 27 for Indians, and five for other groups under the General Voters
category. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Current estimates are that there are about 5,000 Chinese in Fiji.  While a
few settled in the islands a century ago, some 1,000 Chinese, have come to do
business in Fiji in the last few years. More than 900 work permits have been
issued to Chinese nationals since 1987, and the Fiji Trade and Investment Board
says there are nearly 60 Chinese running joint ventures in Fiji.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Official figures show that between 1987 and June 1993, Fiji granted
citizenship to 508 Chinese.  During the same period, 24,014 Indians left the
country for Australia, New Zealand and Canada.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC2">Clinton's
Budget Targets </a></a></a>Illegal
Immigration</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a> 
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>President Clinton's proposed federal budget for 1996, released February 6,
1995, includes a $1 billion increase in immigration-related spending, raising
it from $2.6 billion in FY 95 to $3.6 billion in 1996.  Most of the additional
funds would go to the INS, which would see its budget rise 27 percent to $2.6
billion, to prevent illegal entries and to detect and deport unauthorized
aliens in the US.  </tt><p>
<tt>There were an estimated four million illegal aliens in the US in October
1994, and their number is believed to be increasing by 300,000 each year, or
25,000 per month.  About 40 percent of these settled illegal aliens are
Mexicans.  An average 2,000 to 2,500 aliens are apprehended daily along the
US-Mexican border.</tt><p>
<tt>Clinton's budget would add 700 Border Patrol agents to the current 5,000
and provide $300 million to states to cover their costs of incarcerating
criminal aliens, $100 million to reimburse states for the costs of educating
illegal alien children, and $150 million to reimburse states for the costs of
providing emergency medical services to unauthorized aliens.  California alone
is requesting $3 billion from the federal government, and other states are
demanding $5 billion more.</tt><p>
<tt>The administration is also proposing steps to speed up the deportation of
aliens who have been convicted of crimes in the US.  There were 37,000 criminal
aliens deported in 1993, 22,000 in 1994, and the administration is expected to
increase criminal deportations to 58,000 in 1996. </tt><p>
<tt>There are an estimated 77,000 criminal illegal aliens in federal and state
prisons.  If they are released before being deported, many fail to leave the
US--about 20 percent of those ordered deported are released before receiving a
final deportation order.  There are believed to be about 100,000 illegal aliens
who have been convicted of crimes in the US, served their sentences in the US,
been ordered deported, but are nonetheless here.</tt><p>
<tt>Senator Simpson's immigration control bill (S269) gives the president eight
years to establish a system to verify the eligibility of every new worker hired
and every applicant for public benefits.  Simpson's bill directs the attorney
general to establish a data base that could be used to establish eligibility.
The cost of establishing such a registry has been estimated at $3 to $6
billion, primarily to clean up the Social Security and INS data bases.</tt><p>
<tt>Under Clinton's original proposal, some of the additional immigration
control funds would have been raised by a $3 per car and $1.50 per pedestrian
border entry fee at the 169 border crossings between the US and Canada and
Mexico.  There were 409 million legal land entries into the US in 1993, and the
fees were expected to raise $200 million in 1996, and then $400 million per
year.  </tt><p>
<tt>The border crossing fee had supporters and detractors in Congress.  Over 20
border-area Congressmembers<b> </b>released a letter asserting that a border
crossing fee would in fact be a tax that would slow traffic and hurt border
businesses, contrary to the spirit of NAFTA.  According to San Diego critics,
Mexicans in the Tijuana area, many of whom now make trips to the US every two
to four days, would find it too costly and time consuming to enter.  Opponents
also assert that traffic congestion at ports of entry could worsen air
pollution there.  </tt><p>
<tt>Opposition from Canada and Mexico, as well as border state politicians, led
Clinton to withdraw the border crossing fee proposal on February 22.  States
will be given the option of adopting the border crossing fee and, if they do,
they will share the funds raised to do additional immigration control and
border infrastructure projects.</tt><p>
<tt>A representative for California Governor Pete Wilson said that Clinton's
proposals offer only a "Band-Aid solution" that ignores the passage of Prop.
187 in California.  An attorney for the Mexican American Legal Defense and
Educational Fund criticized the Clinton proposals for failing to provide funds
to promote of the naturalization of immigrants. </tt><p>
<tt>The House of Representatives, on February 10, 1995, approved by a vote of
380-20 revisions to the 1994 crime bill that expands the list of crimes for
which illegal immigrants can be deported, and speeds up their deportation.  The
Criminal Alien Deportation Improvements Act also includes provisions that raise
penalties for smuggling aliens into the US from today's average 18 months
imprisonment and $5,000 fine to up to 20 years in prison and triple<b>
</b>Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) damages, which could
total millions.</tt><p>
<tt>On February 25, the US Drug Czar announced that Operation Hard Line would
immediately prompt INS and US Customs to more frequently inspect cars entering
the US for drugs.  Some 80 US Customs inspectors will be transferred to the
US-Mexican border, and US helicopters will be permitted to take Mexican police
to places inside Mexico where drugs are loaded onto trucks headed into the
US.</tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC3">Budget
Bolsters Interior Enforcement</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>Clinton's FY 96 budget requests $93 million, a 29 percent increase, in
additional funds for interior enforcement.  Under a proposal to target
enforcement on industries and employers likely to violate labor and immigration
laws, Clinton's budget proposal calls for 365 additional INS inspectors to
double checks for illegal aliens in US workplaces, and 202 additional DOL wage
and hour inspectors to increase by 65 percent inspections in workplaces likely
to employ unauthorized workers, such as garment makers, construction firms,
agriculture and food services.  </tt><p>
<tt>These additional inspectors would be concentrated in the seven states with
the most illegal aliens--California, Texas, Arizona, New Jersey, New York,
Florida, and Illinois.  If the budget increase is approved by Congress, the
number of illegal aliens detected in the workplace is expected to double.
</tt><p>
<tt>In 1994, 1,400 of the 2,200 employers investigated by INS for hiring
illegal aliens were issued fines totaling $11 million; 4,400 investigations are
planned for 1996.  In 1993, when the INS had 318 sanctions enforcement agents,
it completed nearly 1,800 cases against employers that resulted in fines.
There was a backlog of 36,000 leads of employers possibly employing illegal
aliens in September 1994. </tt><p>
<tt>INS and DOL data report different levels of employer compliance with
checking on the legal status of all new hires and refusing to hire illegal
aliens.  The INS reports that 90 percent of all employers inspected are in
compliance, and DOL reports about 50 percent employer compliance.  INS data
reflect violations only after an employer has been given a chance to correct
mistakes, while DOL data do not.</tt><p>
<tt>Clinton's budget proposal would also permit a significant expansion of the
telephone verification system, whereby 200 employers in 1995 call in the Social
Security and immigration numbers of their new hires to INS.  The number of
employers using this system is expected to increase to 700 in 1996.</tt><p>
<tt>Clinton's proposal would also provide $28 million for a pilot worker
verification system.  The pilot worker registry would permit a test of several
ways to combine INS and Social Security data in major immigration states so
that employers could quickly verify a worker's legal status.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS is planning to reduce from the current 29 documents to 16 the
documents that workers can present to employers to establish their legal right
to work in the US.  An estimated 50 percent of all illegal aliens working in
the US present fraudulent documents to employers.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC4">Calls
for Guest Workers
Mount</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a</a></a></h2>
<tt>On February 6, 1995, California Attorney General Dan Lungren called for a
guest worker (companero) program that would permit Mexican workers to be "free
agent" workers in the US.  The workers would be protected in the US, according
to Lungren, by the right to change employers, and induced to return by having
10 to 25 percent of their US earnings deducted in a manner that they could
re-claim only upon their return to Mexico.  </tt><p>
<tt>Los Angeles Times editorial page manager Frank del Olmo argued in a January
31, 1995 Op-Ed in the newspaper that a guest worker program is the "least bad"
means to control illegal immigration.  He too called for withholding part of
the alien workers' pay to induce their return, and argued that the increased
sophistication of the workers and media attention would prevent abuses.</tt><p>
<tt>INS Commissioner Doris Meissner argued strongly against a guest worker
program, calling it a short-term fix that produces long-term problems and
distortions.  Meissner argued that guest workers are inherently exploitable,
and that the notion that a country can add workers to its labor force and not
residents to its population is fundamentally flawed.</tt><p>
<tt>However, agricultural interests in February 1995 made the rounds in
Congress, laying the groundwork for a proposal to introduce a non-H2A foreign
farm worker program.  Their success in securing an alternative to the then H-2
program in the early 1980s has led to speculation that farmers may be even more
successful in today's Congress.</tt><p>
<tt>A decade ago, when the ample supply of unskilled farm labor was threatened
by employer sanctions, the debate over guest workers centered on how to
determine whether there was a "need" for foreign workers, meaning that issues
such as how soon before workers were needed must the US employer request help
from the US Employment Service to find US workers, what wages and benefits had
to be offered to them, and how to handle complaints that US employers find
American workers unqualified.  The 1995 calls for guest workers, by contrast,
downplays whether foreigners are needed, and focuses on measures to assure that
any foreign workers admitted will in fact return to their countries of origin.
</tt><p>
<tt>Programs that aim to add workers to the labor force without adding
permanent residents to the population have produced one of the few "principles
of migration"--there is nothing more permanent than temporary foreign workers.
Countries initiate guest worker programs for four major reasons: to alleviate
labor shortages, to better manage inevitable migration, to provide
work-and-learn opportunities, and to promote socio-economic integration.  Guest
worker programs generate economic, migration management, and development
benefits, but they also create distortion costs in the labor importing
country's economy and labor market, as well as creating a dependency that leads
everywhere to some leakage from temporary to permanent settlement.</tt><p>
<tt>Past guest worker programs attempted to use rules and regulations to manage
economically-motivated migration that, in turn, changed the economies of
sending and receiving areas.  Asian countries are pioneering economic
instruments to manage migration, such as levying a tax on employers who hire
guest workers and requiring the guest workers to deposit 30 to 50 percent of
their earnings in savings accounts that they can reclaim only in their country
of origin.</tt><p>

Stepped-Up Border
Controls</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>The General Accounting Office (GAO) reported in January 1995 that INS
efforts to deter the entry of illegal aliens at the border rather than
apprehend them in the US seem to be working.  Beginning with Operation Hold the
Line in El Paso, followed by Operation Gatekeeper in San Diego and Operation
Safeguard in Arizona, the INS has installed steel fences along the border and
massed agents there to discourage attempted entries.  </tt><p>
<tt>In El Paso, there were 8,000 to 10,000 Mexicans entering El Paso daily in
December 1993, when the INS launched Operation Hold the Line by moving 400
agents to the border to try to prevent illegal entries.  Apprehensions have
since fallen by 73 percent, and the fence has been repaired and fortified to
become a formidable obstacle.  </tt><p>
<tt>In San Diego, by contrast, Operation Gatekeeper on October 1, 1994 sought
to push aliens attempting illegal entry from the western six miles of border to
the eastern 60 miles, where mountains and desert make detection and
apprehension easier.  Aliens were deterred at the western border by a fence,
lights, and then three tiers of Border Patrol agents.  Apprehensions first
fell, but rose by 18 percent in January 1995 versus January 1994.</tt><p>
<tt>Five Republican California congressman called for the Border Patrol to
abandon its three-tier strategy in San Diego and move all the agents to the
border, similar to the El Paso blockade.  The Border Patrol has begun moving
agents closer to the border as a visible deterrent, but Border Patrol officials
say their "push them east" strategy remains intact.  The Border Patrol argues
that a saturate-the-line approach would not work in San Diego because of the
terrain differences and the desperation of the crossers.  There is also concern
that this desperateness might lead to violence against Border Patrol agents.
</tt><p>
<tt>The GAO concluded that the prevention strategy reduced apprehensions,
crime, and Border Patrol-alien confrontations, and enjoyed strong public
support in the areas where it was tried.  In addition, INS believes that some
Mexicans in the interior of the country are deterred by reports of more agents
on the border.</tt><p>
<tt>However, there is also evidence that aliens attempting illegal entries may
have shifted from e.g., El Paso and San Diego to Arizona, where apprehensions
doubled between January 1994 and 1995.  There is also limited evidence that the
price of being smuggled into the US--often the most reliable indicator of
supply and demand in illegal markets--has risen, but not as much as might have
been expected--from $200 to $300 to be smuggled to Los Angeles to $250 to
$400.</tt><p>
<tt>There were 1.3 million apprehensions by the Border Patrol in FY93, and one
million in 1994.  The number of enforcement hours was stable at about 8.8
million. </tt><p>
<tt>The Mexican border crimes task force expects an average of 30,000 crossing
attempts per month.  Smugglers sometimes lead aliens on "banzai runs" up
Interstate 5 south of San Diego; 120 people have been killed since 1985 running
on or near border freeways in the San Diego area.</tt><p>
<tt>Along Mexico's southern border, a special operation will target the
smuggling of US-bound non-Mexicans. </tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC6">Legal
Immigration and Naturalization in 1994</a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>Legal immigration fell about 10 percent in FY 94, to 800,000 from 880,000
(excluding aliens legalized under IRCA).  There were 24,000 fewer
employment-based immigrants admitted, 15,000 fewer unmarried sons and daughters
of US citizens, and 21,000 fewer dependents of legalized aliens.  </tt><p>
<tt>Citizenship applications have increased dramatically, especially in the
five-county area around Los Angeles.  Government officials believe that a
combination of fear, convenience and increased political awareness are
responsible for the rise. There were 423,000 naturalizations in 1994, compared
to 314,681 in 1993.  </tt><p>
<tt>In California, more than 110,000 aliens became naturalized US citizens in
FY94, twice the usual number.  In Los Angeles alone, the Immigration and
Naturalization Service approved 13,259 applications for citizenship in October
and November 1994.  During the same two months of 1993, the Los Angeles
district, which includes Orange, Ventura, and Riverside counties, approved only
5,510 applications for naturalization.  </tt><p>
<tt>INS officials can interview no more than 600 naturalization applicants
daily,  which means that there is an average six month wait between filing
papers and participating in a naturalization ceremony.  Anyone who has been in
the US legally for five years is eligible to apply for US citizenship. Most of
the three million aliens who were legalized in 1987-88 under IRCA's
legalization programs now qualify to apply for US citizenship.</tt><p>

Devaluation, US and Mexican Jobs, and
Migration</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The Mexican peso fell from $1=5.4&nbsp;pesos on February 1 to $1=6 pesos on
February 28.  Many businesses in Mexico came to a near standstill because of
foreign-exchange losses, sales declines, and a loss of confidence.  By one
estimate, as many as 250,000 jobs, equivalent to 1 percent of Mexico's
employment, and 2.5 percent of formal sector employment, have been lost since
December.  Most of the auto companies in Mexico, for example, closed their
assembly lines temporarily because of expected sales declines of 30 to 50
percent in 1995; consumer durables sales are down as a result of consumer
interest rates of 60 to 70 percent.  </tt><p>
<tt>Many Mexican companies are expected to go bankrupt and lay off their
workers as the Mexican economy shrinks by perhaps two or three percent in 1995.
Some foreign investors that had announced expansions or new facilities in
Mexico put their plans on hold; total foreign investment in Mexico fell 22
percent in 1994, with most of the decline in the last 10 days of the year,
although direct foreign investment in factories and equipment rose over 60
percent.</tt><p>
<tt>Under the US  aid plan withdrawn on January 31, Mexico would have deposited
the roughly $7 billion per year it earns from oil exports in the US Federal
Reserve Bank, so that the US could keep the money if Mexico defaulted on the
loans that Clinton proposed.  However, Congress proved unwilling to approve the
$40 billion loan guarantee plan because it would allegedly also be bailing out
US and foreign investors who had pumped billions of dollars into Mexico.
Private capital flows to developing countries world wide have quadrupled since
1989, from about $40 billion to $160 billion in 1994.</tt><p>
<tt>The Dallas Federal Reserve Bank estimated that a 40 percent peso
devaluation would result in 20,000 to 30,000 lost US jobs, due both to lower US
exports to Mexico and increased illegal Mexican immigration.  The US exported
goods worth about $49 billion to Mexico in 1994 and, since each $50,000 in
exports is assumed to support one US job, this implies that about one million
US workers had jobs in 1994 that depended on exports to Mexico.  If exports to
Mexico fall by $10 billion in 1995, there would be 100,000 lost US jobs--actual
job losses would be less because some of the goods not exported to Mexico could
be exported elsewhere.</tt><p>
<tt>Some 36,000 US workers have filed claims with the US Department of Labor
asserting that they lost their jobs because of NAFTA-inspired trade increases.
In January, 24 members of the US House of Representatives sponsored a bill that
calls on the US to withdraw from NAFTA.</tt><p>
<tt>As apprehensions of illegal aliens increased, there continued to be
second-guessing on how much illegal immigration will be prevented by US aid for
Mexico.  Apprehensions were up in January in Texas and Arizona, and down in San
Diego.  Commentators such as Patrick Buchanan argued that adding just $1
billion of the aid to the US Border Patrol budget would do far more to prevent
illegal immigration than providing loans and loan guarantees.</tt><p>
<tt>Many in Congress had demanded that, as a condition of receiving US aid,
Mexico must "cooperate" with the US to reduce drug trafficking and illegal
immigration.  At the second meeting of the Bilateral Commission on February 13
and 14, 1995 in Zacatecas, Mexico pledged to double the Grupo Beta border
police unit that fights smuggling and drug trafficking on the Mexican side of
the border.  </tt><p>
<tt>Mexico also agreed to begin a joint pilot program to repatriate illegal
immigrants from San Diego to the Mexican interior.  In Texas, two new Grupo
Beta units will be formed and a struggling Grupo Beta unit in Arizona will be
reorganized.  Mexico also reorganized its National Migration Institute, and
announced that its migration policies would be based on the three principles of
border enforcement; immigration that benefits Mexico; and protecting the human
rights of all persons in Mexico regardless of their legal status.</tt><p>
<tt>Mexico strongly denied that it would block its side of the border to
prevent illegal migration to the US in exchange for aid.  Despite a provision
of the Mexican constitution that permits Mexicans to leave the country only at
authorized ports of exit, a Mexican official asserted that Mexican law
prohibits police from stopping persons leaving the country.<b></b></tt><p>

<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The General Accounting Office on February 2, 1995 released a report that
concluded that immigrants are twice as likely as US citizens received benefits
from the Supplemental Security Income and Aid to Families with Dependent
Children programs  in 1993.  Half of the immigrant recipients of SSI and AFDC
are in California, which had 38 percent of all immigrants in the March 1994
Current Population Survey (CPS).  Immigrants received an estimated $3.3 billion
of the $24 billion in SSI benefits in 1993, and $1.2 billion of the $22 billion
in AFDC payments.</tt><p>
<tt>Both the Clinton Administration and the Republicans "Contract with America"
would reduce the eligibility of aliens for these benefit programs.  Currently,
legal immigrants, refugees, asylum applicants, and certain other PRUCOL
(persons residing under color of law) aliens are eligible to apply for these
benefits.  However, US immigration law permits aliens seeking entry to be
excluded if they are likely to become a public charge.  An alien can pledge to
be self-sufficient by providing proof of sufficient personal resources, a job
offer that offers a sufficient wage, post a bond, and/or have a US resident
sponsor sign an affidavit that promises to support the alien if necessary.
</tt><p>
<tt>It is estimated that 90 percent or more of the family-sponsored immigrants
admitted to the US obtain bonds from US residents in which the US sponsor
promises to support the immigrant if he/she cannot support him/her self.
Several courts have ruled that these affidavits of support are not binding on
the US resident.  For this reason, sponsorship rules were changed to require
that, if a sponsored immigrant applies for SSI or AFDC benefits after arrival,
a portion of the sponsor's income and other resources will be "deemed" to be
available to the immigrant as part of their income in determining whether the
immigrant is eligible for benefits.  This deeming period is three years after
arrival for sponsored immigrants applying for AFDC, and five years for
immigrants applying for SSI.</tt><p>
<tt>The Clinton Administration's proposal would extend the deeming period for
both SSI and AFDC to five years, and maintain the eligibility for cash
assistance of current recipients.  The House Republicans proposal would, one
year after enactment, make all aliens ineligible for AFDC and SSI for six years
after their arrival, except for refugees and aliens 75 and older who have lived
in the US at least five years.</tt><p>
<tt>If access to benefits were restricted as proposed by the Clinton
Administration, program savings may be $1 to $5 billion annually; the House
proposal might result in program savings of $2.5 billion annually.  Savings
estimates are difficult to make because aliens denied federal benefits may turn
to state and local government programs, naturalize, turn to sponsors for
support, or not immigrate.</tt><p>
<tt>The IRS is checking the validity of claims for refunds that low-earners can
receive under the Earned Income Tax Credit.  The EITC is a negative income tax,
paying up to $306 to single workers, and $2,528 to a family with two or more
children.  About 15 million people in 1994 received $20 billion EITC on their
1993 earnings, including 2.2 million receiving $2.3 billion in California.  The
average payment nationwide is about $1200.</tt><p>
<tt>There has been a sharp growth in the number of Hispanic-surnamed persons
filing for EITC in California, prompting speculation that immigrants are
applying. Nancy Bolton of the UCLA Business Forecasting Project obtained data
on tax returns in 1989 and 1992, and found that there was a 12 percent increase
in the number of Hispanic households filing California tax returns, and that
their mean income fell by 13 percent to $20,629 in 1992.  Mean Asian household
incomes in California, by contrast, were $33,266 in 1992, and mean non-Hispanic
white incomes were $40,443.</tt><p>

to dismiss the challenge to the constitutionality of Prop. 187 or to stop
federal consideration of Prop. 187 until state courts rule on its
validity.</tt><p>
<tt>On February 8, 1995, a California state court issued an injunction that
prevents California colleges and universities from inquiring about the legal
status of the estimated 13,600 illegal alien students, most attending
California community colleges, until a full trial on Prop. 187's provisions is
held in June 1995. </tt><p>
<tt>On February 13, 1995, a<b> </b>U.S. District judge dismissed California's
lawsuit demanding $2.4 billion per year from the federal government for the

<a name="RTFToC12">British
Uproar over </a></a></a></a></a>Abolition of EU Border Controls</a></a></a></a> 
</a></h2>
<tt>On March 26, 1995, the seven signatories of the Schengen Agreement
(Germany, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxemboug, Spain and Portugal) will
abolish border controls between their countries.  Jacques Santer, president of
the EU Executive Commission, said that the EU continues to remain committed to
the free moment of people.</tt><p>
<tt>Britain heads the EU nations seeking to preserve national border controls,
for historic reasons that it traces to its island mentality and its tradition
of independence.  A junior minister in charge of British immigration affairs
brought the issue to a head in mid-February, when he resigned to protest the
possible loss of Britain's right to control entry over its borders. British
government lawyers reportedly asserted that the opt-out of no borders
negotiated by former Prime Minister Thatcher would not prevail if the European
Commission were to take Britain to the European Court of Justice.</tt><p>
<tt>Other government officials and Prime Minister John Major asserted that
Britain has the right to maintain border controls.  Major was particularity
upset that the junior minister raised the specter of millions of immigrants
flooding into the country.  European officials say that Germany, the richest EU
nation, is the real magnet for immigrants, not Britain.</tt><p>
<tt>Britain has seen the proportionately largest outflow of population to the
rest of the EU in the past 20 years.  British citizens are the largest
expatriate communities in Spain, Portugal, Ireland and Greece. The British
expatriate community in  France  has doubled since 1973,  from 25,000 to
50,000, and in Germany there are 100,000 Britons, more than ever despite a
declining military presence.</tt><p>
<tt>In part to offset fears of being swamped by immigrants, the British Home
Secretary announced on February 16 that an extra 12,000 asylum seekers per year
would be expelled from Britain, and that measures would be taken to streamline
the asylum process.  Eighty percent of the asylum applications are rejected,
five percent are granted refugee status, and 15 percent are granted exceptional
leave to stay on compassionate grounds.  The main countries of origin of
applicants in 1994 were Nigeria, Sri Lanka, Turkey and Ghana.  Most of those
who received asylum were from Iraq, Iran and Turkey.</tt><p>
<tt>The British Immigration Office disagrees with the number of immigrants
reported by the Home Office.  The Home Office says that the total number of
immigrants in 1993 was 55,640, only a slight increase over the 52,790 in 1992
and 53,900 in 1990. The number of immigrants who have been removed, either by
deportation or after formal warnings, also remained stable at about 6,000 each
year in the 1990s.  </tt><p>
<tt>The Immigration Office believes that these data understate illegal
immigration.  The Immigration Service Union believes that, including illegal
entrants would triple immigration to 150,000 per year. </tt><p>
<tt>Concern has been raised that the opening of the Eurotunnel has also opened
a new door for illegal immigrants into Britain.  Police have caught 120 illegal
immigrants since limited service began a few months ago; they are prepared for
a massive influx as service increases.</tt><p>
<tt>An important part of the Schengen agreement was the establishment of a
computerized database that will contain information on asylum, illegal
immigrants, and persons with criminal records.  Agreements that permit police
to pursue illegals across borders, and to request surveillance on suspects in
other countries, is scheduled to become effective in 1995.</tt><p>
<tt>With the implementation of the Schengen agreement, the German government
will supply an additional 500 border police to the southwestern state of
Baden-Wurttemberg.  According to the Baden-Wurttemberg Interior Ministry, 1,665
people were apprehended trying to enter Germany illegally from France in the
first eight months of 1994.  Most of the illegal immigrants  are Albanians from
Kosovo.  These numbers are expected to rise dramatically after March 26, when
border controls are abolished.  German officials are also concerned that
Islamic activists, in trouble in France, will seek shelter in Germany.  Some
Algerian fundamentalists already have a base near Cologne.</tt><p>
<tt>The IOM estimates that there are 1.5 to 3 million illegal or clandestine
workers in Western Europe, including 300,000 to 500,000 Albanians in Greece and
Italy, or 10 percent of Albania's labor force.  Most find jobs, sometimes with
the help of labor smugglers, in construction, agriculture, non-durables
manufacturing such as garments, and hotels and restaurants.</tt><p>
<tt>A report released on February 22 by the European Council on Refugees and
Exiles, "Safe Third Country, Myths and Realities," reports that EU member
countries are violating the Geneva Convention principle of "non refoulement."
The report claims that thousands of refugees are being expelled from the EU
every month without any attempt to hear their asylum case. </tt><p>
<tt>The ERCE General Secretary asserted that EU member-nations should not have
signed the London Convention in 1992 because it declares that asylum seekers
who travel through "safe" countries can be deported.  This may result in a
deportation chain, in which the asylum seeker is sent back to the country from
which he or she fled persecution. </tt><p>
<tt>According to the ERCE, in one six Somali nationals who arrived in Belgium
on May 29, 1994 were deported to the Czech Republic, then to Slovakia, and then
to the Ukraine, the first nation they transited.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC13">Dual
Citizenship Initiative Fails in Germany</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>The Green party in Germany's Bundestag introduced a bill to permit dual
citizenship, but they were unable to secure sufficient support to have it
considered seriously.  The bill would have granted German citizenship to
children born of settled foreigners in Germany, a position advocated by
government's commissioner for foreigners, Cornelia Schmalz-Jacobsen, who wants
naturalization laws now based on descent to be changed.</tt><p>
<tt>Currently, foreign children may apply for citizenship if one parent has
German citizenship. Otherwise, they may gain German citizenship by satisfying
residence and other requirements and by renouncing their citizenship of
birth.</tt><p>
<tt>Every year tens of thousands of people try to cross the Oder River
illegally that separates Poland and Germany.  About 60 percent of those who
cross the Oder are Romanians.  Most rely on smugglers (Schleppers) to sneak
them across the river. If the would-be immigrants are not detected by German
radar, hunting dogs, and helicopters, they will usually be led by a Schlepper
12 miles along a dirt road to Eisenhuettenstadt, and then to Berlin to find
work on building sites or in hotels and restaurants. </tt><p>
<tt>Being smuggled to Germany typically costs DM1,500 ($1,000), of which DM300
must be paid in advance, and the rest during the first few months of the
immigrant's stay in Germany, according to the Bundesgrenzschutz (BGS).  The BGS
is more concerned about a wave of immigrants from Russia, where passports to
travel abroad will be freely available after June, 1995, than the end of border
controls with Schengen.  Fewer than one per cent of the illegal  immigrants
apprehended apply for asylum.</tt><p>
<tt>For the second time, the German Interior Minister has extended its freeze
on the deportation of Kurdish refugees to allow a parliamentary committee
hearing on the issue.  Bonn would like to speed up deportations to discourage
asylum seekers, but it wants to ensure the safety of the Kurds in Turkey.  A
Turkish court recently imposed jail terms on eight Kurdish deputies for
comments they made in support of Kurd's in Turkey's  Parliament. </tt><p>
<tt>Norway continues to return Turkish refugees who have been denied asylum to
Turkey.  In 1994, 30 Turkish nationals, mostly Kurdish, requested asylum in
Norway.  Only one was granted asylum.  </tt><p>
<tt>Norway rejects most of those western Turkey, while those from southeast
Turkey -- where Kurdish separatists are fighting the Turkish army -- are most
often granted asylum.  There are large numbers of Kurdish refugees living in
makeshift camps around Istanbul and Ankara.  Human rights organizations do not
agree that Kurds are safe in around these Turkish cities. </tt><p>
<tt>In a ruling by the Court of the Justice of the European Union on February
14, 1995, Germany was ordered to change its method of taxing border commuters
and immigrants.  A Belgian national named Schumacker commuted to a job in
Germany, and Germany required him to pay taxes there as a single worker, even
though he was married and his wife was unemployed.  If he were considered a
German resident, his wife's status would have been recognized, and he would
have been able to deduct certain work-related expenses from his income.</tt><p>
<tt>The Germans argued that the discrimination against Schumacker was based on
residence and not on nationality, so that Schumacker could not challenge it
under Regulation 1612/68 of the October 15, 1968 on free movement of workers,
which stipulates in Article 7 that workers in one Member States who are
nationals of another are eligible for the same tax advantages as national
workers.  The Court found that "non-residents are usually non-nationals," so
that Germany's failure to take into account Schumacker's family situation in
levying taxes was a form of discrimination based on national origin.</tt><p>

<tt></tt><p>
<tt>On February 21, 1995, supporters of the National Front, while posting
campaign signs, killed in unclear circumstances a 17-year old son of an African
immigrant in Marseilles.  National Front leader Jean-Marie Le Pen deplored but
did not condemn the killing, possibly hurting his chances in France's
presidential balloting this spring.  The first election is April 23, and the
run-off May 7.  According to La Pen, his supporters are instructed not to put
up signs at night, and not to carry arms.</tt><p>
<tt>Interior Minister Charles Pasqua warned that the world faced a campaign of
destabilization by Muslim.  Pasqua called on "democrats" in Algeria to hold
firm.</tt><p>
<tt>French officials fear that the fall of the Algerian government might
produce a mass exodus to France.  The populations of Algeria, Morocco and
Tunisia are young--more than half their population are below the age of 25--and
have high  unemployment rates-- 50 percent in Algeria. <b></b></tt><p>
<tt><b></b>Income gaps between Europe and North Africa are widening.  In 1992,
per capita GDP in France was $22,260, versus $1840 in Algeria, $1030 in
Morocco, and $$1720 in Tunisia.  The populations of the Maghreb are projected
to grow from 60 million in 1992, about the same as France's 57 million, to 83
to 86 million in 2010. </tt><p>
<tt>French officials report that the number of people deported from France in
1994 rose 53 percent to 11,400; another 566 were expelled, at a total cost to
the French taxpayer $18 million.  According to the head of French immigration,
illegal immigrants, once mainly from the France's former colonies in Africa, in
1994 included nationals of Turkey, the former Yugoslavia, Romania, and even
China and Sri Lanka.  Increased illegal immigration is blamed on smugglers,
especially Asians, who supply illegal labor for leather and construction
industries. </tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC15">Immigration
in Austria</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>Freedom Party (FPO) leader Joerg Haider announced plans for a "Citizens 98"
movement to break the postwar grip of Austria's two mainstream parties.  The
Freedom Party, which got 23 percent of the vote in the October 1994 election,
wants to end immigration to Austria.  Haider has said that stopping illegal
immigration will be the central platform in his party's campaign to take power
in 1998, the next scheduled general election. </tt><p>
<tt>According to Haider, there are 250,000 illegal aliens in Austria, and "The
safety of our streets is directly linked to the problem of illegal aliens in
Austria."</tt><p>
<tt>Austria's immigration control problem stems primarily from its geography;
it has an easily crossed and unpatrolled border with Slovenia.  Austria joined
the EU January 1, 1995, and when Austria abolishes border controls with Germany
and Italy as part of the Schengen agreement, border controls with non-Schengen
nations will be increased.</tt><p>
<tt>Gypsies in Austria are the latest victims of racial terrorism in Austria.
On February 5, four of the 117 Gypsies in the small village of Oberwert, 75
miles south of Vienna, were killed by a pipe bomb hidden by a sign that read
"Gypsies Go Back to India." One day later, another bomb with the sign "Go back
to Dalmatia (a reference to a Croatian region) was found near a school. </tt><p>
<tt>A neo-Nazi group has taken responsibility for both bombs.  In 1993, the
Austrian government recognized about 5,000 of the estimated 20,000 gypsies in
the country as an official minority.  There are an estimated six million
gypsies in Europe. </tt><p>
<tt>The Austrian government has changed its quota of foreign workers from nine
percent to eight percent of a firm's employees.  An initiative was proposed in
the Austrian parliament in late January guaranteeing work permits to Bosnian
refugees and the foreign children of international managers, although the quota
of such permits for 1995 is already exceeded. At the same time, the number of
guest workers from the EU has already increased by 20,000; EU workers do not
need a permit in order to work in Austria. </tt><p>
<tt>The number of foreigners (workers, self-employed, family members,
pensioners) entering Austria is limited to 17,000 in 1995 (14,900 in 1994).

Mass Migration From
Russia</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></></a></a></h2>
<tt>When the USSR broke up, about 75 million citizens of ex-USSR nations lived
outside their republic of birth.  Some Russian leaders used the threat of mass
emigration as a means to induce Western nations to provide aid in the early
1990s.</tt><p>
<tt>However, the threat of mass migration from a region that had very high
rates of labor force participation and very low population growth was never
credible, according to some experts.  There is a steady emigration from Russia
of about 100,000 ethnic Germans, Jews, and Greeks each month, but Russia is a
net immigration area.  For example, so-called "shabai" are illegal Ukrainian
workers in Russia who work at Moscow construction jobs for up to $200 per
month, even though the prevailing local wage is just $50 per month.  However,
these illegal aliens in Russia have no residence permits and thus no access to
government housing or benefits such as health care.  </tt><p>
<tt>About three million of the estimated 25 million Russians outside Russia
have returned within the past three years.  For example, Kazakhs are only 40
percent of Kazakhstan's 17 million people, but with salaries only $25 per
month, and priority for "good" state jobs going to Kazakhs, many Russian
professionals think that their only hope is to emigrate. </tt><p>
<tt>The Ukraine and Russia dropped the issue of dual citizenship when they
signed a friendship treaty on February 8.  The Ukraine strongly objects to
Russian proposals that the Ukraine grant dual citizenship on demand, fearing
that a large Russian minority could gain political power.</tt><p>

<tt>Vietnam agreed during a February 23, 1995 meeting of  31 nations in Kuala
Lumpur to permit the repatriation of up to 3,600 Vietnamese boat people each
month.  The delegates also decided to maintain the December, 1995 deadline by
which all Vietnamese asylum seekers throughout Asia should be repatriated.  An
exception, until early 1996, was made for Hong Kong, which has more than half
of the 45,000 boat people in the Southeast Asia.  The plan must still be
approved at the Comprehensive Plan of Action Steering Committee meeting in
Geneva on March 16. </tt><p>
<tt>Voluntary repatriation is the goal for the 23,000 Vietnamese still in Hong
Kong, though over 1,000 boat people have been forced onto flights to Vietnam
since 1991, according the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. The US
has been reluctant to support forced repatriation.  Forced repatriation
agreements have been signed with all first asylum countries expect Thailand.
Vietnamese asylum seekers in the Philippines have threatened to commit suicide
rather than be sent back to Vietnam.</tt><p>
<tt>At the meeting, China announced that the Hong Kong will be not serve as the
port of first asylum after 1997.  No asylum seekers have ever been turned away
from Hong Kong.</tt><p>
<tt>There are 80,000 Vietnamese in Germany, about half of whom have essentially
an immigrant status in the former West Germany.  There were also about 11,000
Vietnamese in the former Eastern Germany.  Some 20,000 Vietnamese have applied
for asylum in Germany, but only about 200 have been granted refugee status.
</tt><p>
<tt>In January 1995, Germany and Vietnam reached an agreement under which
Germany will provide DM 100 million per year and Vietnam will agree to accept
its repatriated citizens.  The agreement does not rule out forcible
repatriation.</tt><p>
<tt>During a three-day visit to Vietnam on January 18, Cambodia's First Prime
Minister, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, promised Vietnam that there would be not
mass expulsions of ethnic Vietnamese in Cambodia.  Cambodia also agreed to
begin talks in February on what to do about Vietnamese residents in Cambodia.
</tt><p>
<tt>Vietnam estimates that 150,000 Vietnamese live in Cambodia--some have lived
there for generations. The Cambodian government says up to one million
Vietnamese live in the country, and many are illegal economic migrants. </tt><p>
<tt>Ethnic Vietnamese who left the Cambodian-Vietnamese border in 1993 cannot
return to Cambodia unless they have pre-1970 Cambodian papers.  Those with
post-1970 papers will be accepted on a case-by-case basis.  Those without any
legal identification papers will not be allowed to into Vietnam or Cambodia.
</tt><p>
<tt>The 3,705 ethnic Vietnamese who fled to Chrey Thom in 1993 are waiting
there to return to Cambodia.  The refugees traveled to the border under the
protection of the United Nations, after fleeing massacres of ethnic Vietnamese

Worker Rights in South Korea</a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>After a protest by Nepalese workers in Seoul last month, the South Korean
government announced reforms to protect the rights of foreign workers.  The
government will replace its foreign trainee program with a work permit system
that grants more rights to foreign workers.  The Nepalese workers claimed that
the trainee program was tantamount to slavery. </tt><p>
<tt>There are between 33,600 to 84,000 foreigners legally employed in  Korea,
and 19,000 to 32,000 of them are industrial trainees.</tt><p>
<tt>The new labor policy announced by the government promises easier entry for
foreign workers if small companies improve labor conditions. The government
next year will introduce a 'work permit' system, similar to ones used in
Singapore and Germany, to ensure a steady supply of imported labor.  Under the
work permit system, foreign workers will receive that same wages and legal
protections available to Korean workers. </tt><p>
<tt>There is some confusion in press reports about which program will be
terminated.  It is not clear if the work permit system will replace a recently
adopted training program for skilled workers, or only the unskilled "industrial
trainee" program that began in 1993.  </tt><p>
<tt>The Korean Federation of Small Businesses is offering 50,000 won (about
$63) for information on "runaway" foreign workers.  About 20 percent of the
industrial trainees admitted to Korea in the last half of 1994 left their
employers--who offer them less-than-minimum training wages--for higher wage
jobs elsewhere.</tt><p>
<tt>Beginning in March 1995, legal foreign workers will be eligible for workers
compensation coverage after paying a premium of $3.80 per month.  Under this
optional plan, employers will also pay $3.80 per month.</tt><p>

</a></h2>
<tt>Hong Kong officials worry that there will be a flood of Chinese immigrants
after the colony reverts to Chinese rule after 1997.  Although Hong Kong will
be a Special Administrative Region with its own immigration  laws, there is a
misconception among millions of Chinese that the gates will open for them.
</tt><p>
<tt>A delegation from Hong Kong was told in Beijing last December that a
massive publicity campaign would be launched six months before the change of
sovereignty to explain that the rules for traveling to Hong Kong will not
change.</tt><p>
<tt>Hong Kong legislators are asking the government to review its immigration
policy on Chinese mainland spouses and the children of Hong Kong residents.
Current law permits the entry of children of Hong Kong residents, but not
necessarily their mothers.  There is concern that this ambiguity in the law
could lead to a large influx of unaccompanied illegal child immigrants.</tt><p>
<tt>The daily quota for mainlanders is 105 one-way entry permits.  Fifteen of
these are for the wives of Hong Kong men and another 15 are for mainland-born
children of permanent residents.  The remaining 70 are allocated by local
Chinese officials.  </tt><p>
<tt>Hong Kong officials estimate that of the 300,000 mainland-born children of
Hong Kong residents in China, about 64,000 legitimate children will be eligible
for permanent residency.  About 55,000 mainland-born children with residency
rights are projected to be in China in 1997. The number of children under 15
who came to settle in Hong Kong on one-way permits in 1992, 1993 and 1994 was
7,853, 8,396 and 11,156, respectively. </tt><p>
<tt>In Hong Kong, up to 10 maids had their contracts terminated every day at
the end of 1994, as families went on holiday, and chose not to take along or
pay their maids, according to the chairman of the Asian Domestic Workers'
Union.  Maids whose contracts are terminated have two weeks to find another job
before they are required to leave Hong Kong.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC22">Chinese
Unemployment and
Migration</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>China has a labor force of about 600 million, with 440 million peasants,
109 million in the state sector, 36 million in the collective sector, and 15
million in the private sector.  The official unemployment rate is 2.8 percent,
but the real unemployment rate may be 15 to 17 percent, or the highest in
decades.</tt><p>
<tt>Workers are moving from rural to urban areas in response to higher wages,
but once there, they are competing with redundant urban workers for jobs.
Annual average incomes for farmers are $106, $262 for rural factory workers,
and $419 for urban factory workers.  Many urban workers are "xia gang" or off
post, meaning that they remain attached to their work unit, but they receive
only a portion of their wages and do not report to work.</tt><p>
<tt>Competition between "xia gang" and rural-urban migrants has led to tension,
especially in southeastern provinces such as Guangdong near Hong Kong, where
there are at least 13 million rural migrants looking for jobs.  Chinese and
Hong Kong officials are especially concerned with the increase of illegal
immigration from the northern provinces of China.  These immigrants are blamed
for an increase in crime. </tt><p>
<tt>Most cities and provinces try to protect local residents.  In Shanghai, an
official asserted that the four million migrants in that city should do its
"dirty work."  Only about 500,000 of Shanghai's migrant workers are officially
registered, which allows migrants to work legally in factories. </tt><p>
<tt>Some predict that social tensions and emigration pressures will rise
because of China's one-child policy.  Chinese parents prefer boys to girls, and
in 1990, there were 114 boy babies born for each 100 girl babies, far higher
than the usual 105 boys to 100 girl ratio.  This means that there are likely to
be one million more 20 year old boys than girls in 2010 and, since emigration
streams are often led by solo males, some predict rising emigration
pressures.</tt><p>
<tt>Despite China's one-child policy, the population is growing by 1.1 percent
per year, and reached 1.2 billion in February 1995.  In 1994, there were about
21 million births and seven million deaths.  Food production is stable or
declining, as China, with 22 percent of the world's population, tries to feed
itself with seven percent or 235 million acres of the world's arable land.

<a name="RTFToC23">Earthquake
forces Japan to deal with
Illegals</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a> 
</a></h2>
<tt>The January 17, 1995 Kobe earthquake that killed 5,300 people and left
300,000 homeless also prompted more than 350 illegal aliens to seek exit visas
to leave Japan at their own expense.  There are an estimated 293,000 illegal
aliens in Japan, and the government is simply repatriating, rather than
detaining or fining, those who lost their homes and jobs in the earthquake.
Illegal aliens are not entitled to housing or most other assistance that is
being made available to quake victims.</tt><p>
<tt>As Japan struggles to build replacement housing for those left homeless,
the government came under pressure to permit foreign carpenters to enter to
build the 2x4 wooden homes common in the western US, but rare in Japan.  These
homes withstood the quake far better than traditional Japanese homes, but Japan
is reluctant to permit US builders to bring to Japan the carpenters skilled in
2x4 construction.  Japan classifies carpenters as simple labor, and one
official asserted that, "Even in an emergency, we don't desire letting in
simple[foreign] laborers."</tt><p>
<tt>Some 2,365 illegal foreigners were deported from Japan following a major
crackdown in September, 1994.  More than 90 percent of those caught were
working illegally, usually in small and medium-sized enterprises, particularly
at construction sites and in metal goods manufacturing.  About one-fourth (509)
were Koreans, followed by 363 Thais and 292 Chinese.  In 1993 Japan repatriated
177,904 illegal  immigrants, up from 169,443 in the previous year.</tt><p>
<tt>The Kochi Prefectural Government announced that it would begin to accept
applications from and hire foreigners for certain city jobs, despite a 1953 law
that requires all public servants to be Japanese citizens.  About 1.3 million
foreigners were registered as residing in Japan in January 1994.</tt><p>
<tt>The Japanese deep-sea fishing labor management council has approved the use
of more foreign workers on fishing vessels because of a shortage of Japanese
workers.  The council will raise the current ceiling of 25 percent foreign
fisherman to 40 percent of the crew.  About 3,400 foreign fisherman worked on
the 1,700 Japanese deep-sea fishing boats in 1994.  About 70 percent of the
foreign fisherman were Indonesians, followed by Filipinos and Peruvians.  Wages
for foreign fisherman are about one-tenth of the wages of Japanese fishermen.

<a name="RTFToC24">Malaysia
Tackles Illegal Immigration
Again</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>Malaysia announced in February 1995 plans to impose sanctions of up to
RM50,000 ($20,000) on employers for each illegal alien hired under a proposed
Recruitment of Foreign Workers Act.  There are, by some estimates, one million
foreign workers in Malaysia--half are unauthorized, and many are reportedly the
victims of thugs who take advantage of their illegal status to rob them.  Some
reportedly pay $20 monthly, on earnings of $ 200 monthly, as protection money
to local gangs.</tt><p>
<tt>The Malaysian government on January 7, 1994 imposed a ban on the
importation of unskilled foreign workers.  There were several calls in
February, 1995, for Malaysia to review its foreign worker policies.  The
National Union of Plantation Workers warned that foreign workers will become a
permanent feature of the Malaysian labor market unless the government takes
action.  It recommends that a committee of union, employer, and government
officials review employer requests for foreign workers.</tt><p>
<tt>The Association of  Foreign Workers  Agencies argues that foreign workers
must be legal and better regulated.  They complain that, even with the
government's one-stop offices, there is a three to four month lag between an
employer's application and the arrival of the foreign workers.  There are 168
employment agencies that bring foreign workers into Malaysia, and 101 are
members of the Association.  Each agency must post a RM 100,000 or $40,000 bond
with the immigration department.</tt><p>
<tt>The Malaysian Prime Minister told members of the private sector, that
instead of importing new recruits from overseas, they should hire workers who
have already entered the country illegally.  The presence of foreign workers is
taxing the country's infrastructure, he said, especially in housing, health and
education, said the prime minister.  Malaysia is calling for the private sector
to develop industries which are not labor intensive. </tt><p>
<tt>Malaysia issued 200,000 three-year work permits in 1992, and there are
fears that the government will not renew some of them in 1995.  Developers in
Johor Bahru worry the their construction projects will come to a halt if the
foreign workers permits are not renewed.  About 90,000 of the passes were given
to foreign workers in Johor.  The passes are not automatically renewed and
workers are required to return to their native land to renew the passes or they
can be renewed by the employer in Kuala Lumpur.</tt><p>
<tt>Malaysia announced that illegal foreigners who marry aboriginal Orang Asli
will be deported if apprehended.  Some 241  foreigners, mostly men, reportedly
married Orang Asli women.</tt><p>

Expelled from
Gabon</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a</a></a></h2>
<tt>Gabon, a West African country of 1.1 million with a 1992 per capita income
of $4,450, in September 1994 enacted laws that required foreigners to pay
residence fees or leave the country by February 15, 1995.  Gabon, a once rich
oil producer in recession, has between 75,000 to 100,000 foreign workers,
primarily from Nigeria, Equatorial Guinea, Mali, Cameroon, France and Senegal.
Since the September, 1994 announcement of the February 15, 1995 deadline,
55,000 foreign nationals left the country, and 15,000 legalized their
residency.</tt><p>
<tt>There was criticism of the Gabonese government because of the fees on
migrants wishing to remain in the country.  The fees varied by country of
origin, with critics contending that migrants from the richest countries were
being charged the least.  French citizens, for example, were required to pay
only about $100 for a new residence card, while immigrants from many of West
Africa's poorest countries were charged as much as $1,200.</tt><p>
<tt>Criticism of the Gabon government increased as the February 15 deadline
approached.  Many immigrants could not afford the air fare and used trucks and
ships to return home. The Beninese government authorized hiring a ship to
evacuate Beninese living illegally in Gabon prior to the February 15 deadline.
</tt><p>
<tt>About 1,000 people, mostly Nigerians, Ghanians and nationals of neighboring
Equatorial Guinea, have been detained by a special unit to hunt illegal
immigrants since February 15. Those detained are being held in a camp and will
be repatriated.  Hundreds of people were reported to have fled into the
rainforest around the oil town of Port-Gentil to escape the police.   </tt><p>
<tt>The twin-island nations of Sao Tome and Principe have set up an emergency
commission and requested help from the United Nations to assist with the influx
of returnees. There are over 20,000 Sao Tomeans in Gabon forming Sao Tome's
second largest emigrant community.  About 25,000 Sao Tomeans live in Angola and
a further 10,000 live in Portugal.</tt><p>
<tt>The Gabonese government warned that any violence against foreigners would
be dealt with severely.  In 1992, violence followed the expulsion of thousands
of illegal Nigerian workers.  During an anti- immigrant campaign in late 1993,
many West Africans were rounded up and jailed in poorly maintained prisons.
About 60 of them, mostly Nigerians and Ghanaians, died in custody.</tt><p>
<tt>The Ivory Coast, also a magnet for foreign workers, enacted laws recently
that barred foreigners from voting.  The Ivory Coast recently passed laws that
bar foreigners from voting and require that presidential candidates be of pure
Ivorian parentage.</tt><p>

demands that Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza be permitted to work in
Israel. .  However, Israeli Prime Minister Rabin continues to called for up to
25,000 foreign workers to be brought into Israel to eliminate the need for
Palestinian commuters. </tt><p>
<tt>The number of Palestinian workers in Israel peaked 110,000 in 1987, and
there were about 60,000 before the ban.  The mid-February agreement permits up
to 15,000 Palestinians daily to enter Israel, far less than the  number
entering in January.  Israel has been replacing Palestinians shut out of Israel
with Romanian and Thai guest workers. </tt><p>
<tt>A week after the Beit Lid bombing in early February, the Israeli cabinet
authorized the importation of 6,000 foreign workers.  Most of the workers post
a bond and surrender their passport to their employer to ensure that they will
remain on the job during the contract.</tt><p>
<tt>In early February, several hundred Romanian and Thai workers demonstrated
near a construction site in Hod Hasaron.  The workers were demanding two
months'  back pay from a construction company that went bankrupt, stopping all
work on the site.  The workers complained that the construction company still
had their passports.</tt><p>
<tt>Thais are employed primarily in agriculture and construction and remit
about $700 million to Thailand each year.  Non-Palestinian guestworkers
allegedly accept lower pay and longer hours than other foreign workers.</tt><p>
<tt>The average per capita GDP in Israel was $12,300 in 1993, versus $1500 in
the West Bank and Gaza and $1200 in Jordan.  Israel has a population of 5.4

<tt>Black South Africans have recently begun to march to protest that illegal
immigrants are stealing jobs--they reportedly will work for $15 per week or
less--and for committing crimes and hawking goods in competition with
established businesses.  The major countries of origin are Mozambique, where
the government is barely functioning; Angola, ravaged by civil war; Malawi,
emerging from a decades-long dictatorship; and Zimbabwe, where a restructuring
of the economy has left many workers jobless.</tt><p>
<tt>The South African government would like promote economic development in the
countries of origin so that if does not have to deport aliens back to countries
that sheltered the ANC.  Migrant worker movements were halted in January 1995
in an effort to curb violence in South Africa.</tt><p>
<tt>Xenophobia is growing in South African townships that are housing migrants.
There are an estimated two to 8 million illegal aliens in South Africa, with
most experts agreeing that the two million figure is most realistic.  In
January, 1995, the Concerned Alexandra Residents' Association was created, and
it has led thousands of people on marches calling for illegal aliens to go
home.</tt><p>
<tt>The African nation of Malawi is carefully screening foreign workers to
ensure that they have work permits and do not replace native workers.  The
newly democratic government claims that the previous government gave work
permits to all foreign whites, even though qualified local workers were
available. Companies investing in Malawi often want to bring in foreign
managers. </tt><p>
<tt>The Malawi government also announced on February 14 that it has given
80,000 Mozambican refugees notice that they must return home by May or face a
cut-off in food and transportation.  More than one million Mozambicans have
already been repatriated.  The southern districts of Malawi is home to

<a name="RTFToC32">Benefits
and Costs of Immigrants</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a> 
</a></h2>
<tt>The Rand Corporation held a one-day workshop on January 26, 1995 to review
studies of the taxes paid and the costs of benefits provided to
immigrants--legal and illegal.  Two background points were emphasized.  First,
all studies are forced to use snapshots to try to construct a motion picture
account of immigrants' lives.  Second, there are a number of legitimate
conceptual issues that are obscured rather than highlighted in many
studies.</tt><p>
<tt>For example, a snapshot study of the taxes paid by, and the tax-paid
services received by, high school or college students would show that most cost
more than they pay.  Yet such findings cause little concern, because we assume
that those who complete school will eventually earn more and pay higher taxes.
</tt><p>
<tt>There are dozens of conceptual issues.  These include what costs to use.
For example, should one include only costs attributable to illegal aliens, or
also costs attributable to their US citizen children who would not be here if
their parents were not?  Should the costs attributed to immigrants, legal or
illegal, be the generally minimal marginal costs of providing park or
transportation services to one more person, or the typically higher average
cost calculated by taking the total cost of education or health care and
dividing by the number of residents?</tt><p>
<tt>Most studies of the taxes paid by and the costs of providing services to
illegal aliens use as a benchmark a 1992 Los Angeles county study.  Los Angeles
county has about nine million residents, including an estimated one million
unauthorized aliens, or one-fourth of the unauthorized aliens in the US.
Immigrants at the extremes of the education distribution--with college degrees
and without high-school diplomas--continued to move into Los Angeles despite a
severe recession that encouraged high-school educated US citizens to leave.
</tt><p>
<tt>Los Angeles began to lose jobs in 1989.  Nonfarm wage and salary employment
in Los Angeles county fell by 500,000, from  a peak 4.2 million in October 1989
to a 3.7 million in October 1994.  All studies agree that the taxes paid by
generally youngish and lower-than-average-earning immigrants go primarily to
the federal government, while the costs of public services used by immigrants
and their families are provided mainly by state and local governments.
Furthermore, most studies conclude that illegal immigrants do not generate as
much in revenues to cover the costs of the public services they consume.
</tt><p>
<tt>The result was a budget squeeze, and a reaction against especially illegal
immigration as exemplified by Prop 187 in November 1994.</tt><p>
<tt>Rand reviewed the taxes paid and costs of services provided and concluded
that the national studies were not comparable because all included different
amounts of costs and revenues.  According to Rand estimates, the amount of
revenues included ranged from 45 to 75 percent of actual revenues collected
directly and indirectly from immigrants, and the percentage of costs included
ranged from 40 to 80 percent.  Thus, one reason why there is disagreement on
whether all immigrants, or subgroups of immigrants, "pay their way" is that
different studies include different percentages of the universe of possible
costs and revenues.</tt><p>
<tt>All studies agree that US-born citizens have more favorable revenue-cost
ratios than recent immigrants, and that legal immigrants have more favorable
revenue-cost ratios than illegal immigrants.  These differences are due
primarily to assumptions about earnings and taxes paid.  </tt><p>
<tt>According to Rand, lack of adequate data on actual service usage and tax
payments by immigrants have led the studies to make potentially erroneous
assumptions.  For instance, many of the studies assume that illegal immigrants
have a high incidence of payroll deductions and tax payments.  But RAND found
that less than 40 percent of a sample of illegal Salvadorans in Los Angeles had
payroll taxes deducted from their average $10,000 incomes in the early
1990s.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC33">Characteristics
of US Farm Workers</a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>Gabbard, Susan, Richard Mines, and Beatiz Boccalandro.  1994.  Migrant
Farmworkers:  Pursuing Security in an Unstable Labor Market.  Washington DC:
US Department of Labor , ASP Research Report 5, May.</tt><p>
<tt>This report is based on interviews with workers employed on US crop farms
in the early 1990s.  Migrant farmworkers are defined as those who moved at
least 75 miles from their usual residences to do farmwork, and 42 percent of
the sample workers were migrants under this definition.  </tt><p>
<tt>There is no firm estimate of the number of US farmworkers, and there is no
uniform definition of migrant farm worker.  <b>If</b> there are 2.5 million US
farmworkers, and <b>if</b> the sample covered 1.6 million workers employed on
crop farms, then there would be 670,000 migrant farmworkers on crop farms.
Note that if 10 percent of the remaining 900,000 workers were migrants, the
overall migrant percentage would be 30 percent of the US hired farm workforce
(90 + 670/2500=30).</tt><p>
<tt>Most migrant farmworkers are immigrants--85 percent--and another 10 percent
are US-born Hispanics.  Their mean age was 30, they had an average seven years
US farm work experience, they had an average 6.5 years of schooling, and they
averaged fewer than three US farm employers per year.  Migrants averaged 25
weeks of farm work annually, and earned about $5.60 hourly.</tt><p>
<tt>Two major types of migrants are distinguishable in the data:  follow the
crop migrants who move from one US farm to another, and shuttle migrants who
move back and forth between Mexican homes and US farm jobs.  A few migrants
shuttle into the US and then follow the crops.  About one in three migrant
workers follows the crops, five in six shuttle back and forth, and one in six
do both.</tt><p>
<tt>Follow the crop migrants were the predominant type of migrants in the
1960s, and the notion that migrant workers follow the sun from south to north
is the image that still comes to mind when migrants are discussed today.
However, only 13 percent of crop workers--an estimated 210,000--and less than
10 percent of all farmworkers--had at least two US farm jobs at least 75 miles
apart within in one year.  </tt><p>
<tt>There has been a major change in the "base state" or usual residence of
migrant farmworkers--Mexico has replaced Florida, Texas, and California.  Most
migrant farmworkers shuttle back and forth between homes in Mexico and jobs in
the US, i.e., they maintain homes at least 75 miles from the place where they
do farm work for wages.  Most of these shuttle migrants--83 percent--have homes
in Mexico, and commute to US farm jobs.  One in six migrants live in one US
location, such as South Texas, and commute to another US location to do farm
work, such as California or Michigan.  </tt><p>
<tt>Migrants prefer to settle in one location.  By arraying workers by their
years of US farm work experience, it appears that men with less than six years
of US farm work experience shuttle or back and forth without their families,
and sometimes follow the crops within the US, but later they shuttle into the
US for farm jobs in one area, and then settle in the US.  </tt><p>
<tt>Since migration, especially follow the crop migration, is associated with
younger immigrant workers who travel without their families, these data call
into question some of the premises upon which the $600 million in federal farm
worker assistance programs are based.  These programs assume that there are
significant numbers of migrant farm worker families who follow the crops, and
that their children will be unable to escape the migrant stream without
assistance.  The NAWS  data, however, indicate that, when migrant workers gain
experience, they "naturally" tend to settle in one area.

<a name="RTFToC34">DBSB
RFPs Invited</a>
</a></h2>
<tt>The Demographic and Behavioral Sciences Branch (DBSB), Center for
Population Research, National Institute of Child Health and Human Development
(NICHD) invites qualified researchers to submit applications for research on
immigration to the United States.  For the purposes of this PA, an immigrant
refers to a foreign-born person who enters the United States without U.S.
citizenship.  The large number of immigrants in the past two decades may have
already had a major impact on the social and economic structure of the United
States.  </tt><p>
<tt>American immigration policies have been shaped by a duality of economic and
humanitarian concerns.  Humanitarian concerns are reflected in the preferential
treatment of refugees as well as the importance of </tt><p>
<tt>family reunification as a selection criterion for immigrant status.
Especially in recent times, public policy and scientific debates about
immigration have focused on the estimation methods used to count the numbers of
immigrants and emigrants, and the effectiveness of public policies in dealing
with the impact of immigrants, particularly their contributions and costs to
society.</tt><p>
<tt>The purpose of this Program Announcement is to encourage: 1) development of
methodological research tools for measurement and analysis of immigration and
emigration; 2) descriptive and analytical study of immigrant populations,
particularly immigrant children and families; 3) maximum use of existing data
on immigrants or the foreign born for analyses, and the linking of such data to
administrative records on, for example, program and welfare use to obtain a
more accurate profile of immigrant experiences; and 4) the collection of new
longitudinal and panel data to examine issues such as the health, socioeconomic
status, and resilience of immigrants, as well as intergenerational transmission
of skills and resources.</tt><p>
<tt>For further information contact:  Inquiries are encouraged.  The
opportunity to clarify any issues or questions from potential applicants is
welcome.  Direct inquiries regarding programmatic issues to:</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC2">Illegal
Immigration and the Peso
Devaluation</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>Experts predicted in 1994 that Operation Gatekeeper would reduce illegal
immigration from Mexico.  But then came the 50 percent devaluation of the
Mexican peso, and the number of aliens apprehended jumped in January and
February 1995 over 30 percent above year earlier levels, with especially sharp
increases in apprehensions in Arizona.</tt><p>
<tt>The spring and summer of 1995 will provide a test of how well beefed-up US
border controls can cope with sharp increases in Mexican emigration pressures.
The peso has lost about 50 percent of its value since December 20, 1994,
widening the US-Mexican wage gap from 8 to 1 to about 12 to 1 (wages in Mexico
have been raised).  In addition, up to 10 percent of the 10 million Mexicans
who have formal sector jobs may lose them.</tt><p>
<tt>There have been several attempts to project Mexico to US migration in 1995.
Princeton demographer Tom Espenshade, who puts the annual flow of unauthorized
Mexicans in the US sometime during a typical year at 1.5 to 3 million,
predicted for the US Treasury, an annual increase of 460,000 illegal border
crossers including about 40,000 who would settle in the United States.  </tt><p>
<tt>Most US migration researchers agree with Espenshade that unauthorized
Mexico-to-US migration is likely to rise in 1995.  Both UCSD's Wayne Cornelius
and University of Pennsylvania's Doug Massey, for example, report that in the
Mexican villages from which most migrants come "bags are packed" for the trek
north--stepped up border controls, they argue, are not likely to deter
migrants. </tt><p>
<tt>In a January 1995 survey, Cornelius found that 30 percent of the Mexicans
questioned thought that "it was not at all difficult" to find a job as an
illegal alien in the US, while 28 percent thought that it was "very difficult."
Over 80 percent of the Mexicans interviewed by Cornelius had heard of Operation
Gatekeeper, and 80 percent thought that it was now more difficult to enter the
US, but over 70 percent of those who had worked in the US in recent years were
thinking of migrating to the US in 1995.</tt><p>
<tt>INS Commissioner Doris Meissner on February 24, 1995 said that some of the
undocumented immigrants being apprehended by INS agents have said they crossed
the border because of plant closings or other job losses related to the peso
devaluation.</tt><p>
<tt>Some Mexican researchers, on the other hand, argue that suddenly poorer
Mexicans may not be able to finance the trip to the US.  Jorge Bustamante,
President of the Colegio de la Frontera Norte (COLEF), a Mexican research
center in Ensenada, said the number might actually drop because the cost of
traveling to the United States has increased by about 50 percent.  In one
report, the average cost of being smuggled from Tijuana to Los Angeles rose
from about $300 to $450.  </tt><p>
<tt>COLEF researchers monitoring illegal border crossings from Mexico report
that, as a result of Operation Gatekeeper, aliens must often make four or five
rather than just one or two entry attempts.  However, there is no indication
that the need to make multiple entry attempts has so far deterred large numbers
of illegal entrants.</tt><p>
<tt>Cornelius emphasizes that so many migrants have left rural Mexico and
settled in the US since 1986 that there is not much "migration potential" left
in many traditional emigration areas.  Moreover, settlement in the US has also
reduced remittances to communities of origin, increasing the migration
potential of those who remain.</tt><p>
<tt>There have been three major peso devaluations in the past 15 years, and
each has produced a distinct migration response.  In 1982-83, Mexico also
experienced a sharp peso devaluation (70 percent), but much of the adjustment
took the form of lower real wages in urban areas rather than open unemployment.
In rural areas, it took 16 months of a cost-price squeeze on farmers to produce
a significant increase in apprehensions. </tt><p>
<tt>In 1986-87, the US offered amnesty or legal status to practically any rural
Mexican who had some US farm work experience.  Because of US legalization, the
mid-1980s peso devaluation was not associated with increased apprehensions in
1987.</tt><p>
<tt>In 1994-95, by contrast, Nora Lustig of the Brookings Institution notes
that the adjustment seems to be taking the from of open unemployment in urban
areas, as manufacturing and other firms announce bankruptcies and layoffs.
Separations from good jobs seem to be concentrated in urban areas, while
emergency programs to alleviate the effects of devaluation seem to be
concentrated in rural areas.  The Mexican government plans to temporarily
employ 500,000 unemployed workers to build rural roads.  </tt><p>
<tt>If more urban-origin migrants head north in 1995, then a new set of
migration streams may be set in motion, promising more migration in the years
ahead.</tt><p>
<tt>As the number of apprehensions along the US-Mexican border rose 38 percent
to 118,000 in February 1995 in comparison to February 1994, US Border Patrol
agents report that violence against them has increased.  Seven of the nine
US-Mexican Border Patrol sectors--San Diego and El Centro, California; Yuma and
Tucson, Arizona; and El Paso, Del Rio, Marfa, Laredo, and McAllen, Texas--saw
apprehensions rise  (the Border Patrol divides US borders into 21 sectors).
These stations had 3,750 agents--or 88 percent of all agents-- in September
1994.  </tt><p>
<tt>Agents reportedly have more rocks thrown at them, encounter nails driven
through boards to stop their vehicles, and often confront larger groups of
aliens being smuggled into the US.  Mexico has promised to expand its Grupo
Beta, which seeks to eliminate border crimes committed against aliens, but not
deter Mexicans from migrating illegally to the US, and to crack down harder on
smugglers of aliens (coyotes).</tt><p>
<tt>The US and the Mexican governments have launched a three-part study of the
magnitude, impacts, and solutions for unauthorized Mexico-to-US migration.  The
study was launched in February 1995, with Mexico and the US sharing its costs.
The aim is to reach consensus at each phase of the study--numbers,
characteristics, push-pull factors, impacts, and policy recommendations--before
proceeding to the next phase.</tt><p>

Unity</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>The number of immigrants electing to become naturalized US citizens jumped
75 percent in the first four months of 1995.  In FY94, some 558,139
applications were filed.  In the first quarter of FY95 (October-December 1994),
some 234,000 applications for naturalization were filed, almost a
million-a-year pace.  The Los Angeles INS district has been receiving 1,500 or
more naturalization applications every day in 1995, double the number in
1994--about half of California's naturalization applicants are believed to be
in the Los Angeles area.</tt><p>
<tt>According to the INS, an average 235,000 naturalization petitions were
filed in the late 1980s, and a similar number of aliens became naturalized US
citizens.  Petitions and naturalizations rose in the early 1990s:  there were
342,00 petitions filed in 1992, and 240,000 persons naturalized, and 522,000
petitions filed in FY93, when 315,000 persons naturalized.</tt><p>
<tt>There are several reasons for the upsurge in naturalizations.  First, the
number of aliens eligible for naturalization is peaking, as those legalized in
1987-88 become eligible.  Second, Congress is debating measures to make non-US
citizens ineligible for many welfare benefits--many commentators asserted that
the upsurge in naturalization applications represented a backlash against
Congressional Republican attempts to deny benefits to non-citizens.  According
to the Department of Health and Human Services, some 2.2 million legal
immigrants would lose benefits if the Republican plan is approved.  Some assert
that a high percentage of persons naturalized tend to vote in the first
election after they receive voting rights, which would be 1996 for persons
naturalized in 1995.</tt><p>
<tt>Third, the INS is requiring the estimated one million aliens who arrived
before 1979 to replace by March 20, 1995 their I-551 Alien Identification or
green cards--between 1946 and 1964, the card was green.  The new I-551, which
costs $75, has a photo, fingerprint and signature--a naturalization application
costs $95, only $20 more.</tt><p>
<tt>There are more than 10 million immigrants in the US eligible to become US
citizens, and the INS has proposed a simplification of the rules under which
aliens can become naturalized US citizens.</tt><p>
<tt>Under current procedures, an alien 18 or older must be a permanent US
resident for at least five years, with no absences of more than a year, and
pass an English and civics test.  Aliens married to US citizens can become
naturalized US citizens after three years.  </tt><p>
<tt>Aliens wishing to become naturalized US citizens must complete a four-page
application form (N-400), be fingerprinted, and pay a fee of $95; they must
also be persons "of good moral character, attached to the principles of the
Constitution of the United States, and well disposed to the good order and
happiness of the United States."  </tt><p>
<tt>They are then scheduled to be interviewed and tested by an INS official for
their knowledge of English and US government--applicants are asked five to ten
of 100 questions on US history and government.  Aliens 50 and older with 20
years US residence, or 55 and older with 15 years residence, are offered a
simplified English test.</tt><p>
<tt>Most naturalization applicants take about 50 hours of instruction in
English and civics in classes organized by schools, churches, unions, and
Community-Based Organizations (CBOs).  CBOs and community colleges are already
permitted to certify an alien's knowledge of English.  </tt><p>
<tt>The INS is considering a proposal to let CBOs certify an applicant's
knowledge of civics to reduce backlogs that have lengthened the wait between
petitioning for naturalization and the interview-test to six months or more.
Some CBOs believe the US government should subsidize their teaching and testing
of immigrants.</tt><p>
<tt>Most Mexican and Canadian immigrants who are eligible to become naturalized
US citizens do not do so for fear of losing legal and emotional links to
Mexico.  Mexican citizens lose their Mexican citizenship when they become US
citizens, and many Mexican immigrants falsely fear that loss of Mexican
citizenship might threaten their property rights in Mexico.  Mexico recently
changed its citizenship laws to permit Mexican citizens to reclaim Mexican
citizenship if they wish.  Some are pushing for both the US and Mexico to adopt
dual citizenship.</tt><p>
<tt>In a settlement of a class-action suit on March 31, 1995, the INS and
immigration rights lawyers established new family unity guidelines in
immigration law.  Under the new standards, immigrants living continuously in
the US since May 5, 1988 may return to their home countries for visits without
fear that their naturalization applications will be denied.  </tt><p>
<tt>The settlement also affects undocumented family members of persons
legalized during the 1980s amnesty programs.  Under the family unity provision,
qualified undocumented immigrants who arrived two years before the cut-off date
of May 5, 1988, can receive renewable work authorization and protection from
deportation while their naturalization cases are considered. </tt><p>
<tt>In a related development, a federal judge in California dismissed an INS
effort to close the door on an estimated 300,000 illegal aliens who assert that
they failed to apply for legalization in 1987-88 because of an INS rule that,
to be eligible, illegal aliens had to live in the US CONTINUOUSLY since January
1, 1982.  The INS rule was later modified to permit "brief, casual, and
innocent" absences from the US but, on January 30, 1995, the INS announced that
it would no longer accept applications from illegal aliens who claim that they
were discouraged from applying for legalization.</tt><p>
<tt>The lawsuit, now in its ninth year, seeks to force the INS to permit
eligible "discouraged aliens" from applying for legalization.  Hundreds of
applications continue to be filed each month in Los Angeles and New
York.</tt><p>

<tt>Congress continued to hold hearings throughout March on proposals to reduce
illegal immigration and reform the system for admitting legal immigrants. The
Commission on Immigration Reform (CIR) considered many of the same
issues</a></a></a></a></a></a>.  The CIR is expected to issue recommendations
on legal immigration during the summer of 1995.</tt><p>
<tt>On March 7, 1995, Sen. Alan Simpson (R-Wyoming) and Rep. Lamar Smith
(R-Texas) held a joint press conference to announce plans to introduce
legislation that deals with legal and illegal immigration.  Simpson, chairman
of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration and Refugee Affairs,
introduced a bill targeting illegal immigration, and a hearing was held on S
269 on March 14, 1995.</tt><p>
<tt>Smith, chairman of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration and
Claims, has been holding weekly hearings on immigration issues.  Smith
announced that he would not support a House Republican plan to make legal
immigrants ineligible for welfare benefits, but that he would support measures
that would make sponsors of immigrants legally liable for supporting them until
the alien becomes a US citizen.</tt><p>
<tt>Sen. Diane Feinstein (D-CA) introduced a reform package on March 21 which
includes a $1.00 border crossing fee, increases in civil and criminal penalties
for forgers and makes document fraud an aggravated felony.  The measure would
also increase employer sanctions with fines ranging from $1,000 to $3,000 per
undocumented worker hired.  Current fines range from $250 to $2,000.
Feinstein's reform package also includes an employer verification system and
adding 2,100 Border Patrol agents. </tt><p>
<tt>Unlike the Simpson measure, the legislation does not call for reducing
legal immigration.  Feinstein has not endorsed Simpson's plan, although the two
measures are similar.  </tt><p>
<tt>The 41-member House Task Force on Immigration headed by Rep. Elton Gallegly
(R-CA) is due to make recommendations to reduce illegal immigration by June
1995, so that the House can hold hearings and approve immigration reform
legislation by September.  Gallegly asserted that his proposals would make it
tougher for illegal aliens to enter and work in the US, but he left open the
door to an expanded guest worker program to fill "legitimate" labor
needs.</tt><p>
<tt>The House Government Reform and Oversight Subcommittee on Government
Management, Information and Technology on March 7, 1995 heard about the INS
Telephone Verification System (TVS) Pilot system under which 200 employers in
industries likely to employ illegal aliens can call in newly hired workers'
A-numbers to verify their right to work.  Under TVS, an employer gains instant
access to the INS database, and can determine whether a newly-hired worker is
authorized to work in the US.  The employer punches in a code, the employee's
date of birth, and his or her A-number, and minutes later receives a report
from the INS on whether the A-number is valid, and whether it permits
employment.</tt><p>
<tt>In 70 percent of the cases, INS confirmed employment authorization right
away, and secondary verification took five to ten days.  The theory is that
fraudulent documents will lose their value, because the employer will in most
cases learn instantly that the worker is not authorized to work in the US.  The
INS system currently works only for aliens, and relies only on INS data.</tt><p>
<tt>If the worker is not authorized to work, the employer keeps the employee,
mails in a secondary verification form, and awaits the results of manual
verification.  This INS computer verification system is being extended from 9
businesses nationwide to 200 Los Angeles area employers in 1995-96, and to
1,000 in 1996-97.</tt><p>
<tt>On February 23, 1995 CIR Chair Barbara Jordan repeated before the House
Judiciary Committee's Immigration and Claims Subcommittee the CIR's
recommendation that pilot computer employee validation systems that combine
data from Social Security Administration and Immigration and Naturalization
Service be tested to enable US employers to determine quickly if ALL
newly-hired workers are authorized to be employed in the United States.
According to a Harris poll, 53 percent of Americans in 1994 favor a national
work permit system for US citizens and authorized aliens, up from 46 percent in
1990.<b></b></tt><p>
<tt><b></b>On February 22, 1995, the INS announced that it had detected over
5,000 aliens working in entry-level hotel, restaurant, construction, and
manufacturing jobs in Arizona after a 10-month investigation.  About 10 percent
of the 50,000 I-9 forms at 500 Arizona companies that were checked by the INS
were signed by workers not authorized to hold US jobs.  About 500 unauthorized
workers were deported, and 30 employers were fined $326,120.  According to the
INS, most employers were not purposely violating the employer sanctions
law.</tt><p>
<tt>The CIR also called for better border management--deterring illegal
crossings while facilitating legal ones.  Jordan also emphasized that,
"Deportation is crucial.  Credibility in immigration policy can be summed up in
one sentence: those who should get in, get in; those who should be kept out,
are kept out; and those who should not be here will be required to
leave."</tt><p>
<tt>About 333 million foreigners were admitted at 200 air, land, and sea ports
with legal visas in FY94, and 662,000 were denied entry to the US--90 percent
of the legal entries were over US land borders.  About 93 percent of all
nonimmigrants enter with visitor visas for pleasure or business. </tt><p>
<tt>Procedures for issuing visas vary from country to country, with
face-to-face interviews required in countries where fraud is common.  Visitors
from 22 countries coming to the United States for business or pleasure for up
to 90 days may be admitted without visas under the Visa Waiver Pilot Program.
Mexicans can receive border crossing cards, which permit them to travel within
25 miles of the border for up to 72 hours.</tt><p>
<tt>Of the estimated 300,000 visa overstayers in 1992, 60,000 were Mexicans,
18,000 Italians, 15,000 Filipinos, 13,000 Bahamians, and 9,000 Poles.
Lawfully-admitted nonimmigrants comprise approximately 33 percent of aliens
filing asylum applications with INS.  </tt><p>
<tt>According to the British press, there are an estimated 150,000 illegal
alien workers from Britain in the US, and more are being apprehended in INS
raids on British-themed restaurants.  Most presented their US employers with
false documents.</tt><p>
<tt>On March 14, House Republican leaders decided to bar legal immigrants only
from five of the 60-some federal assistance programs that would have become
off-limits to them under the original welfare reform proposal.  Legal
immigrants would be barred from the so-called Big 5 programs--Medicaid ($155
billion in federal-state costs per year), Food Stamps ($27 billion), Disability
aid, AFDC ($23 billion), and Title 20 social service programs--they would not
be barred from employment and training programs.  States would also gain more
power to require the sponsors of immigrants to repay the cost of any aid that
the immigrants receive.</tt><p>
<tt>Most of the savings anticipated from welfare reform come from barring
non-citizens from welfare programs.  For example, if the proposed ban on non-US
citizens receiving AFDC is approved, the CBO estimates that about $2 billion
annually would be saved from the $23 billion federal-state AFDC program.
During the summer of 1993, about four million mothers were receiving AFDC
payments for 10 million children.  There were about 4.2 million foreign-born
mothers, and nine percent or 400,000 of them were receiving AFDC payments,
about the same as the 11 percent rate for US-born mothers.</tt><p>

and California Population
Growth</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></></a></a></a></a></h2>
<tt>The US population was estimated to be 260 million on July 1, 1994, up from
249 million in 1990.  There are about four million births annually, and two
million deaths, so that natural increase adds about two million Americans per
year.</tt><p>
<tt>Net international migration adds another 770,000 residents per year,
according to Census estimates.  About 43 percent of the immigrants are
Hispanic, 30 percent are Asian, and 10 percent are Black.</tt><p>
<tt>The largest five states included 36 percent of all residents.  California,
with 31 million people (12 percent), Texas and, New York, 18 million each
(seven percent each), Florida, 14 million (five percent), and Pennsylvania, 12
million (almost five percent). </tt><p>
<tt>According to the UCLA Business Forecasting Project, California's employment
grew by almost two percent in 1994 to 12.2 million nonfarm employees, up from
the 1993 low of 12 million.  California's population, which had been growing by
almost three percent per year in 1989-90, is now growing by only one percent
per year--in 1994, net immigration to California is projected to be zero, the
first time in recent memory that as many people left the state as
entered.</tt><p>
<tt>Even though California's economy is turning up, 57 percent of Californians
in a March 1995 poll believed that the state was on the "wrong track."  A
majority of those polled thought that California's economy would get better in
two or three years, but one-third are not confident that they will have their
current jobs in six months.</tt><p>
<tt>Data on job attachment between 1973 and 1993 indicate that a stable 20
percent of American workers aged 45 to 54 have worked for the same company for
more than 20 years, and half of them have worked for the same employer for 10
or more years.  This apparent stability of job attachment seems to fly in the
face of stories of corporate cutbacks at companies such as IBM and Kodak that
used to offer "lifetime employment."  It may be that job attachment is
declining fastest among the less-educated men whose real earnings are also
declining, fueling the "angry white men" syndrome to which some attribute
Republican political victories.</tt><p>
<tt>Moving company records for 1994 indicate that almost twice as many families
were moved out of California as were moved in, 95,500 out, and 54,300 in.
However, California continues to receive enough immigrants so that, even if
twice as many residents leave California for Texas, Washington, Arizona, and
Colorado, the state's population grows as immigrants replace departing
Californians, and immigrants and resident Californians have babies.</tt><p>

<tt>As Congress debates what to do to reduce illegal immigration, there were
several reviews of the level of illegal immigration, and the efforts of INS to
reduce it.</tt><p>
<tt>Demographer Jeff Passel notes that ESTIMATES of number of illegal aliens in
the US have fallen while the actual NUMBER increased.  For example, estimates
of six to 12 million illegal aliens were common in the late 1970s, even though
it was later estimated that about 2.1 illegal aliens were included in the 1980
Census.</tt><p>
<tt>In 1985, Passel estimated that there were three to five million illegal
aliens.  Some two million were legalized in 1987-88, or about two-thirds of the
illegal aliens in the US since 1982, and the number of illegal aliens was
estimated at 2.2 million in 1988.  However, the number then began to increase,
reaching an estimated 3.4 million in October 1992, and 4 million at the end of
1994.</tt><p>
<tt>Between October 1986 and 1988, there was an especially sharp drop in the
number and share of Mexican illegal aliens because so many Mexicans were
legalized.  Mexicans dropped from about 58 percent to 38 percent of the total
population of illegal aliens in the US, and in California the estimated illegal
alien population fell from 2.9 million to 800,000.    </tt><p>
<tt>There are two broad strategies to combat illegal immigration.  What might
be called the "island" model is the policy of the UK and Australia, which have
strict entry controls, but neither residence permits nor employer sanctions.
The so-called "continental" strategy puts the primary emphasis on internal
controls, usually with residence and employment permits.  </tt><p>
<tt>The US has traditionally relied on a continental strategy, relying
primarily on the Border Patrol to deter illegal entry, but an analysis by INS
statistician Bob Warren of data on aliens who entered the US legally, and then
stayed too long and became illegal aliens, suggests that most of the 3.4
million illegal aliens who were believed to be living in the US in October 1992
entered the US legally.  These data suggest that the US may be pushed to move
toward both island and continental strategies, beefing up both border controls
and internal controls.  The number of illegal aliens was increasing by about
300,000 per year between 1988 and 1992.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS in August 1994 adopted a strategic plan that shifts the focus from
apprehending aliens to preventing the entry of illegal aliens.  Some in
Congress are pressing the INS to adopt the El Paso Hold-the-Line strategy of
flooding the border with agents to deter illegal entries in California.
According to some estimates, 8,000 to 9,000 agents concentrated on the 165
miles of border through which most illegals enter could dramatically reduce
illegal immigration.  The INS counters that Hold the Line is not appropriate in
San Diego, where an estimated 99 percent of the illegal alien entrants are
passing en route to an interior location such as Los Angeles, versus 35 percent
in El Paso.</tt><p>
<tt>According to the INS, the San Diego strategy of using three lines of agents
to apprehend all illegal entrants IS working.  Aliens apprehended report that
the price of being smuggled to Los Angeles has jumped 50 percent, from $300 to
$450, and the GAO agreed with the INS in testimony on March 10 that smugglers
are attempting to bring aliens into the US in other areas, especially
Arizona.</tt><p>
<tt>In FY 93, the San Diego and El Paso Border Patrol sectors accounted for
two-thirds of the 1.2 million southwest border apprehensions.  In FY92, over
half of all southwest border apprehensions occurred along only 18 of the 1,600
border miles--13 miles along the border between San Diego and Tijuana, Mexico,
and five miles along the border between El Paso and Ciudad Juarez, Mexico.  In
response to the INS's new border control strategies, in FY94, the San Diego and
El Paso's share of total southwest border apprehensions dropped from two-thirds
in fiscal year 1993 to about one-half in fiscal year 1994.</tt><p>
<tt>The Border Patrol reopened in March the checkpoint on Interstate 5, 66
miles north of the US-Mexican border, to determine how many illegal aliens were
getting into the US despite Operation Gatekeeper.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC7">CIR
Considers Immigration's Impacts on US Labor
Markets</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a><a></a></a></a></a></h2>
<tt>At a CIR hearing February 23, a Department of Labor representative urged
the CIR to reduce employment-based immigration in order to balance employers'
needs for international labor market access with the need to invest in
education and job training for US workers.  Several CIR commissioners argued
that more rather than fewer immigrants should be selected on the basis of US
employer needs, but DOL argued that, if the US continues to admit large numbers
of foreign scientists and engineers, 20 years from now even more will be needed
because the US will have given up on ways to interest young people in these
careers.  </tt><p>
<tt>Also on February 23, the CIR heard George Borjas, a professor at the
University of California, San Diego, argue that 20 percent of the wage gap
between less-skilled and more skilled workers in the United States is due to
the presence of the most recent wave of immigrants, legal and illegal, who have
fewer skills than previous generations of immigrants.  Vernon Briggs of Cornell
University argued that the labor market is being buffeted by changes such as
defense cutbacks, echo baby boomers entering the labor market, and more women
working for wages, and that, immigration today is "far too high for labor
market needs."</tt><p>
<tt>Harriet Orcutt Duleep of the Urban Institute argued that only illegal
immigrants and refugees have low levels of education, although her analysis
excluded all Mexican immigrants because it was hard to separate legal and
illegal Mexican immigrants in the data used.  Markley Roberts of the AFL-CIO
argued that DOL should do an even better job of labor
certification--determining that American workers were truly not available
before allowing US employers to hire foreign workers.  DOL finds that employers
are often employing the same foreign workers illegally that they are requesting
DOL to certify that they need.</tt><p>
<tt>Representatives of US engineers and computer programmers argued that the US
is permitting the entry of foreigners to fill jobs even though there are large
numbers of unemployed American engineers and programmers.  US employers, they
argued, use temporary foreign workers because they are cheaper and easier to
recruit.  It was noted that entry-level engineering salaries have fallen three
percent between 1974 and 1994, from $35,700 to $34,700 in 1994 dollars.  The
real wages of more experienced engineers fell even more.  An engineer with a
Master's degree and 25 years experience made $78,600 in 1974 (in 1994 dollars),
and $71, 400 in 1994.</tt><p>
<tt>In a critical review of DOL labor certification procedures, a Boston firm
attempting to hire a British alien who did not have a BA degree, and thus did
qualify for a professional employment visa, reportedly spent $10,000 and six
months before securing a temporary visa for the British worker.  As the story
makes clear, US employers think that the tough part is finding the ideal
foreign candidate for a vacant job; US labor certification procedures, they
feel, are simply a bureaucratic obstacle to getting the foreign worker they
feel is needed.</tt><p>
<tt>A US employer who wants to bring into the US temporary foreign workers must
file two applications for alien labor certification with the Department of
Labor.  The first, labeled an ETA-750A, specifies the terms and salary of the
particular job; the second, called an ETA-750B and filled out by the would-be
recruit, lists the applicant's qualifications.  The local Employment Service
(ES) office where the employer files the application then does a prevailing
wage survey to ensure that the employer is offering the going wage.  </tt><p>
<tt>After the ES approves the wage offer, the employer is required to do three
kinds of recruiting: The employer has to place an ad for the job with the
employment department for 30 days, within its own offices for 10 days, and in
an "appropriate publication" for no less than three consecutive days.  When US
citizens and legal immigrants respond to the ads, the employer is required to
provide the employment department with "lawful, job-related reasons" for not
choosing them.</tt><p>
<tt>Janitors are the largest single occupation in the US in which a majority of
the workers are probably immigrants, and the 10-year Justice for Janitors
campaign of the Service Employees International Union is moving from cities
such as Los Angeles, New York, San Jose, and San Francisco, where a majority of
the janitors are SEIO members, to smaller cities such as Sacramento.  Non-union
janitors typically earn about $5 per hour and have few benefits; unionized
janitors earn $7 to $8 and have benefits such as health insurance and pensions.
Justice for Janitors typically targets corporations with household names that
hire their janitors through contractors.

<tt>The US Information Agency modified on February 14, 1995 regulations under
which 10,000 European au pairs enter the US each year.  USIA had proposed
requiring that the weekly stipend be raised from $100 to $155, but reduced the
stipend to $115.  USIA dropped the proposed requirement that au pairs be at
least 21 to care for children under two, and the proposed requirement that they
be limited to nine hours of work daily (the limit is 45 hours weekly).  The au
pair program is scheduled to expire on September 30, 1995.</a></a></a></a></a>

Activities to Deter Illegal
Immigration</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a><a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></h2>
<tt>Prop. 187 in California may have marked a new era in state and local
government activism to reduce illegal immigration.  Virginia is estimating the
number and cost of illegal immigrants in order to seek federal reimbursement,
and Maryland has held hearings on whether English should be the official state
language.</tt><p>
<tt>In Florida, the Orlando-based group Save Our State is planning to put an
initiative on the November 1996 ballot to withhold publicly-funded services
from unauthorized aliens.  It needs 50,000 signatures to have the proposed
constitutional amendment reviewed by the Florida Supreme Court, and 430,000
signatures to put the measure on the ballot.</tt><p>
<tt>In California, a federal judge on March 13 scheduled a trial for September
6, 1995 on the constitutionality of Proposition 187.  The State of California
had sought to have the constitutionality of Proposition 187 determined first in
California state courts.  A bill has been introduced in Congress to require
three rather than one federal judge to agree to issue an injunction to block
the implementation of a voter-approved initiative.</tt><p>
<tt>According to a Los Angeles Times poll that included non-voters and non-US
citizens, most Californians think that the passage of Prop. 187 was a good
thing. Most want Prop. 187 to be implemented immediately; 52 percent want Prop.
187 implemented immediately, while 38 percent do not.  Only Latinos--by 54
percent to 35 percent--do not want Prop. 187 implemented immediately.</tt><p>
<tt>By 53 percent to 40 percent, those questioned thought that passage of Prop.
187 was a "good thing."  Only nine percent of those questioned thought that
there had been a major increase in discrimination since the passage of Prop.
187.</tt><p>
<tt>Yale law professor Peter Schuck reviews the likelihood that the courts will
eventually uphold 187, and notes that there is ample precedent for the US
Supreme Court to uphold or to strike down the proposition.  Schuck believes
that it would be wrong to uphold 187, largely because the optimal level of
illegal immigration is not zero--it costs too much to completely stop
immigration--and so the illegal aliens who inevitably arrive should receive
public education and emergency health care.  </tt><p>
<tt>Schuck also believes that it would be foolish to make ineligible for
welfare benefits legal immigrants in the US, since, he asserts, Congress can
discriminate against legal immigrants in welfare programs, but the states
cannot without Congressional approval, so that a federal ban may wind up simply
increasing state and local costs.</tt><p>
<tt>There are currently four bills before Congress that would declare English
to be the official national language.  Under English-only rules, bilingual
ballots are banned, government documents are printed only in English, and
government workers must speak English at work.  Three of the four bills would
also abolish Bilingual programs in the US Education Department. </tt><p>
<tt>California Governor Pete Wilson announced that he would "explore" seeking
the Republican presidential nomination, and signaled that two of his themes
would be opposition to illegal immigration and affirmative action.  However,
President Clinton responded that "some" who supported Prop. 187 in 1994 to
reduce illegal immigration had laid the ground work for illegal immigration in
1984-85, when Congress approved an "easy" farm worker legalization program that
permitted over half of the mostly young Mexican men who became legal US
immigrants to gain that status fraudulently.  </tt><p>
<tt>If illegal immigration becomes a major issue in the 1996 campaign, the
1983-86 campaign by western growers for a "free agent" guest worker program is
likely to be scrutinized closely.  The kingpin was Rep. Coehlo (D-CA) who
arranged to have former Rep. Panetta, currently Clinton's chief of staff, carry
a bill that would have permitted Mexican workers to enter the US and "float"
from farm to farm as needed.  After the House approved such a program in 1994,
then Senator Wilson persuaded the Senate to approve a similar program in 1985.
</tt><p>
<tt>Unions, churches, and ethnic organizations strongly opposed these
non-immigrant programs, setting the stage for the last-minute compromise in
1986--a legalization program for all unauthorized workers who had a minimal
attachment to US agriculture. </tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC9">California
Farm Workers</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>On March 31, the United Farm Workers Union held events around the nation to
honor the anniversary of the death of UFW founder Cesar Chavez.  </tt><p>
<tt>Farm workers are one of only three US occupations with one million or more
workers in which the majority of workers are immigrants--the other two are
maids and janitors.  There are two to three million farm workers, including
about 800,000 persons who work for wages sometime during each year on
California farms.  About half of these California farm workers might be
considered dependent on farm work for most of their earnings--a typical
California farm worker earns about $5 hourly for about 1,000 hours of work, for
$5,000 in annual farm earnings.</tt><p>
<tt>For over 100 years, most California farm workers have been persons who
could not obtain any other jobs in California, usually because they lacked
English, skills, and contacts.  In 1965, Cesar Chavez organized a strike by
California grape harvesters to protest grower refusal to pay mostly local
workers the same wages that they were required to pay to non-immigrant Mexican
workers and, since the Bracero program ended in 1964, Chavez's United Farm
Workers was able in 1966 to win a 40 percent wage increase.</tt><p>
<tt>In 1975, California became the first major agricultural state to enact a
law that granted farm workers the right to organize into unions, and required
employers to bargain with the union representative elected by workers.  During
the next 20 years, there were about 1,200 elections involving 100,000
workers--the same worker could vote in several elections--but one-third of
these elections were held in the last five months of  1975.</tt><p>
<tt>Immigration marked the rise and fall of the UFW.  In 1980, the UFW asked
for another 40 percent increase.  After a bitter strike that saw growers turn
to  labor contractors who organized crews of often illegal workers to be strike
breakers, the UFW won an Pyretic victory--many companies that agreed to UFW
demands went out of business.  UFW membership fell from a peak of perhaps
60,000 in the late 1970s to as few as 5,000 in the early 1990s.</tt><p>
<tt>The UFW resumed efforts to organize farm workers after Cesar Chavez died in
1993, and in December 1994, the UFW won an election to represent the 1,400
workers employed by Bear Creek, better known as Jackson-Perkins, the rose
company.  On March 17, the UFW negotiated a three- year contract that increases
wages and benefits 22 percent over the life of the contract, sets a $5.82
hourly starting wage, and offers nine paid holidays, including Chavez's March
31 birthday.</tt><p>
<tt>On the eve of the ALRA's 20th anniversary of the ALRA, the state's
Legislative Analyst proposed eliminating the ALRB as an independent agency, and
combining it with the agency that regulates labor relations for public
employees.  The ALRB currently has only two of its authorized five members, and
in 1993-94 its 50 employees certified the results of nine elections and issued
31 Unfair labor Practice complaints.  The UFW protested the inclusion of the
ALRB into the PERB, arguing that it is currently in negotiations with 32 farms
that employ 13,000 farm workers.</tt><p>
<tt>California was battered by storms in January and March 1995--rainfall was
almost twice normal levels--and the rain washed away at least temporarily the
jobs of many immigrant farm workers, especially in Salinas-- the nation's
"Salad Bowl" about one hour south of San Francisco.  The Monterey County
agriculture commissioner, for example, estimated that instead of the usual
40,000 farm workers employed in March in the area, 30,000 acres of flooded
broccoli, cauliflower, and lettuce left only a few thousand employed.
Statewide, losses were estimated at $500 to $600 million, or 2 to 3 percent of
usual annual farm sales of $20 billion.</tt><p>
<tt>However, there should be about the same number of hours worked in
California agriculture in 1995, because farmers will replant vegetables such as
lettuce, and there will be significant clean up work in the state's orchards
and vineyards.  For example, only 600 of the state's 23,000 acres of
strawberries were washed away--less than 3 percent of the acreage.</tt><p>
<tt>There is some question about whether residents of small cities hard hit by
flooding -- Pajaro, Watsonville, and Castroville--will advise friends and
relatives in Mexico to stay there, especially in light of stepped up border
enforcement.  However, with workers in rural Mexico hearing of $5 to $6 hourly
wages in California, versus less than $1 per day in Mexico, many may
nonetheless be tempted to migrate.</tt><p>
<tt>There will be no water shortages to constrain planting in California
agriculture in 1995.  However, the demand for hired farm workers has been
increasing, as farmers shift from low-value and mechanically harvested crops
such to high-value fruits and vegetables that require more labor.</tt><p>
<tt>The Legal Services Corporation, which funds legal services for migrant farm
workers, is threatened once again with budget cuts.  The 1994-95 budget of $415
million for 320 organizations and 4000 lawyers has been slated for elimination
over 5 years, according to one plan of the House Republican leaders.</tt><p>

Immigration and Integration Challenges</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>

<tt>The US and Germany are among the world's major countries of immigration.
The US takes in more immigrants than any other country, and Germany is the
chief destination of refugees and asylum seekers in Europe.  Nothing suggests
the influx of migrants to either country will soon cease.</tt><p>
<tt>Population growth in both countries is fueled by immigration.  In the US
about one-third of population growth is due to immigration; in Germany, 100
percent of the population growth is due to immigration.  About eight percent of
the 260 million US population are foreign-born, and almost nine percent of
Germany's 81 million residents are foreigners.  Some foreign-born residents in
the US are naturalized US citizens, and about one-sixth of Germany's foreigners
were born in Germany (persons born in the US are automatically US citizens;
persons born in Germany acquire the nationality of their parents).</tt><p>
<tt>Successive German governments have taken the position that "Germany is not
a country of immigration."  This is not to be understood as a descriptive
statement, but as a declaration of policy:  it means that Germany does not
invite settlement by foreigners.  The population of resident foreigners is
nonetheless growing, primarily as the result of a continuing influx of asylum
seekers, family unification, and births to foreigners living in Germany.</tt><p>
<tt>Can Germany and the US, despite differences in immigration history and
policy, learn from each other?  A March 28, 1995 conference in Washington DC on
immigration and asylum challenges and choices in Germany and the US, sponsored
by the UC Comparative Immigration and Integration Policy program, the American
Institute for Contemporary German Studies, and the Friedrich Ebert Stiftung,
heard German experts review recent developments, and Americans draw comparisons
with recent US developments.</tt><p>
<tt>Germany and the US offer an interesting comparison.  Germany proclaims that
it does not wish to become a country of immigration, but provides a relatively
generous set of services to legal foreigners.  The US, by contrast, basks in
its immigrant heritage, but provides relatively few public services to help to
integrate newcomers.  </tt><p>
<tt>Managing migration is a tough but not impossible challenge facing
industrial societies, and international comparisons will continue to be
fruitful.  As numbers rise and force action, leaders must be willing to
confront the trade-offs inherent in deciding how to manage immigration and
integration.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Immigration</u>.  The two parts of  Germany have been affected
differently by migration.  The former West Germany added 13 million net
immigrants between 1950 and 1993, while the former East Germany lost five
million residents because emigration exceeded immigration.  The former West
Germany included in 1993 about four in five Germans, and virtually all of the
seven million foreigners in Germany live in the former West Germany.</tt><p>
<tt>Germany is unlikely to remain a country in which foreigners arrive and
remain foreigners.  If a net 400,000 immigrants continued to arrive annually,
Germany would in 2030 have a population of about 90 million, of whom 30 percent
would be foreigners.  Major cities such as Frankfurt, Stuttgart, and Munich,
which are now about one-quarter foreigners, would have populations that were
half or more foreign.  </tt><p>
<tt>Since one in six foreigners in Germany today was born in Germany--1.2
million of seven million--and half have lived in Germany for 10 or more years,
the status quo of foreigners remaining foreigners is not likely to continue.
</tt><p>
<tt><u>Asylum</u>.  Most of the foreigners arriving in Germany over the past
five years seeking to settle have arrived as asylum seekers.  In Germany and
all of the industrial democracies, the majority of asylum applications are
rejected, so that separating genuine and false asylum applicants is a major
objective of all asylum systems.</tt><p>
<tt>When the number of asylum seekers surges, as it did in 1992 in Germany to
about 438,000, the cost of housing, feeding, and deciding asylum cases--some DM
6 to 8 billion or $4 to $5 billion--can equal contributions for development
assistance (Germany provided $7 billion ODA in 1993).</tt><p>
<tt>In 1992-93, there were numerous attacks on foreigners in Germany at a time
when over 1,000 foreigners daily were applying for asylum.  Germany added
resources to speed up the processing of asylum cases, to streamline the system
for determining whether a foreigner was being persecuted for political reasons
in his country of citizenship, and to return to neighboring "safe countries"
asylum seekers who passed through Poland and the Czech Republic en route to
Germany.</tt><p>
<tt>Most observers consider the asylum reform a success.  The number of asylum
applicants fell by three-fourths, reducing the state and local costs of housing
and feeding asylum applicants.  Romanians and Bulgarians learned that it was
not worthwhile attempting to get to Germany and apply for asylum.  There does
not appear to be an offsetting increase in illegal immigration from countries
that were sending asylum seekers.  </tt><p>
<tt>In the early 1990s, the US too faced a huge backlog of asylum
applications--over 400,000 in 1995, representing over 700,000 individuals.  In
January 1995, the US streamlined its system and added more staff to speed up
asylum processing.  In the US today, an applicant applies to one of what will
soon be 327 asylum officers (Germany has 900), and that asylum officer either
grants asylum or refers the case to an immigration judge--a non-INS employee.
Second, asylum applicants must now wait at least 180 days to work legally in
the US.</tt><p>
<tt>Both Germany and the US have invented in-between categories for aliens who
are not eligible for asylum, but who nonetheless are not deported.  The US and
German acronyms--TPS, DED, "tolerated"--reflect the expectation that these
aliens will eventually depart.</tt><p>
<tt>Mass asylum in industrial democracies is a 1980s-1990s phenomenon that has
been confronted with more staff to decide cases quickly, and by restricting
access to the system.  How is the asylum system likely to evolve?  Some believe
that the concept of safe haven will replace resettlement.  Under some notions,
ALL persons requesting asylum would be offered safe haven, perhaps on
extra-territorial islands.  Then, as budgets permit, individual cases would be
heard, and those deemed in need of resettlement would be granted the right to
begin life anew.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Foreign Workers.</u>  Germany recruited guest workers between 1961 and
1973, when their number peaked at 2.6 million, making one in eight workers a
foreigner.  Over the next 15 years, these foreign workers united their families
in Germany, and second and third generation-foreigners joined their parents in
the German work force.  </tt><p>
<tt><u>Immigration in the 1990s</u>.  Germany responded to rising migration
pressures from the east after 1989 with five distinct foreign worker programs
that involve some 350,000 foreigners, and add the equivalent of about 150,000
full-time workers to the German work force.  However, unlike 1960s guest worker
programs, 1990s foreign worker programs have a different purpose--to cope with
micro rather than macro labor shortages, and to make inevitable migration
legal.  German foreign worker programs today also have different incentives for
the workers involved; the emphasis is on ensuring return to their countries of
origin.</tt><p>
<tt>The most important program involves project-tied workers.  Under this
program, German firms sub-contract with foreign firms, and the foreign firm
supplies the expertise and workers to complete a particular phase of a project.
There were an average 40,000 project-tied foreign workers in Germany in 1994,
down from 60,000 in 1992 because of scandals that involved German contractors
using project-tied agreements as backdoor guest worker programs.</tt><p>
<tt>Most newly-arrived foreign workers are employed seasonally in Germany.  A
peak 150,000 seasonal foreign workers in 1994 contributed the equivalent of
40,000 FTE to the German labor force.  Seasonal foreign workers can remain 90
days in Germany, and most are employed in agriculture, restaurants, or
construction.  If the workers are employed less than two months, the workers
and their employers do not have to pay social security taxes on their
wages.</tt><p>
<tt>The third program is for border commuters from the Czech Republic and
Poland.  If local workers are not available in Germany within 50 km of these
eastern borders, then employers can request permission from the German
Employment Service to employ commuter workers at prevailing wages who can
remain in Germany for up to two nights weekly.</tt><p>
<tt>The fourth program permits about 6,000 young East Europeans to work and
learn in Germany for up to 18 months, although evaluations indicate that
Czechs, Poles, and other East Europeans learn few skills in Germany that they
use at home.  Finally, about 1,000 nurses from the former Yugoslavia are
allowed to work in Germany.  </tt><p>
<tt>In both the US and Germany, there has been a shift in the rationale for
temporary foreign worker programs.  Instead of recruiting foreign workers to
deal with macro or widespread labor shortages, most programs today are
justified as a way to deal with a micro labor shortage, or to channel into
legal programs inevitable and otherwise illegal migrants.  </tt><p>
<tt>However, most of the industrial democracies have heeded the advice of the
OECD and deregulated their labor markets, and most today play less of a
job-matching role in labor markets.  The German ES matches about 35 percent of
all job seekers and jobs, the US ES three to four percent--giving governments
less credibility when considering employer requests for foreign workers.</tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC11">Muslim
Immigrants in
France</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>There are three to five million Muslims in France, including one million
who are French citizens.  There have been Muslims in France since the beginning
of the 20th century, but it was only in 1967 that their number topped one
million.</tt><p>
<tt>France on January 1, 1994 had 58 million residents.  The French population
has been increasing by about 400,000 annually, due to 300,000 more births than
deaths, and 100,000 immigrants.  Half of all French immigrants, and 40 percent
of the asylum seekers, are from Africa.</tt><p>
<tt>In the past, France had an assimilationist attitude toward
immigration--immigrants were expected to learn French and to conform to French
values in public.  Muslims have begun to challenge assimilation just as France,
like other industrial countries, is debating the best way to integrate minority
immigrants.  </tt><p>
<tt>In Fall 1994, the French government officially banned girls who wear
"ostentatious" headscarves from attending public schools.  Some Islamic
associations immediately attacked the headscarf ban as a symbol of French
intolerance for minorities; 22 percent of the Muslims polled in October 1994
thought that Muslim girls should be allowed to wear headscarves to school.
One-third of the Muslims polled agreed that integration into French society
means that an individual becomes less Muslim.</tt><p>
<tt>Muslim girls in France face special challenges.  At home, boys are favored,
but in school, Muslim girls reportedly do better than Muslim boys because they
are treated more equally than at home.  Many Muslim families reportedly arrange
marriages for their daughters at age 18 and, if the girl objects, she sometimes
must make a break from her family.  Other girls go to the other extreme,
becoming fundamentalist to gain power within their families.</tt><p>
<tt>On March 21, the National Consultative Commission on Human Rights issued
its annual report on human rights in France.  The report expressed alarm over
the continued spread of intolerance toward foreigners, especially toward those
of North African origin.  The Commission reiterated its criticisms of a series
of laws passed in 1993 tightening controls on immigration and restricting
access to the French nationality.</tt><p>
<tt>One of the laws passed in 1993 tightened the regulations on marriages
between immigrants and French citizens.  Immigrants married for more than one
year to a French citizen, or who are parents of a child born in France,
generally cannot be deported.  Previously, the government granted long-term
residence cards to such immigrants.  Under the 1993 law, the government rarely
grants work, study or residence permits.<b>  </b></tt><p>
<tt><b></b>The two-year-old law, according to a government spokesperson, was
designed to stop marriages of convenience.  Mayors have the power to review
marriage applications and refuse those they think are for convenience.  An
organization called Lune de Miel says that the law has left many partners in
honest marriages between an immigrant and French citizen without access to
social services and employment. </tt><p>
<tt>French authorities are continuing to stop dark-skinned men to check their
documentation.  The random checks began in fall 1994 after five French citizens
were slain in Algeria.  French authorities worry that the violence plaguing
Algeria will move to France.  After the hijacking of an Air France plane from
Algiers, French citizens backed the crackdown. </tt><p>
<tt>"The zero generation" is a term coined to describe the French born-children
of immigrants parents, who have no opportunities due to a stagnant French
economy.  They are frequently turning to fundamentalism.  </tt><p>
<tt>In Algeria, a civil war between Islamic fundamentalists and the military
government threatened to add to the 800,000 Algerians and three million French
citizens of Algerian origin in France.  </tt><p>
<tt>Algeria, which  has 28 million people and a per capita GDP of $1800, won
its independence from France in 1962.   A new 1989 constitution permitted
political parties to contest elections but, when it appeared that
fundamentalists would win the<b> </b>general election, the government annulled
the election, with the support of the French government.  </tt><p>
<tt>Since then, there has been fighting between Islamic militants and
government troops, and 300 to 600 militants headed to Algiers were reportedly
killed by government troops in an ambush near the end of March.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC12">Britain
Considers</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a> Tightening Asylum Rules, Employer
Sanctions</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>The British Parliament will be considering new laws to toughen controls on
asylum seekers and visa overstayers.  Proponents of the legislation argue that
Heathrow Airport has become a magnet for asylum seekers.  The proposed reforms
seek to ally the concerns expressed by Euro-skeptic MPs that "EU laws would
dismantle Britain's [immigration] controls."</tt><p>
<tt>The immigration bill being prepared by Home Secretary Michael Howard
responds to critics who assert that current controls fail to combat illegal
immigration and that European integration will worsen the problem of "backdoor"
immigration.  If enacted, Britain would introduce sanctions on employers of
illegal immigrants, removing the right to oral hearings for those asylum
seekers whose claims are without foundation, increasing the countries to which
visa restrictions apply, and publishing a list of safe third countries to which
rejected asylum seekers could be sent.  </tt><p>
<tt>Additionally, a reduction in benefits payable to asylum seekers is part of
the proposed reform to combat illegal immigration.  Last year, 50,000 asylum
seekers waiting for their applications to be processed received Social Security
benefits.</tt><p>
<tt>The impetus for the proposed benefits reductions stems from the growth in
the backlog of applications awaiting decision, from 5,060 in 1985 to 55,000
last year.  Allegations that 80 percent of the asylum applications are bogus
further fuels the drive for reform.  Proponents argue that cutting benefits
will send an important message to bogus asylum claimants.</tt><p>
<tt>Under the proposal to fine employers of illegal immigrants, employers would
have to check national insurance numbers - or social security ID cards - before
employing someone.</tt><p>
<tt>The British Department of Employment reports that 864,000 foreigners were
employed legally in Britain in  spring 1994, and they were three percent of the
overall labor force.  Of the two million foreigners in the country, 44 percent
were employed.  </tt><p>
<tt>Foreign workers in Britain are grouped at the ends of the skill
spectrum--they tend to be more or less skilled the labor force as a whole.  The
professionals, managers, and technical workers are often in Britain because of
corporate transfers.</tt><p>
<tt>The lower skilled foreigners are more likely than Britons to work in
labor-intensive industries, such as hotels, restaurants, distribution and
repairs.  The Irish Republic has been a traditional source of immigrant
labor--over 200,000 Irish workers are employed in Britain, as well as 15,000
Germans. </tt><p>
<tt>Britain is the only country that conducts DNA tests to see if a child being
brought into the country for family reunification is indeed the claimant's
child.  The tests are most frequently used for those coming from South Asia and
Africa.  Applicants have the right to refuse the test. </tt><p>
<tt>Last year the British High Commission in Islamabad carried out 833 genetic
tests on Pakistanis trying to send children and other relatives to Britain.  In
an effort to keep track of the complicated strands of Muslim family life, where
one man may have several wives, British embassy officials in maintain about
280,000 files on Pakistani families with British ties going back to the 1950s.
Each applicant is asked to draw up a family tree, which is in
computerized.</tt><p>

<tt>On March 26, 1995, the seven Schengen countries of Germany, France, Spain,
Portugal and the three Benelux countries abolished border controls between
themselves.  These countries have established the Schengen Information System
in Strasbourg, simplified extradition arrangements, and agreed on a list of
countries from which visas will be required to enter any Schengen member
country.  Britain threatened to veto any attempt to mandate the extension of
the Schengen agreement to all EU states.</tt><p>
<tt>The traveling public noticed little change because most of the land borders
shared by the seven countries had been reduced or eliminated since customs
checks ended on January 1, 1993 with the launching of the single European
market. The main impact of the Schengen changes will be felt at airports, which
will make a distinction between passengers arriving from within the Schengen
area and those flying in from outside.  Hence, flights between Munich and Paris
will be able treated domestic trips, and passengers will be able to travel
without their passports.</tt><p>
<tt>On March 26, 1995, 30 Ghanaians who were being deported walked unchallenged
through the barriers at Amsterdam's Schipol airport.  Another 80 were stopped
by immigration officials.  The Ghanaians were given "smart cards, "on a flight
from Brussels to Amsterdam, where they were to catch a connecting flight to
Africa.  The Belgian police thought the Ghanaians would be held in the transit
area, as happened in the past.</tt><p>
<tt>There are believed to be 3.5 to 5.5 million illegal aliens among the EU's
372 million residents, meaning that 1 to 1.5 percent of the EU population are
unauthorized foreigners.  The French in October 1994 established a 6,200 member
police force to reduce the number of illegal immigrants.</tt><p>
<tt>Germany tightened border security along the eastern frontier to prevent
illegal immigration. But, the feared hordes of Poles flooding Germany failed to
materialize.  </tt><p>
<tt>Germany launched a crackdown--putting up traffic checkpoints--on its
western frontier with France, Belgium, and the Netherlands on January 1, 1995
that resulted in the apprehension of 900 illegal aliens in two months.  Many
were Albanians who had paid $1,300 to $2,000 to be taken by ferry to Italy,
then to France, and finally to Germany.  </tt><p>
<tt>A report noting that despite EU promotion of the four freedoms--the freedom
of movement of goods, capital, services, and labor-- less than two percent of
the EU nationals live in another EU nation, prompted one reporter to assert
that abolishing US border controls would solve the immigration control problem
and "would produce no new tidal wave of the poor into Texas, Arizona and
California."  </tt><p>
<tt>The major basis of this conclusion is that most people do not move.
According to some Europeans, ''The real [immigration] controls are complicated
things like cultural traditions and language, not the physical barriers between
countries.'' </tt><p>
<tt>From 1987 to 1991, approximately 1.5 million people moved from one
member-state to another.  Much of the movement has been the north-south
movement of retirees--for example, 29,000 Spaniards have moved to the UK, while
86,000 Britons have moved to Spain.  With a projected 75 million retirees by
the year 2000, some predict more north to south migration.  </tt><p>
<tt>Denmark was the wealthiest EU nation in 1991--its per capita GDP of $23,660
was four times Portugal's $5,620. </tt><p>

<tt>Relations between Greece and Albania soured again at the end of March after
a report that Greek border guards shot and killed an Albanian man who had
crossed into Greece illegally and ignored warning shots while returning.  The
Greek government denied that the shooting occurred. </tt><p>

designed to repair relations after Greece expelled 70,000 Albanians in 1994 in
retaliation for Albania sentencing several ethnic Greeks to death for spying.
There are about 400,000 ethnic Greeks among Albania's three million people.
</tt><p>
<tt>Greece and Albania agreed to establish a program under which Albanians can
work seasonally in Greece.  They also agreed to consider opening a Greek bank
branch in Tirana to facilitate the transfer of remittances from Albanian
workers in Greece.</tt><p>
<tt>Albania is the poorest country in Europe.  According to the government,
unemployment is 30 percent, although some Albanians claim it is 80 percent.
There is running water only three times per day and the electricity supply is
sporadic.  </tt><p>
<tt>According to a poll by a Tirana professor, 82 percent of Albanians would
leave the country if they could, and only Germany has agreed to accept a few
hundred Albanian emigrants.  Malaysia is the only country to allow Albanians to
enter without a visa.</tt><p>
<tt>On March 26, police dispersed 1,200 youth in Tirana who had assembled
outside the US Embassy after a newspaper falsely reported that the US was
offering work visas.  A similar incident occurred three days earlier.</tt><p>
<tt>On the streets of the Albanian capital of Tirana, counterfeit passports
sell for about $US 5,000.  A visa to Italy is about $US 1,500.  Families
purchase the documents with their life savings --the average income in Albania
is less than $US 400 per year.  If they cannot afford false documents,
Albanians go to Vlora to catch a $US 500 to $US 1,000 three-hour boat ride to
Italy, where taxis wait to take them to the train station. </tt><p>
<tt>Italian border police report that 11,000 ethnic Albanians from the Kosovo
province in Serbia have vanished after arriving legally in the country.  Border
police speculate that they moved on to France and Germany.  Citizens of former
Yugoslavia, including Kosovo Albanians, do not need visas to enter
Italy.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC15">Turkey
and Germany Struggle with Racial Tensions</a>
</a></h2>
<tt>In Turkey, there are fears that fundamentalist-government tension, plus an
internal struggle over Kurdish separatism, could lead to mass
emigration.</tt><p>
<tt>Turkey is a country of 60 million that has been knocking on Europe's door
since 1987, when Turkey formally applied to join the EU.  Turkey's application
was rebuffed in 1989, but on March 6, 1995, Turkey and the EU signed a customs
union that will free up trade beginning in 1996.  </tt><p>
<tt>If the agreement is approved by the EU Parliament, Turkey would receive
about $900 million in aid over several years.  However, members of the EU
Parliament have threatened to withhold approval of the agreement because of
Turkey's treatment of its Kurdish minority.</tt><p>
<tt>There are also fears that fundamentalists could come to power in Turkey, or
that a fundamentalist-secular split could plunge the country into civil war.
The conflicts within Turkey are already mirrored in disputes among the two
million Turks in Germany.</tt><p>
<tt>There are about two million Turks in Germany, including about 400,000
Kurds, 400,000 to 600,000 Alawites, and 1 million ethnic Turks.  Germany
estimates that about 35,000 of the Turks in the country are fundamentalists,
extremists, or PKK militants.   </tt><p>
<tt>Germany has several times suspended the deportation of Kurds because of
Turkey's alleged violations of Kurdish human rights, but at the same time, the
German government has sold weapons to the Turkish government.  On March 20,
Turkey sent 35,000 troops across the Iraqi border in an effort to wipe out
Kurdish bases there.</tt><p>
<tt>In March there was a wave of firebombings of Turkish mosques, travel
agencies and cultural centers.  Unlike previous violence of Germans attacking
foreigners, these firebombings are the result of the divisions between Turks.
German authorities believe that most of the attacks are led by the separatist
Kurdish Workers Party (PKK).  Some Turks believe that there is tacit German
solidarity with the Kurds, and that the German authorities were not doing
enough to protect Turks from Kurds in Germany.</tt><p>
<tt>In Germany, the attacks on Turks are reportedly convincing more Germans
that the Turks will not be easily integrated into German society.   On March
15, the German government decided to resume the deportation of illegal Kurdish
immigrants and rejected asylum seekers, after a Parliamentary committee heard
17 witnesses testify that Turkey generally does protect the rights of Kurds and
all other Turkish residents.  Even though 11 of Germany's 16 foreigners'
commissioners asked that the moratorium on deportations be extended, the
Foreign Ministry and the Turkish government argued that even Turks accused of
criminal conduct in Turkey who are returned have their legal rights
protected.</tt><p>
<tt>Deportations are the responsibility of the state governments, and the 11
SPD-ruled states announced that they would continue to not to expel
Kurds.</tt><p>
<tt>Violence against Turks appears to be moving to Switzerland following
firebombings aimed at several Turkish travel agencies in several northern Swiss
towns.  In Basle, Kurdish protesters fought with police after a Kurdish
cultural center was closed.  In Zurich, Turkish Moslem Alawites and Turkish and
Kurdish communists staged separate demonstrations to protest police violence in
Istanbul and Ankara, and the Turkish army's drive against Kurdish separatists.
Similar marches were held in German, Austrian and French cities on March 18.

<a name="RTFToC17">Philippines
to Restrict Overseas
Workers</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>The Philippines has instituted rules to limit the numbers of workers
overseas because of mistreatment of Filipino workers abroad.  The Philippines
is among the world's top labor exporting countries, with an estimated 2 to 3.5
million Filipinos working in some 140 nations as construction workers,
domestic helpers, entertainers, crew members on ships, hotel employees,
teachers and office clerks.  </tt><p>
<tt>In 1994, Filipino overseas workers sent home some $2.4 billion through
formal channels, up from 1993 remittances of $2.2 billion.  The economic impact
of these remittances in the Philippines is believed to be over $8 billion
annually, or one-sixth of the Philippines $52 billion GDP.</tt><p>
<tt>On March 17, 1995, Singapore hanged a 42 year-old Filipina maid for killing
in 1991 another maid and a child.  Her case became a cause celebre in the
Philippines after two other Filipinos argued that she was framed.  </tt><p>
<tt>Philippine President Ramos asked that the execution be postponed and, when
it was not, the Singaporean Prime Minister was forced to postpone a scheduled
trip to Manila.  There are about 75,000 Filipinos working in Singapore, most as
maids, and on March 26, 1995, there were massive demonstrations throughout the
Philippines to protest harsh treatment of Filipinos in Singapore.  As public
resentment swelled, President Ramos recalled the Philippine ambassador and
banned Filipinas from going to work in Singapore.  </tt><p>
<tt>The maid's March 26, 1995 funeral march turned into a massive demonstration
against Singapore for executing the maid, and against the Filipino government
for failing to protect Filipino workers abroad.  Some reports compared the
emotional outpouring for the executed maid to the 1986 revolt that led to the
end of the Marcos government.</tt><p>
<tt>Philippine President Ramos ordered the evacuation of Filipina maids who
wanted to leave Singapore and sent military aircraft on March 29 to fly home 83
Filipina maids.  Most of the maids who signed up for the flight home claimed
they were mistreated by their Singaporean employers or were homesick.  Several
days later, Ramos extended the invitation to return home at government expense
to overseas workers in other countries. </tt><p>
<tt>The hanging of the Filipina maid in Singapore has reopened a debate over
how to protect Filipino migrant workers abroad.  Every year, reportedly
"hundreds" of Filipino migrant workers return in coffins, usually as a result
of workplace accidents, but also for violating other countries' laws.</tt><p>
<tt>The Middle East and Singapore are among the places most frequently cited as
abusing Filipino workers.  The Philippines has been pushing for a
U.N.-sponsored global conference on labor migration.  The Philippines sponsored
a resolution in the United Nations seeking more protections for migrant
workers.  </tt><p>
<tt>Most Asian labor-importing nations object to more migrant worker
protections.</tt><p>
<tt>A high level Thai official called for an agreement on the free movement of
labor after the hanging of the Filipina maid.  Such an agreement would give
ASEAN member countries a framework upon which to base uniform rules for the
protection of workers' rights.  The issue is expected to be raised at an
informal meeting of ASEAN economic ministers in April 1995. </tt><p>
<tt>In 1994, the Philippine government required Singaporean recruitment
agencies to post a $4,000 bond for every 50 domestic helpers they recruited in
the Philippines.  Manila says the bond will be put in escrow and used to help
maids who have been abused in Singapore. </tt><p>
<tt>The Department of Labor and Employment has also started an accreditation
scheme for foreign employers.  DOLE reports that domestic helpers in Japan can
earn $ 1,200 a month compared to $200 monthly in Saudi Arabia.</tt><p>
<tt>Following pressure after the hanging of the Filipina maid in Singapore,
President Ramos appealed for clemency for a Filipino worker sentenced to die
for murder in the United Arab Emirates.  The Philippine leader has also ordered
full legal assistance to another Filipina domestic being tried in the UAE for
murdering her employer, who had allegedly raped her.</tt><p>
<tt>Filipina maids in Hong Kong are worried that as the colony prepares to be
turned over to China, they will lose their jobs.  Chinese government officials
have given no official response to the question of whether Filipina maids will
be able to be employed in Hong Kong after 1997.  There are about 100,000
Filipina maids in Hong Kong, earning an $US 485 per month.  The average per
capita income in the Philippines was $770 yearly in 1992.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC18">Korean
Guest Workers</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>The Korean government has launched a program to 'internationalize' Korea's
insular and homogeneous society.  However, its attempts to use foreign trainees
to curb labor shortages in Korea and provide the training needed to accelerate
development in labor-surplus countries got off to a rough start.  </tt><p>
<tt>In January 1995, Nepalese factory trainees held a nine-day sit-in at
Seoul's Myongdong Cathedral, complaining that the trainee program begun in
1993, and administered by the Korea Federation of Small Business, was really a
slave labor program.  In January 1995, trainees were 19,000 of the 33,600
foreigners legally working in Korea.  Most were from China, the Philippines,
and India and Pakistan.</tt><p>
<tt>A survey by of 185 workers at an industrial complex in Seoul indicate that
42 percent were beaten.  </tt><p>
<tt>Beginning in 1996, Korea plans to admit legal foreign workers--not
trainees--who will have contracts and be guaranteed the same wages as Korean
workers.  Korea hopes to control illegal alien workers, who number about
50,000, by<b> </b>1999.  The government will increase the number of foreign
industrial and trainee-workers to fill the gap in the industrial work force
that results from the deportation of illegal workers. </tt><p>
<tt>The policy is based on the belief that the only way to fundamentally
resolve the controversial issue of illegal foreign workers would be to
eliminate foreign workers who overstay their visits and to improve the foreign
trainee system.  However, small industries depend heavily on illegal foreign
workers who overstay their visits, and the labor ministry plans to reduce their
number by deporting about 10,000 a year through 1999.</tt><p>
<tt>Immigration data indicate that overstaying foreign workers totaled 49,800
as of the end of January, 1995.  They include 19,800 Korean-Chinese, 7,500
Filipinos, 5,000 Bangladeshis, 2,300 Pakistanis and 2,000 Nepalese.  A total of
4,422 illegal foreign workers were deported in 1994, 894 of them forcibly and
3,528 voluntarily after they received exit orders.</tt><p>
<tt>Two Korean government agencies disagree on the employment and management of
foreign workers.  The Ministry of Labor is trying pass special laws to employ
and manage foreign workers, but the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy is
opposed to any law, saying it will impose a burden on smaller companies.
</tt><p>
<tt>The Labor ministry has announced that, despite protests, it will introduce
a minimum wage system for foreign trainees in Korea.  However, a minimum wage
might encourage some employers to reduce their outlays for lodging and boarding
of foreign workers. </tt><p>
<tt>The technical trainees earn about US$20 per month.  Many prefer to work
illegally, since they can earn US$450 per month. </tt><p>

<tt>A profile of Asian professionals in the US who are returning to Taiwan,
Korea, India, and other Asian countries of citizenship suggests that a
combination of economic growth that has narrowed income gaps, new private
investment in high-tech industries, and government policies that subsidize
returns has persuaded thousands of engineers and financial professionals to
return to their countries of origin.  Emigration from the US is estimated to be
about 200,000 of the estimated 850,000 immigrants arriving  annually in the
early 1990s, suggesting that emigration is about 25 percent of
immigration.</tt><p>
<tt>An OCAC survey on ROC nationals who have migrated to the United States
shows that 27 percent have done so for business reasons, 21 percent have gone
for the sake of their children's education, and another 10 percent said they
migrated to continue their own advanced studies.  Only 14 percent said they
emigrated due to the low quality of life in Taiwan, and 9 percent said they
chose to emigrate because of the poor social security situation in Taiwan.
</tt><p>
<tt>Another 8 percent said their motive for emigrating was their fear of a
communist Chinese invasion, 7 percent said they were wary of the unstable
political situation, and 5 percent said they wanted to live with other family
members in the United States.  </tt><p>
<tt>The report says that the United States, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, and
South Africa are the top five countries of destination for Taiwanese emigrants.
Data from the five countries show that 21,166 ROC citizens emigrated to those
countries in 1990; 19,988 in 1991; 21,580 in 1992, and 22,081 in 1993.  </tt><p>
<tt>The emigration rates of Taiwanese to the five countries are related to
those countries' immigration policies.  Stricter immigration policies adopted
by the US, Canada, and Australia are expected to slow the number of immigrants
from Taiwan, while the relatively more relaxed immigration rules of New Zealand
will prompt more Taiwan people to seek residency there. In addition, the
Interior Ministry is planning to establish an emigration agency.  </tt><p>
<tt>Many of the returning Asian professionals studied in the US, and were
offered jobs upon graduation by US employers.  With prospects for using their
training at home in modern labs dim, many stayed in the US.  In the 1990s,
however, US aerospace, financial, and other industries sharply reduced
employment, while such industries boomed in Asia.</tt><p>
<tt>Most of the Asians are returning in what Taiwan calls rencai huiliu--return
flow of human talent--accept pay cuts of 30 to 40 percent in exchange for being
closer to aging parents and relatives and what they see as better prospects for
upward mobility.</tt><p>
<tt>In a bid to attract more professionals and investment capital from Hong
Kong and Macao, Taiwan has relaxed its immigration rules.  Investment
requirements have been lowered from $US 384,000 to $US 192,307; investors must
remain in Taiwan for 21 out of 24 months.  The new rules must be approved by
the Cabinet. </tt><p>

<tt>More than 800,000 Vietnamese have been housed at least temporarily in camps
in southeast Asian camps since 1975, and 46,000 remain there.  Half are in Hong
Kong and the rest are scattered throughout Southeast Asia.</tt><p>
<tt>As countries such as the Philippines begin to force the remaining
Vietnamese to return home, scenes such as that near Manila--where Filipino
police had to prevent Vietnamese from committing suicide as they were being
moved to an island in preparation for their return to Vietnam--are likely to
become more common. British officials are skeptical that Vietnam can meet the
timetable to prepare for the return in 12 months of the 22,000 boat people in
Hong Kong.</tt><p>
<tt>Most of the Vietnamese in the Filipino camps left Vietnam in boats in the
past eight years to take advantage of a US program that offered US citizenship
to Amerasian children of American soldiers.  The Vietnamese were in a program
allowing them to emigrate to the US after cultural training and English at the
camp.  </tt><p>
<tt>US officials concluded that virtually all of the documentation of the
remaining Vietnamese in the Philippines is false, so they were denied entry
into the US.  The UN closed the camp in which they live on December 31,
1994.</tt><p>
<tt>The US has offered to pay repatriation costs for the 272 boat people but
has encountered difficulties negotiating with the Vietnamese government.  The
UNHCR has requested that countries donate $74 million for the repatriation of
the Vietnamese.</tt><p>
<tt>A World Bank report says that 51 percent of the Vietnamese population lives
in poverty.  The Vietnamese economy is growing at eight percent per year, and
the World Bank estimates that poverty will have fallen by 29 percent by
2000.</tt><p>
<tt>The Vietnamese community in Australia had begun a campaign to persuade the
Australian government to assist boat people in overseas refugee camps. The
campaign has been sparked by fears in the international Vietnamese community
that genuine refugees will be forcibly returned to Vietnam and face persecution
or death.</tt><p>

at the Social
Summit</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></h2>
<tt>The 20,000 delegates from 120 nations gathered in Copenhagen spent $30 to
$60 million to discuss ways to reduce the poverty that afflicts 1.3 billion
people--almost 1 in 4 persons worldwide lives on less than $1 per day.
Underlying the discussion of ways to alleviate suffering was, for some
countries, fears of uncontrolled migration and environmental degradation.
</tt><p>
<tt>Prime Minister Rasmussen of Denmark laid out a "very concrete" argument to
use with "ordinary people" to justify aid to emigration countries:  "if you
don't help the Third World...then you will have these poor people in our
society."  Since "Europe has now lived through a period where thousands and
thousands and thousands of refugees are coming from various parts of the
world...ordinary people now recognize ...the global situation."</tt><p>
<tt>The challenge is daunting.  About 20 percent of the world's population is
very poor, 70 percent of the poor are women, and poor nations owe $1.4 trillion
in debt.  Industrial nations urged poor nations to follow market-oriented
economic polices and to extirpate corruption and guarantee basic human rights.
Poor countries countered that their debts should be canceled, and that aid
should come without strings.</tt><p>
<tt>The Group of 77--130 developing nations--asked industrial country donors to
adopt a 20-20 formula--20 percent of their aid would be earmarked for basic
human needs such as schools and hospitals, and recipient countries would also
commit 20 percent of their government expenditures to basic human needs.  If
implemented, industrial countries would have to triple their spending on basic
human needs, and poor countries double their spending.</tt><p>
<tt>According to economists, the gap between the richest 20 percent and the
poorest 20 percent of the world's population has doubled since the 1960s.  Many
of the 1,050 citizen groups that ran a parallel conference criticized the UN
parley as filled with rhetoric but few concrete plans.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC23">Venezuela
Rounds Up Colombian Illegal
Immigrants</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>Venezuelan soldiers rounded up abut 1,000 illegal Colombian immigrants in a
border area, burned their homes and crops, and deported them to Colombia.  The
expulsions were a reprisal for a raid by Colombian guerrillas that killed eight
Venezuelan marines.</tt><p>
<tt>The Colombian government demanded that Venezuela compensate the Colombian
farmers who were deported.  The Venezuelan government rejected the demands and
reinforced the border area.  The government said it plans to deport another
2,500 Colombians in the near future. </tt><p>
<tt>Colombia and Venezuela share a 1,378 mile border that has been the frequent
site of border skirmishes between the two countries.  An estimated 1.5 million
undocumented Colombian immigrants are in Venezuela.  Colombian guerrillas have
attacked Venezuelan military installations about 50 times, killing 30
Venezuelan soldiers.  During the last half of 1994, about 3,600 cars stolen
from Venezuelans were taken to Colombia.  Virtually all of the three tons of
cocaine confiscated in Venezuela last year came from  Colombia.</tt><p>
<tt>Venezuela is now demanding the right of "hot pursuit" to chase Colombian
guerrillas across the border.  A Colombian public opinion poll conducted the
week of March 5 found that 96 percent of the respondents oppose allowing
Venezuelan soldiers to enter Colombia. </tt><p>

Migration
Bill</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a> 
</a></h2>
<tt>The Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (no 2) 1995, if approved, will
prevent Chinese boat people from applying for refugee status on the grounds
that China is a safe "third country."  An additional amendment to prevent
Chinese boat people from claiming refugee status in Australia on the grounds of
their country's one-child policy is expected to be included in the package.
</tt><p>
<tt>The proposed law has sparked bitter criticism from Australia's Asian
communities, human rights groups, and the Catholic Church, and prompted the
country's longest-serving politician to threaten to resign if it is
passed.</tt><p>
<tt>The bill was introduced by Immigration Minister Nick Bolkus to counter the
threatened flood of boat people.  He explained that the bill was needed to
"ensure that unauthorized arrivals are not able to abuse the system." </tt><p>
<tt>These reforms come three years after Minister Gerry Hand introduced the
Migration Reform Act of 1992.  The Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs
annual report for 1993-94 found that its refugee decision-making process was
working effectively. </tt><p>
<tt>The opposition indicated that it will support the amended bill if it
ensured that people who had "direct" fears of persecution under the one-child
policy would be allowed to apply for asylum.</tt><p>
<tt>Targeting the Sino-Vietnamese as potential abusers of the refugee system is
surprising, considering their unusually high recognition as refugees.  UNHCR
commented that such restrictive measures may prevent genuine refugees from
access to asylum.</tt><p>
<tt>Following the arrival of 106 asylum seekers from China, the Australian
government is bracing for another possible influx if illegal boat people.  The
Australian facilities are currently full and any more arrivals will be housed
at a air force base in the western part of the country. </tt><p>
<tt>Australia has signed a memorandum of understanding with China under which
the Australian government has agreed to pay for the transport of boat people
back to China -- if they do not succeed in their attempts to gain asylum -- and
some of their repatriation costs.  Under one proposal, asylum would be refused
if an applicant already had the protection of another country.</tt><p>
<tt>In mid-March, Australia announced that foreigners who deposit $550,000 in
government securities for at least three years can become legal immigrants.
About 2,100 of the 76,000 slots available to immigrants in 1995 have been
reserved for such investors, and 15,000 immigrants have come to Australia under
such investor programs since 1981.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC2">Illegal
Immigration</a></a></a></a>
Pressures</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
Illegal immigration appears to be increasing, as indicated by surveys in Mexico
of persons intending to emigrate, apprehension data, and reports from US
employers and social service agencies.  Compared to year earlier levels,
apprehensions along the US-Mexican border were up 10 percent in January, 38
percent in February, and 40 percent in March 1995. There has also been a 38
percent increase in people trying to enter through ports of entry using false
documents and false claims of US citizenship.<p>
Apprehensions totaled 512,000 in the first six months of FY95, up 15 percent
over FY94.  About one million illegal aliens were apprehended in FY94,
including 65 percent in San Diego and El Paso, and another 15 percent in the
Tucson and south Texas areas.  The Border Patrol plans to add almost 3,000
agents over the next three years, so that it has 7,000 agents in 1998.<p>
Mexico acknowledged that 750,000 of its 26 million workers lost their jobs in
January-February 1995, almost double earlier predictions of layoffs in the
aftermath of the peso devaluation.  Another 400,0000 to 600,000 workers are
expected to be laid off in 1995.  <p>
President Zedillo, in an April 5 speech, acknowledged rising illegal emigration
pressures, and promised Mexican action against "those who, in violation of
Mexican laws and human dignity, traffic in human beings."  Zedillo also blasted
Prop. 187.<p>
The US added Mexico and other Latin American countries whose immigrants may
travel to the US via Mexico to Operation Distant Shores.  Distant Shores was
begun to deal with the threat of mass immigration developed in 1994 for the
Cuban and Haitian immigration emergencies.  <p>
Under Distant Shores, abandoned US military bases are used to hold illegal
immigrants temporarily.  While they await processing and extradition, the Army
provides logistical support, such as transportation, food and medical aid.  In
the event of a presidential declaration of an immigration emergency, the
Federal Emergency Management Agency is directed to coordinate the activities of
various federal agencies, including the INS and the military.<p>
On April 6, the INS released its six month evaluation of Operation Gatekeeper,
the strategy begun October 1, 1994 that arrayed three lines of agents along the
US-Mexican border south of San Diego in an effort to prevent illegal aliens
from eluding apprehension.  Each of the 170,000 aliens apprehended between
October 1, 1994 and March 31, 1995 was fingerprinted and photographed, enabling
the INS to determine that about 20 percent of those apprehended were being
caught for the second time.  <p>
These recidivism data also show clearly that the INS has succeeded in pushing
aliens to the east; aliens who were caught in the westernmost section of the
border are being apprehended on their second and third entry attempts five to
10 miles further east.  Apprehensions in the westernmost section fell 50
percent since October 1994 and, according to the INS, "entries" fell by 40
percent.<p>
Border-area residents report fewer trespassers and stolen autos, but residents
further east are complaining that aliens attempting illegal entry there are
leading to litter and auto theft there.<p>
House Republicans led by Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-CA) are demanding that the INS
put enough agents on the San Diego border to create an El-Paso like "human
blockade" on the border.  Hunter is also demanding more fencing and ditches.<p>
Activists in San Diego allege that fingerprinting and photographing apprehended
aliens makes them fearful to report instances of agent abuse against them.
Some activists allege that up to 30 percent of those apprehended are abused at
the hands of the Border Patrol.  <p>
Human Rights Watch-Americas advocated in April the creation of an independent
commission to receive and investigate allegations against Border Patrol agents.
A Citizens Advisory Panel met for the first time on April 12, 1995 to consider
ways to deal with and reduce complaints about INS agents.  An average 220
complaints against INS agents each year have been referred to the Justice
Department's civil rights division--the INS notes that there is about one
complaint per 17,000 apprehensions.<p>
In Los Angeles, the Mexican Consul on April 11, 1995, held a press conference
to express alarm at what he termed a criminal justice system biased against
Latinos.  Los Angeles police and sheriffs responded that each case of alleged
anti-Latino bias must be considered individually.<p>
It will not be clear until the summer of 1995 whether Operation Gatekeeper and
similar efforts to use more and redeployed Border Patrol agents have succeeded
in reducing illegal immigration.  Reports from Mexico suggest that Mexicans are
aware that Gatekeeper has made it more difficult and expensive to enter the US,
but "going north" has become such an integral part of life in especially rural
Mexico that few potential migrants are deterred.<p>
On the US's 5,500 mile northern border with Canada, about eight percent of the
US Border Patrol's 4,000 agents apprehended about 13,000 illegal aliens in
1994, or one percent of the total.  Most were Canadians, but there are reports
that, increasingly, smugglers are attempting to use the "northern route" to
smuggle e.g., Chinese into the US.<p>
The INS unexpectedly extended the March 20, 1995 deadline for replacing "green
cards" issued before 1979 for another year.<p>

Economic
Prospects</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></h2>
On February 21, 1995, the US and Mexico reached agreement on a $52 billion
multilateral rescue package.  On March 30, several Senate Republicans
temporarily stalled a vote on that would have permitted the US to send the
second $5 billion of the $20 billion in loans that the US promised to Mexico.
<p>
On March 9, Mexico announced new austerity measures that went into effect on
April 1, 1995.  The peso climbed against the dollar, ending April at 5.9 pesos
to $1, and the Mexican stock market rose 65 percent since early March.<p>
If the exchange rate averages 6 pesos to $1 in 1995, there would have been a 42
percent devaluation.<p>
The Mexican economic crisis resulted from the country's reliance on short-term
foreign debt to finance far more imports than exports.  When investors thought
that they would be repaid in devalued pesos, they dumped peso-bonds, causing
the devaluation as Mexico ran out of money to support the peso in December.  <p>
Each time that the international rescue package appears to run into trouble,
the peso dives:  in the two weeks between the announcement of the international
rescue package and the announcement of Mexico's new economic plan, the peso
reached new lows--at one point falling to 7.7 pesos to $1.00 on March 9.  The
peso ended March at 6.8 to $1.00.  One dollar bought 3.45 pesos until December
20, 1994.<p>
Mexican-US relationships are asymmetric.  The US imports goods from many
countries and exports goods around the world, but three-fourths of Mexico's
exports and imports are to and from the US.  However, the Mexican economy is
small in comparison to the US economy--equivalent in economic output to Los
Angeles county.  <p>
Among US states, Texas is most dependent on Mexico--about three percent of its
economy is dependent on trade with Mexico, versus less than one percent in
California.  On April 24, the Mexican group El Barzon (Plowshares) blocked
bridges between Texas and Mexico for several days to protest Mexico's austerity
policies.  El Barzon, which claims 700,000 members, all of whom are debtors,
wants a four-year moratorium on the repayment of bank debt.<p>
The peso devaluation has weakened all three NAFTA currencies, leading to
expectations that Canadian, Mexican, and US exports to the rest of the world
will rise in 1995.<p>
For the first time, the new Mexican economic policy has not been endorsed by
business and labor, ending the era of tripartite pacts to divide the pain of
economic policy changes.  The government estimated that the economy would
shrink by two percent in 1995, and that inflation would top 42 percent. <p>
Mexico's minimum wage rose 12 percent on April 1 to 18.30 pesos per day
($2.70).  For the first time, Mexico will publish money supply and other
financial data, so that outsiders can better predict the likely future course
of the economy.<p>
According to a mid-February poll, 81 percent of Mexicans believe that Mexico
paid too high a price for the US rescue of the peso.  Over 60 percent reported
that the peso devaluation had a negative impacts on their standard of
living--savers have lost about half of the dollar value of their savings--and
80 percent thought the Mexican economy was in bad shape.  Crimes such as
robbery have reportedly risen sharply.  <p>
Many Mexicans believe that the conditions attached to the US loan infringe on
Mexican sovereignty.  Under the terms of US assistance to Mexico, the $7 to $8
billion that Mexico earns from oil exports annually must pass through the
Federal Reserve Bank of New York; Mexico will get these oil export earnings
only if it is repaying the US loan.<p>
A major beneficiary of the peso devaluation have been the foreigners who own
maquiladoras, the 2,300 assembly operations employing 650,000 workers and
generating about $7 billion in foreign sales that are strung out along the
US-Mexican border.  These factories import practically all of their inputs, add
value by e.g., assembling TVs, and then export the finished products, usually
to the US.  The peso devaluation reduced maquiladora labor costs about 40
percent in dollar terms (the 50 percent devaluation was followed by a 10 to 15
percent wage increase).<p>
Maquiladora workers, mostly young women, have protested the reduced value of
their wages--13,000 maquiladora workers went on strike in Juarez in the first
three months of 1995.  Some maquiladoras have offered subsidies to their
workers to compensate for the peso's decline.  Mattel, which employs 2,000
workers in a Tijuana toy factory, has begun to offer free breakfasts for
workers whose wages are in pesos, but whose expenditures are dollar-linked in
this border city.<p>
Average maquiladora wages and benefits that were worth about $2.40 per hour in
December are now worth the equivalent of $1.40 per hour.  The government
allowed wages to rise 12 percent on April 1, 1995, but some maquiladora
employers reportedly fear that, if they do not grant bonuses and wage
increases, Mexican workers will be tempted to migrate illegally to the US.
There are about 725 plants with 100,000 workers in California south of San
Diego.<p>
Mexican government actions have also, in the opinion of some, reminded
foreigners of the "old Mexico," in which rules change suddenly.  On March 31,
the Mexican government imposed a 1.8 percent tax on the value of maquiladora
real estate and machinery, increasing the tax bills of many maquiladoras by
five times.<p>
In Washington, the US Secretary of Labor sent a letter to his Mexican
counterpart requesting talks on Sony violating Mexican workers' right to
organize at a plant in Nuevo Laredo, Mexico.  The first two labor complaints
were dismissed.<p>
In March, Zedillo announced a program that will create 550,000 jobs in rural
communities.  Earlier, the agriculture minister announced a farm aid package to
freeze fertilizer prices, continue subsidies and price guarantees for basic
grains, and expand credit. <p>
Farmers of small plots have been among those hardest hit during the recession.
Experts predict that 1 million Mexicans--farmers and their families--will leave
the land over the next 10 years.  With bank loans for farm equipment and
chemicals inaccessible because of 100 percent interest rates, some farmers are
reportedly allowing land to lie fallow. <p>
The major purpose of the US-led bailout of Mexico was to restore foreigners
confidence in the economy, and thereby maintain the inflow of foreign
investment and persuade foreigners who own Mexican bonds to reinvest in Mexico
as their bonds mature.  However, continued economic and political uncertainty
led many foreign investors to turn the pesos they received from maturing bonds
into dollars; most are reportedly refusing to reinvest despite the loan
guarantees.  Many US economists predicted that Mexico would run a trade surplus
in 1995, but mostly because it imports fewer American goods, not because it has
become an export machine.<p>
Mexican export sales increased 16 percent in 1994, and the government hopes
that they will jump 27 percent in 1995.  In February 1995, Mexico recorded an
almost $500 million trade surplus, the largest trade surplus since April 1988.
The US trade deficit widened to a record $12 billion in January 1995, largely
because of the sharp drop in exports to Mexico and Latin America.<p>
The lower peso especially helps the industrial giants based in Monterrey, whose
costs are in pesos, but whose export revenues are in dollars.  Companies such
as CEMEX and Vitro represent about one-seventh of the Mexican economy.  Some
foreign-owned firms are accepting short-term losses on their Mexican production
in the hope that the economy will soon rebound.<p>
Smaller firms that have not established export markets may find it difficult to
break into the export market quickly.  Lulled by affluence at home and
discouraged by an overvalued peso, many did not seek export markets in the
early 1990s.  Those that did are now stuck with very high interest rates to pay
for imported machinery.<p>
The Mexican government projects that it will receive $8 billion in foreign
direct investments in 1995, which would indicate a quick restoration of
confidence in the Mexican economy.  The Mexican stock market reportedly
received a net $630 million in February, 1995, versus a net outflow of $3.3
billion in January.<p>
According to many US experts, the peso devaluation has undone the value of
NAFTA to Mexico.  The rush of foreign investment to Mexico--equivalent to eight
percent of Mexican GDP in 1993--permitted Mexico's real exchange rate to rise
sharply relative to the US dollar--the real exchange rate is the peso/dollar
rate adjusted for the difference in inflation rates.  <p>
Many in the US Congress continue to oppose US assistance for Mexico.  In both
the Senate and the House, there were moves in early April to stop sending
Mexico some of the US loan money promised unless the US government supplies
detailed information on its discussions with Mexico.  The Administration failed
to meet a March 15 deadline to supply requested information to the House.<p>
UCSD's Wayne Cornelius notes that the ruling PRI kept most of the party's
resources in Mexico City, so that it is relatively weak in the states and
cities where opposition parties are strongest.  When threatened at the local
level, the PRI traditionally pumps huge sums of money into local elections--an
estimated $80 per vote in 1992 in Michoacan--and resorts to fraud to stay in
power.<p>

Crunch</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
The INS has been criticized for focusing on illegal immigration rather than
preparing for a wave of naturalization applications.  <p>
About half of all naturalization applications are currently being filed in Los
Angeles and San Francisco--over 1,500 each day in February.  After petitioning
for naturalization, an applicant must typically wait one year for an in-person
interview with the INS.  <p>
Over the next three years, the INS expects more than 2.5 million people to
petition to become US citizens. The INS would like to farm out some functions,
such as certification of English, civic and history proficiency, then spend a
few minutes per applicant for the official interview. <p>
INS Commissioner Doris Meissner requested $30 million from Congress to keep up
with naturalization applications; the INS received $500,000.<p>
There were 555,407 applications for naturalization in FY94, an estimated
760,000 in FY95, and perhaps 800,000 in FY96.  Applications for naturalization
were pouring into INS offices at the rate of over 50,000 per month early in
1995.  There are an estimated 10 million immigrants eligible for US
citizenship.<p>
The number of applications for green cards is also increasing, in part because
of an October 1994 change in the treatment of intending immigrants who are
already in the US.  <p>
Under the old law, aliens had to return to their country of origin to be
interviewed to determine whether they should be allowed to immigrate to the US.
Today, they can remain in the US to be interviewed by paying a $600 fine, which
is cheaper than a return trip for many aliens.  Over 15,000 aliens monthly
applied for green cards under the new rules in FY95.<p>

the Hispanic unemployment rate 1.5 times the white rate.  However, in January
1995, the Hispanic unemployment rate equaled the Black rate of 10.2 percent for

US labor force of 132 million.  Some Hispanic leaders argue that the jump in
the Hispanic unemployment rate reflects increased discrimination against
Hispanics unleashed by IRCA in 1986 and Prop. 187 in 1994.  Others point to the
very low educational levels of many recent Hispanic immigrants, and to the
severe recession in California --one-third of US Hispanics live in California,
which has a higher than average unemployment rate of 6.7 percent.<p>
On April 5, the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration and Claims heard
that immigration hurts US minorities, but there was little agreement among
those who testified on how much.  Three witnesses argued that the depressing
impact of immigrants on US workers was substantial, especially in areas such as
Los Angeles where immigrants concentrate--the population of Los Angeles is 38
percent foreign-born.  <p>
Vernon Briggs of Cornell University emphasized that especially unauthorized
immigrants are willing to work "hard and scared," so that Americans cannot
compete with them.  Frank L. Morris, a professor at Morgan State University,
argued that Blacks suffer disproportionately the effects of illegal immigration
because they lag behind the rest of the population in education and skills.
Norman Matloff of the University of California at Davis argued that new
immigrants compete with earlier arrivals.<p>
Joseph G. Altonji of Northwestern University argued that between 1980 and 1990,
when immigration added six to eight percent to the US population, the wages of
less skilled natives fell by about two percent.<p>
Lindsay Lowell of the US Department of Labor testified that, in the early
1980s, there were very small effects of illegal immigrants on US wages and
employment.  This conclusion was based on estimates of the number of illegal
aliens in most major US cities in 1980.  According to most estimates, 10
percent more illegal immigrants in a city's labor market reduced the average
earnings of Black and Mexican-American workers by two to five percent--meaning
that adding 10,000 more illegal workers in a city with 100,000 such workers
might reduce hourly earnings by $0.25, or from $5 to $4.75.</a></a><p>
The April issue of Reason magazine includes an article in praise of illegal
immigrants that asserts that that nearly a third of all the nation's full-time
farm workers are unauthorized--full-time is not defined, and one-third is
probably high, since most unauthorized workers are employed seasonally, usually
defined as three to nine months.<p>
According to the Reason article, higher wages in the US and free trade might
result in some labor-intensive commodities being mechanized or imported.  This
normally free trade magazine considers such an event undesirable.
<a name="_Toc319114195"><a name="_Toc319126462"><p>
It is often argued that, without immigrants, a particular industry or regional
economy would grind to a halt.  While it is true that it is very hard to
predict exactly how particular industries and economies would adjust to fewer
workers and higher wages, economics is built on the notion that changing prices
eliminate shortages, including labor shortages.<p>
In the late 1980s, American hospitals increased the share of nurses who were
RNs, hiring in some years 30,000 RNs per year.  Today, of the 1.5 million
nursing staff in the US hospitals, about one million are registered nurses, and
200,000 are LPNs.</a></a>  
<a name="_Toc319114196"><a name="_Toc319126463"><p>
However, in response to cost cutting in the health care industry, the number of
aides has increased sharply.  Hospitals stopped using RNs for tasks such as
bathing patients and taking temperatures.</a></a>

The Oklahoma City bombing led to a spate of counterterrorist immigration
proposals.  Although initial reports that Middle Eastern terrorists were
responsible proved to be wrong, lawmakers still want to toughen up existing
legislation. <p>
The proposals under consideration include: establishing special courts to speed
up the deportation of suspected terrorists, denying entry to anyone affiliated
with a terrorist group, and giving the FBI and other federal investigators
wider surveillance and wiretapping powers.  Many of these provisions were
drafted after the World Trade Center bombing, but Congress and the Clinton
administration have been slow to act on them. <p>
Current law does not deny entry to members of foreign terrorist organizations,
unless they have committed a terrorist act.  Suspected terrorists sometimes
enter the US and request political asylum, which allows them to remain in the
US while their request is being considered. <p>

<a name="RTFToC7">Welfare
Reform, SSI, and the American
Poor</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
The House appropriated $1 billion more for the INS in 1996, as requested by
Clinton, but said that the additional funds should deter at least 300,000
illegal entries, suggesting that the House Appropriations subcommittee was
willing to pay $3,300 per deterred alien.<p>
The House also approved a welfare reform bill that would ban most legal
immigrants who are not-US citizens and younger than 75 from many means-tested
programs.  One goal of the ban is to reduce the cost of Supplemental Security
Income or SSI, a federal program that provides $2 billion annually to about
440,000 legal immigrants, or one-fourth of the elderly immigrants in the US.
About 10 percent of elderly US citizens receive SSI.<p>
SSI provides in most states almost $300 per month for persons 65 and older who
have incomes of less than $450 and liquid assets of less than about $2,000.
The argument for making elderly immigrants ineligible for SSI arises from the
fact that many elderly immigrants receiving SSI live with often-affluent
children who sponsored their entry by promising that, if their parents were
permitted to immigrate, they would not become a public charge.  However, 1990
COP data suggest that 20 percent of the elderly immigrants receiving SSI live
in households with incomes of $50,000 or more, higher than the $37,000 median
household income for US families with the same five persons in 1989.  <p>
Until 1994, elderly immigrants could apply for SSI three years after their
arrival; in that year, the wait was lengthened to five years.  Most of the
elderly Mexican immigrants collecting SSI are Mexicans, two-thirds of the
Laotians 65 and older collect SSI.  Resentment has been fueled by the fact
that, e.g., almost half of the elderly Korean immigrants collect SSI, even
though Koreans are among the highest-income groups in the US.<p>
In the Senate, there were indications that the House-approved ban on most legal
aliens obtaining most forms of public assistance such as Food Stamps, AFDC, and
Medicaid would be dropped.  Legal aliens who work in the US pay taxes just as
US citizens do, and there were objections raised to rewarding those who choose
to become US citizens with access to welfare.  Abuses, some argue, could be
cleared up by requiring US residents who sponsor their relatives to reimburse
the government if, after arrival, the aliens need assistance.  The exclusion of
legal aliens from welfare saves about $4 billion per year.<p>
Welfare reform will, in any event, give the states greater flexibility to
decide who is eligible for benefits.  The Congressional fight is over groups
that will be denied benefits even if states were willing to make them eligible.
For example, the welfare reform approved by the House would prohibit states
from paying benefits to mothers under 18 who seek benefits for their children,
and require states to end cash assistance after five years.<p>
New restrictions on welfare should enlarge the pool of US workers available for
unskilled jobs.  Some studies show that there is intense competition for
low-wage jobs, even if they are part-time, and offer lower real wages than in
1979--the real wages of male high school dropouts have declined 23 percent
since 1979 to $21,600, while the real wages of persons with at least four years
of college have increased five percent to $50,300.  <p>
Traditionally, many women get off welfare through marriage, but declining male
wages have made that option more difficult.  A woman working 30 hours weekly or
120 monthly earns about $900 per month, without health benefits, and often
incurs child care costs of at least $200 per month, and $100 for
transportation, leaving $600 for all other expenses. <p>
The IRS estimated that at least 160,000 illegal aliens collected $200 million
in Earned Income Tax Credits (EITC) by filing tax forms that claim the refund
in 1994.  There is no current provision in the Internal Revenue Code that
prohibits illegal aliens from receiving the Earned Income Credit even though
they are ineligible to work in the United States.<p>
In Los Angeles county, where 23 percent of all residents were foreign-born in
1990, an examination of 4,000 AFDC cases in 1993 found that 44 percent of the
recipients were immigrants, including 17 percent who were illegal immigrants.
Refugees got the highest amount--$7,900-- because they had almost four persons
per family on AFDC, while illegal immigrants with US citizen babies got the
least per family--$4,900--but the most per capita.<p>

Farm
Workers</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a><a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></h2>
Farm workers are one of only three US occupations with one million or more
workers in which the majority of workers are immigrants--the other two are
maids and janitors.  There are two to three million farm workers, including
about 800,000 persons who work for wages sometime during each year on
California farms.  About half of these California farm workers might be
considered dependent on farm work for most of their earnings--a typical
California farm worker earns about $5 hourly for about 1,000 hours of work, for
$5,000 in annual farm earnings.<p>
For over 100 years, most California farm workers have been persons who could
not obtain any other jobs in California, usually because they lacked English,
skills, and contacts.  In 1965, Cesar Chavez organized a strike by California
grape harvesters to protest grower refusal to pay mostly local workers the same
wages that they were required to pay to non-immigrant Mexican workers. Since
the Bracero program ended in 1964, Chavez's United Farm Workers was able in
1966 to win a 40 percent wage increase.<p>
In 1975, California became the first major agricultural state to enact a law
that granted farm workers the right to organize into unions, and required
employers to bargain with the union representative elected by workers.  During
the next 20 years, there were about 1,200 elections involving 100,000
workers--the same worker could vote in several elections--but one-third of
these elections were held in the last five months of  1975.<p>
Immigration marked the rise and fall of the UFW.  In 1980, the UFW asked for
another 40 percent increase.  After a bitter strike that saw growers turn to
labor contractors who organized crews of often illegal workers to be strike
breakers, the UFW won an Pyretic victory--many companies that agreed to UFW
demands went out of business.  UFW membership fell from a peak of perhaps
60,000 in the late 1970s to as few as 5,000 in the early 1990s.<p>
The UFW resumed efforts to organize farm workers after Cesar Chavez died in
1993, and in December 1994, the UFW won an election to represent the 1,400
workers employed by Bear Creek, better known as Jackson-Perkins, the rose
company.  On March 17, the UFW negotiated a three- year contract that increases
wages and benefits 22 percent over the life of the contract, sets a $5.82
hourly starting wage, and offers nine paid holidays, including Chavez's March
31 birthday.  The United Farm Workers Union held events around the nation to
honor the anniversary of the death of UFW founder Cesar Chavez.<p>
On the eve of the 20th anniversary of California's Agricultural Labor Relations
Act's, the state's Legislative Analyst proposed eliminating the ALRB as an
independent agency, and combining it with the Public Employment Relations
Board, the agency that regulates labor relations for public employees.  The
ALRB currently has only two of its authorized five members, and in 1993-94 its
50 employees certified the results of nine elections and issued 31 unfair labor
Practice complaints.  The UFW protested the inclusion of the ALRB into the
PERB, arguing that it is currently in negotiations with 32 farms that employ
13,000 farm workers.<p>
In Washington, the welfare reform bill approved by the House of Representatives
in March 1995 included a provision that permits H-2A temporary alien farm
workers for the first time to receive AFDC, SSI, Medicaid, Food Stamps, housing
assistance, and most of the other federal means-tested benefits that would be
eliminated for legal immigrants under welfare reform.  <p>
There was much speculation as to who inserted this provision, and why.  Most
guesses were that south Florida orange growers who have planted thousands of
acres of oranges in places where there is population or housing inserted the
provision so that, if they need H-2A orange harvesters in the future, they can
use the welfare system to subsidize the cost of housing and feeding them.<p>
After Rep Berman(D-CA) alerted his colleagues to the provision, Rep. Archer
(R-TX) defended the eligibility of H-2A workers for welfare by asserting that
temporary farm workers need better treatment (Congressional Record of March
23,1995, H3594). <p>

On April 15, a federal judge in Oakland refused California Governor Wilson's
request to have arguments over the constitutionality of Prop 187 determined
first by state courts.  The ruling means that a trial will be held on the
constitutionality of Prop 187 in federal court in Los Angeles.  The Wilson
Administration has drafted regulations to implement 187, but it is not clear
whether they will be used during the trial to illustrate how the state
government interprets Prop 187.<p>
California Rep Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) introduced a bill in the House in

immigrants.<p>
In Los Angeles county, where the number of people on welfare--924,000 or 10
percent of the population--doubled between February 1989 and mid-1994, welfare
rolls have been shrinking since summer 1994--1.84 million county residents were
receiving benefits from at least one of eight means-tested programs in February
1995, from AFDC to Medi-Cal to general relief.<p>
In a sign of the times, California in 1995 will spend more to house 126,000
prisoners than it spends to educate students in the UC and CSU systems.
Corrections takes 10 percent of the state's $40 billion budget, while higher
education gets about 9.5 percent.  If the three strikes law is fully
implemented, and corrections and higher education continue to share 20 percent
of the state's budget, then corrections would take 18 and higher education two
percent of the state's budget in 2002.<p>
Florida expects that the number of criminal aliens deported will quadruple from
468 in FY 1994 to about 2,200 in FY 96.  The INS has promised to hire more
immigration judges, investigators and lawyers to speed up the process.<p>
An article in the April 20 New England Journal of Medicine warns that Prop. 187
could endanger public health, deny care to people in need and undermine
professional ethics.  Another article warns that there could be a spread of
contagious diseases like tuberculosis among untreated illegal immigrants.  <p>
A separate Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study reports that 30
percent of the TB cases reported in the US in 1993 occurred in foreign-born
persons, an increase from 22 percent in 1986.  Most of those with TB were
immigrants were from Latin American and Southeast Asia. <p>

</a></h2>
Some speculate that early intervention in emigration nations could prevent
crises that later produce illegal immigration.  Between the September 19, 1994
entry of troops into Haiti and March 1995, the US government spent about $700
million on Operation Uphold Democracy, or $140 million per month, or almost $5
million per day.  <p>
Before the intervention, the US was spending $300 million per year, or about $1
million per day, on Coast Guard patrols, safe haven camps, and asylum
procedures for Haitians.  The Clinton Administration considers the Haiti
operation "an investment that protects our borders," according to Deputy
Secretary of State Strobe Talbot before the House International Relations
Committee on February 24, 1995.<p>
In early April, 1995, the US Coast Guard picked up 240 Haitians in boats, the
first boat people since Aristide's return in October, 1994.  Aristide did not
renew the immigration agreement between the US and Haiti, so there is some
question as to what will happen to Haitians picked up at sea. <p>
Haiti is finalizing plans to repatriate boat people.  The Turks and Caicos
Islands, British possessions, will wait until November, 1995 to repatriate
Haitians, while the Haitian government tries to prepare for their return. <p>
Cuba and the US ended two days of talks on immigration issues on April 19. The
talks were the third round of negotiations since an agreement between the two
countries in September which halted the exodus of 35,000 boat people.  The
agreement calls for "safe, legal and orderly" migration between the two
countries.  <p>
In 1994, some 32,000 Cubans left the island nation.  There are still 22,000
Cubans in Guantanamo and, after humanitarian cases are admitted to the US,
there will still be 15,000 Cubans there.  An estimated 1,000 Cubans returned
illegally from Guantanamo to Cuba.<p>
During the talks, Cuba argued that the 32-year US trade embargo stimulates
emigration.  Cuba hopes to head off an effort by Senator Jesse Helms that would
tighten the embargo.<p>
Of the more than 6,000 Cubans allowed to come to the United States from
Guantanamo, about five percent are college graduates. <p>
A poll released on April 16 of Cuban exiles in Miami and Union City, New Jersey
conducted by Florida International University, shows that 83 percent think that
the Cuban refugees at Guantanamo should be allowed to come to the US.  Only 34
percent agreed that the Cuban refugees should have been sent to Guantanamo in
the first place. <p>

<a name="RTFToC11">Immigration
History</a></a></a></a></a></a> 
</a></h2>
Immigration is a major public policy issue at the end of the 20th century, as
it was at the beginning.  What do the lessons of history teach about the
current debate over immigration?  <p>
About one million immigrants arrived annually at the beginning of the 20th
century, and about one million are arriving annually today.  It is widely
believed that the immigrants arriving in the early 1900s came to settle, and
made their way in the US without welfare assistance, while some of the
immigrants arriving today allegedly come to get public assistance.<p>
The population in 1900 was smaller, so the number of arrivals per 100
residents--the rate of immigration--was larger.  But Americans and immigrants
had large families then, so the immigrant contribution to population growth
then was lower than it is today--immigrants accounted for about 20 percent of
population growth in the early 1900's and 30 percent today.<p>
In the early 1900s, most Americans were farmers and rural residents, while most
immigrants moved to cities.  This means that immigrants were a large fraction
of the clients in public hospitals and similar institutions--since such
institutions existed mostly in cities.   <p>
Nathan Glazer notes that the expansion of the welfare state--in a time of low
immigration, and when there was no expectation that the US would ever again
become a nation of mass immigration--left the US vulnerable to e.g., elderly
immigrants who never worked in the US depending on an SSI system designed for
elderly Americans who did not accumulate sufficient credits for social security
and pensions.<p>
Glazer argues that the US today is both more tolerant of minorities and less
optimistic about its future.  Instead of Americanization, he notes, there is
bilingual education; and the combination of falling real wages and worries of
over population and environmental degradation make it harder to assume there
will be unidimensional progress with or without immigration.<p>
The US is likely to restrict and reform its immigration policies in the 1990s.
Glazer argues that it should begin by making immigrants ineligible for
affirmative action and similar preference policies, and Frederick Rose argues
that immigration in this century has gone through a hump shape in terms of
perceptions of immigrant success.  <p>
Early 1900s immigrants were perceived to include many persons dependent on the
meager public assistance programs then available.  The immigrants arriving
after numerical restrictions were imposed in 1921 led to a high proportion of
very skilled and talented immigrants, a trend that was maintained by the 1965
lifting of the ban on Asian immigrants.<p>
However, the rising number of especially Hispanic immigrants in the 1980s has
led to a reassessment and a perception that, once again, immigrants include
many people who are in need of public assistance.  Although most researchers
note that, in an economy with 132 million workers, of whom no more than 10
million are unskilled legal and illegal immigrants, the nation's economic fate
is not tied to immigration, a reassessment of immigrant progress by George
Borjas that argues that Mexican immigrants who lagged Northern Europeans in
education and income a century ago continue to have slower upward mobility.<p>

<a name="RTFToC13">Anti-immigrant
Platform Helps French Right</a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
Jean-Marie Le Pen, the leader of the National Front, received about 4.6 million
votes in the first round of French Presidential elections on April 23.  This
represented 15 percent of all votes cast, and 27 percent of the votes cast by
working class voters and the unemployed. <p>
Jacques Chirac, the conservative candidate in the May 7 run-off election,
appealed for votes from Le Pen supporters by asserting that "France must firmly
oppose illegal immigration," and that changes are needed to avoid ethnic and
religious ghettos.<p>
France has a 12.3 percent unemployment rate, and a mixture of economic
uncertainty and fears of immigrants reportedly gave Le Pen the
higher-than-expected vote.<p>
Racial intolerance is reportedly rising in Southern France, where the gap
between French and North African immigrants is widening.  Le Pen is especially
popular in Marseilles, where he won 28 percent of the vote.  North Africans in
Marseilles with French citizenship registered to vote in record numbers.<p>
On February 21, 1995, supporters of the National Front, while posting campaign
signs, killed in unclear circumstances a 17-year old son of an African
immigrant in Marseilles. (March, 1995 Migration News) Le Pen did not punish the
Front members, claiming the killing was an accident, until 15,000 people
protested the weekend after the shooting.  <p>
Le Pen then expelled the three supporters from the party.  They are now
awaiting trial.  Le Pen now claims now that the killing was a conspiracy to
discredit his party.  Marseilles city officials banned the National Front
rallies, fearing violence. <p>
France continues to worry about another wave of Algerian migration.  An
institute in Paris released a report that asserts that political instability,
not demography, will be the major factor contributing to emigration from North
African nations.  Population growth rates have been falling--between 1975 and
1980, annual growth rates in Algeria and Morocco were 3.1 percent and 2.4
percent.  Today, they are estimated to be 2.2 percent and 2 percent.<p>
Almost 80 percent of those polled in a recent survey agreed that "Muslim
fundamentalism is a very serious threat in our country which must be fought."
There are about five million Muslims in France.<p>
In a new report based on interviews with 13,000 people, the National Institute
for Demographic Studies (INED) concluded that immigrants are assimilating in
classic ways--90 percent of Algerian youth consider French to be their native
tongue, children in working-class families are doing better than their parents,
as well as similar French youth, and mixed marriages between French and North
Africans are on the rise.  Almost half of the Algerian immigrants reported that
they did not actively practice Islam. <p>
The French population, now 56 million, is projected to rise to 62 million by
2015, or about 333,000 per year, assuming that fertility remains at 1.8
children per woman.  Most of the growth would be in the Paris region and in
southern France.<b>  </b><p>

<a name="RTFToC14">Germany
Returns Vietnamese, Discusses Legalization</a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
Germany agreed to provide DM 100 million annually to repatriate 40,000 illegal
and rejected Vietnamese asylum seekers--including 10,000 former guest workers
in East Germany, 20,000 rejected Vietnamese asylum seekers, and 10,000 illegal
entrants; at least DM25 million are to be spent supporting repatriated
Vietnamese.  Germany plans to return all of the Vietnamese by the year 2000.<p>
Vietnam in mid-April protested searches of Vietnamese apartments by German
police.  German police targeted Vietnamese hostels in Berlin following gang
warfare between competing cigarette-trafficking rings, which left five people
dead.  At the end of 1994, there were about 100,000 Vietnamese in Germany.<p>
There were 10, 991 asylum applications in March 1995, and 32,995 in the first
three months of 1995, a 10 percent drop over the first three months of 1994.
The German Bundesrat, dominated by the SPD, has proposed a legalization for
asylum applicants who have been in Germany eight or more years.<p>
German President Herzog visited Kazakhstan in early April to discuss the future
of perhaps 500,000 ethnic Germans who have the right to return to Germany as
citizens under an annual quota of 225,000 per year.  Stalin deported hundreds
of thousands of Germans to Kazakhstan in 1941, and a 1991 census put their
number at some 900,000 out of a Kazakh population of 17 million.<p>
In 1994, 122,000 Germans in Kazakhstan returned to Germany, up from 115,000 in
1993 and 113,000 in 1991.<p>
Germany officially bans dual citizenship, but an estimated two million of
Germany's 81 million population have two passports.  Most are ethnic Germans,
who are allowed to keep their Russian or Kazakh passports and acquire German
passports upon their arrival in Germany.<p>
Germany has begun recruiting more foreign-born police officers so that they can
help ease the tensions between minority communities and the police.
Non-Germans also have a better change to infiltrate foreign criminal bands
operating in Germany.  Of Germany's 227,000 police officers, 100 are not
German-born. <p>
Two stumbling blocks to recruiting more foreign-born police are language
barriers and the requirement that police officers must be German citizens.<p>
In a recent survey of job seekers, 36 percent of the west Germans, and 12
percent of those in the east, reported that they could conduct business in a
foreign language, usually English.  Over 95 percent of the students in West
Germany studying a foreign language are learning English.<p>
Germany's unemployment rate dropped slightly to 9.6 percent in March, meaning
that there were about 3.7 million unemployed and 35 million employed workers in
Germany.  Germany's GDP is projected to grow by three percent in 1995, or 2.5
percent in the west, and 8.5 percent in the east.<p>
On April 5, 1995, Germany and Poland signed an accord to deal with illegal
immigration.  All police radio communications, telephone, and fax links are to
be standardized on both sides of the border; the cost will be covered from the
DM120 million marks ($US 87 million) in aid already pledged by Bonn to Warsaw
for crime-fighting measures.<p>
Recent German research indicates that 12 million non-German workers - prisoners
of war, concentration camp inmates, and civilians in German-occupied areas -
were required to work in German factories and other workplaces, so that, by the
end of the war, non-Germans were 40 percent of the German manufacturing work
force.  Only the Italians, until the collapse of the German-Italian axis in
1943, were legally on an equal footing with German workers.  Typical work days
were 10 to 11 hours, and 60 hour work weeks.<p>
Some of the forced laborers have gone to court to demand compensation.  A 1952
agreement between Germany and Israel paid $1 billion to "slave laborers."
Non-Jewish "civilian" forced laborers who were not war prisoners have not
received compensation.  The 1952 agreement does not allow claims to be made
directly against German companies; they must be made by countries against
Germany.<p>

<a name="RTFToC15">Britain-No
More Welfare For
Asylees</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
Home Secretary Michael Howard wants to cut welfare payments to 50,000
immigrants who have whose applications for political asylum were initially
rejected.  Currently, claims take about seven months to be heard.  The new
rules mean that once applicants have been refused political asylum, they will
no longer receive benefits while they appeal their rejection. <p>
Howard also plans to introduce stiff fines on employers who hire illegal
immigrants.  Prime Minster Major has endorsed the call for all legal residents
of Britain to be required to carry an ID card.<p>
In January and February of 1995, over 6,500 immigrants who were caught entering
the country illegally, or overstaying their tourist visas, claimed political
asylum.  In 1994, over 42,000 asylum seekers were paid welfare benefits which
range from L41per week for a single man over 25 to L114 for a couple with two
teenage children.  Many also claimed housing benefits of up to L100 per week
per family.  According to the Scottish Refugee Service, asylum seekers need the
welfare benefits because the government does not permit them to work for their
first six months in the UK. <p>
The 1993 Asylum and Immigration Appeals Act brought a spectacular jump in the
proportion of asylum claims refused, from 14 per cent in the six months before
it came into force to 76 per cent in the first nine months of 1994.  There were
53,000 applicants awaiting a decision in September 1994.<p>
The Scottish Refugee Council claims that the Home Office has inflated the
number of asylum seekers to justify more restricted border controls.  The Home
Office based its proposed legislation on the assumption that 90 percent of the
asylum seekers are in fact economic migrants, which the Scottish Refugee
Council says is not true. <p>
The Home Office reports that many North Africans enter the country through a
network of underground smugglers, then claim millions of dollars in benefits.
The problem, they assert, is especially common among Algerians, who purchase
forged documents for as little as L40.  Between January and April, 1995, more
than 500 Algerians claimed asylum in Britain, compared with 305 in all of
1993.<p>
It was estimated that at least 5,000 illegal immigrants used false documents to
enter Britain in 1994.  A London raid on a visa factory found that
counterfeiters were making false British passports by using names and addresses
from phone books and selling them to foreigners for $800 each.  Police also
uncovered advice for Kurds that advised them to apply for asylum if
apprehended, since the process of considering their application would give them
at least 32 weeks in the UK.<p>
According to the European Commission, Britons are the leading emigrants in the
EU, surpassing even the flow of refugees from the former Yugoslavia.  In 1992,
there were nearly 150,000 British emigrants.  <p>
The most common destinations were the US, Australia and other EU states,
primarily Ireland and Germany.  These data exclude most of the estimated
100,000 British workers who work in the German construction industry.<p>

However, Austria's accession to the EU has not yet been approved by all of the

Under the Schengen agreement that went into effect on March 26, 1995, cars can

Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam, which has only one terminal, has emerged as a
place where illegal immigrants can slip into the EU.  Intra-EU passengers
receive smart cards that enable them to bypass passport controls, but many of
the cards are tossed away by arriving passengers who go through immigration
inspection, so that persons wanting to avoid passport controls can use them.

Germany's tougher controls on its eastern borders have led to long queues at

The Czech Republic is attracting illegal workers following the clampdown by the
European Union countries, according to the president of a Czech labor union.
He estimates that there are about 8,000 illegal foreign manual workers in the
country.  <p>
Foreign workers are willing to work for low wages, about 2,200 Czech crowns per
month, about 5,300 Czech crowns less than Czechs.  According to official data,
the average wage in the construction industry for the first three months of
1995 was 7,652 Czech crowns per month.  In addition, those employing illegal
workers do not pay medical and social insurance.<p>
A total of 32,000 foreigners were legally working in the Czech Republic as of
December 31,1994.  Over 24,000 were manual workers, about half of whom were
employed in the construction industry.<p>
The premier of the Czech Republic predicted that unemployment in the country
would increase by two percentage points over the next two to four years.  He
said that as industrial output increased, the foreign workers were being
absorbed into the economy, but the government should not tighten restrictions
because there are more Czechs working abroad than foreigners working in the
republic. <p>
Almost 320,000 Slovaks acquired Czech nationality in 1993 and 1994 following
the 1993 split of Czechoslovakia.  <p>
Over 20,000 people were questioned, detained or arrested in 1994 in connection
with illegally crossing the Czech border, and 3,500 were apprehended in 1994.
In 1994, legal proceedings started against 74 people for smuggling migrants.<p>
Under a 1994 Czech-German migration agreement, Germany is to provide DM60
million to the Czech Republic to pay for border security, administering
regulations concerning foreigners, and building asylum infrastructure.  The
Czech Republic granted refugee status to 1,300 aliens since 1991, but in 1994,
one-third of those in Czech refugee camps disappeared, presumably to try to
enter Germany or Austria.<p>
Czech farmers have complained that there are not enough farm workers, and that
"thousands" of guest workers will have to be imported to tend livestock.  Farm
work is "hard and poorly paid" according to farm spokespersons.<p>

<a name="RTFToC19">Philippines
to Protect Migrants</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
After Singapore hanged a maid convicted of murdering a child and another maid
on March 17, the Philippine government came under strong domestic pressure to
do more for Filipino migrant workers.  The Philippine government reprimanded
several of its diplomats in Singapore for not doing enough to help the maid and
downgraded relations with Singapore.  Foreign Secretary Roberto Romula
announced his resignation on April 17, taking blame for "shortcomings" in
handling the case. <p>
The Philippines president called a special session of the country's new
Congress, which will be elected in May, to ratify a Charter for Overseas
Contract Workers.  The government will also review its policies on the
deployment of workers abroad and will conduct on-site investigations of the
working conditions abroad. <p>
The commission appointed after the hanging called upon the president to: 1)
certify for ratification by the Senate the International Convention on the
Protection of the Rights of all Migrant Workers and members of their families;
2) consider having Philippine government representatives help to regularize the
status of undocumented workers overseas --an estimated 1.8 million, or 42
percent of all overseas workers; 3) conduct an immediate study and consider a
selective ban on domestic helpers and those belonging to the so-called
vulnerable trade from going abroad; and 4) conduct a serious crackdown on
illegal recruitment, and illegal exaction of fees by licensed and unlicensed
recruitment agencies.<p>
The Philippines sent several observers to the trial of a 15-year old Filipina
maid in the United Arab Emirates who has been accused of murder, which she
alleges was self-defense after a rape. A Sri Lankan maid in the UAE was
executed by firing squad on April 13 for the murder of her employer's four-year
old daughter.<p>
The Philippines requires migrant workers to be at least 25, and the United Arab
Emirates requires them to be at least 18.  The 15-year old Filipina used false
documents to get the UAE job.  About 75 percent of the UAE's two million

workers need to have their rights protected-- Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United

There are currently about between 35,000 and 80,000 legal foreign workers, and
another 50,000 illegal workers in South Korea.  About 23,000 work as industrial
trainees with official contracts in small-and medium-sized firms. <p>
The government has announced plans to increase their number by 12,000 to 18,000
to cope with labor shortages caused by projected growth rates of seven percent
annually, and an unemployment rate of less than two percent.  Young Koreans
reportedly prefer white collar jobs, even though some manual jobs that are
filled by foreigners pay better.  <p>
South Korea has developed a reputation as being a difficult place for foreign
workers, due to harsh winters, difficult work, and the Korean language.
According to a recent study, foreign laborers work on average 11 hours a day
and earn $720 a month, including allowances and other benefits, up from $480 in
1994.  The 30,000 "technical trainees" legally in the country earn about $400 a

<a name="RTFToC21">Chinese
Fear Weak Economy Will Lead to Migration</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
Growing inequality within China is causing worries that more of China's 450
million peasants, and 900 million urban residents, might migrate to the booming
coastal cities or abroad.  China has 500 officially recognized cities,
including 200 that appeared since the mid-1980s.  Real incomes are rising
throughout the country, but much faster in urban areas, so that urban wages and
incomes are often four to six times greater than rural wages and incomes.<p>
Effective May 1, the Chinese government reduced the work week from 44 hours to
40.  This comes a year after the government asked companies to reduce the work
week from 48 hours to 44.  Government officials hope that the adjustment will
make more jobs available. <p>
Under new rules to take effect in Beijing on July 15, employers will not be
able to hire migrant labor without a special permit from a designated job
introduction organization.  There are now over three million migrant workers in
Beijing.  Migrants must obtain temporary residence permits to find work and
housing under the new rules. <p>
In China's southern province of Guangdong, officials report that a program to
control migrant workers by licensing has been successful.  They expect to cover
about half of Guangdong's 10 million transient workers by the end of 1995.  The
province has also set up a labor information network.  <p>
Chinese officials estimate that, of the 220,000 Chinese students who have gone
abroad since 1979, only 75,000 have returned.  The Chinese government believes
that part of the blame for this 'brain drain' falls on Western nations such as
Canada and the United States whose immigration policies give easy entry to the
well-educated.<p>
To counteract the 'brain drain,' several universities, such as Beijing
University, are offering higher pay, better housing, and improved working
conditions for students who return home.  The government has also established a
fund to support the research of returnees.  <p>
The State Education Commission in April began a proactive program which
requires students to return in a timely manner as a precondition for government
funding of overseas education.  But this impacts few students.  Of the 220,000
who have left China, only 40,000 were state-funded. <p>
There are also reports of an internal 'brain drain,' in which talented students
are migrating from China's poor inland areas to the rich coastal regions.  An
estimated 35,000 skilled technicians have left China's inland western provinces
over the past three years.  Incentives similar to those offered to overseas
students have been given to students from the inland provinces who return.  <p>
Authorities in Guangzhou are trying to close illegal quarries which have been
compared to concentration camps.  In some quarries, 50 to 60 workers sleep in a
room of about 160 square feet.  Workers are sometimes held as virtual slaves.
At one mine, rescuers freed workers several times over the past year.  Workers
are physically abused and often not paid. <p>

Over 30,000 overseas domestic workers are expected to vote in September's
election in Hong Kong.  The vote is expected to raise the issues of violence
against domestic workers.  Hong Kong officials said domestic helpers qualify to
vote as long as they acquired permanent residency under the Electoral Provision
Ordinance, which requires them to have been in Hong Kong for seven years or
more. <p>
The government of Hong Kong is investigating the consulate of the Dominican
Republic in Hong Kong, which has been accused of selling passports to Chinese
headed to the US.  Investigators believe hundreds of mainland Chinese have paid
$15,000 for illegally-issued passports and visas.  Dominican authorities say
the illegal immigrants are then transported to Puerto Rico by an international
trafficking ring. <p>
In the fall of 1994, Hong Kong's honorary consul in Antigua was fired after
being tied to the issuance of illegal passports.  In February 1995, an
investigator with the US Immigration and Naturalization Service in Hong Kong
was jailed for four years for accepting bribes from people applying to emigrate
to the US. <p>
Mainland Chinese mothers are illegally entering Hong Kong to deliver their
children so that they can receive automatic right to abode in 1997 under
Article 24 of the Basic Law.  Immigration figures show that about 10,000 babies
were born to mainland mothers in 1994. <p>

Southeast Asian governments have set an end of 1995 deadline to return all
Vietnamese living in camps inside their countries to Vietnam.  The UNHCR is
cooperating in the return of an expected 3,600 Vietnamese each month from Hong
Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand.  The US declared on
March 17 that Vietnamese whose applications for asylum were rejected have no
choice but to return home.<p>
Malaysia on April 11 announced its plan to return 4,700 Vietnamese.  There are
22,000 Vietnamese in Hong Kong, and most are due to be returned. Vietnam argues
that 400 of the boat people in Hong Kong are not Vietnamese.<p>
Vietnam is accepting most of those being returned, but it is refusing to accept
the return of at least several hundred thousand ethnic Chinese.  China has
agreed to accept the ethnic Chinese rejected by Vietnam.<p>
There are believed to be 50 Vietnamese in Vietnam who were sent by the US into
North Vietnam in the early 1960s to disrupt the economy there, but the INS does
not believe their story, and has refused to accept them as refugees to the US.
Classified papers can be read to suggest that their assertions are true, which
may entitle them to refugee status in the US.<p>

Taiwanese employers have been urged to treat their foreign workers better.
Most of the 210,000 foreign workers currently in the country are from Thailand
and the Philippines.  <p>
At the end of 1994, 112,188 foreign laborers worked in Taiwan's manufacturing
sector, up 22 times from 1992 and accounting for five percent of all
manufacturing workers.  Foreigners were six percent of Taiwan's construction
workers.<p>
Taiwan announced that manufacturers could request another 8,200 foreign workers
beginning in April 1995.  Turnover in electronics and garment factories is
high--20 to 40 percent annually.  Many Taiwanese have moved to China because of
labor shortages in Taiwan.<p>
Taiwan estimates that its labor shortage in construction was 11 percent in
April 1990, but fell to one percent in September 1993.  The labor shortage in
manufacturing was seven percent in June 1989, and four percent in September
1993. <p>

Brunei, all the countries have stationed troops on the islands.  The Spratly

<a name="RTFToC27">Australia
Reduces Immigr</a></a></a></a></a></a>ation</a></a>
</a></h2>
Australia received fewer immigrants in 1993-94--69,800--than planned, and
almost 15 percent fewer than the 81,000 anticipated.  Almost 30 percent of the
immigrants were from Europe, including the ex-USSR, and 20 percent were from
southeast Asia.  Immigration to Australia peaked at 145,000 in 1988-89.<p>
About half of the immigrants were in the family unification category, and 18
percent or 12,800 came because they had needed skills--the skilled category
experienced a sharp decrease.  There were also 11,400 humanitarian
admissions.<p>
Critics alleged that too many non-English speaking immigrants arrive in the
family unification category; according to one, Australia risks creating "a new
ethnically-based non-English speaking underclass of long-term jobless migrants
now living on unemployment benefits."<p>
One reason why the number of skilled immigrants dropped so sharply is that
Australia is facing an oversupply of lawyers, engineers and school teachers.
In 1993-1994, 445 doctors, 324 civil engineers, 537 secondary school teachers,
210 lawyers, 149 economists and 114 architects were among the immigrants to
Australia.  Some critics believe that immigration is creating new job seekers
when there is already an oversupply. <p>
A study by a Monash University sociologist found that Australia's unfocused
acceptance of migrants has led to an increase of professional migrants where
there is already a surplus.  For instance, a large number of doctors have been
admitted to Australia but they are not allowed to practice. Doctors wishing to
enter Australia as skilled migrants have to achieve a set  number of points
according to government criteria and pass an English test.  Others are accepted
if they are sponsored by relatives in Australia.  To practice medicine, they
must pass an Australian Medical Council multiple-choice test that has a pass
quota of 200 migrant doctors a year.  Successful candidates can then attempt a
clinical test.  <p>
The Australian government announced that it will request a modest increase in
immigration. The planning level for 1994-95 is 73,000 under the family reunion,
skilled and business skills categories, plus 13,000 under the humanitarian
program.<p>
The government says the use of the points test to screen contractual and
independent entrants is ensuring that migrants are skilled and that most of
them are finding jobs.  The government has recently required entrants to post a
bond and pay for their own English language training (an up-front cost of
$20,000 for some migrants) is meant to avoid mismatches in the labor market.<p>
An Australian union, ACTU, has asked the government to stabilize
non-humanitarian immigration and impose tougher requirements on employers
seeking to import skilled workers.  The union argues that with an unemployment
rate of 8.7 percent there was no need to increase non-humanitarian programs. <p>
Australia had an official "whites only" immigration policy until 1973.  The
first act of the Australian Commonwealth in 1901 was to pass a law banning
non-Europeans from immigrating, and this  "White Australia," was not fully
dismantled until 1973.  <p>
Australia has gradually shifted its focus from "mother England" to Asia.  Most
trace the break to the UK joining the EU in 1973, which eliminated special
preferences for Australian agricultural exports in Britain.  The value of
Australian exports to Asia have risen from 30 percent of the country's total in
1960 to about 63 percent in 1993.  Australia had a serious recession in the
1980s, but it led to the dismantling of trade barriers that had sheltered
inefficient manufacturing industries.  <p>
Australia and New Zealand removed trade barriers between them in 1983, and
trade soared. So-called "crops and rocks" --agriculture and mining--economies
have been transformed into diverse exporters--one-third of Australia's exports
are now manufactured goods, including cars and IBM Personal Systems/2 desktop
PCs.  However, rocks and crops remain important exports-- coal alone accounted
for 11 percent of Australian exports in 1993, followed closely by gold, beef
and wool.<p>
Both Australia and New Zealand have large service exports.  In 1994, Australia
earned $1.2 billion educating 63,000 foreign students, and New Zealand's number
one earner of foreign exchange--generating $2 billion--was tourism.<p>
Many Asian business leaders are pessimistic about Australia's chances to keep
up with fast-growing Asian economies; they blame Australia's strong unions and
social welfare state.  Former Singaporean leader Lee Kuan Yew warned Australia
it could become "the new white trash of Asia."<p>
A former Australian finance minister argued for very low levels of immigration
on the grounds that much of Australia's wealth are rents from agriculture and
mining, so that population growth means a smaller per capita share for each
Australian.  A 1994 report issued by the Bureau of Immigration and Population
Research concludes: "The evidence strongly refutes the claim that immigration
leads to increases in unemployment," and in the long run generally confers
positive economic benefits on the Australian population.<p>
The opening to Asia changed immigration patterns; typically half of Australia's
immigrants come from Asia, and five percent of the Australian population was
born in Asia or are first-generation Australians with Asian parents.  The Asian
population of Australia is projected to reach eight percent by 2010 and 10
percent by 2020.  Australia accepted 140,000 Vietnamese after 1975.<p>
Australia is officially a multicultural society, which has been likened to a
"salad bowl" with different ingredients but each retaining its own distinctive
flavor.  Various cultural activities are subsidized, and there are laws against
making derogatory remarks or discriminating in jobs and housing.  For example,
the regional government in Sydney committed itself to place 7.5 per cent of
government advertisements with the ethnic media and to encourage the naming of
public places "to reflect the nature of our multicultural society". <p>
When a member of Parliament was slain in a Vietnamese suburb of Sydney, Prime
Minister Keating said that Australia "is not and can never be an 'Asian nation'
any more than we can or want to be European or North American or African."<p>

The South African government approved legislation to limit the number of
foreign job seekers.  The controls must now be approved by the Parliament.
Estimates of the number of illegal aliens in the country range from two to
eight million, although experts believe that the lower number is closer to
reality.<p>
In 1994, South Africa deported over 90,000 illegal aliens, stepped up patrols
along the Zimbabwe border, and turned the electric fence along the Mozambican
border to the "warning" level.<p>
South Africa is worried about Black joblessness--estimated at 41 percent or
four million--but also does not want to offend neighboring countries that
sheltered South Africans during the struggle against apartheid.  Migrants are
accused of stealing jobs and committing crimes in South Africa.  Estimates peg
the cost of dealing with illegal immigration about $60 million, with the bill
expected to grow to $285 million by the year 2000. <p>
The Confederation of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) has called for
eliminating laws that limit the free flow of labor in southern Africa, but
strengthen regional unions.  Cosatu has 1.4 million members, and it wants
negotiated and periodically reviewed quotas for foreign workers in each of the
region's various countries.  <p>
According to Cosatu, South Africa has been operating within the framework of
the South African Customs Union, which allows it to use Botswana, Lesotho,
Namibia and Swaziland as reservoirs of cheap labor and captive markets.<p>

<a name="RTFToC29">Egypt</a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
Complains of Migrant Treatment</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a> 
</a></h2>
A report entitled "Egyptians in the Gulf: Captives of the Sponsorship System"
blasted the Gulf states for requiring migrant workers to have a local citizen
or government agency sponsor them to obtain work and residence permits.
According to the report, some Egyptian migrants are required to work under
slave-like conditions in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia; some sponsors hold the
passports of the migrant workers they sponsor and thus control their movement.
Sponsors can reportedly have migrant workers deported at any time. <p>
In April, 79 Bangladeshi workers has accused an "untraceable" Kuwaiti employer
of not paying wages--35 dinars ($120) a month-- for five months. The workers,
including welders, electricians and drivers, also complained of poor housing.
Kuwait attributes the problem to agencies that sell entry permits to migrant
workers but do not guarantee the workers' jobs, so that, after their arrival,
the workers must accept poor jobs.<p>
There are reported to be two million Egyptians in the six Gulf states,
including one million in Saudi Arabia.  Worldwide, the report says that five
million migrant workers send $7 billion to Egypt each year.<p>
Egypt, a country of 60 million that has received $35 billion in US aid over the
past 17 years, has at least 17 percent unemployment and a declining standard of
living.  At least 50 percent to all Egyptians are illiterate.  <p>
As economic growth in Egypt has slowed to less than two percent since 1992, and
tourism has been reduced by terrorism, remittances of $5 billion annually now
almost equal the $6 billion earned from Suez Canal receipts, oil exports, and
tourism combined.  <p>
The economic outlook is grim.  Egypt's pound is estimated to be at least 40
percent overvalued, and the failure of the government to privatize the 80
percent of the factories that are state-owned, and to reduce the corruption
that wipes out small businesses and discourages foreign investment, means that
there is little hope for an export-led boom. <p>
Egypt has long benefited from its location and willingness to trade aid for
supporting the position of a super power.  In exchange for making peace with
Israel, the US has been providing about $2 billion annually in aid, of which $1
billion goes to Egypt's 400,000 man army, covering over half of Egypt's annual
defense budget.<p>

Proposals to Reduce Illegal

<tt>On May 3, 1995, Senators Kennedy (D-MA), Boxer (D-CA), and Simon (D-IL),
formally introduced President Clinton's proposals to deal with illegal
immigration, S754, the Immigration Enforcement Improvements Act</tt><p>
<tt>of 1995.  The Administration bill is similar to the proposal of Senator
Simpson (R-WY), S 269, increasing the likelihood that immigration reform will
be enacted in 1995.</tt><p>
<tt>The administration's proposal would permit US border communities as a
"local option" to impose a $3 per vehicle fee on border crossers, with the
funds used to add staff and crossing points that would speed legal crossings
and deter illegal immigration.  Other features of the proposal include:
testing a pilot worker identification system, adding 1,500 INS employees over
the next three years, reducing the appeals permitted to aliens in deportation
proceedings, and allowing the use of racketeering laws to wiretap and prosecute
alien smugglers.</tt><p>
<tt>The administration proposal would double employer penalties for hiring
unauthorized workers if the employer was also guilty of violating other laws,
such as not paying the minimum wage.  The White House also plans to increase
the number of inspectors who investigate immigration and wage-and-hour
violations.<b> </b></tt><p>
<tt><b></b>The number of documents that a new employee could present to an
employer to prove authorization to work would be reduced from 26 to six:
resident alien card or "green cards," employment authorization issued to other
work-authorized aliens, a Social Security card, a U.S. passport, a driver's
license, or a state-issued identification card.  US birth certificates would no
longer be acceptable to prove authorization to work.</tt><p>
<tt>Clinton acknowledged that the US "was built by immigrants," but he then
asserted that the US "won't tolerate immigration by people whose first act is
to break the law as they enter the country."  An April 1995 Times Mirror poll
found that 62 percent of all Americans, up from 58 percent in March 1994,
believe that the US is losing ground in dealing with illegal
immigration.</tt><p>
<tt>On May 6, 1995, President Clinton pledged to expedite the deportation of
criminal aliens from the US.  Under US law, there must be a separate proceeding
to determine whether convicted "criminal aliens" should be deported. The US
deported about 40,000 aliens who had been convicted of crimes in 1994, and
there is a backlog of another 100,000 awaiting deportation.</tt><p>
<tt>US Attorney General Janet Reno announced on May 22 a one-month pilot
program at the Men's Central Jail in Los Angeles that would place 46 INS agents
at the facility to detain all illegal immigrants upon their release.  The
inmates will be taken into federal custody, transported to a special
immigration court, and promptly deported, most on the same day they are
released from jail.  </tt><p>
<tt>The INS expects to deport 1,500 illegal aliens through this program in June
1995.  About 20 percent of the inmates in Men's Central Jail are illegal
immigrants, according to the Sheriff's Department.</tt><p>
<tt>In Congress, there are bills pending to require that aliens apprehended
twice in the US be returned to at least 300 miles from the US border.  State
and local governments would be required to cooperate with the INS or lose
federal funds.  Rep Elton Gallegly (R-CA) heads the Congressional Task Force on
Immigration Reform that is expected to make recommendations to reduce illegal
immigration to the House subcommittee in June 1995.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC3">Western
Growers to Ask for Guest Workers</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>The proposed crackdown on illegal immigration has led California's growers
to call for a guest worker program that would permit them to legally hire
foreign workers.  Senator Jon Kyl (R-AZ) is expected to introduce in June 1995
a 35-page proposal billed as a tool to "manage migration."  A similar measure
is expected to be introduced in the House.</tt><p>
<tt>The growers' proposal would substitute attestation for certification to
determine whether foreign workers are needed.  Instead of requesting permission
to import foreign workers from the US Department of Labor, and then waiting for
DOL to certify that the grower tried to recruit US workers at prevailing wages
and with offers of free housing, transportation, and contracts for work,
growers would simply assert that they had taken these steps, and DOL would be
required to approve their applications unless the applications were obviously
incomplete or inaccurate.</tt><p>
<tt>Under one scenario, farmers would fax applications that include promises to
recruit local workers and to pay prevailing wages to the US Department of
Labor.  DOL could review the request for completeness and accuracy, but not
initiate an investigation unless there was a complaint.</tt><p>
<tt>Unless DOL disapproved within seven days, growers would be free to employ
foreign workers, either workers in the US, or those abroad.  Details on how
foreign workers would obtain what would be a new work authorization visa are
sketchy.</tt><p>
<tt>Growers assert that their new program would encourage foreign workers to
leave the US when there is no work, but they have not yet spelled out
how.</tt><p>
<tt>Most of the arguments in favor of a new guest worker program are familiar.
Cheap labor is necessary to have cheap food, Americans won't do farm work, so
there is no correlation between US unemployment rates and the availability of
farm workers, and it is well known that agriculture relies heavily on
recently-arrived immigrant workers, so the US should openly deal with the
reality of immigrant farm workers.</tt><p>
<tt>The counter arguments are also well established.  Most begin with a
restatement of economic theory--there is no shortage of workers, only a
shortage of wages.  Wages have stagnated in agriculture, and if immigrant farm
workers did not continually arrive, farm wages would rise, and more US workers
would seek or remain farm workers.  Because of the higher wages, the demand for
immigrant farm workers would fall--farmers would learn how to produce food with
fewer workers, or the US might import more labor-intensive crops<b>.
</b></tt><p>
<tt><b></b>Under current law, growers anticipating labor shortages can bring to
the US non-immigrant workers under the H-2A program.  The H-2A program requires
growers to ask DOL to certify their need for workers at least 60 days before
the shortage is anticipated.  The H-2A program also requires recruitment in
places where US workers are found, and requires that growers offer to US and
foreign workers housing and round-trip transportation.  </tt><p>
<tt>About 3,000 US farmers requested 17,000 H2-A workers in FY94.  About 470
California farms and ranches apply for H2-A workers annually.  Most of the H-2A
farm workers in California are sheepherders, primarily from Chile, Mexico and
Peru. </tt><p>
<tt>California Attorney General Dan Lungren renewed his appeal for a guest
worker program on May 3.  Lungren's proposal would require foreign workers to
deposit a portion of their pay in an escrow account to encourage them to return
home.  Lungren distinguishes his proposal from the Bracero program because, he
says, it would not require foreign workers to stay with one US employer,
thereby limiting exploitation.</tt><p>

Cubans to enter the
US</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></h2>
<tt>After two months of secret talks with representatives of Fidel Castro, the
Clinton Administration on May 2 announced that the 21,000 Cubans in Guantanamo
would be admitted to the US, but that any Cubans headed for the US in the
future would be returned to Cuba.  According to reviews of how 35 years of
providing immigrant status to Cubans was reversed, political and safety
concerns forced the change in policy.</tt><p>
<tt>Politically, it was thought that riots in Guantanamo, or another wave of
rafters in the summer of 1995, might hurt Clinton's chances of carrying Florida
in 1996.  It was also feared that the mostly young men held in Guantanamo could
not be held there indefinitely, or returned to Cuba, without violence.</tt><p>
<tt>The trick was to figure out how to solve the problem created by the safe
haven policy established in summer 1994 without setting off another wave of
migration to the US.  The compromise was to count the 21,000 Guantanamo Cubans
against the guaranteed 20,000 immigrant visas provided for Cubans each year.
</tt><p>
<tt>By counting the Guantanamo Cubans against the 20,000 quota over the next
three years, fewer visas will be available for Cubans who apply to emigrate in
Havana.  This alleviated concerns by Floridians that they would again be
flooded with refugees, but angered Cuban-Americans because fewer slots are
available for those wishing to emigrate from Cuba.</tt><p>
<tt>The Administration asserted that the policy shift would save money.  The US
was spending $1 million per day to care for Cubans in Guantanamo, and the
military had requested $100 million to upgrade facilities for Cubans there.
</tt><p>
<tt>Most Cubans who come to the US move in with relatives, but the State
Department said that it would seek $100 million for medical assistance and
language training for the Guantanamo Cubans.</tt><p>
<tt>Leading Florida politicians welcomed the policy shift, saying it was the
best compromise to deal with a difficult situation.  Many Cuban Americans
welcomed the admission of Cubans in Guantanamo, but protested the new policy
that, in the future, will have the US Coast Guard returning to Cuba persons
leaving the island in small boats.  On May 9, the first 13 Cubans picked up at
sea were returned to Cuba .</tt><p>
<tt>Cubans blocked traffic in the Miami area to protest the policy change, and
on May 18, it was announced that the White House aide who negotiated the
agreement with Cuba would no longer deal in Cuban affairs.  However, it was
reported that many Cuban-Americans disapproved of the disruptive
protests.</tt><p>
<tt>Some House Democrats and Republicans criticized the Clinton administration
for "trusting the word" of Castro. About 45 percent of the Cubans in Miami
approved of the new policy. </tt><p>
<tt>There are about 1.5 million Cuban-Americans in the US, and 11 million
Cubans in Cuba.</tt><p>
<tt>The Cuban-American National Foundation, the most powerful Cuban group in
the US, wants to toughen the sanctions that the US has imposed on Cuba.  It
supports, and the Clinton Administration opposes, a proposal in Congress to
prohibit the importation of sugar from any country that buys sugar from Cuba.
The US pays a premium price for imported sugar. </tt><p>
<tt>Canada and Mexico, Cuba's two largest trading partners, also oppose
tightening the sanctions on Cuba.</tt><p>
<tt>Supporters of the Florida version of Prop. 187 say that the admission of
the Guantanamo Cubans should help the passage their initiative, which would
eliminate health, education and welfare benefits for illegal immigrants.  The
initiative would not affect Cuban exiles, but the image of thousands of
Florida-bound immigrants becomes blurred with illegal immigrants, say backers
of the Save Our State initiative.   </tt><p>
<tt>A second initiative, called FLA-187, has begun to circulate.  It also calls
for making English the official language of all state and local governments.
</tt><p>
<tt>The INS on May 19 announced that the last 203 Haitian children in
Guantanamo will be removed by June 30, 1995; it is widely assumed that most
will be admitted to the US.</tt><p>
<tt>The Cuban agreement did not mention Haitians, and on May 3, the US returned
27 Haitians to Haiti.  There were on May 1, 1995 about 350 Haitian children
under 17 among the almost 500 remaining Haitians in two camps in Guantanamo,
and they attend schools while awaiting a decision about their fate.  Most of
the 21,000 Haitians in Guantanamo were repatriated after November 1994.</tt><p>
<tt>It has proven difficult to find the children's parents and relatives in
Haiti, and some of the children hope to be admitted to the US, as are Cuban
children from the 12 Cuban camps for whom life in Guantanamo is considered by
the INS to be "an extraordinary hardship." Haitian advocates in the US alleged
that, in some instances, Haitian children were returned to strangers in
Haiti.</tt><p>

<tt>Republican success during their first 100 days of considering the Contract
with America has been credited to, inter alia, a willingness to march in
lockstep to approve even controversial measures.  But the debate over how to
deal with legal and illegal immigration has split Republicans.</tt><p>
<tt>Republican presidential hopefuls have begun to address immigration issues.
Patrick Buchanan has called for a five-year moratorium on most legal
immigration to allow the US to "assimilate" recent arrivals, a constitutional
amendment to deny citizenship to the children of illegal aliens, and stepped up
efforts to prevent illegal immigration, including a 100 mile, double-layered
fence at the most significant border-crossing points. </tt><p>
<tt>Buchanan has also called for a national law based on California's Prop.
187, which creates a state-run screening system to prevent illegal aliens from
obtaining welfare and medical benefits; Buchanan also endorses making English
the official language.  Phil Gramm and Pete Wilson have also staked out tough
immigration control stances--Gramm has called for a "lifetime" ban on immigrant
access to federal means-tested benefits such as Medicaid.</tt><p>
<tt>Senator Bob Dole is likely to follow the lead of Senator Alan Simpson on
immigration reform, supporting efforts to reduce illegal immigration, and
reducing legal immigration by about 25 percent.  Dole is reportedly skeptical
about barring legal immigrants from federal welfare programs.</tt><p>
<tt>Some Republicans favor more immigration, but none of them is running for
president.  House Majority Leader Dick Armey recently asserted that US problems
would not be diminished by less immigration, and may be ameliorated by more.
He decried restrictions on immigration, and suggested that the US "should be
thinking about increasing legal immigration."</tt><p>
<tt>Armey has vowed to oppose an improved work place identification system.
The Commission on Immigration Reform, President Clinton, and leaders on
immigration reform in both parties endorse at least pilot programs that would
make it harder for illegal aliens to use false documents to obtain US
jobs.</tt><p>
<tt>Republicans such as Armey represent the libertarian wing of the party that
wants as little government as possible, while Buchanan represents the
reconstructionist wing that wants to use government to reshape society as they
think it should be.</tt><p>
<tt>On May 3, 1995, California Governor Wilson confirmed that in 1978 his first
wife employed an illegal Mexican maid in their home, paying her $25 per day.
There was no federal penalty for US employers who hired illegal aliens until
1986, and the maid became a legal immigrant in 1979.</tt><p>
<tt>California Democrats called Wilson a hypocrite for taking such a strong
stand against illegal immigration, while having hired an illegal alien.  Wilson
and his former wife owe about $3,000 in back Social Security taxes and
penalties.</tt><p>
<tt>All other announced Presidential contenders for 1996 have asserted that
they did not employ illegal aliens.</tt><p>

<tt>On May 26, 1995, the US followed the lead of Canada and issued new
guidelines that recognize rape, domestic violence and other forms of violence
against women as possible political persecution, and thus grounds for receiving
asylum in the US.</tt><p>
<tt>According to INS Commissioner Doris Meissner, the guidelines are meant to
sensitize asylum officers to gender-based discrimination and provide a means to
evaluate a woman's asylum claim.  The guidelines do not lower asylum standards:
women must still show that their personal political convictions made them a
target of state persecution. </tt><p>
<tt>The guidelines are not expected to affect asylum cases involving forced
sterilization or abortion in China.  On May 2, a federal judge held that these
practices alone do not constitute grounds for political asylum because there
existence does not constitute individual political persecution. </tt><p>
<tt>There continues to be a debate whether women in the US who might be subject
to persecution in e.g., Algeria or Saudi Arabia because they refuse to veil
themselves should be granted asylum in the US.  In 1993, Canada granted asylum
to a Saudi student who argued that she would face persecution if she was seen
in public with her hair and face uncovered.  The US does not generally grant
asylum to persons who argue that their lifestyles clash with cultural mores at
home, and thus they would face persecution if they returned.</tt><p>
<tt>Lawyers asked that the 136 Golden Venture aliens still being detained be
released while their asylum appeals are processed.  According to the lawsuit,
about 40 percent of all Chinese asylum applications have been approved, but
only 14 percent of those from the Golden Venture have been approved, allegedly
proving that the US government manipulated the consideration of the Golden
Venture applications to send a signal that applications from persons smuggled
into the US will not be considered favorably.  Most Chinese asylum applicants
base their claims on China's one-child policy.</tt><p>

Dual Citizenship and
Devaluation</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a><a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></h2>
<tt>The Mexican Congress is considering a constitutional amendment that would
allow Mexicans to hold dual citizenship. Mexican immigrants in the US could
become US citizens, and keep their Mexican passports, plus enjoy all other
rights of Mexican citizenship except the right to vote in Mexican elections.
</tt><p>
<tt>If approved by the Mexican government as expected, some predict a surge of
Mexican applications for US citizenship among the five million Mexicans
residing in the US who might qualify for US citizenship (other estimates put
the number of Mexicans who might apply for dual citizenship at 1.5 to 2
million).  Permitting dual citizenship might create a powerful, pro-Mexican
lobby in the US, and increase the workload of US immigration
authorities.</tt><p>
<tt>Some analysts speculated that the Mexican dual citizenship proposal is a
response to the attack Mexicans face in the US after the passage of Prop. 187
and similar initiates around the nation. </tt><p>
<tt>US press reports on Mexico's economic prospects were mixed.  The Clinton
Administration announced that the US bailout was working as intended, and that
Mexico was on the road to recovery.  On May 31, President Zedillo announced
that the economy would grow at a five percent per year clip once Mexico snapped
out of its current recession.  However, the official jobless rate rose to 5.7
percent in March 1995, and projections are that the economy will shrink by four
percent in 1995.</tt><p>
<tt>In Mexico, there appears to be increasing resentment against growing
inequality.  It was widely reported that rich Mexicans --the top 10 percent of
earners received 38 percent of the nation's income in 1992--were alerted to the
possibility of devaluation in December, when the new government had trouble
re-negotiating the pact between unions and employers.  These rich Mexicans
began a run on the peso, foreigners followed suit, and Mexico was forced to
devalue.</tt><p>
<tt>Mexicans who managed to convert their pesos into dollars before the
devaluation are richer than before, and sales of some luxury goods, such as
$50,000 Mercedes, were up 25 percent in the first quarter of 1995.  Expensive
restaurants are reportedly full, while medium-priced establishments are
struggling.</tt><p>
<tt>In Mexico, reports of middle-class suffering abound.  Some 10 to 20 million
of Mexico's 90 million people were considered to be middle class before the
peso devaluation on December 20, 1994, meaning that they had credit cars, owned
cars and often houses, and could afford to take vacations.  Many middle class
Mexicans believed that Mexico had turned the corner toward first world status,
and they borrowed freely in anticipation of a continued boom.</tt><p>
<tt>Crime is reportedly up sharply.  In addition to home and street thefts, US
businesses complain that criminals posing as police stop southbound trucks
loaded with merchandise and steal it.  Some 85 percent of US-Mexican trade
moves by truck, and US businesses complain that, until police corruption is
curbed, theft losses will drive up the Mexican prices of US goods.</tt><p>
<tt>For the first time in decades, Mexico's Congress of Labor, and  the
business and peasant organizations, who form a pillar of the ruling PRI,
canceled the traditional May 1 labor day parade.  Instead, "independent" unions
drew about 75,000 protesters to Mexico City's main square, where they
complained that the government's economic policies were hurting workers.</tt><p>
<tt>There were 2,000 threatened strikes in Mexico between January and April
1995, but fewer actual strikes than in any comparable period in the 1990s,
reflecting worker fears of job losses.  In Mexico City, the government
dissolved Ruta 100, the 4,000-bus, 14,000-driver transit service for the
Federal District, reportedly because the drivers' union protested government
economic policies.</tt><p>
<tt>The U.S. National Administrative Office (NAO) created by NAFTA's labor side
agreement said it will investigate charges that Sony fired workers at its Nuevo
Laredo maquildora because they tried to affiliate with the independent
Authentic Workers Front (FAT) union.  The NAO previously dismissed similar
complaints against General Electric and Honeywell.  </tt><p>
<tt>Mexico's agricultural sector is in a crisis that is expected to produce
sharp reductions in production in 1995, and fewer farmers in the years ahead.
There are five to six million farmers in Mexico, including one to two million
landless workers.</tt><p>
<tt>In 1994/95, the production of 10 basic grains during the winter/spring
growing season fell almost 40 percent, from 11 million tons to seven million
tons, and some predict that up to 10 million hectares will not be planted
during the spring-summer agricultural cycle because of low prices and high
credit and fertilizer costs. </tt><p>
<tt>Corn tortilla prices rose 26 percent in the Mexico City metropolitan area
in early April, to about 15 cents per kilo.  Mexico is obliged to permit the
tariff-free import of 2.5 million tons of corn from the U.S. and 100,000 tons
from Canada in 1995.</tt><p>
<tt>Mexico's more open political climate is seeing more open debates about how
to put the economy back on a sure footing.  There have been calls, for example,
to restructure the tax system to reward savings and tax consumption, so that
Mexico does not have to depend as heavily on foreign investment, and to step up
private and public investment in infrastructure.  </tt><p>
<tt>Mexico attracted about $5 billion of the $19 billion Foreign Direct
Investment that flowed to Latin America in 1993, and $8 of $22 billion in 1994.
Foreign investment in Mexico is currently governed by a Foreign Investment Law
enacted December 28, 1993.</tt><p>
<tt>The Mexico crisis may delay NAFTA's expansion to include Chile.  Chile, a
country of 14 million rich in natural resources, has been growing at a seven
percent annual rate over the past eight years.  Exports in 1994 were about $12
billion, including $2 billion worth of commodities sent to the US, and imports
were also $12 billion, including goods worth $2.5 bought from the US.</tt><p>
<tt>The Clinton Administration in mid-May endorsed a bill to extend NAFTA's
free-trade provisions to Caribbean Basin Initiative countries.  Employer and
union representatives of apparel firms protested that extending free trade to
CBI nations would destroy their industries in the US.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC8">House
Solicits Immigration
Suggestions</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a><a></a></a></h2>
<tt>The House Subcommittee on Immigration and Claims on May 17 opened hearings
on legal immigration reform.  Subcommittee Chair Lamar Smith (R-TX) noted that
immigration has been increasing, and that there appears to be no "natural" end
to the current wave of immigrants in sight.  Smith argued that narrow special
interests have replaced the broader national interest in the making of
immigration policy.  </tt><p>
<tt>Ranking minority member John Bryant (D-TX) expressed concern that legal
immigrants and non immigrants are displacing US workers.</tt><p>
<tt>Susan Martin, executive director of the Commission on Immigration Reform,
promised CIR recommendations on legal immigration reform in June 1995.  She
noted that legal immigration dropped by about 10 percent in FY94 versus FY 93,
from about 880,000 to about 800,000.  </tt><p>
<tt>Preliminary data suggest that there will be about 800,000 legal immigrants
in FY95, which ends September 1995.  </tt><p>
<tt>Almost all of the witnesses agreed with Martin's three-pronged definition
of the US national interest, viz, to admit close family members of US citizens
and settled immigrants, needed workers, and humanitarian (refugee) newcomers.
The disagreement came in answer to the three fundamental immigration questions
of how many, from where, and in what status newcomers should arrive.</tt><p>
<tt>Also testifying was British-born journalist, Peter Brimelow, whose book
Alien Nation is, some say, doing for the immigration debate what Charles
Murray's book Losing Ground did for the argument that government assistance
hurts rather than helps poor Americans.  Brimelow argues that immigration is a
luxury that the US can no longer afford, because too many of today's immigrants
are too poor and too poorly educated to be assets in America.  </tt><p>
<tt>Brimelow recommended that the US limit annual legal immigration to 200,000,
which he estimates to be annual emigration.  The key failure of US immigration
policy, according to Brimelow, is that the US admits only one in six legal
immigrants on the basis of US economic needs.</tt><p>
<tt>In the ensuing debate, it became clear that there is widespread concern
about the logic of admitting minority immigrants into a country that has a
system of preferences for all minorities, including immigrants not descended
from those who suffered discrimination at the hands of US governments.
Political scientist Peter Skerry argued that, if the current system of group
rights and group politics were ended, there may be less need to worry about the
large numbers of minority immigrants who arrive, since they would not be
asserting claims to preferences.</tt><p>
<tt>A recurring issue was whether the "immigration problem" was due primarily
to the number of new arrivals, or who is arriving.  Some argued that only
numbers--and perhaps skills--matter; others argued that rights to entitlements,
such as minority preferences in the US, were the most important factor in
deciding who should immigrate.  </tt><p>
<tt>In a debate between Brimelow and TV Think Tank host Ben Wattenburg,
Brimelow argued that the 1965 Immigration Act unexpectedly triggered today's
immigration wave, and that the US is inflicting current and future assimilation
problems on itself by not stopping the unexpected wave of immigrants.
Wattenburg countered that the immigration moratorium favored by Brimelow would
put the US on the same demographic track as most of western Europe--below
replacement fertility, and thus producing an aging and stable population that
will cease to be the dominant world power.</tt><p>
<tt>Several witnesses stressed that legal immigration requires difficult
trade-offs that Congress can no longer avoid.  It was emphasized that, when
Congress considered legal immigration reform in the late 1980s, with the aim of
increasing the proportion of needed workers in the flow, the number of
immigrants was expanded so that there was no need to make difficult
trade-offs.</tt><p>
<tt>However, in a preview of the 1995 Congressional debate, witnesses
representing narrow interests such as high tech computer firms made the
seemingly contradictory argument that, even though the process for creating
software is becoming so mobile that some companies already employ e.g., Indian
programmers who are linked by satellite continuously to programmers in the US
and Europe, the US immigration system should make it easy for US firms who want
to import foreign programmers.  </tt><p>
<tt>In reaction to the 48 Hours story (See related story below) of how US
programmers were laid off and replaced by legal temporary foreigners from
India, an employer lobbyist argued that, in this case, the current system
worked as intended, since DOL has recommended that the offending company be
barred for one year from importing foreign workers.  Other witnesses argued
that the current system invites employer abuse, since employers simply "attest"
that they tried and failed to recruit US workers, and then they receive
permission practically automatically to import foreigners.  DOL investigates
only if there is a complaint, and the one year ban on importing more foreign
workers was considered by some to be inadequate.</tt><p>
<tt>A compromise between employers who want to continue getting skilled
temporary workers automatically via the attestation process, and unions who
want a detailed labor certification process, may lie in the adoption of one
aspect of the German sanctions system, which permits easy entry of skilled
workers, but also permits the confiscation of any profits earned by unlawfully
employing foreign workers.</tt><p>
<tt>Most witnesses offered general proposals and guidelines for reforming legal
immigration.  Several echoed CIR Vice-Chair Lawrence Fuchs, who noted that the
major difference between mass immigration at the end and the beginning of the
20th century is that the almost one million legal immigrants arriving each year
at the end of the century are accompanied by large numbers of non-immigrants
(almost 25 million each year) and unauthorized aliens (an estimated two to
three million entries, and 300,000 settlers annually).  Fuchs notes that the
hope for economic betterment has long been the major motivation of immigrants,
although most of those hoping to improve their lot enter through family
unification channels.</tt><p>
<tt>It was noted several times that US immigration law begins with definitions
rather than clearly articulated goals of immigration policy, that few Americans
understand the current immigration system, and that today's complex system is,
in any event, poorly administered by the INS.  </tt><p>
<tt>Some urged that the US adopt a point system for admitting immigrants--all
persons wishing to immigrate to the US would apply, and they would receive
points for e.g., being young and educated and having US relatives and/or a US
job offer.  All persons who score above the cutoff level would then enter an
annual lottery or a queue.</tt><p>
<tt>Canada and Australia each admit about half of their annual immigration flow
through such point systems.  In Canada in 1993, for example, individuals could
score up to 34 points for education and training, 18 points for having work
experience in labor short occupations, 15 points for knowledge of English or
French, and 10 points each for having a job offer, being young, and being
personally suitable--70 pints is required for entry.</tt><p>
<tt>Senator Alan Simpson (R-WY) plans to introduce in the summer of 1995 a
point system to admit legal immigrants, restarting the debate over how much
"expert systems" should be used to select immigrants.  On the one side are
mostly economists who argue that the US should use the scientific tools
available to pick immigrants most likely to succeed in the US, benefiting the
immigrants and the US.  </tt><p>
<tt>On the other side are ethnic lobbies who argue that a point system would
exclude especially poorly-educated Mexicans, and those who argue that
family-based immigration does admit ambitious immigrants who will succeed in
the US.  </tt><p>
<tt>On May 10, the Senate heard testimony on a new, fraud-proof Social Security
card that would include individual biometric information on the person to whom
the card was issued.  Simpson envisions a two-part check:  the employer
verifying that the person presenting the card is the person to whom the card
was issued, and then the employer calling in the Social Security Number to a
database to verify it, much as credit card numbers are verified.</tt><p>
<tt>There are 270 million Social Security accounts in a nation of about 265
million.  The total cost of re-issuing Social Security cards is estimated to be
$3 to $6 billion, but this cost might be spread over many years, by, e.g.,
beginning with students and school leavers seeking their first jobs.</tt><p>
<tt>Senator Jon Kyl (R-AZ) was scheduled to introduce the growers' guest worker
proposal at the May 26 Senate markup on SB 269, but the markup was
postponed.</tt><p>

</a></h2>
<tt>On May 11, the CBS-News TV program 48 Hours aired a segment on abuse of the
attestation procedures under which US employers can "attest" that they tried to
recruit US workers at prevailing wages, which allows them to bring into the US
temporary foreign professionals, such as computer programmers, to the US to
fill job vacancies.  One example of abuse was a New Jersey insurance company
that reportedly laid off 130 US programmers, and then replaced them with 130
programmers from India hired through a labor contractor.</tt><p>
<tt>Under the H-1B program, the US Department of Labor is permitted to review
employer attestations only for completeness and accuracy; DOL does not
investigate employers who are requesting H-1B workers unless there is a
credible complaint.  Some 42,000 H-1B visas were issued in 1994.</tt><p>
<tt>The hour-long show, entitled "Slamming the Door," also dealt with the rape
of a small girl by an illegal alien in a small town in Utah, the failure of the
INS to deport and keep out the US illegal aliens who have been convicted of
committing crimes here, and the costs borne by California and Florida to
provide medical care and education to immigrants and their children. </tt><p>
<tt>California reportedly spends $1.2 billion annually on medical care for
illegal aliens, in part because some Mexicans prefer to have their babies born
in the US because of the quality of medical care, and because the babies born
in the US are US citizens.  Prenatal care and emergency medical care are
available to all residents, but MediCal fraud investigators find that, in many
cases, aliens provide US addresses, but are not residents.</tt><p>
<tt>In an especially telling segment, the show reviewed how the INS sends
so-called "surrender letters" to criminal aliens asking them to appear at an
INS office before leaving the US, but only four percent of the aliens to whom
such letters are sent respond.  The INS is trying to deport convicted illegal
aliens straight from their jail cells, so that they are not freed from prison,
and then have to be re-located and removed.</tt><p>

<tt>On May 19, it was reported that the 22,000 Nicaraguans whose work permits
have been renewed on a year-to-year basis while their asylum applications are
pending may, contrary to earlier reports, have their work permits renewed once
more.  However, the INS is also likely to speed up the deportation of
Nicaraguans whose asylum applications have been denied.</tt><p>
<tt>The 1990 COP found 74,000 Nicaraguans in Dade County, while local leaders
estimate there are as many as 200,000. The first wave that arrived after the
Sandanistas took power in 1979 were welcomed as refugees from Communism, but
subsequent waves included many poorer and less educated Nicaraguans.</tt><p>
<tt>Under a US policy begun in the early 1980s, Nicaraguans were given work
permits even if their applications for asylum were rejected, and some have now
worked in the US for more than a decade.  On March 1 in Miami, about 1,000 of
the 100,000 Nicaraguans in southern Florida protested an INS policy effective
January 4, 1995 that discontinued the automatic issuance of work permits to
asylum seekers.  Today, work permits are issued to Nicaraguan and other asylum
seekers on a case-by-case basis.  </tt><p>
<tt>About 60,000 Nicaraguans are affected by the ruling; 24,000 applicants
whose cases have not yet been heard, and the rest applicants who are appealing
a denial of asylum in the US.</tt><p>
<tt>Nicaraguans say the changes will force them to take illegal jobs or return
to a economically troubled homeland.  In December, 1994, Nicaraguan President
Violeta Barrios de Chamorro urged President Clinton to allow the Nicaraguans to
remain in the US longer, because, she said, the Nicaraguan economy could not
handle the return of thousands of Nicaraguans.  Chamorro says that Nicaragua
receives $150 million per year in remittances, although exiles believe
remittances exceed $300 million. </tt><p>
<tt>Nicaragua is a country of four million with a 1992 per capita GDP of $340,
lower than Pakistan and China.  About 200,000 Nicaraguans are believed to have
returned from the US to Nicaragua since 1990.</tt><p>

<tt>The Bilingual Education Act of 1967 required local school districts to
teach subjects such as math and science in the native language of students, at
a cost in federal funds of $226 million in 1993.  </tt><p>
<tt>Bilingual education has now come under attack.  In many school districts,
all students with, for example, Hispanic surnames, are tested for English
language proficiency, and those who score in the fortieth percentile or less
are placed in bilingual classes.  Those placed in bilingual programs are
reportedly isolated from other students.</tt><p>
<tt>Many studies conclude that non-English-speaking students taught in English
do better than those taught in their native language.  In the second such study
by a major school district, a New York study concluded that those taught mostly
in English perform better in English and math and science than children taught
subjects such as math and science in their native language, with supplementary
English instruction.  The justification for bilingual education is that, by
teaching non-English speaking children in their mother tongue, they will not
fall behind other students, and will learn English. </tt><p>
<tt>One alternative to bilingual education is English as a Second Language.  In
ESL settings, students take regular classes in math and science, but then take
supplemental intensive instruction in English.  In New York City, over
three-fourths of the non-English speaking children who entered kindergarten in
ESL programs were able to move into regular classes within three years, versus
half of the children in bilingual classes.  Bilingual education costs $7,289
per student per year in New York City, versus $5,149 for regular
classes.</tt><p>
<tt>A reassessment of the overall performance of the US educational system by
Sandia concluded that "America's 'on-time' high school graduation rate has been
steady for over 20 years at roughly 75 percent to 80 percent....[but the]
recent immigration of Hispanics, many of whom come into the US school system
with inadequate background to succeed is significantly inflating dropout
figures for the Hispanic population....some students require more than four
years to complete high school, and many dropouts avail themselves of
opportunities to reenter (GED, night school, etc.), resulting in an overall
high school completion rate for young adults of over 85 percent. This rate is
improving and is among the best in the world." </tt><p>
<tt>Organizations such as the American Legion have attacked bilingual
education, bilingual ballots, and the practice of swearing in new US citizens
in a language other than English.  For example, in 1993, 76 immigrants in
Tucson became US citizens in a ceremony conducted mostly in Spanish.<b> </b> In
California, drivers may take their test in any one of 35 languages, including
Laotian, Farsi, Samoan, Western Armenian, and Tongan.  Federal law requires
that voting materials be printed in the language of any non-English speaking
group of 10,000 or more, or if they are five percent or more, of a voting
district.</tt><p>
<tt>California had a law practically mandating the teaching of "limited English
proficient" (LEP) students in their own language until 1987 but, according to a
recent reports, the state Department of Education has been captured by
administrators and unions that benefit from own-language instruction, so that
the law's requirements persist.  At a December 1994 hearing in Sacramento,
there was widespread opposition from such groups to plans that would permit the
establishment of English immersion programs if the local school board thought
that English immersion was the best way for LEP children to learn.</tt><p>
<tt>California Superintendent of Public Instruction Delaine Eastin asked the
Board of Education to increase flexibility for districts that want to use more
English-language instruction because educators are becoming convinced that
bilingual education is not the most effective means to teach non-native English
speakers.  Eastin also plans to crackdown on school districts using the
native-language model and not performing well. </tt><p>
<tt>California has 1.2 million LEP students in 500 school districts (of 5.2
million), and spends $300 million annually to educate non-English speakers in
their native languages.  The debate over bilingual education is illustrated by
the response to the Sacramento Bee editorial by William Dawson, the former
acting state superintendent of public instruction in California.  There is
disagreement on the facts:  Dawson asserts that the research shows that using
the students primary language leads to English becoming the main language after

<tt>English First, the organization that supported Prop. 63 in 1986, opposes
bilingual education.  The 4,300-member California Association for Bilingual
Education (CABE) supports the continuation of bilingual education
programs.</tt><p>
<tt>In New York City, an "immigrant high school" has been proposed to educate
up to 1,000 ninth to twelfth graders in English and native languages who have
been in the US for less than one year.  If approved by the Board of Education,
the new school would offer newcomers up to four years--rather than the usual
one year-- of native language instruction; critics allege that such newcomer
schools institutionalize the isolation of immigrant children, making it hard
for them to make the transition into regular schools.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC13">Italy,
Albania Take Measures to Control Illegal
Immigration</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>Every night hundreds of Kurds, Albanians, Yugoslavs, and Chinese are
ferried from Albania across the Adriatic Sea to Italy.  At its closest point,
Albania is 50 miles across the Adriatic Sea from Italy.  Officials estimate
over 50,000 illegal immigrants enter the European Union each year through
Italy's heel.</tt><p>
<tt>The governments of Albania and Italy announced a joint task force on May 27
to deal with the problem of illegal immigration from Albania to Italy.  Italy
has also tighten its border controls.  On May 10, the Italian government moved
1,000 soldiers to the southern Adriatic coast to deter illegal immigrants from
entering the country, and another 500 will be moved into the area during the
summer months.</tt><p>
<tt>After six days at the border, the Italian troops arrested only 30 Turkish
Kurds and one Albanian crossing the Adriatic.  The Kurds were given medical
checks, photographed, and then released and told to leave Italy within 15
days.</tt><p>
<tt>Albania has also assigned 300 troops to stop Albanians from leaving their
homeland.  The Albanian Interior and Defense ministries recently tightened
maritime and land border crossing patrols to prevent the country from being
used as a springboard for illegal immigrants.  In May 1995, Albania turned back
about 500 Turks, Kurds, Pakistanis and Chinese. </tt><p>
<tt>One reason why illegal immigrants aim to enter the EU through Italy is
that, under the 1991 Martelli law, most illegal aliens who are apprehended are
given 15 days to leave the country--only Albanians are expelled immediately. If
caught trying to enter Italy without papers, Albanians are returned on a ferry
that makes the journey between Italy and Albania three times each week.  Italy
does not require visas from former Yugoslav nationals, a violation of an
agreement made by Schengen members in January.</tt><p>
<tt>The Italian foreign minister is considering granting temporary seasonal
visas to Albanians in an effort to reduce illegal immigration.</tt><p>
<tt>An eleven-page report by the Carabinieri, the armed police of the Italian
Interior Ministry, details how Turkish smuggling organizations move Turks into
Europe through Italy.  Turkish migrants enter Italy along the Apulian coast,
having been brought across the Adriatic from Albania. Until it was blocked by
the war in ex-Yugoslavia, the more direct land route through the Balkans was
used. </tt><p>
<tt>Most of the current illegal border crossers are Kurds, attracted by the
prospect of jobs in Germany.  They are collected by the smuggling organization
in busses from such Kurdish cities as Eiazig, Bingol, Mes, Palu, Eleskirt,
Varto and Nardin, driven through Bulgaria to Albania, and parceled out to
operators who take them by truck and bus to the harbor cities of Durres and
Vlore, where Italy is only fifty miles away across the Straits of Otranto.
</tt><p>
<tt>From Italian coastal towns, they are taken by train to Milan or Voghera to
San Remo or Ventimiglia, and then taken across the French border to Marseille
and Lyon.  They are then moved from France to Germany.</tt><p>
<tt>The Carabinieri report says that the smugglers take the Turks' passports at
the start of the journey, so that they can control them more easily, and also
so that the Turks are in better position to claim asylum should they be caught.
Smugglers charge each migrant about $4,300 for the whole trip--$2,100 as far as
Albania, $1,050 for the boat crossing to Italy, another $500 or $600 to get to
France, and the rest for the final push to Germany.</tt><p>
<tt>The Carabinieri estimate that the smuggling organization has brought more
than 7,000 unauthorized migrants through Italy into France, and has earned
itself some $28 million in that way.  In the first quarter of 1995, the German
border police picked up 435 Turkish citizens attempting illegally to cross the
French and Benelux borders into Germany.  There is no estimate of how many
people may have succeeded. </tt><p>
<tt>Germany's Interior Minister, Manfred Kanther, argued that Italy must police
its borders more effectively.  Kanther has said that Italy is disregarding the
spirit of Schengen by allowing hundreds of illegal immigrants into the EU every
day.  Italy has signed but not implemented the Schengen agreement. </tt><p>
<tt>In Rome, Kanther was contradicted by Christopher Hein, director of the
Italian Refugee Council, who said that the influx of Kurds was a long-range
consequence of the German recruitment of Turkish guest workers in the 1960s.
</tt><p>
<tt>Italy is also facing an influx of illegal Chinese immigrants being smuggled
in by Chinese gangs.  Italian authorities are concerned that the Chinese and
Italian mafias are working together. </tt><p>

<tt>There are 10 to 13 million Muslims in France, Germany, the UK, and the
Netherlands, mostly immigrants and their children from North Africa, Turkey,
and the Indian subcontinent.  According to some observers, there is a marked
difference between the original "guest workers" and their children--the now 50
and older guest workers are trying to stay connected to Islam and their
homelands via satellite TV, while their children adopt the language and values
of their host countries.</tt><p>
<tt>Some Muslims living in Europe support militant movements to change
governments in their home countries, and in recent years, many have been
arrested for stockpiling weapons.  Many older Muslims who arrived as guest
workers reported that they did not think about their religion, and religious
differences, until settled and they and their children suffered
discrimination.</tt><p>
<tt>Second-generation immigrants suffer high jobless rates--often 50 percent or
more--and some turn to militant Islam because of their failures to obtain
promising jobs.  In other words, unemployment, not Islam, is believed to be at
the root of the appeal of militant Islam.</tt><p>
<tt>Fears of militant Muslims reportedly pervade the thinking of government
officials--NATO in 1995 announced that militant Islam is as much a threat to
Western Europe today as Communism was before 1989.  About 200 militant Muslims
were arrested and expelled from Western Europe in 1994.</tt><p>
<tt>Most of Europe's Muslims are in four countries:  France--five million
Muslims in a total population of 57 million, Germany, two million of 81
million, UK,1 million of 58 million, and the Netherlands, 750,000 of 15
million.  In most countries, there are relatively few mosques for these large
Muslim populations.</tt><p>
<tt>France is trying to support the development of what it calls "French
Islam," a secular type of Muslim religion. </tt><p>

<tt>The number of asylum seekers in Germany fell to 8,500 in April 1995, a six
year low.  Some 40,400 foreigners have applied for asylum in Germany so far in
1995.</tt><p>
<tt>On April 28, a Schleswig-Holstein court ruled that Kurds facing deportation
from Germany risk persecution in Turkey and should not be sent there.
SPD-governed states or Laender such as North Rhine Westphalia announced that
they would not deport Kurds until at least June 12.  Under German law, the
federal government decides whether a foreigner deserves asylum in Germany, but
it is up to state governments to remove rejected asylum seekers from the
country.</tt><p>
<tt>In early April 1995, virtually all of the EU Parliament deputies voted
against an EU-Turkey customs union to protest the Turkish government's alleged
violation of human rights in its war against PKK Kurdish separatists.</tt><p>
<tt>On May 16 Amnesty International released a report on German police
brutality against foreigners, which concluded that the police do not help
foreigners attacked by Germans, and sometimes are the cause of violence against
foreigners.  There were 70 reports of police brutality against foreigners
reported to police between January 1992 and March 1995.  Amnesty International
called upon federal and regional authorities to prevent police brutality
against foreigners. </tt><p>
<tt>More than half of the cases involved police in Berlin.  Berlin has the
largest Turkish population outside Turkey.  The city also has many Vietnamese
who were brought in during the Communist era and are now regarded as illegal
immigrants; many of those without work permits live by selling smuggled
cigarettes on the streets. </tt><p>
<tt>In 1994, there were 1,233 xenophobia-grounded violent crimes against non-
Germans in Germany.</tt><p>
<tt>German schools report that xenophobic violence is becoming more common on
school grounds--and not just in urban areas.  German authorities report
bombings near schools and drive-by shootings.  In Eppingen, a southern German
town of 18,000, a local 30-member gang of extreme rightist youths stormed a
high school graduation ceremony shouting "Deutschland den Deutschen (Germany
for the Germans)." The gang beat up pupils and teachers and engaged in
vandalism.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC16">British
Immigration Crackdown</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>Home Secretary Michael Howard has proposed new powers for public officials
to investigate claims of suspected illegal immigrants who use public services,
such as health and housing.  The proposals would allow the Home Office's
Immigration and Nationality Department to reveal confidential details of
immigration cases to other officials.  Government departments and local
authority staff would be encouraged to exchange information with immigration
officials routinely.</tt><p>
<tt>Another proposal by the Social Security Secretary would detain thousands of
asylum seekers in camps and cut welfare benefits while claims are being
considered.  The plan would also speed up the asylum process.  Similar camps
have been set up in Holland, Germany, Norway and Spain.  The British Home
Office has expressed concern about whether there would be a cost savings.  Most
asylum cases take about 32 weeks to process and there is a backlog of 55,000
cases. </tt><p>
<tt>A bill to make it illegal to employ undocumented immigrants was passed by
the House of Commons with a majority of nine votes.  Although not expected to
become law, there is speculation that Howard will introduce a similar measure
in his package of immigration reforms in the next Queen's Speech.  In Britain,
it is illegal to harbor illegal immigrants, but it is not illegal to employ
them. </tt><p>
<tt>Howard is determined to close loopholes in UK immigration laws and to
streamline the procedures for dealing with asylum-seekers.  About 80 percent of
all asylum applications are rejected -and 80 per cent of appeals are also
turned down.  </tt><p>
<tt>The majority of the 34,000 asylum applications since 1994 are not genuine,
according to the Home Office, which is drawing up procedures to decide more
quickly which applications are without merit.  Howard is reviewing the extent
to which asylum-seekers should continue to obtain welfare benefits while their
appeals are pending.  New and tougher penalties for the smugglers of illegal
immigrants are also being considered.</tt><p>

<tt>Immigration played an important role in the closing days of the French
presidential election held on May 7, 1995, which was won by Paris Mayor Jacques
Chirac with 53 percent of the vote.  On May 1, a Moroccan immigrant was drowned
when a French skinhead pushed him into the Seine river during a rally of Le
Pen's National Front.  According to the National Front, the suspect was not a
member, but was there to sabotage the demonstration.</tt><p>
<tt>Both candidates criticized Le Pen for not condemning the drowning, and both
paid homage to him as a victim of racism and xenophobia.  Both took strong
stands against illegal immigration, and Chirac urged more foreign aid for
Africa to prevent African immigration.</tt><p>
<tt>Both candidates promised to work harder to curb illegal immigration, and
Chirac has promised to enforce aggressively the 1993 Pasqua laws enacted to
make it more difficult to immigrate to France.  These laws permit random police
checks of persons to determine whether they are illegal immigrants.</tt><p>
<tt>Chirac announced that reducing France's 12 percent unemployment rate was
his top priority, and proposed a $400 monthly subsidy for two years to
employers who hire a worker who has been unemployed 12 months or more.
Employers would also be exempt from payroll taxes on such hires.</tt><p>
<tt>The French economy is expected to grow three percent in 1995, inflation is
low, and France is the world's fourth leading exporter, but there are great
concerns about persons "excluded" from French growth, including foreigners.

Into Russia</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>Migrants from ex-Soviet states and the Third World are continuing to enter
Russia.  Since 1994, about 2.5 million people have moved to Russia from the
former Soviet states, according to the Russian Federal Migration Service.
Russia's Center for Economic Affairs estimates that by the year 2000, there
will be a net migration of 2.8 million people from the former Soviet republics
into Russia. </tt><p>
<tt>Most of the migrants are Russians from Tajikistan, Azerbaijan and
Uzbekistan, but the influx from Kazakhstan is increasing.  Within Russia, the
conflict in the Caucasus has produced some 300,000 internal refugees, and a
further 320,000 have fled the war in Chechnya.</tt><p>
<tt>Many of the migrants from the Third World in Russia are in transit to the
West.  The FMS estimates the number of such migrants at 500,000, mostly from
Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia, Sri Lanka, Ethiopia, Iran,  Sudan, Angola, Pakistan
and Nigeria, and mostly awaiting a turn to go west in Moscow.</tt><p>
<tt>"Operation Foreigner," a Russian program to rid the country of illegal
Chinese immigrants, has been in effect for over one year and, according to
Russian officials, has been successful. Operation Foreigner includes more
border guards at the Chinese frontier, and closer scrutiny of documents.
</tt><p>
<tt>In some border towns, Chinese workers have both Russian and Chinese
documents, and the influx of Chinese is blamed in part on lax tourist controls.
To enter Russia, a Chinese citizen needs only a certificate or special
passport.  </tt><p>
<tt>The murder of a Russian border guard on April 12 resulted in a demand by
Cossack border troops to root out and deport Chinese citizens living there
illegally. </tt><p>

<tt>Bulgaria reports that there are between 15,000 and 40,000 illegal aliens in
the country.  The chief of police reports that there is a ring smuggling
Nigerians into the country, and that the number of Chinese increased five-fold
in the past two years.  </tt><p>
<tt>Many Chinese immigrants establish businesses in Bulgaria, which any
foreigner can do with a capital investment of 50,000 leva.  They then bring
their family and relatives into the country.  Bulgaria is the only Eastern
European country that has not canceled its agreement with China on relaxed visa
requirements. </tt><p>
<tt>A proposed law would require foreigners applying for residence in Bulgaria
to prove that they are not being sought by tax authorities.  They would also be
required to obtain approval to deal with foreign exchange from the Bulgarian
Commerce and Industry Chamber, register the amount of their foreign investment,
and present their company's financial results at the end of each year to local
authorities.  The law is an effort to stop the spread of international crime
networks in the country.</tt><p>

</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>/a></a>Maids</a></a></a></a></h2>
<tt>There are between one million and 1.7 million women employed as foreign
maids throughout Asia and Middle East.  </tt><p>
<tt>The largest number are employed in Saudi Arabia, according to a 1992
survey.  Hong Kong and Singapore each had about 65,000 maids, and  Bahrain had
40,000 maids.  The Philippines was the largest source of maids--at least
275,000 Filipinas work overseas.  The next largest exporters of maids were Sri
Lanka and Indonesia, each with about 100,000 women abroad.</tt><p>
<tt>Maids go to the Middle East because of the high wages, but there is
widespread agreement that working conditions are harsh.  Hong Kong pays three
times the wages of Singapore.  Canada was previously a popular country because
Canada granted permanent residence to maid caregivers after two years' of
employment.  Canada halted that policy in 1991, but foreign workers are allowed
to marry or change their employment.  </tt><p>
<tt>In Singapore, the number of foreign maids rose from about 5,000 in 1978 to
40,000 ten years later.  Since 1988, the number of maids has doubled again to
more than 80,000; the sharp rise is seen in data that indicate that in 1990,
the Singapore Census found that only two percent of the households relied on
foreign maids to care for children.</tt><p>
<tt>Today, one out of every ten households in Singapore has a maid.  About
three-quarters of Singapore's maids are from the Philippines; the rest are from
Indonesia, Thailand, India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh.</tt><p>
<tt>Foreign maids first started going the Singapore in the 1930s when the
so-called amahs arrived from China and Malaysia.  The amahs belonged to a
sisterhood, called kongsi, which believed in spinsterhood and female
independence.  This organization provided them lodging, helped in recruitment
and negotiated working conditions.  </tt><p>
<tt>In the 1970s, the Singapore government began to allow more foreign maids
from the Philippines, Indonesia and Sri Lanka to be employed because of the
shrinking supply of amahs and local maids.  In 1989, the government gave
married working women an income tax deduction for the wages they paid to a
foreign maid.  As the number of foreign maids grew, the government implemented
a levy on foreign maids.  Today, Singaporeans wishing to bring in foreign
domestic workers must pay a monthly fee of $US 235 to the government.</tt><p>
<tt>In June, 1995, some 50,000 Sri Lankan, Indian and Bangladeshi women are
expected to move to Singapore to replace Filipino maids.  There is some concern
that cultural differences between the South Asian and Singaporeans will create
problems that did not arise with the English-speaking Filipinas. </tt><p>
<tt>More than 60,000 Filipina maids continue to work in Singapore, despite
three planeloads of their compatriots returning home under following the
dispute over the hanging of a Filipina maid (Migration News, May 1995). </tt><p>
<tt>Philippine President Ramos has called a special legislative session to
develop a Magna Carta for Philippine nationals working abroad.  The Philippine
Department of Labor and Employment has developed proposals to prevent another
Philippine national from being hanged without a complete investigation by
increasing the number of Philippine Labor attaches, adding legal attaches and
military and policy attaches abroad to aid Filipinos victimized by unfair labor
practices. </tt><p>
<tt>The human rights organization Kalayaan called for the UK to change its laws
to protect 20,000 foreign domestic servants in the UK.  British law allows
employers to bring domestic workers into the country, but does not grant them
an independent immigration status, which means they must stay with their
original employer.  Many of the UK's foreign workers are Filipino. </tt><p>
<tt>The Trade Union without Borders helps domestic workers in Geneva, where
there are about 2800 foreign maids.  The union asserts that there are many of
abuse and exploitation of these maids. </tt><p>

<tt>On Sunday evenings thousands of Indians and Bangladeshis descend upon
vacant lots in the City Center of Singapore to talk with friends.  About 30,000
Indians and Bangladeshis work in the shipyard and construction industries of
Singapore.  Residents who live in the nearby area worry about their safety, but
are resigned to the use of vacant lots as gathering places for foreign workers.
</tt><p>
<tt>In another part of town called Little Thailand, the 40,000 Thai workers
have similar gatherings.  The 60,000 Filipino maids gather at the mass transit

<tt>Foreigners account for more than 300,000 of Singapore's 1.6 million
workers.  Foreign worker quotas were raised in 1994 in the manufacturing,
service, and shipbuilding sectors.  </tt><p>
<tt>On April 1, 1995<b> </b>the foreign worker levy was raised by 10 per cent
to prevent an influx of low-wage foreign workers.  Government officials hope
that these foreign worker policies will prevent the settlement of foreign
workers, and discourage local employers from becoming dependent on foreign
workers.</tt><p>
<tt>The Singapore Minister for Home Affairs told employers that they should not
rely upon workers from only a small number of countries, such as Malaysia and
the Philippines.  He suggested India, Burma and Vietnam as possible new sources

<tt>The Taiwan Council of Labor Affairs started accepting applications from
employers for 8,200 foreign workers.  The workers will come from Thailand, the
Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, and possibly Fiji.  The council will allow a
maximum of 35 percent of a company's work force to be foreign workers.</tt><p>
<tt>The workers will be allocated under quotas to industries, such as fabric
and sock weaving, sweater producers, electroplating, pigments, machinery
molding plants, and producers of stone products. </tt><p>
<tt>Individual companies will no longer be allowed to employ foreign workers
privately; all foreign workers will be admitted under government contracts.
The government will control the number of foreign workers in Taiwan and will
set a ceiling of five percent of the Taiwanese work force, or a maximum
460,000.  The CLA has issued permits for 250,000 foreign workers, which means
that Taiwanese employers will be permitted to bring in another 190,000 foreign
workers.  </tt><p>
<tt>There are currently about 169,000 foreign workers and 8,800 domestic
helpers in Taiwan.  They earned about US $600 per month. </tt><p>
<tt>The police said 9,333 foreign workers brought into Taiwan had run away from
their legal employers as of the end of March, 1995.  But only 3,144 of them

Workers</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>Malaysia's booming economy has drawn more than a million migrants from
Indonesia, the Philippines and Bangladesh, among others, in search of
jobs.</tt><p>
<tt>By one estimate, if economic and job growth continue at current rates--the
government projects economic growth of seven percent per year to 2020--
Malaysia will need 23 million workers in 2020, but will have only 13 million
workers.  Malaysia currently has a per capita GDP of $3200.</tt><p>
<tt>Despite promises by Malaysia's Prime Minister to permit industrial wages to
rise, and to reduce the country's reliance on foreign workers, the government
is considering extending the work permits for foreign workers.  The Malaysian
Department of Human Resources proposed a 3+2 formula which would allow work
permits for foreign workers to be extended for two years upon the request of an
employer.  </tt><p>
<tt>Foreign workers are currently given two-year work permits, with the
employer having the option of extending the permit for one year.  Employers
have ask the Malaysian government to permit another two year extension so that
they can keep trained workers.</tt><p>
<tt>Malaysia is considering imposing stiffer fines on recruitment agencies who
employ foreign workers in illegal activities.  Some of the proposed penalties
include higher fines, jail and caning.  A bill with the proposed changes is
expected to be submitted by the Attorney General's office before the end of
1995.</tt><p>
<tt>Malaysian authorities arrested over 3,000 illegal Indonesian migrants in
just two months, mostly in the provinces of Johor, Selangor, Melaka and Negri
Sembilan.  Many of the illegal immigrants are arriving by boat.  Those caught
are held temporarily in one of five immigration detention camps. </tt><p>
<tt>In 1992, the government licensed about 300,000 illegals from these camps
for temporary employment in households, plantations and the construction
industry to ease the acute labor shortage in these areas.</tt><p>
<tt>Malaysia is considered an economic success story, but there continue to be
concerns about the country's treatment of unions.  The Malaysian electronics
industry employs 140,000 workers, including 120,000 women, but labor law bans
unions from this "pioneer" industry in which the government hopes to lure
foreign investment.  </tt><p>
<tt>Most electronics workers are young women who start on the assembly line at
age 17 to 25, and stay for less than 10 years, earning $140 to $250 per month.
A Spring 1993 survey reported that electronics workers were 75 percent female,
63 percent Malay, and 57 percent skilled.  </tt><p>
<tt>Skilled workers were paid an average $1.15 per hour or $221 per month,
including benefits.  Unskilled workers were paid an average $133
monthly.</tt><p>
<tt>The Australian government reports that fewer Malaysians are settling in
Australia.  Between 1984 to 1994 over 40,000 Malaysian, 16 percent of all
settlers from Southeast Asia, settled in Australia.  Malaysia was the third
largest source of settlers after Vietnam and the Philippines. </tt><p>

<tt>The Philippines, sometimes called "the sick man of Asia", grew by 5.1
percent in 1994, giving the country a GDP of about $50 billion, and exports of
$12 billion.  Foreigners promised to invest $2.5 billion in the Philippines in
1994.</tt><p>
<tt>Earlier in 1995, there were fears that the Philippine bubble would burst,
as did Mexico's because so much of the foreign money coming into the country is
portfolio investment in stocks and bonds.  The Ramos government reportedly
killed two birds with one stone by permitting competition in the telephone
industry--reducing the power of the local oligarchy, and lowering costs.</tt><p>
<tt>The Philippines, with 68 million people, has one of the fastest population
growth rates in Asia, about 2.2 percent, versus 1.4 percent in Thailand, which
has 60 million residents. But the Catholic church in the Philippines--85
percent of Filipinos are Catholics--insists that there be no governmental
support for birth control. </tt><p>
<tt>President Fidel Ramos called the Philippine Congress into a special
one-week session from May 21 to 28 to approve measures to protect overseas
workers.  The government is also calling on the Philippine Senate to approve an
international convention to protect the rights of migrant workers. </tt><p>
<tt>The number of Philippine overseas workers declined by 2.5 percent in the
first quarter of 1995 compared to the same period last year.  The Middle East
remained the primary destination of overseas workers with 48 percent, while 36
percent went to other Asian countries. </tt><p>
<tt>An estimated 100,000 illegal aliens in the Philippines will be offered
amnesty under a new program.  Under the Alien Social Integration Act of 1995,
foreigners who entered the Philippines before June 20, 1993 can apply for legal
status.  The amnesty program runs from June 1, 1995 through December 31, 1996.
Illegal aliens with pending criminal cases and refugees can not apply under the
program. </tt><p>
<tt>The Philippines government announced that it will also closely monitor
foreign students after police officials said that some were linked to
international terrorist groups.  The police will verify the identities of all
foreign students and identify any who have overstayed their visas.</tt><p>

<tt>Over the weekend of May 20-21, 1995, several thousand Vietnamese boat
people rioted while being transferred from one camp to another in Hong Kong,
leaving 200 Hong Kong police and Vietnamese hurt.</tt><p>
<tt>The cause of the riot was ostensibly a bill in the US House of
Representatives that provides $30 million to resettle in the US about half of
the 40,000 Vietnamese boat people being held in detention camps through out
Asia.  </tt><p>
<tt>The bill, proposed by Republicans and opposed by the Clinton
administration, would permit the money only to be spent on resettling these
Vietnamese in the US, thereby overturning the US and international policy-known
as the Comprehensive Plan of Action-- of returning to Vietnam those who remain
in camps throughout Asia by the end of 1995.  If approved, the bill would end
US contributions to the UN program that has since 1990 returned to Vietnam
persons found to be economic migrants.  A vote on the bill is scheduled for
June.</tt><p>
<tt>There are about 21,000 Vietnamese in camps in Hong Kong, and UNHCR
officials there expressed fear that, as the House proposal becomes known in the
camps, few Vietnamese will return to Vietnam voluntarily, and more may leave
Vietnam in small boats.  In 1994, a false rumor that Japan was accepting
Vietnamese boat people prompted more than 1,000 Vietnamese to sail for that
country.</tt><p>
<tt>The UN and the Hong Kong government started an information campaign shortly
after word of the US proposals began to filter through the detention camps,
emphasizing that that no US law has been enacted that will reverse the decision
to return them to Vietnam.  But some believed that, with powerful champions in
Congress, they should resist returning to Vietnam in the hope that the bill may
yet be enacted.  </tt><p>
<tt>On April 30, 1975, Saigon (now Ho Chi Minh city) fell to North Vietnamese
troops.  Some 1.2 million southeast Asians eventually left their countries of
origin, and most were resettled in the US.  There are over southeast Asians in
California, and about 60 percent are on public assistance.</tt><p>
<tt>As Americans re-debated whether the US should have fought in Vietnam, there
were remarkably few reflections on how the southeast Asians are faring in the
US and California.  Most profiles stressed the success stories--the children of
refugees who are valedictorians in high school and the success of refugees in
business, including the Cambodians, who dominate California's donut business.
A few profiles emphasized the welfare dependency of Southeast Asians in
California, and the tendency of youth gangs to break into homes of recent
arrivals and rob those unlikely to complain to police.</tt><p>

<tt>Bangladeshi troops have been ordered by the government to shoot-on-sight
any "illegally entered foreigners" who violate the night curfew along the 2,590
mile-border with India.  Bangladeshi officials say the shoot-on-sight order is
necessary to stop smuggling of illegal immigrants.  </tt><p>
<tt>News reports said that those entering Bangladesh were being "pushed" out of
India by Indian authorities on the grounds that they were illegal
immigrants.</tt><p>
<tt>Almost two million Bangladeshis are believed to have migrated to the
northeastern Indian state of Assam over the past 20 years, and clashes between
natives and immigrants have killed 7,000 since the 1980s.  Instead of cracking
down on illegal Bangladeshi immigrants, India is now emphasizing the need to
reduce emigration pressures from the world's most densely population
nation--there are 2,200 people per square mile in Bangladesh.</tt><p>
<tt>Indian estimates are that 15 million former East Pakistanis and
Bangladeshis--some of whom were Hindu--have settled in India since 1947.</tt><p>
<tt>Karachi, Pakistan is a vast city spread over 30 miles of semi-desert area,
whose population has been increasing by six percent per year.  Police in
Karachi estimate that up to 20 percent of the city's 10 million residents are
illegal aliens.  An estimated 1.2 million are Bangladeshis, followed by 200,000
Burmese, and 84,000 Afghans.  </tt><p>
<tt>Each wave of immigrants allegedly adds another slum to the city.  According
to Pakistani officials, illegal migrants cause crime and take jobs away from
Pakistanis.  Pakistan has been unable to deport illegal Bangladeshis, because
Bangladesh does not take back citizens who have left the country illegally.
</tt><p>
<tt>Pakistani employers reportedly prefer to hire the illegal workers because
they are willing to work for lower wages.  Pakistani police recommend a
legalization program, and then a 1000 rupee-- $33--charge for a work permit.
Some human rights lawyers do not want the Pakistani police to have any role in
immigration, since they allege that the police are responsible for extorting
bribes from immigrants.  Instead, they call for better border controls.</tt><p>
<tt>On March 12, the provincial government of Karachi cracked down on illegal
aliens and arrested several hundred.  The Pakistan government blames much of
the terrorism in the port city on illegal immigrants, primarily muhajirs, who
are Urdu-speaking migrants from India and their descendants. </tt><p>
<tt>Pakistan's economy grew by four percent in 1994, and foreign direct
investment topped $300 million, but it remains one of the world's largest poor
countries--GDP per capita was just $420 in 1992, versus $310 in neighboring
India.</tt><p>

<tt>At a May 22 Israeli cabinet meeting, several ministers demanded that the
government limit the country's increasing dependence on foreign guest workers.
On the same day, the Interior Minister expelled 14 illegally employed Thai and
Filipino workers. </tt><p>
<tt>The Minister of Labor and Social Affairs asked the government to stop labor
brokers or manpower companies from importing foreign guest workers.  The
minister said that the agencies are responsible for deteriorating working
conditions of foreign workers.</tt><p>
<tt>Israel is slowing reopening its borders to Palestinian workers after two
year of restrictions following a wave of terrorist attacks.  There are now over
30,000 Palestinian workers permitted to cross the border daily; half are
agricultural workers, and the rest construction workers.  There were about
100,000 Palestinians workers in Israel before the borders were closed following
terrorist attacks two years ago. </tt><p>
<tt>Israel in 1995 accelerated the substitution of Asian and European workers
for Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza, importing 70,000 foreign workers
from Romania, Thailand, Ghana, and Turkey since 1993.  In some cases,
Palestinians are being asked to train other foreign workers, who usually earn
the minimum wage of about $2 per hour.  Some Israeli employers prefer Asian and
European unskilled workers because they reportedly have little knowledge of the
Arab-Israeli conflict.</tt><p>
<tt>Israeli and Palestinian officials in March 1995 began negotiations on the
possible repatriation of Palestinians who left what is today Israel, the West
Bank, and Gaza.  Some 600,000 to 800,000 Palestinians are believed to have left
what is today Israel in 1948, and another 220,000 to 330,000 left the West Bank
and Gaza in 1967.  Today, there may be as many as three million Palestinian
refugees and their children.</tt><p>
<tt>There are about three million Palestinians living in the West Bank and Gaza
today, and all sides agree that the economy there cannot support immigration.
However, Palestinian officials are committed to the gradual and unconditional
return of all refugees.</tt><p>
<tt>US officials are calling on Israel to find short-term solutions to
alleviate Palestine unemployment, which is 60 percent in Gaza.  Palestinian
economists estimate that Palestinian workers lose $1 million each day that
Israel closes the border.  Israel plans to announce a series of public works
programs inside the Palestinian Authority.</tt><p>

<tt>The Saudi government plans to offer amnesty to an estimated 500,000 illegal
immigrants in the country.  Most are Moslems who entered Saudi Arabia on
pilgrims' visas, often with no intention of returning home.  Since January
1995, Saudi Arabia deported over 5,000 Indians who overstayed their pilgrims'
visas.  Earlier in the year, Saudi officials deported one thousand Bangladeshi
and Pakistanis who had overstayed their visas. </tt><p>
<tt>Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, gives Moslems who want to go to Saudi
Arabia on pilgrimages only exit visas.</tt><p>
<tt>There is very little crime committed by foreigners despite the fact that
most are young men separated from their families--an average 150 per year have
been arrested in 1993-94.  However, Saudis complain that Catholic nannies pass
on their religion to the children in their care; that the abundance of foreign
workers tends to make Saudis think that they deserve to manage others, leading
to an excess of middle managers; and that the availability of foreign workers
deters the entrance of women into the economy and labor market.</tt><p>
<tt>Saudis consider many of these illegal immigrants to be fortune hunters who
simply want to make as much money as soon as possible, rather than learn Arabic
and Saudi culture.  The five million immigrants among the 12 million residents
of Saudi Arabia remit an estimated $4 billion annually to their countries of
origin.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC33">Urban
Institute Workshop on Guest
Workers</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a><a></a></h2>
<tt>As Congress and the administration step up their efforts to reduce illegal
immigration, and consider proposals to reduce legal immigration and to restrict
the access of legal immigrants to welfare, agricultural employers prepared to
make another push for a guest worker program.  Some feel that guest workers are
the natural second-best option for very divergent interests unable to get what
they really want.  For example, ex-President Salinas of Mexico and California
Governor Wilson agree on little else about immigration other than that guest
workers are preferred to the status quo.</tt><p>
<tt>The Urban Institute on May 23 held a workshop entitled "Guest Workers:  New
Solutions or New Problems?"  A new Urban Institute Working Paper notes that all
of the OECD countries, plus many others, have programs that aim to add workers
to the labor force, but not settled residents to the population.  However, in
every case, the results are the same, best expressed in the aphorism that there
is nothing more permanent than temporary workers.</tt><p>
<tt>The usual rationale for guest worker programs is economic--admit foreign
workers to fill labor shortages and thereby obtain the mutual benefits of more
production and economic activity in the labor-importing country, while
providing jobs and wages for the emigration country.</tt><p>
<tt>However, dependence and distortion are everywhere associated with guest
workers.  These terms refer to the fact that some guest workers settle, that
employers assume that foreign workers will continue to be available, and that
foreign jobs will continue to be available.  These factors combine to create
powerful migration networks that make immigration control a more difficult
objective to achieve.</tt><p>
<tt>The Urban Institute Working Paper emphasized that the rationale for guest
worker programs is changing.  During the 1960s, for example, guest workers were
practically synonymous with thousands of Turks and Algerians arriving every day
in Germany and France to fill macro or economy-wide labor shortages during
periods when the unemployment rate was less than one percent.  </tt><p>
<tt>Today, guest workers are imported to herd sheep in the American west, pour
drinks in mountain resorts, and be physical therapists--these foreign workers
are usually filling very specific labor shortages in labor markets with high
unemployment.  </tt><p>
<tt>The instruments needed by governments to fill such precise labor
shortages--active and credible employment services and control over illegal
immigration--are often lacking, making the determination over whether guest
workers are needed an increasingly contentious issue.</tt><p>
<tt>After the government certifies that foreign workers are needed to fill
vacant jobs, employers may be free to recruit in any country and under any
circumstances that they want, or they may be required to take the workers
arranged by the ES in particular countries.  </tt><p>
<tt>The third and most debated aspect of guest worker programs is how to avoid
employer dependence and worker settlement.  Governments in East Asia are trying
to avoid what they see as the mistakes made in Europe and North America by
levying taxes or fees on employers who hire foreign workers, and requiring some
of the foreign workers' earnings to be put into government savings accounts.
If workers do not claim these wages in their country of origin at the end of
their contracts, the wages are forfeited.</tt><p>
<tt>The mostly western growers proposal for a 1995 guest worker program for US
agriculture makes major changes to the current program under which foreign
workers are permitted to be admitted for temporary US farm jobs.  About 3,000
US farm employers bring 17,000 so-called H-2A alien farm workers to the US each
year, so that legal temporary foreigners are less than one percent of the
nation's 2.5 million hired farm workers.</tt><p>
<tt>But about two-thirds of all farm workers in surveys are foreign born, and
about 25 percent are unauthorized, up sharply from less than 10 percent
authorized in 1990.  Farmers argue that if Congressional plans to reduce
illegal immigration are successful, and because many farm workers want to find
other jobs, then agriculture will face escalating labor shortages as
immigration control efforts become more effective.</tt><p>
<tt>Farmers fearful that the US Department of Labor may not agree that they
need foreign workers want to bypass DOL and substitute an attestation procedure
for the current certification procedure.  Under their proposal, farm employers
would certify that they recruited and failed to find US workers while offering
prevailing wages etc, and the DOL would be required to agree unless it could
show that the farm employer was lying.  Farmers would then make individual
agreements with foreign workers that would not be subject to government
scrutiny unless there were complaints.</tt><p>
<tt>Farm worker advocates attacked this proposal, charging that it undoes a
half century of regulations that were established to prevent the exploitation
of US and foreign farm workers.  The growers' plan is scheduled to be
introduced May 26 during the mark up of the Kennedy-Simpson immigration reform
proposal; both Kennedy and Simpson oppose the growers' proposal.</tt><p>
<tt>A second paper on the economic crisis in Mexico and trends in Mexico-US
migration argued that the current migration hump-- the temporary increase in
migration being experienced in 1995--was a predictable result of Mexico-US
economic integration under NAFTA.  The major reasons for the migration hump
include the fact that, despite NAFTA, there continued to be a demand-pull of US
jobs that attract Mexican migrants, NAFTA-inspired restructuring in Mexico
increased supply-push pressures, and well-established networks efficiently move
migrants across borders.</tt><p>
<tt>NAFTA also spurred long-term foreign direct investment in Mexico, but FDI
takes time to create jobs that deter migration.  An overvalued peso throughout
1994, the NAFTA "hope factor" that made devaluation unnecessary, and the
Chiapas uprising and several assassinations provided no opportunity for an
orderly or gradual devaluation.  Instead, a massive devaluation occurred on
December 20, 1994, and a US led international bailout was required to stabilize
Mexico's economy.</tt><p>
<tt>The peso devaluation is certain to stimulate Mexico to US migration in
1995--the only question is how much.  According to most analyses, at the
margin, there is a 1 to 0.7 relationship, i.e., a one percent peso devaluation
increases Mexico-US migration by seven-tenths of one percent. </tt><p>
<tt>In order to reduce Mexico-US migration, the US could step up border
enforcement, try to channel illegal migrants into a guest worker program, or
persuade Mexico to prevent or deter exits.  The paper concludes that none of
these short-run measures is likely to provide a quick fix, and that the US
would be best off if it supported Mexico in pursuing the long-run policies that
are necessary to deter emigration, viz, stick to stable macro policies,
implement political reforms, and develop Mexico's human and physical
infrastructure.</tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC34">Immigration
in the Americas</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>The North-South Center at the University of Miami held a workshop May 19-20
on International Migration and Immigration Policy in the Americas to explore
the current dimensions and reactions to migration.</tt><p>
<tt>Participants were reminded that, despite polls suggesting that the fear of
mass immigration is now equal to the fear of the spread of nuclear weapons--72
percent of those polled put these threats at the top of their list-- US doors
to immigrants, non immigrants, and unauthorized entrants remains open.  Every
day, about 2,500 legal immigrants arrive, as do 60,000 non immigrants, and
about 1,000 unauthorized aliens settle here.</tt><p>
<tt>The year 1994 was the year that the Clinton administration took actions to
deal with immigration issues, and 1995 is shaping up to be a year of
Congressional action on immigration.  In 1994, the Clinton administration
announced reforms that deny work authorization to asylum applicants, stepped up
border control efforts in Texas, Arizona, and California, and changed migration
policy on Haiti and Cuba several times.  In the case of Haiti, it was noted
that some Haitians assert that their country is the only Caribbean nation that
"must" remain democratic so that Haitian migrants have no claim to US
asylum.</tt><p>
<tt>Immigration bills are working their ways through both houses of Congress.
The bills most likely to be enacted in 1995 would deal with illegal immigration
by experimenting with new systems through which newly-hired workers prove to
their employers that they are authorized to work in the US.  The debate over
internal enforcement, it was agreed, is whether emphasis should be placed on a
data base against which employers can check worker numbers, whether the
emphasis should be on a secure card for all workers, or whether emphasis should
be placed on stepped-up workplace enforcement.</tt><p>
<tt>There was extensive discussion at the conference about why the US seems
poised to reduce legal and illegal immigration.  Some argued that the
anti-immigrant mood represents another period of nativism, defined by historian
John Higham as a combination of nationalism and ethnic prejudice.  But it was
also noted that there are powerful forces operating at individual, family, and
village levels, as well as in emigration countries and in some sectors of the
US economy, that will make it very difficult to enact and enforce effective
immigration controls.</tt><p>
<tt>One in-between outcome of an effort to reduce immigration when there are
strong forces that want it to continue is to acknowledge inevitable migration,
but seek to regulate it in a manner that does not lead to settlement.  This is
the definition of a guest worker program, and several participants thought that
the US may develop different policies for different countries--virtually
stopping e.g., Haitian immigration, because it is not an economic necessity,
but trying to manage Mexican migration with a guest worker program.</tt><p>
<tt>The conference addressed both south-to-north flows of people within the
Americas as well as global migration flows.  It was noted that there is an
alphabet soup of international organizations to deal with the one-sixth of the
world's GDP that flows across borders in the form of trade, but few
international organizations to deal with the two percent of the world's
population that flows across borders.  </tt><p>
<tt>There was considerable discussion of why states should give up power to one
or more international organizations to deal with migration.  In contrast to
trade organizations, for example, there is no theory or consensus that
countries should be open to immigrants, but there is a theory that countries
will grow faster if they are open to trade in goods.  </tt><p>
<tt>Second, it is widely recognized that freeing up trade creates winners and
losers, so that states often willingly give up power to international
organizations, and put the blame for free trade or tight money decisions on the
World Bank or the WTO.  Immigration also creates winners and losers, but there
is less agreement that states should turn at least some migration control over
to international organizations to help them to deal with domestic winners and
losers in the wake of immigration reforms.</tt><p>
<tt>Third, it is widely recognized that trade channels tend to narrow over time
as special interests attempt to erect barriers to trade, so international
organizations that regulate trade matters look skeptically at the attempts of
countries to interfere with the free flow of goods.  Migration channels, by
contrast, can widen over time as networks are set in motion, so that an
international organization might be forced to play dual roles, justifying
restrictions in countries that want to limit immigration, and justifying the
lowering of migration barriers on behalf of countries that want to increase
labor exports.</tt><p>
<tt>National attitudes toward migration have evolved since the mercantilist
era, when especially skilled craftsmen were hoarded and emigration was
discouraged.  In the 19th century, emigration became a safety valve for
industrializing European societies.</tt><p>
<tt>Many other topics were raised in the free-flowing discussion.  For example,
just how much of the "immigrant problem" in industrial democracies is created
by these rich countries recruiting cheap labor, or sending capital abroad that
disrupts traditional production relationships and thereby sets migration in
motion?  What does it mean to be a member of more open and diverse societies
such as the US, and how easy should the US make naturalization?  </tt><p>
<tt>The current immigrant wave raises doubts about whether the US will be able
to successfully integrate the diverse newcomers arriving today.  The same fears
were raised at the beginning of the century, and it was argued that the key to
integration is the second generation, an issue on which there are signs for
optimism and pessimism.</tt><p>
<tt>Most authors concluded that there is a permanence in the migration they
studied, whether Salvadorans in Long Island, or Colombians in Venezuela.  In
each case, a long period in a richer country leads to permanent settlement for
a significant fraction of the immigrants.</tt><p>

Moves on Immigration

<tt>In June 1995, the House and Senate took actions that are likely to reduce
legal immigration and increase efforts to reduce illegal immigration.  If
enacted, US residents who sponsor the admission of their relatives would be
required to support them, and immigrants may be barred from public assistance
programs.</tt><p>
<tt>The Senate immigration subcommittee marked up and approved the Immigrant
Control and Financial Responsibility Act of 1995 (S 269) on June 14, 1995 by a
vote of 4-2.  The bill, sponsored by Sen. Alan Simpson (R-WY), deals primarily
with illegal immigration.  </tt><p>
<tt>Employers who hired illegal aliens could, if S269 is enacted, face double
penalties if they also are found to have willfully or repeatedly violated the
Fair Labor Standards Act, the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker
Protection Act, or the Family and Medical Leave Act.  The bill would add 300
INS inspectors to enforce laws against alien smuggling and unlawful employment
of illegal immigrants, nearly doubling their number.</tt><p>
<tt>Penalties for hiring illegal aliens would be increased.  For a first
violation, the fine would go from $250 to $1,000 per illegal alien hired.  The
Administration is given eight years to develop an automated system through
which US employers can determine whether newly hired workers are legally
authorized to work in the US, adopting a recommendation of the CIR in September
1994.</tt><p>
<tt>The Justice Department supports testing an automated verification system,
but it opposes the eight-year timetable to have such a system in place.</tt><p>
<tt>Simpson's bill would also require Social Security numbers to be issued with
standardized national birth certificates and, when a person reaches 16 years,
he/she must add a biological identifier to the Social Security card or similar
work authorization document, such as a fingerprint.  A $1 border crossing fee
was included in the subcommittee bill, with the moneys raised used to add
inspectors to speed up legal crossings.  The bill also authorizes the hiring of
3,500 additional Border Patrol agents.</tt><p>
<tt>Simpson's bill would also increase the responsibilities of an immigrant's
sponsor to financially support any immigrants they sponsor or petition to have
admitted to the US.  It would also make illegal immigrants ineligible for most
public assistance programs, whether funded by federal, state, or local
governments.</tt><p>
<tt>The subcommittee rejected the 50,000 per year cap on annual refugee
admissions recommended by the CIR, but included a provision that requires
applicants for asylum to file their applications within 30 days of arriving in
the US.</tt><p>
<tt>On June 21, 1995, House Subcommittee on Immigration and Claims chair Lamar
Smith (R-TX) held a press conference to announce that he would be introducing
the Immigration in the National Interest Act of 1995 to reduce legal and
illegal immigration.  A hearing Smith's proposal, which deals with both legal
and illegal immigration, was held on June 29.</tt><p>
<tt>Under Smith's proposal, legal immigration would be reduced by about
one-third to about 535,000 per year, and employers would be required to check
the Social Security numbers of new hires.  The US Border Patrol would be
doubled to 10,000, and aliens who enter the US illegally could be fined $50 to
$250.</tt><p>
<tt>Smith's 300-page proposal would maintain the three "front doors" though
which legal immigrants enter the US, but each would be narrowed.  Spouses and
minor children of US citizens could continue to enter the US in unlimited
numbers (about 195,000 per year today); up to 85,000 spouses and minor children
of legal permanent residents would be admitted each year; and up to 50,000
parents of US citizens could immigrate, making family immigration 330,000 per
year.</tt><p>
<tt>Smith's proposal would keep immigrants admitted for economic reasons at
about current levels by permitting the annual entry of 135,000 skilled workers,
professionals, managers and investors.  Up to 70,000 refugees, accepted
applicants for asylum, and other humanitarian immigrants could be admitted each
year.  For five years, Smith would permit an additional 50,000 spouses and
children of legal residents on waiting lists to enter the US.</tt><p>
<tt>Immigrants who sponsor their relatives for admission would be legally
responsible for ensuring that they do not become "public charges" during their
first seven years in the US.  Becoming a public charge is defined as receiving
means-tested public assistance for 12 or more months within seven years of
arrival.</tt><p>
<tt>Smith's bill does not include a border-crossing fee or an agricultural
guest worker program.  It does include a number of pilot programs, such as the
collection of departure records to determine how many tourists and other
non-immigrants do not depart as scheduled; the use of closed military bases to
detain aliens; and the return of aliens apprehended to the interior of their
countries of origin.</tt><p>
<tt>On June 29, a 54-member House Task Force headed by Rep Gallegly (R-CA)
released a report that upped the ante in efforts to reduce illegal immigration
to the US.  The Task Force's 150 page report recommends that illegal aliens be
barred from receiving all public benefits except for emergency health care, and
that, to be reimbursed, a hospital would have to notify the INS before
releasing emergency unauthorized patients.  Illegal alien children would be
barred from attending public schools, and aliens apprehended attempting to
enter the US illegally would be subject to escalating fines and penalties,
including forfeiture of their assets.<b></b></tt><p>
<tt><b></b>The Senate approved a welfare reform proposal in June that goes
further than the House welfare reform approved in March 1995 by making it
harder for some immigrants to obtain Supplemental Security Income (SSI) even
after they become naturalized US citizens.  Under the Senate welfare proposal,
an applicant for SSI would be asked if he or she had a sponsor.  If the
immigrant had a sponsor, then the applicant for SSI would be deemed to have
available to him/her, in additional to his/her own income, the sponsor's
income, for the purpose of determining eligibility for SSI payments.</tt><p>
<tt>There is no current bar to legal immigrants applying for most public
assistance programs.  Immigrants who apply are asked if they had a sponsor to
get into the US and, if they did, they can be "deemed" under a few programs to
have access to their sponsors' income for three to five years.  Welfare reforms
would expand the number of assistance programs for which sponsors' income can
be deemed to be available to the immigrant applicant for assistance.</tt><p>
<tt>The House welfare reform bill was criticized for denying federal assistance
under five programs to legal immigrants until they become US citizens (MN,
April 1995), but deeming under the House bill would end when the immigrant
became a US citizen.  The Senate bill, critics allege, would change the US
tradition of equal treatment for all US citizens by creating two classes of US
citizens, those who were born in the US, and those who were naturalized US
citizens with sponsors.</tt><p>
<tt>Sen. Simpson, who sponsored the amendment, argued that immigrants should be
self supporting.  There were 738,000 aliens receiving SSI in December 1994,
including 16 percent from Mexico, 10 percent from the ex-USSR, seven percent
each from Cuba and Vietnam, and five percent each from China and the
Philippines.</tt><p>
<tt>The US Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal that the Clinton
Administration's decision to admit Cuban children from Guantanamo, and return
170 Haitian children, amounted to illegal discrimination, thereby affirming the
right of the US to return these Haitian children to Haiti. On June 27, 111
Haitians, including 74 children were flown to the US.  There are still 210
Haitians in Guantanamo, including 48 unaccompanied children. </tt><p>

Recommends Less

<tt>The nine-member US Commission on Immigration Reform, headed by Barbara
Jordan, recommended at a June 7 press conference that legal immigration be
gradually reduced, and that priority for entry be reshuffled to emphasize the
unification of nuclear families in the US and the admission of college-educated
foreigners needed to fill US jobs.</tt><p>
<tt>The CIR tackled the difficult trade-offs inherent in deciding how to select
immigrants.  If enacted, the CIR proposal would keep immigration at roughly
current levels for the next five years, but favor nuclear over extended
families.  The CIR recommended that Congress review immigration levels every
three to five years.</tt><p>
<tt>After the new plan is fully phased in, family unification would remain the
primarily door for immigrants to enter the US, accounting for 400,000
immigrants per year.  Immediate family members of US citizens--spouses,
children, and parents-- would gain admission upon application, but three of the
four existing family preferences would be eliminated--those that permit the
unmarried adult sons and daughters, the married sons and daughters, and the
brothers and sisters of US citizens to gain priority to immigrate.</tt><p>
<tt>The number of immigrants admitted because of their skills or to fill vacant
US jobs would be reduced from 140,000 to 100,000 per year.  Most immigrants
admitted for economic reasons would need a BS or equivalent.  </tt><p>
<tt>Instead of the current labor certification system, US employers who are
granted permission to bring immigrants into the US to fill job vacancies would
have to pay "substantial fees" that would be used to educate and train US
workers.  US employers would also have to pay the immigrants at least five
percent more than prevailing wages to ensure that their presence does not
depress the wages of US workers. </tt><p>
<tt>Immigrants admitted with US offers of employment would be "conditional" for
two years.  They would become permanent immigrants only if they had the same
job or had good reason to change jobs after their two-year probation.</tt><p>
<tt>The CIR recommended that the 10,000 immigrant visas currently made
available for unskilled immigrants--the visas that some Americans use to permit
their nannies or gardeners to become immigrants--be eliminated.  </tt><p>
<tt>The number of refugees admitted annually would be reduced from about
120,000 annually to 50,000 per year.</tt><p>
<tt>The CIR would soften the impact of the family unification changes by
accelerating the unification of nuclear families, making 150,000 additional
visas per year available until the 1.2 million backlog of spouses and minor
children waiting to join permanent immigrants in the US is eliminated (the
current second family preference).  However, another 1.9 million foreigners on
waiting lists to enter as, e.g., the brothers and sisters of US citizens, or as
the married children of US citizens, could not immigrate under these
preferences, which would be eliminated.</tt><p>
<tt>The CIR also urged that efforts to integrate immigrants be stepped up by
making widely available English language instruction and civics
education.</tt><p>
<tt>If the CIR's recommendations are adopted, about 30 percent of the 1993
immigrants from the Dominican Republic, India, Jamaica, and Hong Kong would
have been excluded.  About 12 percent of Mexican immigrants would have been
excluded.</tt><p>
<tt>President Clinton and most major newspapers endorsed the CIR's
recommendations--Clinton called them pro-family and pro-work, and urged
Congress to consider the CIR's recommendations as a road map to revamp
immigration policy.</tt><p>
<tt>Critics complained that the CIR was blurring the distinction between legal
and illegal immigration.  House majority leader Dick Armey (R-TX) argued that
legal immigration is good for the US, and should be increased.  Senator Edward
Kennedy (D-MA) called the recommended cuts an unfair backlash in response to
California's Proposition 187.  Ethnic groups, churches, and some employers also
criticized the CIR's recommendations, accusing the CIR of bowing to
anti-immigrant pressures.  </tt><p>
<tt>Immigrants tend to be concentrated at the extremes of the education and
income spectrums--they are more likely than native-born residents to have not
completed high school or to have completed college or more--and that those at
the bottom of the US job ladder are depressing wages for immigrants as well as
natives, helping to explain why the gap between the earnings of college
graduates and high school dropout has risen by more than 50 percent over the
past 20 years.</tt><p>
<tt>The CIR recommended in September 1994 that efforts to prevent illegal
aliens form obtaining US jobs be stepped up, and that the US experiment with
computer methods for employers to check whether newly-hired workers were
authorized to work in the US.  In February 1995, President Clinton endorsed
this recommendation, and Congress is considering proposals to implement pilot
worker verification systems.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC4">Pros
and Cons of Guest
Workers</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a><a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></h2>
<tt>Economist Julian Simon, who has long advocated immigration as an economic
panacea, joined politicians such as Governor Wilson (R-CA) in arguing that the
US should re-create the "successful" bracero program that brought almost five
million Mexicans to US farm jobs between 1942 and 1964.  Some Mexicans returned
year after year, so only one to two million individuals participated.</tt><p>
<tt>Simon argued for a guest worker program under which foreign workers would
be permitted to remain in the US for three to five years, with priority given
to illegal alien workers already in the US.  Guest workers would be encouraged
to return to their countries of origin by wage and income tax deductions that
would be returned as departure bonuses.</tt><p>
<tt>According to Simon, the main obstacle to such a guest worker program is
"lack of a political constituency," meaning politically weak restaurant owners
and farmers. </tt><p>
<tt>California farmers developed a proposal in February 1995 to substitute an
attestation procedure for the current certification procedure through which
foreign farm workers are legally admitted if US workers are not available to
fill vacant US jobs.  Under attestation, the employer opens the door to foreign
workers, and the door remains open until there is a complaint and
administrative action closes the door.  Under certification, by contrast, the
door to foreign workers remains closed until the government takes action to
open it.</tt><p>
<tt>There is widespread opposition to calls for a new agricultural guest worker
program.  The CIR in June recommended against such a program: "a large scale
agricultural guest worker program...is not in the national interest...such a
program would be a grievous mistake."  The chairs of the Senate and House
immigration subcommittees, Simpson and Smith, have announced their
opposition.</tt><p>
<tt>On June 23, President Clinton issued a statement opposing an agricultural
guest worker program, asserting that a guest worker program would increase
illegal immigration, displace US workers, and depress wages and working
conditions.  Clinton said that "If our crackdown on illegal immigration
contributes to labor shortages.... I will direct the departments of Labor and
Agriculture to work cooperatively to improve and enhance existing programs to
meet the labor requirements of our vital agricultural industry consistent with
our obligations to American workers."</tt><p>
<tt>Clinton's statement highlights the difference between his view of opposing
guest workers to protect low-wage US workers and that of Wilson, a candidate
for the Republican presidential nomination, who proposes to admit guest
workers, implicitly agreeing with farmers who say that US workers will not do
farm work.  </tt><p>
<tt>Western growers attacked Clinton's statement, arguing that the
Administration should review it before dismissing their proposal.  The growers
proposal, reportedly contained in a 35-page bill that Senator Kyl (R-AZ) is
prepared to offer as an amendment to Simpson's immigration reform bill, would
permit employers to attest that they face labor shortages despite recruiting
workers at prevailing wages, to be recruited by associations, farmers or farm
labor contractors, and to be shifted from farm to farm as needed, and permit
foreign workers to remain in the US for up to 36 months.  Up to 30 percent of
each worker's wages could be withheld and sent to the US consulate nearest
their hometown for pickup, or forfeited by workers who failed to appear to
collect the withheld wages.</tt><p>
<tt>Fear that western growers may nonetheless succeed in winning a guest worker
program is based on their success in 1984-85.  Clinton's Chief of Staff Leo
Panetta, then in the House, and Governor Wilson, then a senator, successfully
made the arguments for agricultural guest workers over the strenuous objections
of the chairs of the immigration subcommittees.</tt><p>
<tt>The 1995 fight over farm workers is shaping up as a repeat of that of a
decade earlier.  It appears that Rep Gallegly (R-CA) and Kyl will play the
roles played by Panetta and Wilson in the mid-1980s.  Gallegly June 28 asserted
that 50 percent of California farm workers are illegal, and that California
growers need a guestworker program.</tt><p>
<tt>However, the mid-1980s argument that effective enforcement may lead to
labor shortages that must be met with special farm worker programs may not be
as credible in the mid-1990s, since there is already a certification program
through which farmers who cannot find US workers can request legal foreign
workers, and a history that includes worker abuse in agriculture may make it
hard to approve an attestation program that relies on self-enforcement.</tt><p>

Enters Phase
2</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>On June 23, the INS announced Phase Two of its effort to reduce illegal
immigration over the US border south of San Diego.  According to the INS,
Gatekeeper has made it more difficult for individual aliens to enter the US, so
they are responding by using smugglers, attempting entry further east, and
using false documents in an effort to enter the US through the port of
entry.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS will add agents to the border and staff at the ports of entry in a
stepped up effort to discourage illegal entries.  The US Attorney's Office
promised to charge smugglers and document forgers with felonies rather than
misdemeanors, meaning that those convicted could be sent to prison.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS will also keep open border checkpoints in San Clemente and
Temecula, which drew criticism from local officials.  Some local officials
claim the checkpoints do not halt illegal immigration, just divert it to the
canyons and fields of coastal and inland cities, where there are few border
agents.  The INS likes the checkpoints because it forces smugglers to stop
instead of making a straight run to Los Angeles.  </tt><p>
<tt>Since Operation Gatekeeper began, the INS raided 53 so-called "drop
houses," apprehending 2,500 migrants and 69 smugglers. </tt><p>
<tt>Operation Gatekeeper was launched October 1, 1994 to deter illegal entries
in the area with the most legal and illegal crossings--the 20-some miles of
border between San Diego and Tijuana.  After eight months, two facts are
clear--the number of persons apprehended along the southern border has
increased, but more aliens being apprehended in previously little-used crossing
areas, such as the easternmost sections of the San Diego area border, and in
Arizona.</tt><p>
<tt>Apprehension data are always hard to interpret.  Since Gatekeeper was
launched, there have been two other significant events--Mexico has slipped into
recession, and California added over 200,000 new jobs.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS has not released officially one indicator of which of these three
factors may be most important in explaining what is happening to illegal border
crossings-- the recidivism rate, or the number of illegal aliens who have been
apprehended several times (each alien apprehended is fingerprinted).
Unofficial reports are that about 30 percent of the 200,000 persons apprehended
and fingerprinted were caught before in the San Diego area.</tt><p>
<tt>Apprehensions in the westernmost sector--Imperial Beach--were down 52
percent in April compared to the same month last year.  Arrests in Chula Vista,
Brown Field and El Cajon--east of the port of entry--rose 34 percent, 126
percent and 824 percent, respectively, in April compared with the same period
last year.  The INS has added 53 agents to El Cajon to deal with the increase
of illegal entries. </tt><p>
<tt>These data can be interpreted to mean that Gatekeeper is having its
intended effect of discouraging illegal entries, or that the INS has not
altered the historical probability of being apprehended, which is about 30
percent.  If Gatekeeper is working, then the recidivism rate might be 100
percent--no one slips through--or 0, if aliens are so discouraged that only
first-timers make the attempt.  </tt><p>
<tt>If Gatekeeper has not changed the 30 percent probability of a typical
individual being apprehended, then it must be determined whether the number of
attempts and apprehensions would have been higher but for Gatekeeper, or
whether, despite the investment in better border controls, the INS has not
changed the probability of apprehension.</tt><p>
<tt>In a major three-part series, the Los Angeles Times on June 18-20 agreed
with the INS that there has not yet been a "tidal wave" of unauthorized Mexican
immigrants headed to the US.  The INS attributes the increased number of
apprehensions to the increased number of Border Patrol agents.  The Los Angeles
Times added Prop 187 and the feeling in Mexico that California is no longer a
economic and social beacon.  </tt><p>
<tt>Mexican researchers in Tijuana emphasize that the Gatekeeper has increased
the cost of waiting to cross the border, and the cost of coyotes, making it
harder for cash-strapped migrants to raise the $1,000 often needed to elude the
Border Patrol, get into the US, and find a job.  Once in the US, migrants
report increased difficulty finding jobs that offer steady work at more than
the minimum wage.</tt><p>
<tt>Most reports from Mexican villages and US work places suggest that
potential and actual illegal entrants are aware of Gatekeeper, but that most
believe they can still enter the US and find jobs.  There are reportedly an
increasing range of persons seeking US entry and jobs--well-educated teachers
and engineers, some who went into debt to buy houses and consumer goods in
anticipation of a continued economic boom, are reportedly joining small farmers
in the trek north.  Some of these better-educated Mexicans reportedly attempt
to enter the US through ports-of-entry with false documents.</tt><p>
<tt>In a profile of Jiquilpan, Michoacan, a township of 60,000 in western
Mexico that has traditionally sent migrants to the US, the Los Angeles Times
reports that the networks or settlement of anchor friends and relatives in the
US over the past 50 years enabled residents to think of the US labor market as
a safety valve.  However, solo male seasonal migration became family emigration
in the late 1980s, and the settlement of especially younger families in the US
helps to explain both the backlash in California over the costs of immigration,
and the fact that Mexican villages have disproportionately older
residents.</tt><p>
<tt>As in other countries with a tradition of seasonal and permanent migration
to the US, some in Jiquilpan complain that US culture and problems have invaded
rural Mexico, and some residents think that, in an environment in which drugs
and gangs have moved south, they may as well move north where at least
opportunities are better. </tt><p>
<tt>In Lennox near the Los Angeles International airport, residents who
originally came from Jiquilpan report that there are few jobs in nearby hotels
and restaurants for those who elude the Border Patrol.  The 25,000 residents
are 95 percent Latino, and many complain that there are so many workers looking
for jobs that many employers do not raise wages above the $4.25 hourly minimum,
and do require workers to accept split shifts and unpredictable hours.  Some
residents believe that stepped up border controls will encourage any
unauthorized migrants who succeed in making it to the US to settle here until
they obtain legal status.</tt><p>
<tt>Complaints about abuse by Border Patrol agents has increased.  There have
been as many reports of abuse in the first four months of 1995 as in all of
1994.  Human Rights Watch/Americas issued a report this month detailing a
"climate of impunity" along the border. </tt><p>
<tt>Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-CA) has introduced a bill that would require the INS
to build two more fences near the border, and station two Border Patrol agents
every 250 yards along this border. </tt><p>
<tt>On May 19, the INS reported that it broke a $12 million per year business
that supplied perhaps 10 to 20 percent of the counterfeit identification
produced for unauthorized aliens.  The business offered individuals the
identification needed to work "legally" for $120 to $180; this suggests monthly
sales of identification to about 6,700 persons.  The business operated from
vans in supermarket parking lots, with aliens dropping off pictures and money,
and receiving identification within one hour.</tt><p>
<tt>About 300 of the INS's 1,800 investigators enforce the employer sanctions
provisions of IRCA within the US; there are 5,000 Border Patrol officers to
deter illegal entry.  The INS will ask Congress to reduce from the current 29
to six the number of documents that can be provided to employers to verify
authorization to work--passports, Social Security cards, drivers licenses, INS
documents, and tribal documents.</tt><p>

 Scheduled</a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>A trial of the constitutionality of Proposition 187 is scheduled to begin
on September 5, 1995 in federal court in Los Angeles.  In May, California
succeeded in consolidating the various challenges to Prop 187, and putting them
on a fast track, so that the trial could start sooner.</tt><p>
<tt>The National Lawyers Guild announced plans to use volunteer lawyers and
students in California during the summer of 1995 to launch a "new civil rights
movement" to oppose Prop 187 and to preserve affirmative action.  A bill is
pending in Congress to enact a national version of Proposition 187.</tt><p>
<tt>Prop 187 is blamed or credited with re-opening debates over several
immigrant-related programs, including bi-lingual education.  Defenders of
teaching children in their native language, as mandated by the federal
Bilingual Education Act of 1967, see efforts to restructure immigrant
children's education as another example of immigrant bashing.  Supporters of
reform argue that, finally, parental pressure is challenging a flawed
concept.</tt><p>
<tt>California currently spends about $400 million annually "extra"--for
bonuses to teachers, aides, and materials-- to educate 1.2 million Limited
English Proficient pupils--one-third of all LEP students are in California.
Between 1981 and 1989, California required local school districts to teach LEP
students primarily in their own language.  The mandate has expired.</tt><p>
<tt>About 80 percent of the LEP students in California speak Spanish.  Even
though the number of LEP students doubled in the state, the number who
transition to all-English classes has remained at about 60,000 per year.  To
speed up the transition to English-only classes, California permits schools who
cannot find enough native language teachers to use English-as-a-
Second-Language (ESL) instruction.  ESL-taught students generally make the
transition to regular classes within three years.</tt><p>
<tt>Los Angeles Unified School District, with about half of California's LEP
students, in 1988 developed a master plan for bilingual education that mandates
native language instruction.  However, there are only 11,000 fully credentialed
bilingual teachers in California one for every 112 LEP students.  The number of
non-English-speaking students rose by 150 percent since 1985, while the number
of bilingual teachers increased by 30 percent.</tt><p>
<tt>It is hard to get agreement on which teaching strategy is best.  ESL
students score higher than other students on English tests, but native-language
students score better on standardized tests of subject matter.</tt><p>
<tt>On May 31, 1995, a California Court of Appeals ruled 3-0 that all
applicants for driver's licenses must provide Social Security Numbers.  The
ruling upholds state laws intended to prevent illegal aliens from obtaining
driver's licenses.</tt><p>
<tt>The California Civil Rights Initiative, which would end racial and ethnic
preferences in state university admissions and contracting, remains popular
with voters, even though it has not yet qualified for the ballot.  A June poll
found that 56 percent of those polled plan to vote for the CCRI.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC7">Detained
Aliens Riot</a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>In New Jersey, some of the 300 illegal aliens detained in a facility
operated for the INS by a private company, Esmor, attempted to take several
guards hostage to protest what they termed inadequate facilities.  All of those
detained had attempted to enter the US without documents, or with false
documents.  </tt><p>
<tt>On June 27, the INS announced that it was continuing its investigation of
Esmor.  The investigation was expected to completed by June 30, but as a result
of the disturbance the scope of the investigation is being broadened. </tt><p>
<tt>After the riot, all of the detained aliens were moved to county jails and
to other detention facilities, and local officials upset at poor management
threatened to prevent the jail's reopening.</tt><p>
<tt>Esmor is one of about 20 US companies that have profited from the
increasing number of aliens detained because it receives from the INS $75 to
$100 per detained alien per day.  Guards are paid about $8 to $9 per hour to
keep aliens in detention, and food was reportedly provided under a $1.12 per
person per day contract.</tt><p>
<tt>Esmor argued that the cause of the riot in New Jersey was the fact that
aliens were detained more than six months due to INS failures to process them
quickly, not conditions at the facility.  </tt><p>
<tt>The INS announced plans to begin random employer audits to check compliance
with the I-9 provisions of IRCA.  </tt><p>
<tt>In 1994, the INS opened 2,200 investigations of employers believed to be
hiring illegal aliens; 1,400 employers were assessed $11 million for
violations.</tt><p>

<tt>Ron Prince, a leader of the Proposition 187 campaign, is a backer of what
is being called Save Our State II -- an effort to amend the US Constitution to
end automatic citizenship for babies born on U.S. soil.  In 1991, 96,000 US
citizen babies were born to unauthorized mothers in California, including
29,000 in Los Angeles County.  </tt><p>
<tt>The 14th Amendment to the US Constitution, adopted after the Civil War in
1868, sought to clarify that the children of slaves were US citizens: "All
persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the
jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State
wherein they reside . . ."  The US Supreme Court has never faced the question
of whether babies born to unauthorized alien mothers should be entitled to US
citizenship.</tt><p>
<tt>There are two broad principles that govern birth citizenship--jus
sanguinis,  citizenship based on blood, and jus soli, citizenship based on the
soil where the baby is born.  The US and 12 other nations-- including Canada,
Spain, Venezuela and Ireland -- follow both principles, thereby granting
citizenship to people with either blood or soil ties to their countries.</tt><p>
<tt>There continues to be a lively discussion of the record number of
naturalization applications being filed by some of the 10 million aliens
eligible to become naturalized US citizens.  Applications for US citizenship
are up 80 percent in 1995 versus 1994, and up 500 percent in Los Angeles.  The
INS expects 725,000 naturalization applications in 1995, and 925,000 in
1996.</tt><p>
<tt>The consensus seems to be that the wave of naturalization applications<b>
</b>is due to a combination of the fact that three million legalized aliens
have become eligible to apply, that the INS required some of these aliens to
replace the green cards that demonstrate their immigrant status for a fee about
equal to the cost of naturalization, and that Prop 187 in California and
Congressional efforts to exclude non-US citizens from most federal welfare
programs illustrated as never before the benefits of US citizenship.</tt><p>
<tt>Interviews with applicants for naturalization in Los Angeles indicate that
personal reasons dominate:  such as<b> </b>a desire to join the California
Highway Patrol and ease of travel with a US passport.</tt><p>
<tt>The 1150 INS examiners handle over five million petitions annually for
items that range from work permits and green cards to naturalization.  Even
though aliens pay fees for these services, backlogs are mounting, and user fees
are piling up, because the INS has been under a hiring freeze.</tt><p>
<tt>Applicants for naturalization complete an INS N-400 form, pay a fee, and
then wait to be scheduled for an interview with an INS examiner.  After the
examiner certifies their knowledge of English and civics, naturalization
applicants take the oath of allegiance before a federal judge.</tt><p>
<tt>A survey that included 400 immigrants done for Fannie Mae found that 77
percent of those who are not yet US citizens would like to become citizens,
usually in order to vote.  Immigrants define integration in terms of obtaining
a college degree, getting involved in a child's school, and owning a
home.</tt><p>
<tt>Immigrants who rent are more likely than native-born renters to want to buy
a home--about three times more immigrant renters than all renters said that
their number one priority was to buy a home.  Some interpret the immigrant
desire for home ownership as a sign that immigrants are more likely than
natives to be optimistic about the American economy and its future.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC9">Mexican
</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>/a>President
Predicts Economic Growth</a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>President Zedillo, in his first major economic speech since the December
1994 peso crisis, predicted that after Mexico pulls out of its current
recession, it can grow annually at five percent.  </tt><p>
<tt>To raise revenue, the government in 1995 is planning its third major round
of privatization since the mid-1980s.  The first two privatization rounds
raised about $22 billion and, as part of the March 1995 bailout agreement,
Mexico promised to raise $12 to $14 billion in 1995 through the sale of
state-owned enterprises.</tt><p>
<tt>Privatization has a mixed record in Mexico.  The telephone monopoly was
simply transferred to private hands, and service failed to improve
significantly.  As smaller companies fail in the current round of bankruptcies
caused by recession and high interest rates, there is a risk that large
companies will swallow up their smaller competitors, increasing monopoly power
and inequality.</tt><p>
<tt>Foreign investors continue to invest in Mexico.  American companies that
reportedly doubled their long-term investments in Mexico to a cumulative $31
billion since 1991, and almost $9 billion in 1995, are cutting profit margins
and taking other steps to maintain market share despite Mexico's recession.
</tt><p>
<tt>Indians, who are about 10 percent of Mexico's 92 million people, are
reportedly being caught up in Mexico's drug wars.  The Indians in the Sierra
Madre mountains 250 miles south of El Paso reportedly hide marijuana and opium
poppy plants in their corn; drug violence in the region is increasing. </tt><p>
<tt>In FY94, about 660,000 Mexicans legally entered the US as non-immigrant
visitors, up 10 percent over FY93.  Almost 80 percent were
tourist/business/shopper visitors, who have B1/B2/BCC visas.  About 12,600 were
temporary workers or trainees, and 374 were NAFTA professionals--persons
permitted to enter the US to conduct NAFTA-related business here.</tt><p>
<tt>Formal negotiations for Chile's entrance to NAFTA began on June 7, 1995 in
Canada.  President Clinton has voiced support for fast-track legislation to
authorize Chile's accession to NAFTA by the end of 1995.  Labor and
environmental groups are pressing for side agreements.</tt><p>
<tt>Under NAFTA's environmental side agreement, the Montreal-based North
American Commission for Environmental Cooperation (NACEC) has agreed to
investigate the death of thousands of birds in the Mexican state of Guanajuato.
</tt><p>
<tt>Mexico's National Administrative Office (NAO), which investigates
complaints of violations of labor laws in the US, asked the US government to
investigate whether the US telephone company Sprint violated US labor laws when
it fired 177 Spanish-speaking employees in San Francisco in 1994.  The US NAO
concluded in April 1995 that Sony Mexico had mishandled the firing of 45
workers.</tt><p>
<tt>Since NAFTA went into effect on January 1, 1994, over 50,000 US workers
have filed petitions asserting that they lost their jobs because of imports
from Mexico or Canada, or because their US employers moved operations to one of
these countries.</tt><p>
<tt>In south Texas, where 1,400 so-called colonias have about 340,000
residents, many recent Mexican immigrants, developers will be required to
provide water and sewer connections before re-selling land for housing.  A 1989
law permitted developers who had already established sub-divisions to expand
them without providing sewer and water hookups, saddling Texas with an
infrastructure bill estimated at $1 billion or more. </tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC11">France:
Immigration and Local
Elections</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></h2>
<tt>The National Front, a party that seeks to stop immigration to France, won
control of three large French cities in municipal voting on June 18, including
Toulon, the country's largest Mediterranean port city.  National Front
candidates were also elected mayors of Orange and Marignagne, a suburb of
Marseilles.  During victory rallies, National Front leader Le Pen promised to
implement "national preference" and "the French come first" policies in
municipal jobs and subsidized housing.</tt><p>
<tt>Critics argued that national preference will slow the integration of
immigrants into French society.  Several called for boycotts of cities with
National Front mayors.</tt><p>
<tt>The German town of Ratstatt suspended links after 30 years with its French
sister city, Orange, after the election.  Rastatt's Social Democratic mayor
felt there was no way to work with the "inhumane policies" of the National
Front.  The Belgian city of Liege also  broke ties on June 20 with the French
city of Toulon. </tt><p>
<tt>In Dreux, a city of 37,000 west of Paris that is 28 percent immigrant, the
National Front's candidate for mayor used fear of immigration and crime to take
the lead in the race for mayor, but was not elected mayor.  Many of the
immigrants in Dreux were imported to fill jobs that have since disappeared, so
that unemployment among immigrant youth who live in the high-rise  apartments
around town is around 33 percent.</tt><p>
<tt>In the Paris suburb of Noisy-le-Grand, immigrant youth in early June went
on a rampage after a young Moroccan on a stolen motorbike crashed into traffic
lights attempting to elude police.  Most of the 57,000 residents are of North
African origin, and unemployment there exceeds the average rate of 12
percent.</tt><p>
<tt>When Romanian gypsies began to claim asylum in Lyon, anti-foreigner
sentiment reportedly rose.  Many gypsies went to Lyon under the mistaken
impression that the city would provide refuge.  The Socialist mayor in the city
of Saint-Priest, outside Lyon, resigned his job, claiming that the city was
overburdened with poor immigrants.  Nearly all the mainstream city council
members followed his example.  There are an estimated two million gypsies in
Romania, and many pay to be smuggled into Germany and France.  </tt><p>
<tt>On June 20, French police arrested 140 North Africans living in France who
were suspected of supporting groups seeking to overthrow the governments of
Algeria and Tunisia.</tt><p>
<tt>On June 22, the new French government announced that the minimum age would
be raised to $US 7.60 per hour, and that employers would not  have to pay
social security and health insurance taxes on workers paid less than $US 1,533F
per month.  These measures are intended to reduce the current 12.2 percent
unemployment rate.</tt><p>
<tt>The French government announced on June 12 that it may seek to extend the
trial phase for the Schengen accord, which abolished border controls among
seven EU member states.  France was expected to implement the Schengen accord
in March, 1995, but asked for a six month delay.  One reason for the delay is
the disagreement between France with her neighbors, Belgium and Germany, about
the right to pursue suspected offenders in a neighboring country and a clash
with the Dutch about drug controls and security at Amsterdam's Schipol Airport.

<tt>Unemployment in Germany fell below 3.5 million or to nine percent in May
1995, although the rate in the former East Germany remained above 13 percent.
In the east, there is disproportionately large employment in construction--15
percent of the work force--while in the west, there is a concentration of
employment in manufacturing--33 percent of the labor force.</tt><p>
<tt>In response to a June 15 protest by 6,000 construction workers in Berlin,
the German government agreed to consider a new law ensuring that foreign
workers are paid the same minimum wages on building sites as Germans.  The
construction workers protested the employment in Berlin of foreign
workers--most from other EU countries such as the UK--at wages less than
prevailing German wages.  </tt><p>
<tt>The bill will be considered by the Parliament in the fall and should become
law next year.  The law will remain in force for only two years and will apply
to workers employed directly in construction, but not those in related trades
such as electricians and painters.</tt><p>
<tt>Foreign construction workers are cheaper because employers do not have to
make German social welfare and health contributions on their behalf, and they
are not covered by German laws that regulate work hours, severance pay, or
minimum wages. According to one employer calculation, the total cost of
employing a German construction worker is $57 per hour, about four times the
cost of a Portuguese worker. </tt><p>
<tt>Germany on August 1, 1994 allowed private employment agencies for the first
time to place all kinds of workers in permanent jobs--previously, private
employment agencies could only match managerial or professional persons such as
models with jobs, and place unskilled workers in temporary jobs.  By May 1995,
some 2,200 private employment agencies had been certified to operate in
competition with the public Employment Service, but they made only 3,000
placements between August and December 1994, far less than the pace needed to
make the projected 100,000 placements in their first year.</tt><p>
<tt>During the first five months of 1995, almost 50,000 foreigners applied for
asylum in Germany.  Almost half of the 9,400 applications in May 1995 were from
ex-Yugoslavia and Turkey.</tt><p>
<tt>Some 200 churches have begun to shelter some rejected asylum seekers in an
effort to prevent their deportation.  Reportedly, 2,000 asylum seekers have
sought asylum in churches since 1984.</tt><p>
<tt>There are between 60,000 and 100,000 Vietnamese living in Germany.
Vietnamese who are denied work permits allegedly support themselves by selling
contraband cigarettes on street corners in Berlin and other German cities.
Fighting over the cigarette trade has led to the death of 19 people in Berlin.
There have also been claims that the police are targeting foreigners for
beatings.</tt><p>
<tt>This summer, Germany will deport<b> </b>the first 2,500 of<b> </b>40,000<b>
</b>Vietnamese<b> </b>who applied for asylum and were refused, and those who
entered, sometimes illegally, into Germany in the early 1990s.  More than
50,000 Vietnamese accepted $2,000 bonuses in 1990-91 and left for
Vietnam.</tt><p>
<tt>Under the agreement between Hanoi and Bonn, Vietnam will accept the 40,000
undocumented Vietnamese by the year 2000 and Bonn will pay Hanoi at least $72
million to assist with their repatriation.  During the two-year negotiations,
the primary stumbling block was how much money Bonn would have to pay Vietnam
to take back the illegal immigrants as soon as possible. </tt><p>
<tt>The 40,000 Vietnamese scheduled for deportation were among the 100,000 who
once resided in East  Germany.  Local officials and judges have granted either
permanent residence permits or "tolerance papers" to about 60,000 allowing them
to stay and work in the reunified Germany.</tt><p>
<tt>Some German legislators, including the government's special representative
for the affairs of alien residents, favor granting residency to the Vietnamese
on political and humanitarian grounds. </tt><p>
<tt>Eastern Europe is expecting many of the Vietnamese to flee there instead of
waiting for repatriation to Vietnam.  Eastern European government officials are
especially concerned about criminals, such as the Vietnamese mafia, that may
enter their countries. </tt><p>
<tt>A Czech Republic diplomat said that Vietnamese are already starting to
cross from Germany to the Czech Republic, where Vietnamese are believed to be
two percent of the total illegal immigrant population.  Poles report that it
only costs a few hundred dollars to illegally cross the German-Polish border.

</a></h2>
<tt>The UK is considering following the lead of the Netherlands, Germany,
Norway and Spain and detaining applicants for asylum in obsolete military
installations.  Asylum applicants currently get housing and food benefits of
about L100 per week($160).  Instead of cash payments, in the future they would
be provided these benefits in the camps.</tt><p>
<tt>It is hoped that the camps will save money and deter illegal immigration,
since some applicants currently disappear into the UK.   The UK may imitate
France and declare asylum camps to be extra-territorial in order to limit the
appeal rights of residents.</tt><p>
<tt>There were a record 32,821 asylum applications in the UK in 1994, and there
is a backlog of 55,000 applications.  About 90 percent of asylum applications
are rejected after an average 32 weeks.</tt><p>
<tt>The UK is also considering tightening rules on marriages to persons seeking
to immigrate. So-called marriages of convenience can be arranged for L1,000
despite rules that make foreigners who enter the UK to join spouses
probationary immigrants for 12 months.  Some immigration officials report that
spouses interviewed sometimes have trouble remembering and pronouncing each
others' names.</tt><p>
<tt>In 1993, there were that 19,000 immigrants admitted to the UK as a wife,
husband or fianc&eacute;(e).  Another 17,000 came to Britain for some other
reason, and then announced plans to marry.</tt><p>
<tt>Britain's first Asian Bishop, who was born in Pakistan, urged the UK to
open itself to immigration to attract needed skills.  The Bishop urged the UK
to follow the lead of the US and Canada and plan for the annual admission of
family and economically-useful immigrants.</tt><p>
<tt>Some 1,700 aliens were detected attempting to enter the UK clandestinely in
1994.  Police in Scotland in mid-June raided homes and workplaces in their
search for an estimated 4,000 mostly Asian illegal immigrants.</tt><p>
<tt>Also in June, youths went on a rampage in Manningham, breaking shop
windows.  This prompted a round of soul-searching that concluded that the Asian
Muslim working class has been left behind by economic growth, and is
increasingly frustrated.</tt><p>
<tt>Two police officers accused of killing an illegal Jamaican who was being
forcibly returned to Jamaica in July 1993 were cleared in June 1995.  The
20-year old woman arrived in Britain on a tourist visa to visit her mother, and
then married a 57-year old man whom she reportedly beat.  He had her barred
from his home after 10 weeks, which made her an illegal immigrant in the UK.
After failing to leave as required by several deportation orders, she was
picked up by British police.  There were many editorials in British papers
condemning the verdict and calling for better treatment of immigrants. </tt><p>
<tt>A UK quarry hired 12 French workers when, despite 16,480 unemployed workers
in Northleach, no British workers applied for the L4($6.50) per hour jobs.
British employers complain of "a mismatch between what people expect and what
is available."</tt><p>

Top Europe's Migrants</a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>A new report by the UN's Economic Commission for Europe found that Russians
top the list of recently displaced persons and migrants.  The report says that
although the number of refugees, displaced persons and other victims of
military conflicts in Europe as a whole has dropped, in Russia the inflow of
immigrants in the second half of last year rose by 39 per cent.  </tt><p>
<tt>The overall increase in the Russian population in 1994 was 810,000, nearly
double 1993.</tt><p>
<tt>The report cites armed conflicts as one of the reasons behind high levels
of population mobility in the former USSR.  Other contributing factors are the
change in the status of a large number of ethnic Slavs in non-Slav countries,
where they are subjected to discrimination, the continuing economic crisis, and
varying standards of living in the countries of the former USSR.</tt><p>
<tt>Non-Estonians who wish to live in Estonia must apply for a residence permit
by July 12, 1995, and as of early June, about 60 percent or 238,000 mostly
Russians had applied.</tt><p>
<tt>About 650,000 Jews from the former Soviet Union have arrived in Israel
since September 1989.  It is reported that hundreds of people in the ex-USSR
are purchasing documents that enable them to pass themselves off as Jews and
win the right to emigrate to Israel.  The going price for such documents is
reportedly $800 per person.</tt><p>
<tt>Former Israeli defense minister Ariel Sharon in a June 23 editorial, called
on Israelis not to create a separate Russian party in Israel, because it will
not improve the situation of Russian immigrants in Israel.  Sharon said the
country is too focused on the Arab issue to make aliya a priority.</tt><p>

Smuggling</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></h2>
<tt>Smugglers are increasingly abandoning Africans and Asians who have paid
$1,000 or more to be smuggled to Western Europe in Eastern Europe.  In several
cases, aliens were told that they were in Italy, when they were actually in
Croatia, or told they were in Germany but were actually in Hungary.</tt><p>
<tt>Some Asian restaurants established by ex-guest workers have become
smuggling fronts.  In Prague, one Chinese restaurant in Prague reportedly has
800 employees and eight tables.</tt><p>
<tt>Aliens sometimes try to enter a country as members or sponsors of sports
teams.  The International Center for Migration Policy Development in Vienna
calculated that alien smugglers in Europe grossed between $100 million and $1.1
billion in 1993; other estimates put annual receipts at $7 billion
annually.</tt><p>
<tt>When these aliens apply for asylum, most are housed in camps in Eastern
Europe that are often run with EU aid.  Some 20,000 aliens have passed through
the Kistarcsa camp outside Budapest since 1990.</tt><p>
<tt>EU aid funds can be used to fight drug smuggling, but not migrant
smuggling.  The major control device developed by western European governments
are bilateral agreements with the countries of transit that require aliens
transiting through e.g. Poland to Germany to be returned to Poland.  Some human
rights groups argue that Eastern European governments do not have the
infrastructure to accurately determine who is a refugee.</tt><p>
<tt>The International Organization of Migration (IOM) reported June 16 that
young women from eastern and central European are migrating to western Europe
in large numbers as prostitutes, that prosecution of smugglers and pimps
sentences was difficult, and that sentences for those convicted were light.
The four major countries of origin for these prostitutes are the Czech Republic
and Poland, while Russia and Ukraine.</tt><p>
<tt>There were a net 1.2 million immigrants arriving in the 15 EU counties in
1992, primarily from the former Yugoslavia, the former Soviet Union, Poland and
Romania.  </tt><p>
<tt>Concerned with the influx of immigrants from its southern flank, the
European Union agreed on June 27 to spend $6.1 billion over the next five years
to stabilize the economies of the EU's southern neighbors.  EU leaders also
called for more progress in negotiating trade agreements with Morocco, Israel,
Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria. </tt><p>
<tt>France has used its six month's as the EU's rotating president to bring
Mediterranean issues to forefront.  Spain takes over the EU presidency on July
1 and is expected to continue pushing for firm links with its Mediterranean
neighbors.  An EU-Mediterranean conference will be held in Barcelona in
November. </tt><p>
<tt>Following an accident that left him 80 percent disabled, a Turkish driver
who worked for several years in the Netherlands has been ordered home by the
European Union Court of Justice.  The court ruled that since he is no longer
able to hold a job in the Netherlands, Dutch authorities are not obligated to
provide him with a residence permit.  The court made the same ruling in the
case of retired workers.</tt><p>

<tt>Turkey is attracting immigrants from the Middle East, North Africa, the
former Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc nations, Bulgaria, Romania and Poland.
Official data put the number of foreign residents in Turkey at 72,905. </tt><p>
<tt>A study by the Center for Turkish Studies in Essen, found that while
official data indicate that 1,861 Iraqi and 4,234 Iranian migrants were
registered as immigrants in Turkey since the Iran-Iraq war in 1991,  there are
5,000 Iraqis in Istanbul alone, and over 200,000 Iranians in Turkey.  Official
data indicate 68 Algerian residents in Turkey but, in 1994 some 22,000
Algerians entered Turkey as tourists, and only 21,000 were recorded as having
left the country.</tt><p>
<tt>United Nations agencies put the numbers of Bosnian migrants in Turkey
following the disintegration of Yugoslavia at 15,000, and the number of
Abkhazians escaping civil war in Georgia at 30,000.</tt><p>
<tt>Turkey does not impose visa restrictions on Romanians, Croatians, Albanians
and Macedonians.  Other former East Bloc nationals enter the country on
three-month tourist visas; some stay on to seek employment, often illegally.
</tt><p>
<tt>Turkey, the fastest growing member of the OECD in the mid-1980s, is
floundering economically.  Exports totaled $41 billion in 1994, excluding an
estimated $4 billion in "unofficial" Turkish exports to the ex-USSR that are
carried by women who engage in "luggage trade," arriving in Istanbul with
suitcases stuffed with cheap Russian goods, and leaving with textile and
leather goods from Turkey.</tt><p>
<tt>Turkey has been trying for a decade to be welcomed into the European Union,
but its human rights record may prevent EU approval of a customs union
scheduled to go into effect on January 1, 1996.  The European Parliament has
threatened to withhold its approval of the customs union unless Turkey's human
rights record improves by October 1995.</tt><p>
<tt>Article 8 of Turkey's anti-terrorism law forbids any verbal or written
threats to Turkey's territorial integrity.  This law is used to prosecute
Turkish separatists and their sympathizers, and those charged are tried in
semi-military courts.</tt><p>

<tt>Some of the 40,000 Vietnamese boat people who are still in camps in Hong
Kong, Thailand, Indonesia, and Malaysia are rioting to protest plans to return
them by force if necessary to Vietnam in 1995.  </tt><p>
<tt>The US has endorsed the Comprehensive Plan of Action, the plan to return
the Vietnamese, but Republicans in Congress introduced legislation in the
Foreign Aid bill to stop forced returns and to offer up $30 million to 20,000
of the Vietnamese in the camps visas to enter the US.  The House approved the
bill on June 8.  The Senate has not acted upon the bill and President Clinton
has announced his opposition to the measure.<b></b></tt><p>
<tt><b></b>The UNHCR and Asian governments say that the House action is
responsible for the refusal of Vietnamese to return voluntarily.  Some
Vietnamese told refugee counselors that they did not want to return to Vietnam
and would await the final outcome of the US legislation.  The US sent leaflets
distributed to the refugees in Hong Kong and other Asian countries by the UNHCR
to urge them to return home.</tt><p>
<tt>Malaysian and United Nations officials have halted talks about the 4,000
refugees who refuse to return to Vietnam.  On June 5, more than 4,000
Vietnamese refugees, some armed with knives and sticks, tore down a section of
the fence that surrounds the Sungai Besi transit camp on the outskirts of the
Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur.  The refugees crossed a major highway to
protest their repatriation following Malaysia's decision to close the camp by
Aug. 31.  There has been some discussion by Malaysian government officials of
keeping the camp open past the August deadline for mandatory repatriation.
</tt><p>
<tt>On June 8, police used tear gas to stop an eight-hour protest by Vietnamese
refugees at the High Island detention center in Hong Kong.  The violence
started when police tried to move 94 Vietnamese from the center to another site
prior to repatriation. </tt><p>
<tt>In the aftermath of the riots, the Hong Kong government put on hold the
removal of any Vietnamese from detention centers while it reconsiders its
repatriation policy.  Plans to move 100 people from the High Island camp in
late June have been canceled until at least the end of July. </tt><p>
<tt>Nearly 1,000 Vietnamese have been returned voluntarily from Hong Kong so
far this year. There are still about 500 migrants still in detention centers
who refuse to be repatriated to Vietnam.</tt><p>
<tt>Chinese asylum-seekers stormed a West Australian detention center, injuring
four security officers, on June 11.  The reason for the fighting was unclear,
but seemed to center around two boat people who arrived in Australia in the
same boat. </tt><p>
<tt>Vietnam has exported 14,000 workers since the first 811 workers were sent
abroad in 1992, according to the Labor Ministry.  The major countries of
employment for Vietnamese guest workers are South Korea, Hong Kong, Japan,
Malaysia, Lebanon and Libya.  These data exclude the guest workers sent to
Eastern Europe before 1989.</tt><p>
<tt>Vietnam is hoping to increase its labor exports; 37 of Vietnam's state
enterprises are authorized to send their workers overseas.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC19">Philippine</a>s
Approves New Migrant Worker
Act</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>On June 7, Philippines President Fidel Ramos signed into law the Migrant
Workers and Overseas Act.  The new law calls for stricter monitoring of the
policies of labor importing countries to ensure that they have adequate laws to
protect migrant workers.  The bill also tightens regulations on the recruitment
of labor in the Philippines and requires workers to register with Philippine
embassies overseas.</tt><p>
<tt>It is not clear how effective the new law will be.  Nearly half of the
estimated 4 million Philippines' overseas workers are illegal, since they leave
for overseas jobs without the proper documentation.  Many may fail to register
with Filipino authorities abroad.</tt><p>
<tt>The Philippine Labor Department has begun to station agents at Manila's
airport to detect Filipino workers who are attempting to go abroad illegally
for employment.  Many Filipinos go as tourists to third-country destinations,
and then travel to the country in which they hope to work.</tt><p>
<tt>In a related action, the Philippine Senate ratified the UN Convention on
Migrant Workers.  The Philippines signed the convention in 1993, and completed
the ratification process the last week of May, 1995.  Sixteen more countries
need to ratify the convention before it comes into force. </tt><p>
<tt>An advisory commission appointed by President Ramos after a Filipina maid
was hanged by Singapore in March (April MN) recommended that the Philippines
stop the export of maids to "certain Middle Eastern and Asian nations." The
commission is now on a 15-nation tour to investigate the problems of Philippine
overseas workers.</tt><p>
<tt>In 1994, an estimated 5,000 Filipina maids left the Gulf states complaining
of employer abuse. The commission asked the government to start blacklisting
employers who mistreat overseas workers.  </tt><p>
<tt>The Philippine Overseas Workers Welfare Administration reported receiving
more than 10,000 complaints from overseas workers last year, including 156
cases of physical mistreatment and 18 rapes in Kuwait, 32 physical abuse cases
and 11 rapes in Saudi Arabia and 33 cases of mistreatment and six rapes in
Oman.</tt><p>
<tt>Since April 1995, state-owned Kuwaiti airlines returned at no charge
Filipina maids who charge that they were abused by their Kuwaiti employers.
There are about 20,000 Filipina maids in Kuwait, and 20 left in April, 54 in
early June, and 44 in late June.</tt><p>
<tt>There are an estimated four million Filipinos working abroad, including
perhaps 800,000 women, and 600,000 in the Gulf states.</tt><p>
<tt>With the government discouraging overseas workers, remittances from
overseas workers, a major boost to the economy, are expected to decline.  The
Philippine government hopes to offset the decline in remittances with foreign
investment in the Philippines.  A Philippine political strategist predicts that
it will take three to five years for a shift in the labor deployment rate to be
evident. </tt><p>
<tt>Data showed that during the years when the Philippine economy was
experiencing a downturn, income from migrant workers kept the country's economy
afloat.  Income from abroad increased by 16 per cent, from 7.1 billion pesos in
the first quarter of 1994, to 8.2 billion pesos in early 1995.</tt><p>
<tt>The Philippines has launched an amnesty program for illegal aliens who
entered the country before June 20, 1992.  Under the program, illegal aliens
can pay about $10,000 and receive a permanent resident status.  The Philippines
hopes to earn $39 million from the legalization program, suggesting that 40
percent of the estimated 100,000 illegal aliens in the country will legalize
their status.  Most of the first applicants have been from China and
Taiwan.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC20">Countries
Lure Hong </a></a></a></a></a></a>Kong Migrants</a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>Singapore and Taiwan are trying to lure Hong Kong residents who want to
leave the territory prior to 1997.  </tt><p>
<tt>Singapore is running a series of commercials in Hong Kong that show happy
young families enjoying the tropical oasis.  The series is designed to  attract
wealthy Hong Kong residents to the Singapore.  The Singapore government is
confident that its strong educational system will attract Hong Kong residents.
</tt><p>
<tt>There is speculation that Singapore would like the Hong Kong residents to
settle in Singapore because its own affluent and well-educated Chinese
population is having fewer children. Singapore has almost no unemployment.
</tt><p>
<tt>Some Hong Kong residents are reluctant to settle in a city-state considered
dull and tough on law and order.  Of the 40,000 immigration applications
accepted by the Singapore government, only 6,500 have taken up residency in
Singapore. </tt><p>
<tt>Singapore allows qualified Hong Kongers to wait five years before they must
physically migrate, which may account for the low residency rate.  The
government also offers residency to the parents of Hong Kong students studying
in Singapore.</tt><p>
<tt>In a bid to attract more Hong Kong investors prior to 1997, Taiwan has
relaxed its immigration restrictions, reducing in half the required investment
rate.  Ronald Skeldon, a Hong Kong University geography professor, says that
Hong Kong residents prefer Canada to Taiwan.  </tt><p>
<tt>Between 1,000 to 3,500 Hong Kong people settle in Taiwan each year, many
applying on the basis of family reunification. </tt><p>
<tt>Many Hong Kong residents are applying to migrate to several countries, such
as the United States, Britain, Canada, Australia, in addition to Singapore and
Taiwan.  Because these Hong Kong migrants are well-off, they will see which
countries accept them before making a decision.  Canada continues to be the
favorite destination, with more than 40,000 new arrivals from Hong Kong.
</tt><p>
<tt>Australia reports that the number of Hong Kong-born people in the country
doubled between 1985 and 1991.  Australia is now has the second largest source
of Hong Kong emigrants, after Britain.  </tt><p>
<tt>According to a 1991 census, of the 278,000 people who left Hong Kong for
Canada, the United States and Australia between 1985 and 1991, more than a
quarter settled in Australia.  There were 57,510 Hong Kong-born residents in
Australia at the time of the 1991 Census, up from 28,293 in 1986 and 15,717 in
1981.</tt><p>

<tt>A labor summit on June 6 in Hong Kong with government officials, employers,
labor leaders and legislators was unable to agree upon the issue of labor
importation into the territory.  Governor Chris Patten said that there are
sharp differences on how the hiring of foreign workers affects the unemployment
rate in Hong Kong.  He is considering establishing a tripartite committee with
representatives of government, employers and labor to manage the labor
importation plan which is now run solely by the government.  </tt><p>
<tt>A 13-point plan was presented during the summit which included stepping up
retraining, doubling the immigration task force to 100 to deal with illegal
immigrants, and stiffer action against illegal workers. </tt><p>
<tt>The unemployment issue has united the pro-Beijing and liberal camps here,
which organized signature campaigns as well as a noisy mass protest outside the

<tt>Hong Kong currently allows a maximum of 25,000 semi-skilled foreign workers
into the territory at any time.  This excludes the 120,000 foreign domestic
workers, and thousands of foreign construction workers at the Chek Lap Kok
airport site. </tt><p>
<tt>Hong Kong's unemployment rate jumped to a nine-year high of three percent
in the second quarter of 1995, prompting union leaders to press for an end to
the employment of foreign workers. The government says the actual number of
imported workers is less than one-third the number of unemployed locals.  An
estimated 78,000 Hong Kong residents were unemployed in the first quarter of
1995.</tt><p>
<tt>Hong Kong has quotas for various types of foreign workers:  foreign
professionals are not restricted by quota, but there is a limit of 25,000
semi-skilled workers, and 17,000 construction workers.  In addition, there are
about 120,000 domestic foreign workers in Hong Kong.  Unions claim that, with
illegal workers, there are a total of 300,000 foreign workers in Hong
Kong.</tt><p>
<tt>In 1989, Hong Kong upped the foreign worker quotas to keep the territory
competitive, but so many factory jobs have moved to southwestern China that
unemployment among garment and other manufacturing workers is reported to be
almost 10 percent.  Hong Kong employers have permitted workers imported for one
purpose, for example as maids and gardeners, are being used in other jobs, as
drivers or street sales persons, or even factory workers.</tt><p>
<tt>Patten announced that illegal foreign workers will be the target of 92
inspectors of the Immigration Department in order to create jobs for unemployed
local workers.  During the first 24-hour period on June 16-17, 88 illegal
immigrants were arrested during a territory-wide sweep. </tt><p>
<tt>Illegal foreign workers can be fined $5,000 and jailed for two years.  In
1994, 919 Hong Kong employers, and 2,906 foreign workers, were fined.
Increased employer penalties are expected to be announced by the government
this year. </tt><p>
<tt>The daily quota for the number of Chinese allowed to immigrate to Hong Kong
will be raised on July 1, 1995 from 105 to 150.  Most of the additional
immigration slots are reserved for children who are not of school age, i.e.,
those less than five and 16 to 21, to minimize pressures on Hong Kong
schools.</tt><p>
<tt>After July 1, 1997, a Chinese person born outside Hong Kong can reside in
Hong Kong if one of his or her parents was a Hong Kong resident at birth.
There are believed to be 64,000 such children in China.</tt><p>

<tt>There are an estimated 300,000 illegal migrant workers in Japan, prompting
a study of how to provide them with health care.  A panel convened by the
Ministry of Health and Welfare recommended that employers and permanent foreign
workers share the cost of health insurance premiums on a 50-50 basis, but did
not say exactly how illegal workers would be covered.  This is a policy shift
for the Health and Welfare Ministry, who had previously insisted that health
insurance coverage for illegal workers would encourage them to stay. </tt><p>
<tt>The Japanese Supreme Court asked lower courts to translate written
indictments for foreign defendants into languages they can understand.  The
court hopes that this will help protect the human rights of foreign criminal
defendants, who are increasing in number.  Foreigners are 4 percent of those
arrested for criminal offenses. </tt><p>
<tt>In 1994, over 65,000 foreigners were deported from Japan, a seven percent
decrease over 1993.  The Japanese government attributed the decline to a
recession and tighter control over illegal workers. </tt><p>
<tt>Of the 59,352 foreigners found to be working illegally in 1994, 17,130 were
South Korean, followed by nationals of Thailand, Malaysia, China, Iran and
other Southeast Asian countries.  Illegal workers from China, Peru and Burma
rose most sharply.  The most common type of jobs held by illegal workers were
construction, factory or entertainment. </tt><p>

<tt>There are estimated to be 80 to 100 million migrant workers within China,
and the disruptions associated with migration are showing up in broken families
and rising crime.  Migrants living under bridges sometimes rob local residents,
and are victims of robbery.  </tt><p>
<tt>Police who arrest migrants for vagrancy know that many will be sentenced to
produce goods for three to six months in prison factories.  The Chinese
government is considering holding a national conference on its new efforts to

<tt>The "floating population," as the Chinese government refers to migrants,
has affected economic development and social stability.  According to a
government spokesperson, the Chinese plan to strengthen registration and public
security control. </tt><p>
<tt>The increased number of rural Chinese migrants, many of whom belong to
minority groups, has heightened awareness of their cultural differences and
economic disadvantages.  The government has launched an affirmative action
plan: exempting minorities from the strictures of the one-child birth control
policy and allowing them to have three or more children, opening up new
educational opportunities for them and providing better access to government
jobs.  Between 1982 and 1990, the minority population grew by more than 35
percent to 91.2 million. </tt><p>
<tt>Guandong Province has emerged as a safe haven for people fleeing poverty
and forced birth control of the Jiangxi Province.  Migrants often live on boats
to evade census registration, with three or four children earning a living
fishing.  In northern Hunan, local government officials have started posting
warnings that boat people on Dongting Lake must report four times per year to
local clinics for pregnancy checks or face steep fines. </tt><p>
<tt>These internal Chinese boat people tell stories of those found without
census or marriage cards having their boats destroyed or confiscated.  Others
tell of family planning officials threatening to blow up houses if the women
did not submit to sterilization.</tt><p>
<tt>On June 13, the Chinese government announced that it would reinforce its
controls to halt illegal immigration, especially into the southern regions of
the country.  More than 20,000 foreigners enter China illegally every year,
mostly from Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia, plus a small number of illegal
immigrants from Africa and Russia.  In the past year, police detained 12,000
illegal immigrants in the Yunnan province and the autonomous region of Guangxi.

<tt>Malaysia's Human Resources Ministry in June outlined strategies to increase
the supply of local workers and to reduce dependence on foreign workers.
</tt><p>
<tt>Malaysia has an unemployment rate of less than three percent, and a recent
poll of 150 local, foreign and joint-venture companies reported that 62 percent
of the foreign firms in Malaysia face labor shortages, but only 28 percent
considered the problem serious.  One-third of the foreign and joint-venture
companies might shift some of their operations to other countries if labor
shortages continue.</tt><p>
<tt>Thirty-three percent of the companies in the manufacturing sector indicated
a need for the government to play a greater role in upgrading training,
productivity and setting up vocational institutes, and 28 per cent wanted a
relaxation of the restrictions governing the importation of foreign
labor.</tt><p>
<tt>Many of the electrical and electronics foreign firms in Malaysia recommend
that the government legalize illegal foreign workers in the country to
alleviate the labor shortage.  </tt><p>
<tt>When the government recently raided Bangladeshi housing areas, there were
reported to be shortages of gas station attendants.  Tighter restrictions on
Indonesian migration reportedly led to farm labor shortages.</tt><p>
<tt>There are reportedly 850,000 legal foreign workers in Malaysia, including
100,000 maids, and 400,000 illegal foreign workers.</tt><p>
<tt>Instead of hiring more foreign workers, Malaysia would like to raise the 47
percent female labor force participation rate, to increase the number of part
time jobs, and to make unemployed workers in depressed regions more mobile, so
that they could move to where jobs are.  In addition, the Malaysian
government's Seventh Plan (1996-2000) provides M$1 billion to build seven more
training centers which are expected to add 10,000 skilled workers
annually.</tt><p>
<tt>Malaysian trade unions note that several hundred thousand Malaysians
migrate overseas for jobs, and that the solution to the labor shortage is to
raise wages.  In southern Malaysia, Malaysians commute to jobs in Singapore,
while foreign workers fill in behind them in Malaysia.</tt><p>
<tt>Foreign workers who change jobs in Malaysia can be charged up to $US122,
while employers who hire illegal foreign workers can be fined up to $US 4,098,
plus face five years imprisonment.  Some foreigners reportedly enter Malaysia
as maids, and then go to work in higher-wage restaurants, grocery stores, and
offices.</tt><p>
<tt>Malaysia and the Philippines agreed to develop an identification system for
legal Filipino workers.  The Philippine government estimates that there are
four to six million Filipinos in 130 countries, and new laws grant these
overseas Filipinos new tax exemptions and protections.</tt><p>
<tt>The Philippine government asked Malaysia to grant partial amnesty for its
illegal workers in the country so that they could be properly registered.  The
Philippine government said it will welcome back any illegal workers who wish to
return home. </tt><p>
<tt>The Maybank of Malaysia, Philippine National Bank and Indonesia's Lippobank
have implemented a joint electronic remittance system.  The system enables
Indonesian workers in Malaysia to remit money for a $4 fee at any of the
Maybank branches, to be collected at any Lippobank branch in Indonesia. </tt><p>
<tt>The three banks hope that the new system will funnel the money away from
unregulated couriers, who sometimes charge high fees and use arbitrary exchange
rates. </tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC27">Australia
Raises Immigrant Quota</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>Australia announced an increase of 6,500 for FY 95-96 in the family and
skills categories. They is also an increase of 500 for business migrants and
3,000 in the special category for Chinese nationals who were allowed to stay in
Australia after the Tiananmen Square massacre. </tt><p>
<tt>The immigration minister had asked the Australian Cabinet for an increase
of 10,000 immigrants, but was turned down of because of the potential impacts
on the labor market.  According the immigration minister, the increase in
business migrants reflects the "internationalization of the economy," and
Australia's needs to take advantage of resources, skills and networks of
business migrants. </tt><p>
<tt>The government will plan to accept 83,000 migrants in 1995-96 compared with
76,500 places in FY 94-95.  The increase is restricted to the family reunion
(51,000 in total), skilled migration (30,800) and special eligibility (1200)
categories.  There will be no increase in 1994's 13,000 slots for
refugees.</tt><p>
<tt>A Bureau of Immigration, Multicultural and Population Research report says
that the number of new immigrants to Sydney has jumped from 38 percent of the
total intake in 1984-85 to 44 percent in 1993-94.  The next most popular
destination for new immigrants in Victoria, with 23 percent of new arrivals.
Up to half of the immigrants who arrived in Sydney were not in the workforce in
1993-94; of those eligible to work, 11 percent did not have a job. </tt><p>
<tt>The Australian government has raised the visa application fees from A$400
to $550, and from A$1,715 to $2,430 for business migrants.  This will earn the
government an extra A$13 million.  The government also approved an increase in
spending for migrant services of $40 million. </tt><p>
<tt>The Australian Opposition claim that the government has "unleashed an
unprecedented attack" on migrant communities.  The opposition claims the
government does not provide equitable access to services for ethnic
communities, and that cuts in health and education have augmented the problems.
</tt><p>
<tt>An Opposition White Paper further claims that Australia's industrial
relations policies leave immigrant workers vulnerable to exploitation.  The
opposition called on the ethnic communities to comment on the paper by August
18, so that a new policy could be considered at the ALP state conference in
October, 1995. </tt><p>

<tt>There are believed to be 55 million child laborers in India today, and a
projected 70 million in the year 2000.  The ILO estimates that there are 200
million children ages 10 to 14 employed world wide, making children almost 10
percent of the world's 2.5 billion workers.</tt><p>
<tt>One reason why the number of children working in carpet, match, and other
factories in India is expected to increase is because India recently changed
economic policies to stress exports.  The largest single employer of children
in India is agriculture, where an estimated 25 million are employed, and the
second largest employer of Indian children are services that range from hotels
to household maids.  But there are also believed to be over five million Indian
children employed in labor intensive industries that range from carpet weaving
to cutting gems to making soccer balls.  </tt><p>
<tt>Families in areas such as Bihar, where incomes average less than $100
annually and seasonal migration to stone quarries and brick kilns is common,
sending children to make carpets in the shade is considered better by some
families than to have them crushing rocks in the sun.  In response to action
against child labor, carpet makers have begun to use subcontractors to produce
carpets in remote villages.  The Indian government's Rugmark program, which
certifies that children were not employed to make carpets, has three inspectors
to keep children away from looms in 2,000 villages, many inaccessible by
auto.</tt><p>
<tt>Child labor, and migrant child labor, raises questions about how far
governments and international organizations should go to intervene in
situations in which families look to children to provide up to one-third of
family income.</tt><p>
<tt>The Indian Commission on Labour Standards concluded that industrialized
countries should help fund the cost of eliminating child labor by the year
2000.  </tt><p>
<tt>Nepal will begin penalizing carpet weavers who employ children by asking
western carpet-importing countries to deny them tariff concessions.  The
Nepalese government's decision was in part a response to the falling sales of
carpets after Western buyers stopped purchasing products made by companies who
employ children. </tt><p>
<tt>Bangladesh, on the other hand, condemned reports by the Washington,
DC-based Child Labor Coalition that Bangladesh garment manufacturers employ
children.  The Bangladesh government plans to send a high-level delegation to
the US to detail the measures the garment makers have taken to eliminate child
labor from the industry.  </tt><p>
<tt>In response, the CLC has agreed to suspend a boycott against Bangladesh, so
that new negotiations can begin between the garment makers and the exporters
association.  Negotiations between the US, United Nations, exporters
association, and CLC resumed in June. </tt><p>
<tt>The US and France want to put labor standards, including child labor, on
the agenda of the World Trade Organization.  Germany has agreed with India that
non-trade issues, such as child labor, should not be raised that the WTO.

<a name="RTFToC3">House
Subcommittee Approves Immigration
Reform</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></h2>
<tt>On July 20, the House Judiciary's Immigration and Claims Subcommittee
approved by voice vote the Immigration in the National Interest Act of 1995, HR
1915, sponsored by Rep. Lamar Smith (R-TX), and co-sponsored by 59
representatives.  The measure will be considered by the full House Judiciary
Committee in September. </tt><p>
<tt>The measure deals with both legal and illegal immigration.  It would reduce
legal immigration by eliminating current slots reserved for the adult brothers
and sisters of US citizens.  </tt><p>
<tt>The bill seeks to reduce illegal immigration by doubling the number of INS
investigators, doubling the Border Patrol within the next five years, and
stiffening penalties for illegal use of counterfeit government documents.
Under the bill, states would be reimbursed for the costs of jailing illegal
immigrants, including those in county jails, and providing emergency health
care for illegal aliens.  The bill does not include a border crossing fee.
</tt><p>
<tt>The House Appropriations Committee attached an amendment to an omnibus
appropriations bill that would eliminate funding for inland immigration
checkpoints near San Clemente and Temecula and move the INS agents who
currently operate them to the border.  The change would be effective Oct. 1,
1995, when FY 1996 begins.  There are 35 active INS checkpoints in the
US.</tt><p>
<tt>The Border Patrol believes that the checkpoints are effective and asked for
full funding to keep them open all the time.  More than 150,000 aliens were
apprehended at the checkpoints during the past three years.  According to some
reports, 62 percent of all illegal entrants use smugglers to cross the
US-Mexican border, and then pay up to $300 in additional fees to be smuggled
past the active checkpoints.</tt><p>
<tt>At the end of June 1995, Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-CA) presented a list of 100
proposals to House Speaker Newt Gingrich with the promise that, if they were
adopted, illegal immigration would be drastically reduced.  The 54-member House
Task Force recommended that children born to illegal aliens in the US no longer
become US citizens automatically, and that hospitals wishing to be reimbursed
by the federal government notify the INS before releasing suspected illegal
alien patients.</tt><p>
<tt>Critics of these proposals worry that it could lead to the creation of a
permanent underclass of sub-citizens--immigrants who live in the US, but are
denied public schooling and government benefits.</tt><p>
<tt>Gallegly's task force also recommended that illegal aliens apprehended in
the US be fined $250 the first time caught, forfeit their assets the second
time, and face time in jail for a third apprehension.  The INS currently
fingerprints and photographs the 2,000 illegal aliens apprehended every day in
San Diego and, with an estimated 20 percent or 400 repeater offenders,
implementing this proposal would soon require far more than the 500-bed
detention facility currently available.  Gallegly recommended the use of closed
military bases to hold aliens.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC4">New
Asylum</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
Rules</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>The INS on January 4, 1995 implemented new regulations to reduce "abuse" of
the asylum system.  On July 5, 1995, the INS reported that these new
regulations have been successful in deciding quickly whether an alien needs
protection in the US. </tt><p>
<tt>The Clinton administration planned to adjudicate 150,000 asylum
applications by September 1995.  In the first eight months of FY95, the INS
completed more than 61,000 cases, compared to the 35,000 cases it adjudicated
during the same period last year.  There is a backlog of over 400,000 requests
for asylum awaiting INS decisions.</tt><p>
<tt>Aliens seeking asylum enter the US, and then file a form in person or by
mail that asserts that the individual seeking to stay in the US would face
persecution in his or her country of citizenship.  </tt><p>
<tt>The number of asylum seekers has climbed, and reached almost 150,000 in
FY94.  About one-fourth of all these asylum seekers are Guatemalans, one-eighth
are Salvadorans, and one-twelfth are Chinese.  Another 20,000 asylum claims
were filed by aliens who were in the process of being excluded from or deported
from the US.  About 20 percent of the aliens who ask for asylum are granted
permission to remain in the US.</tt><p>
<tt>The reforms announced in January 1995 have resulted in decisions on most
new cases filed within 10 to 14 days after applicants are interviewed by asylum
officers.  Asylum applicants are not eligible to work legally in the US until
at least 180 days after their application has been filed, or when it is
approved, whichever comes first.  One year after being granted asylum, aliens
are entitled to immigrant status.</tt><p>
<tt>To deter fraudulent claims for asylum, the INS is increasing detention and
speeding up the deportation of those denied asylum.  Asylum officers report
that, in many instances, individuals use the same words they have been coached
to repeat to describe their persecution.  These measures have decreased asylum
claims by 14 percent from January to May. </tt><p>
<tt>The INS has the authority to detain persons seeking asylum who do not have
any immigration documents.  Under legislation pending in Congress, applicants
for asylum who arrive in the US without documents and request asylum would be
excluded from the US while their claims are processed.  Aliens in the US would
have to request asylum within 30 days of arriving in the US--today, some aliens
wait until they are apprehended to apply for asylum.</tt><p>
<tt>In 1994, about 38,000 Cubans and 26,000 Haitians attempted to come to the
US in boats to apply for asylum.  To prevent their entry and process asylum
applications, the US established a safe haven for them in Guantanamo. </tt><p>
<tt>One hundred and eight Chinese refugees from the Golden Venture, which ran
aground near New York harbor in June 1993, are being held in York, Pennsylvania
while the INS determines whether they will be granted political asylum.  Only
five of the York detainees have been granted asylum, 26 have returned to China.
Some York residents hold a vigil for one hour every Sunday to demonstrate their
solidarity with the Chinese refugees. </tt><p>
<tt>On July 19, four of the Golden Venture refugees, testified before the House
Subcommittee on International Operations and Human Rights.  The women said that
they were forced to undergo abortions or sterilizations under unsanitary
conditions.  All four have been denied political asylum in the US.</tt><p>
<tt>Legislation that grant asylum to persons forced to undergo abortion or
sterilization was passed by the House and is pending in the Senate.  President
Clinton has threatened to veto the measure. </tt><p>
<tt>The INS detains over 80,000 asylum seekers annually, often in private
facilities operated by for-profit companies.  On June 18, some 300 asylum
seekers being held in a privately-operated detention center in Elizabeth, New
Jersey rioted, alleging that they were being mistreated.  On July 21, the INS
agreed with the asylum seekers, and canceled the company's five-year, $51
million contract to operate the facility.  The INS found that the facility was
run by poorly trained and abusive guards, who were left unsupervised by their
superiors. </tt><p>
<tt>An attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union said that similar abuses
can be found at other detention facilities around the country.  INS Commission
Meissner believes that the problems at the New Jersey facility were an isolated
incidence and plans to continue to use private detention centers.  Esmor
continues to detain aliens for the INS in the Seattle area.</tt><p>
<tt>In Florida, several nurseries have complained that if their Salvadoran
workers, some of whose work permits expire in September, 1995, leave, they will
face labor shortages.  Some have worked for 10 or more years for one
employer.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS is stepping up its efforts to deport criminal aliens, persons who
committed crimes in the US as illegal aliens (or became illegal aliens because
of the crime) served their sentences, and are now being deported.  In 1986,
2,000 criminal aliens were deported; in 1995, 22,000, and in 1996, the INS
plans to deport 58,000.</tt><p>

187</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a><a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></h2>
<tt>During a July 26, 1995 hearing, opponents of Prop. 187 told a federal judge
in Los Angeles that the measure was unconstitutional, and that she should
simply declare Prop. 187 unconstitutional without a trial.  Opponents argued
that the measure unconstitutionally interfered with the federal government's
jurisdiction over immigration policy.  </tt><p>
<tt>Opponents argued that only the federal government, and not the state
government, can take steps designed to reduce illegal immigration.  According
to one anti-187 attorney, "California has no business, no business at all,
saying who may come in and who may go out."</tt><p>
<tt>The state of California countered that the purpose of Prop. 187 was to
decide how scarce state resources should be allocated among persons who apply
for benefits under state-run programs.  The state offered the judge a draft
letter that would be given to suspected illegal aliens that advises them to
either leave the US, or contact the INS to resolve their legal status.  </tt><p>
<tt>The judge has several options, including declaring part or all of Prop. 187
unconstitutional, and scheduling a trial on the entire initiative or the
sections deemed constitutional.  That trial is currently scheduled for
September.  </tt><p>
<tt>If the judge declares Prop. 187 unconstitutional, state lawyers say they
will file an appeal with the US 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.  The group that
sponsored Prop. 187 has threatened to offer a $10,000 reward to anyone who can
prove that the judge personally hired an illegal alien; Prop. 187 proponents
believe that the judge personally opposes Prop. 187.</tt><p>
<tt>Legal observers predict the case will reach the US Supreme Court in 1996 or
1997. </tt><p>
<tt>Several hundred college and law students are participating in a California
Freedom Summer campaign to take testimony from immigrants that Prop. 187 has
led to or increased discrimination against them.  The first Freedom Summer was
in 1964, when college students flooded Mississippi to register Black
voters.</tt><p>

<tt>In June, Los Angeles area garment manufacturers signed an agreement with
the US Labor Department to begin policing labor practices.  Under the
Compliance Alliance, private police hired by manufacturers are to assist
government labor investigators by auditing contractors and identifying shops
that break laws on minimum wage, overtime pay and child labor.</tt><p>
<tt>Over the past five years, garment making in Los Angeles has become an $8
billion annual industry.  Over 150,000 workers are employed by manufacturers
and contractors in Los Angeles. </tt><p>
<tt>Under the three-year old Target Industries Partnership Program (TIP), state
and federal authorities combined forces to conduct monthly sweeps to enforce
labor laws in the garment and agriculture industries.  </tt><p>
<tt>During one two-hour sting operation, violations for illegal cash payments
and unpaid overtime resulted in $20,000 in fines.  Over 90 percent of the 4,000
garment contractors in Los Angles have 50 or fewer employees, and many are
non-English speaking.  Some employers close up shop after being fined, and then
re-open under a new name at a different location. </tt><p>
<tt>In 1994, investigators conducted about 500 garment industry audits
statewide -- most of them in Los Angeles -- assessing $4.5 million in penalties
and collecting $2.6 million in unpaid wages.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC7">Reaction
to CIR Proposals</a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>Strange bedfellows attacked the Commission on Immigration Reform's
proposals to reduce and restructure legal immigration.  The Wall Street Journal
on July 3 attacked what it called "bipartisan animosity" toward legal
immigrants. </tt><p>
<tt>Most of the attacks on the CIR recommendations were directed at the
recommendation to reduce the number of immigrants admitted for economic and
employment, and to require US employers who bring immigrants to the US to pay
more than the prevailing wage, plus a fee into a training fund to prepare US
workers for these jobs.  </tt><p>
<tt>The number of professionals and skilled workers seeking one of the 150,000
visas reserved for such workers and their families--the quota was higher in
1994 because of unused slots from earlier years-- fell from 147,000 in 1993 to
123,300 in 1994, largely because such immigrants did not apply for
visas.</tt><p>
<tt>The Wall Street Journal editorial argued that adopting the CIR's
recommendation to reduce the number of immigrants admitted for economic or
employment reasons from 140,000 to 100,000 annually would be costly to US
high-tech firms.  Microsoft, the software firm, reports that three to four
percent of its 12,000 US-based employees are foreign born. </tt><p>
<tt>USA Today analyzed data on 2.2 million immigrants who arrived between 1991
and 1993, and concluded that if the US changes its immigration system to give
more weight to personal characteristics that produce high US earnings, then the
sources of US immigrants would change.  For example, 52 percent of the 1993
immigrants from Mexico reporting an occupation listed laborer, while 0.3
percent were engineers.  By contrast, one percent of Indian immigrants were
laborers, and 25 percent were engineers.</tt><p>
<tt>In 1993, 40 percent of all legal immigrants came from five countries:
Mexico, China, the Philippines, Vietnam and the Dominican Republic. Most head
for New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, Miami and Houston.</tt><p>
<tt>According to a USA Today/Gallup poll, 65 percent of all respondents, and 30
percent of immigrant respondents, think that immigration should be reduced;
seven percent of all respondents, and 15 percent of immigrant respondents,
think that immigration should be increased.  Almost 60 percent of immigrants
and other respondents think that immigrants should "blend in" to American
culture, versus about one-third who think that immigrants should do more to
maintain their own culture.</tt><p>
<tt>Asian immigrant groups attacked proposals by the CIR that were endorsed by
President Clinton to eliminate the quotas for adult relatives of US citizens to
enter the US as immigrants.  According to their data, 40 percent of all adult
children of US citizens, and two-thirds of all adult brothers and sisters of US
citizens, are Asians.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC8">INS
to Open Shelter for Undocumented
Children</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>The INS in August will begin to house unaccompanied and minor illegal
aliens in Tucson, Arizona, and later in El Paso, Texas.  In Tucson, refugee
advocates reportedly cared for 470 undocumented minors in 1994, up from 188 in
1993.  Most Mexican children are sent home immediately, but children from more
distant countries, such as Nicaragua, often remain in the US while their case
is being decided.  The INS prefers to release children to their families or
foster parents rather than detain them.</tt><p>
<tt>The children, all under 18, will be housed from several nights to several
months while the INS decides their case.  The average stay is expected to be 21
days.  Currently, if family or foster care cannot be found for unaccompanied
minors, they are sent to shelters in California or Texas.  The shelter will
have 32 to 48 beds, which leads critics to complain that it is too large and
may mean the children are detained longer than necessary. </tt><p>
<tt>The INS opened the shelter because of recent court rulings that require
illegal immigrant children to be housed apart from unrelated adults or criminal
juveniles.  The shelter will be run by Southwest Key, a private, non-profit
organization that runs about 25 treatment programs for juvenile delinquents in
Texas, Arizona and Puerto Rico.  This concerns some who say the organization
deals with delinquents, not children without criminal histories.  Southwest Key
will be paid by the federal government about $80 per child per day. </tt><p>
<tt>Church groups criticized the plan.  They argue that by holding the
children, the government is using the children as "bait" to catch their illegal
immigrant parents who are already living in the US.  </tt><p>
<tt>The INS announced it will replace current border-crossing cards with a
tamper proof one with finger or handprints.  The change, the first in 40 years,
is scheduled to begin on Oct. 1.  </tt><p>
<tt>In 1994, the INS received 225,000 applications for border-crossing cards,
most from those along the Texas border.  To qualify, applicants must prove in
an interview that they live and work in the border region.  Temporary cards are
issued the same day. </tt><p>

<tt>Despite strong statements against agricultural guest workers in June 1995
by both President Clinton and the Jordan Commission on Immigration Reform,
California farm organizations continued their quest to include a guest worker
program in immigration reform legislation moving through Congress.  As in the
mid-1980s, the growers argue that, despite employer sanctions and high
unemployment rates among US farm workers, at least 30 to 50 percent of their
seasonal workers are unauthorized.</tt><p>
<tt>If immigration reforms successfully reduce unauthorized immigration and
employment, growers argue, there would be farm labor shortages that could not
be dealt with through the current H-2A program that admits temporary foreign
workers to fill vacant US farm jobs.  </tt><p>
<tt>Critics argue that there would be no shortage of farm workers if growers
raised wages and improved working conditions.  Many advocates assert that the
H-2A program includes work guarantees and housing requirements to avoid
exploitation.  Growers say the rules make the H-2A program too bureaucratic and
expensive.</tt><p>
<tt>On July 11, Secretary of Labor Robert Reich held a press conference near
Fresno, California to announce that so far in FY95, DOL had assessed growers
and contractors about $2.1 million for underpayment of 2,700 farm workers.  In
a few cases, growers responded to fines by announcing publicly that they were
taking corrective actions, but most growers responded that they do comply with
federal and state laws.  </tt><p>
<tt>An important issue is whether the creation of an alternative to the H-2A
program would increase or decrease illegal immigration.  The Bracero program
that gave between one and two million Mexican workers experience in the US farm
labor market, and is widely believed to have laid the ground work for
subsequent illegal immigration.</tt><p>
<tt>Washington State fruit growers are asking Congress for permission to import
guest workers for the first time in 40 years.  The Washington State Apple
Commission said as many as 50,000 temporary workers are required to harvest the
state's $ 1 billion-a-year apple crop.  Some estimate that 30 percent of
Washington's farm workers are illegal. </tt><p>
<tt>At a presidential summit in Portland in late June, Harry Kubo of Fresno
urged Clinton to endorse agriculture's need for "guest workers."</tt><p>
<tt>A University of California study found that the number of workers employed
by farm labor contractors in California has risen steadily since the late
1980s.  In interviews, the growers said that a major reason why they turn to
farm labor contractors is increasing regulation of the farm labor market--using
contractors allows growers to turn the cost and liability of immigration and
labor law violations over to a third party, and competition between contractors
to supply workers to growers has kept the cost of using a third party about the
same as directly hiring workers.</tt><p>
<tt>Only one of the eleven growers interviewed said a labor shortage was the
reason a labor contractor was used. </tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC10">Economics,
Education, and Immigration</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>Economist George Borjas estimated that the net benefits of current
immigration are about $7 billion annually, or equivalent to half of Microsoft
CEO Bill Gates' net worth, or as much as Americans spend gambling each week.
According to Borjas, immigration generates $140 billion per year in benefits to
the US, mostly from higher land and capital prices, and imposes $133 billion
per year in costs, primarily in lower wages and unemployment among US
workers.</tt><p>
<tt>The nation's 27 million Hispanics in 1994 are 10 percent of the US
population.  A Census report released in July reported that, in 1994, only nine
percent of Hispanics 25 and older had BA degrees or more, versus 24 percent of
non-Hispanics.  This 2.7 ratio of non-Hispanic to Hispanic college graduates
widened since 1970, when there were 2.3 non-Hispanic BA degree holders for
every Hispanic degree holder.  About 13 percent of adult Blacks had college
degrees in 1994.</tt><p>
<tt>Years of education is the best single predictor of income in the US.  In
mid-1995, the median weekly earnings of full-time workers 25 and older without
a high school diploma was $309, versus $428 for high-school graduates, and $593
for high-school graduates with some college.  The 30 percent of the adult work
force with college degrees earned a median $750 per week.</tt><p>
<tt>Real wages have been falling, and many workers reportedly feel poorer
because the gap between wages and salaries and total compensation has widened
as more of their compensation comes in the form of fringe benefits.  This means
that workers who get few fringe benefits have seen both their real hourly wages
decline and, since they get few fringe benefits, their total compensation
decline.</tt><p>
<tt>Low earnings translate into relatively paltry savings for retirement.
According to a recent survey, a typical white household with members aged 51 to
60 had less than $18,000 in personal wealth (plus $70,000 in home equity),
while Black and Hispanic households in this age range had less than $500 in
non-real estate wealth.  Claims to social security and private pensions
accounted for over half of the typical 51 to 60 household's wealth.</tt><p>
<tt>Some mainstream US universities are very dependent on foreign students.  In
1994, for example, Boston University and the University of Southern California
had the most foreign students in 1994, 4,700 and 4,300, respectively, and
University of Wisconsin-Madison and University of Texas-Austin followed with
4,000 each.  Most foreign students from countries such as Japan and Hong Kong
pay full tuition, encouraging US universities to "market" themselves
abroad.</tt><p>
<tt>US schools that cater to resident immigrants have been accused of
fraudulently enrolling needy immigrants in order to collect grant funds from
them.  For example, the Iade American Schools in Los Angeles was accused of
collecting $58 million in Pell grants to needy students to enroll Hispanic
immigrants in classes such as auto mechanic and English as a Second
Language.</tt><p>
<tt>A Stanford-Rand study concluded that there are too many PhDs produced in
the US, and that graduate schools continue to admit students to satisfy their
need for teaching and research assistants, not because there are jobs waiting
for graduates.  Unemployment among persons with PhDs is low but, it is
asserted, the reason for low unemployment is because many persons with PhDs are
underemployed or employed in jobs that do not use the research skills they
acquired.</tt><p>
<tt>The Stanford-Rand study concluded that there are, in fields such as
computer science, 50 percent too many PhDs being produced, 44 percent too many
mechanical engineering PhDs, and 30 percent too many physics, chemistry, and
mathematics PhDs.  The report concluded that increased federal funding for
science and engineering will only aggravate the situation by delaying the
needed shrinking of PhD programs.</tt><p>
<tt>There are estimates that 25 to 40 percent of the scientists and engineers
who work in some US research labs are foreign born.  This may be true, but most
of the nation's two million scientists and engineers-- in a US labor force of
120 million--are US-born.</tt><p>
<tt>In a related development, the US Department of Labor in mid-June began to
include private companies in the calculation of prevailing wages that
universities must pay to post-doctorate foreign researchers, significantly
raising their wages.  Research labs and medical schools have been forced to
raise wages by 30 to 60 percent, so that they pay at least 95 percent of the
prevailing wage.</tt><p>
<tt>In some cases, foreigners working on research grants must be paid,
according to revised DOL prevailing wage standards, more than the government
agency making the research grant permits.  If the foreign lab workers are
switched from F to H-1B visas, then there is no prevailing wage
requirement.</tt><p>
<tt>The Labor Department says the change in policy should eliminate financial
incentives to hire foreign workers over Americans.  But educators say it will
result in pricing universities out of important research because there are not
enough Americans doing similar research.</tt><p>
<tt>Several newspapers investigated the H-1B program that admits up to 65,000
temporary foreign workers annually and reported that US employers abuse the
"attestation process" that permits them to certify that they looked for but
failed to find US workers at prevailing wages and conditions.  According to one
lawyer, the trick is to describe "the relevant job opening tightly enough that
the INS recognizes an American probably isn't readily available for the
position, but not so tightly that the INS suspects the description is being
tailored for a specific foreign individual."</tt><p>
<tt>Employers usually have a foreign worker in mind when they request that the
US Department of Labor certify their need for foreign workers.  In 1995, only
once in every 200 times did the employer who requested foreign workers hire a
US worker who was referred to the vacant job for which the foreign was sought.
DOL reportedly spends $50 million annually on labor certification
activities.</tt><p>
<tt>The firm that maintains the White House correspondence system, Mastech,
reportedly imported about 1,000 of its 1,200 workers from India under the H-1B
program, and is currently being investigated.  Two companies that have been
heavy users of the program that permits US employers to bring permanent
immigrants to the US to fill vacant jobs are Showell Farms and ConAgra Poultry.
Showell Farms has reportedly brought "hundreds" of Koreans to the US to be
poultry workers for $5 per hour.</tt><p>
<tt>Between 1988 and 1994, employers used the Permanent Alien Certification
program to bring to the US 793 auto body repairers, 650 carpenters, 186 pizza
bakers, 104 car wash attendants, 82 doughnut makers, 51 barbers, 48 insurance
salesmen, 35 salad makers, 33 manicurists, 28 chauffeurs, 26 tire repairers, 15
social secretaries, and 12 garbage truck drivers.</tt><p>
<tt>A New York church asked DOL for permission to bring an immigrant to the US
to be a missionary on the streets of New York, claiming that Americans "lacked
enthusiasm and determination" for such work.  DOL refused to certify the
church's need for the alien.</tt><p>
<tt>One California investigator estimates that 40 percent of employer
applications for immigrants to fill vacant jobs are fraudulent, in most cases,
the alien is already working, and the employer simply wants to legalize his or
her status.</tt><p>

</a></h2>
<tt>The Mexican stock market is up 50 percent since its February 27, 1995 low
of 1448, but there are fears that political scandals and violence will slow the
recovery from the current recession.</tt><p>
<tt>The government now projects that Mexican GDP will shrink two percent in
1995, and grow by three percent in 1996.  But domestic consumption has fallen
drastically in the wake of two million layoffs since December 1995, and
increased exports have not been able to absorb many unemployed workers.</tt><p>
<tt>The US House Representatives on July 19 voted to prohibit the US Treasury
from lending more money to Mexico.  In January 1995, the US promised Mexico up
to $20 billion in funds to support the peso; about $12.5 billion has been sent
to Mexico so far.</tt><p>
<tt>In a review of what went wrong in Mexico in December 1994, much of the
blame was laid on ex-Finance minister Pedro Aspe, who successfully resisted a
Salinas-Zedillo agreement to devalue the peso on November 20, 1994, shortly
before Salinas left office.  Aspe was afraid that a devaluation would halt the
influx of foreign investment in Mexico.</tt><p>
<tt>Mexican officials argued that the country could continue to run a trade
deficit financed by foreign investors because Mexico was importing capital
goods that would accelerate its growth rate.  But less than one-fourth of
Mexico's imports in 1994 were capital goods.</tt><p>
<tt>Some US investors reinforced Mexico's decision not to devalue, and
encouraged Mexico to issue so-called tesobonos, government debt that was repaid
in pesos at a pre-announced exchange rate.  If Mexico devalued, these tesobonos
would increase the country's foreign debt in dollar terms.</tt><p>
<tt>Mexico in 1995 has been running a trade surplus with the US, largely
because the peso devaluation made exports cheaper and imports more expensive.
</tt><p>
<tt>A profile of a tobacco firm in Nayarit, about 400 miles northwest of Mexico
City, demonstrated the positive role that large companies can play in reforming
Mexico's agricultural sector.  Mexico has about six million farmers scattered
across 400 million acres of arable land, but they generate only about eight
percent of Mexico's $350 million GDP. [The US has about two million farmers and
one billion acres of farm land, although crops are harvested from only 300
million acres].</tt><p>
<tt>About 20 percent of Mexico's farm land is held in small farms of less than
10 acres each.  The tobacco company coordinates farmers willing to work
together in 150 to 200 acre blocks.  The farmers then farm as instructed, with
equipment, seeds, and loans provided by the tobacco company.  Profits are split
50-50--four acres of low-grade tobacco returns about $4,000 annually for the
farm family's labor.  The tobacco company, La Moderna, also exported $130
million worth of fresh produce to the US in 1994.</tt><p>
<tt>The Solidarity program, which spent $15 billion in federal funds between
1988 and 1994 to help Mexican communities build infrastructure, is yet another
Salinas-era program under attack in Mexico.  Salinas hoped to be remembered for
NAFTA and Solidarity, but critics now charge that Solidarity was simply a
program to keep poor Mexicans voting PRI while the country restricted its
economy.</tt><p>
<tt>In addition to charges that some communities built projects such as
baseball stadiums, it has been alleged that the temporary jobs created by
Solidarity do little to help Mexico's 15 million very poor people.  One
analysis found that Solidarity funds were targeted in swing districts, and that
every one percent increase in PRI votes in 1991 midterm elections was rewarded
with an additional $2.50 per voter spent on Solidarity projects.</tt><p>
<tt>The government argues that Solidarity funds are spent in all 31 Mexican
states, including the four governed by the opposition.  </tt><p>
<tt>Mexico built 6,000 kilometers of new roads during Salinas' six-year term
between 1988-1994, with $14 billion in private foreign investment.  The
government is being forced to bail out several of these projects, largely
because private construction companies far overestimated usage and revenues
from high tolls when obtaining loans from state-owned banks.  </tt><p>
<tt>The government often awarded road concessions to the bidder that offered
the shortest time period of private ownership, usually 14 years until the
project was to be turned over to the government.  Road concessions are being
lengthened up to 30 years.  Roads are a high priority in Mexico because 80
percent of Mexican exports move by land.</tt><p>
<tt>Maquiladoras are foreign-owned factories in Mexico that import components
and assemble electronics, auto parts, and other products to export, usually
back to the US.  After the 1982 peso devaluation, the number of maquiladoras
mushroomed, so that, in the early 1990s, some 2,000 factories employed about
500,000 Mexican workers.</tt><p>
<tt>Maquiladoras were expected to shrink as NAFTA eliminated tariffs, but they
have not.  Recent projections are that almost 400 maquiladoras will be added by
the year 2000, raising the Mexican work force employed in foreign-owned
factories from 579,000 in 1994 to 943,000 in 2000.  Wages and benefits in the
maquiladoras averaged about $1.80 per hour in mid-1995, and are projected to
remain below $2.50 per hour until the year 2000.</tt><p>
<tt>Ciudad Juarez, which lies across the US-Mexican border from El Paso, added
about 40,000 jobs in the last year.  Juarez expects to add another 30,000 jobs
this year despite the peso devaluation and economic crisis.  NAFTA is credited
with creating these jobs, most of which are in Juarez's 300 maquiladoras.
</tt><p>
<tt>El Paso is the fourth-largest city in Texas, and the third-fastest growing
metropolitan area in the US.  Juarez is Mexico's fourth-largest urban center.
El Paso grows through middle-class suburban developments, while Juarez adds
shantytowns west of the city's garbage dump.</tt><p>
<tt>Despite maquiladora jobs, many Mexicans still try to find work in El Paso.
But Operation Hold the Line seems to be making it more difficult to commute
regularly as an illegal alien to a job in El Paso.  The INS plans to build a
ten foot high wall along about 1.3 miles of border in a New Mexico suburb of El
Paso to discourage aliens from going around Operation Hold the Line
agents.</tt><p>
<tt>Some downtown merchants have lost as much as 50 percent of their business
since Hold the Line, although the peso devaluation and NAFTA also undoubtedly
contributed to declining sales.  Car thefts and car and home burglaries are
down about 30 percent in El Paso.</tt><p>
<tt>The US  is reportedly worried about the booming drug trade in Mexico;
Mexico earned an estimated $7 billion in 1994 by shipping Colombian drugs into
the US, or almost twice as much as remittances from Mexican workers in the US.
Some of the money used to buy newly-privatized companies in Mexico was
reportedly drug money.  Some US officials fear that the police in Mexico have
been largely compromised by accepting money to protect drug barons. </tt><p>

Border Controls</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>The Schengen agreement, designed to abolish border controls between the
seven signatories, went into effect on March 26, 1995, and passport controls
were scheduled to be phased out on July 1, 1995.  Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg,
the Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain ended passport controls on their common
borders on July 1 as scheduled.  France used a safety clause in the Schengen
agreement to maintain its border controls, citing fears of illegal immigration
after the EU denied a request for a six-month extension. </tt><p>
<tt>France cited fears of illegal immigration from some of its Schengen
partners as the reason why it would maintain passport controls for another six
months.  France noted that, in the three months since Schengen went into effect
on March 26, 1995, four of the seven member nations had failed to report to
Schengen computers any stolen identity documents, and only one had reported any
stolen cars.  France also complained that drug traffic along its northern
borders increased by almost 60 percent in April-May 1995.</tt><p>
<tt>The number of foreigners refused entry to France fell by two-thirds in
April-May 1995, which the National Front said demonstrates France's failure to
control its own borders.</tt><p>
<tt>Most commentaries decried the French refusal to join in border-free Europe,
since France is one of the most ardent supporters of European integration.
Many asserted that France delayed Schengen implementation for fear of further
strengthening the National Front, which has asserted that under Schengen,
illegal immigration to France will increase.</tt><p>
<tt>The French decision bolsters the position of the UK, which argues that
border-free Europe would increase illegal immigration and criminal
activities.</tt><p>
<tt>The EU is scheduled to release a plan in July 1995 to remove passport
controls between all member nations, which would be equivalent to extending
Schengen to all EU member nations.</tt><p>
<tt>The election of several National Front mayors in local French elections in
June obscured the fact that only two of France's 225 cities of 30,000 or more
have National Front mayors.  Indeed, there are so many local positions in
France--over 500,000--that about one percent of the French population holds
some local office.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC14">Regulating
the German Labor Market</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>Germany probably spends more to prevent the employment of illegal foreign
workers than any other country; about five times more per worker than the US.
</tt><p>
<tt>In 1994, there were over 78,000 inspections of German employers suspected
of employing illegal aliens, and almost half (42,000) led to fines of DM 24
million (US $17 million) and/or warnings.  The INS fined US employers $11
million in 1994 for employing illegal aliens and/or not completing I-9
forms.</tt><p>
<tt>Germany has about 1,500 labor market inspectors and, at an annual cost of
about DM 100,000 (US $70,000) per inspector, the Labor Ministry spends about DM
150 million (US $110 million) annually to, e.g., prevent German workers from
drawing UI benefits while working and to prevent illegal foreign workers from
finding jobs.  In a labor market with about 40 million workers, Germany spends
almost $3 per worker on labor law enforcement.  </tt><p>
<tt>The US, by contrast, had 245 INS worksite investigators in 1994, and an
additional 900 Department of Labor inspectors.  At an average cost of $75,000
per inspector, the US spends $86 million annually on federal labor law
enforcement, or $0.66 per worker.</tt><p>
<tt>German officials believe that the desire to preserve a generous welfare
state and an orderly labor market helps them to obtain the resources necessary
for effective enforcement.  For example, German labor inspectors can obtain
local police support for worksite inspections at no cost to the labor ministry;
when four or five labor inspectors enter a construction site, for example, they
may have 50 or 100 local police to surround the site and prevent workers from
running away.  </tt><p>
<tt>German enforcement officials report that German firms try to avoid negative
publicity, so they tend to pay rather than contest fines.  If a German firm
contests a fine, its name can be made public.  Fines are registered with local
chambers of commerce, and public agencies and other firms can require employers
bidding for contracts to provide information about that firm's labor law
violations.</tt><p>
<tt>The German Labor Ministry announced that it would conduct intensive
investigations of illegal employment in Brandenburg, the state surrounding
Berlin, beginning in summer 1995.  Berlin is currently the largest construction
project in Europe, and perhaps the world, and thousands of foreign workers have
streamed into the city to seek construction jobs.   </tt><p>
<tt>There are currently 43 labor inspectors in Brandenburg, a labor market with
just under one million workers.  For the next two years, another 150 inspectors
will be added, which means that in the Berlin area, DM20 million (US $14
million) per year, or about $14 per worker, will be spent to detect and
discourage labor law violations.</tt><p>
<tt>The employment of legal foreign workers from elsewhere in the EU in Berlin
prompted the German Labor Ministry on June 27 to push for a new law to raise
the wages that must be paid to EU construction workers in Germany beginning in
Fall 1995.  </tt><p>
<tt>Under the so-called Entsendereglung proposal, EU construction workers with
freedom of movement rights would have to be paid at least the minimum wage
negotiated between German construction unions and construction companies,
currently about 20DM (US$ 14) per hour, plus offer them the same vacation pay
available to unionized German workers [payroll taxes add about 70 percent or DM
14 (US $ 10) to the hourly wage for German workers].  Employers violating this
law, which would remain in effect only for two years, could be fined up to
DM50,000 (US $ 35,000).</tt><p>
<tt>The opposition SPD claims that the new law does not go far enough and wants
the government to require employers to pay all workers in Germany full German
wages and benefits.  The SPD would also ban low-wage workers from all
industries, not just construction. </tt><p>
<tt>The 1.4 million workers in the German construction industry, plus 800,000
in associated industries, include about 150,000 foreign workers.  The
foreigners include 110,000 from EU nations such as the UK, Ireland, and
Portugal, and 35,000 East Europeans, mostly from Poland and the Czech Republic.
</tt><p>
<tt>Foreign workers are paid as little as DM6 (US $ 4.25)per hour, and they do
not receive German benefits, since they are considered employees of e.g.,
British or Irish firms and temporarily assigned to Germany.  EU workers have
the right to enter Germany and seek most jobs on an equal basis with German
workers.</tt><p>
<tt>In several cases, Dutch firms founded construction firms in Portugal, and
the Portuguese firm made an agreement with a German firm to provide workers for
DM 20 to 30 (US $14 to $20) per hour.  The Portuguese workers were paid DM 6 to
8 (US $ 4.25 to $5.60), and the Dutch firm kept the difference, satisfying all
parties involved, but producing unemployment and complaints from German
construction workers.</tt><p>
<tt>Many foreigners are prepared to perform tasks deemed too dangerous by
German builders.  Most work a 70-hour week, almost twice as long as their
German counterparts.</tt><p>
<tt>There are currently 137,000 unemployed German construction workers, and
bankruptcies among small German construction firms rose 24 percent in 1994 over
1993.  Unemployed German construction workers receive an average DM40,000 (US $
28,000) per year in unemployment insurance benefits.</tt><p>
<tt>In addition to employing EU workers at lower-than-German wages, many
British workers allegedly claim to be self-employed carpenters or masons who
migrate to Germany to offer their services under the freedom of services
provisions of the EU.  Germans allege that they are not truly "independent
contractors," and thus are not exempt from payroll taxes and minimum wages
because, inter alia, they are often (illegally) supervised on German work
sites, and they are not enrolled in local German associations of independent
contractors.  </tt><p>
<tt>Germany has proposed that all independent contractors from other EU
countries be required to register with the local craftspersons' association,
which would review each applicant's credentials before granting
certificates.</tt><p>
<tt>A sweep of hotels and restaurants involving 3,600 inspectors and police in
March 1995 found that 830 of the 3,600 restaurants checked had illegal foreign
workers.  About 6,000 or 43 percent of the 15,000 employees were foreigners who
were required to have work permits, and 1,300 of them (22 percent) did not.
Two-thirds of the 15,000 restaurant employees did not have their social
insurance cards on them, as required in construction, hotels and restaurants,
and in fairs and other temporary exhibitions.</tt><p>
<tt>Germany continues to debate whether its regulated labor market and social
welfare system slows down job growth and increases unemployment.  Between 1982
and 1993, Germany created 3.25 million net new jobs, and an additional 1.4
million net new jobs are expected to be created by 1999.  German firms created
an estimated 70,000 jobs abroad in 1994, a trend that worries those who want to
preserve Germany's lead in manufacturing.  German employers argue that
Germany's high business taxes must be reduced, and that labor market and
business regulations eased in order to keep Germany competitive.  </tt><p>
<tt>The argument over whether an inclusive social safety net hurts
competitiveness is being waged in many European countries.  Employers complain
that strict labor laws discourage weekend and night work, so that expensive
capital equipment is not fully used, while sick leave that averages one month
or 22 days per year, plus four- to six-week paid vacations, leave German
workers with too few workdays.</tt><p>
<tt>German employers recommend relaxing labor laws, ending store closing
requirements--most stores must currently close at 6:30 p.m. and on Saturday
afternoons and Sundays--and permitting households to deduct the wages paid to
maids, which employers estimate could create an estimated 500,000 to 600,000
jobs.</tt><p>
<tt>There have in 1995 been fewer predictions of the German and European "need"
for immigrants to offset the demographic reality of aging populations and
declining labor forces.  The EU commissioned studies in 1993 that concluded
that, without immigration, the EU population would decline by about three
percent between 1990 and 2020, to 333 million and, at current labor force
participation rates, the EU labor force would decline by eight percent, from
157 million to 144 million.</tt><p>
<tt>To maintain the EU population and labor force at early 1990s levels, the EU
would have to admit 900,000 immigrants annually, including 400,000 per year
into Germany, 200,000 per year to Italy, 80,000 per year to Spain, 60,000 per
year to France, and 50,000 per year or less for the all other EU nations except
Ireland.</tt><p>
<tt>Correction: The July 1995 issue of Migration News mistakenly reported that
German negotiations with Vietnam were concluded and repatriations would begin
in summer 1995.  A final agreement was not signed until July 21, 1995.</tt><p>
<tt>Under the agreement, about 40,000 Vietnamese nationals in Germany without
valid documents are to be returned to Vietnam.  The final sticking point in the
negotiations was Vietnam's demand that those being deported from Germany are in
fact Vietnamese citizens.  It was agreed that nationality would be determined
by birth certificates, seaman's papers, drivers license, witnesses, or the
person's own admission.  Germany has also agreed to give Vietnam US $72 million
in development aid. </tt><p>
<tt>There is some dispute about the number of Vietnamese living in Germany and
how many are subject to repatriation.  Of the 60,000 Vietnamese who were
working in East Germany in 1989-90, about 15,000 are still in Germany.  Over 80
percent of them have a residence status that will allow them to attain
permanent residence by 2001, which is in some cases 19 years after their
arrival.</tt><p>
<tt>Some Vietnamese residents--including rejected asylum seekers-- have a
"Duldung" ("tolerance"), which in most cases does NOT allow them to work.
These Vietnamese could be repatriated under the agreement.  Together with
asylum-seekers whose applications have not yet been decided, but who are likely
to be rejected, some estimate that 20,000 Vietnamese could be deported,
although most newspapers quote the government's 40,000 estimate. </tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC15">Brit</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>ish
Crackdown on Immigrant Benefit</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>s
</a></h2>
<tt>Claiming that nearly L100 million a year is lost in immigrant benefit
fraud, the British Home Secretary announced a crackdown to spot suspected
illegal aliens in welfare offices, hospitals and universities.  The crackdown
includes: stopping non-contributory benefits for illegal or temporary
residents, tightening access to student awards and loans, legislation to make
non citizens ineligible for social housing, and asking hospital trusts and
general practitioners to prevent ineligible foreigners from getting access to
free NHS treatment.  </tt><p>
<tt>Most of these measures are not expected to be implemented until
1996.</tt><p>
<tt>Four government departments will work closely with the Home Office on these
proposals - prompting concern that the Department of Education and Employment
will encourage head teachers to see if any of their pupils come from families
of illegal immigrants.</tt><p>
<tt>The Department of the Environment will ensure that people from abroad are
not entitled to council houses; the Department of Social Security has already
tightened up procedures to prevent illegal immigrants from claiming income
support, housing benefits and council tax benefits.  The Department of Health
will work on better ways to control access to free NHS treatment.</tt><p>
<tt>Some teachers and health professionals were angry that they would be asked
to become immigration police.  Unision, the public services union, claimed that
the plan was an attempt to get immigration enforcement "on the cheap," and
would undermine the integrity of public service. </tt><p>
<tt>No one knows how many illegal aliens are in the UK; estimates range from
20,000 to 1 million.  In 1994, 5,032 illegal aliens were apprehended in the
UK.</tt><p>
<tt>The British Home Office says that the number of illegal immigrants has
almost doubled since 1989 to an estimated 13,000 in 1994.  In 1994, 23,000 of
the 66,000 passengers stopped at posts and airports were refused entry,
compared to 17,000 of 61,000 in 1992. </tt><p>
<tt>Newspaper stories report that there continue to be large numbers of sham
marriages in the UK.  Marriage to a British national includes the right to live
permanently in the UK after a one-year probationary period, and it is asserted
that especially ethnic youth are attracted to the $500 to $2,000 paid for
marrying a foreigner.  An investigation revealed that, in one office, 146 of
154 marriages involving Ghanaians and Nigerians were bogus<b>.</b></tt><p>
<tt><b></b>France in December 1994 proposed that all EU nations introduce
employer sanctions, and that public servants be required to report suspected
illegal aliens to immigration agencies.  The UK has 800 immigration officers

Deports Illegal Immigrants</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>The French interior ministry announced that it plans to double the number
of illegal aliens deported from 10,000 to 20,000 per year.  About 45,000
illegal aliens are apprehended in France each year, and the government
announced that it would initiate weekly deportation flights.</tt><p>
<tt>France expelled 81 Romanians, mostly gypsies, this month and many
complained that French police physically abused them.  A week later, 43
undocumented Africans were deported to Zaire.  The French Interior Minster
warned that the highly publicized expulsions, following the suspension of  the
Schengen open-border agreement, demonstrated France's determination to halt
illegal immigration. </tt><p>
<tt>Amnesty International criticized France on July 12 for expelling the
Romanian migrants, saying that it has found that members of Romania's large
gypsy minority were sometimes jailed, solely on grounds of ethnic origin, for
disturbing public order.</tt><p>
<tt>The new French government has announced that its top priority is to create
jobs--700,000 by the end of 1996.  French employers have been offered wage
subsidies if they hire unemployed youth and adults who have been unemployed for
one year or more.</tt><p>
<tt>France became a magnet for North Africans, in part because of fringe
benefits guaranteed by law: six-week vacations, mandated health care and a
$1,3000 monthly minimum wage.  But these same social protections, are also
expensive.  There is continued rhetoric, that if three million immigrants were
expelled, there will be jobs for the three million unemployed French. </tt><p>
<tt>Observers say tensions are especially high in southeastern France, where
many of the North Africans settled.  A leading Algerian political activist
warns that it could all end very badly, as tensions continue to rise. </tt><p>
<tt>French farmers in April 1995 stopped trucks bringing Spanish strawberries
to France and destroyed them.  The EU Commission threatened to bring France
before the EU Court of Justice for failing to prosecute the farmers involved in
disrupting internal EU trade.  Spanish strawberries are reportedly cheaper than
French berries because of the availability of cheap labor in Spain and the
devalued peseta.</tt><p>

<tt>Spain, which is only 10 miles from North Africa at the Strait of Gibraltar,
seems to worry less about immigration from North Africa than France and Italy.
One reason is that, for historical reason, Spain has far fewer its nationals
living in the Maghreb countries than does either France or Italy.  </tt><p>
<tt>Spain took over the EU Presidency on July 1, 1995, and is expected to
follow France in shifting EU attention and aid to North Africa at an
EU-Mediterranean conference in Barcelona in November.  Some observers note that
Spain spends less of its GDP on defense than any other EU nation--just over one
percent--so that the country hopes for the best, but is ill-prepared for the
worst.</tt><p>
<tt>Europe's southern members states are particularly concerned that further
political destabilization in North Africa, compounded by economic collapse,
could trigger an increase in the number of Algerians, Moroccans and Tunisians
seeking asylum in western Europe.</tt><p>
<tt>In Cannes at the end of June, government officials from France, Spain and
Italy persuaded the EU to pledge $6.1 billion in assistance over five years to
North African countries, arguing that economic instability in North Africa was
as threatening to the EU as crime and illegal immigration from Eastern Europe
threatened northern Europe.</tt><p>
<tt>A similar ad package of $8.7 billion was pledged for Eastern Europe.

Smuggling</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>In early July, 18 Sri Lankans were found dead in a locked shipping
container about 20 miles east of the Austrian border, where they had been left
by the driver who was to take them illegally to Germany.  Most had paid from
$800 to $5,000 to be flown to Moscow on 10-day student visas, then taken by
truck and train across Eastern Europe.  The final leg of the journey was in
shipping containers that held 18 to 20 persons each mounted on trucks.</tt><p>
<tt>Many of the Sri Lankans sold assets at home to finance the trip.  Some
reported that they were told they would receive DM10,000 and a job upon their
arrival in Germany.  </tt><p>
<tt>Alien smuggling is believed to be a $1 billion per year business.  In the
first half of this year, Hungarian authorities found more than 4,000 illegal
immigrants and arrested more than 200 human smugglers.  Corresponding figures
for the same period last year were somewhat less than 4,000 illegal  migrants
and 140 immigrant smugglers.</tt><p>
<tt>Polish employment officials estimate that the number of illegal foreign
nationals working the country is more than 100,000.  The State Labour
Inspectorate claims that the figure may be as high as 200,000.  </tt><p>
<tt>Most illegal foreign workers in Poland come from Russia, the Ukraine and
Belarus, but in border towns, there are also illegals from Vietnam, Bulgaria
and Romania, many working as street vendors.</tt><p>
<tt>Since March 1995, Lithuania has tightened controls along its border with
Poland to prevent alien smuggling.  In February, 1995, before the controls, 17
Lithuanian planes flew to Poland with planeloads of refugees.  </tt><p>
<tt>Poland claims that the flights are organized by illegal transport companies
who are moving Asians to the West via Moscow.  Officials expect that with the
tightening of the border with Poland, smugglers will shift their operations to
Belarus and the Ukraine. </tt><p>
<tt>Lithuania became the first of the Baltic countries to adopt a law on
refugees and asylum seekers.  According to the UNHCR, the legislation means
that asylum seekers in Lithuania will no longer be considered illegal migrants,
and they will not face detention or deportation.</tt><p>
<tt>Some estimate that there are 500,000 illegal aliens around Moscow,
20,000</tt><p>
<tt>illegal Chinese aliens warehoused in Prague, 30,000 in Austria and
perhaps</tt><p>
<tt>100,000 in France, most of them bound eventually for the United

<a name="RTFToC20">Philippines
</a></a>Tries to Protect Overseas
Workers</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a> 
</a></h2>
<tt>The Philippine government is fighting the exploitation of its overseas
workers on several fronts.  On July 16, the Migrant Worker and Overseas
Employment Act went in effect.  The Gancayco Commission, formed after the
hanging of a Filipina maid in Singapore, issued its recommendations in
mid-July.  </tt><p>
<tt>Under the new migrant law, overcharging by employment agencies and all
other acts of illegal recruitment are punishable by a jail term from six years
and one day to 12 years, plus a fine of P200,000 to P500,000 (US $ 7,900 to
$20,000).  If three or more persons jointly victimize "three or more persons
individually or as a group," then the crime becomes "economic sabotage," with a
maximum penalty of a life in prison and a fine from P500,000 to P1 million (US
$20,000 to $40,000). </tt><p>
<tt>An alliance of about 500 overseas employment agencies stopped sending
Filipino workers abroad on July 17 to protest the new law.  The employment
agencies say that the regulations are unfair to licensed placement agencies.
Private recruiters are now preparing to ask the Supreme Court to halt the
implementation of the new law. </tt><p>
<tt>The Philippine labor force is about 16 million, and eight million are
reportedly on "labor-only contracts," which makes them dependent on an
employment agency rather than an employer.  Estimates of workers abroad and
remittances vary--most estimate that perhaps four million Filipinos work
abroad, and that their $5 billion annual remittances at least partially support
one-fifth of the population. </tt><p>
<tt>The Gancayco Commission recommended a halt to the deployment of women
migrant workers by the year 2000 to the countries of Saudi Arabia, United Arab
Emirates, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman and Qatar.  After questions were raised about
the constitutionality of a ban on emigration to specific countries, the
commission softened its recommendation to a "travel advisory."  The commission
also recommended a ban on allowing women entertainers, except musicians and
artists, to travel for employment to Japan, Greece and Cyprus. </tt><p>
<tt>Non-government organizations were critical of these recommendations, saying
that prohibiting overseas employment would serve no purpose unless the
government can create jobs at home. </tt><p>
<tt>The commission recommended streamlining and reviewing recruitment
procedures to monitor the number of workers seeking jobs abroad.  Consulates
and immigration officers were told to provide maximum assistance to workers
abroad and watch for illegal recruiters.</tt><p>
<tt>The Philippine legalization program effective June 1995 has attracted only
1,710 applicants.  Government officials estimate that there are 150,000 illegal
aliens in the country.  The program expires at the end of 1996.  Most of the
applicants who have applied for amnesty are from China, Taiwan and India.
</tt><p>
<tt>For about $10,000, a foreigner who entered the country illegally before
June 20, 1992 can acquire permanent residency status.  Once his stay has been
legalized, he can be naturalized as a Filipino citizen in five years, half the
usual time.  The government expects about $78.2 million to be generated from
the program. </tt><p>
<tt>President Ramos said on July 19 that the country plans to normalize
relations with Singapore, which soured following the hanging of a Filipina maid
in April.</tt><p>
<tt>The Philippines, sometimes dismissed as the "sick man of Asia," embarked on
an ambitious Philippines 2000 plan to close the gap with its fast-growing Asian
neighbors over the next five years.  </tt><p>
<tt>One strategy for creating jobs for the 800,000 workers join the labor force
every year is to promote foreign investment in free trade zones, that in early
1995 employed about 200,000 Filipinos, three-fourths of them women.  In most of
these factories, workers are paid the minimum wage of 138 pesos (US $ 5.40) per
day.</tt><p>

</a></h2>
<tt>Taiwan's Council of Labor Affairs announced that, after the country joins
the World Trade Organization, foreign workers will be put on the same footing
as local workers.  Currently, the CLA sets a minimum wage that employers must
pay to foreign workers that is typically less than the wage paid to local
workers.</tt><p>
<tt>The CLA asserted that the number of foreign workers imported will be cut in
half unless the employers and foreign labor agents take responsibility for the
growing number of runaway foreign laborers.</tt><p>
<tt>Taiwan's National Police Administration reported that 10,000 foreign
workers--about five percent of the 220,000 foreign workers in the country--
have abandoned their legal jobs, either to switch to a higher-wage job than
they were assigned at entry, or because their two-year work permits were about
to expire.  Runaways are expected to increase as the two-year work permits
granted to them in 1993 expire.  In 1992, Taiwan required some foreign workers
to depart, including some who had been legally in the country for more than
five years.</tt><p>
<tt>The Council is considering bypassing employment recruiters and having
employers hire workers directly from foreign countries.  It is also considering
an increase in the current maximum three-year prison term for illegal alien
workers.  In July, the government set up two telephone hotlines for local
people to report runaway foreign workers.</tt><p>
<tt>There are estimated to be at least 25,000 illegal alien workers in Taiwan,
making illegals equivalent to about 10 percent of legal workers.  The Ministry
of Justice announced on June 19 a crackdown of Chinese overstayers, many of
whom work in construction.  The immigration department will also try to deter
illegal entrants who sail from the Chinese mainland or enter through a third
country such as Macao or Vietnam.</tt><p>
<tt>On July 14, the Council of Labor Affairs announced that more than 4,000
foreign workers would be allowed into Taiwan to work in six manufacturing
industries.  COLA statistics showed that the manufacturing industries had an
employment shortfall of some 86,000 workers in 1993, and that number had
dropped to 63,000 as of September of 1994.</tt><p>

</a></h2>
<tt>The Malaysian government says it is losing about US $960 million dollars a
year in foreign exchange because of remittances by foreign workers.  The
government estimates that each of the nearly one million foreign workers sends
home about $80 US per month. [In Lebanon, 700,000 foreign workers, mostly
Syrians, earn an estimated 20 percent of that nation's income.]</tt><p>
<tt>The Malaysian government warned that the country's reliance on foreign
labor in only temporary, and the deputy home minister claimed that the presence
of over one million foreign workers is a serious threat to security.</tt><p>
<tt>On July 15 the government extended for another two years the three-year
work permits of foreign workers in construction, manufacturing, and hotels and
restaurants.  The decision to extend the passes was criticized by some unions,
but praised by the construction industry.  </tt><p>
<tt>The Malaysian Trades Union Congress cited examples of abuse of foreign
workers and demanded that the government prevent further mistreatment. </tt><p>
<tt>The government will continue to allow gas stations to have two foreign
workers for every Malaysian employed, although the industry had requested more.
Five-year work passes for plantation workers will continue to be issued.  The
government stopped issuing work passes for foreign caddies at golf courses, but
employers can continue to use foreign caddies until their current work permits
expires.  </tt><p>
<tt>The Malaysian Home Ministry warned foreign workers that they face a maximum
fine of M$300 (US $ 123) or court action if they illegally change jobs.  Many
foreign workers have work permits restricting them to work as maids, and they
have been found to be working illegally in restaurants, grocery stores, offices
and in entertainment.  Employers face of maximum fine of M$10,000 (US $4,000)
or five years' imprisonment or both upon conviction.</tt><p>
<tt>The Bangladeshi government is concerned about the large number of illegal
Bangladeshi workers in Malaysia, and plans to try to curb illegal labor
exports. Bangladesh's labor exports to Malaysia slowed down in recent months as
the Malaysian government discussed new policies to curb the influx of illegal
foreign workers.  </tt><p>
<tt>As of June, 1995, a total of 161,067 Bangladeshis were employed in Malaysia
with valid documents, while 60,000 to 70,000 Bangladeshi labors are believed to
be working illegally.  Of these, about 26,000 are to be legalized.  About 3,200
Bangladeshi illegal workers are being held in Malaysian detention camps.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC23">Surplus
of Chinese Farmers</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a> 
</a></h2>
<tt>The Chinese vice premier says that China will face major social and
political problems if it does not find work for the nearly 200 million farmers
who will be unemployed by the year 2000.  Of the 120 million current surplus
farmers, nearly 80 million have already left farm work for urban areas.  Though
the farmers have helped meet the current urban labor shortages, they are blamed
for increased crime, overcrowded transport system and a rise in birth rate.
</tt><p>
<tt>Two Chinese economists have called on the government to change the
household registration system to make it easier for farmers to move to the
cities, where they earn money to send home and learn skills.  In the first six
months of 1995, the average rural resident earned US$ 91, while his urban
cousin earned US$ 237, official figures show.</tt><p>
<tt>A July 9 front-page editorial in the People's Daily said that the rural
exodus of peasants seeking work in cities is straining urban facilities and
causing labor shortages in rural areas.  The editorial coincided with the
opening of a national conference on migrants.  </tt><p>
<tt>In order to stem the flow of farmers to the cities, the newspaper urged the
government to strengthen agricultural production and develop small township
enterprises to provide other sources of employment.</tt><p>
<tt>The State Bureau of Foreign Experts is trying to resolve disputes between
foreign experts and their Chinese employers.  Such disputes often arise when
Chinese employers do not live up to contract terms involving air
transportation, pay, and working and living conditions.  Some foreign experts
demand more holidays and sometimes leave their jobs without notice. </tt><p>
<tt>China employs about 30,000 foreign experts each year, 30 percent of whom
work for universities, publishing houses, research institutes and hospitals.
</tt><p>
<tt>Tibet's Dali Lama has claimed that thousands of ethnic Han Chinese
immigrants are streaming into Tibet as part of a Chinese plan to overwhelm the
local Tibetan population.  </tt><p>
<tt>The vice-chair of the regional Tibetan government counters that there are
18,000 Han working in Tibet, accounting for less than 30 percent of the workers
employed by the government.  Most of the workers will return to their home
provinces when they reach 30 years of age.</tt><p>
<tt>Tibet has a population of two million.  Han visitors are not permitted to
become citizens of Lhasa or rural farmers.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC24">Hong
Kong Unemployment</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>High rent and labor costs are driving many unskilled jobs to China.  Hong
Kong officials, accustomed to full employment, were shocked when unemployment
hit an eight-year high of three percent in May.  The government, which has
traditionally taken a hands-off approach, has stepped up its efforts to help
service workers find jobs. </tt><p>
<tt>In June, paging operator companies received permission to service calls
from southern China, where wages are only $260 per month, instead of $1,100 per
month in Hong Kong.  Industry analysts expect the entire paging industry to
move to China, a loss of 30,000 Hong Kong jobs.</tt><p>
<tt>An estimated 10 percent of Hong Kong's six million residents have taken out
citizenship or the right to citizenship in another country as a protection for
their families if the 1997 transition to Chinese rule is bumpy. </tt><p>
<tt>Hong Kong's minority groups with no travel documents except the British
Dependent Territories Citizen papers or a British National Overseas passport
are entitled to neither Chinese nor British nationality.  These minority groups
have no nationality or guaranteed right of abode; they can only remain in Hong
Kong as long as the Chinese allow them to remain.  </tt><p>
<tt>Many are Indians who expected the British government to welcome them to
Britain but, as 1997 approaches, they are not being granted British
nationality.  They have lobbied British Members of Parliament for 10 years,
hoping to get special consideration for British passports.  </tt><p>
<tt>The success rate for minorities applying for British passports is about 60
percent, the same for the rest of the population--despite promises from the
British government that the applications from non-Chinese would be only a
fraction of the total.  Many minorities say they want British passports, not to
go the Britain, but to stay in Hong Kong.  They also want an escape should
things go wrong after the Chinese gain control of Hong Kong in 1997. </tt><p>
<tt>The UNHCR director warned that there is a possibility that Vietnamese boat
people who do not return to their native home before the 1997 handover of Hong
Kong, may be sent to re-education camps or jails on the Chinese mainland.  In
July, 1995, there were two incidents when some of the 22,000 Vietnamese being
detained in Hong Kong escaped.  Most were recaptured. </tt><p>
<tt>The escalation of housing prices in Hong Kong has made the average
middle-class apartment in Hong Kong worth more than the minimum investment
required to enter most countries under their business immigration policies.
</tt><p>
<tt>Increasingly, Filipina maids in Hong Kong are working outside the home, a
violation of their employment contracts.  About 600 of the maids claim they are
forced to work in violation of their labor contract by their employers.  Last
year, over 160 Filipinas were charged with unapproved employment. This year the
numbers are expected to be significantly higher.  The Labor and Immigration
Departments encourage domestic workers to report their employers, but the
Filipina maids fear losing their jobs, being jailed, and then deported. </tt><p>

</a></h2>
<tt>The Singapore government announced that, after August 1, white-collar
foreign workers and their employers could no longer contribute to the country's
national pension fund.  After numerous complaints, the government reconsidered
and allowed foreigners already in Singapore to continue making tax-exempt
contributions to the Central Provident Fund until December 1998.  Foreign
workers complained that the proposal would have reduced their wages by an
estimated 20 percent. </tt><p>
<tt>Companies and employees must each make a contribution of 20 percent of
their wage to the CPF.  Expatriate workers can only withdraw money from the
fund when their Singapore contract expires.  Under the old plan, contributions
were tax exempt, but under the new rules, contributions after 1998 will be
considered voluntary, and therefore subject to tax. </tt><p>
<tt>About 300,000 work permit holders are already exempt from making pension
payments under Singapore's Foreign Worker Levy Scheme.  Foreign maids and
construction workers are excluded from the pension plan. </tt><p>

illegal workers who arrived with tourist visas and failed to depart, according

<tt>South Africa is a nation bordered by impoverished neighbors.  The per
capita income in South Africa is $2,560 compared to Mozambique's $80 and $650
in Zimbabwe.  </tt><p>
<tt>The South African army estimates that the number of illegal immigrants in
the country is about five million (12 percent of the population), but admits
that there could be as many eight million (20 percent). Many of the  illegal
immigrants are from Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Lesotho, and many who work in
sugarcane or on cotton farms.  In the first five months of 1995, the army
captured 2,247 illegal immigrants crossing the border without documents.</tt><p>
<tt>The South African government is reluctant to offend neighboring countries
who sheltered many of those escaping apartheid.  At the same time, resentment
against illegal immigrants in South Africa is rising.  The Johannesburg-based
Center for Policy Studies reported that a majority of South Africans hold
illegal immigrants responsible for the nation's high unemployment rate,
homelessness, and other social problems. </tt><p>

quotas, and still others call for the development of impoverished neighboring
states to remove the economic incentive to leave. </tt><p>
<tt>The South African police report that Swaziland has become a major avenue
for illegal immigrants to enter South Africa.  A Swazi syndicate is providing
false documents that illegal immigrants use to get into the country.  Many of
the illegal aliens arrested told border police that controls are tighter along
the Mozambican border than the Swazi border.</tt><p>
<tt>The South African army is urging the government step up the voltage on a
fence that runs between the Mozambique border and South Africa's Kruger
National Park to Swaziland<b> </b>to prevent illegal entry.  South Africa in
1990 changed the setting on the electric fences on its borders from lethal
shocks to a setting that provides only a mild shock.  </tt><p>
<tt>The fence was originally erected to make crossings by guerrillas of the
African National Congress more hazardous from 1986 to 1989.  Human rights
groups argue that the fence will not stop illegal immigration. </tt><p>

<tt>DOL's ILAB has released a report that tabulates employment data on
foreign-and native-born adults in the US in March 1994.  There were 22 million
foreign-born adults and 179 million native-born adults, so that foreign-born
persons were 11 percent of the US adult population. </tt><p>
<tt>The 13 million foreign-born adults in the US labor force in March 1994 were
10 percent of the 130 million strong labor force.</tt><p>
<tt>Foreign-born adults were less likely to be in the labor force than
native-born adults (13 of 22 million or 59 percent of the foreign born, and 117
of 179 million or 65 percent of the native born); the gap for foreign-born
women was especially large.  Foreign-born adults were also more likely to be
unemployed than the native-born (9.2 percent for the foreign-born, and 6.8
percent for the native born).</tt><p>
<tt>Foreign-born adults have a much different education distribution than
native-born adults--the foreign-born are more likely to have a college degree
or more, OR to have less than a ninth- grade education, than are native born
adults. If foreign-born adults are arrayed by their years of education, the
result is an hourglass shape, reflecting their concentration at the extremes of
the education distribution.  Native-born adults, by contrast, generate a
diamond-shaped distribution.</tt><p>
<tt>The contrast between foreign-and native-born adults is sharpest in
agriculture--only five percent of the self-employed farmers are foreign-born,
versus 26 percent of the wage and salary farm workers.  Most of the
foreign-born adult farm workers were Hispanics from Mexico--Hispanics were 50
percent of the foreign-born adults in the US, and 86 percent of the
foreign-born farm workers.  About 72 percent of the foreign-born farm workers,
versus eight percent of the native born farm workers--had less than nine years
of schooling.</tt><p>
<tt>Over half of the foreign-born farm workers were in California, versus six
percent of the native-born farm workers.  The CPS, which asks about employment
in March, does not include most of the foreign-born farm workers--many are not
employed in March, and others arrive in April and May and stay in the US only
until September or October.   </tt><p>
<tt>About five percent of the foreign-born workers were employed by federal,
state, or local governments, versus almost 20 percent of the native-born labor
force.  About 10 percent of both the foreign-born and the native-born were
self-employed.</tt><p>
<tt>Foreign- and native- born adults have very different industry and
occupational distributions.  In nine broad industrial sectors, foreigners are
disproportionately represented in agriculture and manufacturing, and
under-represented in mining, transportation, and public administration.
</tt><p>
<tt>Foreign-born adults are more likely to have farming or operative/laborer or
service occupations than the native born, 47 percent versus 31 percent, and
less likely to have the most common US occupation--technical, sales, or
support.</tt><p>
<tt>There are significant differences in foreign-born and native-born workers
by industry and occupation.  For example, 63 percent of those employed in
California agriculture are foreign born, versus 13 percent of those employed in
New York agriculture in March 1994.</tt><p>
<tt>There are almost 100 million "families" in the US, and about nine million
are headed by foreign-born persons.  There are significantly more husband-wife
households among the foreign born (70 percent) than among the native born (53
percent), but the foreign-born husband-wife families had much lower 1993
incomes, $32,000 versus $43,000.  </tt><p>
<tt>In the states with the most foreign-born persons, one-fourth of all
foreign-born families had incomes in 1993 that were below the poverty
line.</tt><p>
<tt>NB.  In late July, the House voted to reduce ILAB's funding by 86 percent,
which may wipe out the US Department of Labor's $700,000 per year immigration
research program.  ILAB supported the collection of data on IRCA-legalized
aliens (Westat survey), and has supported research of many aspects of the labor
market effects of immigration.  </tt><p>

<tt>The OECD in June 1995 released Trends in International Migration:  1994
Annual Report, which found that immigration flows into OECD nations stabilized
in 1993 and 1994 as a result of changes in asylum systems, and changes in
immigration countries entry criteria.  The report expressed the hope that, with
fewer entries, OECD countries could turn their attention to integrating
newly-arrived immigrants and their children.</tt><p>
<tt>The report emphasizes that economic recovery or labor shortages in the
immigration countries, or recession and instability in emigration counties,
could increase migration again.  The report seemed to endorse more immigration,
noting that Canada, Germany and the United States had increased immigration
since 1988 without noticeable negative economic effects.</tt><p>
<tt>The OECD report identifies three key migration trends--fewer asylum
seekers, more unskilled temporary foreign workers, and more highly-skilled
migrants.</tt><p>
<tt>According to the report, the 1993 foreign populations in European countries
ranged from 6.9 million in Germany to 3.6 million in France to two million in
the UK and 1.3 million in Switzerland.  About half of the foreigners in each of
these countries were in the labor force:  Germany had 3.4 million foreign
workers; France 1.5 million; the UK, 1 million; and Switzerland, 700,000 (in
some cases, temporary or seasonal foreign workers are included, although the
foreign population data refer only to settlers).</tt><p>
<tt>In 1993, Germany took 990,000 foreigners, including 320,000 asylum seekers.
Half of the asylum-seekers arriving in OECD countries in 1993 were from Europe,
usually from former Yugoslavia, Romania and Turkey.  In 1993, Germany
recognized four percent of asylum applicants as refugees, Belgium, Italy and
Norway recognized about 10 percent; France, 28 percent; and Canada, 50
percent.</tt><p>
<tt>In April 1995, Eurostat published a report entitled "International
Migration in the EU Member States - 1992" that put net immigration into the
15-member EU at 1.2 million in 1992.  Net immigration to the EU was close to
zero in 1984, reached 1 million in 1990, and may have peaked in 1992.
According to Eurostat, net immigration to Europe is increasing as immigration
flows rise and emigration remains stable.  </tt><p>
<tt>Most immigrants to EU member nations are Europeans--from 60 to 90 percent
in all EU nations except Sweden where less than half of the immigrants are from
Europe.</tt><p>
<tt>For example, Germany in 1992 had 1.5 million immigrant arrivals, and
720,000 emigrant departures, according to Eurostat.  Germany received
two-thirds of the immigrant arrivals to the EU in 1992, and accounted for 60
percent of the EU's emigrants.</tt><p>
<tt>Immigrants in these data include returning citizens.  In Denmark, Greece,
Spain, Ireland and the United Kingdom, half of all 1992 "immigrants" are
returning citizens.</tt><p>

<tt>The number of foreign-born residents in the US reached a 50-year high of
8.7 percent in 1994, while the number of immigrants admitted to the US fell
nine percent between 1993 and 1994, from 880,000 to 798,400, largely because
special programs for Amerasian children and Indochinese and Soviet refugees
ended in 1993.  </tt><p>
<tt>The share of the foreign-born in the US population has almost doubled from
the 1970 level of 4.8 percent.  The foreign-born share of the US population
peaked at 14.7 percent in 1910.</tt><p>
<tt>There were 23 million foreign born residents in the US in 1994, meaning
that almost one in 11 Americans was born in another country.  About 31 percent
of these foreign-born residents have become naturalized US citizens.</tt><p>
<tt>An estimated four million foreign-born residents, or 17 percent-- are in
the US illegally.  Mexico was the country of birth for 27 percent of the
foreign-born, and Hispanics were 46 percent of the foreign-born.  </tt><p>
<tt>The foreign-born are concentrated in a few states.  California had 7.7
million foreign-born residents in 1994, meaning that almost 25 percent of the
state's population was born abroad; New York, 2.9 million, or 16 percent
foreign born; and Florida, 2.1 million--these three states had 55 percent of
all the immigrants.</tt><p>
<tt>There were over six million persons born in Mexico and living in the US in
1994, one million persons born in the Philippines, 850,000 born in Cuba, and
700,000 each born in El Salvador and Canada.  The next major countries of
origin were US residents born in Germany--600,000--and then five countries that
are each home to about 500,000 US residents--China, Dominican Republic, South
Korea, Vietnam and India. </tt><p>
<tt>About 20 percent of all foreign-born residents arrived in the last five
years--the foreign-born population increased by 4.5 million between 1990 and
1994.  Those who arrived since 1990 are almost twice as likely to receive
public assistance as US-born residents--almost six percent of the
recently-arrived foreign born, versus three percent of 1990-94 immigrants,
received some form of public assistance in 1994.  About one-fourth of the
immigrants who arrived recently have poverty-level incomes, but 40 percent of
recent Mexican immigrants were poor in 1994-- 14 percent of the US born are
poor.</tt><p>
<tt>When ranked by the single best predictor of income, years of immigration,
recent immigrants have a barbell or hourglass shape.  About 21 percent of
post-1990 immigrants have a college degree or more, compared with 15 percent of
US born adults.</tt><p>
<tt>The number of family unification immigrants fell six percent between 1993
and 1994, from 484,000 to 464,000.  There were 107,000 immigrants from Mexico,
making Mexicans about one in eight immigrants in 1994.  The backlog for family
unification immigration worldwide was about three million.</tt><p>
<tt>The number of immigrants admitted for employment reasons fell 16 percent,
from 147,000 in FY 93 to 123,300 in FY 94.  The unused employment visas will
permit more family immigration in FY95.</tt><p>
<tt>As in previous years, about one-third of the legal immigrants in 1993 were
students, and another 30 percent were unemployed, retired or homemakers.  There
were more than twice as many laborers and service workers (120,000) as managers
and professionals (45,000).</tt><p>

<tt>A federal-state task force raided a garment factory in Los Angeles and
found 70 Thai immigrants living and working in a fenced seven-unit apartment
complex that they could not leave.  According to the workers, most worked 84
hours weekly sewing garments for wages that averaged $1.60 per hour, far less
than California's $4.25 minimum hourly wage.  The workers had the cost of
smuggling them to the US deducted from their pay.</tt><p>
<tt>The apartment complex's owner as well as neighbors said they did not
suspect that the fenced apartment complex was an illegal sweatshop that held
workers inside against their will.  The nine Thai operators and guards at the
complex have been charged with a variety of immigration and labor law
violations that carry penalties of up to $3 million and 30 years in jail;
$750,000 in cash and gold was found in the factory, some of which may be used
to pay workers who were not paid the minimum wage to which they were
entitled.</tt><p>
<tt>The Thai workers were granted six-month temporary work permits so they can
support themselves until they appear as witnesses in the trial of sweatshop
operators.  After the trial, they are supposed to be deported back to
Thailand.</tt><p>
<tt>California labor authorities subpoenaed records from two department store
chains, Mervyn's and Wards, to determine if they knowingly dealt with the
unregistered factory, which did business as SK Fashions.  It is illegal to
operate a sewing factory in a residence.  The stores may be liable for back
wages, since SK was an unregistered contractor.</tt><p>
<tt>California Governor Wilson attacked the Clinton Administration for not
cracking down on sweatshops that employ illegal immigrants.</tt><p>
<tt>In 1994, Governor Wilson vetoed a bill which would have automatically made
the beneficiaries of work done in sweatshops liable for labor law violations
committed there.  According to Wilson, "it is plainly inequitable to hold
manufacturers liable for the acts of separate and independent businesses when
they have no control over their actions."  </tt><p>
<tt>A California Senate committee reapproved the bill that would make garment
manufacturers liable for the labor law violations by a 4 to 3 committee vote on
August 30.  Farm worker advocates and others concerned about vulnerable
immigrant workers have been seeking to have the beneficiaries of the immigrant
workers labor be liable for the labor and immigration violations of their
subcontractors.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS investigated the factory in 1992, but the local federal attorney
refused to ask a court to issue a search warrant, so the INS did not pursue its
investigation.  The federal judge to whom the case was first assigned has
indicated that she will probably step aside because she was a federal
prosecutor when the federal attorney's office in 1992 decided not to search the
complex.  California labor law officials eventually investigated and discovered
the Thai workers being held against their will.</tt><p>
<tt>There were 19,000 ethnic Thais in Los Angles County, according to the 1990
COP, but there may be more immigrants from Thailand among those who identified
themselves as ethnic Chinese even though they immigrated from Thailand.</tt><p>
<tt>The publicity generated by the sweatshop raid in Thailand is allegedly
encouraging more illegal Thai immigration to the US.  The raid and prosecution
has bee widely publicized in Thailand, where officials report that "It sounds
pretty good to Thai people to stay in a room with a spring bed, instead of a
mat, and with air conditioning."  </tt><p>
<tt>The wages paid in the sweatshop, reported in Thailand to be about $15 for a
10 hour day, are "pretty good by Thai standards."  Thais interviewed in
Thailand hoping to migrate to the US reportedly "don't believe things are that
bad."  The Thai Office for the Protection of Thai Nationals Abroad was not
greatly concerned about the Los Angeles sweatshop, and Thai authorities are
reportedly not actively helping the INS to investigate the Thai end of the
case.</tt><p>
<tt>The minimum wage for the 1.2 million garment workers in Thailand is $6 per
day, but many women reportedly work 16-hour days for $3 to $4.  The fact that
it was falsely reported in Thailand the Thai workers were to have "green cards"
until the trial is over has allegedly increased interest in migrating illegally
to the US. </tt><p>
<tt>On August 23, INS agents discovered three more sweatshops, unregistered
factories that employed 56 illegal Asian workers smuggled into the US by Asian
smuggling rings to sew garments for contractors who supply major retailers such
as JC Penny.  In California, garment manufacturing is a $46 billion industry
that involves 4000 legal, and perhaps another 1,000 illegal, workplaces and
125,000 workers.</tt><p>
<tt>Some immigrant worker advocates are concerned that highly publicized raids
will drive garment shops further underground.  The raids have highlighted the
difficulties involved in simultaneously enforcing immigration and labor
laws.</tt><p>
<tt>US Labor Secretary Robert Reich called on major garment retailers to
participate in an industry summit on September 12 in New York to develop
protections for garment workers.  A 1994 study found that over 70 percent of
the nation's garment factories paid at least some of their workers less than
minimum wages, that 80 percent did not pay all of the overtime wages that they
were required to pay, and that 90 percent had health and safety
violations.</tt><p>
<tt>The IRS has begun to crackdown on workers who are paid as independent
contractors so that their employers can avoid payroll taxes that add 10 to 20
percent to wage costs.  Texas A&amp;M admitted on August 15 that it wrongly
paid 400 farm workers employed at 10 of the university's 18 agricultural
experiment stations as independent contractors.</tt><p>
<tt>The IRS estimated in 1987 that almost 4 million of the then 110 million
employed workers in the US were unlawfully being paid as independent
contractors. </tt><p>
<tt>The single most labor-intensive activity in US agriculture is the
harvesting of about 300,000 acres of raisin grapes near Fresno,
California--some 50,000 workers are employed from mid-August to the end of
September to cut bunches of grapes and lay them on paper trays to dry.  The
workers doing this "bottom of the farm job ladder" work are increasingly
non-Spanish speaking Indians from southern Mexico and Guatemala.</tt><p>
<tt>Many of the "new-new" migrants are Mixtec Indians from the southern Mexican
state of Oaxaca.  There may be as many as 50,000 Mixtec Indians in California
and, in a sign of the times, one school district that teaches children in
Spanish hired a non-English speaking teacher's aid to translate between Mixtec
and Spanish.</tt><p>

</a></h2>
<tt>Since immigration affects everything from national sovereignty to concepts
of community and membership, and granting permission to immigrate is a
discretionary act that most of the world's nations do not regularly grant,
immigration policy in the US is an intensely political issue.  </tt><p>
<tt>California Governor Pete Wilson formally launched his bid to be the 1996
Republican presidential candidate on August 28 by using the Statue of Liberty
as a symbolic backdrop to stress his opposition to illegal immigration.
According to Wilson, the Statue of Liberty symbolizes the correct legal way to
immigrate to the US.  Wilson's campaign is based on opposition to illegal
immigration, affirmative action, crime, welfare and taxes.  The Republicans
will hold their nominating convention in San Diego in August 1995.</tt><p>
<tt>Republican presidential candidate Phil Gramm in mid-August received support
for his campaign from Iowa Beef Packers, one of the major US meat packers that
was discovered to be using a contractor who employed illegal aliens in May
1995.  IBP and other midwestern meatpackers slashed wages in the 1980s by
closing unionized plants and building new plants that were staffed with Asian
and Hispanic immigrants.  Base wages, which were $9 per hour in 1982, are now
in the $6 per hour range.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC5">INS:
Apprehensions and Naturalizations
Up</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></h2>
<tt>Apprehensions at the US-Mexican border were up 26 percent to 1 million in
the first 10 months of FY95--there were 815,000 apprehensions in the same
period in FY94.  </tt><p>
<tt>There are two reasons for the increase in apprehensions.  Most observers
point to the peso crisis that began when Mexico devalued the peso on December
20, 1994.  That, in turn, led to soaring interest rates in Mexico, layoffs that
pushed the unemployment rate to 6.6 percent, and a four to six percent
contraction of the Mexican economy in 1995.  </tt><p>
<tt>The US also added 10 percent more Border Patrol agents in FY95, but their
strategy has changed from apprehending as many aliens as possible to deterring
the entry of aliens with fences and walls and a massive presence.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS spent $200 million to detain aliens in 1994, and detention costs
are rising as more aliens are detained, and being detained for longer periods.
Three types of aliens are detained-- "excludable," "deportable," and "criminal
aliens."</tt><p>
<tt>Excludables are stopped when attempting to enter the US, and they can be
paroled into the US, or held until they leave voluntarily, or the INS and
courts determine if they can stay.  Deportable aliens are persons in the US who
have violated the terms of their legal entry, or who entered the US without
inspection.  </tt><p>
<tt>Criminal aliens have been sentenced for crimes committed in the US.  They
are taken into custody after they have served their prison terms, and until
they can be deported--60 percent of the aliens detained by the INS are criminal
aliens.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS believes that detention reduces fraudulent asylum applications.
For example, after persons arriving at John F. Kennedy Airport in New York and
requesting asylum were routinely detained, asylum applications at Kennedy
Airport fell from 15,000 in 1992 to 9,000 in 1994.</tt><p>
<tt>There has been discussion of detaining some of those apprehended crossing
the Mexico-US border with false documents--excludables.  Over 200 aliens per
day were apprehended at the San Diego border crossing using false documents to
try to enter the US "legally."  </tt><p>
<tt>In response to Operation Gatekeeper, some alien smugglers are renting
border crossing and other documents to aliens wishing to enter the US.  To stop
this mode of illegal entry, the INS has announced that false documents will be
seized, and the alien using them detained, and possibly held over for a trial
before an immigration judge.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS is keeping the checkpoints on major roads leaving the border area
open longer, which forces alien smugglers to keep illegal immigrants in
so-called drop houses in the San Diego area longer.  In July, the INS found 66
illegal aliens in a one-bedroom apartment.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS launched Operation Disruption in May 1995 to detect drop houses in
the San Diego area.  Some 117 such houses have been found, and 4,800 aliens
apprehended.  Some 120 smugglers were arrested.  A toll-free number
(1-800-808-USBP) has been established to report suspected drop houses.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS expects to deport 30,000 criminal aliens in FY95.  There are no
data on the number of criminal aliens deported in earlier years.  The INS
stations agents at selected jails, including the Los Angeles County Jail, to
take into custody aliens as they are released.  The 1994 Violent Crime Control
and Law Enforcement Act allows the INS to begin deportation proceedings against
aliens while they are in prison for other crimes, and then to deport them upon
their release.</tt><p>
<tt>In July 1995, there were 29,000 foreign-born inmates in federal
penitentiaries and 72,000 foreign-born people were incarcerated in state
facilities.</tt><p>
<tt>In mid-August, the INS and California officials arrested 116 mostly
Mexicans who had been deported from the US after being convicted of committing
crimes here, and then returned despite deportation.  California had identified
1,200 aliens who were deported by the INS after serving their prison terms, but
who returned illegally, and were being supervised by California parole
authorities.</tt><p>
<tt>Those arrested face up to 20-year federal prison terms for illegally
entering the US after being deported.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS on August 31 announced a "Citizenship USA" program to reduce from
one year to six months the time needed to process citizenship applications.
The number of aliens seeking to become naturalized US citizens rose from an
average 300,000 per year to an expected 1 million in FY95.  The INS hopes the
plan will ease the backlog of 600,000 cases.  </tt><p>
<tt>The "Citizenship USA" program will quadruple the naturalization staff in
the Los Angeles district, increase overtime, purchase new computers, and
increase the use of community organizations to interview potential US citizens.
The program will concentrate on the cities of Los Angeles, Miami, New York,
Chicago and San Francisco, where 75 percent of all naturalization applications
are filed.  </tt><p>
<tt>The INS may also waive personal interviews in some cases. </tt><p>
<tt>A study release in August showed that, although there was a 225 percent
increase in citizenship applications in the last five years, Congress decreased
the Naturalization Division's budget by 35 percent. </tt><p>

</a></h2>
<tt>In January 1995, the INS announced that the 200,000 Salvadorans living in
the US with a Temporary Protected Status (TPS) would have to obtain another US
immigration status or leave the US by September 30, 1995<b>. </b> On August 3,
the INS extended until January 31, 1996 the time that the estimated 90,000
Salvadorans with Deferred Enforced Departure, who are eligible under a consent
decree to apply for asylum, but have not yet done so, have to file their asylum
applications or otherwise change their status from TPS or leave the US.</tt><p>
<tt>Salvadoran TPS is a legacy of Reagan administration policies in Central
America.  As Nicaraguans and Salvadorans came to the US, about 80 percent of
the Nicaraguans, but less than five percent of the Salvadorans, were granted
asylum in the US.  A class action suit against the INS, the so-called ABC case,
was settled in 1991 by granting 200,000 Salvadorans TPS as well as work permits
until the INS thoroughly reviewed their requests for asylum.</tt><p>
<tt>Even Salvadoran activists conceded that few of the Salvadorans in the US
are likely to be granted asylum.  Their hope is that, as years pass, many
Salvadorans will be able to prove that returning them to El Salvador would
impose an extreme hardship on them.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS announced that beginning October 9, 1995, Canadians and Mexicans
who apply for border crossing and similar cards will have to pay processing
fees of $4 to $32.</tt><p>

<tt>The debates over affirmative action and immigration are slowly being merged
in US politics, especially in local disputes.</tt><p>
<tt>In New York, traditionally a bastion of support for immigrants, there have
been disputes about residency requirements to attend local schools. Hempstead,
a mostly Black school district in 1984, now has one-fourth Hispanic students,
and non-Spanish speaking registrars are requiring non-English speaking parents
to provide leases and similar evidence that they live in the school
district.</tt><p>
<tt>However, since some of the parents are illegal aliens who sublet rooms in
apartments from family and friends, they have no written leases to prove that
they and their children live in the district.  As a result, some children are
not in school despite the 1982 US Supreme Court Plyler v Doe decision, which
prohibited states from denying illegal alien children free K-12 public
education.  The courts have not yet decided whether local residency
requirements are a form of prohibited discrimination against immigrants.</tt><p>
<tt>New York Mayor Giuliani criticized Republican party leaders who are pushing
for tighter controls over illegal immigration.  Under an executive order
approved in 1985, and still in force, New York officials are required to
provide city services to unauthorized aliens, and are prohibited from providing
information on suspected illegal aliens to the INS.  There are an estimated
40,000 to 60,000 children with illegal alien parents in New York public
schools.</tt><p>
<tt>One of the first challenges for many immigrants to the US is to secure a
driver's license.  Many immigrants from countries such as Vietnam or China have
never driven a car.  In immigrant areas, so many established immigrants have
set up driving schools that offer native language instruction that English-only
driving schools outside public schools are reportedly rare.</tt><p>
<tt>A July USA Today/Gallup poll of immigrants who could respond to questions
in English found that 85 percent were or wanted to become US
citizens--two-thirds of those polled were already naturalized US citizens, and
almost 60 percent of the non-citizens planned to naturalize (August MN).  Only
about one-third of the foreign-born in the US are naturalized US
citizens.</tt><p>
<tt>The USA Today/Gallup poll also found that most immigrants are well
integrated into American life, and that more immigrants than US-born persons,
93 versus 85 percent, believe in the American dream, i.e., hard work pays
off.</tt><p>

</a></h2>
<tt>The International Monetary Fund in August issued a report that blamed
Mexicans, not foreigners, for selling pesos and causing the pesos to lose half
its value.  Ex-President Salinas is blamed for failing to devalue the peso in a
timely fashion, thereby permitting imports to greatly exceed exports, and
producing the peso crisis of December 1994.</tt><p>
<tt>A bailout in March 1995 stabilized the peso, and Mexico has spent about
half of the $50 billion provided by the US and the IMF to pay off the maturing
bonds.  Severe belt tightening since then has so far not produced a populist
revolt against the government.</tt><p>
<tt>Mexico is expected to run a $5 to $6 billion trade surplus in 1995, and
foreign investors looking to the long run are reportedly sending investments to
Mexico.  However, only 20 percent of small and mid-sized US companies in one
survey are planning to do more business in Mexico next year, down from 33
percent in a 1994 survey.  The economy is expected to shrink by three to four
percent in 1995, and grow by two percent in 1996.</tt><p>
<tt>Many analysts say that turning around the Mexican economy will be hard
because the Mexican savings rate is so low--savings averaged only about 14
percent of national income over the past decade, versus 20 percent for
countries at a similar stage of development.</tt><p>
<tt>Baja California may replace Juarez as the major center of maquiladora
activity in Mexico, largely because NAFTA encouraged especially Japanese firms
to expand the number of 1,000-plus factories in Tijuana and Mexicali.
Baja-area maquiladoras have increased their exports by one third, and their
employment by nearly 20 percent.  While it is easy for internal Mexican
migrants to find jobs in Baja maquiladoras , it is hard for them to find
affordable housing. </tt><p>
<tt>In his first state of the nation speech on September 1, President Zedillo
promised to support legislation that would give Mexican congressional
committees the power to investigate the activities of the President and the
executive branch of government.  Zedillo spent most of his speech acknowledging
Mexico's economic difficulties, including the loss of at least 824,000 jobs so
far in 1995, but asserted that economic growth would resume in 1996.</tt><p>
<tt>President Zedillo's June 1995 proposal to permit Mexicans to be nationals
of Mexico and another country, and retain their Mexican passports and property
rights, but not voting rights in Mexico, is moving toward an expected Fall 1995
approval.  Mexico's PRI opposes voting rights for Mexican nationals abroad, for
fear that they will vote for the opposition.</tt><p>
<tt>Article 37 of Mexico's 1917 Constitution distinguishes between citizenship
or allegiance to a country and birth nationality, and asserts that Mexicans who
voluntarily become citizens of another country lose Mexican citizenship.  If
approved by a two-thirds vote as expected in September by Mexico's Congress,
and then by a majority of Mexico's 31 state legislatures, Mexicans in the US
could become dual nationals in about one year.  About 50 nations permit dual
citizenship. </tt><p>

to Immigration
Proposals</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></h2>
<tt>Both the Commission on Immigration Reform and Rep. Lamar Smith's (R-TX)
Immigration in the National Interest Act (HR 2202) would eliminate several
preferences that currently permit naturalized US citizens to bring their
extended families to the US.  </tt><p>
<tt>The reduced number of immigration slots for extended family members would
be offset, for at least five years, by adding slots for the immediate family
members of legal immigrants to enter the US.  Smith's Immigration in the
National Interest Act, and Sen. Alan Simpson's Immigration Control and
Financial Responsibility Act (S 269), have cleared the respective
subcommittees.  </tt><p>
<tt>Because of national interest in immigration and bipartisan support, the
bills are expected to move quickly through the House and Senate.  The biggest
battles are expected to be over how much to reduce legal immigration, and how
strictly to regulate immigrant and other workers' access to the US labor
market.</tt><p>
<tt>One effect of these proposed changes in US immigration law would be to add
close family slots that are typically used by Mexicans and Latin Americans to
enter the US, and reduce the number of extended family unification slots often
used by Asians to immigrate.  Asian groups have led the charge against the
proposed elimination of slots for adult children and brothers and sisters of US
citizens 21 and older--1.3 million or 54 percent of the 2.4 million persons on
immigration waiting lists are reportedly from Asia, including 500,0000 from the
Philippines (Asia has 60 percent of the world's population).  </tt><p>
<tt>According to some Asians, the proposed changes in the family unification
system are unfair, since the extended family members in Asia have been waiting
to immigrate legally, while many of the Mexicans who would benefit from extra
slots to eliminate the backlog for the unification of immediate families had
family members who came to the US illegally, and then received an
amnesty.</tt><p>
<tt>Both the Senate and House bills would increase the size of the Border
Patrol, and add INS and labor inspectors to enforce employer sanctions.  The
House dropped a provision that would have permitted the federal government to
seize the assets of employers who habitually hire illegal aliens, and added a
provision that permits the use of testers to determine if an employer is
discriminating against ethnic minorities.</tt><p>
<tt>Farm employers are worried about the additional enforcement resources,
fearing that their enactment might lead to farm labor shortages.  Neither bill
includes an agricultural guest worker program, although Rep Gallegly (R-CA) and
Senator Kyl (R-AZ) have indicated that they will propose such a program when
the full Judiciary committees consider immigration legislation this
fall.</tt><p>
<tt>The Clinton administration is considering a proposal that would give
special immigration status to Vietnamese in Southeast Asian refugee camps.  The
measure must be approved by Vietnam and would expand the Lautenberg Amendment,
which gives preferential treatment to Soviet Jews and others.  </tt><p>
<tt>Under the plan, refugees would be guaranteed a review of their application
for refugee resettlement in the US if they return to Vietnam from camps in Hong
Kong, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines.  About 41,000 refugees
would be eligible for a review under this plan, although it is unknown how many
would be allowed to eventually come to the US.  Most have had their
applications for recognition as refugees eligible for resettlement rejected.

<tt>In Los Angeles County, almost two-thirds of persons who receive SSI and
Medicaid are legal immigrants.  Some say that immigrant elderly are dependent
on these federal programs because they arrived so late in life in the US, e.g.,
in their 50s and 60s, so that they had too little US work history to accrue US
pension rights.  </tt><p>
<tt>If the federal government eliminates welfare eligibility for legal
immigrants, counties such as Los Angeles fear that they may have to pick up the
cost of supporting poor immigrants, so they asked the California state
government for permission to deny benefits to legal immigrants as well.</tt><p>
<tt>Under House proposals, legal aliens over 75 who have resided in the United
States for at least five years will remain eligible for federal benefits, as
will refugees who have been in the US less than five years.  The US-sponsors of
immigrants would be legally liable to support the immigrants whom they
petitioned to bring into the US.</tt><p>
<tt>Los Angeles county has about 10 million residents, and one-third of the
non-elderly residents did not have health insurance in 1992--elderly residents
are covered by the federal Medicare program.  Another 20 percent of the
non-elderly population is covered by MediCal, a federal-state program that
provides health care for poor people.  </tt><p>
<tt>Faced with a $1.2 billion county deficit for 1995-96, half of which came
from health care, Los Angeles proposed closing the county hospital, one of the
largest employers in a poor section of the city/county.  The proposed shutdown
generated protests from residents who depended on the complex for jobs, and
from immigrants who rely on the facility for health care.</tt><p>
<tt>Los Angeles has been fingerprinting applicants for general relief since
1991, and applicants for AFDC since 1994.  In 1995, New York City followed
suit, requiring fingerprints of applicants for Home Relief.  Fingerprints are
taken electronically, with a machine similar to that used by the Border Patrol
to obtain fingerprints from apprehended illegal aliens.  As a result of the
fingerprinting requirement in New York, about five percent of current
recipients are no longer receiving payments.</tt><p>
<tt>The GAO in early September criticized the administrators of the $22 billion
per year Supplemental Security Income program for not doing enough to crack
down on middlemen who, for a fee, help immigrants to feign mental illness so
that they can obtain SSI benefits.  </tt><p>
<tt>The Clinton administration is screening persons who obtain housing
assistance to prevent illegal aliens from receiving housing assistance.
Illegal aliens have been barred from most federal housing programs since 1980,
but final regulations to screen them out of the one million public housing
units nationwide were issued only on June 19, 1995.  Federal housing assistance
is reserved for people who earn less than 50 percent of the median income of an
area.</tt><p>

<tt>Canada is attempting to both reduce the number of immigrants, 200,000 in
1995, and the percentage who arrive because their families sponsor them, 51
percent in 1995.  </tt><p>
<tt>Many refugees in Canada are single men, who become immigrants and apply to
have their families join them--children younger than 19 or students, spouses,
fianc&eacute;s, parents and grandparents.</tt><p>
<tt>In some cases, processing their applications, and receiving refugee status,
requires several years.  Additional time is then necessary to process family
members.  </tt><p>
<tt>Professional immigrants in Canada face high rates of unemployment after
their arrival, and many are on welfare.  According to Statistics Canada, most
new immigrants are visible minorities from Third World countries who have a
higher education level than the Canadian population as a whole but are much
less likely to be employed, particularly in professional jobs.  Employers,
professional immigrants report, demand "Canadian experience," which they do not
have.</tt><p>
<tt>Canada has reduced its annual immigration intake from 250,000 to 210,000 in
1995, but polls indicate that 70 percent of Canadians want immigration cut back
further.    </tt><p>
<tt>Canada also imposed a $975 per immigrant fee on arriving immigrants that is
expected to generate $150 million per year.</tt><p>
<tt>Under a proposal drafted with the help of Vice President Gore's National
Performance Review, the U.S. border with Canada eventually would become an open
border, with no inspections.  If enacted, persons arriving from "low risk"
countries would fly into domestic airport gates, and enter the US without
inspection.  Foreign air travelers would no longer have to provide a US
address, and the forms now required of arriving passengers would be
discontinued.</tt><p>
<tt>The Administration quickly distanced itself from the recommendation,
rejecting the open border concept as "blue-sky thinking."</tt><p>

<tt>Republican Presidential candidate Bob Dole on September 4 announced that he
would support proposals to make English the official language of the US.
According to Dole, English is an important part of the glue that binds
Americans together, and those seeking to become naturalized US citizens should
learn English.   Dole also attacked bilingual education, arguing that schools
should conduct regular classes in English.</tt><p>
<tt>The entire 9th Circuit Court of Appeals also agreed to rehear an earlier
decision by a small group of 9th Circuit Court judges that found Arizona's
official English amendment to be unconstitutional.  US English had filed the
amicus brief earlier this year, arguing that the panel of judges had
misinterpreted the amendment.  A rehearing en banc means that 11 judges of the
9th Circuit will reconsider the issue and decide anew whether the Arizona
amendment is consistent with the US Constitution.</tt><p>
<tt>US English, founded by Sen. S.I. Hayakawa of California, has over 600,000
members devoted to amending the US Constitution to make English the official
language of the US.  According to US English, if English were the official
language, government activities would be conducted in English, except for the
judicial, health, and emergency services, which could use appropriate languages
to carry out their functions.  Some 21 states, and many cities, have made
English their official language.</tt><p>
<tt>The governor of Maryland said he will veto a watered-down version of a bill
that would have made English the official language of Maryland.  In vetoing the
legislation he said that he felt the measure would be "punitive" to non-English
speaking immigrants. </tt><p>
<tt>There are currently five bills in Congress that would make English the
official language of the US and to end public support for bilingual education.
Each of the four bills before the House Committee on Educational and Economic
Opportunity establish English as the nation's official language.</tt><p>

<tt>With the hoped-far end to fighting in the ex-Yugoslavia in August 1995,
many Europeans are anxious to have the 750,000 Serbs, Bosnians, and Croatians
on their territory return to their country of origin--the war produced a total
3.5 million displaced persons, but most remained in the ex-Yugoslavia.</tt><p>
<tt>The big question is how many ex-Yugoslavs can be returned from the six
European states in which most live--Germany, Austria, Denmark, Norway, Sweden,
and Switzerland.  Germany announced it will resume repatriation of Croatian war
refugees in the first week of September because the situation in Croatia has
stabilized.</tt><p>
<tt>Most of the Yugoslavs who left the region after 1992 received Temporary
Protected Status, not a refugee status.  This means that, in theory, when TPS
status is withdrawn, "tolerated" Yugoslavs become illegal aliens subject to
deportation.</tt><p>
<tt>However, in many countries, it is very difficult to get agreement on when
to end TPS status, and then to enforce returns.  For example, in Germany, the
Interior Ministry has declared Turkey safe for Kurdish asylum seekers whose
applications have been rejected, but several SPD-governed states have refused
to deport Kurds.  Several German states have announced that they will not
deport in 1995 any rejected asylum seekers who have lived in Germany eight
years or more.</tt><p>
<tt>It is also not clear if the Bosnian, Serb, and Croatian governments will
punish returning nationals who failed to fulfill their military obligations by
fleeing to Europe.  For example, Sweden is returning war resisters to Serbia,
but Switzerland is not.</tt><p>
<tt>There are about 500,000 Bosnians outside the ex-Yugoslavia, including
300,000 in Germany, 100,000 in Austria, and 50,000 in Sweden.  Perhaps 10
percent of them have Croatian passports, and they may be forced to leave
Germany on September 15, when TPS for Croatians expires.</tt><p>

</a></h2>
<tt>Austria is a country of eight million that includes 10 percent or about
800,000 foreigners.  </tt><p>
<tt>Austria has evolved from a country through which persons seeking asylum
transited to a country of destination for refugees, but Austria changed its
laws and procedures in a way that grants most new arrivals who need protection
TPS rather than refugee status.  </tt><p>
<tt>The number of asylum applications in Austria peaked at 35,000 mostly Poles
in 1981, fell to about 6,000 in the mid-1980s as a result of requiring visas
for Poles, and then rose steadily to top 25,000 in 1991.  Most of the early
1990s asylum applicants were from the ex-Yugoslavia.</tt><p>
<tt>In June 1992, a new asylum law went into effect, and the number of asylum
seekers dropped from 2,000 per month to about 500 per month.  Virtually all
asylum applications are filed as aliens enter Austria.  Most first decisions
are made within one to three months, and final decisions within three to six
months, with less than 10 percent of the applicants eventually granted asylum
in Austria.  </tt><p>
<tt>As in many other European nations, Austria grants TPS rather than refugee
status to the 50,000 to 100,000 persons from the ex-Yugoslavia in the country.
Austria spent about $125 million per year in 1993 and 1994 to care for Yugoslav
TPS residents, and these costs were about 85 percent of Austrian expenditures
on refugees and asylum in 1994.  </tt><p>
<tt>Bosnians seeking TPS must apply at an official border entry post, and are
sent back to any safe country through which they passed en route to Austria to
apply for asylum there.  Austria in June 1995 extended TPS for Bosnians in the
country until June 1996.</tt><p>
<tt>Austria has separate work and residence permit systems, administered by
different agencies, and with separate quotas.  This means that a foreigner can
have a work permit but not be entitled to live in Austria, and vice
versa.</tt><p>
<tt>In Austria, a foreigner can lose a "secure" work permit if his housing
becomes insufficient.  Similarly, the holder of an "unlimited" work permit
valid for five years can lose it if he was unemployed more than half the
time.</tt><p>
<tt>There is a great deal of administrative discretion in handling migration
matters.  For example, courts overturned a case in which a foreigner was not
allowed to naturalize because he had once distributed leaflets to protest his
dismissal from his job--the naturalization authorities rejected his application
on the grounds that he had acted against Austrian interests, while the courts
held that leafleting was merely free speech.</tt><p>
<tt>As in many other European countries, Austrian political parties disagree on
what immigration policy should be.  For example, the Greens argue that rape
should be grounds for granting asylum in Austria, and that family unification
should not be limited by annual quotas.   Instead of quotas, Austria and most
other European countries limit family unification by requiring the established
head of the household to have sufficient income and living space to support
family members wishing to immigrate.</tt><p>
<tt>The Austrian government has come under increasing criticism for its failure
to stop terrorist attacks on Austrians of foreign decent and those who have
spoken out against the growing right wing activities.  The most recent attack
was in mid-June, and the police have not determined who committed the attack.
A Social Democratic-Conservative coalition drafted legislation to give law
enforcement more powers including wiretapping and electronic surveillance.

<tt>The Austrian construction company BAU Holding plans to employ Portuguese
workers in Austria at a lower rate of pay than is paid to Austrian workers.
This is believed to be a violation of Austrian law, which states that foreign
workers must be paid comparable wages if they are employed more than one month
for in Austria.</tt><p>

<tt>Newly-released German data indicate that, in 1994, about seven percent of
the 350,000 asylum applications resulted in the applicant being recognized as a
refugee, about 68 percent of the applications were rejected, and the remaining
25 percent were continued in some manner, such as granting the applicant
temporary protected status (Duldung).  </tt><p>
<tt>During the first six months of 1995, some 58,700 foreigners applied for
asylum in Germany, down about seven percent from 1994 levels.  Almost
one-fourth of the 1995 asylum applications were Turks, and another 25 percent
were from nationals of ex-Yugoslavia.  </tt><p>
<tt>Germany plans to reduce cash payments to asylum seekers by 20 percent, and
to provide more in-kind benefits.</tt><p>
<tt>On July 1, 1995, the backlog of asylum cases waiting for decisions was
75,000, down from 500,000 in July 1993.  Germany forcibly returned 35,000
rejected asylum seekers in 1994, and 12,000 in the first six months of 1995.
Courts differ on whether states can detain foreigners awaiting
deportation.</tt><p>
<tt>The number of aliens apprehended at Germany's borders fell from about
30,000 in 1994, versus 55,000 in 1993.  In the first seven months of 1995, some
8000 aliens were apprehended on the German-Polish border; 52 percent were
Romanians, and an average 60 Romanians are returned to Romania every
day.</tt><p>
<tt>Germany is adding 500 Border agents to the current 4,800 on its eastern
borders with Poland and the Czech Republic.  About 84 percent of the illegal
immigrants were caught along Germany's border with Poland and the Czech
Republic. </tt><p>
<tt>In 1994, right-wing violence in Germany declined, but the number of violent
acts committed by foreigners living in Germany increased.  There were 1,500
right wing violent acts recorded in 1994, and half involved violence against
foreigners.  Foreigners living in Germany committed 262 politically-motivated
violent acts in 1994, up from 195 in 1993.</tt><p>
<tt>After an August wave of firebomb attacks against Turkish businesses in
Germany, the Turkish prime Minister called upon the German government to
provide better protection.</tt><p>
<tt>Interior Minister Kanther, considered a hard-liner on immigration issues,
announced in August that he would support reducing from 15 to 10 years the
residency requirement to apply for naturalization.  If foreigners wishing to
become naturalized Germans know German, Kanther would also reduce the
administrative flexibility that the government currently has to deny
naturalization on the grounds that it is not in Germany's interest for someone
to naturalize.</tt><p>
<tt>Some 121,500 ethnic Germans in Kazakhstan left for Germany in 1994, and
300,000 ethnic Russians left the Central Asian republic of 17 million.  The
number of ethnic Germans in Kazakhstan fell from 960,000 to 526,000.  Stalin
moved ethnic Germans from the Volga River and the southern Ukraine to
Kazakhstan in retaliation for their alleged collaboration with the Nazis in
World War II.  Kazakh is now the official language of Kazakhstan, and
non-Kazakhs complain of discrimination.</tt><p>
<tt>The governments of two of Germany's 16 most populous states,
Baden-Wurtemberg and North Rhine-Westphalia, have proposed extending local
voting rights to non-German residents.</tt><p>
<tt>In Berlin, the government estimates that it loses up to $700 million
annually in cigarette taxes as mostly rejected Vietnamese asylum seekers sell
cigarettes that are smuggled into the country.  Germany has pledged $142
million to Vietnam in the form of individual grants and government aid to get
Vietnam to agree to take 40,000 Vietnamese back.</tt><p>
<tt>The number of jobless workers who have been registered as unemployed for
one year or more rose in 1995 to 835,000--or one-third of all the unemployed in
the former West Germany.  The government has proposed that employers who hire
long-term jobless workers receive wage subsidies for two or more years, up from
the current one year.</tt><p>
<tt>The debate over Entsenderichtlinie--the posting of a foreign firm's workers
in the German construction industry continued (August MN). There are also about
140,000 unemployed German construction workers, representing about 10 percent
of the 1.5 million persons employed in German construction.</tt><p>
<tt>There are about 150,000 legal foreign construction workers in
Germany--100,000 from other EU nations, and 50,000 from Eastern Europe.</tt><p>
<tt>The German government wants to require the foreign workers posted to
Germany by their firms to be paid German wages upon their arrival at German
construction sites. The minimum hourly wage in German construction is DM 20.24
($13); the total hourly costs for German construction laborers have been
estimated to be $35 in Germany, $31 in the US, and $14 and $12 in the UK and
Spain.  </tt><p>
<tt>Germany's unions have endorsed proposals to require foreign workers to be
paid minimum German wages in construction for two years, but the proposal
cannot go into effect until German employers agree that industry-wide
agreements between unions and employers also apply to non-participating
employers, such as those who hire non-German EU workers.  The metal industry
association, which includes autos and auto parts, opposes setting a precedent
of applying union wages to non-association employers, for fear that its DM18
minimum wage may be affected.</tt><p>
<tt>Even if the equal wage law is approved in Germany this fall, some German
employers, or British or Spanish workers or firms, may ask the EU Court of
Justice to declare the proposed Entsenderichtlinie contrary to EU freedom of
movement guarantees.</tt><p>
<tt>The president of the German Craft Association was discovered in August to
have employed Romanian construction workers in Munich whose work permits had
expired on July 31, 1995.  Under so-called Werkvertrage, German firms make
contracts with Eastern European firms to supply both workers and other elements
necessary to complete particular parts of projects.  The German president's
firm--despite the president's public statements against foreign construction
workers who are paid less than Germans--was accused of violating Germany's
employer sanctions law. </tt><p>
<tt>In response the employer asserted that all firms competing for public
construction contracts must employ foreign workers for up to 50 percent of
their proposed work forces; winning bids sometimes include even higher
percentages of foreign workers.</tt><p>
<tt>Critics noted that the proposed regulations would not affect the estimated
500,000 illegal workers in the German construction industry, including 200,000
from EU countries who enter as tourists and then go to work without getting the
necessary work permits to which they are entitled.</tt><p>
<tt>In Berlin, authorities announced that Bosnians with TPS would be granted
one-year residence permits rather than six-month Duldung permits so that more
could find jobs and support themselves.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC17">Alien
Smuggling</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></h2>
<tt>The so-called Budapest Group, or the European Conference on Uncontrolled
Migration, began in 1993 to coordinate the efforts of 36 governments to gather
information and promote coordination among interior and other ministries in
eastern and western Europe worried about illegal immigration and alien
smuggling.  The International Centre for Migration Policy Development in Vienna
serves as secretariat to the conference.</tt><p>
<tt>The ICMPD estimated that labor smugglers grossed between $100 million and
$1 billion taking some 300,000 aliens illegally across borders and into Western
Europe for $2,000 to $5,000 each in 1994.  According to ICMPD estimates, half
of all long-term foreign entrants to Western Europe--aside from tourists and
business visitors--are asylum applicants without legitimate claims to
protection and illegal entrants.</tt><p>
<tt>Alien smuggling in Europe has both a south-north and an east-west
character.  In 1993-94, some 12,000 alien smugglers, and 125,000 aliens, were
apprehended by governments in Eastern Europe.</tt><p>
<tt>Many aliens from Asia and Africa believe that, for a price double or triple
the usual ticket, they can get into Germany or Sweden and obtain work or
welfare.  Many are flown by smugglers to Romania or Bulgaria, countries that
permit the nationals of most counties to enter without visas, and then are
driven across eastern Europe.  Another route is to go by boat from Albania to
Italy.</tt><p>
<tt>Governments have three major modes of attacking alien smuggling.  First,
there are general migration control laws and regulations, such as visa
requirements and guards to enforce them.  Second are internal controls,
including employer sanctions to prevent illegal aliens from working, laws to
combat the use of false documents, and penalties on smugglers and aliens.
Third are readmission/extradition agreements to facilitate the return of
persons apprehended.</tt><p>
<tt>There are two major ways to deal with illegal migration.  The so-called
island strategy is to have tight entry controls, and freedom from registration
and employer sanctions within the country.  The so-called continental strategy
is to recognize that, among the millions who pour across borders, some are
illegal aliens, and then prevent them from settling with registration and
employer sanctions systems.</tt><p>
<tt>Most European countries make most aspects of illegal migration criminal
offenses punishable by jail terms.  For example, most countries have laws that
permit them to jail persons who enter without inspection--often from one to
three years-- and persons who facilitate illegal entries, whether smugglers
providing assistance for money, or friends and family.  </tt><p>
<tt>About half of the European countries permit the confiscation of cars, vans,
and money used by or found on smugglers, but many punish only smugglers who are
physically present on their territory, so that, e.g., a Pole who organized the
smuggling of aliens through Germany and into France, but did not accompany
them, is not guilty of smuggling in any country.  In many cases, the penalties
actually levied are only a fraction of the maximum punishment, and there are
few laws that provide for the compounding of penalties if e.g., several
immigration and labor laws are violated simultaneously.</tt><p>
<tt>Forms have been developed on which countries report (1) the number and
nationality of persons refused entry--Hungary denied entry to more than two
million aliens between 1991 and 1995-- and the number apprehended; (2) the
number and nationality of resident illegals; and (3) the number and nationality
of alien smugglers caught.  These data are to be used to develop a
European-wide data bank on alien smuggling.</tt><p>
<tt>Fewer than 500 Bangladeshis applied for asylum in Europe in 1994, but when
it was rumored falsely in June that Portugal would be granting an amnesty, some
500 traveled by bus to Portugal and applied for residence permits.</tt><p>

Increases Border Checks,
Deportations</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>After bombings on July 25 and August 17, France introduced border checks on
persons arriving and departing, and has stepped up its efforts to deport
illegal immigrants, with the goal of deporting 20,000 in 1995.</tt><p>
<tt>France has been chartering planes to return rejected asylum seekers to
Romania and Africa, although it is reported that most of the 100 Malians sent
home by charter flight in 1986 are back in France.  In 1994, only 80 percent
of the foreigners ordered out of France actually were expelled.  The French
government hopes that better cooperation between the police, the courts and
prisons will increase the number deported. </tt><p>
<tt>The French government has also proposed an increase in placements in
detention camps, closer surveillance of  work sites, higher employer sanctions
and increased cooperation with sending nations. </tt><p>
<tt>France is dealing with complications resulting from regulations intended to
deter immigration.  For example, local mayors can refuse to approve marriages,
and if they wrongly do so, can the foreign-French couple may be able to sue for
damages.</tt><p>
<tt>Children in France do not need residence permits until they reach 18.  In
some cases, parents brought children to France illegally, had them educated in
France, and then the child learned at age 18 that he/she is not entitled to a
residence permit because e.g., the parents' application for family unification
was originally rejected on the grounds that sufficient housing was not
available.  Since 1993, such children at age 18 can have their status
regularized only if they can prove that they arrived in France before the age
of six.</tt><p>
<tt>The French Council d'Etat in July declared that the French government
cannot ban all head scarves.  Instead, each school administrator is to decide
which head scarves are ostentatious and thus banned.</tt><p>
<tt>France is grappling with an increase in asylum applications from Bosnians.
On August 20, an eight-year old Bosnian boy was shot when the car he was riding
in attempted to illegally enter France at the Italian border.  France has
20,000 persons from the former Yugoslavia; Germany has 350,000.</tt><p>
<tt>According to Luc Legoux of the Sorbonne University in "The Political Asylum
Crisis in France," the French have spent the last 10 years dealing with a
crisis in political asylum--asylum applications peaked at 60,000 in 1989.  The
number of political asylum requests then dropped because the French rejected
most applications.  That resulted in a decline in the number of unjustified
cases and a drop in the number of requests that are based on
persecution.</tt><p>

Alien Apprehensions Rise in
Britain</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a><a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></h2>
<tt>The number of illegal aliens apprehended in the UK has doubled since 1989
to 13,000 in 1994.  About one third of the 66,000 persons stopped entering the
UK in 1994 were denied entry.</tt><p>
<tt>British Home Secretary Michael Howard has proposed that employers be fined
for hiring illegal immigrants.  The proposal was given a cool reception by
immigration advocates and industry leaders.  </tt><p>
<tt>Under the plan, it would be a criminal offense to hire illegal immigrants
without proper work visas.  A simple verification process may be implemented to
ensure that a worker has an authentic National Insurance number. </tt><p>
<tt>Immigration officials say that because the National Insurance numbers are
easy to obtain, it would not be an effective means to cut employment of illegal
aliens. The government had proposed issuing cards for benefit claims and adding
a photograph to driver's licenses, but criticism of those proposals resulted in
their withdrawal. </tt><p>
<tt>British immigration officers found 51 illegal immigrants in a truck
arriving from France.  The illegal aliens were shipped straight back to France.
When reporters followed the immigrants, they found that the illegal immigrants
tried immediately to sneak back into Britain.</tt><p>
<tt>The illegal immigrants paid North African Arabs L1,000 per person for two
entry attempts.  Nearly 3,000 trucks a day pass through Dover, giving smugglers
many opportunities gain entry illegally into Britain.  Apprehensions have
increase from 500 for all of 1994 to 600 between January and July 1995. </tt><p>
<tt>The British government banned the employment of Polish au pairs, but will
continue to allow au pairs from 11 Central and Eastern European nations.  The
government is particularly concerned with increasing number of Poles refused
entry.  Last year, of the 141,000 Polish entrants to the UK, 2,000 were refused
entry, and over 500 were detained as illegal immigrants or overstayers. </tt><p>
<tt>The UK is one of the few European countries in which asylum applications
are rising--there were 28,000 in 1993,  41,000 in 1994, including dependents.
Half were Africans.  Two-thirds of British asylum seekers enter the UK as
tourists or students and then apply for asylum.  There is a backlog of 56,000
asylum applications in the UK. </tt><p>

<tt>Russia and Kyrgyzstan signed an agreement on July 18 to regulate
emigration, especially the emigration of Russian-speakers.  The two countries
say that the quotas will allow them to protect the rights of migrants and
prevent the forcible relocation of people. </tt><p>
<tt>About 143,500 people left Kyrgyzstan in 1993, and more than one-third of
the emigrants moved to Russia.  About 49,500 left in 1994, but only 5,000 left
in the first half of 1995.</tt><p>
<tt>Russia has one of the longest border's in the world--about 37,000 miles,
and 200,000 Federal Border Guards, one of the largest border patrols in the
world.  But officials complain that, especially on the Chinese-Russian border,
visa-free short-term entry has led to an estimated 200,000 to 800,000 legal and
illegal Chinese residents.  The Russian Federal Migration Services said they
expect nearly three million migrants from Central Asia over the next several
years. </tt><p>
<tt>Russian officials are expecting that the rise of Chinese immigrants will be
offset by an influx in about five million ethnic Russians from the former
Soviet republics over the next three to four years.  Many of the immigrants are
moving to central and southern regions competing for the few jobs in the area.
</tt><p>
<tt>European governments, as well as the US and Canada, are providing training,
vehicles, and some assistance to help Eastern European nations and Russia
combat illegal immigration and alien smuggling.  However, as the western
nations tighten their immigration and asylum systems, and as countries such as
Hungary and Poland become richer, they become destinations in their own right
for asylum seekers from Sri Lanka and other countries who previously only
transited through Eastern Europe to the west.  </tt><p>
<tt>Russia has an early retirement age--55 for women and 65 for men--and
consequently, about 25 percent of Russia's 150 million people are in retirement
age.  But at least eight million of the 37 million people of retirement age
still work to supplement pensions that average 200,000 rubles ($45) per
month.</tt><p>
<tt>There are an estimated 24,000 villages with fewer than 1,000 residents in
Russia, down from 73,000 in 1960 as young people abandon farms for cities.
More than half of the population of these villages is 65 and older. </tt><p>

<tt>Polish employment officials estimate that there are about 100,000
foreigners working illegally in the country, although the State Labour
Inspectorate believes the number could be 200,000.  Most the foreigners are
from Russia, the Ukraine, and Belarus.  Many work as nannies, gardeners,
housekeepers, and in construction throughout Poland, others work seasonally in
agriculture in eastern Poland.</tt><p>
<tt>A proposed law will force foreigners wishing to enter Poland to demonstrate
that they have enough money to cover their living and travel expenses.  Those
foreigners found illegally employed would be sent to a border crossing point or
held in special prisons.  Anyone deported from Poland would not be allowed to
re-enter for at least two years.  </tt><p>
<tt>The proposed law would also prohibit foreigners who passed through safe
third countries from applying for asylum in Poland.  </tt><p>
<tt>The new regulations also include a six-month temporary visitor's card that
could be extended for only one more six-month period.  Anyone wishing to stay
longer would have to apply to the provincial government for the right to stay
between one and 10 years.  </tt><p>
<tt>After three years of lawful residence, a foreigner could apply for
permanent residence, which would be the first step to Polish citizenship.
Currently, foreigners enter Poland only on the basis of personal invitations
issued by Polish citizens.  Under the new regulations, the provincial governor
would approve the invitation if the inviting person can meet any costs incurred
by the visitor during the stay.  If approved, the bill would become effective
in 1996. </tt><p>
<tt>About 10,000 Vietnamese go to Poland every year with the intent to become
permanent residents, according to the Polish Bureau for Immigration and
Refugees.  Many of the Vietnamese run restaurants or sell Vietnamese goods at
bazaars.  Many Vietnamese believe that their opportunities are better in Poland
than in Vietnam. </tt><p>
<tt>Polish officials believe that Hanoi is trying to turn Poland into a transit
country for Vietnamese people and products by influencing the numbers of
Vietnamese going to Poland.  Many Vietnamese arrive at the Polish border with
official passports which exempt them from visa restrictions.  They then
exchange them for personal passports, which makes it easier to obtain permanent
residency permits.  </tt><p>

</a></h2>
<tt>A Justice Ministry report released on August 17 reported a record 1.35
million foreign residents registered in Japan in December 1994, up 2.5 percent
from 1993 and up 82 percent from 20 years ago.  These resident foreigners
included about 677,000 Koreans, 218,000 Chinese, 160,000 Brazilians, and 86,000
Filipinos.</tt><p>
<tt>Osaka has asked Japan's central government to pay some of the costs of
legal and illegal immigrants who received care, but failed to pay their bills.
In some cases, illegal foreign workers were brought to hospitals in ambulances,
and patients who promised to pay their bills after their release disappeared
without paying.  Only foreigners with visas that permit them to live in Japan
for a year or longer are eligible for coverage under the public medical
insurance system.</tt><p>
<tt>Japan's unemployment rate remained at the historically high level of 3.1
percent in June 1995, and would have been at least two percent higher if not
for the lifetime employment tradition of large Japanese companies.</tt><p>
<tt>Over the past 10 years Japan began to see more visible minorities, such as
Filipinos, Pakistanis, Iranians and Africans, in their country.  Foreigners
commit fewer crimes on average than the Japanese.  Most foreign workers want to
earn money, then return home.  </tt><p>
<tt>Discrimination against dark-skinned foreigners is common.  Less than
one-tenth of the landlords will rent to a Pakistani or Iranian.  Police
frequently ask blacks for their identification. </tt><p>
<tt>Separately, the Japanese government reported that the number of Japanese
living elsewhere in Asia reached 110,000 in 1994, up sharply from 70,000 in
1988.  The number of Japanese living in North America was 277,000 in 1994, down
from the peak 281,000 in 1991. </tt><p>

<tt>A Malaysian non-governmental organization found after a year-long study
that illegal immigrants detained in the country often live in deplorable
conditions.  Between 6,000 and 9,000 illegal immigrant workers are held at nine
camps around Malaysia.  </tt><p>
<tt>The Malaysian government has admitted that about 40 illegal immigrants have
died during the last 18 months in a detention camp near Kuala Lumpur.  Some of
the deaths were the result of beri beri or typhoid infections associated with
malnutrition or unsanitary conditions.  </tt><p>
<tt>The government said that many of the dead were Bangladeshis who arrived in
Malaysia on foot from Thailand and were exhausted, although reports say that
most had been in the camps more than six months.  The Bangladeshi government
called upon the Malaysian government to provide details of the deaths of 28
Bangladeshis in the detention camps.  There are nearly 3,000 Bangladeshis
awaiting deportation in nine detention centers in Malaysia. </tt><p>
<tt>The Malaysian government in response temporarily halted the recruitment of
Bangladeshi workers.  It was reported that Bangladeshis were paying $3,200 in
Dhaka to recruitment agents for jobs that paid $80 per month in Malaysia,
suggesting that the Bangladeshi workers were expecting to stay in Malaysia for
several years. </tt><p>
<tt>Following criticism about worker exploitation by private recruitment firms,
the Malaysian government's Cabinet Committee on Foreign Workers announced on
August 2 that employment agencies would no longer be allowed to recruit foreign
workers, except for domestic workers and shop assistants.  Any contractual
agreements between recruitment firms and foreign workers already in the country
were declared null and void.  The new policy may result in bankruptcy for most
of 169 Malaysian recruitment agencies.</tt><p>
<tt>On August 30, the government announced that it was readying guidelines for
employers to recruit foreign workers directly in Thailand, Bangladesh,
Indonesia, the Philippines and Pakistan under the terms of bilateral agreements
expected to be concluded with these countries.  Malaysian employers who receive
permission to employ foreign workers will apply to each country's employment
service to obtain foreign workers, much as the German guest worker system
handled recruitment in the 1960s.</tt><p>

<tt>A committee of public and private businesses called on the Thai government
to ease restrictions on foreign workers to help solve the labor shortage.  A
government study will be conducted to examine where labor shortages are
occurring and how social problems caused by foreign workers should be handled.
</tt><p>
<tt>According to employers, fisheries need unskilled foreign labor, while the
chemical, petrochemical and electrical sectors need foreign engineers.  The
Employment Department of Thailand announced on July 10 that it would begin a
crackdown on illegal foreign workers, who are blamed for much of the crime and
theft in the country.  </tt><p>
<tt>A workers' group in Thailand asked the government to adopt an eight-point
program to protect Thai workers.  One protection would be to prevent the entry
of foreign workers. </tt><p>
<tt>Employers have asked the government to create a special economic area near
the Thai-Burmese border, known as Zone 4.  Under the proposal, foreign workers
could be employed at low wages.  According to employers, there are no Thai
workers in the area.  According to workers organizations, the local workers
refuse to work because of low wages. </tt><p>
<tt>Since mid-December, up to 10,000 ethnic minority Karen people from Burma
have fled to Thailand.  The Burmese government forces launched an offensive
against the autonomy-seeking Karen guerrillas in the southeast of the country.
About 80,000 displaced Burmese are in Thailand.</tt><p>
<tt>To encourage Laotian and Vietnamese refugees to voluntarily return home,
the Thai government has closed shops, restaurants, cinemas, curbed economic
activities, and frozen cash remittances from abroad.  There are approximately
10,000 Laotians and 6,000 Vietnamese in the three camps.</tt><p>
<tt>Most of the Vietnamese in Thailand arrived after 1989 and never received
refugee status.  The Laotians arrived before 1985 and are officially refugees.
About one-third of the Laotians are Hmong who turned down an earlier
opportunity to be resettled in third countries, including the US. </tt><p>
<tt>About 5,000 Bangladeshi illegal immigrants are believed to be hiding in
Thai forests with plans to enter Malaysia to look for jobs.  They were given
false documents in Bangladesh, and promised jobs. </tt><p>
<tt>The Thai textile producers association asked the government to permit the
employment of workers from Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam to lower their costs and
to reduce illegal immigration.  </tt><p>

</a></h2>
<tt>Teitelbaum, Michael and Myron Wiener (Eds).  1995.  Threatened People,
Threatened Borders: World Migration and US Policy.  New York: Norton.</tt><p>
<tt>The 86th American Assembly brought together 54 persons interested in
migration and refugee issues November 10-13 in New York to consider how US.
migration policies should respond to a changing world.  Many questions were
raised, from whether US. foreign policies increase, decrease, or have no effect
on migration flows, to why acceptance of immigrants seems to vary across the
US., (for example, in New York political leaders have welcomed " hard-working
illegal immigrants", while in LA virtually all political leaders have pledged
to do more to reduce illegal immigration).</tt><p>
<tt>Organizers framed the discussion around three sets of questions.  First, is
the US. policy of permitting the settlement of almost all foreigners who arrive
seeking safe haven viable?   Second, does continuing illegal immigration
threaten the US. policy of extending to immigrants many of the same benefits
available to citizens?  Third, could a UN agency engage in "humanitarian
intervention" to prevent mass or unpredictable emigration?</tt><p>
<tt>What makes these questions difficult is that all represent <i>tradeoffs</i>
between good or desirable goals.  For example, if the US is generous to persons
seeking safe haven, can it later persuade persons who were temporarily
protected in the US to return to often poorer countries that the US considers
safe? </tt><p>
<tt>There was much discussion of the "perception" that immigration imposes
costs on Americans and American society, implying that there may not be a trade
off between the number of newcomers and the costs of adjusting to them.  But
one of the few principles of migration is that immigration occurs in waves,
implying peaks and troughs--it is very hard to find a country or region that
added one percent or more to its population via immigration for more than one
generation.  </tt><p>
<tt>Although adjustment costs may be hard to estimate, since they may not
include only measurable items such as taxes paid and benefits received, they
are real, and, if ignored, they can produce an anti-immigrant backlash that
does reduce immigration levels.</tt><p>
<tt>Finally, there was considerable discussion of the costs and benefits of
having a supra-national authority responsible for preventing mass migrations.
Does the US want to pay all of the costs associated with a Haiti emergency, and
then call the shots, or share the costs, and perhaps have to modify its
policies?</tt><p>
<tt>All of these tradeoffs echo one theme: a country can have more immigrants,
or better conditions and benefits for immigrants, but rarely both.</tt><p>
<tt>As a nation open to immigration, the US. must answer the three fundamental
immigration questions:  how many, from where, and in what status should
newcomers be admitted?  US. foreign policy has influenced the answers to these
questions for the past half century: virtually all persons leaving communist
countries were accepted as refugees in order to "embarrass" those countries and
demonstrate US. superiority.  </tt><p>
<tt>Once established in the US, "trans-national communities" use the family
unification-based US. immigration system to admit more immigrants from their
countries of origin.  In this manner, the US has established migration flows
from Eastern Europe and Southeast Asia.</tt><p>
<tt>Perhaps the clearest point of agreement was that the immigration
consequences of foreign policy decisions can no longer be ignored.  It was
agreed that, before the US unleashes foreign policy instruments from trade to
aid to intervention, their migration consequences should be considered.</tt><p>
<tt>The nine-chapter book includes overview chapters and at least seven
perspectives on the linkages between US foreign policy and the presence in the
US of refugees and immigrants.  Most of the authors are sympathetic to refugees
and immigrants, meaning that they do not believe that the presence of refugees
and immigrants in the US raises insurmountable problems, only the PERCEPTION of
serious problems.   </tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC32">CIIP
Workshop</a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>On August 31, 1995 the Comparative Immigration and Integration Program of
the UC Center for German and European Studies held a workshop on Immigration
Issues in Germany and the US:  Challenges and Options.</tt><p>
<tt>The circumstances over which foreigners enter and stay in industrial
democracies such as Germany and the US are a major issue at the end of the 20th
century, just as they were at the beginning.  Among the most contentious issues
are asylum--how to deal with persons who arrive in a country and ask to stay on
the grounds that, if they return to their country of citizenship, they will
face political persecution--and guest workers, foreign workers who are to live
and work only temporarily in the host country.  
<a name="_Toc334577649"><a name="_Toc334660639"><a name="_Toc334853882"><a name="_Toc334856343"><a name="_Toc334856554"><a name="_Toc334861878"><a name="_Toc334924920"><a name="_Toc334927799"><a name="_Toc334928931"></tt>
<h3>
<a name="RTFToC33">Asylum</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></h3>
<tt>Germany's constitution includes an individual and enforceable right to stay
in Germany while an application for asylum because the individual would face
political persecution at home is considered.  The number of asylum applications
jumped in the early 1990s, peaking at 438,000 in 1992, as migrant workers
joined genuine asylum applicants in a system that was taking three to five
years to reach the decision that 95 percent of all applicants were not entitled
to asylum in Germany.</tt><p>
<tt>A combination of costs, anti-foreigner violence, and the reality that many
foreigners were abusing the asylum process to immigrate to Germany led in 1992
to a political compromise that left in place an individual constitutional right
to apply for asylum in Germany, but added a clause that denied nationals of EU
member nations, and persons who transited through a "safe third country" en
route to Germany access to the constitutional guarantee.  The German Bundestag
generates the list of safe third countries.</tt><p>
<tt>Germany also adopted the safe country of origin concept.  If an asylum
applicant is from a country that is presumed not to persecute its citizens for
political reasons, applicants from such countries can be sent home while their
applications are considered.  As soon as the German Bundestag put Poland,
Hungary, and Romania on the safe country of origin list, the number of
applications from these countries dropped sharply.</tt><p>
<tt>Since Germany is surrounded by EU nations and safe third countries, the
only asylum applicants after this new asylum provision went into effect in July
1993 should have been the 6,000 applicants who applied at Germany airports.
But almost 140,000 foreigners applied for asylum in Germany in 1994, and a
similar number of applications is expected in 1995.</tt><p>
<tt>There are several reasons why there are still an average 350 applications
for asylum daily in Germany is that Germany must prove that the applicant in
fact transited through a safe third countries en route to Germany.  Since many
applicants assert that they were placed, e.g., in a truck and driven to
Germany, and they have no idea of which countries they transited, German
authorities must prove that they in fact transited through safe third
countries.  </tt><p>
<tt>One court has gone much further, ruling that asylum applicants in Germany
have the right to present arguments that designated safe countries are in fact
not safe.  If this interpretation of the asylum compromise is upheld, then
applicants may soon learn that e.g., it is easy to stay in Germany while their
arguments that Poland or Greece are in fact not safe countries in which to
apply for asylum.</tt><p>
<tt>US refugee and asylum practices reflect cold war policies.  The 1980
Refugee Act was supposed to bring the US into line with other industrial
democracies in its treatment of refugees and asylum seekers, but experience
suggests that, in fact, the US continues to grant asylum to persons fleeing
regimes that the US opposes (Nicaragua in the 1980s), and to deny asylum to
persons from friendly nations (El Salvador).</tt><p>
<tt>There were about 150,000 asylum applications in 1994, one-fourth filed by
Guatemalans.  In January 1995, the INS by regulation tightened procedures to
"prevent abuse" of the asylum system--applicants are denied work permits for
180 days after their applications (unless they are granted asylum), and more
are detained while their applications are considered.  </tt><p>
<tt>The INS believes that these reforms have reduced frivolous applications,
but proposals pending in Congress would go much further.  Under one proposal,
for example, applications for asylum would have to be filed within 30 days of
arriving in the US, and could not be filed by persons that the US is seeking to
deport.</tt><p>
<tt>In both the US and Germany, one indicator suggests that these reforms have
"worked"--the number of asylum applications appears to be dropping.  But the
discussion that followed produced assertions that these "temporary fixes" will
be undone by events, such as court interpretations in Germany that re-introduce
lengthy applications procedures.

<h3>
<a name="RTFToC34">Guest
Workers</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h3>
<tt>Germany in the 1960s initiated guest worker programs with its southern
neighbors from Turkey to Italy to Spain.  Guest or foreign worker programs aim
to add workers to the labor force without adding permanent residents to the
population, but the world wide experience with such programs has produced one
of the few "principles of migration" --there is nothing more permanent than
temporary foreign workers.  </tt><p>
<tt>Between 1960 and 1973, some 18.5 million foreigners arrived in Germany, and
almost 5 million settled in Germany.  This means that most guest workers
returned to their countries of origin as planned, but employer requests to
extend the stay of what were in fact probationary immigrants, plus family
unification, produced a stable foreign population in Germany in the
1980s.</tt><p>
<tt>This changed in 1989.  The demise of communism, and an economic boom in
Germany, led to a sharp increase in immigration.  Germany responded, in part
with five new foreign worker programs.</tt><p>
<tt>There are three major differences between the guest worker programs of the
1960s that gave Germany a peak 2.6 million foreign workers in a labor force of
26 million in 1973 and the guest worker programs that in 1995 may add the full
time equivalent of 250,000 foreign workers to a labor force of 40 million.
</tt><p>
<tt>First, in the 1960s, there was a single program or procedure to bring
foreign workers into Germany, and it responded primarily to the needs of German
employers--German employers needed more workers on assembly lines and at
construction sites, and the German Employment Service helped them to find
foreign workers by establishing recruitment and screening offices from Istanbul
to Lisbon. In 1972, some one million guest workers entered Germany.</tt><p>
<tt>In the 1990s, by contrast, there are at least five distinct programs
through which perhaps 300,000 legal foreign workers enter Germany for three to
24 months.  These programs range from a seasonal program that permits foreign
workers to be employed up to 90 days in Germany, a project-tied program that
permits e.g., a German company to subcontract with a Czech company to complete
part of a construction program and the Czech company to send Czech workers to
Germany.  There are also smaller programs under which border commuters,
trainees, and nurses enter Germany to work.</tt><p>
<tt>Unlike the 1960s program, which were mostly a response to domestic labor
shortages, these 1990s programs respond to two distinct impulses.  First,
German employers requests for additional labor--despite an unemployment rate of
nine percent--and second, the need of restructuring economies in Eastern Europe
to find an outlet for especially young workers.  </tt><p>
<tt>Foreign policy played a very significant role in the decision to establish
programs through which seasonal farm workers, construction workers sent by
their home firms to Germany, and trainees can work in Germany.  In fact, some
Germans point to the real bilateral nature of 1990s programs to explain why
Poland and the Czech Republic are willing to cooperate with Germany to reduce
the movement of illegal aliens through their countries and into Germany--Poles
and Czechs do not need visas to enter Germany.</tt><p>
<tt>Second, in the 1990s there are several distinct programs.  In other words,
rather than trying to satisfy all of the domestic and foreign concerns with one
guest worker program, there are today separate programs for very short labor
needs, for workers sent abroad by their home-country employers, and for
trainees and border commuters.  Each program has its own rules on recruitment,
labor market testing, etc.</tt><p>
<tt>Third, there is not yet a consensus on whether the current German programs
will prove to be a substitute for or an addition to illegal immigration from
Eastern Europe.  In the early 1990s, when over 200,000 seasonal Poles and other
East Europeans worked for up to 90 days in Germany, there was undoubtedly some
substitution of legal for otherwise illegal workers.  </tt><p>
<tt>But it is not yet clear whether Germany's decision to permit perhaps one
percent--(500,000) of the 50 million workers in Eastern Europe to work legally
in Germany will in the long run increase or decrease illegal immigration.  If
Eastern Europe can develop quickly, offering jobs and higher wages, supply-push
emigration pressures will decrease.  </tt><p>
<tt>However, demand-pull pressures in Germany are likely to increase as a
result of economic integration in Western Europe and around the world.  The
search for cheap labor by farmers and construction companies is likely to
persist, and it is not yet clear whether the slowly-deregulated German labor
market can continue to keep illegal immigrants a smaller percentage of the
German labor market than they are of the US labor market. </tt><p>
<tt>A review of guest worker programs suggests that most were initiated in
response to macro "emergency" or temporary situations-- the wartime in the US,
what was believed to be the end of a fragile postwar economic recovery in
Europe, and a construction boom in the Middle East.  However, today's US and
German programs are responding to micro labor market shortages, such as in
agriculture and construction, or political considerations.</tt><p>
<tt>Second, employers wanting guest workers usually succeed in getting them,
largely because they can point to real and measurable benefits if foreign
workers are admitted, while opponents offer hypothetical arguments against
their admission, such as wage adjustments will eliminate the labor shortage
easily.  Third, guest worker programs everywhere tend to operate close to plan
in their initial stages, tending to reinforce employers who want them and to
silence critics.

<h3>
<a name="RTFToC35">Border
Control</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h3>
<tt>Every day, the INS apprehends about 3500 mostly Mexican aliens along the
Mexican-US border, about 1.3 million per year.  In September 1993, a local INS
Commissioner introduced a new policy of deterring illegal entry rather than
apprehending illegal aliens in the US, and in August 1994, the INS officially
adopted this prevention of illegal immigration through deterring entry strategy
by massing INS resources at the several points along the border where most
aliens attempt to enter illegally.</tt><p>
<tt>In October 1994, the INS launched Operation Gatekeeper along a 14 mile
section of the 2000 mile border that typically accounts for half of all
apprehensions.  Along the Mexican-US border south of San Diego, a steel-plate
wall, lights, and 1300 agents were arrayed in three lines, so as to discourage
attempts to enter the US illegally.  If aliens did succeed in entering, agents
hoped to apprehend them before they could slip into populated areas.</tt><p>
<tt>Apprehensions dropped in the San Diego area after Gatekeeper was launched
in the fall months of 1994, but have risen sharply in 1995, and are up 10
percent in the first 10 months of FY95 versus FY94.  There were almost 50,000
apprehensions in July 1995.</tt><p>
<tt>A careful examination of the data indicates that apprehensions dropped most
sharply in the areas of the border where the INS concentrated its resources,
and rose sharply in other areas.  In other words, aliens now make their first
attempts at illegal entry at places further east of San Diego, or make a first
attempt in the westernmost section, and subsequent attempts elsewhere.</tt><p>
<tt>There are no definitive data that indicate whether the prevention through
deterrence strategy is in fact reducing overall illegal immigration to the US.
The INS is fingerprinting all of those apprehended in the San Diego area, and
finds that a steady 20 to 30 percent are recidivists, aliens who were caught
before.  </tt><p>
<tt>Some informal surveys of aliens in the US suggest that about 70 percent of
them succeed in entering the US illegally on their first try.  Surveys of
aliens in Mexico find that, even though most of those planning to enter the US
illegally know about Gatekeeper, the INS operation is not deterring them from
planning to attempt illegal entry.</tt><p>
<tt>This suggests that the INS can indeed shift aliens attempting illegal entry
along the border, but it is not yet clear whether the INS can in fact
significantly change the overall flow of unauthorized aliens into the US.  The
INS initially asserted that the effects of Gatekeeper would be apparent within
one year, but internal INS documents say that it will take five years to
"reassert control" over the border by adding fences, lighting, and agents from
west to east.</tt><p>
<tt>The German data, by contrast, suggest that the major new control
measure--the 1993 asylum reform--also reduced illegal entries.  There were
about 35,000 illegal aliens apprehended in Germany in the first half of 1993,
and 17,000 in the first half of 1994.  However, the second half year comparison
shows a smaller difference--19,000 apprehended in the last six months of 1993,
and 14,000 in the last six months of 1994--suggesting that in Germany aliens
and their smugglers may be adapting to the new law.</tt><p>

<tt>President Clinton came to California on Labor Day, September 4, to defend
immigrant rights and affirmative action.  Clinton said that "we should never
...forget that almost everybody here came from somewhere else."  Clinton
assailed politicians who, he said, mislead middle class voters into thinking
that their troubles are due to immigration and affirmative action.</tt><p>
<tt>In a speech to the American Legion, Republican presidential candidate Bob
Dole proposed making English as the nation's official language, and pledged to
end federal support bilingual education if elected president.  Dole's
endorsement of "English-Only" highlighted the fact that 22 states have now made
English their official language for conducting public proceedings.  When he was
Arkansas' governor, Clinton signed legislation in 1987 making English the
official language of Arkansas.</tt><p>
<tt>Some 180 representatives and 18 senators have sponsored legislation that
would make English the "primary, but not the exclusive, language of
government."  Other proposals would eliminate federal support of bilingual
education, and amend the US Constitution to make English the nation's official
language.</tt><p>
<tt>Colin Powell, son of Jamaican immigrants, asserted on September 18 that
illegal immigrants should not receive welfare and other government benefits,
but maintained that their children should continue to be allowed to attend US
schools.  According to Powell, children born to illegal alien parents in the US
should continue to be US citizens<b> </b>from birth.</tt><p>
<tt>The Clinton administration in early September urged Congress to separate
legal and illegal immigration in reform legislation.  This was the approach
taken by the Senate, but the House combined legal and illegal immigration
reform in one bill, and the Senate decided to follow the lead of the
House.</tt><p>

Reform</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>The Senate Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Immigration held a hearing
September 13 on legal immigration reform, and another on September 28 on
nonimmigrants.  Meanwhile, the House Judiciary Committee continued to mark up
its version of comprehensive immigration reform legislation.  </tt><p>
<tt>Although the Administration has not offered a bill, President Clinton has
announced that he would like to sign immigration reform legislation in 1995.
Sponsors are not confident, however, that Congress can approve reform
legislation by year end.</tt><p>
<tt>The legislation moving through Congress would make at least five major
changes.  It would reduce immigration from about 800,000 per year to about
535,000 by eliminating several preference categories, such as the adult
brothers and sisters of US citizens; reduce refugee admissions from about
120,000 annually to 50,000; require family sponsors of immigrants to assume
more financial responsibility for them; establish a national registry of Social
Security and alien numbers to help employers verify who is eligible to work in
the US; and tighten restrictions on the ways US employers recruits  immigrants
to fill vacant jobs.

</a></h3>
<tt>In 1994, 804,416 were immigrants admitted to the US.  About 31 percent or
250,000 were spouses, children, and parents of US citizens, who can enter as
soon as their US citizen sponsors have their paper work approved by the
Immigration and Naturalization Service the Department of State.  Under proposed
immigration reforms, only the parents category, under which 56,000 foreigners
entered, would be changed.</tt><p>
<tt>Under other family preferences,  212,000 immigrant relatives were admitted
in 1994.  Four of the five family preference immigrant categories would be
eliminated--those that permit unmarried adult children of US citizens and legal
residents to immigrate, married children of US citizens, and brothers and
sisters of US citizens.  </tt><p>
<tt>If current proposals are approved, some 2.4 million foreigners waiting in
queues to enter the US on the basis of family ties would find the family
unification door to the US shut.  </tt><p>
<tt>There are another 1.1 million spouses and children of legal immigrant
residents waiting in a queue to come to the US.  To expedite the unification of
nuclear families, the Commission on Immigration Reform and Congress proposed
that the number of slots for such family unification would be increased by up
to 150,000 per year for at least five years.</tt><p>
<tt>Of the 3.5 million persons waiting to immigrate, about 1 million are
Mexicans, and 500,000 are Filipinos, followed by India, China, and Vietnam.

<h3>
<a name="RTFToC5">Permanent
Economic/Employment.</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a> 
</a></h3>
<tt>Unlike the House, which made few changes to the system through which
immigrants are admitted for economic/employment reasons, the Senate proposal
follows CIR recommendations and would reduce the number of permanent immigrants
admitted for economic/employment reasons.  It would require employers who want
permanent immigrants to fill vacant jobs to pay fees into a fund that trains US
workers to fill these jobs.</tt><p>
<tt>The CIR released its recommendations on economic/employment-based
immigration on September 12.  Under the CIR's recommendations, employers could
bring in up to 100,000 economic/employment immigrants, including family
members, each year, down from the current 140,000, but above the FY94 demand
for permanent visas granted<b> </b>on the basis of achievement and work.
</tt><p>
<tt>Under the CIR's recommendations, instead of applying to DOL to prove that
the employer tried to find US workers and failed, a process termed labor
certification that costs the US government about $60 million per year to
administer, employers wanting foreign workers would pay $7,000 to $10,000 per
permanent immigrant into a private fund that would train US workers to fill
vacant jobs identified by employer requests for immigrants.</tt><p>
<tt>Employers willing to pay these fees would be presumed to have searched and
failed to find US workers, and thus save the up to $10,000 they currently pay
lawyers to complete the labor certification process.  </tt><p>
<tt>In FY94, about 123,000 permanent immigrants were admitted under employment
preferences.  However, 30,000 of them were Chinese students who were allowed to
adjust their status, plus unskilled immigrants. This means that only 93,000
persons were admitted under the skilled preferences that would remain if CIR
immigration reforms were adopted -- well under the 100,000 annual quota
proposed by the CIR.  Of those admitted in 1994, 55,000 or 60 percent were
spouses and children of the principal worker for whom a visa was sought.</tt><p>
<tt>The 38,000 "principal workers" admitted for employment reasons in FY94
would have generated $380 million for the training fund had a fee of $10,000
per worker been charged.

</a></h3>
<tt>The Senate discussed an even sharper reduction in numbers--Sen. Alan
Simpson's (R-WY) draft bill would admit only 75,000 economic/employment
permanent immigrants each year.  Employers wanting to obtain immigrants to fill
vacant jobs would have to pay a fee equivalent to 30 percent of the first
year's salary into a training fund.</tt><p>
<tt>Some persons representing employers attacked the
fee-in-lieu-of-certification proposal, arguing that employers now demonstrate
their need for foreign workers by their willingness to pay lawyers and
consultants thousands of dollars to navigate through the current labor
certification system.

</a></h3>
<tt>The House Judiciary Committee on September 18 began to mark up its version
of immigration reform.  The House markup is proceeding slowly, and is not
expected to be completed until mid October.</tt><p>
<tt>On September 21, the committee approved by a 17 to 15 vote the development
of a national registry of authorized workers that would include their names,
Social Security numbers and immigration data.  US employers would be required
to call a toll-free number, or establish a computer link, report the name and
Social Security number or alien number of newly hired workers, and then be told
whether the worker was authorized to work.  </tt><p>
<tt>The US attorney general would be required to establish the national
registry within four years.  If the registry said that the worker was not
authorized to work in the US, he or she would have two weeks to appeal the
registry's determination.</tt><p>
<tt>The system approved by the committee would permit workers to present any of
six documents to employers, but one congressman promised to introduce
legislation that would specify a counterfeit-resistant Social Security card as
the universal work authorization document.</tt><p>
<tt>Rep Elton Gallegly (R-CA) announced on September 20 that he would offer an
amendment on the House floor that would exclude illegal alien children from
free K-12 education, i.e., incorporate the Prop. 187 provision in US
immigration law.  California estimates that 355,000 unauthorized children are
in California schools in 1995-96, and that their education cost $1.7 billion,
or $4,800 each. </tt><p>

<h3>
<a name="RTFToC9">High
Technology and Foreign
Workers</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h3>
<tt>Under current US immigration law, US employers can obtain non-immigrant
temporary foreign workers under at least nine distinct programs.  High-tech and
multinational firms argue that, since they compete in a global economy, they
need to have access to the best and brightest of the world's workers without
unnecessary government-imposed costs and delays.</tt><p>
<tt>Under one program that was discussed extensively, the H-1B program,
employers who want to hire foreign "professionals" for up to six years "attest"
by filing a labor condition application with the Department of Labor that they
have tried and failed to find US citizens and legal immigrants by offering
prevailing wages, and then DOL must approve their request for temporary foreign
workers unless it is "obviously inaccurate."  </tt><p>
<tt>There is no government test of the employer's assertion that US workers are
not available because the H-1B program is meant to meet urgent and short-term
business needs, and DOL is prohibited from investigating until there is a
complaint filed.  One witness testified that his application for 40 H-1B
programmers to be paid $4.50 per hour was approved by DOL in nine days.</tt><p>
<tt>Under the H-1B program, the jobs for which temporary foreign workers are
imported to fill must require professional skills, which is usually interpreted
to mean that the individual filling them must have a BS/BA--it is not enough
that the foreign worker has a BS/BA, the job must require such a degree.  This
leads to confusion in occupations such as nursing--many Filipinas have BS
degrees, but nursing in the US does not require a BS.</tt><p>
<tt>The H-1B program permits up to 65,000 foreign workers to enter the US each
year and, since each can stay in the US for six years, there can be a maximum
390,000 H-1B workers in the US.  There were 43,000 visas issued by DOS to H-1B
workers in FY94, and the INS reported that there were 106,000 admissions of
H-1B workers in FY94--an INS admission occurs each time that an H-1B worker
with a multi-year visa enters the US.  It is estimated that 40 percent of the
new H-1B visa approvals are for high-tech jobs such as programmers.</tt><p>
<tt>Both employer and worker representatives agreed that the H-1B program has
been abused by so-called "body shops" or contractors in what one witness called
a "techno Bracero program."  Syntel, a Michigan computer programming firm whose
labor force is 80 percent H-1B workers from India, supplied programmers for
insurance company AIG after AIG laid off its US programmers.  Mastech, the
company that maintains the White House's computerized correspondence tracking
system, is under investigation for misusing the H1-B program to import over
1,000 of its 1,200 workers. </tt><p>
<tt>DOL reported that its investigations of complaints found that most
employers with H-1B workers are paying the foreigners less than promised in the
attestation, and that most treat H-1B workers as entry-level rather than
professional employees.  This means that H-1B programmers paid $20,000 may be
used to replace US workers paid $50,000 per year.</tt><p>
<tt>DOL recommended that US employers requesting H-1B workers be required to
attest that they did not lay off US workers to make room for the foreign
workers, that the employer lay out a plan in the attestation to recruit US
workers, and that H-1B workers be limited to three years in the US. </tt><p>
<tt>In discussions with senators, DOL endorsed the principle that permanent
immigrants admitted for economic/employment reasons should be screened through
some kind of point system, and that US employers wanting foreigners to fill
vacant jobs should generally fill them with temporary foreign workers.  </tt><p>
<tt>DOL also agreed to review a ruling that universities must pay prevailing
wages to H-1B researchers--universities pay much less to temporary researchers
than private industry--and DOL said that it was considering lowering the
salaries that universities must pay by making a distinction between basic and
applied research.</tt><p>
<tt>Several senators questioned the use of research funds to support foreign
graduate students.  According to one survey, over 70 percent of foreign
graduate students in science and engineering, versus 40 percent of US citizen
students, reported that their primary source of support in graduate school was
university research funds.  </tt><p>
<tt>One reason why foreigners predominate among graduate students in many
science and engineering fields, it was emphasized, is because salaries in these
fields are low in the US relative to business, law, and medicine.</tt><p>
<tt>In a related development, DOL announced that it would soon issue
regulations covering part-time employment by foreign students studying in the
US.  Students holding F-1 visas are permitted to work off-campus for up to 20
hours a week while school is in session, provided the US employer who wants to
hire them submits attestations to the Labor Department and the students'
schools stating that efforts to recruit US workers were unsuccessful.

<a name="RTFToC10">Farm
Workers</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h3>
<tt>Farm workers were the other type of temporary foreign workers discussed on
September 28.</tt><p>
<tt>Growers made three arguments in favor of a new program to import temporary
foreign workers.  First, they asserted that illegal aliens comprise a
significant share of the current farm labor force.  Although the best estimates
are that only about 20 percent of the 2 million people who work for wages on US
crop farms are unauthorized, growers testified that illegal aliens are 50 to 70
percent of some harvest crews, and implied that this percentage is typical
today despite the legalization of over 1 million unauthorized workers in the
SAW program in 1987-88.</tt><p>
<tt>Second, growers asserted that the new control measures under consideration
in Congress--more border controls, more interior enforcement, and a national
registry-- will prevent them from continuing to hire unauthorized workers who
present fraudulent documents.  Given the high percentage of unauthorized
workers in the labor force, the growers' argued that effective controls on
hiring illegal aliens will leave them with a labor shortage.</tt><p>
<tt>Third, growers testified that the current H-2A program is too inflexible to
provide them with foreign workers if labor shortages appear.  Most of the
complaints about the H-2A program centered on US workers recruited for
employers at public expense who, according to farmers, do not show up, work
hard, or remain with the employer.  Other factors include the requirement that
growers pay the higher of three wages, prevailing, minimum, or AEWR, and they
provide housing at no charge to the temporary foreign workers.</tt><p>
<tt>Growers asked Congress to approve an "attestation" procedure similar to
that used by employers to obtain H-1B foreigners for them to obtain foreign
farm workers.  The current H-2A program is a certification program, which means
that the border gate stays shut until the US government opens it and permits
about 16,000 legal farm workers to enter each year.</tt><p>
<tt>Attestation, on the other hand, means that employers open the border gate
by asserting that there are insufficient US workers available, and the border
gate stays open until there are complaints, and the government closes the
gate.</tt><p>
<tt>Under the growers' plan, US farmers, labor contractors, or employer
associations would "attest" that they face shortages of US workers despite the
offer of prevailing wages and working conditions, the listing of the jobs at
local Employment Service offices, and preference to US workers who apply for
farm jobs.  Growers would be able to submit the names of workers who should be
granted nonimmigrant visas in Mexico and elsewhere to come to the US to do farm
work for up to 10 months each year.</tt><p>
<tt>Growers would pay user fees to cover the cost of administering the program,
and the workers would be encouraged to return to their countries of origin
because 25 percent of their US wages would be withheld and repaid to them only
after they returned.  </tt><p>
<tt>Some advocates of the program argue that easy access to foreign workers is
necessary to keep farm wages at a level that would keep fruit and vegetable
agriculture competitive in the global economy.  However, farmers get only about
one-third of the retail value of most fruits and vegetables, and farm workers
receive only one-third of what farmers get, so that, for a $1 head of lettuce,
farmers get an average $0.33, and farm workers $0.11.  </tt><p>
<tt>Even if farm wages rose 50 percent, from today's $4 to $6 range to $6 to $9
per hour, and if all of the wage increases were passed on to consumers, the
head of lettuce would cost consumers $1.05.  Retail prices may fall rather than
rise, as occurred when the end of the Bracero program encouraged farmers and
processors to change the handling of the tomatoes that the Braceros picked.  In
the tomato case, the end of immigrant labor caused production to rise, and
retail prices to fall.</tt><p>
<tt>Growers offered a pre-emptive strike against critics who said that there
were no farm labor shortages by asserting that farmers cannot wait for a
shortage to plan for foreign labor to harvest their crops, that their proposal
was not like the discredited Bracero program, and that, even if the government
tried to push up farm worker wages, there would still be farm labor
shortages.</tt><p>
<tt>Farm worker advocates countered grower assertions on the availability of US
workers.  They made two major arguments.  First, there is no shortage of
workers, only a shortage of decent wages, benefits, and working
conditions.</tt><p>
<tt>Second, employers prefer vulnerable foreign workers to US workers.  In
North Carolina, for example, it was asserted that US citizen-Puerto Rican
workers were sent to employers where they would not have work for two weeks,
and told that they would have to live at their own expense until the work was
ready to begin, while H-2A workers were sent to work immediately.  It is no
wonder, they conclude, that US workers under such circumstances, often abandon
farm jobs, while H-2B workers stay with their employers as required by their
visas.</tt><p>
<tt>It is not clear whether the growers will repeat their successes of the
early 1980s, when they, over the objections of the sponsors of immigration
reform legislation, persuaded Congress to approve a non-certification
alternative to the H-2A program.  </tt><p>
<tt>Two of the key allies of the growers in that battle still influence
immigration policy--Leon Panetta, who led the fight for the growers in the
House, is President Clinton's chief of staff, and Clinton reportedly assured
California farmers in September 1995 that "they would be taken care of" if
labor shortages developed.</tt><p>
<tt>Governor Wilson, in an August session with the California Farm Bureau,
asserted that he had not changed his position since the mid-1980s, when he
persuaded the US Senate to include the Wilson amendment in immigration reform
legislation. Had it been enacted, the Wilson program would have allowed foreign
farm workers to move freely from farm to farm in the US.  An incentive for
their eventual return to Mexico would have been provided according to Wilson,
by  withholding  one-third of their wages for payment when they had gone
home.</tt><p>
<tt>Wilson said it has been difficult to sell such a guest worker program
because of public confusion between illegal immigrants and guest workers.  As a
former presidential candidate, Wilson said that he would expand the US Border
Patrol to reduce illegal immigration, and push to have a guest worker program
instituted.</tt><p>
<tt>Senator John Kyl (R-AZ) and Representative Elton Gallegly (R-CA) are making
the case for growers in 1995 immigration reforms.  President Clinton, the CIR
headed by Barbara Jordan, and Senator Simpson and Representative Lamar Smith
(R-TX) are opposed to an new guest worker program for agriculture.</tt><p>
<tt>Many commentators have urged Congress to approve a guest worker program.
Linda Chavez of the Center for Equal Opportunity, argued that "A guest-worker
program would allow the United States to benefit from the needed labor of
foreign-born workers without entitling them to the myriad social and welfare
benefits that has caused so much resentment in states like California while
reducing illegal immigration."</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC11">Welfare
Reform and
Immigration</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a><a></a></a></a></a></a></a></h2>
<tt>On September 19, the US Senate approved by a vote of 87 to 12 a welfare
reform bill that would end welfare payments to poor persons after two years,
and limit lifetime welfare payments to any individual to five years.  The House
welfare reform plan is tougher, denying both cash aid to teenage mothers, and
increased payments to mothers who have more children while receiving payments.
The Senate plan gives states the option to cutoff such benefits.</tt><p>
<tt>Both the House and the Senate reforms deny most federal means-tested aid to
non-US citizens, but the Senate bar applies only to immigrants who arrive after
the welfare reform goes into effect.  </tt><p>
<tt>Immigrants must show that they have sufficient resources so that they will
not become a "public charge" in the US, or have a US-resident sponsor sign an
affidavit that he/she will support the immigrant so that the immigrant does not
have to apply for welfare benefits.  The welfare reform makes these affidavits
legally binding, and "deems" the immigrant to have access to the income and
assets of the sponsor when authorities calculate whether an immigrant applicant
for welfare qualifies for benefits.</tt><p>
<tt>Immigrants advocates, such as the National Council of La Raza, decried the
measure saying that not only would it bar many legal immigrants from receiving
government assistance, it may deny support even after they are US citizens.
They argue that the bill would create a "second-class citizen," who would be
treated differently because they were not born in the US.  The immigration
advocates object to a provision in the bill which would require sponsors to
support an immigrant even after they become US citizens. </tt><p>
<tt>California is projected to lose $2 billion annually in federal welfare
payments if the Senate version of welfare reform is enacted, and 70 percent of
the reduction in federal payments to California is a result of the bar on
non-US citizens receiving welfare payments.</tt><p>
<tt>House Republicans are attempting to reduce eligibility for and the amount
of the Earned Income Tax Credit.  In one study, about one-fourth of the
benefits paid were fraudulent--some involved immigrants claiming more children
than they had.</tt><p>
<tt>The EITC was first enacted in 1975, and significantly expanded in 1986,
1990, and 1993.  It provides the working poor with $0.07 to $0.40 for each
dollar earned.  This means that a household head earning $4.25 can get an
earned income tax credit of up to $2 per hour in extra take-home pay ($0.40 for
every $1 earned up to $8,900).  A family with two or more children, and an
earned income of less than $25,000, could receive a maximum $2,500 check in
1995.</tt><p>
<tt>An estimated 4.5 million US residents will have their incomes lifted above
the poverty line by the EITC in 1995.  About 35 percent of US families with
children apply for the credit each year--in 1995, the IRS had paid about $21
billion on 18 million claims.  A disproportionately large number of newcomers
are recipients of the credits; thus areas with large numbers of immigrants
would be disproportionately affected.</tt><p>

and
Sweatshops</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></h2>
<tt>On September 12, the US Department of Labor held a "summit" with garment
industry leaders and retailers in New York to discuss labor law violations in
the $89 billion garment industry.  The New York hearing featured women employed
in sweatshops telling Labor Secretary Robert Reich about how little they were
paid for long hours of work.</tt><p>
<tt>Reich also met with 15 major retailers to discuss how better to enforce
labor laws in the shops that sew the garments they sell.  One suggestion was to
include adherence to the Fair Labor Standards Act in the contracts that flow
from retailers and designers through intermediaries to the sewing shops--DOL
has only 900 investigators nationwide to enforce the nation's basic minimum
wage and child labor laws.</tt><p>
<tt>There are 22,000 sewing shops nationwide employing one million workers,
including an estimated 140,000 mostly Latino and Asian workers--80 percent
women-- who are employed in 5,000 legal sewing shops and 1,000 sweatshops that
operate without authorization in California.  There are estimated to be 4,500
sewing shops employing 50,000 workers in New York City.</tt><p>
<tt>El Monte was the Los Angeles area city in which the Thai slave sweatshop
was discovered in August 1995.  Local officials argue that a sweatshop could
have been found in any working class city in the Los Angeles area.  El Monte's
population of  110,000 is 60 percent Latino and 25 percent Asian.</tt><p>
<tt>A review of the evolution of the Los Angeles economy argues that the Los
Angeles labor market experienced two subtractions and one addition that add up
to a two-tier economy and society.  The subtractions were the loss of consumer
durables in the early 1980s, and the loss of aerospace and defense jobs in the
early 1990s.  The addition were low-wage jobs, as illustrated by sewing jobs,
and the fact that, in the 1990 Census, the South Central Los Angeles
congressional district replaced the Mississippi Delta as having the lowest per
capita income in the US.</tt><p>
<tt>A review of the INS efforts to enforce employer sanctions, and thereby
prevent situations such as the Thai slavery sweatshop, criticized the agency
for failing to follow up on tips as early as 1988 that Thai workers may have
been held against their will in the apartment complex.  </tt><p>
<tt>DOL enforcement has also failed to ensure compliance.  A DOL inspection on
September 15, 1995 of 50 registered sewing shops in Los Angeles found
violations in 46.</tt><p>
<tt>The Thai slave case prompted a review of other cases of immigrant smuggling
and exploitation.  A raid on a New York brothel found a madam "buying" Thai
women for $6,000 to $15,000 each, and then requiring the women to repay her by
having sex with men--the $100 paid by each man was kept by the madam; the
prostitute received only tips.</tt><p>
<tt>Japan also faces a problem with Thai women who have been sold as
prostitutes to work in Japanese brothels.  Women's activist organizations say
that there are up to 50,000 Thai women working as prostitutes in Japan.  Most
of the women have been bought for as much as $200,000 from Thai recruiters or
members of Japan's underworld, the yakuza. </tt><p>
<tt>On September 19, three Chinese men were arrested in California for killing
a Chinese immigrant in New York whose family in China had failed to pay the
ransom demanded.  According to authorities, the kidnappers were part of the
Fujianese Flying Dragons, a gang that specializes in kidnapping female Chinese
immigrants in the US and demanding that their families in China pay
ransom.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC13">INS
</a></a>Evaluates Gatekeeper,
</a>SouthPAW</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a> 
</a></h2>
<tt>On October 1, 1994, the INS launched Operation Gatekeeper, a $46 million
operation to halt illegal immigration on the five westernmost miles of the 24
mile-border south of San Diego with a fence, lights, and three lines of agents.
</tt><p>
<tt>One year later, the INS is reporting that Gatekeeper "worked."
Apprehensions in the five-mile sector were down 40 percent to 114,460 in
FY95.</tt><p>
<tt>However, apprehensions in the entire 24-mile San Diego sector were up 14
percent to 512,000, and critics assert that the sector-wide increase in
apprehensions simply shows that controlling the border is like squeezing a
balloon--concentrated efforts at one point simply transfer the aliens further
east.  Those who interview Mexicans attempting to cross, or Mexicans illegally
in the US, report that relatively few are discouraged by smugglers fees that
have risen by $100 or more from previous levels of $200 to $300.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS counters that, as it strengthens the next 19 miles of border
fencing and add agents eastward, illegal aliens will be pushed further east,
and smuggling fees will rise to prohibitive levels.  Some smugglers who have to
drive the extra miles east from Tijuana to Tecate complain that it just takes a
little longer to make a few extra bucks. </tt><p>
<tt>Many believe that the best way to evaluate Gatekeeper is by determining
whether unauthorized workers continue to arrive and find jobs inside the US, or
whether Mexicans considering illegal entry in rural Mexico are discouraged from
attempting to cross into the US.  By these criteria, the ability of Gatekeeper
to keep unauthorized workers out of the US is more mixed.</tt><p>
<tt>Reports from the single most labor-intensive activity in North American
agriculture--the harvest of about 200,000 acres of raisin grapes around Fresno,
California from mid-August to October--found that newly arrived workers are
getting into the US and going to work despite Gatekeeper.  </tt><p>
<tt>Unauthorized workers report that, after several apprehensions in the San
Diego sector, they succeeded in entering the US further east, and that
smugglers' fees rose from $200-$300 to $300-$400.  In addition, workers noted
that they lost days of work in the US because of delays in crossing the border.
Most seem to have persisted until they succeeded in reaching the Fresno
area.</tt><p>
<tt>Informal surveys of aliens in the US suggest that about 70 percent of them
succeed in entering the US illegally on their first try.  Surveys of aliens in
Mexico find that, even though most of those planning to enter the US illegally
know about Gatekeeper, the INS operation is not deterring them from planning to
attempt illegal entry.</tt><p>
<tt>Several southern California congressmen want the INS to build a triple
fence at the San Diego border, with paved border roads in between lines of
fence to prevent digging.  The House Judiciary Committee voted 17-11 to build
the triple fence south of San Diego.  </tt><p>
<tt>The same congressmen also wants the INS to close its interior checkpoints
on Highways 5 and 15 that tries to prevent aliens who elude the Border Patrol
from reaching Los Angeles, and move the agents to the border.  The INS
disagrees, and the Senate on September 12 disagreed with the House and provided
the INS with funds to operate its inland checkpoints.</tt><p>
<tt>Gatekeeper is part of a $540 million crackdown on illegal immigration
announced in February 1994 that has nearly doubled the number of Border Patrol
agents to 4,500.  The INS will have a $2.6 billion budget in FY96, its
highest-ever budget.</tt><p>
<tt>Many believe that the INS should devote more resources to interior
enforcement to prevent unauthorized workers from obtaining US jobs.  On
September 26, the INS announced that Operation SouthPAW (PAW - Protecting
America's Workers) had removed 4,000 unauthorized workers--almost 90 percent
Mexicans--in 31 days of coordinated inspections by DOL and INS investigators in
June and September--from 300 US firms in Mississippi, Tennessee, Arkansas,
Georgia, Alabama and Florida.</tt><p>
<tt>One-third of the illegal workers were found in Georgia, and one-fourth in
Arkansas.  Follow-up surveys by the INS found that local residents filled over
half of the jobs from which illegal aliens were removed.  Some employers were
re-inspected, and ten were fined the maximum $15,000 for continuing to employ
illegal alien workers.</tt><p>
<tt>Arkansas Governor Jim Guy Tucker questioned the significance of
apprehending 600 illegal workers in his state when Tyson Foods alone employs
20,000. Tyson Foods said inspections were disruptive, and the INS apprehended
only 73 workers.  According to Tyson, only 40 jobs were then opened up for
legal workers.  </tt><p>
<tt>Simmons Foods, a company that has worked closely with the INS to learn how
to detect false documents, had six illegal workers in a work force of 650.
Simmons officials said they would like to find a better way to check documents
to eliminate the need for INS inspections. </tt><p>
<tt>If the cost of the enforcement team was $100 per inspector per day, then
the total cost of Operation SouthPAW would have been about $3 million, implying
a cost of about $750 to open each job that paid an average $14,000.</tt><p>
<tt>The raids have brought fear to illegal immigrants in towns throughout the
South.  After Operation Gulf Sweep in Texas, there were reports that in some
towns, streets  and stores were empty because immigrants were afraid they would
be picked up on the street by INS.  One woman said she even gave up
babysitting, and the $75 per week she earned from it, because she was afraid
she would be picked up in the raids. </tt><p>
<tt>Grupo Beta is Mexico's US-trained border police unit, that some US
officials claim is working with the INS to help contain illegal immigration.
Grupo Beta was formed in 1991 to protect migrants from crime, and it is only in
1995 that some in the US government are calling the unit a Mexican effort to
stop illegal immigration.  The border unit is not permitted to stop Mexican
citizens from crossing the border because of their constitutional right to
freedom of movement.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS until mid-September required airlines bringing passengers to the US
without visas to pay for the cost of detaining them if they requested asylum.
INS procedures require the detention of individuals without documents seeking
asylum, but a New York court ruled that the INS could not force the airlines to
pay for detention costs.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS will pay for detention costs in Connecticut, New York, and Vermont,
but in other states, airlines will remain responsible for detention
costs.</tt><p>

<tt>Despite the loss of one million jobs so far in 1995, unemployed Mexicans
have not taken to the streets in protest.  According to observers, social peace
has been maintained by extended family support systems, and by the opening of
the Mexican political system to accommodate protest.  </tt><p>
<tt>Inflation is running at 50 percent, and real wages are falling.  One way
many families survive is to send a family member to the US to earn dollars that
are worth 50 percent more in Mexico in 1995 than they were in 1994.</tt><p>
<tt>In November 1993, President Clinton predicted that NAFTA would add 200,000
US jobs in 1995.  Critics have noted that, as of August 1995, the US Department
of Labor had certified that 38,000 US workers had lost their jobs due to
increased imports from Mexico, and that another 30,000 US workers had applied
for assistance, asserting that NAFTA had caused them to be laid off.</tt><p>
<tt>Mexico has returned to foreign borrowers for loans, touting the fact that
the country ran $3 billion trade surplus in the first half of 1995.  However,
unemployment is up, and the economy is expected to shrink by five to six
percent in 1995.</tt><p>
<tt>Economist Sidney Weintraub finds that one year after its implementation,
NAFTA has been less significant than proponents expected, and more profound
that those who believed an economic union was inevitable.  Weintraub argues
that after the peso devaluation, without NAFTA, there would not have been
similar pressure on the US to bail out Mexico with International Monetary Fund
help. </tt><p>
<tt>As trade between the US and Mexico increases, there has been a push to
create a NAFTA superhighway along US 35 and Mexico 85, connecting the American
midwest with Mexico City, so that a truck could travel from Chicago to Mexico
City within 36 hours.  Under the plan, trucks would be sealed inside each
country, and then be waved through the border crossing in Laredo, Texas.</tt><p>
<tt>There were 419 million legal crossings over the Mexico-US border south of
San Diego in FY94, and frustration is mounting as US border inspectors do more
careful inspections to deal with drugs and illegal immigration.  As a result,
waits to cross the border can be 3 to 4 hours, and Tijuana shoppers have
reported reduced the $2.6 billion they usually spend in the US because of
difficulty in crossing the border.  </tt><p>
<tt>Most observers say that the INS needs to add more inspectors.  Inspectors
now are expected to check vehicles entering the US at the rate of 1 every 30
seconds.  Some have proposed a commuter lane for some of the 40,000 daily
Mexican workers employed in the US, in which electronic devices would screen
vehicles of persons for whom background checks had been completed.  This
system, already in place on the Canadian border, is resisted on the Mexican
border because of fears of corruption.</tt><p>

<tt>The New York City Central Labor Council has committed $200,000 to train 100
organizers to recruit immigrant workers into unions.  According to union
leaders, many immigrants work 72 hours for $250 weekly, which is less than the
$4.25 minimum hourly wage.</tt><p>
<tt>The Clinton administration has endorsed the call for an increase in the
minimum wage from $4.25 to $5.15 per hour.</tt><p>
<tt>In many immigrant neighborhoods, there are many more check cashing
establishments and pawn shops than bank branches.  It has been observed that
many immigrants, finding it hard to get loans in the US, have resorted to
banking arrangements that they used in their countries of origin.</tt><p>
<tt>Most of these informal banking arrangements make borrowed money very
expensive.  Interest rates from so-called loan sharks are as high as six
percent per week.</tt><p>
<tt>The Service Employees International Union, the largest union in California
with 300,000 members, is protesting job cutbacks in Los Angeles county--most of
the jobs eliminated are held by SEIU members.  The SEIU is asking the federal
and state governments to provide more funds to Los Angeles county to avoid
layoffs.</tt><p>
<tt>More than half of the SEIU's 1.1 million members nationwide are in the
public sector, and about 40 percent of US union members are public employees.
The SEIU has become famous for its confrontational tactics--its Justice for
Janitors campaign, for example, involved picketing household-name firms that
employed non-union janitors through contractors.  Such tactics have been
successful--the percentage of Los Angeles janitors in unions has risen from
about 10 percent in 1987 to 90 percent in 1995.</tt><p>

Migration</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></h2>
<tt>The percentage of US residents who change their residences every year has
fallen from about 1 in 5 to 1 in 6.  Americans are also staying closer to home
when they move--the percentage of Americans who moved from one state to another
was only 2.6 percent in the year ending March 1994.</tt><p>
<tt>Several factors contribute to the decline in internal migration, from an
aging population to two-income families to financial insecurity.  Hispanics
were most likely to move; whites least likely.</tt><p>
<tt>An estimated 1.2 million persons moved to the US from abroad between March
1993 and March 1994.</tt><p>
<tt>According to the UCLA Business Forecasting Project, California had no net
immigration--foreign plus domestic combined-- in 1994, for the first time in
the 20th century.  Indeed, after gaining 414,000 people via migration in 1989,
California lost a net 426,000 residents via domestic migration in 1994, and a
total of 1.1 million more Californians left California than entered from other
states since 1990.</tt><p>
<tt>UCLA nonetheless projects that net immigration to California will top
100,000 by the year 2000, largely because employment and income growth are
expected to once again top national rates, but not by as much as in the 1980s.
For example, there were 315,000 building permits issued in California in 1986,
versus less than 100,000 per year in the 1990s, helping to explain why housing
prices fell especially in Los Angeles country, which accounts for about 25
percent of California's population, and why governments there are strapped for
tax revenues.</tt><p>
<tt>Most analyses find that it is lack of jobs in California, not the declining
quality of life, that encourages more US residents to leave than enter
California.  California's unemployment rate of 7.8 percent in August 1995 was
2.2 percent higher than the US rate.</tt><p>
<tt>California's population, 32.5 million in mid-1995, is expected to be 43.3
million in 2000, and 42.5 million in 2015.  This is a 30 percent population
increase, versus a 50 percent increase between 1975 and 1995.</tt><p>
<tt>According to Census estimates based on IRS tax returns, New York also lost
over one million residents to other states between 1991 and 1994, Illinois lost
230,000, New Jersey lost 185,000, and Massachusetts lost 170,000.  Florida
gained a net 500,000 residents via internal migration, Texas, 242,000; and
Arizona, 200,000.</tt><p>

<tt>On September 27, the House Judiciary Committee approved an amendment to the
immigration bill that would create a new refugee category for women who are
threatened with forced abortion or sterilization.  The new category of refugees
is limited to 1,000 women each year.</tt><p>
<tt>In early June, the INS issued new guidelines that permit foreign women to
seek asylum in the US because they face gender-based persecution in their
country of citizenship.  The US joins Canada as the second nation that
recognizes gender-based persecution as the basis for granting asylum.</tt><p>
<tt>It is estimated that the new INS rule might produced 800 to 1,000 more
applications per year.</tt><p>
<tt>About 80 percent of the world's 24 million refugees are women and children
but asylum has most often been granted to men persecuted for their political
activities.  In some cases, women who joined husbands seeking asylum in the US
apply for asylum for themselves on the grounds that their husbands abuse
them.</tt><p>
<tt>INS offices report fewer asylum applicants in 1995.  In Miami, for example,
asylum applications have fallen almost 60 percent, from 1,400 per month to 600
per month.<b>  </b></tt><p>
<tt><b></b>In 1994, 147,605 aliens applied for asylum in the US--8,254
applicants were granted asylum, 29,176 were denied asylum, 16,766 cases have

<tt>Job growth patterns resemble immigration patterns--the fastest growth is at
the extremes of the distribution.  One result is that income is more unequally
distributed than at any time in the past 50 years.</tt><p>
<tt>In August 1995, there were 125 million workers employed in the US labor
market, up 1.6 million from year earlier levels.</tt><p>
<tt>The US Department of Labor divided the new 20 million jobs created between
1983 and 1993 into 278 occupations, ranked these occupations by average
earnings, and found that job growth was concentrated at the top and bottom of
the wage distribution.  Almost 30 percent of net new jobs were in occupations
that paid wages that were in the top 25 percent, and almost 30 percent were in
the bottom 25 percent.</tt><p>
<tt>There were relatively few new jobs created in the middle ranges of the
earnings distribution, jobs that pay about $7.50 per hour, $300 per week,
$1,200 per month, and $15,000 per year.</tt><p>
<tt>There were a total of 40 million new jobs created between 1983 and 1993,
yielding net job growth of 20 million.  About 60 percent of these 40 million
new jobs required little education and training, such as fast food worker and
janitor and cleaner.  This fact helps to explain why the real earnings of males
with only a high school education fell 30 percent between 1973 and 1993, and
why 30-year old high school graduates who were 30 in 1972 saw their real
earnings decline 20 percent by 1992, even though they were getting older and
presumably more experienced.</tt><p>
<tt>According to DOL data, the lowest paid 10 percent of all US full-time
workers earned an average $225 per week, or $900 per month, with no fringe
benefits, in 1992.  A woman with two children on welfare receives an average
$400 per month, plus about $300 in Food Stamps, and usually free health care
and housing and transportation assistance.</tt><p>
<tt>There is some downward mobility in the US labor force, in the sense that
over 20 percent of the production workers in manufacturing in 1994 attended
college, and 71 percent were high school graduates.  Both figures are up
sharply from 14 and 40 percent in 1984.  Better-educated workers are willing to
do factory work because wages and benefits can give them higher wages than
traditional white-collar jobs.</tt><p>
<tt>Most explanations for these labor market and earnings patterns begin with
supply and demand.  The demand for highly educated workers rose sharply in the
1980s, putting upward pressure on their earnings, while foreign competition and
technology reduced the demand for unskilled workers, putting downward pressure
on earnings at the bottom of the labor market.</tt><p>
<tt>The well-educated immigrants entering the top of the labor market have not
slowed earnings growth there appreciably, but the influx of less educated
immigrants has probably contributed to slow earnings growth at the bottom of
the labor market.</tt><p>
<tt>Some US-born persons with less than college education's are leaving
California, Texas, Illinois, Florida, Massachusetts, New York and New Jersey
--states where 80 percent of all immigrants settle--producing what has been
called the "demographic balkanization of the United States ."  Between 1990 and
1994, Los Angeles gained 663,000 immigrants and had a net loss of 848,000
native-born residents, while New York City gained 568,000 immigrants and lost
861,000 native residents.</tt><p>
<tt>If current immigration and internal migration patterns persist, some
demographers project that the US could have 11 states in which the minority
population is more than 40 percent of the total population, while 13 states
would have white, non-Hispanic populations greater than 85 percent.</tt><p>
<tt>In some cases, immigrants starting at the bottom of the job ladder
succeeded in climbing up the job ladder.  A profile of several immigrants who
moved up the job ladder in Chicago-area McDonald's emphasized that the
fast-food chain has adapted its training materials to Spanish-speaking workers,
and can make entry-level workers productive with only a few hours of
instruction.</tt><p>
<tt>McDonald's has about 500,000 employees in the US and Canada, and every year
hires over one million new employees, i.e., turnover is more than 100 percent.
It has been estimated that about 20 million of the 160 million Americans who
have worked in the US labor market over the past 40 years--one in eight--was
employed at some point by a McDonald's.</tt><p>
<tt>McDonald's provides immigrants with the opportunity to learn business
basics.  Management training takes place both on the job, and in regional and
national training centers. </tt><p>
<tt>Most stories about immigration, trade, and US workers focus on the bottom
rungs of the labor market, where US workers typically have less than a high
school diploma, or, in extended analyses, up to a high school diploma.  But an
August 28 story in the New York Times pointed out that the same technologies
that permit multinational firms to hire local workers to process everything
from airline tickets to grocery store coupons overseas also permit firms to
have more sophisticated tasks done overseas, such as computer
programming.</tt><p>
<tt>Multinationals favor moving to or creating jobs in countries with lots of
engineers, English and low wages.  India fits the bill for many computer
firms--an estimated 75,000 Indians are programming for US firms in India, at
monthly wages of less than $1500, compared to $5000 in the US.  Bangalore, a
city of three million in the south of India, is that country's Silicon
Valley.</tt><p>
<tt>In 1993, about 23 million or 20 percent of average US employment of 120
million were part-time workers, defined as being employed less than 35 hours
each week.  About two-thirds of these temporary workers voluntarily wanted to
work less than a full or 40 hour work week; the other one-third were
involuntary part-timers who wanted more hours of work.  </tt><p>
<tt>A survey of large US firms found that, in 1 in 5, so-called contingent
workers--temporaries, part-timers, and independent contractors--were 10 percent
or more of their labor forces.</tt><p>
<tt>The average number of hours of work of nonsupervisory production workers
has been falling, from 37 hours per week in 1970 to 34.5 hours per week in
1993.  The 20 million workers in retail trade in 1993 averaged just 29 hours
per week in 1993.</tt><p>
<tt>Some hope that unions can raise the wages of workers at the bottom of the
US labor market.  There are 17 million union members in the US labor force,
including 13 million in unions affiliated with the AFL-CIO, meaning that 1 in 6
US workers is a union member, down from 1 in 3 in 1960.  About 10 million of
these workers are in the private sector, meaning that about 10 percent of all
private sector workers are union members, and 7 million are in the public
sector, meaning that 39 percent of public sector workers are in unions.</tt><p>
<tt>Unions are devoting significantly more resources to organizing especially
unskilled service workers and immigrants, including garbage collectors, poultry
processing workers, and golf course workers.  </tt><p>
<tt>In July, Guatemalan immigrant poultry processing workers voted 238-183 to
have the Laborers International Union represent them at a North Carolina
poultry processing plant, after a mid-May spontaneous strike to protest having
to ask permission to go to the bathroom.  </tt><p>
<tt>However, in California, the United Farm Workers has so far been unable to
turn a 1994 election victory at a Gallo vineyard into a first contract, a
reminder that organizing elections does not always lead to contracts with
higher wages, a reminder that organizing may be necessary to add union members,
but winning elections is not enough to assure collective bargaining
agreements.</tt><p>
<tt>Both candidates to head the AFL-CIO have pledged to spend up to one-third
of the organization's $60 million annual budget on organizing.  </tt><p>
<tt>In New York, garment industry employment fell from 260,000 in 1961 to
80,000 in 1995.  These 80,000 mostly immigrant employees are scattered across
1,000 mostly small firms, and they generate $14 billion in annual sales.
</tt><p>
<tt>The immigrant entrepreneurs who own many small businesses in inner cities
reportedly prefer to hire other immigrants rather than US-citizen Blacks.  The
tendency of minority immigrant entrepreneurs to avoid hiring members of the
largest minority in the US is yet another obstacle for Blacks seeking
entry-level jobs.</tt><p>
<tt>Interviews with immigrant business entrepreneurs find that they believe
immigrant workers are more reliable, have the "right attitude," and are less
likely to file complaints with labor law and other authorities.  Network
hiring, in which current employees bring their friends and relatives to fill
vacant jobs, eliminate many costs of recruitment and training while providing
high quality employees, since co-workers are only likely to bring into the
workplace new workers who will be dependable.</tt><p>
<tt>Immigrants, even those that benefit from affirmative action preferences,
reportedly feel little obligation to overcome historic discrimination against
Blacks.  Jobs that were once filled by Blacks, such as in hotels and
restaurants in Los Angeles, are today filled primarily by immigrants in cities
such as Los Angeles.</tt><p>
<tt>An estimated 17 million US households spent $12.5 billion on landscape and
lawn services in 1993, including $5.6 billion on basic lawn mowing and
fertilizing.  Basic lawn service expenditures are growing by six percent per
year.</tt><p>
<tt>Many "lawn-service businesses" begin with an investment of a few hundred
dollars, and the distribution of hand bills.  Turnover is high, in part because
of "cutthroat" competition from new entrants.</tt><p>
<tt>By the year 2020, between 25 and 30 percent of the residents of industrial
nations such as the US, Germany, and Japan will be 60 or older--the share of
older residents is highest in non-immigrant Japan.  According to the OECD, the
unfunded Social Security liability of the US is over 40 percent of the
country's GDP, meaning that the US should put aside about $2.8 trillion so that
it can earn interest to pay today's levels of pensions and health care benefits
to future retirees without raising tax rates.  In Germany, by contrast, about
1.6 times the current GDP should be set aside, and in Japan, twice the current
GDP should be set aside today.</tt><p>
<tt>Some US companies are complaining of labor shortages. The Wall Street
Journal profiled the problems of Lincoln Electric, a manufacturer of welding
equipment, in finding workers who knew basic math, were willing to learn more,
and would come to work regularly.  According to the company, most of the 26,000
applications submitted over the past 18 months were rejected because the
applicants did not have basic math skills.</tt><p>
<tt>Some observers believe that low wages and a poor image keep many of the
applicants that manufacturers would like to hire from applying for jobs.  Most
of the high school graduates with math skills go to college, and there are
recruited for white-collar jobs that offer the potential for much higher
earnings.</tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC20">Muslims
In France</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>Since the first bomb exploded in Paris on July 25, French police have
stopped an average of over 100,000 mostly Muslim-appearing residents each week
to check their documents.  There are about five million Muslims in France,
including two million ethnic Algerians.  About half of these Muslims are
foreigners, and half are French nationals.  In the US, by contrast, there are
about six million Muslims.</tt><p>
<tt>The wave of attacks is similar to assaults during Algeria's war of
independence from 1954 to 1962.  During that struggle, 6,000 Algerians and 400
French lost their lives in France. </tt><p>
<tt>There is some discussion about whether random police checks represent
discrimination against Muslims and Africans.  Most established Muslim leaders
and organizations have condemned the bombings, and not complained too loudly
about the police checks.  </tt><p>
<tt>However, many North Africans complain that police checks of Arab-looking
residents constitute discrimination.  Some Arab merchants asserted that the
security crackdown has hurt their business.  Most French residents reportedly
approve of street checks, the same strategy that was used to deal with a
similar wave of bombings in 1986.</tt><p>
<tt>Officials believe the current attacks are meant to stop the French
government from supporting the Algerian government.  Others think that the
attacks are meant to encourage immigrants in France to pay "revolutionary
taxes."  During the Algerian war of independence, Algerians in France were
"encouraged" to pay about 25 percent of earnings to Algerian nationalists to
support the struggle for liberation.</tt><p>
<tt>Government officials say fundamentalists recruit jobless immigrant youth in
suburban housing developments--vast blocks of apartment buildings dotted with
satellite dishes that pick up television shows from Morocco, Algeria and
Tunisia that allegedly inspire youth to support fundamentalist regimes in North
Africa.  </tt><p>
<tt>One Algerian-born historian, Benjamin Stora, disagrees, saying that most of
the Algerians plan to remain in France.  Their children are born in France, and
many do not speak Arabic, and are not fundamentalist Muslims.  It is the new
generation of French Muslims, according to Stora, who feel that France does not
want them so they rejected France.  The young French Muslim who was accused of
the recent spat of bombings in France was a member of this alienated part of
society. </tt><p>
<tt>Other social scientists say that the spread of Islam in the Paris suburbs
represents an effort by young people to put order in their lives through
religion.  For those isolated by or excluded by society, Islam gives a center
of reference.  </tt><p>
<tt>According to sociologists, Islam began to grow in the late 1980s when
second-generation immigrants realized that their social and economic
integration was impossible in a society that would not refuse to accept them as
equals.  There has been a growing backlash against the newcomers as high
unemployment persists.</tt><p>
<tt>Some of the Algerians who have been in France for 30 years and have
children who were born in France have chosen to leave the door open to both
France and Algeria.  But many French officials believe that integration into
French society means adopting French language and culture.  </tt><p>
<tt>Some French say there can be no "melting pot."  One mayor of a community
with a large immigrant population banned satellite dishes that could receive
North African programs, saying that he did not want to transform France into a
nation of the Maghreb.</tt><p>
<tt>Recent immigrants often find themselves stranded in housing developments in
Paris suburbs such as Montfermeil, with no direct transportation to Paris,
little industry, and few jobs. The apartment complex of Los Bosquets, which
occupies three percent of the town's area, has 20 percent of its 20,000
population--most of whom are first- or second-generation immigrants.
Unemployment is 25 percent.</tt><p>
<tt>The gray concrete buildings of Los Bosquets and other housing complexes
through Pair suburbs are covered with graffiti and satellite dishes.  Some of
the women at Los Bosquets have organized a group to assist new immigrants
better understand French society and integrate.  But the young men remain
isolated; resorting to drugs and petty crime.  </tt><p>
<tt>Foreigners found without papers are repatriated, some via weekly "charter"
flights that carry about 50 people and cost the government between $8,000 and
$16,000.  Escorted by the police and a doctor, the plane puddle jumps across
Africa, dropping off illegal immigrants in their countries of origin.  </tt><p>
<tt>The government plans to double the number of illegal immigrants expelled
via charter to 15,000 in 1995, and 24,000 in 1996.  For political and legal
reasons, expulsion is difficult--there are 60,000 illegals found each year, yet
only one quarter of them are expelled.  Detention centers will be expanded,
although the government is allowed to hold illegal aliens for only 10 days.
</tt><p>
<tt>France requires Algerians to obtain visas to come to France, and the number
of Algerians applying for visas to visit France fell from 800,000 during the
first eight months of 1989 to 80,000 in 1995.  Many Algerians reportedly do not
apply for visas because they believe that their applications for visas to visit
France will be rejected.</tt><p>
<tt>President Chirac on September 5 threatened to suspend France's
participation in the Schengen agreement that eliminates border controls between
seven EU countries if neighbors such as Germany do not step up their efforts to
stop terrorists from entering their countries, and thus gaining free entry to
France.  The Schengen agreement went into effect in March 1995 among six of the
seven countries; France is currently scheduled to abolish border controls with
Schengen partners in January 1996.</tt><p>
<tt>Belgium and the Netherlands criticized France for threatening to delay the
abolition of border controls.  Belgian officials, for example, assert that
French police no longer have full control over the city of Lille, and criminals
from there cross the border to commit crimes in Belgium.</tt><p>
<tt>Other EU countries were more muted in their criticisms.  Since the Schengen
agreement went into effect, it is reported that immigration inspectors are
checking entrants more carefully, and that non-Schengen countries such as
Sweden and Britain are checking entrants from Schengen countries more
carefully.</tt><p>

</a></h2>
<tt>On September 21, the European Parliament, based in Strasbourg, France,
voted for a series of minimal safeguards for asylum seekers in member states.
The Parliament called for asylum seekers whose requests have been denied to
have the automatic right of appeal.  </tt><p>
<tt>The Parliament also asked for the establishment of an EC Bureau to monitor
population shifts, and to issue a list of safe third countries.  At an EU
summit meeting in October, the Parliament will press for a common definition of
refugee to include all persecuted people, including those who are victims of
fundamentalist groups.  Sexual violence against women, said the Parliament,
should be regarded as a legitimate reason for granting asylum. </tt><p>
<tt>On September 25, the European Union agreed on a list of 100 countries whose
citizens will need a visa to enter the 15-bloc nation.  </tt><p>
<tt>The UNHCR has asked all nations to accept more refugees from the former
Yugoslavia.  There are reports that the US will take in 25,000 more should it
become necessary, and the UNHCR requested that the EU offer to take the other
25,000 refugees in the contingency reserve. </tt><p>
<tt>The Council of Europe, an organization of 39 governments in Europe founded
in 1949, held a three-day meeting September 20-23 in Cyprus to discuss how to
accelerate development and thus reduce emigration pressures.  The conference
was attended by government leaders, academics and business officials.  The
council working to develop economic, environmental and cultural cooperation
between the richer northern Mediterranean and the poorer southern
region.</tt><p>
<tt>Representatives of African nations complained that there were too few
southern Mediterranean officials attending the conference-- most of the 250
delegates came from northern countries. </tt><p>
<tt>From Turkey in the east to Morocco in the west are some 200 million people
who live on annual incomes of up to 15 times less than European nations.
According to one official, this unequal economic development will lead to
instability in both the southern countries and Europe.  At the conclusion of
the conference, officials said that the Mediterranean should not become a
barrier between rich and poor, and urged northern countries to assist with the
economic development of the south. </tt><p>
<tt>The final report noted that "the increasing migration due to demographic
and socioeconomic imbalances, further exacerbated by the growth of
fundamentalist tendencies and the inadequacy of political structures in some of
the countries concerned" is of grave concern on both sides of the
Mediterranean.</tt><p>
<tt>Prior to the conference, the head of the council's Commission on
Environment and Land Management said that Europe can no long economically
sustain large-scale immigration from North Africa and Middle Eastern countries.
One way to assist the governments of those countries, the commissioner said,
would be to control population growth and accelerate economic development.
</tt><p>
<tt>A second conference is scheduled for Italy in 1996 to draft an action plan
on immigration, racism and xenophobia.  According to some observers, the fall
of communism has allowed the "green threat" of Islam to replace the "red
threat" of communism.</tt><p>
<tt>The European Union member states plan to discuss migration with the North
African nations that have EU association agreements November 27-28, 1995 in
Barcelona.  The EU is expected to pledge to help to reduce migratory pressures
by promoting job creation in countries of origin, including supplementing the
investment of remittances of migrants living in EU states in their countries of
origin, and is asking North African countries to cooperate to reduce illegal
immigration, and to accept the return of nationals caught illegally in EU
states. </tt><p>
<tt>There are 18 million unemployed workers in the 15 nation EU, and no
reduction in unemployment is foreseen before 1997.</tt><p>

<tt>The number of asylum seekers fell in nine major European countries in 1994.
In Germany, asylum seekers fell by 60 percent, in Belgium by 46 percent, in
Sweden by 50 percent and in Denmark by 53 percent.  Holland, Germany, Norway
and Spain all set up detention camps and limited welfare claims to asylum
seekers. </tt><p>
<tt>The Netherlands expects about 25,000 asylum applications in 1995, down 50
percent from the 53,000 in 1994.  Asylum procedures were tightened in 1994, and
far fewer applicants are given full A-refugee status.</tt><p>
<tt>The Netherlands Equal Employment for Foreigners Act (WBEAA) requires Dutch
companies with more than 35 employees to report the number of foreign workers
they employ by June 1, 1995, but there is no penalty for non-compliance.  The
purpose of registration is to promote the employment of foreigners living in
the country; only two percent of the employers had reported by June 1.  Denmark
considered and rejected a similar employment-reporting requirement.</tt><p>
<tt>There were 52,000 asylum applications in the Netherlands in 1994, and the
Dutch government responded by building three detention centers, and 13 more
centers where applicants can come and go freely while staying for up to three
months.  Asylum applicants are prohibited from working.</tt><p>
<tt>In 1994, 50,000 foreigners--half of them Turks-- became naturalized Dutch
citizens.  One third of the new Dutch citizens were born in the Netherlands of
foreign parents.</tt><p>
<tt>The Dutch have threatened to stop paying workers compensation to some
persons abroad.  Some 2,700 Moroccans are drawing benefits as a result of
injuries suffered in the Netherlands, and Moroccan doctors have certified 100
percent of those examined as too sick to travel to the Netherlands for second
opinions, and still in need of benefits.</tt><p>
<tt>A bill has been introduced into the Dutch Parliament that would deny most
public services to illegal aliens.  If approved, illegal alien children would
still be able to attend Dutch schools, and obtain emergency medical
care.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC23">Germany</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>:
Asylum Seekers and Foreign Workers</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>On September 22, Germany began to repatriate the 40,000 Vietnamese
scheduled to leave the country by the year 2000.  Persons involved in criminal
activities will be the first to be sent home.  Germany has committed $11
million to Vietnam for reintegration projects, the first payment of a $150
million return agreement.</tt><p>
<tt>Under the plan, $5.7 million dollars will be spent on job creation for the
returning Vietnamese, primarily by making low-interest loans available.  The
German contribution is part of the $142 million dollar package signed in July
for the repatriation of the Vietnamese living illegally in Germany.  </tt><p>
<tt>Some 1,400 Vietnamese applied for asylum in Germany in the first six months
of 1995, but virtually none had their applications accepted.</tt><p>
<tt>There was a crisis in Bonn on September 12, when the Interior Minister
ordered the expulsion of seven Sudanese asylum seekers as soon as their appeals
were rejected.  The seven had arrived at Frankfurt airport in July, and applied
for asylum on the grounds that they faced persecution in the Sudan because they
were student members of a political group opposed to the government.  After
Stern magazine reported on September 20 that at least four of the claims were
false--the men were taxi drivers etc, and not politically active--planned
protests were called off.</tt><p>
<tt>The number of asylum seekers rose to 11,900 in August, bringing the total
for the first eight months of 1995 to 108,000.  </tt><p>
<tt>Germany houses hundreds of asylum seekers on boats in the Hamburg harbor,
sometimes for a year or more.  Some Germans have complained that the boats are
floating concentration camps, while others observe that conditions on the boats
are far better than in most asylum seekers' countries of origin.</tt><p>
<tt>Asylum seekers held on the boats receive about $800 monthly for food and
clothing.  Many are allowed to work as e.g., janitors, but any wages earned
reduce their government payment.  </tt><p>
<tt>In many cases, groups fighting each other at home, such as Kurds and Turks,
live side by side on the boat, sometimes producing fights.</tt><p>
<tt>Ethnic German Aussiedler continue to arrive in Germany from the ex-USSR.
Some 400,000 Aussiedler arrived each year in 1989 and 1990, leading to
procedural changes and a quota that has kept arrivals since then to about
200,000 annually.</tt><p>
<tt>Germany has begun 700 investigations of cases of EU and other foreign
worker employment on German construction sites.  Germany alleges that some
firms, especially British-owned companies, are quick to give their unemployed
workers E101 forms, which show that workers are self-employed, and thus
eligible to ply their trade anywhere in the EU.</tt><p>
<tt>In Berlin, currently the world's largest construction site, Russians and
Ukrainians were found working for $5 per hour.  In the Ruhr, British and Irish
workers were found working for half of the usual German wage of 65DM per hour,
including wages and fringe benefits.  It is estimated that 40 percent of the
80,000 British workers in Germany are drawing UI benefits in the UK while
working in Germany.</tt><p>
<tt>In most cases, Dutch agencies locate workers in the UK, fly them to the
Netherlands, and then bus them to Germany.  </tt><p>
<tt>The German labor minister promised to introduce a bill that would require
German minimum wages to be paid to all workers, foreigners and local alike, in
20 construction occupations for at least two years.  However, the bill will not
be introduced until the various employer associations agree to support
it.</tt><p>
<tt>Metal employers oppose extending the higher minimum construction wage of
20DM per hour to their industry, where the minimum wage is 18DM.  Their
opposition may kill the proposal.</tt><p>
<tt>The German land, or state, of Saarland in September voted to give the
14,000 residents from the other 14 EU countries the right to vote in local
elections beginning in January 1995.  Baden-Wurttemberg and North
Rhine-Westphalia have also indicated that they will extend local voting rights
to EU residents.</tt><p>
<tt>The country most worried about high unemployment leading to a balkanized or
divided society is France, but Germany too is worried about jobless economic
growth.  According to employers, German unions resist granting employers the
flexibility they need to remain competitive, so many are establishing
production facilities abroad.  They point to the IG Metall union's dealings
with Volkswagen, in which the union resisted Volkswagen's calls for flexible
hours of work.</tt><p>
<tt>Some speculate that union-management confrontations in Germany are putting
the country on the same path as Britain in the late 1980s, when the British
government stepped in and weakened the power of unions to help employers get
work and wage flexibility.  </tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC25">Hong
Kong Residents Want UK Passports</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a> 
</a></h2>
<tt>Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten on September 25 said that 3.3 million of
Hong Kong's 6.2 million residents should have the right to immigrate to the UK.
The British government immediately responded with a reaffirmation of its policy
that granted 50,000 heads of families the right to a full British passport and
nationality.  </tt><p>
<tt>About 3.3 million Hong Kong residents now hold the status of Hong Kong
British Dependent Territory citizen or British National, British passports that
do not guarantee the right to abode in Britain.</tt><p>
<tt>A Hong Kong legislator argued that racism prevents the British government
from permitting Hong Kong residents to immigrate.  The legislator pointed out
that people in the crown colonies of the Falkland Islands and Gibraltar have a
right to migrate to Britain.  Conservative British MP John Carlisle responded
that "Britain should not become a dumping ground for every traveling Chinaman."
</tt><p>
<tt>As 1997 approaches, there is a saying that there are only two things Hong
Kong people can do: the middle class can emigrate, and the others can riot.
</tt><p>
<tt>A Preliminary Working Committee was unable to decide whether children born
of illegal immigrants in Hong Kong should be given the right of permanent
residence.  Currently babies born in Hong Kong do not have automatic right of
abode unless the father has an unconditional right of residence in the
territory.  </tt><p>
<tt>Alleged corruption has reportedly encouraged expectant mothers to try to
illegally enter Hong Kong for their births. </tt><p>
<tt>On September 11, a truck with 10 pregnant illegal immigrants from Shenzhen
crashed through the Hong Kong-China border.  One hospital reported that 20
percent of its pregnant patients were from the mainland, including illegal
immigrants, two-way permit holders, and overstayers-- all wanted to have their
children born in Hong Kong.  </tt><p>
<tt>The women believed that since their unborn child had a Hong Kong father,
they would have a better chance of joining the father in Hong Kong after 1997
if they gave birth in Hong Kong.  The immigration department reports that 1,900
babies were born to illegal immigrant women in Hong Kong in the first eight
months of 1995, an increase of 30 percent over the same period last year.
</tt><p>
<tt>In the last three years, 25,000 mainland Chinese women gave birth in Hong
Kong, and 7,000 of those were mothers who illegally entered Hong Kong. </tt><p>
<tt>The governor of Hong Kong rejected a demand to halt the importation of
foreign workers in order to curb unemployment.  Unemployment is currently at
3.5 percent, an 11-year high.  The Democratic party, pro-China legislators and
the unions have demanded a ban on labor importation.</tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC26">Korea
Becomes the Land of Opportunity</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>During the 1980s, Korea was the third leading source of Asian immigrants to
the US--only the Philippines (549,000) and China-including Taiwan (347,000)
sent more immigrants to the US than Korea (334,000).</tt><p>
<tt>But during the 1990s, the number of Korean immigrants coming to the US has
dropped, to about 11,000 in 1994.  According to Koreans, the 1988 Olympic Games
showed expatriate Koreans that their country offered economic opportunity.
According to the Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in each of the last four
years, between 5,000 and 6,500 people returned to Korea, compared with about
800 in 1980.</tt><p>
<tt>There are many reasons why Koreans are leaving the US to return to Korea.
Most begin with Korea's dramatic economic growth.  The demand-pull of
opportunity in Korea is matched by the frustration some Koreans feel in the US.
</tt><p>
<tt>Some Korean professionals believe that there is a glass ceiling in the US
that restricts their advancement here, while their bilingual skills increase
their opportunities in Korea.  Korean-Americans seem to be well accepted in
Korea--the governors of two of Korea's nine provinces recently were US
citizens.  </tt><p>
<tt>Some observers believe that self-employed Koreans have saturated the market
for high-risk dry cleaners, vegetable stores, and liquor stores in the inner
cities of New York and Los Angeles, and are returning to Korea because they
cannot make money in the US.  Some Koreans who return say they never felt
comfortable with the casualness of American society and the English language.
</tt><p>
<tt>The number of foreign workers in Korea is on the rise.  According to the
Ministry of Labor, there were 6,475 legally employed foreign workers as of the
end of July, 1995, plus 34,931 foreigners in various types of work and learn
programs, and over 61,000 illegal foreign workers, making foreign workers just
under one percent of the 12.8 million workers in the country.  </tt><p>
<tt>Another 20,000 foreign workers are expected to enter vocational training
programs in Korea in September, 1995.</tt><p>
<tt>Legal foreign workers were concentrated in the fields of language
instruction, arts and culture, teachers, technicians, researchers and other
specialists.  Almost half of the "trainees" come from China.  Another 25,000
illegal foreign workers are from China, including 20,000 ethnic Koreans.

<a name="RTFToC27">Taiwan</a></a>
Concerned About Guest
Workers</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>The first guest workers arrived in Taiwan in 1990.  By 1995, there were
315,919 foreign workers, and they comprise about three percent of the labor
force.  Over 67 percent of the guest workers are in manufacturing. </tt><p>
<tt>Although the import of labor has kept labor costs low, there is increasing
concern about the social costs of foreign workers.  Some observers have said
that importing guest workers is only a temporary solution, and that the country
must increase its domestic supply of labor and decrease its demand for labor
through automation. </tt><p>
<tt>According to government reports, over 77 percent of Taiwan's
labor-intensive manufacturing enterprises, many with foreign workers, face
labor shortages.  The Council of Labor Affairs reported that Taiwanese
manufacturers received approval for 231,000 foreign workers at the end of 1994,
up 73 percent from one year earlier.  </tt><p>
<tt>The council now plans to extend employers' quotas to hire foreign workers
an extra six months.  Foreign workers will also be allowed to change employers.
</tt><p>
<tt>The Taiwan Textile Federation is working with the Chinese National
Federation of Industries to press for faster passage of the revised Vocational
Service Law, which would allow employers to extend the stay of individual
foreign workers from two years to three years.  The textile federation argues
that the two-year limit has resulted in foreign workers running away from their
employer during the last two months of their two-year contracts. </tt><p>
<tt>A survey of Taiwan workers by the Labor Department found that over half of
the workers in Taiwan province oppose the admission of Chinese mainland
workers.  Fourteen percent oppose the admission of all foreign workers.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC28">Vietnamese
Returnees Find Little Persecution</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>Stories about Vietnamese boat people who have been repatriated to Vietnam
tell of returning to a changed Vietnam.  Political freedom is nonexistent, yet
there is no longer the sense of hopelessness because of improved living
standards.  </tt><p>
<tt>Though many reported fearing a return to Vietnam, those who returned
reportedly soon realized that life was normal.  The UN High Commissioner for
Refugees and other relief agencies report no official persecution or harassment
of returnees. </tt><p>
<tt>The biggest problem many of the returnees face is seeing family members who
often forfeited their life savings to buy them passage on boats.  The UNHCR
repatriation grant of $440 per person helps--especially considering that the
average per capita income in Vietnam is just over $200.  There are also
training courses on business, and "micro-enterprise" grants to returnees who
wish to start small businesses. </tt><p>
<tt>Some Vietnamese who have settled in America have argued with their children
about returning to their native land to help rebuild the country.  Many older
Vietnamese say they could never trust the government.  While their children,
some who have spent most of their lives in the US, see returning as an
opportunity to help.</tt><p>
<tt>Most of the Vietnamese who came to the US before 1975 were professionals
and elite members of the US-backed government who were escaping the communist.
Those who came between 1970 and the early 1980s were boat people, entrepreneurs
and others of modest means.  As Vietnam and the US come closer to normalizing
relations, these difference create a schism in which older Vietnamese refugees
feel that the younger ones are selling out to the "enemy " by normalizing
relations with Vietnam. </tt><p>
<tt>In September, Austria agreed to take up to 60 Vietnamese refugees now
living in Hong Kong detention camps.  This is the first time since 1990 any
country has agreed to take a group of detained Vietnamese.  </tt><p>
<tt>Spain has also agreed to take 19 refugees.  There are about 1,600
Vietnamese "refugees," and 18,000 other Vietnamese, in Hong Kong.  Only 300 are
expected to meet entrance requirements for resettlement nations.  The rest have
medical or drug problems.</tt><p>

</a></h2>
<tt>A United Arab Emirates court condemned a 16-year Filipina maid to death for
stabbing her employer to death.  The maid was originally sentenced to seven
years in jail, but was retried at the request of the Philippines because, she
asserted, her employer had raped her.  The Philippines sent three ministers to
the UAE to plead for her life.</tt><p>
<tt>A Kuwaiti woman was sentenced to 10 years in jail for killing her maid,
allegedly because the maid refused to clean the house.  The Filipino government
has renewed its calls for an end to the posting of more maids to the Middle
East.  </tt><p>
<tt>The Singapore government in September rejected a request by the Philippine
government to participate in the approval process of granting work permits for
Filipino maids who work in Singapore.  The Singapore government said that
because migrant workers come from many countries, it would be impractical to
have a separate system for workers from the Philippines.  The government said
it will issue a work permit as long as the foreign worker has a valid travel
document, and both employer and foreign worker meet the processing criteria.
</tt><p>
<tt>The number of overseas workers exported during the first six months of 1995
declined by three percent.  The Philippine Labor Department attributed the
decline to shrinking foreign markets, reduced pay for foreign workers, and the
Philippine policy of discouraging some overseas employment.  </tt><p>

workers in 43 countries, and they remitted $6 billion in 1994.  </tt><p>

<tt>Libya has expelled 1,500 Palestinian workers, reportedly in retaliation for
the Palestine Liberation Organization making peace with Israel.  There are an
estimated 30,000 Palestinians in Libya.  </tt><p>
<tt>On September 29, the Libyan government announced that all the Palestinian
workers had decided to voluntarily leave the country en masse.  Press reports
indicate it was not a voluntary departure.  In addition, Egyptian and Sudanese
workers have been ordered out of the country.</tt><p>
<tt>According to Libya, the expulsions are part of an effort to reduce the
number of illegal aliens, and to open up jobs for Libyans.  There are reports
that recent rioting between the police and Islamic groups in Benghazi, along
with difficulties paying foreign workers in Libya. </tt><p>
<tt>There are reports that a Libyan team has been sent to Baghdad to recruit
more Iraqis to join the 65,000 who already work in Libya.</tt><p>
<tt>In some cases, the Palestinians expelled have not found a country willing
to accept them.  Some are  stranded on the Libyan border with Egypt, others
have gone to the Gaza Strip or Jordan.  Israel refuses to allow many to enter
because they cannot prove they are permanent residents of the Gaza Strip.  The
United Nations plans to build an emergency camp along the Egyptian-Libyan
border. </tt><p>
<tt>There are also 15,000 Sudanese stranded in a Libyan border town awaiting
transport home.  The remainder of the 200,000 Sudanese have until December 1995
to leave the country. </tt><p>
<tt>In most Middle Eastern countries, migrant workers have few labor rights.
In most countries, workers can lose their work and residence visas for
attempting to organize into unions--in Kuwait, a worker must be legally
employed for at least five years before joining a union.  Foreign workers
cannot hold union offices, and thus cannot directly bargain with
employers.</tt><p>

Action on Immigration</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
The House Judiciary Committee, completed its markup of the 364-page Immigration
in the National Interest Act, HR 2202, on October 24, 1995, voting 23-10 to
send the bill to the full House.  According to primary author Rep. Smith
(R-TX), HR 2202 represents a consensus on what to do about legal and illegal
immigration.<p>
Republican leaders say the House may not consider HR 2202 until 1996, when it
may inject the immigration issue into the 1996 campaign.<p>
There were two major fights in the markup.  The first, in September, was
whether to establish a national registry that includes data on persons legally
authorized to work in the US.  The registry stayed in the bill on a 17-15 vote,
but it would begin as a pilot program in five states, sunset on October 1,
1999, and could be expanded nationally only by a vote of Congress.<p>
The second major issue was resolved on October 11.  The Committee voted 20-14
along party lines to not to divide the immigration reform legislation into
separate legal and illegal immigration bills.  Treating legal and illegal
immigration together increases the chance that Congress will approve the
reduction of places for family members by 30 percent.<p>
Extra slots would be made available during the first five years to reduce the
backlog of one million spouses and children of legal immigrants waiting to be
unified with their families in the US, so that legal immigration is expected to
be about 700,000 per year over the next five years, down from 800,000 in 1994
and 1995.<p>
The debate on reducing family immigration was marked by Democratic assertions
that most immigrants are hard-working "super Americans," while Republicans
claimed that many legal immigrants live in the US "at taxpayers' expense."<p>
On October 12, the committee voted to require asylum applicants to request
asylum within 30 days of arriving in the US, an effort to deter applications
from aliens apprehended in the US.  HR 2202 sets a target of first 75,000, and
later 50,000, refugees per year.<p>
Near the end of the markup, the Committee added 27,000 diversity immigrant
slots for persons from countries that have not sent many immigrants to the
United States in recent times.  An amendment that would have required all
ceremonies for the swearing in of new citizens to be conducted in English was
defeated.<p>
Title 1 of the eight-title bill deals with deterring illegal immigration, which
the bill would attempt to do by mandating a 14-mile triple fence on the
US-Mexican border south of San Diego, and adding another 1,000 Border Patrol
agents. <p>
Title 2 increased penalties on illegal aliens who falsely claim to be US
citizens in order to vote, and Title 3 requires most persons in the US
illegally for one year or more to remain outside the US for at least 10 years
before immigrating legally.<p>
Title 8 of the House bill deals with non-immigrants.  Under the marked-up bill,
US employers wanting to bring foreign workers temporarily to the US would be
divided into two groups: those that were "H-1B dependent," and other employers.
<p>
H-1B dependent employers -- those with 10 percent or more H-1B workers in their
labor forces -- would be required to file certain attestations, but employers
with fewer foreign workers would not need to provide such documentation.  This
represents a considerable loosening of the regulations under which
non-immigrant workers enter the US.<p>
Most newspaper editorial boards support immigration reform.  For example, most
California newspapers endorsed the House bill in October, praising its emphasis
on nuclear family unification, and asserting that stopping the admission of
extended family members was a reasonable trade-off.  Liberal papers often made
their endorsement contingent on removing from the bill provisions that, e.g.,
bar even naturalized citizens from some federal welfare programs.<p>
Opponents of HR 2202 include businesses that benefit from immigration, ethnic
groups, and civil liberties advocates. Ethnic and religious groups opposed<b>
</b>reductions in annual immigration and refugee admissions--some 50 Latino
groups announced the formation of the "96 Coordination" to oppose HR 2202.<p>
The major new entry in the coalition against immigration reform are high
technology businesses<b> --</b> they want to easily bring immigrant and
non-immigrant professionals to the US.  Microsoft, for example, asserts that
1,000 positions remained vacant in 1994 because the company could not find
qualified workers.<p>
Libertarian admissionists such as Wall Street Journal columnist Paul Gigot
attacked immigration reform on September 29, 1995 because of the national
registry. <b> </b>Under Congressional plans, US employers would supply the name
and Social Security number of each new hire, and then be informed if that
worker was legally authorized to work in the US.<p>
Gigot and other Libertarians characterize the registry as an attempt to
deputize US employers as immigration agents.  They point out the potential for
error. With an estimated 65 million hires each year, including first entrants
and persons who change jobs, there may be millions of times in which
individuals are denied jobs because of government computer errors.<p>
Another Libertarian,<b> </b>Glenn Garvin in Reason magazine, asserts that
President Reagan in the early 1980s followed the advice of domestic policy
advisor Martin Anderson, rather than accepting that of Attorney General William
French Smith to explore the development of a work authorization system.
According to Garvin, the INS currently has a 19 percent error rate in a pilot
program under which employers submit the A- or immigration numbers of non-US
citizens to verify their right to work in the US.  <p>
If there is a 19 percent error rate<b> </b>in a national registry --sometime
after the year 2000-- errors could cause severe inconvenience for over 12
million of the 65 million new hires each year.  Supporters of immigration
reform assert that the error rate would decline with experience.<p>
Restrictionists such as FAIR, Carrying Capacity Network, and some state
chapters of Ross Perot's United We Stand Organization argue that HR 2202 does
not go far enough to reduce legal and illegal immigration.  CCN has called for
a moratorium on immigration, permitting a maximum of 100,000 immigrants per
year to enter, including 70,000 spouses and children of US citizens, 5,000
priority workers, and 25,000 refugees. <p>
Sen. Alan K. Simpson (R-Wyo.) will soon introduce a bill patterned after the
House version.<b>  </b>Simpson's bill would reduce the number of immigrants
admitted for economic/employment reasons from 140,000 to 75,000, require US
employers to pay permanent immigrants admitted to fill vacant US jobs at least
10 percent more than the prevailing wage, and to also pay 30 percent of the
first year's salary paid to the immigrant into a US fund dedicated to training
US workers to fill vacant jobs.<p>
Foreign-born persons were about 12 percent of the scientists and engineers in
the US in 1990, and up to half of all persons earning PhDs from US universities
in fields such as computer science were born abroad.  Even though foreign-born
engineers are typically less than five percent of the engineers at computer
companies such as Microsoft and Sun, these companies insist that they need the
foreigners to remain competitive.<p>

The House and Senate in October approved budget proposals for FY96, that began
October 1, 1995, that are projected to reduce federal spending by about $1
trillion over seven years.  Over one-third of these projected savings come from
changes in the federal medical program for older residents, Medicare, and in
the federal-state program that provides health care for poor residents,
Medicaid.<p>
About 10 percent of the projected savings come from changes in federal welfare
programs.  The federal government will make "block grants" to states, and
states will in turn have more discretion to decide who gets cash and other
assistance and how much recipients get.  Most aid to non-US citizens is either
banned, or limited to five years.<p>
The exclusion of immigrants from many welfare programs reflects the addition of
a third question to two classic questions about newcomers--to the questions of
how well do immigrants integrate and what impacts do immigrants have on the US
economy and society, the question of do immigrants pay their way in the welfare
state has loomed large in the 1990s.<p>
At one level, it would seem that the concerns about immigrants and welfare are
misplaced.  In 1970, about six percent of all households headed by a
native-born person received some form of cash assistance in 1969, and this
welfare rate for natives rose to eight percent in 1980, and was seven percent
in 1990.<p>
About six percent of the households headed by foreign-born persons reported
receiving cash assistance in the 1970 Census.  The share of foreign-born
households receiving foreign assistance rose to nine percent in 1980, and
remained at nine percent in 1990.  <p>
However, cash assistance accounts for only about one-fourth of the roughly $180
billion in federal expenditures for poor residents in 1990.  Data from the
Survey of Income and Program (SIPP) participation, which follows households for
32 months, suggest that the gap between households headed by a foreign-born
person, and households headed by a native-born person, is larger for non-cash
assistance such as Medicaid and food stamps than for cash assistance such as
AFDC.<p>
For example, in 1990, SIPP<b> </b>data indicate that about eight percent of all
households headed by a native-born person received in-kind federal assistance,
versus 21 percent of households headed by a foreign-born person.  In
California, about 14 percent of households headed by a US-born person, and 40
percent of households headed by foreign-born persons, received federal in-kind
benefits.<p>
Analysis of these data by George Borjas of Harvard suggests that the gap is
widening for more recent arrivals, leading him to conclude that immigrants are
"assimilating into welfare."  Borjas also believes that, once immigrants begin
obtaining cash and in-kind federal assistance, they stay on the welfare rolls
longer than native-born recipients, a tendency he attributes in part to their
relatively low educational level.  <p>
If current trends continue, Borjas believes that, in California, the welfare
population will increasingly be an immigrant population.<p>
Medicaid is the most expensive in-kind program that provides benefits to poor
people, including immigrants, accounting for about half of federal welfare
expenditures in 1990.  Medicaid reform pending in Congress would eliminate the
requirement that states help to pay for the cost of emergency medical care for
unauthorized immigrants.  Under current law, the federal and state governments
share 50-50 the cost of providing health care to poor people, including
unauthorized immigrants.  <p>
For California, this means that, in FY95, the state and federal governments
will each spend about $414 million to cover the cost of emergency health care
for unauthorized aliens.  House Speaker Gingrich on October 20 indicated that
states with large numbers of illegal aliens would receive funds to cover their
costs of providing emergency care for illegal aliens--some  $6 billion
nationwide over seven years, or $400 million per year to California.<p>
Instead of paying Medicaid bills on a 50-50 basis after they are submitted by
health care providers, the federal government would make block grants to the
states, and they could--but would not have to--use some of their block grant to
provide emergency health care to unauthorized aliens.  However, the block grant
will be about 25 percent less than projected federal spending.<p>
The California Senate Office of Research released a report on October 11 that
concluded<b> </b>that federal welfare and health care reforms would eliminate
federal help for 500,000 of the state's four million legal immigrants who are
not US citizens, costing California $6 to $7 billion over five years.  Under
legislation pending in Congress, non-citizens now getting SSI would lose their
payments beginning on January 1, 1997.<p>
In California, counties are the providers of last resort, required to offer
services to poor people regardless of legal status.  An effort may be made to
copy the Congress and refuse to provide benefits to non-US citizens, but such a
measure might be held unconstitutional under the California and US
Constitutions.<p>
Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-CA), Chairman of the Congressional Task Force on
Immigration Reform, offered an amendment to HR 2202 that would prevent parents
who are illegal aliens from accepting federal benefits, except for medical care
and child nutrition benefits, on behalf of their US citizen children.<p>
On October 25, Gallegly introduced a new study by Donald Huddle that argues
that the 22 million legal and illegal immigrants who settled in the US since
1970 imposed costs on the US that were $51 billion larger than the taxes they
paid.  This would imply that each immigrant, on average, generated costs that
were $2,300 greater than revenues.  <p>
The Urban Institute and other studies dispute these cost-revenue estimates,
finding that immigrants pay more in taxes than they cost in taxes, and that the
cost-benefit ratio shifts in favor of US residents the longer immigrants remain
in the US. <p>
George Borjas estimated that the net benefits from immigration to the US are
about $7 billion per year, or about one-tenth of one percent of the $7 trillion
US GDP.  <p>

On October 1, 1994, the INS launched Operation Gatekeeper--a system to prevent
illegal entry by deterring aliens from attempting to enter the US with fences,
lights, and three lines of agents-- on the US-Mexican border south of San
Diego.<p>
Attorney General Reno announced in mid-October, 1995 that the US Attorney for
San Diego, Alan Bersin, would be a "border czar" responsible for coordinating
US law enforcement efforts along the 2,000 mile US-Mexican border.  The INS
will open its first-ever courts at the port of entry, and prosecute
smugglers.<p>
In 1995, the INS has prosecuted 1,039 illegal immigrants for "felonious illegal
entry," more than in the previous nine years combined.  Most of those charged
are persons with criminal records in the US attempting to reenter the US
illegally.  To hold them in jail until their trials, Reno announced that the US
Navy had agreed to make space available in its San Diego brig.<p>
Reno also announced that the INS would<b> </b>crack down on US employers who
hire illegal aliens, presumably by adding investigators to do more workplace
inspections.<p>
As illegal immigrants attempting entry shift from the westernmost section of
the border further east, homeowners in what were previously isolated areas have
in a few instances taken vigilante action against them in retaliation for
cutting fences etc.  Several cases of homeowners beating aliens are under
investigation.<p>
In mid-October, six New Jersey police officers who removed foreigners from a
private detention camp in June after they rioted to protest mistreatment were
charged with abusing the asylum seekers while transferring them to a local jail
(Migration News, July 1995).  An investigation suggests that the police beat
the foreigners, and made them chant "America is number one."<p>

In October 1995, the 32,000 machinists at the Boeing Company's US factories
went on strike, in part to protest Boeing plans to move some skilled jobs
overseas in order to win plane orders from certain foreign airlines.  The
complaints of Boeing workers, who earn an average $20 per hour or $3,500 per
month, include fears that US workers are cooperating in the export of their
jobs by training replacements who come to Seattle to learn how to do their
jobs.<p>
Boeing counters that, in order to win airplane orders from countries such as
China, it must subcontract the production of components to China.  Chinese
aerospace workers earn 1,000 yuan per month, or $120.<p>
Secretary of Labor Robert Reich said that the Boeing workers have legitimate
complaints, and the Department of Labor is working to tighten the system that
permits non-immigrant foreign workers to enter the US.  In addition to
aerospace machinists, other skilled jobs that are gradually moving overseas
include computer programmers, physical therapists and cinematographers.  <p>
Many skilled US workers are astonished to learn that foreigners can come to the
US from India or the Philippines, learn their jobs, and then the company can
shift those jobs without penalty to the newly trained workers abroad.  US
employers are not required to justify shifting jobs overseas, or to retrain
laid-off US workers. <p>
In many cases, skilled foreigners in the US receive less than US prevailing
wages.  For example, DOL found many cases of foreign physical therapists
earning much less than prevailing US wages--in one case, 54 therapists were
receiving $500 a month in wages, compared with the prevailing US wage of
$2,800.  Foreign technicians working in the US for "half pay" have reportedly
been employed on 200 US films so far in 1995.<p>
US employer groups are resisting any tightening of laws and regulations that
govern the entry of non-immigrant foreigners.  A common assertion is that the
world's supply of brilliant workers is limited, and to remain at the forefront
of global competition, US employers need access to the world's best brains, as
defined by employers.<p>
Some employers in the electronics industry lobbied Congress to relax rules
governing the admission of professional foreign workers under the H-1B program.
In the computer industry, occupations often filled by H-1B foreign workers are
programmers--about one-fourth of all such workers--and engineers.<p>
In January, 1995, DOL issued regulations that require close monitoring of an
H-1B worker's activities and repeated written notification of the worker's
status and salary to his or her colleagues.  Some US employers are trying to
get this tougher enforcement relaxed, asserting that tight enforcement will
make the H-1B program "unworkable."  A maximum of 65,000 H-1B workers can enter
the US each year, but each can remain up to six years, so that the program can
permit up to 390,000 skilled foreign workers to be employed in the US at any
one time.<p>
Reich continued to put pressure on US retailers who buy clothes from some of
the 20,000 US sewing shops, employing 800,000 workers, that supply about half
of US garments. <b> </b>Many of these shops employ unauthorized workers.
According to some sources, DOL plans to step up its raids in the next few
months, and to announce the names of retailers whose labels are found in the
sewing shops.  DOL has 816 inspectors to enforce federal labor laws in about
6.5 million US firms that employ about 110 million workers.<p>
In the continuing debate over the economic benefits and costs of immigration,
the home-building industry released data that suggests about half of all
immigrant households own their homes, so that immigration adds jobs in the
currently one million strong home construction work force, where earnings
average $13 per hour.<p>

Pending</a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
One year after its approval by a vote of 59 to 41 percent, California's Prop.
187 remains tied up in court.<p>
There are two distinct cases pending.  Sections 7 and 8, which prohibit illegal
aliens<b> </b>from obtaining tuition-free public education, is being challenged
in a San Francisco state court by opponents who assert that the denial of free
K-12 education to illegal alien children violates the California constitution's
equal protection clause.  Many observers expect the judge to strike down these
sections.<p>
A second case is pending in federal court in Los Angeles.  All sections of
Prop. 187 are being challenged there as an unlawful effort by California voters
to regulate immigration, which is solely a federal responsibility.  The state
of California is defending Prop. 187 on the grounds that it has the right and
responsibility to allocate its limited resources to provide services to those
voters deem most deserving.<p>
On October 23, the federal judge in Los Angeles indefinitely postponed a
decision on whether some parts of Prop. 187 can take effect even if other
sections are found to be unconstitutional.  Opponents of Prop. 187, including
state-paid attorneys representing the elected State Superintendent of
Education, are arguing that the initiative should be declared unconstitutional
because it is a state effort to interfere with federal immigration policy.<p>
If the Prop. 187 case goes to trial, social science research may take center
stage, much as it did in the 1954 US Supreme Court that ended "separate but
equal" schools for blacks and whites.  Among the issues to be resolved are
questions such as the role of benefits and services in attracting illegal
immigrants and their families to California, or encouraging them to stay, the
impacts of illegal immigrants on US citizen and legal immigrant workers, and
the effects of denying services to illegal immigrants on the quantity and
quality of services available to other state residents.  <p>
For example, if illegal immigrant children were denied K-12 public education
services, California might argue that, given other propositions approved by
voters, implementing Prop. 187 might increase the funds available for K-12
education by five percent, or $1 billion over three to five years.<p>
In Hispanic commentary on the Million Man March, it was noted that the largest
demonstration staged in the US by Hispanics involved 70,000 opponents of Prop.
187 in Los Angeles in October 1994.<p>
In Sacramento, a law pushed by Democrats to head off Prop. 187 has led to
protests from some immigrants.  In 1993, California enacted a law that required
applicants for drivers' licenses to prove that they are legal residents.  The
law was interpreted to make the validity of drivers' licenses coincide with the
length of time the INS permits a foreigner to be in the US.  But visas are
often renewed, forcing Japanese businessmen and foreign students to renew their
drivers' licenses several times, and generating complaints from them about the
time and expense involved .<p>
A California poll found that 55 percent of the state's residents were
"extremely concerned" about illegal immigration, versus about 75 percent who
were concerned about AIDS, public schools, and crime.<p>

</a></h2>
On October 10, Mexican President Zedillo came to Washington, where he repaid
ahead of schedule $700 million of the $12.5 billion Mexico borrowed from the US
in March 1995.  The US made available up to $20 billion to Mexico, part of a
$50 billion international loan package.<p>
The meeting included an announcement that, in order to discourage illegal
Mexican entrants from attempting to re-enter the US,  the federal government
would pay to return up to 10,000 apprehended aliens to their homes in the
interior of Mexico, instead of merely taking them across the border.  Mexico
also announced on October 27, that it plans to increase Mexican agents along
the border to protect migrants from being victimized by smugglers and thieves.
The Mexican agents will not try to prevent the migrants from illegally crossing
the border into the US.<p>
Before Zedillo's arrival, the Mexican ambassador to the US on October 4 decried
the "demagoguery" of American presidential candidates who he said are trying to
attract votes by pandering to voter fears of unstoppable waves of illegal
Mexican migrants.<p>
According to Amb. Silva-Herzog, Americans ignore the "economic benefits" of
Mexican immigrants in the US.  For example, he said, since most California farm
workers are Mexican immigrants, "what would happen if that flow of workers
would be interrupted?"  A North Carolina grower told Silva-Herzog that, without
Mexican workers, he "would be out of business."<p>
Silva-Herzog said that the number one security problem facing Mexico are drug
cartels, which are now capable of landing commercial jets in Mexico filled with
cocaine.<p>
Mexican President Zedillo's October 10 visit to Washington prompted reviews of
NAFTA 21 months after enactment.  NAFTA linked the Mexican economy to the US,
and promised economic benefits to both countries.  In urging Congressional
approval of NAFTA in November 1993, the Clinton Administration predicted that
NAFTA would lead to the creation of a net 170,000 US jobs in its first full
year, 1994.  <p>
Most commentaries noted that NAFTA has not created many net new jobs, in the US
or Mexico, in part because of the peso crisis of December 1994 and the
subsequent recession in Mexico.  In the US, the DOL has certified that 42,000
US workers lost their jobs due to NAFTA-related imports since January
1994--21,500 of these workers are drawing special unemployment benefits from
DOL.  Gary Hufbauer of the Institute for International Economics estimates
that, since NAFTA went into effect, the US lost 225,000 trade-related jobs.<p>
The Clinton Administration argues that exports to Mexico and Canada created
340,000 new jobs since January 1, 1994.<p>
NAFTA sharply divided US public opinion and the US Congress.  Most supporters
of NAFTA point to signs that NAFTA is working, increasing the efficiency of,
for example, auto plants on both sides of the border, as factories specialize
in one model for a bigger market, rather than producing several models.  In
other instances, US jobs that would probably otherwise have gone to Asia went
to Mexico, which increases the likelihood that US workers will produce parts
for the Mexican plants.<p>
NAFTA illustrates how freer trade produces winners and losers, and the losers
tend to be more vocal and visible than the winners.  <p>
In Mexico, the first new "pacto" in 10 months was announced in late October.
The pactos are agreements between government, unions, and businesses that
include growth, inflation and wage targets.  The pacto envisions economic
growth of three percent in 1996, 20 percent inflation, and two-ten percent
hikes in the minimum wage.<p>
In Mexico, manufacturing employment has dropped every month since September
1990, and one million Mexicans lost their jobs in 1995, especially as large
companies streamlined their operations to become globally competitive.  In
rural Mexico, over two-thirds of the farmers questioned in one survey reported
that their incomes had been reduced by a NAFTA-induced influx of corn,
processed meat and milk products that lowered the prices they received for farm
products in Mexico.<p>
The maquiladora industry is booming--employment rose 100,000 or 20 percent
since January 1, 1994, and today tops 600,000.  Maquildora wages fell as a
result of the peso devaluation--from an average $2.54 per hour, including
benefits, to $1.80 hourly-- many workers take home $25 to $45 per week.<p>
Mexican horticultural exports to the US rose about 30 percent in the first half
of 1995 versus 1994, enabling producers who had planted tomatoes in Fall 1994
expecting a $1=3.5 peso exchange rate to reap windfall profits.  But profits
were restrained by the fact that many costs of producing fruits and vegetables
for the US are in dollars.<p>
In a few cases, NAFTA increased US production for the Mexican market in a
manner that increased the US demand for Mexican workers.  Several large US
vegetable growers, for example, moved production from Mexico to California,
finding that they could supply the Mexican market at lower cost from California
than from Mexico.  Since Mexican workers pick most of the produce on both sides
of the border, this raised the US demand for Mexican workers, possibly
increasing illegal immigration.<p>
As a result of Operation Gatekeeper, more immigrants are attempting to enter
the US illegally at the port of entry.  A few have simply rushed the border,
attempting to run or drive past inspection stations.  But most are attempting
to pass themselves off as US citizens or legal immigrants--the number of
persons who were detected attempting to enter the US using fraudulent documents
rose 44 percent in 1995 versus year-earlier levels.  <p>
Women and children are now more likely to try to enter the US illegally with
false documents or by being smuggled in vehicles, so that they can avoid
crossing at night through the canyons.  US officials complain that Mexico
permits smugglers selling documents to operate openly near the border,
including Mexican police who have been seen giving false documents to motorists
waiting to cross.<p>
In Mexico, the outlook for jobs is mixed.  Banamex estimates that a two percent
increase in real GDP growth has been associated with a one percent increase in
paid employment in Mexico since 1980.  There were a net 1.6 million paid jobs
created in Mexico between 1988 and 1994--the total number of paid jobs rose
from 22.1 million to 23.7 million (Banamex, July 1995, 244)<p>
Over these years, Mexico's population rose from 78.4 million to 90.5 million,
and its economically active population rose from 28.9 million to 35.4 million
(persons 12 and older engaged in productive activity or seeking work).  Another
measure of the gap between labor force and job growth can be found in Mexican
Social Security Institute IMSS data--the number of permanent and temporary
beneficiaries rose from 8.3 million in 1988 to 10 million in 1994. <p>
Some 950,000 additional persons are expected to become economically active in
1995, a year in which economic growth is expected to drop by over five percent,
and the number of paid jobs by over one million.<p>
Mexico is experiencing a "silent revolution" as "tens of thousands" of peasant
families move to Mexico City and northern industrial cities. Many of the new
migrants are moving directly to northern border states, where they can find
work as grape- or orange-pickers, and from there move on to the United States.
<p>
In Mexico City, rural-urban migrants are sometimes forced to sleep on the
streets and make a living selling chewing gum to motorists, washing windshields
or begging.  In some instances, the migrants work at night to avoid extortion
by the police; in September 1995, thousands of mostly Indian street-vendors
were banned from the city's central Zocalo square.<p>
According to the College of the Northern Frontier, more than half of all
undocumented Mexican immigrants in the United States come from the central and
southern states of Michoacan, Jalisco, Guanajuato, Zacatecas and Oaxaca--an
estimated 1.8 million Mexicans moved north in 1994, and 800,000 entered the
US.<p>

There is a significant amount of migration within Central and Latin America.
Peruvians are found in Mexico and Mexicans in Canada.  NAFTA has removed trade
barriers and many of the psychological barriers to<b> </b>moving across
borders.  <p>
At a seminar on immigration attended in October by immigration officials from
various Central American nations, the participants agreed that to halt
immigration, countries need to impose harsher fines on traffickers.<p>
Some Latin Americas countries have decided to take measures to curb
immigration.  Argentina and Chile, which have traditionally welcomed
immigrants, are closing the door as unemployment rises in their countries.
Nearly one million Paraguayans and Peruvians are reported to live illegally in
Argentina. <p>
Police in Buenos Aires have been raiding buildings where illegal immigrants are
squatting.  The Argentine government is also trying to stop "false tourists" at
the Bolivian and Brazilian borders. <p>
In a meeting in Mexico on September 20, the foreign ministers of El Salvador
and Mexico recommended creating a commission to propose measures to protect
Latin Americans who suffer discrimination in the US because of Prop. 187.<p>
The Nicaraguan government estimates that every day about 200 aliens, primarily
from Peru, Ecuador, India and China transit through the country without visas
on their way to the US.  Only one percent are captured by authorities.  <p>
An estimated 175,000 Nicaraguans migrate to Costa Rica every year to harvest
sugar cane and coffee and, in 1995, Costa Rican employers will issue them
six-month work permits that guarantee "a decent salary and social security
contributions."  The Costa Rican government, complaining of welfare costs,
recently began deporting Nicaraguans, which led to tensions because many
Nicaraguans are unemployed as a result of a wave of strikes there.<p>
In April, it was disclosed that Honduran government officials accepted $450
million to naturalize illegally about 18,000 Russians, Chinese, Iranian and
nationals of other countries.  The officials collected about $25,000 per person
for Honduran passports, ID cards and naturalization papers.  <p>

Immigration Reform</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
An Immigration and Asylum Bill that strengthens immigration controls and makes
it harder for asylum applicants to settle in the UK is expected to be included
in the Queen's Speech to Parliament on November 15--the speech is Prime
Minister John Major's legislative plan for 1996.  The proposed controls include
a measures to stop income support payments, council tax benefits, housing
benefits, family credits and medical treatment to those who have been denied
asylum.<p>
There are about 50,000 to 60,000 legal immigrants to the UK annually.  There
were 33,000 asylum applicants in the UK in 1994, and a backlog of 70,000 asylum
applicants.  The estimated number of illegal aliens ranges from 25,000 to 1
million.<p>
The Home Office obtained Cabinet approval to include penalties on employers in
Britain's immigration control system.  The Labour Party has opposed the
proposal because they believe it would increase racial discrimination.
Immigrant and business organizations, including the Confederation of British
Industry, oppose the idea because it would force businesses to verify an
immigrant employee's legal status. <p>
The spread of temporary employment agencies has made it easier for illegal
workers to find jobs.  Most employers check to ensure that workers have
National Insurance numbers, and then send them straight to cleaning or
restaurant jobs.<p>
Despite repeated denials by the Home Office, Howard confirmed on October 25
that he also plans to introduce as part of the Immigration and Asylum Act a
list of countries that are considered "safe" from political persecution, so
that applications from asylum-seekers from those countries can be fast tracked.
The Home Office scaled down the plan, which originally included 100 countries,
to a short trial list composed of Ghana, Nigeria, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka,
Romania and Poland.  Since January 1995, over 6,000 from Nigeria and Sri Lanka,
have applied for asylum in Britain.  Downing Street continues to deny knowledge
of the existence of the list. <p>
Human rights organizations say that such a list would be a violation of the
1951 United Nations Convention on Refugees, which requires signatories to treat
every application for political asylum--wherever it comes from--on its
individual merit. <p>
Opposition Labour Party leaders claim that in offering the reported new
proposals, the government was "playing the race card" in order to gain votes.
<p>
British officials report that over 100 immigrants per day have claimed
political asylum in 1995.  If this rate continues, it will be a 46 percent
increase over 1993.  Government officials say that the increase of asylum
seekers is due to the perception that Britain is a "soft touch," offering
liberal welfare benefits which continue throughout the appeal process.  The
immigration department estimates that each asylum seeker cost the taxpayer L100
per week in income support and housing benefits.<p>
Former Minister of Immigration Nicholas Baker wrote in an article appearing in
a British newspaper that Britain acts a magnet to asylum-seekers fleeing
extremely poor countries and that the asylum process is being overrun by bogus
asylum claims.  He called for urgent action to halt the flows by strengthening
asylum controls as Germany did,  resulting in significant decreases in the
number of asylum seekers.<p>

A mayor in southern France has asked the government for permission to prevent
immigrants from settling in his city.  The city council of Beaucaire, in the
Gard region of southern France, passed a resolution demanding that Paris
designate the Gard region as off-limits to all new immigrants, both those
coming from other countries and those who are moving to Gard from other parts
of France.  The mayor of Beaucaire has refused to register the children of
foreigners in local schools.   <p>
Although racist language is illegal in France, a member of the Regional Council
in Toulon says the National Front substitutes the word "immigration" for "North
African", using anti-foreign prejudices to create the image of a white race
under threat by outside forces.  The National Front argues that it wants curbs
on immigration, not restrictions on the immigrants themselves.<p>
On October 17, the eighth bomb exploded in what may be a terrorist campaign to
protest France's support of the current Algerian government, who canceled a
1992 election that the Islamic Salvation Front was expected to win.  In
September, French police killed an Algerian immigrant suspected of planting an
earlier bomb.<p>

Under pressure from the Northern League and the Democratic Party of the Left
(PDS), Italy's biggest party, Italy's coalition government in mid-October
agreed to crack down on criminal illegal aliens. <p>
The draft law in the Italian Parliament includes provisions that would
immediately expel illegal immigrants; an identity card for workers with
permits; a certificate from the country of origin testifying that the foreigner
has not spent longer than 30 days in prison for any crime; the introduction of
a new offense-- trafficking in immigrants, carrying a sentence of up to 15
years; heavy sanctions penalizing those employing illegal labor; delaying the
entry of family members until an foreign worker has been employed two years and
demonstrated that they can be supported.  <p>
The bill will be amended to include an amnesty for some illegal aliens,
accelerated procedures for deporting criminal aliens, and an immigration system
that permits the unification of families in Italy.<p>
If the controls are introduced, the government believes that an estimated
60,000 illegal immigrants from Sri Lanka, Ethiopia, Nigeria and Brazil will be
expelled. <p>
Italy's 1986 and 1990 immigration laws were adopted as emergency measures and,
after a rape committed by two Romanians in daylight in early October prompted
calls to enact the 1995 crackdown as an emergency measure.<p>
Caritas estimates that there were 922,000 legally registered immigrants in
Italy in 1994--37 percent came from Europe, 25 percent from Asia, 19 percent
from Africa, and 18 percent from the Americas.  Legal immigrants in the work
force are mostly maids-60 percent--or in the public sector--18 percent--or in
agriculture--16 percent.<p>
A member of the right-wing National Alliance has demanded an investigation of
the community aid program that gives money to non-EU immigrants.  The National
Alliance wants to halt the distribution of if it is being given to illegal
immigrants.  <p>
North Africans have been brought in to Italy as seasonal agricultural workers
on permit.  Many stay in Italy because they are afraid that if they leave, they
cannot return.  Italy reported that 21,500 foreigners were employed temporarily
in agriculture in 1994, up from 17,000 in 1993.  Another 30,000 are believed to
be working illegally in Italian agriculture.<p>
Expulsion procedures allow 14 days to elapse between a court order and its
execution, except in the case of serious crimes. This permits the poorly
surveyed illegals to destroy documents and disappear. Thus, of 60,000 expulsion
orders issued last year no more than 12,000 were carried out.<p>

</a></h2>
Many Czech companies are complaining of labor shortages, prompting some,
including electrical equipment plants, to bring in foreign workers.  Prague,
with an unemployment rate of just one percent, is a particularly hard place to
find workers.  A new automobile plant on the outskirts of the capital city says
it is having a hard time finding skilled workers.  <p>
Housing presents another problem.  Workers who are laid off cannot move to
another area because of a severe lack of housing.  The government approved a
plan to subsidize mortgages to relieve the housing crisis. <p>
There are an estimated 45,000 legal foreign workers, and an unknown number of
illegal workers.  Apprehensions of illegal foreign workers have been on the
rise.  <p>
In 1993, 750 foreigners without proper permits were expelled.   In 1994, some
982 were apprehended.  Between January and October, 1995, some 1,025 foreigners
working illegally in the Czech Republic were expelled.  According to the Czech
Interior Ministry, most of the illegal foreign workers are Ukrainians in the
construction industry.  Czech construction companies are said to earn large
profits because of low labor costs, and nonpayment of taxes and insurance.<p>
The Labor Office inspects companies for illegal workers every six months, and
the police foreign department inspects more often.  Foreign workers without a
work permit can be banned form the Czech Republic for one year.  Employers
found employing workers without residence or work permits are fined between
$9,600 and $38,500. <p>

</a></h2>
Joerg Haider, leader of the Freedom Party, in mid-October called for Austria's
562,000 immigrants to be repatriated so that they could be "reunited with their
families." Elections are scheduled for December 17, and the Freedom Party is
expected to get between 27 and 30 percent of the votes, which may enable the
Freedom Party to join a coalition government.<p>
There are believed to be 100,000 unauthorized immigrants in Austria.  Haider
demands tough laws to free the country of illegal immigrants,  wants to empower
the police to make systematic identity checks and has suggested using air force
planes to fly  foreigners  back to their country of origin.  Haider's biggest
appeal though, is to those who are tired of the cronyism propagated by the
Social Democrats and People's Party that has governed the country since 1945.
<p>
Some observers argue that although many fear the resurgence of the right wing,
the rise of the multi-party system in countries such as Austria and Italy, is
necessary to strengthen democracy.  And, they say, the far right parties will
only win a small share of the power. <p>
Two letter bombs exploded in separate incidents on October 16, injuring an
Iranian-born doctor and a social worker who deals with immigration.  A letter
bomb sent to a South Korean-born doctor was deactivated prior to explosion.
The attacks are similar to a series of letter bombs sent in 1993 to people
involved in immigration. <p>

</a></h2>
The Dutch city of Rotterdam, where nearly a quarter of the residents are
foreign, is offering $16,000 to each immigrant who returns home to start a
business.  The city government will also pay for a return ticket if the
immigrant fails in his/her native land. <p>
There are 30,000 immigrants from Morocco, 50,000 from the former Dutch colony
of Surinam and 15,000 from the Cape Verde Islands in Rotterdam.<p>
Dutch government auditors call the country's asylum policy insufficient because
there is a backlog of nearly 50,000 applications from asylum seekers hoping to
settle in the Netherlands.  A 1994 legislative amendment to reduce the number
of immigrants seeking asylum and reducing the processing time has not had the
intended effect, according to the Regional Planning Bureau in a report issued
on October 5.<p>
The report indicates that part of the reason for the long processing time,
typically about 11 months, was delays in the exchange of information between
Immigration and Naturalization Services, and the office in charge of housing
refugees. <p>

<a name="RTFToC17">Hong
Kong</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>to
Reduce Foreign Workers</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
In mid-October, Hong Kong cut its foreign worker quota from 25,000 to 5,000
because of an unemployment rate that hit a 10-year high of 3.5 percent of the
2.7 million strong labor force, or 105,000.  Not content with this reduction,
six members of the Hong Kong legislature hope to pass a bill that would halt
all importation of workers.  Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten has said he will
veto the bill if it is passed.  Hong Kong began to import foreign workers in
1989 because of labor shortages.<p>
Unions welcomed the move, and employers criticized it.  The maximum 17,000
foreign workers employed on the new airport are exempted, as are the 1,000
Chinese professionals allowed to work in Hong Kong.<p>
There are now 19,062 foreign workers employed in Hong Kong--including 3,500 as
cooks and waiters--plus 3,509 foreign airport workers, and 203 Chinese
professionals.<p>
There are also about 130,000 foreign maids in Hong Kong.  The Immigration
Department is reportedly considering the issuance of a special identity card
for maids, so that they do not move from household work to stores and
factories, and requiring all foreign workers to surrender their identity cards
upon their departure to help prevent their use by illegal immigrants.  The
Asian Domestic Workers' Union, which represents maids, has been organizing
demonstrations in support of an increase in the minimum wage for maids.<p>
Beginning January 1, 1996, Hong Kong employers wishing to employ foreign
workers will have to prove that local workers are not available by registering
their vacancies with the local Employment Service office and advertising for at
least two months for local workers.<p>
Emigration has averaged over 60,000 per year since 1990, up sharply from 20,000
annually in the early 1980s.  An estimated 500,000 of Hong Kong's 6.5 million
people have passports that would allow them to emigrate.  In 1994, some 43,400
Hong Kong residents emigrated to Canada. <p>
Polls suggest that almost half of all Hong Kong residents may have or develop
the means to emigrate; 35 percent of Hong Kong residents are related to someone
living abroad.<p>
Several countries are attempting to encourage at least some Hong Kong residents
to emigrate.  Some 40,000 Hong Kong residents have the right to immigrate to
Singapore, although only 6,500 have moved.<p>
There continues to be debate over the fate of 3.3 million residents who are
considered British Dependent Territory Citizens and not entitled to immigrate
to the UK.  The British Parliament has refused to consider permitting more than
50,000 Hong Kong heads of households to immigrate, leaving an unknown fate for
some Hong Kong residents, such as East Asians, who will not automatically be
entitled to either Chinese or British citizenship.  <p>
Despite heavy lobbying by Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten, the British
government is not expected to yield on this matter because of the government's
concern with reducing immigration (see story on British Immigration Reform in
this issue). <p>
Chinese law currently permits non-Chinese to acquire Chinese nationality only
if the meet one of the following criteria: 1) they are close relatives of
Chinese nationals; 2) they settle in China or 3) they have other valid reasons.
Many ethnic minorities may meet the criteria of having lived in Hong Kong for
many years, but most non-Chinese living in Hong Kong do not want Chinese
nationality.<p>
The number of Chinese allowed to immigrate to Hong Kong increased in 1995 from
105 to 150 pre day.  Increasing, Chinese mainlanders are finding that Hong Kong
is not the economic heaven they envisioned.  Many mainlanders with high level
education find that they must take lower status jobs when they move to Hong
Kong.  The language barrier also makes it more difficult to find adequate
employment.  Mainlanders must also make do with small apartments because of the
expense of housing in Hong Kong. <p>
The Hong Kong governor acknowledged that the transition from the mainland to
the territory is not easy and that the government should help provide a smother
integration.  Many mainlanders are not aware that there are social services
available for them. <p>
Portugal is turning Macao over to China in 1999, and offering 100,000 of the
467,000 residents the right to immigrate to Portugal.<p>
On October 24, 84 Vietnamese spent nine hours on the tarmac at Hanoi Airport,
refusing to disembark from a forced repatriation flight.  Finally, the
Vietnamese consented to get off the plane with the assistance of uniformed
Vietnamese immigration police.  Observes say that some of those being forcible
repatriated had to be restrained when they were being placed on the plane in
Hong Kong.  <p>
Hong Kong is under pressure from China to repatriate the 20,000 boat people
before 1997. Since 1989, more than 45,000 have returned to Vietnam.<p>

Migrant Workers and Growth in
Asia</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>/a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>

Estimates of the number of migrant workers in Asia range from two million to 13
million.  Whatever the exact amount, the number of migrants is up sharply from
100,000 in the early 1970s.  <p>
Many of the migrant receiving countries do not regard themselves as
"immigration countries," encouraging them to see migrant workers as trainees
and students or to tolerate the presence of illegal workers.  The Migrant Forum
in Asia, a coalition of 50 support groups, asserts that the major problems of
migrants flow from the inability of host countries to decide what role migrants
will play in their societies and economies.<p>
Labor-importing governments are reluctant to acknowledge any long-term need for
foreign workers and to make plans for the immigration, and possibly
integration, of foreigners.  For this reason, the legal status of foreign
workers is often unclear, and there are more announcements of new drives to
curb illegal immigration than there are of bilateral labor agreements.<p>
Many fast-growing labor importers fear being swamped by immigrants from
populous nearby nations.  Unlike North America and Western Europe, in Asia
labor importers are typically dwarfed in size by labor exporters--there are
about 10 Chinese for each Japanese, and 10 Indonesians for each Malay.  This
means that some Japanese and Malaysians see immigration that may get out of
control as a national security threat.<p>
Labor-exporting countries are increasingly concerned about the treatment of
their nationals abroad.  As a result of capital punishment being meted out to
migrant workers from the Philippines and Thailand, most governments have agreed
not to permit workers under 25 to emigrate or to immigrate.  However, it has
proven very difficult to enforce age limits--Malaysian and Filipinos reportedly
complained when it was proposed that only women 35 or older could be maids in
Malaysia.<p>
There is some dispute about the sustainability of fast growth in East Asia.
The Fall 1994 issue of Foreign Affairs carried an article by Paul Krugman
entitled "The Myth of Asia's Miracle," which argued that many of the
fast-growing Asian economies grew by adding labor and capital, but not by
increasing total factor productivity, or the increased output that results from
using scarce resources more effectively.  <p>
In other words, according to Krugman, Asian economies grew fast because they
mobilized resources, Stalinist style--they did not work smarter, which, Krugman
argues, is the only way to achieve rapid growth in the long run.<p>
Since TFP is the residual factor that explains economic growth, after measures
of labor and capital, much of the argument about Krugman's thesis that Asia has
experienced little growth in TFP hinges on how labor, capital, and thus TFP are
measured.  Asia is expected to have higher growth rates than the US and Europe
in the decades ahead, due mostly to rising education levels and high savings
rates, but the "Asian edge" in growth may be only one or two percent rather
than three or four percent.<p>
A study of manufacturing productivity and compensation in the US and several
NICs showed that Korea narrowed the gap with the US fastest between 1970 and
1990--output per Korean worker rose from 22 percent of the US level to 45
percent.  In Mexico, labor productivity in manufacturing was about 30 percent
of US levels in both 1970 and 1990, and in the Philippines, it fell from 30 to
15 percent of US levels.<p>
Compensation rose relative to US levels in most NICS--in Korea, from 10 to 30
percent of US levels, and in the Philippines from 15 to 17 percent--due to
rising real wages and currency appreciation.  Only in Mexico did compensation
fall--from about 30 to 25 percent of US levels.<p>
This means that labor costs per unit of output rose in all the NICS studied
except Mexico.  The unit costs of manufacturing goods fell from US levels in
Mexico, but the US gained in relative efficiency compared to Asian NICs.  For
example, Korean unit labor costs rose from about 45 percent of US levels to 75
percent, and Philippine costs rose from 50 to 110 percent of US costs.<p>

Fights Illegal Workers, Increases Foreign
Workers</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
Taiwan's Council of Labor Affairs has launched an aggressive campaign to
enforce the nation's immigration laws against illegal foreign workers and their
employers.  As of September 1, 1995, almost 17,000 foreign workers who had
completed their work contracts had disappeared without leaving the island, and
12,000 remain in Taiwan, presumably working illegally.  The "runaways" included
11,000 Thais and 5,000 Filipinos.<p>
The National Police Administration plans to apprehend 1,000 illegal alien
workers each month, largely by offering police who arrest three illegal alien
workers cash awards.  Previously, police reportedly had little incentive to
apprehend illegal alien workers.<p>
According to Taiwan authorities, about seven percent or 1 in 14 foreign workers
have illegally broken their contracts, by not staying with their assigned
employers, or by not leaving Taiwan after the contracts expired.  About 220,000
foreign workers have been admitted to Taiwan since 1992.<p>
Despite this problem with illegal foreign workers, the Taiwan government plans
to allow in by the end of the year an additional 30,000 foreign nationals to
work in various manufacturing companies and factories.  This will be the
largest quota ever extended to the manufacturing sector by the Council of Labor
Affairs. <p>

Sees Rise in Illegal Alien
Employment</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
Singapore has about 300,000 foreign workers employed under one of the strictest
guest worker programs in the world, but illegal alien employment in Singapore
seems to be increasing, and authorities have stepped up their enforcement
efforts.<p>
In Singapore, two employers were jailed the first time they were found to have
hired illegal aliens--a construction employer who hired 18 foreign workers who
did not have work permits was sentenced to 26 weeks in jail--the illegal
foreign workers had been at work from one day to two months.<p>
First-time violators of Singapore's employer sanctions laws can be fined the
equivalent of two to four years of the foreign workers' levy, or be jailed up
to one year or both.  According to police, an average 41 employers per month
are prosecuted for hiring illegal alien workers.<p>
In Singapore, the construction industry can hire five foreigners for every
Singaporean employee.<p>
Even though controls are tight, illegal immigrants and overstayers made up more
than 17 per cent of the people arrested last year for committing crimes at
construction sites.  Some 1,065 foreigners were charged with committing crimes
in Singapore in the first half of 1995.<p>
The Singapore government in October announced that it would raise the
retirement age to 67 to avoid over-reliance on foreign workers.  According to
the government: "We are short of workers, and it is better for Singaporeans to
work longer than for us to rely more heavily on foreign workers.  Hence the
Government's long-term objective is to raise retirement age step by step to
67."  The retirement age was raised from 55 to 60 in 1993.<p>

taken advantage of higher wages in the coastal areas and largest cities by
moving there, at least temporarily.<p>
China has about 180 million urban workers, and 450 million working age farmers.
Officially, 2.8 percent of China's urban workers are unemployed--about 95
million urban workers are covered by unemployment insurance-- and 130 to 150
million farmers are "surplus."<p>
Farmers are migrating to urban areas despite recent analyses that suggest urban
unemployment is far higher than three percent, making China's job creation
challenge formidable.  Recent estimates put the urban unemployment rate at 12
to 20 percent--20 percent unemployment would imply 35 million jobless urban
workers.  <p>
Over the next five years, China expects an average five million young workers
to enter the labor force each year, four million state workers to be laid off,
and 24 million farmers to head for the cities, so that about 30 million jobs
must be created annually to prevent unemployment from worsening.  If China
grows by 10 percent annually, there would be about 13 million new urban jobs
created each year.<p>
Many Chinese cities include large numbers of recently-arrived rural migrants.
For example, about 20 percent of Shanghai's 15 million residents are believed
to have arrived from rural areas within the past five years.<p>
Chinese cities have taken different approaches to dealing with what some call
"liumang" or troublemakers, blaming them for crime and crowding urban
transportation systems.  Many cities such as Beijing require migrant workers,
most of whom are 17 to 35 year-old men, to buy temporary work permits, with
sanctions imposed on workers and their employers if migrants are caught without
work permits.<p>
Until the late 1980s, China's household registration system prevented
large-scale internal migration, since persons not registered could not secure
subsidized housing or food coupons.  As China has permitted markets and prices
to substitute for rationing, Chinese residents were freer to
migrate--three-fourths of China's 1.2 billion people live in the northern and
inland areas that have not boomed with the rest of China.<p>
Today, well established networks guide young rural men to particular
construction sites and, increasingly, young rural women to particular
factories.  China is attempting to dampen the demand-pull of urban jobs by
charging ever higher prices for urban work permits, and reduce the supply-push
of low rural wages by accelerating rural growth.<p>
Even though unemployment in China is low--three percent of China's 160 million
urban workers are jobless--at least 100 million Chinese workers are considered
free to look for jobs because they are not needed on the farms to which they
are assigned, or they work for a state factory that has stopped paying them.
In Shanghai, where 400 state firms closed in 1995, laid off workers require an
average three years to find a new job.<p>
An inspection of joint venture operations in Shanghai found that many firms are
violating China's labor laws by forcing employees to work overtime, not giving
them contracts, and not paying insurance.  Many workers earn monthly salaries,
and they are supposed to be limited to 36 hours of overtime each month, but one
firm ordered its workers to work 80 hours of overtime--it received a fine of
3,000 yuan ($360). <p>

In September 1995, Libya announced that it was ending its dependence on foreign
workers to open up jobs for Libyans, and to reduce illegal immigration.  There
are believed to be one to two million foreigners and five million Libyans in
Libya.<p>
Libya began to expel Palestinians to expose "Israel's plan to create a
Palestine without Palestinians."  Libya has begun dismissing many of the 30,000
Palestinians from their jobs in Libya, confiscating their houses, and ordering
them to leave the country.  Libya's leader Qadafi says that he is not deporting
the Palestinians, but pushing them to return to their own country.
Unemployment in Libya is unofficially put at 30 percent, middle class salaries
have been steadily falling, and there is reported to be unrest.<p>
Egypt does not permit Palestinians without permission to enter Jordan or the
West Bank to enter its territory, which led to the creation of a camp on the
Libyan-Egyptian border that held 1,000 Palestinians in tents in mid-October.<p>
In mid-October, Libya asked the United Nations for permission to fly home up to
1.2 million foreigners from various African countries--Libya has been under a
UN air embargo since 1992.  By then, some 5,000 Palestinians, 13,000 Sudanese
and 7,000 Egyptians had been expelled from Libya.<p>
Libya told the UN that it wanted to fly home 500,000 Sudanese, 300,000
nationals of Chad, 250,000 persons from Mali, and others from Niger, Ghana,
Nigeria, Benin, Ivory Coast, Senegal, Guinea and Guinea-Bissau.  Diplomats said
that Libya ordered the foreigners expelled so that African countries would
support the country's request to lift or soften the UN sanctions.<p>
The foreigners in Libya include 8,000 hotel employees, 26,000 truck drivers,
70,000 masons, 300,000 factory workers and 500,000 agricultural workers.
Iraqis are reportedly eager to work in Libya--teachers can earn $200 per
month.<p>
Qadafi says that the foreign workers, who have no permits or identity cards,
may be allowed to return later because of the country's dependence upon them.

Israel is a country peopled largely by immigrants.  Since its establishment in
1948, some 2.5 million immigrants arrived, and 70,000 per year are expected to
arrive in the next decade, meaning that immigration will add 1.3 percent to its
5.5 million population every year via immigration, one of the highest rates of
immigration in the world.<p>
Some 700,000 immigrants, mostly from the ex-USSR, arrived in the past five
years.<p>
There are currently 72,000 mostly Thai and Romanian guest workers on two-year
contracts in Israel, including 43,000 in construction and 12,000 in
agriculture.  The Romanians report that the $550 monthly they earn in Israel is
almost six times the $100 monthly they could expect to earn at home.<p>
Israeli employers began to import Arab workers from the West Bank and Gaza
after the 1967 war.  At the peak, 120,000 Arab workers from these areas were
employed on a daily or weekly basis in Israel, including 72,000 legal commuter
workers.  Beginning in 1994, Israel turned to non-Arab foreign workers, after
failing to get unemployed Israelis to substitute for the banned Arab workers.
<p>
Some question Israel's replacement of Arabs with other foreign workers, arguing
that Israel can never be secure if it has thousands of unemployed Arabs on its
borders.  Even the new guest workers cause problems--Romanians have taken to
drinking beer in their off hours in Jerusalem.<p>
Each day in Gaza, a rectangle of 147 square miles, the 16,800 workers who do
have permits to work in Israel but are barred from entering Israel cost the
territory $1 to $2 million.  It has been estimated that each Arab worker
employed in Israel supports 20 dependents.<p>

Pakistan arrested or detained nearly 2,000 Bangladeshis the week of October 23
as the government imposed new rules to reduce illegal immigrants in Karachi,
where they are considered a "security risk." The government considers illegal
immigrants a threat because of their involvement in drug trafficking and
weapons and they are a drain on the country's limited social services and jobs.
<p>
Illegal immigrants make up about 16 percent of Karachi's 12 million
inhabitants.  About 80 percent of the immigrants are from Bangladesh.  <p>
The fishing industry is the largest employer, though some are employed as
domestic workers or set up roadside stands selling sugar cane juice or
cigarettes.  <p>
To keep immigrant workers out of the fishing industry, the government declared
that foreigners were not allowed in the harbor area without permission.  But
the government admits that it is difficult for employers to know who is legal
or illegal, especially since fake Pakistani identity cares and passports are
readily available. <p>
Work at the Karachi Harbor has come to a near standstill because more than
10,000 Bangladeshis, representing more than 60 percent of the harbor workforce,
have avoided work since October 21 for fear of being arrested.  <p>

New Zealand, a country of 3.5 million, announced revisions to its immigration
policies that will reduce the influx of immigrants, leading to charges that the
country is turning its back on Asians.  The official target for immigrants is
25,000 annually, but 50,000 immigrants arrived in the 12 months up to June
1995.<p>
Most New Zealand immigrants came from the UK and Australia until the 1990s.
Since 1990, South Africans and immigrants from Hong Kong, Taiwan, China, South
Korea, Japan, Malaysia and Singapore have arrived.  New Zealand is trying to
forge a bicultural system which recognizes the rights of the indigenous Maori,
who fear being swamped by Asian immigrants.<p>
Asian immigrants are criticized for using New Zealand to obtain cheap
English-language education's for their children.  According to critics, Asians
with established businesses deposit funds in New Zealand banks, move their
families to New Zealand, and then commute to Hong Kong or Singapore, using New
Zealand as a "bolt hole." New Zealand, it is alleged, is stuck with educating
the children of immigrants who do not intend to integrate.<p>
A recent survey found that more than half of the New Zealanders do not want
more Asian and Pacific Island immigrants.  Opposition to those from Australia,
Britain and South Africa is less, ranging from 15 to 24 percent.  The survey
found that the elderly and low-income New Zealanders are the least tolerant
toward immigrants. <p>
Beginning October 1, 1995, immigrants to New Zealand must post a bond of
US$13,000 that is forfeited if the principal immigrant cannot pass an English
test, and immigrants entering under the business investment program will have
to put at least one-fourth of their funds in a local enterprise, rather than
leaving it in certificates of deposit.<p>

Following a request form the National Union of Mineworkers, South African
President Nelson Mandela held talks with several senior government officials on
October 27 to determine if foreign mineworkers should be allowed to vote in the
November 1 local elections.  On October 28, he announced that the more than
90,000 mineworkers will be granted permanent residency.  The agreement was
reached to late to allow them to vote in the November 1 elections. <p>
The National Union of Mineworkers claimed that immigrants from European
countries were being favored over the mostly black migrant workers form
southern African nations.  The union says that the workers from other African
nations are being treated the same way they were under apartheid. <p>
According to the Chamber of Mines, more than 400,000 gold and coal miners are
employed in South Africa.  It estimated that 45 percent of its 1994 workforce
and 44 percent of its 1993 workforce were hired from outside the country,
primarily from southern Africa. <p>
The union challenged the Aliens Control Act, under which workers are entitled
to permanent status after five years of working in South Africa.  The union
argued that many black workers have worked in South Africa for 20 years and are
denied permanent status.<p>

The United Arab Emirates will not execute a Filipina maid who was found guilty
of killing her employer.  The maid claims that she killed her employer in
self-defense after he raped her.  <p>
The Philippines government is still working to secure her release from jail and
repatriation.   Although the death penalty has been dropped, the court may
impose a jail term and award damages to the family. <p>
There are an estimated 27,000 Filipino overseas contract workers in the UAE.
With a population of between 2.5-3 million, nearly 70 percent of the population
is foreign. Estimates from Asian embassies in Abu Dhabi and consular officials
in Dubai suggest there are more than 1.5 million Asian and Egyptian workers in
the UAE sending about $ 2.5 billion a year back to their own countries.  <p>
Many workers are recruited by illegal agencies who offer a sponsor to an
employee, but the employee may be passed along to yet another employer.  In the
UAE, it is particularly difficult because of the ruling sheikdoms of the seven
emirates often interpret federal legislation to suit themselves.  Federal
officials admit that the existing labor and immigration laws are not being
applied and it is only a matter of time before a crisis erupts. <p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC3">House
and Senate to Take on Immigration Bills</a></a></a></a></a> 
</a></h2>
<tt>In November, the full House prepared to take up the Immigration in the
National Interest bill, and in the Senate,<b> </b>Senator Alan Simpson (R-WY)
on November 3 introduced the Immigration Reform Act of 1995, S1394, to add
legal immigration reform to S269, Simpson's previous bill that dealt with
illegal immigration.  </tt><p>
<tt>On November 29, 1995, the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration
approved S1394 on a 5-2 vote, and sent the combined bill to the full Senate
Judiciary Committee for markup.</tt><p>
<tt>Both the House and Senate bills would reduce legal immigration, which was
804,416 in FY95 and take new steps to reduce illegal immigration--1.4<b>
</b>million aliens were apprehended in the US in FY95.</tt><p>
<tt>Simpson's S1394 would allow the entry of 450,000 family-sponsored
immigrants to per year (down from 535,000), plus 90,000 economic/employment
immigrants (down from 140,000), plus refugees.  Immediate relatives of US
citizens -  spouses, unmarried minor children and parents - could continue to
enter the US without restriction, but the definition of immediate relative
would be narrowed in one respect: parents 65 or older would qualify only if at
least half of their children live in the US.</tt><p>
<tt>A limit of 85,000 visas annually would be available for spouses and
unmarried minor children of legal immigrants who sponsor their
immigration.</tt><p>
<tt>There would no longer be visas for unskilled foreigners to fill vacant jobs
in the US.  American employers bringing foreign professionals to the US as
temporary workers to fill vacant jobs would be required to pay the prevailing
wage for that occupation and area, plus a fee of 10 percent of the foreign
worker's first year total compensation, or $10,000, whichever is higher, to a
private training fund that would prepare US workers to fill the foreigners'
jobs.</tt><p>
<tt>On November 13, a group of businesses led by the National Association of
Manufacturers held a news conference to protest Simpson's call for fees on
skilled foreign workers.  The NAM and the American Civil Liberties Union issued
a joint statement of opposition to Simpson's bill on November 29.</tt><p>
<tt>Some US employers see US universities as a "probationary system" from which
they can select the best and brightest foreigners as soon as they are
identified.  The Simpson bill initially would have required foreigners who
study in the US to return home for at least several years before seeking to
immigrate to the US, but this provision was dropped by November 29.</tt><p>
<tt>In early November, a group of California representatives called for the
House immigration bill to be split into parts dealing with legal and illegal
immigration.  Having two bills,<b> </b>observers believe, would slow the
momentum to reduce legal immigration levels.</tt><p>
<tt>In the House markup of the comprehensive revision of the laws governing
both legal and illegal immigration, much of the debate centered on provisions
that affect specific immigrants and businesses.  For example, the inclusion of
27,000 slots for "diversity immigrants" was widely considered a concession to
the Irish lobby and its representatives.  The mandatory national registry of
workers proposed in earlier versions of the bill was changed to a five-state
pilot that would apply to employers with four or more workers, a concession to
employers.</tt><p>
<tt>The House proposed few changes to permanent and temporary
economic/employment-based immigration.  However, there was a change sought by
employers in the much-criticized H-1B program, under which US employers
"attest" that they cannot find US workers to fill vacant jobs.</tt><p>
<tt>There were a number of newspaper accounts of US employers laying off US
workers to replace them with H-1B foreigners, especially in routine computer
programming.  To curb abuses by so-called "body shops" that employ mostly
Russian or Indian programmers for up to six years, the House bill says that, if
more than 15 or 20 percent of a company's labor force are H-1B workers, the
company is considered "dependent" on H-1B workers, and is subject to heightened
DOL oversight.  Non-dependent companies are subject to less DOL oversight.
</tt><p>
<tt>The welfare measures included in Congressional reforms would substitute
block grants administered by states for current federal entitlement programs
under which expenditures depended on the number of eligible persons who apply
for benefits.</tt><p>
<tt>Legal immigrants who are not US citizens would generally be ineligible for
food stamps and SSI.  Future legal immigrants would generally be ineligible for
most federal assistance for five years after their arrival, but states would
have the option of providing cash assistance and Medicaid to legal immigrants
currently in the US.</tt><p>
<tt>Congress dropped a ban on immigrants receiving federal assistance for
higher education at the behest of colleges that feared they would lose
students.  About 40,000 immigrant students at CCNY receive Pell grants, and
7,000 receive student loans.</tt><p>
<tt>Congress also permitted immigrant children to participate in Head Start,
but both their parents' income, as well as the income of whoever sponsored them
as immigrants, would be taken into account when determining eligibility for
benefits.</tt><p>
<tt>The Medicaid reforms in Congress would create a $627 million fund to cover
the cost of providing medical services to illegal aliens in the 15 states with
the most illegal aliens.  California spends $17 billion on Medi-Cal, the
California version of medical assistance for the poor, that serves about five
million persons.</tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC4">Parts
of Prop. 187 </a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>Unconstitutional</a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>A federal judge in Los Angeles declared most sections of Prop. 187
unconstitutional in a 72-page ruling issued on November 20, 1995.  According to
the judge, "The authority to regulate immigration belongs exclusively to the
federal government, and state agencies are not permitted to assume that
authority."  </tt><p>
<tt>Thus, California may not develop a system for having teachers, doctors, and
other service providers report suspected illegal aliens, and state efforts to
deny K-12 education to illegal alien children, or welfare benefits that are
partially federally funded, are unconstitutional.  California may deny illegal
aliens post-secondary education, and services that are completely state funded,
which means that California colleges and universities may be able to ask the
INS about an applicant's immigration status and deny admission to those who are
undocumented.</tt><p>
<tt>The judge's ruling means that the fate of Prop. 187 will be decided without
a trial, in which experts may have been called to testify about the number of
illegal immigrants, and the reasons why they come to the US and seek benefits.
</tt><p>
<tt>Governor Wilson on November 30 asked the Los Angeles judge to reconsider
that part of her ruling that prevents California from denying K-12 education to
illegal alien children.  According to Wilson, the US Supreme Court in its 1982
Plyer v Doe ruling said that Texas must educate unauthorized children because
the state presented no evidence that educating such children caused the state
any hardship.  Wilson asserted that California has such evidence--it estimates
the cost of educating unauthorized children at more than $1.5 billion
annually.</tt><p>
<tt>The State of California plans to appeal the judge's ruling, first to the
9th Circuit Court of Appeals, and eventually to the US Supreme Court.  Most the
provisions of Prop. 187 will not be implemented during the appeals
process.</tt><p>
<tt>Many observers believe that approval of Prop 187 in November 1994, plus
Congressional actions that restrict the access of non-US citizens to welfare
and other benefits, is responsible for the upsurge in applications for US
citizenship.  About one-third of the 25 million foreign-born persons in the US
are naturalized US citizens, and another 10 to 12 million are eligible to
naturalize.</tt><p>
<tt>There were 340,000 applications for US citizenship in FY92, 592,000 in
FY94, and a record one million in FY95.</tt><p>
<tt>A Los Angeles health clinic says that despite a seven-month campaign to
educate patients about Prop. 187, visits to the clinic remain 25 percent below
pre-Prop 187 levels.  Doctors in Los Angeles estimate that there has been a 40
percent drop in the number of women visiting the clinic during the first
trimester of pregnancy.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC5">INS</a></a></a></a>:
 Employee Verification and
Gatekeeper</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></></a></a></a></h2>
<tt>On October 31, the INS announced a pilot program in California that will
permit more than 200 small companies to verify the right to work of their
newly-hired employees by logging onto an INS database.  The INS plans to expand
the service to 1,000 employers in 1996.</tt><p>
<tt>Companies in Santa Ana and the City of Industry are voluntarily
participating in the screening.  Critics asserted that even though a worker's
documents are supposed to be checked only after the worker is hired, employers
would use the computer system to pre-screen workers.  </tt><p>
<tt>Under the pilot computer system, companies transmit the INS A-numbers of
immigrant workers, and they are told instantly whether the worker is legally
authorized to work in the US.  If the worker's A-number appears to be invalid,
the INS promises a check within three days.  If this second investigation also
finds that the number is invalid, the worker can continue to work for 30 days,
but must visit the INS to straighten out his or her status within that
period.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS on November 30 announced that it would accept proposals from
employers to complete the I-9 Employment Eligibility Verification Form
electronically.  US employers are asked to submit ideas for maintaining the
integrity of the check while reducing their paper work.</tt><p>
<tt>During a three-week test in Anaheim in October 1995, police questioned each
person arrested about their legal status, and 37 percent of the 750 persons
arrested admitted that they were in the US illegally.  The INS in Los Angeles
broke up a forged documents business that had materials on hand to create
79,000 false ID sets.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS continues to step up the number of aliens removed from the US.  In
FY95 the INS apprehended about 1.4 million aliens who were unlawfully in the
US.  Almost all left the US voluntarily, but 49,000 were removed, either by
being excluded from the US, or after deportation proceedings.  </tt><p>
<tt>Most of those who leave the US voluntarily, are excluded and deported are
Mexicans.  For example, 80 percent of the criminals removed, and 73 percent of
the non-criminals removed in October 1995 were Mexicans, followed by nationals
of Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala, and the Dominican Republic.</tt><p>
<tt>News articles on Operation Gatekeeper said that the INS had, in the $46
million initiative, succeeded in sharply cutting the influx of illegal aliens
in the westernmost section of the border with a three-tiered system of fences,
lights, and agents.  However, it is also clear that there are more illegal
entries further east, where the INS has not yet developed the three-tiered
border control system.</tt><p>
<tt>Residents in eastern San Diego, where apprehensions have jumped, are
reportedly so upset by aliens crossing their property that some have begun
taking vigilante actions against the aliens.  Local law enforcement officials
have warned residents not to shoot persons walking across their
property.</tt><p>
<tt>In late October, the Border Patrol moved to fire five agents--one who, in
November 1993, hit an alien over the head with a rock, and four who covered up
the incident.  The Border Patrol agent who told the truth about the incident
was threatened by other agents, and transferred away from the border for his
safety.  The Border Patrol agents' union is appealing the terminations.</tt><p>
<tt>In mid-November, the INS announced that it would have to close 25 interior
offices, including the INS office in Fresno, if Congress orders the agency to
put yet more agents on the border.  Critics noted that it appears that
Congressional Republicans would rather target Mexican workers at the border
than the US employers who hire them.</tt><p>

<tt>On October 30, 1995, Quebec voted 51 to 49 percent to remain part of
Canada--a switch of 25,000 votes would have led to a vote for separation.  Some
supporters of separation blamed non-French speaking minorities for voting to
remain part of Canada--the 82 percent of Quebec's seven million residents who
speak French mostly supported separation, while the 18 percent who do not speak
French mostly opposed it.</tt><p>
<tt>Quebec's premier blamed the narrow defeat on "money and the ethnic vote."
He later said his remarks were too harsh but did not retract them.  He resigned
later in the week.  Quebec's deputy premier surrendered his cabinet post as
immigration minister on November 10 after a newspaper reported he had yelled at
a Latina hotel desk clerk after the vote-- blaming her and her fellow
immigrants for the defeat of the independence referendum.  </tt><p>
<tt>Since the vote, many minority residents are concerned about the future,
expecting that the next general election in two years will bring another
separatist referendum.</tt><p>
<tt>Quebec absorbed 212,413 immigrants from 1990 to 1994, and only 11,747 came
from France.  Lebanon, Hong Kong and Haiti sent the largest numbers.  After the
vote, many immigrants in Quebec reportedly plan to leave Quebec for other
provinces.</tt><p>
<tt>Quebec accounts for about 25 percent of Canada's population and 22 percent
of its GDP.  A 1980 referendum resulted in 60 percent of Quebec voters voting
to stay in Canada.</tt><p>
<tt>US House of Representative Speaker Newt Gingrich said on October 30 that
the referendum was a "warning" to Americans about the dangers of a bilingual
society.  He said that the possible split in Canada may give impetus to the
"English First" movement in the US.</tt><p>
<tt>Canada on November 17 announced changes in its system for selecting about
25,000 skilled immigrants annually, and their 35,000 dependents.  The purpose
of the changes is to encourage the immigration of persons who have enough
education to quickly change occupations, and minimize competition with young
and unemployed Canadians.  </tt><p>
<tt>The unemployment rate in Canada is 9.4 percent, and almost 16 percent for
persons under 25.  Unemployment peaked in 1990-92, when 1.5 million persons
were unemployed.  Today, there are about 1.4 million unemployed Canadians,
despite adding 1.4 million jobs, because 1.3 million workers joined the labor
force.</tt><p>
<tt>Under the revised point system, immigrants seeking to come to Canada
through the point system would receive up to 20 percent of the maximum number
of points for education, 20 percent for English or French, more points for
persons 25 to 35 to avoid competing with under-25 year old Canadians.  The top
five sources of skilled worker immigration to Canada are Hong Kong, China, UK,
Philippines, and South Africa.</tt><p>
<tt>The changes affect about 40 percent of the immigrants who arrive in
non-Quebec Canada; Quebec has its own immigrant selection system. </tt><p>
<tt>Some Canadians who endorsed NAFTA hope to increase Mexican migration to
Canada.  Mexico has expanded summer programs under which up to 10,000 Mexicans
come to Canada to learn English or French, and some universities are recruiting
Mexican students.</tt><p>
<tt>Canada plans to strengthen its affirmative action program with Bill C-64,
expected to be approved in 1996.  Under Canada's Federal Employment Equity Act
of 1986, four groups of persons are afforded affirmative action
protection--women, who were 46 percent of the Canadian labor force in 1991, and
held 46 percent of the jobs covered by the current law; some nine percent of
the labor force were 'visible minorities,' and held eight percent were in jobs
covered by the Employment Equity Law; aboriginals, one percent of the labor
force; and disabled persons, 2.6 percent.  </tt><p>
<tt>Almost 80 percent of the 1.9 million visible minorities in Canada's labor
force are immigrants.  For example, Chinese-Canadians are about 26 percent of
Canada's visible minorities, and 81 percent are immigrants.  Indeed, over
three-fourths of the visible minorities covered by Canadian affirmative action
are immigrants, and almost half of them arrived within the past decade.</tt><p>
<tt>Canada's affirmative action law grew out of the Abella Royal Commission on
Equality in Employment in 1983.  The Abella Commission recommended that
affirmative action be based on Canada's 1983 Charter of Rights and Freedoms,
which permits discrimination to ameliorate "conditions of disadvantaged
individuals or groups."</tt><p>
<tt>In Ontario, a year-old affirmative action program based on workers
self-reporting their status to establish firm-by-firm employment goals is under
attack and may be repealed.  The NDP government approved an employment equity
program in September 1994, but the new provincial government has announced that
it plans to repeal the legislation.</tt><p>

Economic Uncertainty</a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>On October 29, the Mexican government announced a new pacto, the Alliance
for Economic Recuperation, a government, employer, and union agreement to link
growth, inflation, and wage increases.  The pacto projects real growth of three
percent in 1996, and an inflation rate of 20 percent.  In 1995, the Mexican
economy is expected to shrink by six percent, and inflation is expected to be
50 percent.</tt><p>
<tt>Mexico has a series of minimum wages, and the pacto would raise most
minimum wages by 20 percent to about $3 per day at a $1 to 7 peso exchange
rate.</tt><p>
<tt>On November 8, the Mexican peso reached a low of 7.8 pesos=$1.  Short-term
interest rates rose to 54 percent, threatening to prolong Mexico's recession.
Despite more privatizations, Mexico expects to attract only $5 billion in FDI
in 1996.</tt><p>
<tt>Since 1987, Mexico has used pactos to establish its macroeconomic policies.
The exchange rate was used as an anti-inflation policy, which means that Mexico
allowed the peso to depreciate against the dollar, but not enough to compensate
for Mexico's much higher inflation rate.  This too-slow peso devaluation
allowed the peso to become overvalued in 1994, which in turn encouraged Mexican
companies to buy foreign companies and foreign machinery.  </tt><p>
<tt>Mexico could buy more from other countries than it sold to them because
foreigners poured money into Mexico in the hope that it would be the world's
next fast-growing economy.  Shocks in 1994, such as political assassinations,
would normally have led to faster devaluation, but were not permitted to do so,
in part because of the presidential election campaign.</tt><p>
<tt>Mexico has a much lower savings rate than the Asian Tiger economies--
savings are only 16 percent of GDP in Mexico-- causing Mexico to rely on
foreigners' savings to finance development, and thus making Mexico vulnerable
to wild swings in investment, interest rates, and the value of the peso.  In an
effort to increase savings, the October 29 pacto includes reforms of Mexico's
52-year old social security system (IMSS), which currently has about 10 million
worker-members and, with their families, covers some 39 million
Mexicans.</tt><p>
<tt>The comprehensive IMSS provides health care, pensions of $2 per day after
age 65, and offers a number of other services, from theaters to discount
stores.  When it was established, the average Mexican lived to be less than 50,
so that funds were available to establish a hospitals and clinics and provide
other services as contributions exceeded expenditures.  Today, Mexicans live to
be 70, on average, and it is estimated that, by 2002, payouts and expenses will
exceed employer and worker contributions.</tt><p>
<tt>Workers and employers contributed about 25 percent of gross pay to IMSS;
for a clerk earning $185 per month, the IMSS contribution is about $45, of
which the worker pays $11.  The reform announced October 29 would permit
workers to establish Individual Retirement Accounts rather than join the IMSS,
and permit self-employed persons, and those in the informal economy, to join
IMSS.</tt><p>
<tt>The IMSS lost one million members in 1995 as workers lost their jobs, and
there are few jobs for workers joining the labor force this year.</tt><p>
<tt>The economic recession in Mexico has highlighted severe rural poverty in
Chiapas, Guerrero, Puebla, Oaxaza, Hidalgo, Veracruz, Michoacan, and Durango.
By one estimate, four million Mexican children under the age of five are
malnourished.</tt><p>
<tt>US interest in and concern about Mexico has grown sharply since NAFTA went
into effect on January 1, 1994.  Most experts argue that NAFTA did more than
simply ratify inevitable economic integration, but it did not give Mexicans and
Americans a sense that their fates are intertwined in the manner in which the
EU links the fates of Europeans in member countries.</tt><p>
<tt>The number of maquiladoras rose to 2,600 by the end of 1995; some 600,000
Mexicans work in these foreign-owned assembly plants in the border area.  About
40 percent of US-Mexican trade in manufactured goods is within one firm, as
when Sony sends picture tubes to the Mexican maquiladora that makes TVs, and
imports the finished televisions into the US.</tt><p>
<tt>Each NAFTA country has established a National Advisory Committee to
implement the labor side agreement to NAFTA.  The 12-member US NAO met for the
first time in November 1995, and discussed tackling issues that include child
labor and migrant workers.  The US NAO has a fax-on-demand service to provide
information on the labor side agreement: (202) 273-3454 or (202)
273-4315.</tt><p>
<tt>As a result of complaints about Sony's firing of union activists in April
1994 at its Nuevo Laredo factory, a tripartite meeting on union registration
and certification procedures was held November 8-9, 1995 in San Antonio.  The
fired workers attempted to field an opposition slate of candidates in a union
election and, when that failed, they called for a wildcat strike.  The fired
workers accepted severance pay from Sony.</tt><p>
<tt>Mexico's Labor Ministry allegedly failed to recognize the independent union
that Sony's workers wanted to organize and, with the support of the established
union affiliated with the dominant Mexican union federation CTM, Sony fired the
union activists for not being union members of the recognized union.</tt><p>
<tt>Mexican unions have supported a complaint by 235 Hispanic workers who lost
their jobs when Sprint closed a facility near San Francisco just before an
election in which the Communications Workers of America sought to represent
them.</tt><p>
<tt>Between January 1, 1994 and September 30, 1995, the Labor Department
certified 42,221 US workers as eligible for TAA assistance.  Of those, 31,876
were declared eligible in fiscal year 1995, compared with 10,345 in the first
nine months of 1994. </tt><p>
<tt>The Labor Department has certified workers as eligible for NAFTA-TAA
benefits in 317 of the 589, or about 54 percent, of the petitions filed and
reviewed since January 1, 1994.  Cases in which US workers lost jobs because
production shifted to Mexico include Niagara Mohawk Power Corp. of Syracuse,
New York, which displaced 2,600 workers; Regency Packing Co. of Naples,
Florida, (1,334 workers); Woodward Governor Co. of Stevens Point, Wisconsin
(1,330 workers); Lockheed of Fort Worth, Texas (1,200 workers); Louisiana
Pacific Corp. of Portland, Oregon (1,143 workers); Copper Range Co. of White
Pine, Michigan (1,133 workers).</tt><p>
<tt>The top three US imports from Mexico so far in 1995 are electrical
machinery, equipment and parts ($5.2 billion in 1995), Mexican oil ($4.1
billion), and vehicles ($4.3 billion).</tt><p>
<tt>Mexico's government noted and rejected a resolution passed by California's
Republican party that asked Mexico not to implement dual nationality.  Under
the proposal being considered by Mexico's Congress, Mexicans could retain their
right to own and inherit property in Mexico even if they became US
citizens.</tt><p>
<tt>There have been fears that some of the 1.3 million Mexicans apprehended in
the US each year would apply for asylum to obtain the right to work at least
temporarily in the US.  However, no Mexicans who applied for asylum were
approved between 1990 and 1993.  In FY95, some 9,300 Mexicans applied for
asylum in the US, and 54 were granted asylum, including environmentalists and
government critics.  </tt><p>
<tt>At the end of November, corruption in Mexico was highlighted when the wife
of the brother of ex-President Salinas was arrested in Geneva attempting to
withdraw some of the $84 million Raul Salinas had deposited there under a
different name.  Even though Raul Salinas never reported more than $192,000 per
year in income, he managed to acquire a number of properties in Mexico, plus
bank deposits in Switzerland and elsewhere.  According to the Mexican Attorney
General, 80 percent of the federal judicial police are corrupt.</tt><p>

<tt>US officials in Bangkok estimate that 2,000 people each month--Thais,
Chinese, and Indians and Pakistanis--are smuggled to the US via Bangkok.  In
many cases, US employers and brothel owners finance the illegal entry, which
can cost up to $35,000.  The illegal workers then pay off the debt by working
in the US.</tt><p>
<tt>According to US authorities, some Thai travel agents specialize in
supplying false travel documents to Thais seeking US tourist visas, and corrupt
Thai immigration and airline employees help them to leave the country.  The US
has begun a crackdown on illegal aliens at the source--in Bangkok.</tt><p>
<tt>A Chinese woman who was smuggled into New York by boat for $29,000 in 1994
was killed by Chinese gangs in New York after her family in China did not pay
the $38,000 ransom they demanded when they kidnapped her in 1995.  </tt><p>
<tt>The case illustrates the relative ease with which families in the Fujian
region of China, where per capita incomes are less than $500 per year, raise
the equivalent of 60 years local earnings to send a family member illegally to
the US.</tt><p>
<tt>Most illegal Chinese immigrants to the US come from three counties outside
Fuzhou, the capital of Fujian province, largely because of the ready
availability of smugglers, and the means<b> </b>and willingness to pay them --
in part from remittances from those in the US.</tt><p>
<tt>The case also illustrated the dangers faced by such illegal aliens in the
US.  Competing "snakehead" gangs that smuggle Chinese aliens into the US
sometimes kidnap illegal Chinese immigrants, as in this case, and then demand
ransom from relatives in China.</tt><p>
<tt>There are reports that the Chinese exodus to the US is waning primarily
because there are fewer Chinese taking the risk of placing themselves in the
hands of smugglers who often exploit them.  The Chinese government claims that
a massive education campaign on the dangers of smuggling is responsible for the
decline.  After the Golden Venture fiasco, dozens of smugglers were arrested
and imprisoned by the Chinese government. </tt><p>
<tt>The main result of the crackdown on smugglers is that fewer Chinese are
leaving by boat.  With more money, those wishing to go to the US can pay to fly
first to Central American or the Caribbean, then on to Puerto Rico, and finally
to the US.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC9">Skilled
Foreign Workers in
US</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></></a></a></a></h2>
<tt>Debate has been increasing in the US about whether skilled foreign workers
who are recruited to work in the US are displacing American workers.  The
debate is also raising the issue of whether America is producing enough
home-grown scientists and engineers.  </tt><p>
<tt>The Center for Immigration Studies in Washington DC reports that 12 percent
of America's scientists and engineers in 1990 were foreign-born professionals.
Many of the foreign science and engineering students in US universities remain
in the US after graduation.  The National Science Foundation reports that 49
percent of the PhDs in computer science in 1993 were awarded to foreigners, up
from 36 percent in 1983.  </tt><p>
<tt>Corporations and universities argue that the US does not have enough
skilled workers to fill all the jobs offered, and that, to keep the US economy
competitive, US companies must have easy access to the world's best and
brightest.</tt><p>
<tt>Companies<b> </b>may not ask for foreign workers if American workers are
available.  But many companies get around that law by writing job descriptions
tailored to fit particular foreign candidates.  The most well-documented cases
of US worker displacement occur in routine software programming.  There,
temporary H-1B visa workers have undercut some US programmers. </tt><p>
<tt>Foreign doctors provide a classic example of the dilemmas involved in
reversing the incentives to employ foreigners in a particular occupation and
area.  About 149,000 foreign-born doctors are practicing in the US, making them
about 20 percent of all US doctors.  In recent years, about 25,000 foreigners
have entered the US each year for medical training .  Some 75 to 90 percent
stay in the US by agreeing to practice in "medically underserved" areas,
usually by obtaining visa waivers from federal agencies, even though foreigners
who enter the US for medical education must sign a pledge to leave.  </tt><p>
<tt>According to critics, the federal policy of paying $150,000 per for each
doctor in training, regardless of his/her nationality, has encouraged hospitals
in the inner cities and rural areas to depend on foreign medical school
graduates.  The hospitals that employ foreign doctors argue that only foreign
doctors are willing to provide medical care in these areas.</tt><p>
<tt>Doctors' median incomes dropped in 1994 to $150,000, while the median
household income of all Americans rose slightly to $32,264 in 1994.  One reason
why doctors' incomes fell is that the number of doctors more than doubled
between 1965 and 1995, from 266,000 to 661,000.  Despite the addition of
150,000 doctors over the past decade, the number of medically underserved areas
has increased.</tt><p>
<tt>A panel of experts has recommended reducing the number of slots in medical
schools by 20 to 25 percent over the next decade.  In 1994, there were some
45,000 applicants for 16,000 slots in US medical schools.  There were 23,500
international medical graduates in training in US medical schools in 1994, and
the report urged their number to be reduced.</tt><p>
<tt>In Calexico, California, a town on the US-Mexican border about 100 miles
east of San Diego, Filipina nurses recruited under the Nurses Relief Act of
1989, which expired on September 30, 1995, were placed at a hospital that went
bankrupt, leaving them unpaid.  The 10 nurses were recruited by Gems
International in Manila; each paid Gems $3,500, plus 10 percent of their first
year's wages, for transportation and fees.  Gems has since gone out of
business, although its president is operating another recruitment
agency.</tt><p>
<tt>Under the NRA, nurses must stay with the hospital that recruited them or
find their visas invalidated.  It was this requirement that reportedly kept the
Filipina nurses in Calexico even though they were not being paid
regularly.</tt><p>
<tt>Presidential candidate Pat Buchanan has latched onto the issue of foreign
workers in his campaign.  He says that low-wage immigrants and low-wage foreign
workers compete with native-born Americans and drive wages down.  His solution
is to restrict immigration and imports. </tt><p>
<tt>The au pair program, which grants 10,000 young Europeans 13-month visas to
care for children in US homes, lapsed temporarily in October 1995, prompting
protests from families that were counting on the arrival of au pairs.  Under
this "cultural exchange" program, European girls aged 18 to 25 are recruited
through one of eight US agencies and matched with US families willing to pay an
agency fee and travel expenses of about $4,000, plus $115 per week, but no
Social Security or other payroll taxes.</tt><p>
<tt>The cost of an au pair is about $200 per week over 13 months, or about
$10,000 annually, versus $300 per week, plus payroll taxes and benefits, or
$15,000 to $20,000, for US nannies.  Complaints from US nannies about unfair
competition, and questions about the cultural exchange value of child care
duties of up to 45 hours per week, prompted changes in the program that require
au pairs to receive at least 32 hours of training, and to take at least six
hours of courses at a US college or university.</tt><p>

<tt>Between November 15 and 30, over 1,100 Haitians were stopped in boats en
route to Florida.  By comparison, only about 300 Haitians were picked up
between the time 20,000 US troops entered Haiti in October 1994 and November
15, 1995.  Haitians are reportedly paying smugglers up to $3,000 each to be
taken to the US.  The 6,000 UN troops in Haiti are scheduled to leave in
February 1996.</tt><p>
<tt>The fifth round of bilateral negotiations between the United States and
Cuba ended on November 28, 1995.  Cuba and the US were unable to agree to a
reduction in the $750 fee imposed on Cubans who want to emigrate to the US.
Cuban sources said they will seek to maintain the previously agreed upon 20,000
minimum of US visas to be granted annually to Cubans who wish to emigrate to
the US.  </tt><p>
<tt>The countries also failed to agree upon the fate of 1,200 Cubans in US
detention centers who arrived during the 1980 Mariel boatlift.  The US claims
that the detainees have criminal backgrounds; Havana counters that the US
government is exaggerating the criminal background of the detainees.  At the
July talks, Cuba pledged to continue to prevent a mass exodus of Cubans bound
for the US.</tt><p>
<tt>In the past 10 months, the US government issued more than 24,000 entry
visas to Cubans.  The US promised to grant at least 20,000 immigration visas
per year to Cubans in 1994. </tt><p>
<tt>The Cuban economy has shrunk by almost one-third since 1990, including a 15
percent drop in GDP in 1993.  Cuba has opened its door to foreign investors to
stimulate its economy, and keep migrants at home, but its efforts to attract
foreign businesses have been hampered by anti-business regulations and
attitudes.  Since 1990, about $737 million in foreign investment has been
announced--one third is from Mexico, and another third is from Spain and
Canada.</tt><p>
<tt>At the end of a conference in Havana on "The Nation and Migration," the
Cuban government announced that the 1.2 million overseas Cubans will be able to
obtain travel documents that would allow then to come and go as they please for
up to two years.  Cubans abroad send an estimated $400 million to the island.
</tt><p>
<tt>There are about 11 million Cubans; they represent about one-third of the
population of the Caribbean.  There are about two million Cubans living off the
island; half are in the US.</tt><p>
<tt>Cubans can exchange their pesos for dollars, in Cuba's increasingly
dollarized economy, at a mid-November rate of 25 to 30 pesos for $1.  An
average salary in Cuba is 125 pesos per month.</tt><p>
<tt>While foreigners are in theory allowed to buy land, the Cuban constitution
prohibits the sale of land, so foreigners must lease rather than buy the land
on which their facilities sit.  Foreign businesses are required to pay their
Cuban workers in dollars at the official $1 to 1 peso rate, although the black
market rate is $1 to 25 pesos.  The Cuban government pays workers employed by
foreign businesses in pesos, and pockets the difference.</tt><p>
<tt>There is widespread agreement that the US embargo on trade with Cuba will
soon be lifted; former Treasury Secretary Lloyd Benston, among others, asserted
that if the US can lift the embargo on Vietnam, where American soldiers lost
their lives, it can resume trade with Cuba.  US businessmen are visiting Cuba,
and signing letters of intent to do business there if the embargo is
lifted.</tt><p>
<tt>Canadian mining and other businesses already operating in Cuba report that
the educated Cuban labor force can run high-productivity facilities with few
expatriate managers--Cuba's literacy rate is reported to be higher than
Canada's.  However, it is reportedly difficult to make long-term business plans
because the legal and regulatory framework is still evolving--the Cuban peso
was made convertible in 1993, a Central Bank was established in 1994, and the
foreign investment law was approved in 1995.  </tt><p>
<tt>Some 200,000 Cubans have taken advantage of the right to be self-employed,
but they are so far prohibited from hiring employees, a prohibition that may be
dropped in 1996.</tt><p>
<tt>The integration of Cuba into the North American economy is expected to have
repercussions throughout the Caribbean.  Several of the larger Caribbean
nations, including the Dominican Republic and Haiti, which together have over
40 percent of the Caribbean's 36 million people, fear that current US interest
and investment may move to Cuba.  In some Caribbean nations, 10 to 20 percent
of the population born on the island lives in the US.</tt><p>

<tt>At a November 27 and 28 development conference with the 15 members of the
EU and 12 southern and eastern Mediterranean neighbors, Mediterranean countries
agreed to try to curb the flow of immigrants to the north.  Dubbed the
Barcelona Declaration, the agreement was part of a blueprint for increasing
economic progress in the Mediterranean basin through increased trade and
political cooperation.</tt><p>
<tt>Germany had pressed to have the Mediterranean nations agree to take back
their nationals who were caught working illegally in the northern European
countries.  The final wording speaks not of an obligation to take back
nationals, but of a vaguer responsibility to accept the return of nationals
apprehended in Europe--" the partners, aware of their responsibility for
readmissision, agree to adopt the relevant provisions and measures, by means of
bilateral agreements or arrangements, in order to readmit their nationals who
are in an illegal situation."</tt><p>
<tt>German officials said they will continue to pursue the matter in bilateral
talks. </tt><p>
<tt>As the officials argued over the final Barcelona Declaration, about 5,000
people marched through the city streets protesting the "wall of shame" the EU
is creating in immigration. </tt><p>
<tt>The final declaration called for the establishment of an EU-Mediterranean
free trade area by 2010, and $6 billion in EU aid to its Mediterranean
neighbors.  Algeria and Egypt pressed to have agriculture included in the
proposed free trade clause, but the EU rejected their request.  Algeria's
foreign minister asserted that "The EU's common agricultural policy is
protectionist so you cannot talk about free trade and block a part of
commercial activity."</tt><p>
<tt>The EU has a GDP of $7 trillion; the 12 southern and eastern Mediterranean
nations have a GDP of about $400 million.</tt><p>
<tt>Germany and France are working on a four-point plan for the next round of
European integration, which includes a proposal to yield more immigration and
asylum powers to Brussels.  The initiative will be finalized at the December 7
Franco-German summit. </tt><p>
<tt>The European Commission would draw up laws on visas and asylum rights, and
ensure they are enforced.  The European Court of Justice would rule on cases
where EU law had not been properly applied.  France is reluctant to cede
immigration authority to the EU.</tt><p>
<tt>The EU's Justice and Home Affairs Council issued a list of 100 countries
that will face strict visa requirements for the next six months.  Bulgaria and
Romania are the two of the six former Communist nations on the
blacklist.</tt><p>
<tt>The Bulgarian parliament requested that Bulgaria be removed from the list.
The Bulgarian government is especially concerned because Bulgaria would like to
join the EU.  The parliament said that the removal of Bulgaria from the list
will support democracy and economic reform in the country.  </tt><p>
<tt>The EU signed an accord on November 11 with Morocco that will be combined
with similar deals with Tunisia and Israel to form the cornerstone of the
future Euro-Mediterranean free trade area.  Illegal immigration has been a
sticking point because the diplomats argue that the issue is out of place in
the Morocco accord.  Therefore, the ministers compromised, agreeing that
countries should be allowed to negotiate individually with Rabat about
immigration.  </tt><p>
<tt>On December 1-2, the EU is scheduled to tackle the smuggling of prostitutes
into Western Europe.  The International Organisation for Migration reports that
most of the women are Eastern Europeans are under 25, and smuggled into Western
Europe by gangs.</tt><p>
<tt>One million foreigners became nationals of one of the present 15 EU member
nations between 1990 and 1993, according to Eurostat, the EC statistical office
in Luxembourg.  Most of those naturalized in Europe were from Morocco, Turkey,
or ex-Yugoslavia.  France naturalized the most foreigners-- 233,000--followed
by the UK, with 218,000; Benelux, 204,000, Germany, 129,000, and Sweden,
116,000.</tt><p>
<tt>The number of naturalizations doubled between 1981 and 1993.  Most of those
naturalized were from non-EU nations, rather than e.g., Germans opting for
French nationality--only nine percent, or 26,000, of the 290,000
naturalizations in 1993 were citizens of one EU nation who were naturalized in
another.</tt><p>
<tt>In France and Germany - traditional destinations for migrant workers -
rates of naturalization for the most populous groups (Algerian, Moroccan and
Portuguese in France, Turkish in Germany) remain low.  There has been a sharp
rise in the number of Asians naturalized in Sweden--most arrived as refugees -
-a development not observed elsewhere in the EU.  The UK had the highest
percentage of Asians who naturalized - nearly 18,000 or a third of the EU

<a name="RTFToC13">British
Immigration
Plan</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>After the November 15 Queen's Speech, Home Secretary Michael Howard
announced a new crackdown on bogus asylum seekers and seven-year jail terms for
those who violate immigration law, such as marriage brokers.  Howard also
announced that asylum seekers who come from neighboring third countries, such
as Germany or France, will be returned to those countries within 24 hours.
Asylum seekers wishing to appeal will have to remain in the third country, and
will not be allowed to return to Britain during the appeal process.</tt><p>
<tt>In a newspaper article outlining his reforms on November 20, Howard said
that Britain "should be a haven (for refugees), not a honey pot."</tt><p>
<tt>The immigration package also includes employer sanctions: employers would
be required to check the immigration status of new hires and makes it a
criminal offense to hire illegal aliens.  Employers are displeased with the
measures, especially the criminal sanctions.  One business leader argued during
a television interview that the new rules would dissuade employers form hiring
any new workers.  </tt><p>
<tt>As expected, the Home Office confirmed that the bill will include a "white
list" of countries that the UK government deems safe.  Although the final list
has not been released, Howard has confirmed that Nigeria, Algeria and Sri Lanka
are not included.  The first safe countries on the list are expected to include
Poland, Romania and Bulgaria; India and Pakistan; states of the former Soviet
Union; and some countries in South America and Africa.</tt><p>
<tt>Labour's Tony Blair called for the bill to be referred to a Commons
standing committee, and for expert witness testimony to deflate the "race
card," instead of having the bill considered in the charged atmosphere of the
Commons.  Although initially sympathetic to Labor's proposal, Prime Minister
John Majors rejected the idea, according to Labor, to make the Labour Party
appear to be soft on immigration.</tt><p>
<tt>On November 2, it was revealed that Home Secretary Howard, who has
steadfastly said that British immigration policy will be decided in Britain,
had secretly agreed with other European ministers on a coordinated immigration
and asylum policy.  Two key proposals in the Immigration and Asylum Bill were
agreed to behind closed doors in 1992.  The first of the proposals was the
development of the "white list," which was adopted by EU home affairs ministers
in London in 1992.  </tt><p>
<tt>The second proposal - the abolition of full appeal rights to those refugees
arriving via a safe third country - appears in an EU resolution, adopted by
Howard in Luxembourg in June.  The Home Office said in response that the
resolutions were agreed to because they did not conflict with proposals for
stopping illegal immigration to Britain.</tt><p>
<tt>At a November 23 European Union meeting in Brussels, Howard voted against a
set of far-reaching proposals aimed at stopping racist violence in Europe.  The
British Home Secretary's lone veto was enough to block the resolution, drawn up
over the past several month within the Council of Ministers.  </tt><p>
<tt>The measures defeated included: enacting laws in each member state to
confiscate racist or inflammatory publications, videos, films and TV programs,
a European wide intelligence center to monitor extremist activities, and
enacting uniform penalties for racist materials.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC14">Italian
Immigration Decree</a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>Prime Minister Lamberto Dini issued an emergency decree on November 16
which would permit the expulsion from Italy of non-EU citizens who commit
crimes within six to 10 days.  </tt><p>
<tt>The decree tightens loopholes in the five-year old Martelli law.  Under
that law, only about one-sixth of the illegal immigrants served with expulsion
orders left the country.  There are approximately 500,000 illegal immigrants,
and another one million foreigners living legally in Italy.  </tt><p>
<tt>Reaction to the decree was split.  The far-right felt that the decree did
not go far enough, and urged Dini to arrest all illegal immigrants and
immediately expel them from the country.  One Northern League party member
suggested returning illegal immigrants in air force transport planes, and
parachuting them into their country of origin.  </tt><p>
<tt>The Northern League, who holds the parliamentary balance of power, walked
out on November 17, and threatened to withdraw from Parliament to protest the
weak immigration law.  This could have led to the fall of Dini's 10-month old
government.  </tt><p>
<tt>The Italian president signed the measure on November 18 which, effective
immediately, allows the deportation of illegal immigrants and makes employers
who hire them liable to fines.  The decree permits undocumented aliens who have
jobs in Italy to regularize their status within four months.  The decree must
be approved by Parliament within 60 days. </tt><p>
<tt>The left wing parties do not agree with immediate expulsion, and the
Catholic Church urged tolerance and finding a way to solve the problems
creating immigration. </tt><p>
<tt>Foreign language teachers from Spain, Germany, and France have sued Italy
under the freedom of movement clause (Article 48) for failing to provide the
foreigners with the same benefits as Italian teachers.  The specific complaint
is that, under Italian law, working mothers are guaranteed 80 percent of their
salary for five months after birth, with employers paying the remaining 20
percent.  Italian universities pay the 20 percent for Italians, but not for
foreigners.</tt><p>
<tt>Foreign language teachers in Italy are usually hired under private
contracts, which provide fewer protections and benefits than the public
contracts under which Italian teachers are hired.  The European Court of
Justice has twice ruled in favor of the teachers, and against the Italian
universities.</tt><p>

<h3>
<a name="RTFToC16">Asylum
Seekers</a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h3>
<tt>After July 1, 1993, asylum seekers who passed through safe third
countries--all Germany's neighbors--en route to Germany could not file
applications for asylum in Germany, since they could have requested asylum in
the first safe country that they reached.  As one result, many asylum seekers
declared that they did not know how they got to Germany--they reported that
they were put in a truck container in Romania, and stepped out in
Germany.</tt><p>
<tt>Lawyers for asylum seekers argued that, in such cases, asylum applicants
have the right to seek asylum in Germany unless the government can prove that
the asylum seeker in fact passed through a safe country en route to Germany.
This would have rendered the "safe third country" clause ineffective, since it
would have been very hard to prove exactly how any particular asylum seeker
reached Germany.</tt><p>
<tt>On November 7, 1995, an administrative court in Berlin ruled that the
burden of proof is on the alien, not the government.  In other words, the
government can assume that the alien passed through a safe third country en
route to Germany if he or she arrived by land, even if the alien claims not to
know how he entered Germany.  </tt><p>
<tt>Lawyers began an appeal in the Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe on
November 21 in the case of five foreigners whose asylum appeals were rejected
because they arrived into Germany via safe third countries.  A ruling in the
case is not expected until February, 1996.  </tt><p>
<tt>German courts ruled that civil wars are not sufficient grounds to prevent
the repatriation of individuals whose requests for political asylum have been
rejected. repatriating individuals whose requests for political asylum have
been rejected.  The Berlin-based Federal Administrative Court ruled in late
October that the "general dangers and consequences" of civil wars ought not
deter German immigration authorities from sending rejected asylum-seekers back
to their native lands - unless the individual faces "targeted inhumane
treatment" from the government in his/her native land or from a "state-like
authority" there.  </tt><p>
<tt>Rejected asylum seekers may not be returned home if the individual would
face "concrete, serious danger."  This ruling came in the case of a man seeking
refuge from the civil war in Afghanistan, who argued that bombing raids and
food shortages endangered his family.  The court ruled that the dangers of
civil war were not directed at him specifically, and therefore he did not have
an adequate basis for an asylum claim.  </tt><p>
<tt>The CDU proposed at the party conference that the Schengen accord be
extended to cover the rest of Europe.  The proposed additions would include,
former Eastern Bloc nations, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Switzerland, and
Malta. </tt><p>
<tt>The number of asylum seekers in Germany increased slightly in October.  A
total of 12,389 people applied for asylum in October compared with 12,065 in
September--one third were from ex-Yugoslavia and Turkey.  The number of asylum
seekers is up for the first 10 months of 1995 compared with 1994.</tt><p>
<tt>In 1994, about 31,000 foreigners were prevented from entering Germany,
mostly at Polish and Czech border crossings, down from 54,000 in 1993.  Between
January and July 1995, some 4500 aliens who arrived at Frankfurt airport were
prevented from entering Germany.

<h3>
<a name="RTFToC17">Foreign
Workers in Construction</a></a></a></a>
</a></h3>
<tt>The German cabinet on September 1, 1995 approved a proposal that would
require foreign firms sending workers to Germany to pay those foreign workers
at least as much as the minimum wage negotiated between German unions and
employers.  On November 30, Germany's Bundestag approved the proposal.</tt><p>
<tt>However, the equal pay law will not go into effect unless a wage commission
comprised of equal numbers of employer and union representatives approves.
Employers are reportedly reluctant to approve, since approval would, some fear,
open the door to a minimum wage.</tt><p>
<tt>The EU Social Affairs Council is scheduled to discuss similar EU proposals,
COM(91)230 and COM(93)225, on December 5, 1995, but EU member nations remain
deadlocked over whether local wages should be paid from day one, as Germany
insists, or after 10 to 30 days, as Ireland and Italy prefer.  France and
Belgium already require EU workers posted to France to earn at least French
wages from their first day in the country, the so-called zero option.</tt><p>
<tt>According to German unions, some construction firms, and the government,
equal pay for local and foreign workers would prevent workers on the same work
site from receiving different wages, and reduce the incentive of firms to
prefer foreign subcontractors and foreign workers.</tt><p>
<tt>There are about 150,000 foreign workers from EU nations such as Greece,
Portugal, and the UK at work on German construction sites, and 140,000
unemployed German construction workers.  With non-EU and illegal alien workers,
the German building union estimates that there are as many as 500,000 foreign
construction workers in Germany.  The Portuguese, many of whom live on-site in
mobile homes, earn about DM 8-10 per hour.  The Poles earn about DM 4 per hour,
while the British workers earn an hourly  wage comparable to the Germans of DM
30 per hour.</tt><p>
<tt>Construction workers in Germany have since 1959 received bad-weather money
(Schlechtwettergeld) between November and March.  Beginning in 1996,
construction workers will be guaranteed 75 percent of their gross pay, plus DM
2 per hour ($1.33) for each hour that they cannot work due to bad weather in
the winter months.  The payments are financed one-third by workers--who agree
to give up five vacation days--and two-thirds by employers, with some
government subsidy.</tt><p>
<tt>In an attempt to limit the number of foreign workers, a new regulation went
into force in 1995 that allows only two foreign cooks per restaurant.  German
labor officials would like restaurant owners to hire from the pool of
unemployed cooks.  State authorities are allowed to make exceptions and grant
additional work visas, but an establishment must prove that it needs additional
foreign chefs.  Chef visas are valid for three years.</tt><p>
<tt>Some efforts to encourage German employers to hire German workers have been
unsuccessful.  In January 1995, the German government ruled that non-German
workers on German ships could receive the wages prevailing in their home
nations.  This meant that mostly Indonesian and Filipino sailors are paid far
less than German sailors. </tt><p>
<tt>In mid-October, Chancellor Kohl lamented the demise of the work ethic,
charging that too many Germans are taking prosperity for granted.  Kohl would
like to reduce labor market regulations that allegedly keep the unemployment
rate at 9.2 percent, or 3.5 million. </tt><p>
<tt>Wolfgang Schaueble, the head of the Christian Democrats in the Bundestag,
said that Germans must lower their expectations.  According to Schaueble, up to
one million foreign workers are employed temporarily in Germany, suggesting
that there are jobs for some of the unemployed Germans.</tt><p>
<tt>German employers and unions are increasingly negotiating "secret" side
deals to industrywide employer-union agreements that reduce wages, usually by
arguing that the future of the company is at stake.  Germany's IG Metall union,
the world's largest, has declined from a unification peak of 3.7 million
members to three million, as workers ask what the union can do for them.

<h3>
<a name="RTFToC18">Voting</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></h3>
<tt>About 54,000 non-German nationals of EU states voted in municipal elections
in Berlin on October 22.  They had to be 18 or over, a resident of Berlin for
at least three months, and not barred from voting in their own country.
</tt><p>
<tt>Turks, many of whom have lived in Germany for many years, are reportedly
frustrated because they were barred from voting.  The right to vote in local
elections is included in the Maastricht treaty, but each country is allowed to
determine residency requirements.  For instance, the Netherlands and Denmark
require longer periods of residency.  The Spanish allow three nationalities to
vote, based on reciprocal arrangements.  </tt><p>
<tt>A 20-year Turkish resident of Germany has begun the German Democratic
Party, whose purpose is to obtain voting rights for long-term resident
foreigners.  The lawyer-founder of the party may not lead it--a majority of the
party members and its leadership must be German citizens.  The Greens and the
Social Democrats have supported voting rights for foreigners.</tt><p>
<tt>There are 12,500 Russians registered as living in Berlin, but the true
number is believed to be 40,000 or more.  Most are concentrated in the
Charlottenburg area, where it is believed that "hot money" seeking safe
investments is pushing up real estate prices.</tt><p>
<tt>Each German Land has an aliens' commissioner, and at their annual
conference in late October, the commissioners called for more public services
and public sector jobs for foreigners.  They noted that foreigners are, on
average, 16 percent of the populations of large German cities, but foreigners
hold only seven percent of public sector jobs in these cities, mostly as
janitors.

<h3>
<a name="RTFToC19">Vietnamese
Repatriation</a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h3>
<tt>On November 14-17, Helmut Kohl, the first German chancellor to visit
Vietnam, began a 10-day, three-country tour of Asia to boost German investment
in the area.   One stumbling block to German investment in Vietnam has been the
disagreement between the two countries over the repatriation of Vietnamese in
Germany.  </tt><p>
<tt>In July 1995, Germany and Vietnam agreed to return 40,000 Vietnamese, who
had been imported by East Germany as guest workers, and came after unification
illegally, over five years--the first 2,500 were to be returned in this year.
On November 17, during his Vietnamese trip, Kohl announced that the quota would
not be fulfilled this year because the agreement did not go into effect until
September 1995 and that there are problems with implementing their mass
deportation.   </tt><p>
<tt>Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet set out new conditions for the
repatriation of Vietnamese living aboard.  The new conditions include
demonstrating that those returning do not have dual nationality, that they
lived in Vietnam, and that they were being sponsored by economic or social
organizations or individuals.  The new conditions are expected to further delay
the repatriation of Vietnamese from Germany.  </tt><p>
<tt>Germany must provide Vietnam with a list of who it plans to return, and
Vietnam must approve the list.  Some fear resistance and protests over what may
become forced deportations.</tt><p>
<tt>Germany agreed to provide up to $140 million to returning Vietnamese and
the Vietnam government.  There are believed to be 100,000 Vietnamese in
Germany, so that Germany will be left with a significant Vietnamese population
after the deportations.</tt><p>
<tt>After unification in 1990, Germany offered Vietnamese guest workers $2,000
and a ticket home, and an estimated 50,000 Vietnamese left.  Vietnam refused to
accept the Vietnamese who did not accept Germany's payment offer, and
Vietnamese who had been imported to work in other Eastern European countries
moved to Germany.  Germany granted these Vietnamese in the early 1990s two-year
residence permits if they had jobs and no criminal records.</tt><p>

<tt>Sweden is a country of six million that evolved from a country that
recruited guest workers (plus their families) and selected refugees for
resettlement to a country that, in the early 1990s, found that 90 percent of
its immigration was asylum-related.  </tt><p>
<tt>In 1992, over 84,000 foreigners--80 percent from the ex-Yugoslavia--
applied for asylum in Sweden, and Sweden, which was relatively generous in
providing some form of Temporary Protected Status as well as welfare benefits,
discovered that costs of asylum-related costs were SEK 20 billion ($2.7
billion).  </tt><p>
<tt>Sweden responded by changing its immigration laws and procedures.  In
mid-1995, a Swedish Parliamentary committee released a report that, inter alia,
recommends that Sweden tighten immigration by restricting family unification to
children 18 or less (versus the current 20) to reduce the number of relatives
who join each recognized asylum seeker from the current eight to six.  </tt><p>
<tt>The committee also recommended that refugee status no longer be granted to
draft evaders from other countries, and that TPS be granted for a maximum two
years.  </tt><p>
<tt>The Swedish government plans to reduce the number of residency permits
granted in 1996 to about 9,200.  Nearly 36,500 people received residence
permits in 1993, and about 18,640 refugees and asylum-seekers applied for them
in 1994.</tt><p>
<tt>Scandinavian countries have offered to finance the resettlement of refugees
from the former Yugoslavia, if they settle in Hungary.  Hungary says it cannot
accommodate a large number of refugees, but has 1,500 vacant places for
refugees, but no money to care for them.  The Hungarian government has not
officially responded to the offer.</tt><p>
<tt>Sweden often epitomizes the welfare state, the notion that full employment
and social service programs will maintain incomes and narrow economic
differences by the government.  However, structural changes are threatening the
viability of an extensive welfare state operated by governments.  </tt><p>
<tt>Immigration may have contributed to popular calls for scaling back the
welfare state.  Unemployment insurance benefits, which were 90 percent of usual
pay, are now 75 percent.  Unemployment, which is eight percent among Swedes, is
21 percent for foreign nationals.  Few immigrants receive work permits. </tt><p>
<tt>Racial violence has broken out in communities with refugees.  More than 100
incidents of ethnic violence have been reported this year. </tt><p>
<tt>The small town of Orbyhus, 80 miles north of Stockholm, has become a symbol
of the xenophobia threatening Sweden.  Fifteen refugee families from Bosnia and
Kosovo have been the target of violence and intimidation.  Nightly vigils by
skinheads are held outside their homes.  The Orbyhus chief of police places
blame on the local council for "dumping" 20 or 30 refugees in a small town.
Most are moving to other parts of the country.</tt><p>
<tt>In a November 3 report, the UN human rights committee praised Sweden for
its human right record, but  expressed concern about the growing racism and
xenophobia in Swedish society.  The committee urged the Swedish government to
take "appropriate measures," to counter the trend.  The committee also
complained about the prolonged detentions of illegal immigrants and foreigners
awaiting deportation.  </tt><p>
<tt>Sweden's reputation for humanitarianism suffered a severe blow when the
European Commission for Human Rights intervened in mid-October to stop the
deportation of a one-year old girl to Peru.  The girl's mother was scheduled to
be deported with her, even though she has been declared unfit to care for the
child, who has been in state care since her birth.  </tt><p>
<tt>The case is complicated by the fact that the father of the child, a
Peruvian opposition member now in Sweden, abused and killed their first child.
The mother was denied asylum, and the father is now jail for the murder of the
first child. </tt><p>
<tt>The case has been front-page news for several weeks because several
international organizations are concerned that Sweden is violating the UN
Children's Convention by not protecting welfare of refugee children.  The child
rights' organization, Save the Children, has said that the children of
asylum-seekers are by law denied the same health and dental care as Swedish
children.  A bill scheduled for consideration in the Swedish Parliament this
year would provide refugee children the same benefits as Swedish
children.</tt><p>

Top Priority in

</a></h2>
<tt>Riots in several French suburbs after police killed a Moroccan man November
1 fleeing their custody prompted Prime Minister Juppe to hold a summit meeting
on how to integrate especially immigrant youth in French suburbs and avoid
"US-style urban violence."  Funds to create an additional 100,000 jobs over
three years were promised.</tt><p>
<tt>A day after a cabinet reshuffle on November 7, France's Interior Minister
told the National Assembly that immigration was a top government priority.  The
government announced that it will not call for a suspension of immigration, but
will continue to impose strict limits on the number of immigrants allowed into
the country.  </tt><p>
<tt>The leader of the far right, Jean-Marie Le Pen, at a November 11 National
Front rally, told his supporters that he is not a racist; "we prefer the
French, but we don't hate foreigners." </tt><p>
<tt>Le Pen criticized several National Front mayors in early November for not
carrying out his policies regarding immigrants.  Le Pen had hoped that the
mayors of Orange, Toulon and Marignae would become showcases for his policy of
"national preference," giving priority to French nationals for housing, jobs
and welfare.  </tt><p>
<tt>The National Front mayors have not been able to practice "national
preference" because such policies are racially discriminatory and therefore
illegal in France.  After the meeting, Le Pen announced that the mayors would
not make grants to groups and associations that favored immigrants, and that
there would be more rigorous checks carried out on foreigners applying for
state benefits in these cities.  It was unclear what action, if any, the mayors
would take once they returned to their cities. </tt><p>
<tt>At the same time, it was revealed that Le Pen's daughter, a lawyer and
National Front member, was in court trying to keep an Algerian from being
deported.  Le Pen's daughter argued in court that the Algerian had lived in
France since he was one year old, and "felt in his heart that he was a
Frenchman and would feel like a foreigner in Algeria."  She defended her
handling of the case, saying that though the National Front is opposed to
France's immigration policies, it is not against individual rights. </tt><p>

<tt>A new study by the International Centre for Migration Policy Development
concludes that the cost of caring for refugees and asylum-seekers averaged
about $10,000 per person per year in the four Scandinavian countries.  Sweden
accounted for almost half of the $2.5 billion spent to care for the average
262,000 foreigners in these countries for the equivalent of 12 months in
1994.</tt><p>
<tt>The average costs of caring for asylum seekers in Scandinavian countries
were more than twice the $4,000-$4,500 average in Switzerland and Austria.
Sweden spent an average $10,000 per year to care for an average 64,000 asylum
seekers or persons granted humanitarian status or TPS, while Switzerland spent
an average $4,500 on an average 121,000 asylum seekers and refugees in its
system in 1994.</tt><p>
<tt>The costs of processing asylum seekers and refugees is typically less than
10 percent of the overall costs of the asylum-refugee system.  The major factor
in the cost estimates is the number of persons who depend on public assistance,
either because they do not or are not allowed to work.</tt><p>
<tt>Most of the asylum costs are associated not with the selection and
resettlement of refugees recognized under the Geneva convention of 1951, which
defined refugees as persons unable or unwilling to return to their countries of
citizenship because of a well-founded fear of political persecution.  </tt><p>
<tt>Instead, most of the costs are incurred to care for non-Geneva convention
foreigners who are granted Temporary Protected Status, or whose applications
for asylum are rejected, but not returned to their countries of citizenship.
For example, as of December 31, 1994, there were some 282,000 foreigners in
Germany whose applications for asylum had been rejected, but who had yet to be
deported, including Kurds who some German states refuse to deport.</tt><p>
<tt>In many European countries, the cost of operating the asylum and refugee
system has been stable or rising, even though the number of new applications
for asylum has been falling.  For example, the number of asylum applications in
Germany fell from over 400,000 in 1992 to less than 200,000 in 1994, but the
cost of operating the German asylum system rose to an estimated $10 billion in
1993.  Costs seem to have fallen to $8 billion in 1994.</tt><p>
<tt>The chief of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees said that the UNHCR is
challenged because of a worldwide decline in asylum rights.  Refugees now face
many closed borders because of an increased weariness about the large number of
asylum seekers seeking sanctuary. </tt><p>
<tt>Some experts say that the tougher anti-asylum legislation throughout Europe
has meant that asylum-seekers have had to depend upon professional smugglers
who often force them into crime and prostitution.</tt><p>

<tt>A referendum, Article 69, which would restrict the number of foreigners
allowed to live in Switzerland, gathered enough signatures to force a popular
vote.  The proposal would create a constitutional clause limiting non-Swiss
nationals to 18 percent of the population, down from the current level of 19
percent. </tt><p>
<tt>Under Swiss law, the government has until August 1997 to present its views
and compromise with the proposal's authors.  Another one or two years could
then pass before the referendum is actually held. </tt><p>
<tt>The proposal would cover foreign workers and their families, who currently
make up 18.8 percent of the seven million residents of Switzerland.  If asylum
seekers and those fleeing war are included in the figure, the proposed maximum
would be already exceeded, effectively ending immigration to Switzerland.
</tt><p>
<tt>Official figures show 62.5 percent of non-Swiss residents come from western
and southern Europe, and 21.9 percent from ex-Yugoslavia.</tt><p>
<tt>In October 22 elections, the anti-immigrant parties, anti-European
conservatives, and socialists made gains.  The Swiss People's Party (UDC) of
businessman Christopher Blocker ran a campaign based on a platform of
Eurosceptism and anti-immigration.  The UDC received about 30 seats. </tt><p>
<tt>Last year Swiss voters approved increasing police powers to crack down on
asylum-seekers and illegal foreigners.  In June, they rejected a government
proposal to make it easier for foreigners to buy property in Switzerland.
</tt><p>
<tt>Switzerland is not an EU member, but it is a member of the European
Economic Area, and the EU negotiating a seven part agreement that the Swiss
government hopes will put Switzerland back on the path to EU membership.  The
EU is demanding, and Switzerland is resisting, a proposal that EU citizens have
the right to look for work for up to three months in Switzerland and, if
offered a job, have the right to any necessary work and residence
permits.</tt><p>
<tt>The Swiss are reportedly resisting changes to their current policy, which
distributes a quota of work permits by sector and nationality each year on a
canton-by-canton basis.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC25">Labor
Exporters Plan for
Emigration</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>Indonesia plans to increase the number of Indonesians working abroad from
the current 1.2 million to two million by year 2000, when they are expected to
remit $12 billion annually.  Indonesia would like its migrants to earn at least
$500 per month, which implies that more skilled and professionals, and fewer
maids, will be sent abroad.  Indonesia has upgraded some of its vocational
schools to train workers for foreign labor markets.</tt><p>
<tt>Indonesia plans to post more labor attaches overseas to protect its migrant
workers.</tt><p>
<tt>Bangladesh officials worried in mid-October that increasing illegal
emigration to Saudi Arabia, Malaysia and South Korea may encourage these
nations to restrict the employment of Bangladeshis, and thus threaten the $1.5
billion Bangladesh earns annually in remittances-- Bangladesh earned $911
million in remittances during the first nine months of 1995.  Some 156,000
Bangladeshi workers were deployed abroad in the first 10 months of 1995.</tt><p>
<tt> Saudi Arabia is Bangladesh's largest foreign labor market, accounting for
nearly 720,000 of the 1.6 million Bangladeshis working abroad, and Saudi Arabia
has said that over 40,000 illegal Bangladeshis in the country should be
deported.</tt><p>
<tt>There are an estimated 70,000 illegal Bangladeshis in Malaysia, plus
161,000 with valid work permits, and South Korea recently ordered 5,500 illegal
Bangladeshis to leave or face deportation.</tt><p>
<tt>Government officials blamed Bangladeshi labor agents for collecting fees
and issuing forged documents to Bangladeshi workers eager for jobs
abroad.</tt><p>
<tt>The Philippines would also like to upgrade the skills of the migrant
workers that it sends abroad, both to increase remittances, and to prevent
exploitation.  There are about 25 million Filipinos employed in the
Philippines, and two to four million employed abroad. </tt><p>
<tt>There has been a continuing public outcry over the conditions that Filipina
maids sometimes experience abroad.  In July 1995, the Philippines announced
that women would not longer be allowed to emigrate legally to work as maids in
Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman and Qatar, and
that maids already employed there would have to return within five years.  The
Philippines also announced a phase-out on the migration of entertainers to
Cyprus, Greece and Japan.</tt><p>
<tt>The Philippines Overseas Employment Administration may have trouble
enforcing these bans on sending maids to certain countries.  The POEA admits,
for example, that Filipino nurses enter Jordan as $200 per month maids, but
then go to work as nurses.</tt><p>
<tt>The Philippines officially argues that exporting workers is a transitional
policy that will stop as per capita incomes rise.  However, most analysts note
that the Philippines has been unable to create manufacturing jobs for
ex-farmers--about 28 million Filipinos are considered to be poor, and
two-thirds of them live in rural areas--and new labor force entrants.  By some
estimates, one in three Filipino households has or had a member employed
abroad.  </tt><p>
<tt>In the meantime, the culture of emigration that is taking root in the
Philippines has led, some argue, to a rupturing the social fabric by breaking
down traditions of kinship and community.  The Philippine sense of self-worth
is believed to be eroding, as Filipina women abroad are viewed as either maids
or entertainers.  Some studies show that relatively few returned Filipino
workers are able to maintain the improved lifestyle that their remittances made
possible, encouraging some to attempt to re-emigrate.</tt><p>
<tt>In some villages, five to 10 percent of the population is abroad, that
practically everyone knows a migrant worker.  A 1989 census of Pozorrubio, for
example, found 3,500 overseas workers -- nearly all of them women--from a city
of 49,000.  Almost 60 per cent of the 258,984 Overseas Contract Workers OCWs
sent abroad in 1994 were female.  Some 153,000 Filipinos--of 300,000 on
available to go-- are employed on ships around the world, often at salaries of
about $300 per month.  The Philippines is the largest supplier of seafarers to
world shipping. </tt><p>
<tt>Many of the Filipino women going abroad to work as maids are college
graduates, with degrees in everything from chemical engineering to nursing, who
are escaping low wages and limited opportunities, and sometimes failing
marriages.  Stints abroad that were planned to last for one or two years have,
in some cases, turned into ten-year jobs.</tt><p>
<tt>A study by the Geneva-based International Organization for Migration (IOM)
of 170 Filipino domestic helpers in Hong Kong recommended that the Philippines
do a better job of encouraging the countries in which its nationals work to
enforce their labor laws. The Philippines both promotes labor exports and
attempts to protect its workers overseas, goals that sometimes conflict with
one another.</tt><p>
<tt>The report urged the government to form coalitions with other labor
exporters to remind labor importers of the benefits of migrant workers, and to
press collectively for better conditions, especially for maids.</tt><p>
<tt>The Philippines GDP is growing at a 5.5 percent rate, and this rate is
expected to climb to six percent or more in 1996 and 1997.  However, the
Philippines has very low domestic savings, and high domestic and foreign
debts.</tt><p>
<tt>The Philippines Department of Labor and Employment announced that it has
about 250 inspectors to police the nation's 400,000 workplaces.  Some 35,000 of
67,000 workplaces inspected in the first nine months were in violation of labor
laws, usually minimum wage, 13th month pay, and social security payment
obligations.</tt><p>
<tt>Vietnam's Department for Labor Management Abroad announced that it plans to
send 100,000 workers abroad annually to relieve unemployment pressures.  There
are currently about 15,000 Vietnamese contract workers abroad, and 20,000 are
expected to be deployed in 1995, mostly to in South Korea, Libya and the
Persian Gulf.</tt><p>
<tt>China has at least 270,000 contract workers employed abroad, 60 percent in
Asia, and some hope that overseas employment will be a safety valve as China
privatizes state-owned enterprises that once guaranteed lifetime employment.
According to Chinese officials, China will earn $7.5 billion from labor exports
in 1995, up from $5 billion in 1994--China includes the total value of
Chinese-supplied goods for e.g. construction projects abroad as well as wages
in these estimates.</tt><p>
<tt>There are currently 50 to 100 million internal migrants looking for jobs
within China, a number estimated to rise to 200 to 300 million by 2000.  China
recently began to promote the export of contract workers.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC26">Taiwan
To Import More Foreign
Workers</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a><a></a></a></h2>
<tt>Despite concerns about the social impacts of foreign workers, the Taiwan
government plans to allow 30,000 more foreign workers to fill manufacturing
jobs by the end of 1995.  It will be the largest additional increment of
foreign workers to be approved by the Council of Labour Affairs since Taiwan
permitted the legal entry of foreign workers in 1991.  </tt><p>
<tt>On November 23, 1995, the CLA announced that the number of foreign workers
to be admitted to the country would fluctuate with the unemployment rate.
Current regulations limit the number of foreign workers to 35 percent of the
number of Taiwanese workers in the labor insurance program.</tt><p>
<tt>According to a recent poll, 75 percent of Taiwan's small- and medium-sized
business owners cannot find enough workers.  However, Taiwan's unemployment
rate hit two percent in September, 1995, the second-highest rate in 10 years.
The Ministry of Economic Affairs reportedly favors the free entry of  foreign
workers, while the Council of Labor Affairs wants to preserve strict controls
over the number of foreign workers.</tt><p>
<tt>Nearly 4,000 illegal foreign workers were arrested between September 1 and
October 25 in a nationwide crackdown.  Most of the illegal workers are detained
in the Sanhsia detention center or in police holding cells until they are
repatriated.  The names of over 1,000 employers who illegally hired foreign
workers, and 49 agents accused of smuggling aliens into Taiwan, were turned
over to the district prosecutors.  There are an estimated 32,000 illegal
workers in Taiwan, including 11,000 who have abandoned jobs with the employers
who recruited them.</tt><p>
<tt>Taiwan is concerned about foreign workers using the pretext of entering the
country to study Chinese.  There are 5,000 to 6,000 foreigners studying Chinese
in Taiwan, and they are permitted to apply for work permits that allow up to 12
hours of work each week.  However, only 30 such permits have been issued;
leading to suspicions that many foreign students are working illegally. </tt><p>
<tt>Taiwan began to import foreign workers legally in October 1989, when
employers requested 65,000 foreign workers to work on high-priority national
infrastructure projects.  Labor costs had risen sharply as Taiwan's currency
appreciated in value.  The government permitted almost 44,000 foreign
construction workers to enter Taiwan.  In October 1991, an additional 10,000
foreign workers were approved.</tt><p>
<tt>The legal basis for importing foreign workers into Taiwan was established
in May 1992, and approvals of almost 13,000 maids, 175 health care providers,
2,000 fishing boat workers, and 27,000 foreign workers for other industries
followed in the next four months.  </tt><p>
<tt>The number of foreign workers, and the industries in which they are
permitted to work, has expanded steadily ever since--the CLA has granted
approval for some 270,000 foreign workers to work in Taiwan, and 193,100 are
currently in the country--131,000 from Thailand, 54,800 from the Philippines,
5,100 from Indonesia and 2,200 from Malaysia.  There are also about 8,000
foreign maids, mostly from the Philippines.  In mid-November, Taiwan began
radio broadcasts for Thai and Philippine workers to help ease social isolation.
The broadcasts include news and popular music in Thai, English and Tagalog.
</tt><p>
<tt>Taiwan limits the number of foreign workers admitted, so that the number of
employer requests for foreign workers is at least twice the number approved for
admission.  In November, 1995, several officials in Taiwan's Council of Labour
Affairs were accused of accepting bribes to approve employer requests for
foreign workers.</tt><p>
<tt>In order to obtain approval to employ foreign workers, employers must
advertise for local workers, prepare a plan to increase productivity, and offer
an orientation program for the foreign workers.  There are more than 100
agents--with names like Top International Manpower--that provide these services
to Taiwanese employers.</tt><p>
<tt>These agents typically have connections to a labor recruiter in the
Philippines or Thailand who recruit workers there, and they compete in Taiwan
to provide a package of services to Taiwan employers.  For example, a typical
agent's offering is to request a NT$25,000 (about US$1000) one-time fee to
cover recruitment costs, visa and other fees, and round-trip transportation to
Taiwan.  Employer's then pay the foreign workers Taiwan's minimum wage of
NT$14,880 per month, plus NT$2100 in government fees that are used to train
local workers, and NT$867 for workers' compensation coverage, or NT$17,847 per
month (about $700).</tt><p>
<tt>Foreign workers receive individual two-year contract; a TYPICAL CONTRACT (a
copy is available on the Migration News Home Page) includes a 40-day probation,
specifies an eight-hour, six-day work week, employer-provided housing and meals
at no charge, seven days paid leave after one year, and lists ten reasons for
terminating the contract, including getting married in Taiwan or acting against
the public order.</tt><p>
<tt>In early November, several CLA officials were charged with accepting bribes
of NT$ 3,000 for each foreign worker they approved from labor brokers.  Agents
also negotiate their fees; they can reduce or waive recruitment fees and travel
costs, for example, knowing that foreign workers can be induced to pay partner
agents in the Philippines  or Thailand for the privilege of working abroad.
The Chinese National Federation of Industries, the largest manufacturing
organization, says that the bribery cases reflect the outdated regulations of
the CLA.  The council blames the bribery scandal on a lack of manpower to
handle the applications for foreign workers. </tt><p>
<tt>A typical foreign worker in Taiwan will earn about $600 monthly at the
minimum wage, or $7,200 annually.  Many workers pay agents in their home
country 20 to 30 percent of their first year's wage to find them an overseas
job, or $1,800. </tt><p>
<tt>About 2.5 million Taiwanese work in manufacturing, about the same as in
1985.  Even high-tech firms in the Hsinchu industrial park are having trouble
recruiting workers--2,000 of the park's 36,000 workers are Filipinos.  There is
a limit of 30 percent on the number of foreign, blue-collar workers at each
company, a stricter limit than the 30 percent of a total company's work force
that can be foreign in other factories.</tt><p>
<tt>Labor migration in Taiwan and throughout Asia is distinguished by this
significant wedge between what an employer pays for foreign workers, and what
the worker receives.  </tt><p>
<tt>In the US, Mexican workers pay $300 to $500 to be smuggled into the US.  If
they work seasonally, earning $5 hourly for 1,000 hours, or $5,000, the cost of
getting to the job site is equivalent to 10 percent of their earnings.  But US
employers rarely pay for workers housing and meals; these costs can easily be
$50 per week, reducing a $200 weekly wage to $150, so that smuggling fees of,
say, $400, plus living costs of $50 per week for 25 weeks ($1475), can make the
costs of working illegally in the US equivalent to almost 40 percent of the
worker's earnings.  </tt><p>
<tt>Costs decline as wages rise and workers stay longer; a Mexican worker
employed full-time at $5 hourly earns $10,000, so that smuggling and living
costs of $500 plus 50 weeks times $50 make the cost of working in the US
equivalent to 30 percent of the worker's earnings. </tt><p>
<tt>Foreign workers in the US, and guest workers in Europe, used to keep more
of their earnings.  Under the US Bracero and European guest worker programs,
workers sometimes paid bribes to be selected to work abroad, but employers paid
transportation and other costs associated with getting to the job, as well as
living expenses.</tt><p>
<tt>Many foreign workers in Taiwan are employed in construction for over 190
hours each month.  According to a recent survey, the average monthly wage paid
in Taiwan's construction sector was NT$ 41,994 in April 1995, and the average
daily wage was NT$ 2,089.</tt><p>
<tt>Taiwan is a country of 21 million with a labor force in 1994 of 9.1
million.  About 12 percent of the labor force is employed in agriculture, but
75 percent of Taiwan's farmers and farm workers are expected to be displaced by
2005 because of Taiwan's 1996 World Trade Organization entry, which will force
the country to open itself to imported food. </tt><p>

<tt>There were 1.4 million foreign residents of Japan at the end of 1994, the
most ever recorded, and almost double the 800,000 in 1974.  As in the past,
almost 700,000 or half of the foreign residents in Japan were Koreans, followed
by about 200,000 Chinese and 150,000 Brazilians.</tt><p>
<tt>There were 106,000 foreigners with work permits in 1994, including 35,000
entertainers, 25,000 foreigners employed in humanities and international
relations, and 5,800 intra-company transfers.  The number of foreigners with
work permits exceeded 100,000 for the first time in 1994.</tt><p>
<tt>At the end of 1994, there were 61,500 foreign students in Japan, including
10,300 who arrived in 1994.  Of those arriving in 1994, about 26 percent were
from China, 22 percent from South Korea, and 12 percent from the US.  About
2400 foreign students who graduated from Japanese universities in 1994 were
hired by Japanese companies.</tt><p>
<tt>For the first time, Japan employed foreigners to help take the national
census.  About half of the one million foreigners living in Japan are Koreans,
and the cities of Tokyo and Osaka requested foreigners to help enumerate
residents in their cities.</tt><p>
<tt>Some 3,527 foreigners were deported in September and October 1995 for
violating Japanese immigration laws, including 812 Koreans, 538 Chinese, and
435 Thais.  Many foreigners caught working in Japan are sentenced to 18 months
in jail, but granted suspended sentences and deported-- under Japanese
immigration law, foreigners who have been sentenced to prison terms of over one
year are denied reentry.  According to one report, the number of illegal
foreigners in Japan dropped from 300,000 in May 1993 to 12,000 in May
1995.</tt><p>

<tt>The Cabinet Committee on Foreign Workers has completed its proposed law on
the recruitment and protection of foreign workers and it has been finalized by
the Attorney General.  The new guidelines are expected to permit local
employers to undertake direct recruitment of foreign workers in Thailand,
Bangladesh, Indonesia, the Philippines and Pakistan.  </tt><p>
<tt>The Malaysian government doubled the levy on foreign workers effective
January 1996.  The increase in levies--aimed at encouraging Malaysian employers
to reduce their dependence on foreign workers-- is expected to generate an
additional M$ 215 million--some M$300 million in levies was collected between
September 1992 and December 1993.  Employers must pay a monthly levy for all
foreign workers; the levy ranges from M$100 PTKs to M$200 senior management to
M$35 for an unskilled manufacturing and construction workers. The monthly levy
on foreign maids is M$30, and for agricultural workers, the levy ranges from
M$25 to M$60.</tt><p>
<tt>There were 553,658 registered foreign workers in the country in 1995, of
whom 252,877 were Indonesians, 82,796 Bangladeshis, 26,602 Filipinos, and
21,965 Thais.  However, the number of illegal workers is widely believed to
exceed the number of registered workers, bringing the total to over one
million.</tt><p>
<tt>In June 1995, there were about 81,000 foreign maids in Malaysia, 125,000
foreign farm workers, 123,000 foreign construction workers, 45,000 foreign
manufacturing workers, and 10,000 foreigners in other sectors.</tt><p>
<tt>The Malaysian Labor Minister warned employers in mid-October that they
would not be allowed to recruit foreign workers until after they had made
honest efforts to find local workers.  The minister urged employers to raise
wages, and to establish workplace nurseries, to attract Malaysian women
workers.</tt><p>
<tt>The Labor Minister said on September 24 that foreign workers are not
allowed to join unions because they are living in the country on the temporary
basis.  He also added that there are sufficient labor laws to protect them from
exploitation.  He added that if foreign workers were permitted to join unions
it might make local workers unhappy.</tt><p>
<tt>The Malaysian Electrical Industry Workers Union and the Malaysian Trade
Union Congress have said that the immigration department is breaking trade
union laws by not allowing foreign workers to join unions. </tt><p>
<tt>It has been reported that thousands of Bangladeshis are trying to register
themselves to work in Malaysia following a report that the Bangladesh
government will punish those who illegally look for work in Malaysia. </tt><p>
<tt>Indonesia, which has over 500,000 workers in Malaysia, has announced that
in the future it will only allow skilled workers in agriculture, industries,
construction, services and transport to work in Malaysia.  The two countries
have still not signed an agreement on the new procedures for the recruitment of
Indonesian workers in Malaysia.  The signing of an agreement has been delayed
due to an Indonesian demand that maids be paid a minimum wage of M$1,800.
</tt><p>
<tt>The Sabah state government announced that it is considering an amnesty for
the more than 500,000 illegal immigrants in Sabah.  Under the proposal, illegal
foreign workers would be offered work permits.</tt><p>
<tt>Malaysia is in the midst of a debate over whether the unskilled foreign
workers who increasingly staff its plantations, construction sites, factories,
and homes are an asset or liability.  On the one hand, it is clear that the
foreigners find jobs, earn incomes, and spend much of what they earn, both on
local goods, on transport, banking, and other services, and some of their
remittances are spent on imported Malaysian goods.</tt><p>
<tt>On the other hand, it is also clear that most of the foreign workers in
Malaysia are unskilled workers, and that Malaysia's goal of being an
industrialized country by 2020 may be threatened if the presence of many
unskilled workers keeps the country on a low-skill, low-tech trajectory.</tt><p>

<tt>The Singapore Parliament approved on November 1, 1995 an Employment of
Foreign Workers Act to deter the employment of illegal alien workers in
construction.  Under the act, employers who hire illegal workers will be fined
up to S$ 15,000 to S$30,000, and jailed up to 12 months.  Repeat offenders can
face double penalties.  These penalties can be extended to shipyards and
factories by the labor ministry.</tt><p>
<tt>If illegal workers are discovered at construction sites, the burden of
proof shifts to the primary employer to show that he did not know they were
present or illegal.  If more than five illegal workers are discovered, the
employer can be caned, or fined S$50,000 to S$100,000.  Primary employers at
work sites can escape the penalties if they can prove that they checked the
workers' papers, and restricted access to the site with e.g., fences, guards,
and IDs.</tt><p>
<tt>An average 31 employers each month of 1994 were found to be employing an
average 37 illegal alien workers.  Some 10,000 illegal workers were apprehended
in 1994, double the number caught in 1988.  Most of the illegal workers were
apprehended at construction sites; e.g., a late November raid found 178 illegal
foreign workers, including 143 with no documents.</tt><p>
<tt>The construction industry opposed the new law.  Construction
representatives point out that fencing is impractical at some sites, such as
road construction. </tt><p>
<tt>In November, two men were jailed for inducing the Work Permit and
Employment Department to issue a permit by falsely stating an foreign worker
applicant did not have Aids.  All foreign workers in Singapore must be
certified Aids-free.</tt><p>

<tt>On October 31, the Thai Labour and Social Welfare secretary called for a
clear<b> </b>policy on foreign workers.  The ministry currently does not have
the power to import unskilled labor, despite shortages. </tt><p>
<tt>In September 1994, Thailand's National Security Council estimated that
there were 525,000 illegal aliens in the country, two-thirds of whom are from
Burma.  By the end of 1994, the number of Burmese had increased at least 10
percent, bringing the total to 600,000.  </tt><p>
<tt>Most illegal immigrants in Thailand work in farming, fishing, construction,
and footwear and textile factories.  Most Thai employers pay migrants 30 to 50
percent less than Thai employees.  The Thai minimum wage is 145 baht
daily.</tt><p>
<tt>According to some estimates, there are between 30,000 and 50,000 Burmese
working in the southwest Thai province of Ranong.</tt><p>
<tt>In one province of Thailand, businesses hiring Burmese immigrants must
register their names with the local government and pay guarantee money of 5,000
baht ($200) for each worker.  The Thai employers had to register all foreign
workers by September 21, 1995.  The deadline was extended one month because
only one in four employers had deposited the guarantee money.  Some employers
have demanded that the Burmese immigrants pay the 5,000 baht guarantee
money.</tt><p>
<tt>Many of the Burmese working illegally in the northwestern city of Tak have
left because of the fear of being arrested.  As a result, several manufacturers
are considering moving out to an area where more labor and infrastructure is
more available. </tt><p>
<tt>According to some observers, the demand for unskilled immigrant workers
increased after 1993, when Thailand extended mandatory education from six to
nine years (about age 15), with nationwide enforcement scheduled by 1997.
About 15 percent of the 1.5 million workers employed in the textile industry
are expected to disappear because they are in school.  Some textile factories
are automating, and others are moving to border provinces, where illegal
workers are more available.</tt><p>
<tt>Bangkok has become one of the major transit points for foreigners trying to
illegally enter the US.  US government officials in Thailand estimated that
2,000 people per month try to leave Thailand for the US.  Most use false papers
or lie to get Thai passports and US visas, some travel without papers.  The US
government says that only 20 percent of the 2,000 are Thais, the rest are
Chinese, Indians, Bangladeshis and others using Thailand as a starting point to
the West.</tt><p>
<tt>Thai police in November 1995 arrested in Bangkok a native of Taiwan who is
believed to have arranged for the smuggling of 300 Chinese aliens on the Golden
Venture, the ship that ran aground in New York in 1993.  As the case unfolds,
it appears that "investors" collected $30,000 each from migrants and their
families in Fujian province, and hired the Taiwanese man arrested as a contract
smuggler.</tt><p>

<tt>Britain will accept Chinese demands to stop granting Hong Kong permanent
residency to returning migrants after July 1, 1997.  This is in major change in
Britain's previous position, that Hong Kong emigrants should be unconditionally
offered permanent residency if they return after 1997.  London hopes that by
making this concession, it can secure China's consent on other arrangements
contained in a residency package aimed at enabling the return of
emigrants.</tt><p>
<tt>There are about 300,000 foreign workers in Hong Kong, and the unemployment
rate is expected to remain at 3.5 percent in 1995, the highest rate in 13
years.  The government announced plans to reduce the number of foreign workers
admitted.</tt><p>
<tt>There are about 300,000 foreign workers in Hong Kong.</tt><p>
<tt>In an unprecedented migration, the remains of thousands of Hong Kong dead
are being dug up and shipped to California.  Hong Kong's Chinese worry that
when the mainland Chinese take over in 1997 they will build over the
territory's cemeteries.  Ironically, San Francisco's Chinese community used to
send their dead back to China.   </tt><p>
<tt>Hong Kong is racing to finish its new airport by June 30, 1997, when China
takes over Hong Kong's government.  In October 1995, about 20 percent of the
18,200 airport construction workers were foreigners.  Minimum wages are $1,280
per month, but many workers complain that contractors and subcontractors take
some of their salaries in illegal charges.</tt><p>

<tt>Saudi Arabia's five-year plan for 1995-2000 aims to eliminate foreign
workers in the public sector, including civil aviation, social security and
social insurance.  Foreigners are currently about 70 percent of the labor
force. </tt><p>
<tt>Most of the 500,000 Saudis expected to find jobs in the next five years are
expected to be employed by private employers.  However, Saudis reportedly
prefer public sector jobs, where pay and benefits are better.  Saudi employers
reportedly prefer foreigners because they have higher productivity, high skills
and experience, and the cost of recruiting them is lower.</tt><p>
<tt>In 1985, Saudi Arabia announced plans to substitute 600,000 Saudis for
local workers, but, by 1990, there were 275,000 more foreigners were
employed.</tt><p>
<tt>The Bahraini government is studying a plan to allow foreign workers who
have left the country to return after one year to work for another employer
without requiring a no objection certificate from the previous employer.  The
plan would also facilitate the identification of foreigners who have overstayed
their residency permits.  The new regulations are expected to take effect
before the end of the year.</tt><p>
<tt>A three-and-a-half-month amnesty program in Bahrain resulted in 9,250
foreign workers legalizing their residency in the country.  Under the amnesty,
people who have stayed in Bahrain illegally after their residence permits have
expired were granted exemption from fines.  The sponsors of illegal immigrants
who did not regularize their stay will be fined.  Some employers would give
foreigners their passports so that they could legalize their residency. </tt><p>
<tt>A member of the Kuwaiti parliament said the country should make it easier
for foreign workers to bring in their families to boost the economy and help
stabilize the country's male-dominated expatriate community.  Nearly one
million of Kuwait's 1.8 million population are foreign guest workers, most of
them men from Egypt and Asia.  Most do not bring in family or keep their
financial assets in the country because of the strict residency rules
introduced after the 1991 Gulf War to reduce the country's reliance on foreign
workers. </tt><p>
<tt>Kuwaiti merchants complain that this policy has significantly reduce the
amount the foreign workers spend in Kuwait. </tt><p>
<tt>Earlier this year the government abandoned a minimum salary rule and
decided to charge foreigners $200 for every dependent they brought into the
country.  An August law passed by Parliament abolished all new fees imposed in
1995 for state services so in late September the government halted the
collection of the flat fee and reinstated the minimum salary.  The new rule
requires that foreigners in the private sector who want to bring in their
families mush earn a minimum of $2,155 a month and those in the public sector
must earn a minimum of $1,500.  Most foreigner workers earn less than
that.</tt><p>

<tt>Environmental changes such as land degradation are, according to one UN
agency prediction, expected to displace over 135 million rural people from the
land, making them "environmental refugees."  A November 14, 1995 meeting in San
Francisco reviewed the extent to which land degradation is contributing to
legal and illegal Mexico to US migration.</tt><p>
<tt>There is no doubt that many of Mexico's agricultural resources such as land
and water have deteriorated over the past two decades, but it is very hard to
distinguish between the effects of such long-run trends and the results of
short-run variables that encourage migration.  </tt><p>
<tt>For example, rural Mexicans are reducing their dependence on farming
non-irrigated lands.  Some households reduce their dependence on farming by
earning other income.  Nonfarm income can be generated by having one or more
household members migrate seasonally to the US, or within Mexico, or having the
entire household leave the rural area where it is established.</tt><p>
<tt>Most economists believe that individuals and households change their
behavior in response to price changes.  If land degradation makes the land less
productive, and if agricultural policy reform, plus trade agreements that
promise different prices, change the outlook for particular crops, then land
and crop prices will change, and rural households will respond, in part by
migrating.</tt><p>
<tt>Mexico made changes in the 1990s that altered prices in rural Mexico in a
manner that signaled rural Mexicans to get out of agriculture.  Mexico freed up
the land market, reduced agricultural subsidies, and signed NAFTA--steps that
will probably cause the price of crop land used to grow field crops, such as
corn in non-irrigated areas, to fall, and the value of irrigated land used to
produce avocados or vegetables to rise.</tt><p>
<tt>In areas where land prices fall, some people will respond by selling or
abandoning land and migrating to urban areas in Mexico or to the US.  There are
several ways to counter such migration--raise prices in order to keep people on
the land, or make investments to reverse land degradation.  In today's Mexico,
it would appear easier to raise prices than to obtain the funds needed for
improving land quality.</tt><p>

displaced from their homes.  Some 14.4 million persons are considered refugees,
down from 18.2 million in 1993, which means that they are outside their country
of citizenship, and unable to return for fear of political persecution.
Another 36 million persons have been displaced from their homes, but remain
inside their country--they are not considered refugees.</tt><p>
<tt>A UNHCR report released on November 23 criticized European countries
detaining asylum-seekers.  The report said countries were holding asylum

airport transit zones while the awaiting a decision on their claim for
asylum.</tt><p>
<tt>The report recognized that some migrants were using the asylum process to
seek economic or other opportunities in Europe, but asked countries to make a

Guest
Workers</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a><a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></h2>
<tt>On December 7 and 14, the House Immigration Subcommittee on Immigration and
Claims held hearings on agricultural guest workers.</tt><p>
<tt>The December 7 hearing was the first one devoted entirely to guest workers
in the 1995 round of immigration reform.  Growers testified that they support
efforts to reduce illegal immigration, but<b> </b>that they also want a
"viable, legal work force."  </tt><p>
<tt>The only way to guarantee such a work force, they argued, is with a new
standby guest worker program that would permit farmers to employ foreign
workers after attesting that they had attempted to hire domestic workers.
After filing such an attestation with the US Department of Labor, a farmer
would be allowed to recruit, have admitted into the US, and employ foreigners
unless complaints led the US government to revoke his right to do so.</tt><p>
<tt>Most observers do not believe that US farmers need a streamlined guest
worker program, because, by measures that range from wages to unemployment
rates, there are surpluses rather than shortages of farm workers.  Many growers
acknowledge the current labor surplus, but they assert that, with new efforts
to control illegal immigration, they will no longer be able to employ
unauthorized workers who present them with false documents.</tt><p>
<tt>The effect of proposed new immigration enforcement measures on the farm
labor supply depends on two unknowns:<b> </b>first, on how many people now in
the farm work force are unauthorized immigrants, and second, on how effective
the new measures will be.  Farmers assert that the share of unauthorized
workers is high--in excess of 50 percent of the farm work force--and that the
new measures to control illegal immigration will be both effective and
quickly-felt.  </tt><p>
<tt>Opponents say that the illegal-immigrant share is lower (the US Department
of Labor estimate is 25 percent), and that any impacts of immigration
enforcement on farm labor supplies will be gradual and incremental, not sudden
and dramatic.  Furthermore, they say that growers could adjust to fewer
unauthorized workers by recruiting US workers and temporary foreign workers
through the H-2A program, or reducing their demand for labor through
mechanization or better management of farm labor.</tt><p>
<tt>Both President Clinton and the US Commission on Immigration Reform (CIR)
oppose a new agricultural guest worker program, arguing that a new guest worker
program would increase illegal immigration and reduce employment, wages, and
work standards for American workers.  President Clinton stated in June that if
a crackdown on illegal immigration, which he favors,<b> </b>should create labor
shortages for perishable crops, he will instruct the Departments of Labor and
Agriculture to work together to improve existing programs to meet agriculture's
needs.  </tt><p>
<tt>At the December 7 hearing, representatives skeptical about a new foreign
farm labor program, including Subcommittee Chair Lamar Smith(R-TX), agreed with
the majority of economists and immigration specialists, who say that if 20 to
40 percent of the current farm work force is unauthorized, farm employers will
be able to adjust gradually to the loss of unauthorized workers by employing US
workers and getting legal foreign workers through the H-2A program.</tt><p>
<tt>Academic researchers and representatives of farm worker organizations
pointed to the current farm-labor surplus in the United States, falling real
wages, benefits, and working conditions for farm workers, and high levels of
unemployment and underemployment.  A new guest worker program, they<b>
</b>contended, is neither justified nor workable in such a surplus-labor
environment.</tt><p>
<tt>The most outspoken opponent of a new agricultural guest worker program
present at the December 7 hearing was Howard Berman (D-CA).</tt><p>
<tt>On December 14, the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration and Claims
and the Agriculture Subcommittee on Risk Management and Specialty Crops held a
joint hearing on guest workers.  USDA testified that the Clinton administration
is opposed to the establishment of a new guest worker program; the existing
H-2A program is a "sufficient means to provide relief to farm employers from
serious labor shortages as well as to improve the wages and working conditions
of US agricultural workers."</tt><p>
<tt>Growers argued that the H-2A program<b> </b>fails to meet their needs and
cannot be made to work.  They urged approval of the simpler attestation
procedure for obtaining temporary foreign farm workers.  </tt><p>
<tt>Although the growers program has not yet been released in detail, growers
assert that, under it, they would attest that they had tried recruit US workers
and promise that if they consequently employed temporary foreign workers, they
would pay them at least the<b> </b>prevailing wage rate; provide housing or a
housing allowance when it is the prevailing practice; confine the guest workers
to jobs that last less than 10 months; notify existing farm workers they have
filed attestations; give preference to qualified US workers in hiring; and
avoid using guest workers when there is a strike or lockout.  </tt><p>
<tt>Growers would pay for the cost of administering the program with
contributions to a trust fund equivalent to the payroll taxes that would not be
paid on the guest workers' wages.</tt><p>
<tt>Some growers argued for a better employee verification system.  One Florida
farmer was reportedly fined $150,000 for hiring illegal alien workers, and then
fined again - $120,000 - for firing 40 workers whose documents did not appear
to be in order.</tt><p>
<tt>Growers are gaining allies.  An<b> </b>op-ed article in the Wall Street
Journal on November 9 advocated a guest worker program for agriculture.  Its
author, Rael Jean Isaac, argued that the Bracero program "worked," and, for
this reason, the current H-2A program through which temporary alien farm
workers are admitted for US farm work should be revamped to resemble the 1950s
Bracero program.</tt><p>
<tt>The Isaac article and a summary of grower testimony to the Senate
Immigration Subcommittee on September 28 (MN, October, 1995), prompted many
responses in the Wall Street Journal.  For example, it was noted that, when all
the costs are counted, there may be nothing more expensive than cheap farm
workers.  In Santa Barbara county, strawberry acreage increased almost four
times between 1986 and 1993, and the resulting farm worker poverty helped a
local employment training agency to win a $500,000 training grant by arguing
that the number of poor farm workers in the area had increased.</tt><p>
<tt>Isaac and other writers often<b> </b>overlook<b> </b>significant details of
the Bracero program.  First, there was not one program, but several programs,
some administered by the USDA, some by DOL.  For a few years, farmers could
recruit workers in any manner they chose, as in the H-2A program.  Second,
there was always opposition to the Bracero program--the President's Commission
on Migratory Labor in 1951 recommended against a Bracero program.  Congress
overrode this recommendation, but included several of the protective features
that the Commission recommended.</tt><p>
<tt>Farmers not wishing to follow Bracero program guidelines encouraged illegal
immigration and employment in the early 1950s.  They were shielded by the
"Texas proviso" of the 1952 INA, under which the only punishment for employment
of illegal aliens, even when it was deliberate, was the removal of the aliens
from the employer's premises.  Farmer resistance to PL-78 Bracero program
guidelines in the early 1950s, plus the dependence of hundreds of thousands of
Mexican workers on US jobs, are what produced the "wetback crisis" of 1954.
</tt><p>
<tt>Third, the undoing of the Bracero program began in the late 1950s, when the
Secretary of Labor in a Republican administration decided to<b> </b>enforce the
rules under which Mexicans worked in the US  Farmers complained bitterly, but
when it became clear that, starting in 1961, Democrats would enforce the rules
even more vigorously, research aimed at saving labor grew enormously.  The
University of California alone was engaged in over 300 labor-saving
mechanization research projects in the early 1960s, including the successful
effort to mechanize the processing tomato harvest.</tt><p>
<tt>A guest worker program can always convert illegal into legal workers, as
was done in the mid-1950s.  But the Bracero program proves that admitting
hundreds of thousands of unskilled workers for as little as six weeks can have
unforeseen and undesired consequences.</tt><p>
<tt>In early November, several of the House Republicans spearheading
immigration reform efforts toured California fields to hear growers' proposals
for a guest worker program.  Immigration subcommittee chair Smith was quoted as
saying that he hopes his immigration reform bill will not have "an adverse
effect on the labor supply," which some growers interpreted as support for a
guest worker program, since they maintain that 30 to 50 percent of their
current work force are illegal aliens.</tt><p>
<tt>The grower strategy is to exaggerate the share of unauthorized workers in
the farm work force, agree with Congress that new controls will quickly reduce
illegal immigration, establish that the H-2A program is not a sufficient safety
valve, and thus justify a new guest worker program now, while Congress is
dealing with immigration reform, rather than in the future, when there may be
farm labor shortages.</tt><p>
<tt>The purpose of guest or non-immigrant worker programs is to add workers to
the labor force without adding permanent residents to the population.  Critics
point out that, from Japan to Germany,<b> </b>guest worker programs have failed
to do that<b>, </b>inspiring the adage that there is nothing so permanent as a
temporary workers<b>.</b></tt><p>
<tt><b></b>Over time, employers, investors, and local workers begin to make
decisions that assume that foreign workers will continue to be available, so
that the familiar argument, "we will go out of business without foreign
workers," becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.</tt><p>
<tt>Professor Mark Miller of the University of Delaware noted that France's
seasonal worker program admits primarily alien farm workers, but it shrank from
200,000 in 1974 to 11,300 in 1994, when mostly Moroccans and Poles were
admitted.</tt><p>
<tt>Many of the illegal alien farm workers who became legal residents in the
1987-88 Special Agricultural Worker program got green cards in December 1990,
are now eligible to apply for US citizenship.  About 52 percent of the 1.3
million SAW applications were filed in California, and 82 percent of all
applicants were from Mexico.  The INS received one million applications for
naturalization in 1995.</tt><p>
<tt>The effects of a wave of farm worker naturalizations are the subjects of
debate.  The INS and most farm worker advocates encourage naturalization as a
means of promoting inclusion-- giving all residents full rights.  However, some
immigration control groups, as well as some local officials, assert that
naturalization will increase family unification and welfare
costs.<b></b></tt><p>

<tt>In early December, the INS tested a plan near Nogales, Arizona for
processing and returning to Mexico<b>,</b> or detaining<b>,</b> a hypothetical
mass of illegal migrant Mexicans--the third such INS test of a mass migration
emergency in 1995.  The INS noted that no such mass migration is expected, but
that the Haitian and Cuban migration emergencies in 1994 demonstrated the need
to plan for such contingencies.</tt><p>
<tt>A Mexican official said that the exercises was not appropriate, and that
the cyclical flow of migrants into the US for employment is now a structural
feature of the North American labor market.</tt><p>
<tt>In late December, the US announced that a ring headed by a woman in Costa
Rica had been broken up after smuggling 10,000 aliens annually into the US.
According to an interagency working group on the smuggling of illegal aliens to
the United States, "some 100,000 aliens from outside the region" pass through
one or more Central American countries annually on their way to the United
States.</tt><p>
<tt>The money to be earned from alien smuggling is reportedly fueling
corruption.  In 1995, immigration officials in Panama, Belize and Guatemala
were fired for accepting bribes from alien smugglers.  Honduras is the only
Central American country in which smuggling of humans is a crime.</tt><p>
<tt>The interagency report estimated that 500,000 illegal aliens enter Western
Europe each year, many transiting through Moscow, where an estimated 200,000
illegal aliens may be in temporary residence at any time, including 60,000
Chinese and 40,000 South Asians.  The report criticizes Taiwan for
"unsatisfactory" cooperation against alien smugglers despite repeated US
requests for action.</tt><p>
<tt>The Department of Justice's Inspector General issued a report on December
1, 1995 that criticized INS for negotiating low fines and easy settlements with
employers discovered to have hired illegal aliens.  About 10,000 US employers
faced fines of about $70 million between FY90 and FY94; these fines were
settled for $29 million, or less than half the initial levy.  Most of the fines
were for paperwork violations, not for hiring illegal alien workers.</tt><p>
<tt>Some 2,200 California employers were initially charged $14 million.  The
largest potential fine was against the Walt Disney company, which faced
$400,000 in fines for improper paper work on 1,200 new hires.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS announced that, after March 20, 1996, I-151 green cards issued
before 1970 will not longer be valid.  The INS is attempting to reduce fraud by
issuing new and harder to counterfeit cards to permanent resident aliens who
have the right to live and work practically anywhere in the US.  The new card
will require a photograph, fingerprint and signature.  The new card costs $75,
but the INS will waive the fee for those who cannot afford it.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS and other agencies that screen arriving US citizens and aliens
announced steps aimed at speeding up the process beginning in March 1996.  In
FY94, some 444 million persons entered the US over the northern and southern
borders, and 57 million international passengers arrived at US airports.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS is one of the fastest-growing federal agencies--it has 21,800
full-time employees, including almost 5,000 Border Patrol agents.  Its FY96
budget is expected to be $1.7 billion, and with fee income, $2.6
billion--budget language instructs INS to add 1,000 more Border Patrol agents
on the US-Mexican border.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS announced that the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements
Program (SAVE) won an innovative technology award.  SAVE includes data on 50
million non-US citizens, and federal and state service providers, from the Food
Stamp program to AFDC to federal housing assistance to the California
Department of Motor Vehicles, use the system to verify the immigrant status of
alien applicants for benefits and services.  </tt><p>
<tt>SAVE was implemented in 1989, and through June 1995 had dealt with over 21
million inquires--about 149,000 persons were denied benefits, about seven
tenths of one percent.  The SAVE system has recently been expanded to verify
the status of newly hired private sector workers in southern California.</tt><p>
<tt>In FY95, the INS apprehended 524,234 illegal immigrants in the San Diego
sector.  Some 1,200 criminals trying to re-enter the country have been
prosecuted so far this year, and 3,000 people arrested with counterfeit
immigration documents were detained for 72 hours, taken before an immigration
judge and deported.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS announced on December 28, 1995 that it had removed a record 51,600
criminal aliens from the US in 1995, two-thirds of whom were criminal aliens
who were deported after serving prison terms in the US.  The INS also prevented
9,400 aliens from entering the US in 1995, up from 5,700 in 1994.  </tt><p>
<tt>California Governor Pete Wilson asked the federal government to take
symbolic custody of one of California's 16,000 criminal aliens to show that the
federal government is responsible for criminal aliens.  California's 1993
lawsuit for federal reimbursement of costs associated with illegal immigrants
is still pending--California estimates that it costs $21,000 per year to
accommodate prisoners. </tt><p>
<tt>Some 147 of the 282 Chinese aliens aboard the Golden Venture, the smuggling
ship that ran aground in New York in June 1993, remain in US jails.  Some have
begun hunger strikes.  The crew that smuggled them to the US received jail
terms of one to 4.5 years.</tt><p>
<tt>The New Jersey Senate in October approved legislation that would require
employers with state contracts to certify that all of their employees are
entitled to work in the US.  A second measure would make undocumented workers
ineligible for worker's compensation and temporary disability payments for
workplace injuries.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC4">Congress</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
Debates Jus Soli</a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>On December 13, 1995, two Congressional subcommittees held a hearing on
proposals to deny US citizenship to the children of illegal aliens born in the
US.  House Immigration Chair Lamar Smith (R-TX) invited eight House members and
former Congresswoman Barbara Jordan to testify for and against the possibility
of constitutional amendments or changes in federal immigration law to curtail
the benefits of citizenship to illegal immigrants. </tt><p>
<tt>The US Constitution contained no definition of citizenship until the
adoption of the 14th Amendment in 1868.  It states: "All persons born or
naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are
citizens of the United States and the state wherein they reside." </tt><p>
<tt>The 14th Amendment has been interpreted to mean that all persons born in
the US--except children born to parents not subject to the jurisdiction of the
US because they are diplomats or representatives of international
organizations-- are automatically US citizens<b>.</b>  In 1898, the US Supreme
Court ruled that a child born in San Francisco to Chinese parents who could not
become citizens themselves was automatically a US citizen.</tt><p>
<tt>According to Rep. Lamar Smith(R-TX),<b> </b>"The original intent and
purpose of the 14th Amendment was not to grant birthright citizenship."
</tt><p>
<tt>Rep. Brian Bilbray, (R-CA) sponsored H.R. 1363, the "Citizenship Reform Act
of 1995, which "would deny automatic citizenship at birth to children born in
the United States to parents who are not citizens or permanent resident
aliens."</tt><p>
<tt>According to Bilbray, the bill would reinterpret the Constitution, an
approach that would be faster than a Constitutional amendment.  The Justice
Department has said that such a change<b> </b>would not be in keeping with US
constitutional history and tradition.  If the bill were enacted, no discretion
could be exercised by public officials on the questions, the department
maintains.  Another bill, introduced by Sonny Callahan (R-AL) would also deny
citizenship to the children of legal immigrants.</tt><p>
<tt>The emotional hearing featured testimony of opponents, such as Rep. Jose E.
Serranno (D-NY), who said that the bills were "a reaction to little brown
babies that simply aren't welcome here."  The hearing was dominated by
Californians who are concerned about he impact illegal immigration has on the
state.  In 1992, undocumented immigrants gave birth to 92,000 babies in
California under the Medi-Cal program, making such births 40 percent of the
237,000 publicly funded births in the state.</tt><p>
<tt>Proponents of change say that such a situation was not imaginable in 1868;
opponents say changing the 14th amendment affects core American values--
birthright citizenship. </tt><p>
<tt>Bilbray argued that it is unfair to offer generous health and welfare
benefits to the children of illegal immigrants: "The gift of citizenship is the
greatest gift we can bestow. To give it to those who break the law is an insult
to every legal immigrant." </tt><p>
<tt>Commission on Immigration Reform Chair Barbara Jordan countered that: "To
deny birthright citizenship is to derail the engine of American liberty."
</tt><p>
<tt>In a study of 38 countries, the Center for  Immigration Studies found that
13 --including Mexico, Canada, Brazil and Spain-- grant citizenship based on
place of birth.  Twenty-five require also that at least one parent be a citizen
or of that country's<b> </b>ethnicity, and six of the twenty-five specify
whether it is to be the mother or the father who provides the link.</tt><p>

187</a>
Judges Urges Speedy Appeal</a></h2>
<tt>In November, 1995, a federal judge, in a 72-page 
<a href=Prop_187_Opinion.html>OPINION </a> (League of United
Latin American Citizens v. Wilson, Case No. CV 94-7569 MRP--available on the
Migration News Home Page), declared most parts of Prop. 187 unconstitutional, a
decision that the state of California vowed to appeal--one official called the
judge's decision the first round in a ten-round fight.  </tt><p>
<tt>The US Supreme Court has ruled that the "power to regulate immigration is
unquestionably exclusively a federal power," and the judge held that
"Proposition 187's verification, notification and cooperation/reporting
requirements directly regulate immigration by creating a comprehensive scheme
to detect and report the presence and effect the removal of illegal
aliens."</tt><p>
<tt>After her ruling, the judge said that she wants a quick appeal, but gave
state lawyers until the end of January to decide if they want to push ahead
with a section cutting health benefits to illegal immigrants.  She also said
that she supports a permanent injunction of Prop. 187 to speed the final
resolution of<b> </b>the legal issues. </tt><p>
<tt>The key distinction in most of the ruling is the source of funds.  If an
assistance program is funded with both federal and state funds, the judge ruled
that California could not unilaterally make illegal aliens ineligible for
benefits.  But if the program is funded with state funds<b> </b>only, then
California can make illegal aliens ineligible for benefits.  </tt><p>
<tt>Only in K-12 education is the source of funds irrelevant--in this case, a
1982 US Supreme Court decision requires states to educate illegal alien
children.  The judge ruled, however, that under federal law California can deny
entry and in-state tuition status to illegal aliens seeking entry to colleges
and universities.   A California state judge has so far prevented this policy
from taking effect.</tt><p>
<tt>Attorneys representing California argued<b> </b>that the state has a right
and duty to conserve scarce state funds, and to spend them as voters wish.  The
federal judge, by contrast, emphasized that only the federal government has the
power to regulate immigration.</tt><p>
<tt>Some commentators noted that the judge's decision may prompt Congress to
enact a Prop.-187 measure, since Congress--but not the states-- has the
constitutional right to make aliens ineligible for benefits.  Since 1964,
judges have invalidated six of the 36 initiatives approved by California
voters.  The 1978 Proposition 13, which limited property taxes, survived legal
challenge</tt><p>

Works on Dual Nationality</a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>Mexico in 1996 is expected to approve a dual nationality amendment to the
Mexican Constitution that would permit Mexican nationals who become citizens of
another country to retain the right to own land in coastal areas and to retain
their shares of ejido or communal lands.  Mexicans opting for US or other
citizenship would lose their right to vote in Mexican elections, but could
retain their Mexican passports.</tt><p>
<tt>President Zedillo made dual citizenship a key plank in his foreign policy,
and on several occasions reminded the estimated two to three million
Mexican-born nationals in the US who are eligible to apply for US citizenship
that they are Mexicans who happen to live north of the border.  Some US
observers fear that Mexico is "interfering" in US politics by urging its
nationals living in the US to become US citizens, and then support Mexican
government positions in the US.  Mexico has 51 consulates throughout the US,
while the US has 16 consulates in Mexico.</tt><p>
<tt>Over 8,000 Mexicans applied for asylum in the US in 1994 and 1995, and
about 60 were granted asylum, most in 1995.  In FY94, Haitians were most likely
to receive asylum in the US (1,060 Haitians were granted asylum) and in FY95,
946 Indians were granted asylum.</tt><p>
<tt>On December 18, 1995, NAFTA was to permit trucks that satisfy national
standards to cross the border and to deliver goods within border states with
foreign drivers, not just the current 20-mile commercial limit.  After pressure
from the Teamsters Union, the US Department of Transportation announced that
there would be a delay in free access, pending the outcome of discussions with
Mexico about highway safety.</tt><p>
<tt>Although US truckers can carry goods into Mexico, few US companies permit
their drivers to take goods into Mexico because of fears of theft, so the major
beneficiary of this NAFTA provision would have been Mexican truckers. </tt><p>
<tt>The US Teamsters union and border state politicians pressured the Clinton
Administration not to permit Mexican trucks to move beyond the 20-mile zone.
According to those favoring a delay in free Mexican truck movement, 1,200 of
the 5,000 Mexican trucks entering Texas every day are time bombs because they
carry fuel or explosives in unsafe trucks--in many cases, Mexican trucks meet
Mexican safety standards, but not US safety standards.</tt><p>
<tt>Instead of making cross border truck traffic easier, on December 19, there
were stepped up US safety checks of Mexican trucks entering the US.  Some
Mexican drivers, who reportedly earn $62 per week, complained of
discrimination.  The trucking delay illustrates the problems involved in
integrating two very different economies.</tt><p>
<tt>Along most of the US-Mexican border, the Mexican city is more populous than
its US counterpart.  Juarez, a city of 1.5 million residents across the Rio
Grande from El Paso, a city of 600,000, has about 25 percent of Mexico's
maquiladora employment--some 150,000 Mexicans work in 310 maquiladoras.  Juarez
had a city budget of $37 million in 1994, and the mayor notes that, with this
small budget, Juarez is unable to build the infrastructure needed in this
fast-growing city.  The minimum wage in Juarez was raised to $20 per week on
December 4, 1995.  Border residents complain that the Mexican government has
begun to collect import taxes from Mexican shoppers who return from the United
States with more than $400 in consumer goods.</tt><p>
<tt>In 1995, total compensation--wages plus benefits--paid to maquiladora
workers is expected to average $1.80 an hour, down from $2.61 in 1994.  The
NAFTA labor commission ruled in a case involving a Sony TV assembly plant in
Matamoros that the Mexican government failed to enforce the right of workers to
freely organize.</tt><p>
<tt>In the US, by comparison, the total compensation paid to private sector
workers averaged $17.10 an hour in March 1995, with straight-time wages and
salaries averaging $ 12.25 an hour and benefit costs averaging $ 4.85, making
benefit costs 29 percent of total compensation.  Benefit costs accounted for 36
percent of  total compensation for union workers in March, 1995, and 27 percent
for non-union employees.</tt><p>
<tt>Mexico in 1994 had a $1.4 billion trade deficit with the US, as Mexicans
imported more than they exported.  In 1995, Mexico exported $15 billion more in
goods than it imported from the US--in 1996, Mexico may export a total $100
billion worth of goods.</tt><p>
<tt>The corruption scandal involving Raul Salinas, brother of ex-President
Carlos Salinas, prompted calls for the return of the ex-President to face
corruption charges.  Raul Salinas, on a government salary of less than $200,000
per year, bought numerous properties in Mexico, and stashed at least $100
million in accounts abroad.</tt><p>

<tt>South Korean immigrants are a prosperous community of about 35,000 in
Argentina.  South Koreans operate more<b> </b>about 1,000  businesses in
Argentina, many in the garment districts of Once and Flores.  There are<b>
</b>about 300 Korean cultural, athletic and business associations, and<b>
</b>some 30 Protestant churches with predominantly Korean congregations in the
country.</tt><p>
<tt>Some Jewish shop owners<b> </b>said that the South Koreans were "taking
over."  The South Koreans work 12 to 14 hours per day, sell merchandise at low
prices, and hire cheap labor from Bolivia.  </tt><p>
<tt>The first wave of South Korean immigrants to South America went to Brazil
in 1961.  The South Korean government persuaded Brazil to accept the
immigrants, and allowed each to take $40,000 to South America.  The second wave
of South Koreans came four years later to Argentina, Paraguay, and Chile.  From
1965 to 1985, about 6,000 South Koreans emigrated to Argentina and, by 1985,
there were 50,000 South Koreans in the Southern Cone nation. </tt><p>
<tt>Sociologists say that the South Koreans were successful in Argentina
because they shared credit and employment inside large families and because
they brought in cheap labor from neighboring countries.  A series of newspaper
articles published several years ago tarnished the image of South Korean
entrepreneurs, who were accused of operating sweat shops with undocumented
Bolivians .</tt><p>
<tt>The South Koreans charge that their success has led to discrimination
against them, aggravated by recession.</tt><p>
<tt>Argentinean police broke up a smuggling ring that helped smuggle Chinese
and Hong Kong residents through Argentina to Canada and the United States.  The
illegal immigrants paid about $30,000 dollars each for the voyage.  Many of the
immigrants were employed in Chinese restaurants while their documents to be
smuggled into the US or Canada were prepared.  Seventy-five immigrants were
captured and between 30 and 40 were deported. </tt><p>
<tt>After growing by over seven percent in 1994, economic growth in Argentina
slowed to one percent in 1995, prompting the government to crack down on
illegal immigrants.</tt><p>

<tt>In 1993, the US government spent $300 billion on programs for poor
residents through six major programs--Medicaid ($132 billion), food stamps and
SSI ($26 billion each), AFDC ($25 billion), low-income housing assistance ($20
billion), and Head Start and other compensatory education programs ($10
billion).  Under most of these programs, all individuals who qualify and apply
receive assistance, so that the annual cost of the program cannot be determined
precisely in advance.</tt><p>
<tt>Under welfare reforms approved by Congress, many of these federal
assistance programs will be capped at a certain level of funding, and the
moneys turned over to states in a block grant for the state to spend under
rules that they devise.  States would have to spend 25 cents of their funds to
assist the poor for every 75 cents received in the federal government block
grant.</tt><p>
<tt>Welfare reform with a time limit on cash assistance is moving closer to
reality.  Whether the time limit turns out to be two or five years, experts are
bracing for the movement into the labor force of four to five million adults
who now receive cash payments.</tt><p>
<tt>So far, 24 states have asked for federal approval of time limits on welfare
and, in one state, Michigan, one-third of the adults receiving general
assistance in 1992 found full-time jobs within two years of being forced off
the rolls.</tt><p>
<tt>On November 13, a House-Senate conference committee agreed to create a $3.5
billion fund to cover the cost of providing emergency health care to
unauthorized aliens in the 15 states with the most such residents over the next
five years.  In 1994, Congress for the first time approved funds to reimburse
states for the costs of incarcerating illegal aliens who commit crimes in the
US; the health funds are the first federal funds specifically earmarked for
covering states' health care service costs.  </tt><p>
<tt>If approved, the welfare reforms would make ineligible or restrict the
access of legal immigrants to federal welfare programs from food stamps to
AFDC. In addition, U.S. residents who sponsor their relatives to be immigrants
would have the affidavits they sign to show that the immigrant will not request
welfare benefits become legally binding until the immigrant becomes a US
citizen.</tt><p>
<tt>California has more than half of the estimated 1.5 million legal immigrants
currently receiving either Aid to Families With Dependent Children or
Supplemental Security Income.  There are 3.2 million foreign-born people in Los
Angeles county, and the county estimates that, if welfare reforms are enacted,
207,000 of the county's legal immigrants on Aid to Families With Dependent
Children, 276,000 on food stamps and 68,000 on Supplemental Security Income
could be cut off.</tt><p>
<tt>A profile of newcomers to the Sacramento area reported that families from
the ex-USSR arriving as refugees knew one English word--welfare.  Almost half
of the 75,000 refugees who settled in the Sacramento area since 1975 are on
welfare.  California's four million welfare recipients receive about $30
billion annually, and refugees reportedly receive about 10 percent of all
welfare benefits in the state.</tt><p>
<tt>One profile of a Pentecostal refugee family with 13 minor children noted
that, with AFDC payments of almost $1,300 per month, plus $1,000 in Food
Stamps, and health care, the family would have to earn $61,000 per year to be
better off working, an unlikely event since the parents did not speak English.
</tt><p>
<tt>Adult children in refugee families get $399 per month for eight months
while they attend English and job search classes, and then $299 per month in
general assistance.  Older family members get $513 per month in SSI payments.
There are about 20,000 Christians from the ex-USSR in the Sacramento
area.</tt><p>
<tt>Many other Russian immigrants denounce the tendency of Baptists and
Pentecostals with large families to arrive as refugees, and to get and stay on
welfare in the US.  According to some established Russians, California has made
it too easy to transfer from the Russian to the California welfare system, so
that, in the words of one, moving to the US is truly moving to the "promised
land."  </tt><p>
<tt>California has relatively generous welfare benefits, and automatic
eligibility, plus a weak economy, could lead to the surprise that so many,
rather than so few, refugees get off welfare.</tt><p>
<tt>St. Louis has about 80,000 immigrants and refugees, and expects to receive
another 20,000 before the end of the century.  Immigration to St. Louis
includes a wide range of  ethnic groups, from Russians to Ethiopians.  The
heterogeneity of the newcomers means that many languages and special
circumstances must be provided for, leading to gaps in services.  </tt><p>
<tt>The US State Department has deemed St. Louis a favorable site for
resettling refugees.  In the mid-1970s, many Vietnamese refugees who were sent
to St. Louis soon left for California. </tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC10">Reducing
Immigration</a> in Italy and Britain</a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>In November, 1995, Britain proposed and Italy adopted tough new measures
against illegal immigrants and the employers who hire them.  Britain's Asylum
and Immigration Bill includes employer sanctions, fines of up to L5,000 ($8000)
for knowingly hiring illegal workers, and a rule that would oblige schools and
hospitals to report suspected illegal immigrants.  </tt><p>
<tt>There were a record number of asylum applications in the UK in 1995: 36,000
to December, 1995, almost double the number in 1993.  The government is
proposing to deny them welfare and other benefits that total L215 million per
year. <b> </b>Asylum seekers would be ineligible for welfare benefits, and
those from "safe" countries of origin would be sent home while their
applications were considered.  On January 8, 1996 some 6,000 asylum applicants
in the UK were expected to lose their benefits, but in mid-December, the
government postponed the cut-off until Parliament has a chance to debate
it.</tt><p>
<tt>Critics of the measure contend the loss of benefits for asylum seekers will
result in homelessness. </tt><p>
<tt>About 70 percent of UK asylum applicants apply after they are inside the
UK, and half apply<b> </b>after being arrested in the U.K. for a criminal
offense.</tt><p>
<tt>In Italy, the government added criminal penalties to its employer sanctions
law by decree, and permitted the immediate expulsion of persons who lack
residence permits, and foreigners who commit crimes in Italy.  Italy reported
that 15,000 foreigners, mainly from Albania, were caught in the southern Puglia
region between May and November, 1995.</tt><p>
<tt>The European Parliament on December 13, 1995 discussed the report on the
EU's progress on issues covered by Title VI of the Maastricht Treaty.  That
section of the 1992 Treaty on European Union (TEU) provided the legal framework
for a reinforcement of intergovernmental cooperation between the EU Member
governments in the field of Justice and Home Affairs - the so-called "Third
Pillar of the Treaty".  Under the Maastricht treaty, immigration policy is
classified as a "question of common interest" and thus subject to the adoption
of minimum EU standards.  </tt><p>
<tt>The European Parliament has been urging the European Commission to play a
more active role in promoting freedom of movement, including the movement
inside Europe of third-party nationals settled in one EU country, and to
monitor the treatment of asylum seekers.  </tt><p>
<tt>For example, a majority of the EP voted to make sexual violence a
recommended ground for EU nations to grant asylum, and to broaden Article 1A of
the Geneva Convention to make eligible for asylum all persons persecuted in
their countries, even if the persecution is not carried out by the government.
A majority of the EP also voted to recommend that employers with illegal
workers who fail to contribute required payroll taxes should pay such taxes
into a fund to promote the reintegration of returned illegal aliens.  The EP
also urged EU nations to permit dual nationality for legal residents.</tt><p>
<tt>However, EU activities in immigration and other social issues are governed
by "subsidiarity," the principle that national governmental units should deal
with the issues they are best equipped to handle.  Subsidiarity and an ongoing
Social Dialogue between employers and workers are arguments used against
further EU activities in social issues.</tt><p>
<tt>In June 1995, EU Justice and Interior Ministers adopted a resolution that
established the general principal that asylum seekers should have the right of
appeal if their applications are rejected, and should be allowed to remain in
the country while the appeal is pending.  However, this principal of appeal and
temporary stay does not apply if the ground for rejection is that the applicant
could and should have sought asylum in a "safe-third country" through which he
passed en route to the country of application.</tt><p>
<tt>France, the Netherlands, Denmark, Finland and Germany have national
legislation that follows this principal; the other EU members are expected to
adopt such legislation by January 1, 1996.</tt><p>
<tt>In France, a December 1994 law targeted at alien smugglers caught several
"ordinary people" in its web, such as the French woman who received a suspended
three-month jail term for failing to report her illegal Congolese
fianc&eacute;.  Both France and Spain have warned African countries that their
aid and trade concessions depend on these countries' help in curbing
emigration.</tt><p>
<tt>Most European countries have separate systems for dealing with
unaccompanied asylum applicants aged 16 and under--they are often housed and
cared for at least several months before their applications for asylum are
dealt with.  As one result, some parents in Turkey and ex-Yugoslavia are
sending their children abroad alone.</tt><p>
<tt>In the 1990s, European nations have unemployment rates that are double the
US rate, a sharp reversal from the 1960s, when European unemployment rates were
half the US rate--the EU's unemployment rate for 1995 is expected to average
10.7 percent.  There are many analyses of causes and cures, with the most
common prescription being to scale back the welfare state--reduce the amount
and duration of unemployment insurance payments, reduce minimum wages and
payroll taxes, and make it easier to dismiss workers-- so that unemployed
workers are more willing to lower their expectations and accept new jobs, even
at lower wages or in a different area, and employers are more willing to hire
them.  </tt><p>
<tt>In the US, workers tend to leave areas experiencing high unemployment,
which is why differences in state unemployment rates do not persist.  In
Europe, by contrast, the adjustment to higher unemployment often involves a
shrinking of the labor force, as women and older workers drop out of the labor
force.</tt><p>
<tt>One analyst of why "Euroschlerosis" is much discussed and little tackled
observes that the clear winners from more flexible and presumably lower wage
labor markets are relatively few--stock owners, some unemployed workers who get
jobs, and the skilled workers whose wages rise because the unemployed workers
are employed.</tt><p>
<tt>There is no obvious relationship between the percentage of foreigners in
European populations and the unemployment rate--Portugal had relatively few
foreigners (one percent) and a low unemployment rate (four percent), while
Belgium had about nine percent foreigners, and 10 percent unemployment.  These
examples imply that the more foreigners, the more unemployment.</tt><p>
<tt>EU officials and national governments are attempting to deal with problems
arising from<b> </b>the recruitment of "hostesses" and "dancers" for jobs in
western Europe.  In some cases, smugglers have been able to take advantage of
laws that provide relatively easy entry for "artists." </tt><p>
<tt>Women, who suffer much higher unemployment rates in Eastern Europe than
men, are induced to be prostitutes in western Europe.  An estimated 75 percent
of the Netherlands' 10,000 prostitutes are foreigners.  Switzerland offered
1800 visas to "dancers" in 1994, one-third of whom were from eastern
Europe.</tt><p>
<tt>EU leaders in mid-December agreed to consider the applications of eastern
European nations to join the EU at the end of 1997.</tt><p>
<tt>Migration was discussed extensively at the "EuroMed" conference in
Barcelona in late November, with North Africans complaining that illegal
immigration was often discussed in conjunction with terrorism and drugs rather
than trade.  According to some Europeans, migration from North African and
Turkey is simply repeating 1960s migrations from southern Europe to northern
Europe. </tt><p>
<tt>Some 2.6 million Moslems are believed to have legally migrated to Europe in
the past five yeas, and the Barcelona summit aims at stabilizing Algeria,
Tunisia and Morocco to prevent more migration.  However, Spain is building with
EU assistance a $25 million road and fence between its Cueta enclave in North
Africa and Morocco, and requiring the 2,000 Moroccans who commute to Gibraltar
to obtain visas if they wish to leave Gibraltar for Spain.  Cueta is a
seven-square mile Spanish city of 75,000 in North Africa.  Africans trying to
reach Europe rioted in October 1995 to protest Spain's refusal to move them to
Spain.<b>  </b></tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC11">Germany</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>:
Bosnians, Illegals, and Immigration</a></a></a></a></a> 
</a></h2>
<tt>The Bosnia peace plan signed in mid-December in Paris has turned the
spotlight on the 350,000 Bosnians living in Germany as "tolerated" (geduldet)
foreigners who can stay in Germany at least through March 31, 1996, but not
earn the right to live there.  In addition, there are 350,000 Bosnians living
in other European countries, 820,000 in other ex-Yugoslavia states, and 1.3
million displaced within Bosnia.</tt><p>
<tt>Under the peace plan, the Bosnians in Europe will be the last to be
returned to Bosnia, and some wonder if they will be willing to return.  The
Bosnians scattered around Germany live rent-free in accommodations provided by
local authorities-- a family of four receives about $250 per week for food etc.
Many complain of boredom, but note that conditions in Bosnia remain
uncertain.</tt><p>
<tt>Between 35,000 and 30,000 Bosnian refugees live in Berlin.  Berlin spends
about US $333 million per year on them. </tt><p>
<tt>One refugee couple -- the woman is Croatian and the husband is Serbian
--<b> </b>announced that they plan to divorce and marry German partners<b>
</b>if they are threatened with expulsion from Germany. </tt><p>
<tt>On November 23, 1995, the German foreigners' commissioner, Cornelia
Schmalz-Jacobsen, released her second 150-page report on the status of
foreigners in Germany with the observation that German policies toward
foreigners are changing for the better.  As evidence, the report notes that
some foreigners now have the RIGHT to German citizenship
(Einb&uuml;rgerungsanspr&uuml;che)--meaning that the burden of denying some
foreigners German citizenship falls on the government.  </tt><p>
<tt>The report advocates further liberalization, "so that long-term 'foreign'
residents become part of German society."  The report uses the word migrant
rather than foreigner.</tt><p>
<tt>There are about seven million foreigners or migrants in Germany (the number
rose by about 100,000 in 1994, largely as a result of about 113,000 births to
foreigners in Germany) including two million Turks, 1.3 million nationals of
the ex-Yugoslavia, 572,000 Italians, 356,000 Greeks, and 263,000 Poles.  In
addition there were 1.75 million registered war refugees and asylum-seekers in
Germany at the end of 1994.</tt><p>
<tt>In Germany, cities such as Munich have begun a debate over further
restrictions on foreigners in public housing.  Under current procedures,
foreigners can be a maximum<b> </b>of 20 percent of the residents of local
public housing, a percentage that may be lowered.  Almost one fourth of
Munich's 1.6 million residents are foreigners, many of whom have formed
associations.  For example, there are believed to be over 3,000 associations
for Turks living in Germany.</tt><p>
<tt>About nine percent of the 2.5 million foreigners in the German labor force
were self-employed in 1992.  Thus about the same percentage of foreigners and
Germans are self employed.  About 17 percent of the 222,000 foreigners who were
self-employed were Italians, followed by 14 percent Turks, and 10 percent
Greeks.  About 25 percent of the foreigners' businesses were hotels and
restaurants, followed by 20 percent in manufacturing, and 14 percent in
retailing.</tt><p>
<tt>About 2.1 million foreigners were German wage and salary workers in 1994.
The unemployment rate for foreign workers was 17 percent in 1994, versus nine
percent for Germans.</tt><p>
<tt>Most of the Schmalz-Jacobsen report is devoted to the status of foreigners
in Germany.  More than half of the 20- to 30-year old foreign women in Germany,
and almost half of the young men, do not have a secondary school leaving
certificate, which in Germany usually includes certification that the school
leaver has learned one of 435 occupations.  The major reasons for these
education deficiencies include lack of the German language and family
circumstances that fail to emphasize the importance of education.</tt><p>
<tt>Schmalz-Jacobsen notes that foreigners cannot apply for many public sector
jobs, and that they are entitled to less priority for scarce higher education
slots than German citizens.  The report ends with recommendations for steps to
promote the integration of migrants in Germany.</tt><p>
<tt>The weekly news magazine Der Spiegel carried a cover story on illegal
immigration and employment in Germany in December.  According to the article,
about 100,000 aliens illegally enter and stay in Germany each year, despite an
increase in the number of German border guards from 2,000 in 1993 to 5,300 in
1995.  Day labor markets are evolving in major cities such as Frankfurt and
Berlin, where illegal workers seek child care, construction, and service
jobs.</tt><p>
<tt>Germany's labor ministry is responsible for preventing illegal workers from
getting jobs in Germany, and it enforces laws against the employment of illegal
alien workers, as well as against German workers unlawfully drawing
unemployment insurance or other aid while working for cash, by comparing
payroll tax and employment data, by checking foreign worker employment data
against a central register of data on foreigners, and by visiting construction
and similar workplaces and apprehending workers who run away, or inspecting the
work papers of those at work.  </tt><p>
<tt>There are 44 special labor offices with some 1,000 inspectors that
concentrate on illegal employment, plus another 500 inspectors available if
needed.</tt><p>
<tt>In Germany, workers receive an<b> </b>identification card showing the
insurance number that each person is required to have to be employed.  They
must show the ID to their employer when they begin to work, and the employer
must report the number to the local labor office within three days.  In some
industries, such as construction, janitorial services, and restaurants, workers
must carry their ID cards with them at work.  Workers must leave their ID cards
at the labor office while drawing unemployment insurance benefits--and check in
at the labor office frequently to prove that their availability for
work.</tt><p>
<tt>There were about 78,000 inspections for illegal foreign workers in 1994,
which resulted in 42,000 closed cases in which fines of an average of 550 DM
were levied on employers.  In 5,300 cases, criminal penalties were imposed.<b>
</b></tt><p>
<tt><b></b>The number of inspections was about 75,000 in 1993, 37,000 cases
were closed, and fines averaging 405 DM were levied---in 5,900 cases, criminal
penalties were levied.  Between 80 and 90 percent of the inspections and fines
are in the former West Germany.  Violations are most common in construction,
janitorial services, restaurants, agriculture, and food processing--inspectors
noted an increased number of cases in manufacturing, especially metal
processing.</tt><p>
<tt>In addition to employing illegal alien workers, German employers can be
fined for unlawfully lending their foreign workers to other employers--the
foreigners are to work in the job in which they were certified to come to
Germany.  In 1994, there were 5,800 inspections for unlawfully lending foreign
workers between German employers (illegale Arbeitnehmerueberlassung), versus
5,100 in 1993, and 3,100 closed cases (2,900 in 1993), and 370 criminal
penalties assessed (190).  Fines are much higher for transferring foreign
workers to another employer than simply employing unauthorized workers<b>
</b>--a total of<b> </b>23 million DM in 1994,<b> </b>and 21 million DM in
1993.</tt><p>
<tt>In October 1995, German authorities inspected the attendants in over 500
public toilets along highways and in department stores, and found that
virtually all were illegal aliens who had paid 500 DM each for the right to
work in the toilets for tips.  The firm that placed them is disputing a charge
that it knowingly employed illegal aliens--it maintains that the attendants are
independent contractors.</tt><p>
<tt>Germany invests more to restrict immigration than many other countries in
part because its relatively inflexible labor markets permit foreign workers to
depress German wages--Germans who do not move away from immigrant areas wind up
competing with immigrants for jobs. <b> </b>According to some estimates, a one
percent increase in the number of foreigners reduces unskilled and semi-skilled
workers' wages by six percent.  In November 1995, there were about 3.6 million
unemployed workers in Germany, for an unemployment rate of 9.3 percent.</tt><p>
<tt>There continues to be a debate in Germany over whether the country needs an
immigration system modeled on either the US or Canadian systems<b>.  </b>Most
social scientists recommend that Germany adopt an immigration system that would
admit a certain number of foreigners each year, and that labor certification or
a point system be used to determine priority to enter Germany as an
economically-useful immigrant.</tt><p>
<tt>According to Der Spiegel, about 100,000 family unification immigrants
arrive in Germany each year.  Spiegel seems to agree with those who argue that
Germany should follow the US and try to reduce illegal immigration by
establishing an annual<b> </b>ceiling on legal immigration--in this way, it is
argued, currently illegal aliens would wait for their turn to immigrate
legally.<b></b></tt><p>
<tt><b></b>Germany's foreign population increases by another 100,000 each year
through births to foreign permanent residents.  Adding slots for the entry of
permanent immigrants selected by German employers or on the basis of points
would presumably increase immigration, since family unification would
continue.</tt><p>
<tt>German academics have designed immigration systems that they believe will
raise German incomes and reduce unemployment.  For example, a proposal to use
unemployment rates, job vacancies, and wage increases to establish an annual
immigration quota would, according to one proposal, give extra points to, or
permit employers to obtain immigrants, in banking and insurance, research, and
machinery, but not construction.  In cases where there is both high
unemployment and job vacancies, and the work is unskilled, such as agriculture,
practical nursing, and restaurants, some academics propose a Swiss-style
rotational guest worker program.<b></b></tt><p>
<tt><b></b>Many Germans believe that they are recommending a US-style
immigration system.  However, the US selects only about 15 percent of its
immigrants (including their families) on economic grounds.  The US has
considered and rejected a Canadian-style point system, and the US program
adopted in 1990 to permit the immigration of persons investing money and
creating US jobs is widely considered a failure--very few foreigners with money
find it attractive.</tt><p>
<tt>The arrival of 225,000 so-called ethnic German Aussiedler each year from
the ex-USSR does not add to the foreign population because these newcomers
receive German passports upon their arrival.  There are about four million
ethnic Germans in eastern Europe and the ex-USSR, and two million have already
migrated to Germany.  Some 90,000 ethnic Germans have already completed the
paperwork that permits them to move to Germany, but have not yet done
so.</tt><p>
<tt>Representatives of over 3,000 Turkish groups and organizations met on
December 2 in Hamburg to establish an umbrella organization to promote the
interests of Germany's 2.1 million Turkish residents.  The non-partisan
organization, called TGD, wants to secure civic equality for all Turks living
in Germany.  One of the key changes the organization wants is dual citizenship,
though that is not wanted uniformly by all Turks in Germany. </tt><p>
<tt>All the debates<b> </b>in Turkey over the future of that country are
mirrored among Turks in Germany, especially over the role that Islam should
play in daily life.<b>  </b>For example, in Germany there are less expensive
burial sites, in which remains are plowed over after 15 years, and the space
reused for new burials.  Turks who selected this burial option for relatives
have sued Cologne to argue that Islam prohibits disturbing the remains of the
dead.</tt><p>
<tt>At the end of November 1995, the German Bundestag approved a resolution
that would permit the government to require 150,000 foreign construction
workers, many from other EU nations, to be paid at least the German minimum
construction wage from their first day of work in Germany (MN, December, 1995).
This two-year attempt to prevent "wage dumping" may not go into effect,
however, because non-union German employers must first negotiate minimum wages
with relevant unions, and then this minimum wage could be made binding
throughout the construction industry.</tt><p>

</a></h2>
<tt>On December 19 the French government announced another delay of several
months in opening its borders under the Schengen accord.  France continues to
insist that it must maintain strict border controls because of terrorist
attacks.  Another sticking point is the availability of drugs in its northern
neighbor, the Netherlands. </tt><p>
<tt>The French government pledged to give labor inspectors and customs
officials more powers to report migrant smuggling.  The government acted in
response to complaints of unfair competition from small businesses, and to
avoid the loss of social security and other payroll taxes.</tt><p>
<tt>French public sector employees struck to protest plans to reduce their
wages and benefits in late November and early December<b>.  </b>The French
government needs to reduce government expenditure to meet the Maastricht
requirements for a single currency.  Hence the plan to cut $55 billion over two
years.</tt><p>
<tt>The single largest savings would come from reducing state expenditures for
health care.  Other savings are expected from reorganizing the money-losing
railroads, from raising the retirement age for government employees from 60 to
65, and requiring 40 rather than 37 years of service to get the maximum
pension.  The 1.5 million students in 79 state-supported universities are
protesting plans to only modestly expand funding for higher education.</tt><p>
<tt>Unemployment in France is running at 11.5 percent. </tt><p>
<tt>In a trade-union vote by policemen in France, the extreme-right union
affiliated with Jean-Marie Le Pen won 13.4 percent.  A left-wing publication
interpreted the vote as meaning that there is now a one in eight chance of
being stopped for an identity check by an extreme-right policeman. </tt><p>

<tt>On December 13, the European Parliament approved by a vote of 343-143 a
free-trade union with Turkey that begins to reduce trade barriers on January 1,
1996, brushing aside concerns about Turkey's human rights record.  Turkish
President Suleyman Demirel said that it was an historic day for Turkey, and
that the country has "now entered a phase of much closer links with Europe."
</tt><p>
<tt>Under the terms of the 1963 Association Agreement between the EEC and
Turkey, Turks were to have freedom of movement with the EEC by 1976.  This
so-called Ankara Agreement was never fully implemented, but under the agreement
and subsequent protocols, Turks have preference over other "third-country
nationals" in gaining admission to EU nations to fill vacant jobs.</tt><p>
<tt>In 1973, an "additional protocol" was signed between the EU and Turkey that
planned for a customs union by 1995.  In March 1995, the EU and Turkey agreed
to a customs union effective January 1, 1996, if the EU Parliament approved.
Turkey modified its anti-terrorism law in October 1995 to permit some persons
jailed for "incitement" to be freed, paving the way for EU approval.  </tt><p>
<tt>Under the free-trade agreement, tariffs that average 14 percent on $20
billion in trade between Turkey and the EU will be eliminated; Turkey will
forego about $1.5 billion in tariff income, but it hopes to gain far more in EU
investment.</tt><p>
<tt>On December 24, Turkey held general elections in which the fundamentalist
Welfare Party (Refah) did better than expected, gaining 158 seats in the 550
member Parliament with 21 percent of the vote.  The Welfare Party promised
cheap bread, and delivered on its promises after winning municipal elections in
Ankara, Istanbul, and 22 other cities in 1994.</tt><p>
<tt>Turkey bills itself as a secular Moslem state, a stable friend of the West
in an unstable but strategic region.  However, its economy has faltered, with
inflation running at 80 percent, interest rates are 100 percent, and
unemployment is at least 20 percent.</tt><p>
<tt>Turkey on June 12 began to permit Turks who lose their Turkish nationality
by becoming a citizen of another country to retain their rights to property and
inheritance in Turkey.  However, Turkish youth living abroad are at age 18
obliged to perform 18 months of military service in Turkey, or pay DM10,000
($7,000) and have their service obligation in Turkey reduced to two months.
Turks who fail to perform military service or pay do not get their Turkish
passports renewed.</tt><p>
<tt>A report released by the Turk-Metal union finds that thousands of Kurds who
migrated to western Turkey have developed a radical brand of Kurdish
nationalism due to disillusionment.  The survey compared Kurds in the 10
southeastern provinces under emergency rule with those who lived in the six
western provinces, where many Kurds have gone to escape the effects of unrest.
</tt><p>
<tt>The report found that more than 20 percent of the Kurds living in western
Turkey said they accepted Turkish nationality for lack of choice; many wanted
more ethnic freedom.  Most Kurds living in the southeast wanted to remain part
of one nation.  The survey found that most Kurds leaving the southeast are
seeking employment and investment opportunities, rather than escaping the
security problems. </tt><p>

<tt>According to the Latvian president, he plans to sign the Geneva Convention
on the Rights of Refugees.  The president is also prepared to sign agreements
with Russia and Belorussia to return asylum seekers who transit through those
countries.</tt><p>
<tt>In a meeting with the Swedish prime minister in October, the Latvian
president asked other European nations to help fund the building of a camp for
asylum seekers.  The camp would cost an estimated $1.5 million.</tt><p>
<tt>Latvia is considering legislation that would impose up to 10-year jail
terms, plus confiscation of  any vehicles used, on persons caught smuggling
aliens into the country.</tt><p>
<tt>In March, a "train of despair," carried 100 Kurds  between Latvia,
Lithuania, and Russia for several weeks as each country rejected the Kurdish
asylum seekers from Afghanistan, Iraq, and Iran --half of whom were
children--and argued that they were the responsibility of the other.  In early
April, the refugees were moved to the prison building in a small town near
Riga, Latvia.  They have remained there for the past nine months, waiting for
Russia to agree to accept their return. </tt><p>
<tt>The Kurds, most of whom had paid $2,500 each to be smuggled to Sweden, were
on a ship that ran aground in Estonia, from which they were returned to Latvia.
Sweden, according to Latvia, announced that it would help Latvia to deport the
Kurds to Russia.  About 50 Middle Eastern asylum-seekers a month, or 10
boatloads a year, are smuggled into Sweden via the Baltic states.</tt><p>
<tt>Latvia is being criticized by Russia for its response to the suicide of a
Russian citizen in a Latvian town in July, 1995.  The Russian, who was unable
to obtain a residence permit, immolated himself to protest his impending
deportation. </tt><p>
<tt>Lithuania is continuing to try to set up mechanisms to deal with illegal
immigration.  Under pressure for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees and
Scandinavian governments, Lithuania promised to convert a former Soviet
military base into a detention center for asylum seekers, instead of forcing
them to depend upon the benevolence of the local people.  Lithuania hopes to
get financial support from Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Finland.  </tt><p>
<tt>Lithuania's Border Protection Service welcomed Russia's offers to provide
equipment to police the borders of the Baltic states.  The Commission of Border
Services hopes that the strengthened border guard will stem the flow of illegal
immigrants who travel through Lithuania on their way to the West. </tt><p>

<tt>A report on National Public Radio explored how the North Korean government
has been running about a dozen Siberian labor camps for the past 20 years.  The
camps have North Korean workers who provide cheap labor to log the birch and
pine forests in Siberia.  Moscow and North Korea then divide the profits from
the sale of the logs to countries like Japan.  </tt><p>
<tt>There were widespread claims of abuse after the labor camps became well
known following the collapse of the Soviet Union.  The North Korean workers are
now guaranteed protection under Russian labor laws, but there are reports that
worker abuse continues.  Many North Koreans are running away from the camps to
look for jobs because of food and equipment shortages.</tt><p>
<tt>Some Chinese and Korean migrant workers reportedly accept low wages while
working seasonally in Siberia in exchange for the ability to take home wild
ginseng for longevity potions and tiger bones and reindeer antlers for
aphrodisiacs.</tt><p>
<tt>The year-long Operation Foreigner, which cracked down on illegal
immigration in Russia's Maritime Territory, came to an end in late October,
1995.  Over 10,00 Chinese were returned to their homeland during the operation.
The operation also stopped attempts by Vietnamese and North Koreans to smuggle
out of Russia rare animals and plants. </tt><p>
<tt>According to the Russian government, some 40 million of Russia's 148
million residents have below poverty level incomes of less than $68 per month.

<tt>Jorg Haider's Freedom Party won 22 percent of the vote in Austria's
December 17, 1995 election, down from 23 percent in 1994.  Haider, who opposes
immigration, is considered the most successful far-right politician in
Europe.</tt><p>
<tt>During the campaign, Haider asserted that "Immigration cannot be continued
in our country."  At a rally he added that "We must adopt the principle
'Austria First' if we don't want to disappear slowly in a land full of
foreigners." Haider's Freedom Party issued its own "Contract with Austria,"
which pledged to cut taxes and budget deficits, fight crime, reduce the size of
government, and prevent Austria from becoming an immigration country.  Austrian
pundits compare him to Newt Gingrich.</tt><p>
<tt>The neighboring Czech Republic has come under fire for using strict
citizenship laws to prevent some of the 200,000 gypsies from becoming Czech
citizens.  After the breakup of Czechoslovakia in January, 1993, the Czech
Republic enacted some of Europe's toughest citizenship laws, requiring new
citizens, for example, to renounce their old citizenship, to prove that they
have a record clean of any criminal acts for five years, and to pay relatively
high fees.</tt><p>
<tt>Some 360,000 Slovaks have become Czech citizens since 1993, but most are
non-Gypsies.  The Council of Europe, founded in 1949, calls Czech efforts to
deny citizenship to Gypsies the "largest denationalization" since World War
II.</tt><p>
<tt>Neighboring Slovakia, in turn, is accused of using a vague language law to
restrict the rights of ethnic Hungarians, who are about 11 percent of the
population.</tt><p>

<tt>Many commentators expect Asia's rapid economic growth to be threatened by
too few professional and skilled workers.  Instead of deriving comparative
advantage from large numbers of cheap unskilled workers, as they have for the
past two decades, many commentators urge Asian nations to upgrade their
educational systems to produce more professionals, scientists, and
engineers.</tt><p>
<tt>For example, Hong Kong has an historically high unemployment rate--3.5
percent--and, simultaneously, large numbers of vacancies for skilled and
professional workers.  At the same time, professionals such as accountants,
nurses, and computer programmers from India to the Philippines cannot find jobs
that use these skills in their own countries.</tt><p>
<tt>Even countries attracting large amounts of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)
suffer from shortages of skilled and professional workers.  In Indonesia, for
example, about half of the university graduates entering the job market each
year are unemployed, but foreign investors complain that they cannot find local
supervisors and mid-level managers.  Foreign investors have similar complaints
in China, Malaysia, and Thailand about shortages of skilled workers and
technicians.</tt><p>
<tt>Many governments concerned about foreign workers and wanting to maintain
rapid economic growth agree that "the higher-end manufacturing base envisaged
by government planners will not materialize unless local education and training
systems are able to provide the sort of  skilled workers  required by potential
foreign investors."</tt><p>
<tt>However, in the US and Australia, countries that accept large numbers of
permanent and temporary foreigners on the basis of their skills, there is a
growing belief that easy access to foreigners discourages local workers from
training for occupations that have a significant number of foreign
workers.</tt><p>
<tt><b>Singapore</b>. Singapore Economic Development Board began to send
missions abroad in 1991 to recruit new graduates for jobs in Singapore.<b> </b>
The missions permit local companies to screen candidates in India, the US, and
Australia for professional jobs in computer science and engineering.  In 1994,
about 500 jobs were offered to foreign professionals--40 percent Indians and
Sri Lankans--and 40 percent in computer science and engineering.</tt><p>
<tt>There are over 100,000 mostly unskilled Malaysian workers in Singapore, but
a decision of the Singaporean government to exempt after August 1, 1995 foreign
workers and their employers from contributing about 20 percent each of their
gross pay to the Central Provident Fund (CPF) was expected to attract
additional skilled and professional workers to Singapore.  The 300,000 work
permit holders whose employers are required to pay the Foreign Workers' Levy
were exempt from CPF contributions.</tt><p>
<tt>Under Singapore's levy system, employers pay a levy of S$200 (US $150) per
skilled worker each month instead of S$440 for unskilled workers.</tt><p>
<tt><b>Malaysia</b>. <b> </b>Malaysia established a Human Resources Development
Fund (HRDF) in 1992 to promote the training of skilled workers, with highest
priority for the printing, plastics, steel and iron, electronic and electrical,
and textile industries.  The Fund makes grants to firms that establish training
facilities, and rebates up to 20 percent of the firms' contributions to the
HRDF if the firm establishes training facilities at its production site.</tt><p>
<tt><b>Japan.</b>  The number of foreigners employed in Japan has decreased by
about three percent since 1993, but the number of foreigners employed as
engineers and managers increased about 15 percent.  Many Japanese firms are
hiring foreigners as permanent workers, hoping they will become candidates for
jobs in overseas offices.<b></b></tt><p>
<tt><b>Outside Asia</b>.  The US, Canada, and Australia have programs through
which professionals and skilled foreigners can enter as temporary or permanent
immigrants.  In all three countries, these immigration systems are coming under
attack.</tt><p>
<tt>In Australia, unions in April 1995 complained that the government was
permitting the entry of 30 British tool makers for 18 to 24 months despite high
unemployment.  Australia uses a point system to select permanent immigrants on
the basis of their skills, and the 1993-94 intake included 445 doctors, 324
civil engineers, 537 secondary school teachers, 210 lawyers, 149 economists and
114 architects, as well as 652 accountants, 830 computing professionals, 543
nurses, 288 carpenters and 366 vehicle mechanics.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC19">Thailand:
Immigra</a></a></a>tion Controls Not Working</a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>The Thai government has requested recommendations from the Thailand
Development and Research Institute and the National Economic and Social
Development Board on ways to reduce illegal immigration.  New policies to curb
illegal immigration are expected to be implemented by June, 1996. </tt><p>
<tt>The Thai government has been frustrated because current immigration
controls such as fines and deportation have not worked.  A majority of the
illegal immigrants are Burmese, who have not been stopped by a requirement to
have work permits.  An estimated 100,000 Burmese have fled the unrest in their
own country over the past two years and have settled in Thailand's border
areas.  A total of 500,000 Burmese are believed live in Thailand.</tt><p>
<tt>To retaliate against the Burmese who have left for Thailand, the Democratic
Karen Buddhist Army has been encroaching into Thailand to harass Burmese in
refugee camps.  According to reports, the Thai guards, who are sometimes warned
of an impending attack, view the raids as an internal problem between the two
Karen groups and ignore their intrusion onto Thai soil. </tt><p>
<tt>There has been little coordination between the various Thai ministries to
agree upon a government policy toward Burma.  Therefore, there is no firm
policy about security at the refugee camps.  The guards at the camps do not
have the authority to retaliate against the attacks, and even if they did, they
are not equipped to halt the attacks.  Thai officials have dissuaded relief
workers from helping the Karen refugees because the government says it wants to
send the Karens back as soon as possible.</tt><p>
<tt>The UN has been unable to assist the Karens in the camps because the Thai
government has termed them "displaced" persons rather than refugees. </tt><p>
<tt>One reason there has been a reluctance to establish a firm policy is
because the illegal foreign workers are considered a benefit to Thailand-- they
fill vacant unskilled and semi-skilled jobs at low wages. </tt><p>

Refugee Resettlement</a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>The US in December made another effort to return the 37,000 Vietnamese
still languishing in camps in Asia to Vietnam, despite plans by one US
Congressman to deny US funds to the UN help resettle the boat people in
Vietnam.  The last Vietnamese were expected to be home be the end of 1995, but
only 5,000 were returned in 1995, versus 12,500 in 1994.</tt><p>
<tt>Under the US plan, Vietnamese in the camps would be taken to Ho Chi Minh
City by the UN, and interviewed as they returned to Vietnam by US immigration
officials.  If the "several thousand" among the returning Vietnamese can prove
that they worked with the US during the war, and can qualify as political
refugees, they could come to the US.  Most of the other Vietnamese would be
expected to resettle in Vietnam.</tt><p>
<tt>The UN planned to empty Vietnamese from the camps in 1995, but Vietnamese
in the camps refused to return after US House approved $30 million to bring
Vietnamese in the camps to the US.  The legislation was not approved by
Congress, but many of the 20,000 Vietnamese in Hong Kong believe that China's
1997 takeover will force the US to accept them.  Many Hong Kong residents
believe the Vietnamese should return; the UNHCR owes Hong Kong $130 million for
costs it incurred to house the Vietnamese.</tt><p>
<tt>Many of the refugees do not want to be returned to Vietnam and some
Republican legislators are reluctant to send them forcibly back to Vietnam.  A
Republican amendment attached to the federal budget bill would prohibit the
forced repatriation of economic migrants, and would block US payments to UNHCR
if UNHCR continues forced repatriations.  </tt><p>
<tt>Thailand, Vietnam and UNHCR signed a memorandum of understanding to
repatriate the last 5,000 Vietnamese refugees in Thailand by the middle of
1996. </tt><p>
<tt>Vietnam has asked for more time to repatriate the remaining 2,600
Vietnamese refugees in the Philippines.  The delay is partly due to the budget
impasse in the US Congress, because the US agreed to help pay for the refugees
return.  The UNHCR has said it will not fund the refugee camp in the
Philippines past December 31, 1995, so the Philippine government has said it
will pay for the cost of housing and feeding the Vietnamese refugees.  UNHCR
wanted to move the refugees to a UN center in Vietnam until the repatriation
agreement had been signed. </tt><p>
<tt>On December 12, the Australian government deported 68 Sino-Vietnamese
asylum seekers.  The 68 asylum-seekers were from a group of about 900 who
arrived in Australia from the Beihai region of China late last year.  Under an
agreement between Australia and China, Sino-Vietnamese refugees who had been
resettled in China are not permitted to apply for refugee status in another
country. </tt><p>

<tt>The Pacific Business Forum, 36 representatives from large and small to
medium-sized business from each of APEC's<b> </b>18-member countries,
recommended that APEC nations simplify procedures for obtaining business
residency visas by 1996 and implement visa-free travel throughout the region by
1999.</tt><p>
<tt>However, Australia reported in December that 4,000 of the 5.8 million
foreigners seeking to enter the country were turned back because they had
forged documents.  Some Asians reportedly pay up to $5,000 each to buy papers
that say they are managers or accountants, travel to Australia for business
reasons, work as factory workers and, if apprehended, apply for asylum.  There
are an estimated 75,000 illegal aliens in Australia, mostly British and
Chinese.</tt><p>
<tt>APEC, established in 1989, includes 18 nations that produced over half of
the world's $24 trillion GDP in 1993, with the US and Japan accounting for
almost 80 percent of APEC's economic output.  There are enormous differences in
per capita incomes between APEC member nations--per capita GDP ranged from
$34,000 in Japan in 1993 to $450 in China.</tt><p>
<tt>APEC member nations account for almost half of global trade, worth $7.4
trillion in 1993.  The November 1995 APEC summit in Osaka, Japan was supposed
to take steps to implement free trade among the richer APEC members by the year
2010, and free trade among all APEC members by 2020. </tt><p>
<tt>ASEAN, established in 1967, includes Brunei, Indonesia, the Philippines,
Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam--Burma, Cambodia and Laos are
expected to join by the year 2000.  In 1992, these nations agreed to establish
a free trade zone--AFTA-- by the year 2000 which would include 450 million
people.</tt><p>
<tt>One International Labour Office estimate puts the number of migrant workers
employed outside their country of citizenship worldwide at 25 million,
including 13 million in Asia.</tt><p>
<tt>A recent study by the University of Indonesia found that 19 percent of
foreign workers in Indonesia were South Koreans, followed by Japanese, 15
percent; and Taiwanese, nine percent.  </tt><p>
<tt>UNCTAD--the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development-- reported
in mid-December that foreign direct investment (FDI) topped $235 billion in
1995--including 37 percent or $87 billion to LDCs-- the worldwide stock of FDI
is now $2.5 trillion.  The US is the major overseas investor, investing $46
billion abroad in 1994, and receiving $49 billion in FDI from other countries
in 1994.  </tt><p>
<tt>Japan and Germany combined invested only $39 billion abroad in 1994.  Japan
was the number one overseas investor between 1986 and 1991, with a peak
overseas investment of $48 billion in 1990, but the US has been the leading
overseas investor since 1991.</tt><p>
<tt>Most FDI comes from the world's 40,000 multinationals, most of which are
based in industrial countries, and invest in other industrial nations.  China
received $27 billion in FDI in 1994, and FDI in LDCs is expected to top $90
billion in 1995.  However, LDCs invested $33 billion abroad in 1994, and
Mexico's Cemex, with $3.6 billion invested abroad, is the developing world's
largest foreign investor.  </tt><p>
<tt>The world's 40,000 multinationals account for about two-thirds of all world
trade, and half of multinational trade is between affiliates of the same
multinational. There are 40,000 multinationals, and they have 250,00 foreign
affiliates with sales of $5.2 trillion in 1994.</tt><p>

Foreigners Employment</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>China is developing legislation to regulate the employment of foreigners in
the country.  The current Law of the People's Republic of China on Entry and
Exit of Aliens has only general principles, so that it is implemented
differently by local authorities.  </tt><p>
<tt>According to Chinese authorities, the government must "exclude foreigners
entering China in search of high salaries and a low cost of living."  Unskilled
foreigners seeking to work will be denied work permits.  One official said
that, "With China's opening up and rapid development, more and more aliens are
coming to this ancient country, attracted by its long history, profound culture
and relatively more employment opportunities and better pay."</tt><p>
<tt>There are about 70,000 foreigners employed in China, and 80 percent of the
30,000 foreigners who work in China for more than one year are employed by
foreign-funded enterprises.</tt><p>
<tt>The crackdown is due in part to an clash that occurred when a wealthy
villager in Shenzhen rode his motorcycle through a blockade onto a road which
had just been tarred by migrant workers.  A melee began when the villager
called police--in the ensuing violence, 11 workers were killed by paramilitary
troops with submachine guns.  </tt><p>
<tt>Shenzhen is a special economic zone in Guangdong province, which borders
Hong Kong's New Territories, that relies on cheap migrant labor to attract
foreign investment.  The migrant workers were mostly from the poor provinces of
Hunan and Hubei.  According to a public security official, 80 to 90 percent of
all crimes in Guangdong province were committed by migrants. </tt><p>
<tt>South of Beijing, the army began a crackdown on migrants by razing a ghetto
of 100,000 peasants who had ventured there from the southern province of
Shejuang over the past 10 years.  Zheijiang "village" was the capital's main
shoe and garment making district.  The village also ran its own clinics,
schools, recreation halls, shops and had its own police.  The army claimed that
the ghetto was a slum that harbored criminals.</tt><p>
<tt>According to the Chinese official media, the army is prepared to raze
another 18 migrant villages around Beijing.  The villages are home to about
three million people, about one-fourth of the capital's population.  The cities
of Shanghai and Canton (Guangzhou) are also expected to raze migrant ghettos.
</tt><p>
<tt>One Chinese city, Xiamen is honoring ten outstanding youths from among the
city's 300,000 migrant workers.  The honors are a first for China.  The winners
of the competition will get long-term contracts and become permanent city
residents. </tt><p>
<tt>China's population policy is reportedly threatened by its growing migrant
population.  Chinese officials say that migrancy makes it difficult to carry
out family planning.  Experts estimate that about two-thirds of the unplanned
births are in transient families.  </tt><p>
<tt>China's 250 million urban residents are required to obtain permission from
neighborhood officials before having a child.  Those who have children without
permission cannot get a household registration and welfare benefits.</tt><p>
<tt>In central China's Henan province, local government officials have reduced
the number of births among the migrants by requiring them to produce "family
planning certificates" before applying for transient identification cards or
business licenses.  Currently, about 85 percent of the migrant workers in Henan
have the certificates. </tt><p>

their labor concerns to the government's National Labour Advisory Council
(NLAC) instead of teaming up with an opposition political party to publicize
complaints about foreign workers.  The government's Task Force on Foreign
Workers recommended that all foreign workers be paid at least a "reasonable

</a></h2>
<tt>On December 15, the Japanese Supreme Court upheld the law that requires
foreigners living legally in Japan to be fingerprinted.  The fingerprinting
requirement has long been seen as a symbol of discrimination against
foreigners, since it suggests a similarity with criminals. The Japanese Supreme
Court ruled that since the procedure involved only one finger, it "should not
cause excessive psychological or physical pain." </tt><p>
<tt>There were about 94,000 foreigners working legally in Japan in 1994, down
about 3,000 from 1993.  About 60 percent of these legal foreign workers are not
managers and professionals, and their number declined by 10 percent.</tt><p>
<tt>An article in the Fresno Bee compares the work done by illegal foreign
workers in Japan with California.  In both places, illegal foreign workers are
hired primarily in jobs natives do not want.  In California, it is work in
agriculture or factories, and in Japan it is in construction or machinery
plants.  The primary difference is that in California the foreign workers do
not stand out the way they do in homogenous Japan, where national identity if
paramount.   </tt><p>

<tt>Kuwait's Ministry of Planning reported in December that the country's
population of 1.9 million included 700,000 Kuwaitis and 1.2 million foreigners.
There are over 200,000 Egyptians in Kuwait.</tt><p>
<tt>In Saudi Arabia, the interior minister asserted that "the private sector is
under an obligation to find jobs for citizens." Saudis hold four per cent of
the jobs in the industrial sector and 12 percent of service sector jobs--
foreigners  fill the rest.  There are about 6.2 million foreigners from 190
countries among the 17 million residents.  </tt><p>
<tt>Saudi foreign workers remitted about $15 billion to their countries of
origin in 1994, up from $4 billion in 1980.  Indians, Egyptians and Pakistani
workers are the largest nationalities.</tt><p>
<tt>There are 200,000 foreigners among Bahrain's 540,000 residents, and Bahrain
is attempting to substitute native for foreign workers by raising the tax on
foreigners beginning in 1996.  Unemployed, educated youths from Bahrain's
majority Shi'ite Muslim community demonstrated in the streets of Bahrain and
attacked foreign worker compounds.</tt><p>
<tt>In the United Arab Emirates, about 75 percent of the 2.3 million residents
are foreigners.</tt><p>
<tt>Jordan ordered illegal foreign workers out of the country by October 26,
1995, and 70,000 illegal workers--mostly Egyptians and Jordanians--of the total
foreign work force of 250,000 reportedly left by the deadline.  Most of the
illegal foreign workers had agricultural work permits, but were employed in
nonfarm jobs.  Employers could legalize their illegal foreign workers, and
about 102,000 foreign workers were regularized by their employers.</tt><p>
<tt>Egyptians are 80 percent of the 200,000 foreign workers in Jordan, followed
by Syrians, who are eight percent of Jordan's foreign workers.  About 37
percent of Jordan's foreign workers are in agriculture, followed by 26 percent
in services.  Over 93 percent of the foreign workers in Jordan earn less than
$140 per month.</tt><p>
<tt>Arabs do not need visas to enter Jordan, and many Egyptians entered the
country and took mostly low-wage jobs in agriculture, cleaning, and
construction--there are an estimated 60,000 foreign construction workers in
Jordan.  Jordan's unemployment rate was 18 per cent of a work force of one
million in 1995.  In August 1995, foreigners were banned from 15 professions,
including medicine, engineering, administration, secretarial and retail
businesses, hair dressing, drivers, messengers, cars mechanics and
education.</tt><p>
<tt>The number of Afghani refugees in Iran continues to decline.  From a peak
three to four million, there are now only 1.5 million left in Iran.</tt><p>
<tt>The closure of the Israeli territories has lead to a shortage of pomelo
pickers, according to the Citrus Marketing Board on October 30, 1995.  The
board reported that if the Israeli government does not supply more foreign
workers, large orders of pomelos for the Japanese market will be lost. </tt><p>

3, 1995.  "Jordan cuts  foreign workers," Financial Times, November 28, 1995.

<tt>This report pairs five cities of similar population size but high and low
percentages of foreign-born persons in 1990 and concludes that, on 44
indicators from the 1990 Census, the low immigration cities scored better.
Four of the five cities are in California--Long Beach, Oakland, Santa Ana, and
Stockton, and they are paired with the midwestern cities of Oklahoma City,
Tulsa, St. Paul, and Lexington.</tt><p>
<tt>In the 1990 Census, the "high-immigration" cities had from 20 percent
foreign-born residents (Oakland) to 60 percent (Miami), while the
"low-immigration" cities typically had about three percent foreign-born
residents.</tt><p>

Illegal Aliens = No
Contracts</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a</a></a></a></a></a></a></h2>
<tt>President Clinton pledged in his January 23, 1996 State of the Union speech
to issue an Executive Order that might bar companies convicted of knowingly
hiring unauthorized workers from doing business with the federal government for
one year.  Further violations could extend the bar.</tt><p>
<tt>An estimated 26 million persons are employed by federal contractors and
subcontractors.</tt><p>
<tt>Clinton said: "After years and years of neglect, this administration has
taken on a strong stand to stiffen protection on our borders.  We are
increasing border patrols by 50 percent; we are increasing inspections to find
illegal immigrants in the workplace.  And tonight, I announce I will sign an
executive order to deny federal contracts to business that hire illegal
immigrants.  But let me be clear: we are still a nation of immigrants, and we
honor all those immigrants who are working hard to become new citizens.  But we
are also a nation of laws. " </tt><p>
<tt>Employers could still get federal contracts if they were fined for
paperwork violations, such as incomplete I-9 forms.  Most INS fines are for
paperwork violations--in Northern California, for example, only about 10
percent of the INS fines levied on employers since 1988 have been for knowingly
hiring illegal workers.  Since 1988, there have been 16,570 INS notices of
intent to fine US employers, including 1,427 in FY95.</tt><p>
<tt>The Executive Order would establish a system for federal agencies to be
notified if a company is caught employing unauthorized workers.  Under one
version of the plan, the INS would notify the federal agency that does the most
business with an employer who hired illegal aliens.  The federal government let
85,000 new contracts in 1994, and purchased goods and services worth $200
billion.</tt><p>
<tt>One agency frequently criticized is the General Services Administration,
which has in some cases not taken action against contractors who have hired
illegal aliens to build or maintain the 7,000 owned and leased buildings in
which federal government employees work.</tt><p>
<tt>Some see the proposed Executive Order as another symbolic effort to show
that the Administration is getting tough on illegal immigration.  Federal
contractors are already required to obey federal and state laws, and the
government publishes a monthly list of firms ineligible for federal
contracts.</tt><p>
<tt>If enacted, it is not clear how soon the Executive Order would enter into
force.  A March 1995 Executive Order that makes ineligible for federal
contracts businesses that permanently replace striking workers has been held up
in court, and is not yet in effect.</tt><p>
<tt>Republicans sponsors of immigration reform proposals in Congress supported
the President's action, suggesting that it would further their efforts to
combat the employment of illegal immigrants.</tt><p>
<tt>Former Texas Congresswoman Barbara Jordan, chair of the US Commission on
Immigration Reform, died on January 17, leaving the CIR without a national
spokesperson.  Jordan had been instrumental in shaping a consensus immigration
issues.</tt><p>

<tt>Alien apprehensions doubled along the US-Mexican border in December 1995
versus year earlier levels.  To prevent what some feared would be a massive
surge of illegal immigrants, the INS on January 16, 1996 added 300 more agents
to the California-Arizona borders to discourage illegal entrants returning
after Christmas visits to Mexico and Central America.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS offered Spanish language videos to broadcast systems in the
Caribbean and Latin America that warned potential illegal aliens that the
stepped-up border controls will make it harder to return to the US illegally
after holiday visits home.  The INS also said that it intends to prosecute
repeat violators of US immigration laws.</tt><p>
<tt>Some Mexican workers who viewed the 30-minute broadcast on December 20
doubted that it would deter them from returning to the US.  The broadcast is
scheduled to be repeated at least two more times.</tt><p>
<tt>The stepped-up border control efforts include an agreement to reimburse
local police forces for cooperating with the INS by, e.g., helping to transport
aliens apprehended.  The Border Patrol is being backed up by 350 members of the
Marine and Army units deployed under the military's Joint Task Force 6, which
has been helping to battle drug trafficking since 1988.  While the Army is
prohibited by law from performing immigration-related duties, the troops can
assist in operating night scopes, motion sensors and communications gear.
</tt><p>
<tt>National Guard units from California and Arizona will also assist the
Border Patrol.  The California Assembly, on a 41-32 vote on January 30, 1995,
approved the sending of the National Guard to the border.</tt><p>
<tt>Republican Presidential candidate Lamar Alexander on January 30, 1995
proposed that the Immigration and Naturalization Service be replaced with a new
branch of the armed forces to patrol America's borders.</tt><p>
<tt>Mexican officials expressed their "deep concern" on January 12 about the
use of US military units at the border; several asserted that stepped-up border
enforcement could harm US-Mexico relations and increase human rights abuses.
Several Mexican officials said that the US did not consult with the Mexican
government before taking the action.</tt><p>
<tt>On January 14, Mexican lawmakers announced that they plan to ask the United
Nations to demand that the US stop using troops along the Mexican
border.</tt><p>
<tt>Many newspapers attributed the stepped-up border enforcement to
election-year politics.  For example, a Los Angeles Times editorial asserted
that the major reason for the stepped-up border enforcement was to garner
critical California votes.  The paper argued that it would have been better to
speed up naturalization to get votes.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS has three special border control operations:  Operation
Hold-the-Line in El Paso, Texas; Operation Safeguard south of Tucson, Arizona;
and, Operation Gatekeeper, south of San Diego, California.  </tt><p>
<tt>The INS has 25,000, including 5,600 Border Patrol agents.  About 40 percent
of the Border Patrol agents are Hispanic. </tt><p>
<tt>On January 6, President Clinton signed legislation that raises the INS
annual budget from $2.1 billion in FY95 to $2.6 billion in FY96.  The INS is
planning to more than double the number of investigators assigned to enforcing
employer sanctions, from 320 to 704.  </tt><p>
<tt>There were about 6,000 INS investigations of employers for immigration
violations in FY95, down sharply from almost 15,000 in FY89.  The INS assessed
employers $4 million in fines in 1989, and $4.1 million in 1995.</tt><p>
<tt>The northern border states are reporting increased illegal immigration.  In
Idaho, the border chief reports that the number of apprehensions rose 11
percent from FY 1994 to FY 1995.  The Border Patrol reports that most illegal
aliens are apprehended in the Twin Falls area, and  are attracted there  by
agricultural jobs. </tt><p>
<tt>Some critics have noted that the Clinton Administration's approach to
sanctions enforcement seems to be targeting illegal workers rather than their
employers.  They see INS operations such as Southpaw as similar to early 1980s
Operation Jobs, which removed aliens from jobs that were to be filled by US
workers.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS apprehended 1.3 million aliens in FY95, up from 1.1 million in
FY94, including 525,000 aliens in between October 1994 and November 1995 in the
San Diego sector, and 227,000 in the southern Arizona sector. About half of
those apprehended were caught at least once before.</tt><p>
<tt>A review of the mission of the inland California checkpoints, which have
come under fire regularly because of budget considerations, is now being
conducted.  The INS is now looking at a plan to open the checkpoint in San
Clemente 24 hours a day.  Over 30,000 illegal immigrants were captured at the
San Clemente checkpoint in FY 1994.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS announced at the end of December 1995 that it had deported 52,000
illegal aliens, including 32,000 criminal aliens who were finishing US jail
sentences.  These data do not include aliens who leave the US voluntarily after
being apprehended:  about 98 percent of the 1.3 million aliens apprehended
annually at the southern border, and about 90 percent of the 20,000 to 30,000
aliens apprehended at US work sites, return to their native countries
voluntarily, without formal deportation proceedings.  </tt><p>
<tt>On January 30, California Governor Pete Wilson had an illegal immigrant
delivered to an INS facility in El Centro, California to protest the refusal of
the federal government to supply sufficient federal funding for illegal
immigrants.  </tt><p>
<tt>Wilson wants the federal government to take custody of the inmate to "show
good faith" that it will pay for the 20,000 criminal illegal aliens in
California prisons.  The INS refused to accept the convicted Mexican drug
dealer, saying it is only responsible for holding aliens who are being
deported, not those serving sentences for crimes committed in the US.</tt><p>
<tt>California got $33 million in 1994-95 from the federal government to help
offset what the state claims is a $400 million annual tab for confining illegal
aliens.  About $30 million is expected in 1995-96.</tt><p>
<tt>The California State Attorney General filed documents in federal court on
January 31 claiming it could exclude illegal aliens from 23 programs ranging
from state-funded abortion to child abuse prevention.  The state is asking the
judge to rule on whether these programs can deny benefits to illegal aliens.
The programs were identified as wholly state-funded programs.  The federal
court judge ruled on November 20 that California could legally deny benefits to
undocumented immigrants under Prop. 187, if the state could prove that the
programs were wholly state funded.</tt><p>
<tt>On January 4, 1996, the INS released its report card on asylum reforms
implemented one year earlier.  The number of new asylum claims filed fell
sharply, from 122,589 in 1994 to 53,255 in 1995.  The number of cases handled
by the INS more than doubled, to 126,200.  </tt><p>
<tt>INS Commissioner Doris Meisser attributes the drop in asylum applicants to
the reforms that limit the availability of work permits and require applicants
to come in person to an INS office to learn whether their application was
accepted or rejected.  If it is rejected, the asylum applicant is placed
immediately in deportation proceedings.</tt><p>
<tt>There is a backlog of about 460,000 asylum applications, including about
250,000 so-called ABC cases filed by Central Americans, and entitled to special
consideration because of 1980s policies that denied virtually all claims from
Salvadorans.  The Salvadoran government has urged all of its nationals in the
US who can to apply for asylum under the ABC rules so that they can remain in
the US and send remittances to El Salvador (see story below).</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC4">Immigrant
Integration</a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>The Commission on Immigration Reform believes that the United States should
continue to be a country of immigration, but that the US must worry about
whether newcomers arriving today are integrating into American society.
According to the CIR, the melting pot works, in the sense that turn of the
century German and Italian immigrants become Americans committed to democratic
ideals.  The CIR endorsed "Americanization," or immigrants accepting the core
civic culture of the US, and becoming naturalized US citizens.<b></b></tt><p>
<tt><b></b>There is no single definition of Americanization, but many of those
worried about the immigrants arriving today focus on the tendency of many
recent arrivals not to speak English and not to naturalize.</tt><p>
<tt>Language in the work place, in schools, and in government has become a
flashpoint.  In San Francisco, a closely-divided federal appeals court on
October 5, 1995 struck down Arizona's<b> </b>official English law on a 6-5
vote.  </tt><p>
<tt>Arizona is one of 22 states that has made English language the language to
be used<b> </b>exclusively in conducting state business.  The Arizona case
involved a state insurance worker who challenged the law because, she said, she
had to speak Spanish to her clients, and she wanted to prepare reports in
Spanish so that clients could understand her decisions.  Her supervisor,
however, could not read Spanish.<b></b></tt><p>
<tt><b></b>The majority opinion referred to the "importance of establishing a
common bond and a common language [in a] diverse and pluralistic society," but
said<b> </b>that such a society also requires a "tradition of tolerance."
</tt><p>
<tt>California approved Prop. 63 in 1986, which called for the preservation of
English as the state's "common language," while Arizona's initiative was more
specific, requiring that state and local governments "act in English and in no
other language." </tt><p>
<tt>There is a continuing debate over how fast immigrants and their children
are learning English, and how to teach them English.  A study of immigrant
children ages five to 14 in 1980 found that, by 1990, the percentage who spoke
English well increased from 33 to 70 percent.  The USC mobility study, released
November 3, 1995, tracked immigrants who arrived in the 1970s who were counted
in both the 1980 and 1990 censuses.  </tt><p>
<tt>One central finding of the study is that non-Latino immigrants who arrived
in the 1970s learned English and increased their incomes faster than Latino
immigrants.  For example, among men 25 to 34 in 1980, the proportion of Asian
men who "spoke English well" rose from 39 percent in 1980 to 53 percent in
1990, versus 13 to 21 percent among Latino men.  The percentage of Asian men
with incomes below poverty level fell from 17 to six percent, while for
Latinos, the poverty rate fell from 21 to 18 percent.</tt><p>
<tt>The USC study defined assimilation as "adjustment, integration, and
advancement over time," and used five variables as indicators of
assimilation--English proficiency, US citizenship, occupational mobility,
average personal income, and poverty rates.</tt><p>
<tt>A study to be released in February by George Mason University professors
finds that students first taught in their own language do better than those
immersed quickly in English.  The researchers found that the most effective
program, which is also the least found in US schools, is two-way immersion
classes where English speaking students and foreign-language speaking students
learn each other's languages together. </tt><p>
<tt>Critics of the study say that it is not reflective of what goes on in
California classrooms where native-language instruction keeps students from
becoming proficient in English.  In California, there are 1.2 million students
who do not speak English.  One linguistics' professor says that if a student is
not transferred out of bilingual education by sixth or seventh grade will not
succeed academically. </tt><p>
<tt>In some areas, special schools have been established to teach immigrant
children.  In New York, a $400,000 Newcomers School in the borough of Queens,
opened to serve up to 1,000 high school students who have been in the US less
than one year.  The school plans to teach students in their own language and in
English, and to provide a variety of services to parents.  </tt><p>
<tt>There are currently 400 students from more than 40 countries enrolled in
the program.  Students are placed in classes based on their fluency in English,
not by age or nationality.  Students are taught primarily in English.</tt><p>
<tt>The theory is that immigrants have a better chance of learn English and
assimilating into American society if they first learn in an educational
setting that serves their specified needs.  Students are expected to be
enrolled in the Newcomer School for a year or longer.  </tt><p>
<tt>Critics of the program say that segregating the immigrants may stigmatize
them and that it may violate federal civil rights law.  The New York Civil
Rights Coalition recently filed a complaint with the US Department of Education
against Newcomer High because they were basing admission solely on national
origin. </tt><p>
<tt>The New York Times blasted bilingual education in New York City in an
editorial that argued that the practice of teaching foreign-born students in
their native language in all subjects, and offering only one class each day in
English, was putting such students in a "prison" from which they will find it
difficult to escape.  </tt><p>
<tt>The number of "limited English proficient" students in New York City has
almost doubled from 85,000 in 1986-87 to 154,000 in 1993-94.  The increase,
according to the editorial, came about because a bilingual education
bureaucracy that assigns students to bilingual classes even when their parents
prefer them in regular classes.</tt><p>
<tt>One University of California-Santa Barbara professor who has studied
newcomer schools says that it is uncertain how effective these type of schools
are because the students are not tracked after they leave the school.  Also,
the immigrant-only schools have high profiles and are susceptible to public
backlash.  She says that the schools should be considered transitional and that
students should not spend more than one year in them. </tt><p>
<tt>Economist Lowell Gallaway estimates that households headed by someone who
spoke poor or no English in 1989 earned $7,400 less than households headed by
someone who spoke good English.  According to Gallaway, households headed by
foreign-born persons received in 1995 on average $5,600 in federal welfare
assistance, $200 more than the average $5,400 received by US-born household
heads.</tt><p>
<tt>The bilingual education studies each vary in their findings, and that is
attributed by some to the time frame which the researchers used.  The George
Mason study had a long term time frame which spanned from elementary school to
high school.  The New York study tried to test whether its students could test
out of bilingual education within three years.  </tt><p>
<tt>One finding of the George Mason study was that students family background
was an important factor in academic success.  Students with the best-educated
parents and the most schooling before coming to the US did better than those
whose parents are not as well educated or who had little education in their
native country.  </tt><p>

</a></h2>
<tt>Over one million foreigners applied to become naturalized US citizens in
1995, up from 543,353 in 1994, 522,298 in 1993, and 342,269 in 1992.  The
number of applications for naturalization is expected to be even larger in 1996
because the 1.2 million illegal aliens who became immigrants under the SAW
program will be eligible to naturalize.  In the northwestern US, SAWs are
expected to be half or more of the applicants for naturalization.</tt><p>
<tt>Mexicans were about 30 percent of the five million foreigners recognized as
immigrants in the past five years and, historically, only 17 percent of Mexican
immigrants, but 41 percent of all immigrants, have become naturalized US
citizens.  </tt><p>
<tt>There are 2.5 to three million Mexican nationals in the US who could apply
to be US citizens.  Over half live and work in California, 11 percent are in
Texas, and 12 percent are in Florida and Arizona. </tt><p>
<tt>There is a debate among political observers about the effects of large
numbers of naturalizations on US politics. <b> </b>One view is that many
immigrants  are naturalizing to preserve their access to benefits and in
reaction to Prop. 187 in California,<b> </b>and, therefore, the most
newly-naturalized immigrants can be expected to vote Democratic.  </tt><p>
<tt>Other observers point out, however, that immigrants, especially Latino
immigrants, live in districts that are already represented by Latino or Black
Democrats, and that the effect of naturalizations is to increase the number of
votes in these districts, and perhaps to replace Blacks with Hispanics, but not
to change the party representing the district.</tt><p>
<tt>A federal appeals court in November 1995 ruled that aliens cannot be
deported from the US because of their political activities in the US.  When
seven Palestinians on student visas were arrested in 1987, the INS tried to
deport them for membership in a offshoot of the PLO, even though none of the
seven had been found guilty of a terrorist act.  The appeals court ruled that
aliens have the same rights of free speech as US citizens.</tt><p>
<tt>The State Department announced that the 1996 immigrant visa lottery will
permit up to 55,000 foreigners--almost half from Europe--to apply for US
immigrant status.  Applications for the so-called "diversity lottery" will be
accepted between February 12 and March 12, 1996 from all but 11 foreign
countries--only nationals of countries that have sent 50,000 or more immigrants
to the US over the past five years are ineligible.  </tt><p>
<tt>In 1995, some 4.5 million applications for green cards were submitted in
the lottery.</tt><p>
<tt>Many applicants are illegal aliens living in the US who want to legalize
their status.  When Mayor Giuliani announced his support for immigration on
January 30, and praised the lottery, more than 1000 immigrants who understood
that the INS was giving out greencards descended on INS offices in New York
City. </tt><p>
<tt>The upsurge in naturalization is expected to renew the debate over whether
foreign-born or US born residents are most dependent on welfare.  Under the
Senate version of welfare reform, the sponsors' income would be attributed to
immigrants applying for federal assistance for five years after arrival and, in
the case of some programs, until the immigrant had worked and paid taxes for
ten years, even if the immigrant had become a naturalized US citizen.</tt><p>
<tt>A working paper by the Bureau of Labor Statistics found that immigration
depressed the wages of US-born high school dropouts by as much as four percent
during the 1980s, accounting for about half of the decline in that group's real
wages. </tt><p>
<tt>A recent report by published in the American Journal of Public Health by
UCLA public health researchers found that immigrants are more likely to be
victims of homicide than people born in the US.  From 1969-1992, immigrants
were victims in 23 percent of homicide in the California, even though they
represent only 17 percent of the population.  Some researchers think that one
possible reason for the higher risk is that they live in areas marked by high
rates of poverty. </tt><p>
<tt>There are an estimated 2.6 million Americans living overseas, plus 600,000
military and government employees and their dependents stationed overseas.
About one million Americans live in Mexico, Canada, and the UK, and over
100,000 live in each of three other countries:  Germany, Israel, and
Italy.</tt><p>
<tt>Increasingly, US companies are using local rather than expatriate workers
to save costs.  The US State department estimates that it costs about $230,000
to station one mid-level American overseas; $60,000 for salary, $75,000 for
operating expenses, and $95,000 for overseas allowances.</tt><p>

<tt>Employers continue to criticize the US Department of Labor for proposing
changes in the H-1B program, which allows up to 65,000 "professionals" to enter
the US each year and work for up to six years.  The National Association of
Manufacturers sued DOL in April 1995 to protest changes in the regulations
governing the program, and in October 1995, DOL reissued the changed
regulations for comment.</tt><p>
<tt>NAM and other employers are protesting a regulation that requires the
development of an objective wage system for non-H-1B workers that would enable
a third party to calculate actual wages owed to H-1B workers, so that DOL can
check to determine whether H-1B workers are being paid as much as comparable
workers.  High-tech companies such as Microsoft and Motorola want to avoid
having to establish such a wage system.</tt><p>
<tt>Under the Senate immigration reform bill, S1394, employers would have to
pay a fee of 10 percent of the H-1B's annual compensation or $ 10,000,
whichever is greater, into an industry-specific training fund to prepare US
workers for the jobs that are being filled by foreigners.</tt><p>
<tt>There is a great deal of controversy over how easy to make study and work
in the US, especially for foreigners post-college education.  Many high-tech
companies argue that, since they compete in global labor markets, they need
access to the global labor market to hire the best and brightest scientists and
engineers.</tt><p>
<tt>Employers are prohibited from firing workers in order to replace them with
cheaper labor.  However, companies get around the law by out-sourcing--laying
off their own workers, and having the work done by a subcontractor who in turn,
hires foreign labor.</tt><p>
<tt>US workers at Sea-Land Services in New Jersey, for example, claim they were
fired and replaced by lower paid foreign workers from the Philippines.
Sea-Land says that laid off the US workers and switched to a subcontractor for
programming services for cost reasons.  The US workers were being paid about
$50,000 a year.</tt><p>
<tt>Colorado's ski industry has an estimated 86,000 workers for the November
through March season, and unskilled hotel, restaurant, and ski operator
workers, who typically earn $7 per hour or more, are increasingly foreigners.
Scarce and expensive housing in the resort areas may be partially to
blame--many workers live in trailers that are wall-to-wall mattresses.</tt><p>
<tt>The United States Department of Labor has certified local shortages of ski
instructors and motel janitors, allowing Colorado resorts to import workers on
temporary visas.  The estimated number of illegal aliens in Colorado has grown
to about 22,000 in 1995, up from 17,500 in 1992.  In December 1995, the INS
apprehended 45 illegal workers at 12 businesses in ski country.</tt><p>
<tt>Some critics fault ski operators for thinking more about million dollar
condos than housing for employees.  In December, 1995 there were a record 156
homes priced at $1 million or more for sale in Aspen.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC7">Alien
Smuggling</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>The January 1996 Report of the Presidential Initiative to Deter Alien
Smuggling recommended that all nations pass laws that make alien smuggling a
crime.  The report distinguished between countries of origin, transit
countries, and destination countries.</tt><p>
<tt>According to the report, smuggling fees for transport to the US range from
$200 to $300 for Central Americans to $35,000 for Chinese.  In most cases, the
alien being smuggled pays a small up-front fee, with the balance paid by
relatives already abroad once the alien reaches his destination.  Most alien
smuggling rings are ethnically-based, and many who have knowledge of smuggling
see it as a "victimless" crime.</tt><p>
<tt>The interagency task force report on alien smuggling prompted a review of
estimates of how many aliens are smuggled into the US.  Then-CIA director James
Woolsey testified in 1994 that 100,000 Chinese were illegally smuggled into the
US at a cost of $25,000 to $35,000 each, generating over $3 billion annually.
In some cases, the Chinese being smuggled to the US by so-called triads arrive
directly with false documents; in other cases, they are taken by ship to
Central America, and then come overland to the US.</tt><p>
<tt>Alien smuggling is not a crime in most of the Central American countries
through which Asians transit--many smugglers operate openly as travel agents--
so that the worst that happens to smugglers is that the aliens are taken
away.</tt><p>
<tt>The report says that alien smuggling is facilitated by "staggering levels
of official corruption."  Several Central American officials have lost their
jobs for auctioning off consulate jobs in Hong Kong and Taipei, places where
visas to visit Central American nations are distributed that allow Chinese to
leave their country by airplane for Central America.  There are believed to be
50 gangs, many based in Taiwan, that smuggle Chinese to the US.</tt><p>
<tt>Two high ranking immigration officials were fired in Uruguay after being
implicated in smuggling Chinese immigrants to Uruguay and then to Argentina,
where they were turned over to employers or pimps. The smuggling network
received about $5,000 for each person sent to Argentina.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS claims that alien smuggling has gotten so lucrative that drug
smugglers have been switching to people smuggling.  A University of Bangkok
study recently reported that alien smuggling generates $3.2 billion annually in
Thailand alone, a figure based on an estimate of the number of Thai women
smuggled to Japan, Germany and Taiwan for prostitution.</tt><p>

</a></h2>
<tt>In April 1993, about 10 percent of US residents holding Bachelor's degrees
in science and engineering, and seven percent of non-science and engineering<b>
</b>BAs<b>,</b> were foreign born, as were 23 percent of the science and
engineering<b> </b>PhDs, and 12 percent of the non- science and engineering<b>
</b>PhDs.  The share of foreign-born PhDs was highest in engineering (40
percent), math and computer science (33 percent) and physics, chemistry, and
economics (31, 26, and 24 percent).  About 55 percent of the immigrants with
PhDs in science and engineering are naturalized US citizens.</tt><p>
<tt>Most US residents with PhDs in most major fields of study were born in the
US.  Many foreign born scientists were educated abroad and immigrated after
graduation--one-third of the foreign-born PhDs in science and engineering got
their doctorates abroad, and then moved to the US to work.</tt><p>
<tt>In January, a panel convened by the National Academy of Sciences concluded
after a ten-month study that the US has too many doctors, and that the major
reason for the excess was the arrival in the US in 1993 of 23,000 doctors who
studied abroad, almost double the 12,000 foreign-trained doctors who arrived in
1988.  The US' 125 accredited medical schools graduate about 17,500 doctors
each year.</tt><p>
<tt>The number of doctors in the US has been growing --from 150 per 100,000
residents in 1970, to almost 250 per 100,000 today.  About one-fourth of the
661,000 doctors in the US were born abroad.  </tt><p>
<tt>According to some experts, the reason why more foreign-trained than
US-trained doctors are enrolled in US hospital residency programs is that the
US government pays hospitals about $150,000 for each doctor in training,
regardless of his/her nationality (MN, December 1995).  The panel recommended
reducing the number of residency slots, and giving preference to US-trained
doctors for the slots that remain.</tt><p>
<tt>According to the Institute for International Education, there are about 1.5
million students enrolled in institutions of higher education outside their
country of citizenship around the world, including 450,000 foreign students in
the US.  </tt><p>
<tt>About 60 percent of the foreign students with temporary F-visas in the US
are from Asia, and nine of the top 10 counties of origin are Asian.  According
to IIE, Japan sends more foreign students to the US than any other country,
followed by China, Taiwan, Korea, India, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Indonesia, and
Thailand.  </tt><p>
<tt>The US universities where most foreign students enroll are Boston
University, University of Southern California, University of Wisconsin, New
York University, Ohio State University, and University of Texas.  About 60
percent are male.</tt><p>
<tt>According to IIE, about two-thirds of the foreign students in the US
finance their education privately; only one-sixth receive assistance from US
institutions.  IIE reports that only 1.2 percent of the foreign students are
supported primarily by the US government, primarily through the Fulbright
scholarship program.  </tt><p>
<tt>The GAO in November 1995 released a report that said 390,000 foreign-born
students received $662 million in Pell grants (maximum $2,400 per year) in
1992-93--these students were primarily legal immigrants who can continue to
live in the US.  In California, 120,500 immigrants received Pell grants, making
them one-third of the 369,000 recipients, in New York, 96,300 immigrant
recipients were 26 percent of the 364,000 Pell recipients, and in 30,200
immigrants were 16 percent of the 188,000 Pell grant recipients in the
state.</tt><p>
<tt>The welfare reform bill pending in Congress would require immigrant
students applying for federal education aid to report the income of their
sponsors, and to assume that the student has access to the sponsors' income
when determining eligibility for federal student aid.</tt><p>
<tt>There have been more stories about the dismal job market for new PhD
students.  Budget problems at many universities and the end of mandatory
retirement has reduced the number of new job openings, and new PhDs desperate
for work have led, by some estimates, to 40 percent of US college courses being
taught by part-time faculty.</tt><p>
<tt>The San-Jose Mercury News in December 1995 published a report that accused
the California State University system of not implementing the section of Prop.
187 that requires higher education institutions to deny admission to illegal
aliens.  There are believed to be at least 1,000 illegal aliens among CSU's
325,000 students; CSU said it sent hundreds of letters to suspected illegal
alien students, many of whom claim to be California residents to pay $1970
resident rather than $8,522 in out of state annual fees.</tt><p>

</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>Maquiladoras</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a> 
</a></h2>
<tt>Mexico ran a trade surplus of $7.4 billion in 1995, versus a deficit of
$18.5 billion in 1994.  Exports were $80 billion, including $67 billion of
manufacturing goods, both from maquiladoras ($30 billion) and from
Mexican-owned factories.  Maquiladoras buy only about two percent of their
components in Mexico. </tt><p>
<tt>Maquiladoras are foreign-operated assembly plants, most along the US
border, that import components into Mexico, assemble them into products that
range from televisions to auto parts, and re-export from Mexico the finished
products--Mexican taxes are paid only on the value added by Mexican worker
assembly activities.</tt><p>
<tt>The maquiladora sector expanded in 1995 while domestic manufacturing
shrank, so that over 3,000 maquiladoras employed 743,000 workers at the end of
1995-- maquiladoras now provide about one-in-five Mexican manufacturing
jobs.</tt><p>
<tt>The value of the finished products exported from Mexican maquiladoras was
over $30 billion in 1995, or 34 percent of the total value of Mexican exports,
second only to oil.</tt><p>
<tt>The US in 1994 made a net $3.3 billion in new investment in Mexico,
including $2.4 billion in manufacturing.  About 40 percent of the new 1994
manufacturing investment was in vehicles.</tt><p>
<tt>In response to US pressures, the US has taken three steps that have the
effect of slowing the implementation of NAFTA--indefinitely postponing
cross-border trucking, shifting to a weekly measure of Mexican tomato imports,
and defining Florida winter vegetables as an "industry" so that growers there
can more easily petition for relief from injury.</tt><p>
<tt>Mexico's GDP shrank seven percent in 1995, and inflation was 53 percent.
Mexico denied rumors that it was going to raise its 15 percent value-added tax.
</tt><p>
<tt>Borrowers of up to one-third of the loans made in Mexico are not paying
interest on their loans.  Mexico has a banking crisis--money was lent for
buildings and other purposes that cannot be repaid, and the cost of rescuing
the banks could be equivalent to 12 percent of Mexican GDP (the Savings and
Loan crisis in the US cost about 3.5 percent of the GDP to clean up).</tt><p>
<tt>The Mexican government expects to phase out subsidies in 1996 that keep the
price of tortillas at about 1.10 pesos per kilogram, or about seven US cents
per pound.  Mexicans eat about 10 million tons of corn tortillas each year, or
about 200 pounds per person--these tortillas currently cost about $14 per
year.</tt><p>
<tt>In December 1994, the US and 33 other western Hemisphere nations met in
Miami for a Summit of the Americas that ended with a pledge to create a Free
Trade Area of the Americas by 2005.  Some 23 working groups have been
established to implement the summit's goals.</tt><p>
<tt>There were year-end protests in several areas of Mexico, with some rural
residents and members of the opposition Party of the Democratic Revolution
(PRD) protesting several ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI)
electoral victories in October, 1995.  For example, on January 3, 1996, police
evicted campesinos who had occupied the La Gloria ranch on the Pacific coast,
arresting about 25 PRD members.</tt><p>

<tt>December 1995 interviews with a 750-person sample of the one million
Filipinos in California find that most speak English well and want to become US
citizens as soon as possible.  Even though 85 percent of those surveyed were
born abroad, virtually all said that they speak English well, and 74 percent
were naturalized US citizens.</tt><p>
<tt>Filipinos are so well integrated in California that there is no Filipino
counterpart to Korea town or Chinatown.  Over 90 percent of those polled said
that they were happy with life in the US.</tt><p>
<tt>Some 85 percent of the Filipinos polled said that they had close ties to
the Philippines, and two-thirds reported that they sent money to the
Philippines.  Remittances are the number one source of foreign exchange for the
Philippines.</tt><p>
<tt>There were 1.4 million Filipinos counted in the 1990 Census, and their
number is expected to reach two million in the year 2000, making Filipinos the
largest Asian group in the US.  Over five percent of all immigrants to the US
since 1990--about 250,000 persons--were Filipinos.</tt><p>
<tt>Korean-Americans in Los Angeles coined the term 1.5er to refer to those
Korean-born immigrants raised in the US and caught between the first and second
generations of Koreans in America.  Most are young adults who came to the US as
children.  After the 1992 Los Angeles riots, they became active, speaking up
for their parents whose businesses suffered. </tt><p>
<tt>Many Koreans fled Los Angeles after the riots for nearby Orange County,
doubling the Korean population of around 40,000.  Los Angeles County still has
400,000 Koreans.   </tt><p>
<tt>The 1.5ers took on the tasks of helping out their community though work in
city, county and state government, health care, the legal system and politics.
Observers say the 1.5ers are full of passion and intellect.   They are
effective because they are bilingual and bisocial, bridging the gap between
Koreans and Americans. </tt><p>
<tt>In response to Congressional efforts to reduce legal and illegal
immigration, several Asian groups have formed organizations to lobby against
plans to reduce legal immigration and eliminate slots for extended family
members.</tt><p>
<tt>Asians are about four percent of the US population, but almost 40 percent
of recent immigrants.</tt><p>
<tt>Immigration reform would eliminate the 23,400 slots available each year for
the married adult children of US citizens, and the 65,000 slots for the
brothers and sisters of US citizens.  About 70 percent of the 260,000 adult
children, and of the 1.6 million the brothers and sisters, on immigration
waiting lists are Asians.</tt><p>
<tt>Many Asian immigrants are well educated, and economically successful in the
US.  About 66 percent of recent immigrants from India have a college degree or
more, as do 46 percent of recent Filipino immigrants, and 42 percent of Chinese
immigrants.  Their education and earnings, some predict, could make Asian
immigrants formidable players in US politics, as exemplified by the successful
push to permit many of the 60,000 Chinese students and their family members in
the US in 1989 to become US immigrants in 1992.</tt><p>

<tt>Salvadoran legislators urged the 187,000 Salvadorans in the United
States<b> </b>who are in the so-called ABC program, scheduled to expire January
31, 1996, to apply for asylum so that they can stay in the US.  The Salvadoran
government opened 10 offices across the US in the Fall of 1995 to help
Salvadorans apply for asylum in the US.</tt><p>
<tt>The ABC program began in 1991, when the American Baptist Church charged US
authorities with unfair treatment of political asylum requests from thousands
of Salvadorans and Guatemalans.  Salvadorans who applied for Temporary
Protected Status or asylum in the US before 1990 are covered by the ABC
settlement.</tt><p>
<tt>The Salvadoran government's aim is to "guarantee that all Salvadorans who
want to stay in the United States do so legally and continue working."  El
Salvador officials estimate that in 1994, one million Salvadorans in the United
States sent $800 million back to their country, and that the figure could reach
$900 million in 1995. </tt><p>
<tt>Applicants for asylum complete a seven-page form I-589.  Under proposed
immigration reforms, asylum applications would have to be filed within 30 days
of arriving in the US.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS on December 28, 1995 extended the Deferred Enforced Departure
status, and work authorization, of Salvadorans with ABC status who have applied
for asylum in the US, until April 30, 1996.  The INS has said there will be no
further extensions. </tt><p>
<tt>During El Salvador's civil war that ended in 1992, in which 75,000 were
killed, between 800,000 and one million Salvadorans migrated to the US.</tt><p>
<tt>El Salvador's GDP is $8 billion, and annual imports of $1.2 billion are
largely paid for with remittances--coffee, the number two export after labor,
generated $275 million in 1994.  In some regions, remittances are 60 percent of
local income.</tt><p>
<tt>Salvadoran President Armando Caldero'n Sol is trying to attract
maquiladoras to El Salvador--he says that he would like the country to become
"one big duty-free zone."  He denounced efforts to boycott retailers in the US
whose products are allegedly made under poor conditions in maquiladoras.
</tt><p>
<tt>In December 1995, US retailer Gap Inc. agreed to renew a contract with the
Taiwanese-owned Mandarin International maquila in El Salvador, if Mandarin
rehires 330 workers fired in June, 1995 for union activities.</tt><p>
<tt>Some 45,000 Guatemalans fled to southern Mexico in the 1980s to escape
fighting between the army and guerrillas, and 30,000 returned since a 1992
agreement between the Guatemalan government and guerrillas.  However, some
15,000 children--most with dual citizenship--were born in the camps, and the
Guatemalan population in southern Mexico is still 30,000.</tt><p>
<tt>Returning Guatemalans face problems, from continued fighting to the loss of
electricity to new ideas, such as using Spanish to bridge a multitude of Indian
languages.  As part of the 1992 agreement, the government has bought land for
returning farmers, but inflated land prices have raised from $2,000 to as much
as $20,000 the cost of land needed for subsistence farming.</tt><p>

<tt>France toughened its naturalization legislation in 1993 to require
foreigners born in France of foreign parents to apply for French citizenship
before reaching age 18, rather than receiving French citizenship
automatically.</tt><p>
<tt>In 1994, over half of the young foreigners 16 to 18 did not apply for
French citizenship, the first year the new law went into effect.  There were
about 80,000 foreign youth eligible to apply for citizenship in 1994, and about
41,000 did so, and 98 percent of the applications were approved.  Only 40
percent of those applying were of North African origin--most were of European
origin.</tt><p>
<tt>The purpose of the law was to promote the integration of foreign youth by
making them consciously choose French nationality.</tt><p>
<tt>The Schengen open borders group of nations is expected to be extended to
Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden in 1996.  Iceland and Norway are
not EU members and thus cannot join Schengen, but they have pledged to
cooperate with Schengen members to facilitate travel.</tt><p>
<tt>Many hope that France will remove its border controls with Schengen member
countries on March 25, 1996, the first anniversary of Schengen's border free
implementation.</tt><p>
<tt>France has led the search for EU harmonization on immigration issues,
persuading EU member nations in November 1995 that persecution by
non-government agents does not entitle a person to asylum in Europe--cynics
asserted that France did not want to offer asylum to Algerians fleeing Islamic
terrorists.  Similarly, merely belonging to a banned group, such as an
anti-cleric organization in Iran, does not entitle a person to asylum--the
individual must show that he or she was personally subject to persecution by
the government.</tt><p>
<tt>About 309,000 foreigners applied for asylum in the 15-member EU in 1994,
when 44,000 persons were recognized as refugees, including some who had applied
before 1994, and 56,000 were granted some form of temporary protected status.
Temporary protected status is expected to continue to be more common in EU
welfare states because TPS foreigners are not usually eligible for extensive
welfare benefits.</tt><p>
<tt>In the US and Canada, by contrast, there were 170,000 asylum applications,
and 23,000 foreigners were recognized as refugees.  The US received 87 percent
of the asylum applications, and made 35 percent of North America's positive
asylum decisions.</tt><p>
<tt>A RPR Gaullist work party, composed of mayors, issued a policy paper on
January 25 that recommended that tourist visas should be granted only to
foreigners who could show a return ticket upon their arrival in France, be able
to prove that they earned the equivalent of France's minimum wage, have medical
insurance, and register within 24 hours at the mayor's office.  </tt><p>
<tt>Under these conditions, many visitors to France from Eastern Europe, the
former Soviet Union, and North and West Africa would be barred.  The working
group proposed that mayors should have the right to make random inspections of
the accommodations of foreigners, refuse to issue residence certificates in
suspect cases, and demand the immediate expulsion of foreigners who violate the
conditions of their stay or present a threat to public order.</tt><p>
<tt>The Council of Europe reported on January 22 that the Paris police lock-ups
for foreigners about to be deported are substandard.  The detainees spend all
their time in cells with no opportunity for outdoor exercise. </tt><p>
<tt>The French government announced that it would henceforth recognize only one
spouse per marriage, thus ending a 1980s policy of tolerating polygamy among
African immigrants.  During the 1980s, additional wives were informally
admitted to France with the argument that immigrants were entitled to "normal"
family life.  There are an estimated 200,000 people living in polygamous
families in France.</tt><p>
<tt>Eric Raoult, the French urban policy/integration minister, announced plans
for 30 tax free zones to stimulate investment and job creation in suburban
areas with high concentrations of foreign youth.  The plans for tax exemptions
and new job creation efforts fulfill President Chirac's 1995 pledge to launch a
Marshall Plan for French suburbs, and the government has pledged about FF5
billion(about $1 billion).  The French government now spends about FF9 billion
on its urban policy.</tt><p>
<tt>According to Raoult, it is urgent that France act--more than 30 cars are
burned each evening in the suburbs of France.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC14">UK:
Deportation and Asylum</a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>Britain's decision to deport a Saudi dissident to Dominica in order to
avoid offending Saudi Arabia and jeopardizing British trade and jobs provoked a
storm of controversy in the British press.</tt><p>
<tt>The case was unusual because a British home minister explicitly said that
the reason for deporting the dissident was to preserve the trade relationship.
Since 1985, Saudi Arabia and the UK have had an oil-for-arms trade, in which BP
and Shell sell about 600,000 barrels of Saudi oil daily, and the proceeds are
used by Saudi Arabia to buy mostly British arms.  Some 400,000 people are
employed in the British defense industry.</tt><p>
<tt>A leading Dominican politician said that the deportation could cause civil
unrest on the Caribbean island and be blocked by the Parliament.</tt><p>
<tt>Britain's Trades Union Congress has joined employers in opposing the Home
Secretary's proposal to impose fines and criminal sanctions on employers who
knowingly hire illegal alien workers, arguing that sanctions will exacerbate
racism.</tt><p>
<tt>Criticism from churches and immigrant welfare groups about eliminating
welfare benefits for up to 13,000 asylum seekers persuaded the British
government to maintain benefits.  Originally planned to take effect on January
15, the new rules will not take effect until February 5, and no asylum seekers
will automatically lose benefits on that date.  </tt><p>
<tt>The government will allow continued welfare benefits for those asylum
seekers who have appealed against rejection since October.  As of February 8,
new asylum seekers who fail to make a claim as soon as they arrive on British
soil will lose their right to claim benefits. </tt><p>
<tt>The Labour Party launched a bid to block the new rules on January 23, but
they survived by a vote of  279 to 264.  </tt><p>
<tt>The new rules received support from the all-party Social Security
Committee, which says that the number of bogus asylum claims is a serious
problem.</tt><p>
<tt>The Home Office estimates that about 70 percent of all asylum claims are
made by people who enter the UK as tourists, students or businessmen.  The
British government allows 16 percent of asylum seekers "exceptional leave to
stay," usually for three years.  Prior to 1993, Britain granted asylum to about
35 percent of the applicants, but for the past several years only about four
percent have been granted asylum.</tt><p>
<tt>A British High Court judge ruled on January 19 that asylum-seekers are
entitled to have only one claim considered by immigration authorities before
being deported.  The ruling came in the case of a Nigerian student who asked
for reconsideration after his case was rejected.  The court ruled that the Home
Office did not need to consider new evidence about oppression in Nigeria, and
the fate of the student's father, who was deported to Nigeria and has not been
heard from since.  The lawyers for the student are expected to appeal.</tt><p>
<tt>On January 22, a Westminster conference entitled "London--A Safe Haven?"
examined how the government's proposed changes to immigration control, housing
entitlement and social security regulations will affect asylum seekers in the
capital.  During the conference, one Opposition MP said that the government
asylum plan is neither practical nor humane and is an "attempt to put race on
the election agenda." </tt><p>
<tt>The UN spokesperson for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees has said that
the proposed British Asylum and Immigration Bill would penalize genuine asylum
seekers.  A position paper by the UNHCR and sent to the Home Office says that
the UN recognizes and supports the efforts of governments to streamline their
procedures and to curtail abuse, but emphasizes that minimum standards of
procedural fairness must be maintained in the system from determining asylum
applications.  </tt><p>
<tt>It concludes: "UNHCR is concerned that the proposals currently before
Parliament focus on restricting access to asylum procedures in a way that may
make it just as difficult for genuine refugees to enter the process as it would
for fraudulent applicants." It goes on to warn that withdrawing welfare
benefits to many asylum seekers "would undoubtedly cause hardship to many
genuine applicants, including vulnerable individuals such as women and
children."</tt><p>
<tt>Home Secretary Michael Howard spent three days in Pakistan to talk to the
government about trying to stem the flow of Pakistanis seeking political asylum
in Britain.  More than 2,000 Pakistanis apply for asylum in Britain every year.

Asylum and
Unemployment</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>Some 127,937 foreigners requested asylum in Germany in 1995, about the same
as the 127,210 who requested asylum in 1994, but down from 322,599 in 1993 and
438,191 in 1992.  About half of 1995's asylum applications came from two
countries--ex-Yugoslavia (33,000) and Turkey (25,000).</tt><p>
<tt>German authorities processed 200,000 asylum applications in 1995, and
granted asylum to nine percent or 18,000 applicants.</tt><p>
<tt>On January 18, ten asylum seekers were killed in a suspected arson attack
on a hostel that housed asylum seekers in Luebeck, prompting German President
Herzog to assert that stronger action must be taken against anti-foreign
movements to protect foreigners living in Germany.  </tt><p>
<tt>A Lebanese resident has been arrested for setting the fire.  </tt><p>
<tt>There have been 30 foreigners killed in firebombings in Germany since 1990,
including five Turks in a 1993 fire bombing in Solingen.</tt><p>
<tt>A poll of 2,000 Germans found that crime and unemployment topped the list
of German concerns, followed by environmental concerns and the extreme right.
Fear of "too many foreigners" was ninth on the list of 22 fears.</tt><p>
<tt>Some 218,000 ethnic Germans resettled in Germany in 1995, down from 223,000
in 1994.  There were 219,000 Aussiedler in 1993, 231,600 in 1992, 222,000 in
1991, and a peak 397,000 in 1990.  Virtually all of the 1995 Aussiedler came
from the ex-USSR.</tt><p>
<tt>Since July 1990, there has been an annual quota of 225,000 ethnic Germans
per year, and those wishing to resettle in Germany must apply outside Germany.
</tt><p>
<tt>There were about 1.8 million ethnic Germans in the ex-USSR in 1991, with 46
percent in Kazakhstan, and 44 percent in Russia.  Kazakhstan, with 17 million
people and a per capita GDP estimated to be $1600 in 1993, is poorer than
Russia, which has 149 million residents, and a per capita GDP of $2,300.
</tt><p>
<tt>In addition, Kazak has been made the official language, a factor that
encourages more ethnic Germans to leave, including some who have moved to
Russia--the number of ethnic Germans in Kazakhstan has fallen from about
828,000 in 1991 to 614,000 in 1994 .</tt><p>
<tt>On January 26, Germany announced that in July 1996 it would start sending
the 320,000 Bosnians who are now tolerated in Germany to Bosnia.  The first
wave of about 200,000 people should be repatriated by about the middle of 1997.
The UNHCR said that resettlement was premature.</tt><p>
<tt>About 30,000 of the Bosnians in Germany have applied for asylum.  Most of
the rest have six-month tolerance permits, but up to 40 percent have residence
permits valid for one to two years.  </tt><p>
<tt>The Christian Social Union on January 24 called for cuts in the payments to
Bosnian refugees and asylum seekers in Germany in order to safeguard the
Germany economy.  Bosnian refugees in Germany are estimated to cost the state
and local governments between $9 billion to 12 billion per year. </tt><p>
<tt>Germany declared the fight against unemployment to be the country's top
priority in 1996, after German unemployment reached almost four million or 10
percent of the labor force in December 1995, the highest level ever recorded.
In the 15-member EU, there are about 17.5 million unemployed workers, a rate of
10.6 percent.</tt><p>
<tt>Germany's auto and steel union, IG Metall, pushed for an "Alliance for
Jobs" agreement with employers to restrain wage increases in exchange for
employers creating 330,000 new jobs.  According to government estimates, each
one percent wage increase costs German employers DM 18 billion, or $12
billion.</tt><p>
<tt>The employers group first recommended the alternative of a lower entry
level wage and more regional independence from national agreements but, with
government promises to lower payroll taxes, a tripartite deal was reached on
January 23 that will cut public spending from 50 to 40 percent of GDP and aim
to reduce unemployment by two million over the next five years.  </tt><p>
<tt>Workers who are paid less than DM 580 ($400) per month are exempt from
social security and unemployment taxes in Germany.  There are some 4.5 to six
million "580-mark jobs" in Germany, including as many as 1.5 million low-wage
jobs in private households, often filled by immigrant women.  The US, by
comparison, has about one million persons employed in the occupation of private
household help.</tt><p>
<tt>Germany had 9.4 million union members in 1995, down from a peak 12 million
in 1991.  The DGB operates on 12 percent of the dues of its 17-member unions,
and its budget will fall to DM300 million ($200 million) in 1996.  IG Metall,
with three million members, is the largest union in Germany, and one of the
largest unions in the world.</tt><p>
<tt>Union chiefs from Britain, Ireland and Germany met in Holland in
mid-January to plan a protest at Berlin's many construction sites about harsh
conditions for foreign workers.  The German construction union IG Bau estimates
that there are 30,000 unemployed German construction workers in the Berlin
area.  The German government has been unable to introduce the National Posted
Workers Directive, which would force firms to pay foreign construction workers
the same as locals.</tt><p>
<tt>A 1993 McKinsey report on productivity in manufacturing found that US
output per hour worked in 1990 was as high or higher than output per hour
worked in Germany in nine key industries, from metal working and steel, where
US and Germany output measures were equal, to beer, where German productivity
was less than half US levels.</tt><p>
<tt>The key to high productivity is designing products that are easy to
manufacture, and organizing workplaces to make products efficiently.  The
report recommended that industrial countries open their lagging manufacturing
sectors to import competition, and that they set up transplant operations
abroad in sectors with high productivity.</tt><p>
<tt>In a report said to be typical of how some medium-sized German companies
are coping with slower growth at home, German power engineering firm
Balcke-Durr bought an Indian firm to get engineers for DM 10 hourly, versus DM
130 or $90 per hour for a German engineer.  According to the company,
successful international bids for infrastructure costs must be able to do
engineering work for less than DM 50 per hour.</tt><p>
<tt>A study by the Rhineland Westphalian Institute for Economic Research
estimated that guest workers in 1991 paid about DM 30 billion($20 billion) in
taxes and insurance contributions, but claimed only DM 14 billion in
benefits.</tt><p>

<tt>Hungary, a country of 10 million, has the highest per capita income in
eastern Europe: $3,300 GDP per person per year in 1994, versus $1,100 in
neighboring Romania, with 23 million residents.  Hungary has also been
successful in attracting foreign investment--$8.5 billion since 1989.</tt><p>
<tt>One result is that there are a large numbers of Romanians working illegally
in Hungarian agriculture and construction--by some estimates, 50 percent of the
workers in these sectors are illegal aliens.  Under pressure from Hungarian
unions, the government is trying to crack down on illegal immigration, but the
crackdown is complicated by several factors, including the large informal
economy --an estimated 40 percent of Hungary's GDP is from the informal sector,
and the fact that Romanians can enter Hungary without visas and, if they find
jobs, they can usually obtain work permits.  </tt><p>
<tt>Hungary already has employer sanctions laws on the books, but they are
rarely enforced, especially in eastern Hungary.  The penalty for not obtaining
a work permit is a fine which amounts to twice the salary paid to the foreign
worker throughout the period that the employer did not have the permit.  The
fine is paid into the Hungarian Unemployment Fund.  In eastern Hungary, ethnic
Hungarians from Romania can enter fairly easily, and sometimes friends and
relatives help them to find jobs.</tt><p>
<tt>Like Germany, Hungary is trying to tackle both the underground economy and
illegal immigration.  The trick is to bring the underground economy above
board, and curb illegal immigration, without further slowing down the
economy.</tt><p>
<tt>Between 8,000 to 10,000 Chinese are in Hungary, mostly retailers operating
in 30 markets.  In Budapest, there are two major Chinese markets, one of which
has 1,000 Chinese retailers.  The cheap prices of Chinese products make them
popular with Hungarians. </tt><p>
<tt>One Chinese businessman in Hungary says that 80 percent of the Chinese
retailers working in Hungary make between $100,000 to $200,000 a year-- ten
reportedly have $2 million annual incomes.  </tt><p>
<tt>The Chinese community has 20 interest associations, established an
education foundation and opened an elementary school.  There are four Chinese
business papers in Hungary.  </tt><p>
<tt>An estimated 40,000 Chinese were in Hungary between 1989 and 1990, but the
number dropped in 1995 because of changes in visa requirements. </tt><p>
<tt>Hungary's immigration quota for 1996 is 2,000, the same as 1995.  In order
to apply for permanent residence status, a foreigner must live in Hungary
legally for at least three years.  Last year, only 118 foreigners were granted
permanent resident status. </tt><p>

<tt>Japan's unemployment rate hit its highest level on November 1995 since
1953, 3.4 percent, meaning that 3.3 million of Japan's 64 million workers are
jobless.  As one sign of the changed Japanese labor market, in 1990, there were
140 jobs available for every 100 persons seeking jobs; today, there are 60 jobs
available for each 100 applicants.</tt><p>
<tt>Japan has 3.2 million persons employed in agriculture, 14.6 million in
manufacturing, 15.5 million in services, 14.6 million in trade, and 6.8 million
in construction.</tt><p>
<tt>Despite rising unemployment and over 60,000 deportations a year, about
288,000 foreigners did not leave Japan even though their visas expired in 1995,
about the same number as in 1933, a boom year.  About 70 percent of the
apprehended foreigners had been in Japan one year or more, up from 30 percent
in 1990.</tt><p>
<tt>Most male illegal foreign workers are in construction or factory jobs and
many female illegal workers are hostesses or waitresses.  Many of the foreign
workers are used during periods when firms next extra help.  </tt><p>
<tt>For example one employer needed 10 extra workers for one day.  He pays a
broker 13,000 yen per day for each worker (about $120) and the broker pays the
illegal foreign worker 8,000 yen (about $75).  Many of the brokers are also the
foreign workers' landlords.</tt><p>
<tt>Japanese firms are beginning to restructure the way that US firms did in
the 1980s, threatening traditions such as lifetime employment and hefty
bonuses.  In Japan, wages are about 70 percent of total pay, bonuses 25
percent, and overtime five percent.  Bonuses tend to be adjusted to reflect the
firm's profitability.</tt><p>
<tt>An earthquake relief organization has written a book that details how
foreign workers are excluded in Japanese society.  The Osaka-base Foreigners
Earthquake Information Center was formed after the Kobe earthquake to help
non-Japanese speaking foreign quake victims.  </tt><p>
<tt>It recommends that Japan treat foreigners as members of the community,
rather than viewing them as temporary visitors.  The center, re-named the
Center for Multicultural Information and Assistance, is an all-volunteer
organization that assists non-Japanese speaking foreigners. </tt><p>
<tt>In Iran, two men were arrested for taking $266,000 from 45 Iranians by
promising to get them illegally into Japan.  The Iranians paid about $600 each
to be flown to Malaysia, where they were abandoned rather than given the
tourist visas for Japan that they expected.</tt><p>
<tt>A study by the National Police Agency, "Japan's Foreigner Problem and
Policies for Dealing with It," concluded that foreigners, who are nine-tenths
of one percent of the population, are 2.3 percent of the persons arrested for
criminal offenses.</tt><p>

<tt>Human resource ministers from the 18-APEC member nations approved a draft
statement January 11 that calls for sharing labor market information,
standardizing skills qualifications, and promoting the mutual recognition of
skills qualifications and easing the mobility of workers through sharing labor
market information on skills, wages and working conditions.  The conference did
not address what to with the millions of overseas workers. </tt><p>
<tt>The Philippines, host of APEC in 1996, and several other labor exporting
nations had hoped that APEC might make a general statement in support of freer
labor mobility, much as the OECD encouraged labor migration in western Europe
in the 1950s and 1960s.  This might have been expressed as pledges to share
information on job and worker availability and to protect foreign
workers.</tt><p>
<tt>However, labor importing nations fearful of massive unskilled immigration
limited the encouragement of labor migration to "qualified persons," and
Australia explained that it already facilitated such migration.  The ministers
discussed the possibility of future free flows of qualified workers.</tt><p>
<tt>The Malaysian Human Resources minister came closest to asserting the need
for an APEC-wide labor market when he said that APEC members "must be prepared
to facilitate movement of skills and workers across national boundaries."
Philippine President Ramos said that such a regional labor market "would be
more conducive both to better protection of workers and to expand opportunities
for their gainful employment."</tt><p>
<tt>There continues to be debate over whether Asia's rapid economic growth over
the past two decades was due more to one-time gains from mobilizing resources,
and thus cannot be sustained, or whether it was due to productivity increases.
Growth accounting skeptics of the "East Asian Miracle" emphasize the rapid
increases in labor and physical capital in Korea and Taiwan--they argue that
the miracle was based on perspiration, not productivity. </tt><p>

Internal Migrants</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>Are migrant workers China's answer to inequality or a threat to its
stability?  There are 70 million (Ministry of Agriculture estimate) to 100
million (media estimate) people living away from the place where they are
registered, and thus generally unable to obtain subsidized housing and
food.</tt><p>
<tt>About 70 percent of China's 1.2 billion people live in rural areas, where
household incomes average about $225 per year, versus $425 in urban areas.  An
estimated 150 million rural workers--one third of the rural labor force of 450
million--is unemployed or underemployed.  Most of China's 25 million
construction workers are migrants from the countryside.</tt><p>
<tt>Near Shenzhen, 500 migrant construction workers in December burned the
local communist party headquarters to protest police harassment.  Beginning in
1996, persons wishing to leave their registered residence for more than one
month must obtain a temporary residence permit for their destination; employers
who hire migrants who do not have such permits can be fined 1000 yuan ($120), a
relatively small fine for construction workers who earn about $150 per
month.</tt><p>
<tt>The inequality that prompts migration also fuels social tension.  According
to the World Bank, the 1978 agricultural reforms lifted 170 million Chinese
over the "absolute poverty" line, currently $43 per person per year.  But most
of those helped by the agricultural reforms were helped between 1978 and 1984;
since then, the rural poor trapped in backwater areas see only one route to
opportunity:  internal migration.  </tt><p>
<tt>If the government restricts rural-urban migration, there could be
rebellions in poor areas.  According to one Chinese analyst, economic
differences between the North and South led to the US Civil War, and he urged
the government to redirect foreign investment away from coastal areas to reduce
poverty.</tt><p>
<tt>There are reported to be three million migrant workers employed in
Shanghai, a city of 15 million at the mouth of the Yangtze River with 2,000
construction sites.  </tt><p>
<tt>At the worksites that employ local and internal migrant workers, there are
frequent clashes between employers and workers.  In the first half of 1995,
there were about 13,000 labor disputes referred to the arbitration committees
established by China's labor law, which went into effect in January 1995.
</tt><p>
<tt>Officials note that many Chinese employers fail to provide workers with
contracts, as required, so that the workers can be fired at will.  Some of the
disputes involved sexual harassment and other practices, such as having workers
kneel before supervisors as punishment.</tt><p>
<tt>Most of the investigations of labor disputes involve foreign-owned firms,
which account for 44 percent of the jobs in the Beijing area, versus 25 percent
for state-owned firms, and 31 percent for other local entities, such as
collectives.  However, over half of the job applicants in Beijing reportedly
want to work for foreign-owned firms because they pay higher wages.</tt><p>
<tt>Chinese border police captured over 7,000 Chinese who were attempting to
make illegal exits in 1995.  The police claim that they caught the majority of
people trying to leave from the coastal provinces of Fujian, Shandong and

<tt>On January 29, China announced new regulations to regulate what it says is
an annual influx of 70,000 foreign workers.  The foreign, public security,
labor and trade ministries outlined a three-step process in which foreigners
seeking jobs in China must get work permit prior to being granted work visas.
Unskilled foreign workers are banned.</tt><p>
<tt>China is preparing for the mass movement of 152 million people who return
home every year for the Lunar New Year, February 19.  The Chinese government
has urged all regional government to keep at least 60 percent of their migrant
workers in the factories before and after the Spring Festival, to help ease the
strain on transportation.  Officials and businessmen say the government
directive will be very difficult to enforce.  </tt><p>
<tt>China has demanded that Britain take responsibility of the Vietnamese boat
people because they have the responsibility to solve the problem created when
they permitted Hong Kong to become a port of first asylum 16 years ago.  The
British government says that the problem will become Hong Kong's when authority
is turned over in 1997. </tt><p>

</a></h2>
<tt>Vietnam said in January that it was ready to accept up to 9,000 of the
37,000 Vietnamese in camps in southeast Asia, including 21,000 in Hong Kong.
Vietnam takes the names of those in camps, and checks to ensure that they are
Vietnamese.</tt><p>
<tt>The UNHCR plan launched a funding appeal in Bangkok on January 14 to raise
$30 million to carry the Comprehensive Plan of Action to return the Vietnamese
in camps to Vietnam. </tt><p>
<tt>The governments of Vietnam and the Philippines have agreed to a program to
repatriate about 2,500 Vietnamese nationals housed in a refugee camp.  Starting
in March, the Philippine government will start an "orderly return program."
The UNHCR, which stopped funding the refugee camp in December, will cover the
transport costs as long as the refugees are returned without resistance.
Officials will try to convince the Vietnamese that they should not fear
retribution when they are returned to Vietnam, and should thus go voluntarily.
</tt><p>
<tt>In Malaysia, the UNHCR issued passports to about 2,000 Vietnamese illegal
immigrants housed in a Sungai Besi detention center outside Kuala Lumpur.  The
repatriation program is expected to be finished by the end of June.  </tt><p>
<tt>The Malaysian government is anxious to repatriate the boat people after a
riot on January 18.  During the riot, the refugees burned down two living
quarters. One refugee was killed, and 23 people were injured.  The incident
began after refugees refused to allow a routine police inspection of the camp.
Afterwards, the police found a cache of weapons.  This was the third riot in a
year at the camp.  </tt><p>
<tt>There are two other plans to dealing with the remaining Vietnamese.  The US
is seeking to have boat people induced to return to Vietnam, where they would
be screened by State Department and Immigration and Naturalization Service
officers charged with determining whether the returnees were likely to face
persecution.  The second proposal is that of Rep Chris Smith(R-NJ), who
persuaded the House to include funds in a bill to resettle up to 18,000
Vietnamese in America.</tt><p>
<tt>Vietnam says it will stick to its plan to repatriate 3,600 people each
month. </tt><p>
<tt>Vietnam's growth, which was about 9.5 percent in 1995, is strikingly
uneven.  In the region around Ho Chi Minh City, growth averaged about 17.5
percent from 1990-1993, but in the south central coastal area, the economy grew
only 1.7 percent.  Vietnamese economists claim the annual per capita income in
Ho Chi Minh City is $900, versus $120 in the poorer regions of the
country.</tt><p>

<tt>The number of foreign workers in Indonesia grew by 38 percent in 1995 to
57,159.  Their total salaries amounted to about $200 million.  By nationality,
South Koreans were on top, followed by Japanese, then Taiwanese.  The rise of
the number of Korean workers is attributed to an increase in Korean investment
in Indonesia. </tt><p>
<tt>Concerned about the number of foreign workers, the Indonesia government
plans to find out how many skilled Indonesians and professionals are available.
The government is also planning increased job training and employment centers.
</tt><p>
<tt>Indonesia and Malaysia have finalized the first official fee structure for
Indonesia maids working in Malaysia.  Effective January 1, RM2,000 (about $800)
is the maximum fee the 900 licensed Malaysian employment agencies can charge
Malaysian employers for a foreign maid.  The governments of Indonesia and
Malaysia hope the fee structure will stop exploitation of workers in Malaysia.

<tt>"Being sold as pigs" is how the Chinese referred to labor recruitment in
the 19th century.  Today, with Hong Kong booming, and many Chinese migrating in
search of jobs, Hong Kong is now becoming the primary destination for Chinese
migrant workers.  </tt><p>
<tt>Hong Kong has labor laws to protect foreign workers, but labor contractors
have devised ways to evade them. </tt><p>
<tt>Some sub-contractors have won construction jobs with low bids, making their
profits by paying workers less than the minimum wage.  Many workers imported
for jobs also got substandard food and accommodation.  Since many migrants
borrow money to pay the labor contractor, they put up with the abusive
conditions until the debt is repaid. </tt><p>
<tt>Some Chinese construction workers, with two-year contracts, were dismissed
early.  Hong Kong law does not allow them to seek alternative employment so
they must leave within two weeks after dismissal.  This same law applies to
maids, who have been trying to get the rule amended. </tt><p>
<tt>There is currently a government investigation into allegations that foreign
construction workers at the new Hong Kong airport are having illegal deductions
made from their wages.  On January 12, 1995, some 239 mainland workers who were
fired from airport construction jobs agreed to accept $5,000 each to end their
dispute.  The workers argued that they had  bought their jobs for about $30,000
each from a subcontractor, and should get this fee back because they were
terminated early. </tt><p>
<tt>One restaurant worker was paid only half the salary stated in the worker's
contract approved by the labor authorities.  The contractor was convicted
supplying false information on an employment contract, and given a one-month
suspended sentence and $10,000 fine.  </tt><p>
<tt>The worker had been promised $2,500 per month minus food and lodging, but
was paid only $330 per month after deductions.</tt><p>

<tt>The Philippine government persuaded the UN General Assembly to poll its
185-member nations to determine whether the UN should convene a summit meeting
on international migration in Manila.  However, most of the nations contacted
by the UN opposed a migration summit, including the 15-nation EU, which argued
that international summits are too expensive and that, in any event, there was
little basis for positive recommendations that could come out of a migration
summit.</tt><p>
<tt>In October 1995, the UN decided not to hold a migration summit, but to ask
the ILO to coordinate a meeting of UN agencies that deal with migration.</tt><p>
<tt>As of Fall, 1995, 17 countries had ratified ILO Convention 143 on the
protection of migrant workers, and five signed the UN Convention on migrant
workers.</tt><p>
<tt>The Turkish president of the International Chamber of Commerce asserted in
January that the industrial nations will eventually have to open themselves to
workers from developing nations.  According to Rahmi Koc, "if capital is
allowed to move freely...labor cannot remain static."  Free labor movement,
according to Koc, is inevitable.</tt><p>
<tt>Some believe that migration patterns in the 21st century will be different
from those of the 19th and 20th century.  In the past, it was easy for
unskilled workers to cross the Atlantic and begin anew.  In the 21st century,
the globalization of business promises to make it easier for professionals to
cross borders for temporary or permanent employment, and perhaps harder for
unskilled workers to work legally, or to settle, in the richer countries to
which they want to migrate.</tt><p>
<tt>The 30 fastest-growing "emerging economies" of Latin America, Asia, and
Eastern Europe  are expected to attract about $175 billion in private foreign
investment in 1996, about the same as 1995.  About half of this private
investment will be to Asia.  Official government and international organization
lending will provide a net $11 billion to these economies.</tt><p>

<tt>The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has started to enforce a law which says that
only foreigners earning 3,000 dirhams monthly or more ($817) and receiving free
housing, or more than 4,000 dirhams without housing, can bring a wife, sons
aged up to 18 years, and unmarried daughters into the UAE.  Foreigners earning
at least 6,000 dirhams ($1,634) monthly can employ a foreign maid as long as
they pay the government an annual fee equivalent to her annual salary-- maids
must earn at least 400 dirhams ($110) a month.</tt><p>
<tt>All foreigners working in the UAE must have a local sponsor.  The country
has eased the rules on the number of foreigners eligible to sponsor residence
visas for their families.  For the first time, foreign women professionals can
sponsor their families and housemaids.  </tt><p>
<tt>The UAE has about 2.4 million residents, of whom 75 to 80  percent are
foreigners.  Males outnumber females two to one.</tt><p>
<tt>Saudi Arabia announced that foreign workers in the kingdom transferred
SR38.1 billion in the first nine months of 1995 compared with SR 43.7 billion
in the first nine months of 1994.  The Saudi government wants to create more
employment opportunities for its college graduates, especially because of the
increase of 500,000 in labor visas given in 1995.  The number of expatriates in
the private sector has doubled in the past five years according to the
government.  There are now about 6.2 million foreigners from 190 countries in
Saudi Arabia.  Four million are employed and the remainder are dependents.
</tt><p>
<tt>Kuwait is attempted to reduce the number of foreign employees in government
from the current 46 percent to 35 percent.  The Kuwaiti government plans to do
this by returning hiring authority from individual ministries to the Employees
Diwan, the department in charge of ministry workers.  Five years ago the
Kuwaiti Cabinet decreed that foreigners should occupy only 35 percent of
government jobs, but the country has been unable to meet that goal.  </tt><p>
<tt>Bahrain has a national unemployed rate of 1.8 percent or about 4,409
people, out of an estimated work force of 239,000.  There are about 130,000
foreign workers among 550,000 residents.  </tt><p>
<tt>In January 1996, Bahrain raised its work permit fees for foreigners and the
funds raised will go to job training for nationals.  Baluchis from Pakistan and
Indians dominate Bahrain's public security force, which is responsible for
putting down anti-government protests.  </tt><p>

<tt>India and Nepal have a free migration agreement, and some one million
Nepalese live in Bombay.  There are also thousands of Bangladeshis in India,
many of whom stayed after Pakistan was partitioned in 1971.  Some Indian
politicians consider the Bangladeshis to be illegal immigrants, and want them
expelled.</tt><p>
<tt>More than 300 Bhutanese refugees demonstrated at the Indian-Nepal border on
January 24.  The Bhutanese want Indian officials to allow them to proceed to
their homeland to press for democratic reforms and early repatriation for their
countrymen living at camps in Nepal.  The protesters also demanded the release
of 150 refugees detained by Indian police in west Bengal on January 17.  They
were detained after they tried to march to Bhutan through West Bengal from
camps in Nepal.  </tt><p>
<tt>The protesting refugees had planned to travel through India and into Bhutan
to appeal to Bhutan's king to allow them back into the country.  Indian police
on January 23 erected barricades on a bridge over the Mechi River, which
divides Nepal and India, and the marchers subsequently set up camp on the
Nepalese side of the border.  </tt><p>
<tt>The refugees are staying in Nepal, where they are being assisted by the UN
High Commissioner for Refugees.  Five years ago they were allowed to travel
across India unhindered after they were evicted from their homes. </tt><p>

<tt>US Department of Labor.  1995.  BLS Projections to 2005.  Monthly Labor
Review.  Vol 118, No 11.  November.</tt><p>
<tt>This issue presents the BLS's biennial projections.  The US in 1994 had a
labor force in 1994 of 131 million; the labor force is expected to grow by 16
million to 147 million in 2005.  In 2005, about 48 percent of US workers are
expected to be women.</tt><p>
<tt>The 1994 labor force was 77 percent White (median age 38), non-Hispanic, 11
percent Black (median age 36), nine percent Hispanic (median age 34), and four
percent Asian (median age 36).  In 2005, the labor force is expected to be 74
percent White, non-Hispanic, 11 percent Black, 11 percent Hispanic, and five
percent Asian.  The number of men 25 to 54 working or looking for work is
declining slightly as some unskilled workers give up the search for
jobs.</tt><p>
<tt>Nonfarm wage and salary employment is expected to increase from 113 million
to 130 million, with 12 million of the 17 million net new jobs in services.  In
1994, four major US industries employed 83 percent of wage and salary
workers--services 31 million, wholesale and retail trade, 26 million,
government 19 million, and manufacturing, 18 million; about one in six US jobs
is in one of the ten largest counties.</tt><p>
<tt>Among the 127 million US workers assigned to occupations in 1994, there
were 23 million persons in administrative support positions, such as
secretaries, insurance processors, and reservation agents; 20 million in
service occupations, from janitors to nursing aides to private guards; 17
million professionals, from engineers to social scientists and social workers;
17 million operators and laborers, from sewing machine operators to electronics
assemblers; 14 million craft workers, from carpenters to mechanics to butchers;
14 million in marketing occupations, such as cashiers and salespersons; 13
million managers and executives, and 4 million have agricultural
occupations.</tt><p>
<tt>United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.  1995. The State of the
World's Refugees.  </tt><p>
<tt>In 1993, UNHCR assumed responsibility for 17 million people around the
world; by the beginning of 1995, that number had grown to more than 27 million,
including 14.5 million refugees, defined as persons outside their country of
citizenship and unable or unwilling to return because of political
persecution.</tt><p>
<tt>The UNHCR also counts 5.4 million "internally displaced people," refugees
within their country of citizenship.</tt><p>
<tt>Founded in 1951, UNHCR is governed by an executive committee made up of
representatives from 50 governments.  Most of its  $1.1 billion budget in 1994
came from voluntary contributions of $1.06 billion in 1994.</tt><p>
<tt>Jacobsen, David.  1995.  Rights Across Borders:  Immigration and the
Decline of Citizenship.  Available from The Johns Hopkins University Press,
800-537-5487, fax(410) 516-6998</tt><p>
<tt>The admission and exclusion of outsiders is a fundamental expression of how
a nation defines itself.  Jacobsen argues that government control over
immigration is slipping, and a growing population of foreigners and
undocumented immigrants in Western Europe and the United States is raising
questions about the meaning of national community.</tt><p>
<tt>Jacobson believes that citizenship has been increasingly devalued, as
governments extend rights to foreigners, and that international human rights
law increasingly constrains national actions on immigration.  Jacobson argues
that the ethnic basis of citizenship in Germany, versus its political basis in
the United States, have shaped each country's response to immigration
challenges.</tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC2">INS: Budget and Apprehensions Up</h2>
<tt>The Immigration and Naturalization Service announced February 8, 1996 that
much of the department's FY96 budget of $2.6 billion will be spent to prevent
illegal immigration.  The INS budget was $1.5 billion in FY93.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS will hire 500 new Border Patrol agents for the San Diego sector,
augmenting the over 1,660 agents already stationed there.  The INS will also
link its fingerprint IDENT system to its case ENFORCE system to more quickly
identify aliens previously caught.  The INS has been fingerprinting all persons
apprehended in San Diego since October 1994, and now has 550,000 fingerprints
in its computers.</tt><p>
<tt>In January 1996, apprehensions along the US-Mexican border were up 66
percent from January 1995, to 169,500.  About 40 percent of the apprehensions
were in California, 25 percent in Arizona, and 33 percent in Texas.  The
largest increase occurred in Arizona--apprehensions more than doubled between
January 1995 and January 1996. </tt><p>
<tt>According to Mexicans attempting to illegally enter the US, the cost of
being smuggled to Los Angeles is about $500, up from $200 to $300 in 1994.
Many unauthorized Mexicans hope to earn about $1,000 per month in the
US.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS will more than double the number of workplace inspectors, from 317
to 701, and target employers in garment, agriculture, and other industries
known to employ unauthorized aliens.  The program under which employers
voluntarily submit information on newly hired aliens to the INS will be
expanded from 200 to 1,000 employers in the Los Angeles area.</tt><p>
<tt>Los Angeles has already seen a sharp increase in worksite inspections.  On
February 5, the INS arrested 23 suspected illegal aliens in two clothing
factories in eastern Los Angeles, then hit a popular gathering site for day
laborers in the city of Industry.  Some aliens were apprehended as they visited
a mobile county health clinic. </tt><p>
<tt>Some critics worry that more interior inspections will lead to
discrimination against Asians and Latinos.  INS Commissioner Doris Meissner
says that the INS is emphasizing border enforcement to prevent illegal aliens
from entering the US, and targeting only employers who hire illegal aliens.
Meissner has said that interior enforcement is a vital part of the illegal
immigration issue and is "critical and importantly linked to border
enforcement."</tt><p>
<tt>The Mexican government met with top INS officials on February 21 to discuss
their concerns that increased border enforcement could lead to the use of
excessive force and abuses of the human rights of Mexicans apprehended in the
US.  </tt><p>
<tt>On February 13, 1996, President Clinton signed the executive order that
bars companies that have knowingly hired illegal aliens from receiving federal
contracts for one year.  Of the 1,029 employers fined by the INS in FY95, 576
committed paperwork violations, and 453 had knowingly hired illegal alien
workers--only the 453 employers would be affected by the new order.</tt><p>
<tt>Being fined does not automatically mean loss of a federal contract.
Instead, the INS notifies the federal agency involved with the contractor, and
the federal agency may--but does not have to-- take the INS violation into
account when it decides whether to renew a contract.</tt><p>
<tt>Many observers expect construction and food service firms working under
federal contracts to be most affected by the executive order.  On February 11,
20 illegal workers were arrested while helping to construct a new federal
office building across the street from the INS office in downtown
Atlanta.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS announced that additional funds will be made available to handle
the one million applications from aliens who applied to become US citizens in
1995.  The INS launched a CITIZENSHIP USA initiative in cities with many of the
naturalization applications, including Los Angeles and New York.</tt><p>
<tt>A poll of 412 adult Latinos in California released by the Tomas Rivera
Center, found that one-third favored more restrictions on immigration, and 40
percent supported the issuance of a national ID card to deter illegal
immigration.  Most of those polled support tough measures to deal with crime,
yet many mistrust the police.</tt><p>
<tt>A Roper poll of 1978 adults in December 1995 found that 83 percent of
respondents wanted fewer immigrants--people were asked whether the estimated
1.1 million entries in 1994--800,000 legal and 300,000 illegal-- should be
reduced.  Some 54 percent said they wanted less than 100,000 immigrants per
year.  About 20 percent of those polled wanted to stop immigration, and two
percent favored more immigration.</tt><p>
<tt>The Christian Science Monitor ran an eight-part series in February about
life on the US-Mexican border.  The second article explored the impact of
increased border enforcement on residents in eastern San Diego County.  As the
INS pushes illegal immigrants toward the remote eastern San Diego County,
residents are becoming more passionate about stopping immigration at the
border.  </tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC3">Presidential
Candidates on
Immigration</a></h2>
<tt>The surprising strength of Pat Buchanan in recent primaries will ensure
that immigration remains a key issue in 1996 presidential politics.  The
immigration issue will likely increase in importance as the Republican
presidential candidates woo California voters in the March 26 winner-take-all
primary.</tt><p>
<tt>Buchanan won the Louisiana primary, came in second to Senator Bob Dole
(R-KS) in Iowa, won the New Hampshire primary, and came in second or third in
the next three primaries.  Buchanan, campaigning in Arizona in late February,
promised to "halt the invasion" over the southern border with a fence and
troops within six months of becoming president.  Arizona's population is 20
percent Hispanic.  </tt><p>
<tt>Buchanan also promised to push for a five-year moratorium on
immigration--only spouses and children of US citizens would be admitted.
Buchanan opposes any kind of financial assistance for illegal aliens, and wants
to make English the official language of the United States.</tt><p>
<tt>Pundits noted that immigration brings together three GOP issues--crime,
illegal behavior, and welfare, and that Buchanan's rhetoric encouraged other
candidates to speak out on immigration.</tt><p>
<tt>Lamar Alexander in January 1996 in San Francisco proposed that the
Immigration and Naturalization Service be replaced with a new branch of the
armed forces to patrol America's borders.  In the same statement he said that
the federal government should pick up the tab for illegal immigrants in states
such as Florida and California. </tt><p>
<tt>Bob Dole has promised to increase the size of the US Border Patrol and
streamline deportation procedures.  Dole opposes welfare benefits for illegal
immigrants.  In an April 1995 interview, Dole said that he thought Prop. 187
was a message to Washington that the American people have reached the limits in
paying for illegal immigrants.</tt><p>
<tt>Steve Forbes, would like to increase legal immigration, and opposes the
registry concept endorsed by the CIR to deal with illegal immigration.  In July
1987, Forbes asserted that "You cannot be a great power without a large
population."  Forbes in 1995 wrote that "Legal immigrants have consistently
provided the US with energetic workers and entrepreneurs."</tt><p>
<tt>In 1985, Forbes asserted that the "The American Southwest would suffer a
depression without them  [illegal aliens]."</tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC4">Agricultural
Guest
Workers</a></h2>
<tt>In February 1995, the National Council of Agricultural Employers released a
proposal for a supplementary foreign worker program to fill temporary or
seasonal US jobs.  One year later, Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-CA) unveiled the NCAE
proposal as the "Alternative Agricultural Temporary Worker Program" or
"Temporary Agricultural Worker Amendments of 1995."  Its purpose is "to provide
a less bureaucratic alternative for the admission of temporary agricultural
workers."</tt><p>
<tt>Gallegly's proposal, to be offered as an amendment on the House floor in
March 1996, would permit growers, labor contractors, or associations wanting to
employ foreign farm workers to file at least 25 days before the job was to
begin a labor condition attestation (LCA) with their state Employment Service
office.  The House Agricultural Committee is expected to endorse the Gallegly
proposal at a hearing on March 7, 1996.</tt><p>
<tt>Employer LCAs would have to promise to pay the higher of the local
prevailing wage or the minimum wage; spell out working conditions, housing and
transportation arrangements that do not adversely affect local workers; and
promise to give preference to US workers who apply for jobs until five days
before work begins.  Local ES offices would review these LCAs "only for
completeness and obvious inaccuracies."</tt><p>
<tt>Farmers, labor contractors, or employer associations could apply for
workers, and the workers who could be employed under the program could be in
the US or abroad.   If the workers were outside the US, growers would submit
their names to INS and consulates abroad, and these named workers would be
given H-2B visas to enter the US at the consulates or at a port of entry.
Growers could recruit foreign workers anywhere and in whatever manner they
wished.  Foreign workers would have to leave the US when their jobs end or be
subject to deportation, unless another employer promises to hire them within 14
days. </tt><p>
<tt>To encourage workers to leave the US, 25 percent of the foreign workers'
wages would be placed into a federal trust fund, which foreign workers could
reclaim with interest in their country of origin.  Program costs would be
financed by contributions equivalent to social security and unemployment
insurance taxes that would not be paid by growers.</tt><p>
<tt>No one knows how many foreign workers might be requested under the Gallegly
proposal.  There are, at most, two million workers employed some time during
the year for wages on the nation's crop farms, and perhaps one million of them
work six months or more.  If 25 percent of the current farm work force consists
of unauthorized workers, and there is a one-for-one substitution between new
H-2B and unauthorized workers, then there may be 250,000 to 500,000 foreign
workers admitted under the Gallegly H-2B program each year.</tt><p>
<tt>If H-2B workers averaged $1,000 per month, then 500,000 workers employed
for an average six months would generate $3 billion in wages, of which $750
million would be withheld.  The employers who hired these workers would
contribute about nine percent of their wages to pay for the administration of
the program, or about $270 million per year.</tt><p>
<tt>The NCAE proposal is remarkable for the enormous differences between it and
the current H-2A program.  The H-2A requires farm employers wishing to employ
H-2A temporary foreign workers to take a series of steps to prove that US
workers are not available, and then to offer US and foreign workers housing at
no cost, contracts that guarantee work for at least three-fourths of the period
that the employer asserts workers are needed, and other benefits and
protections.  </tt><p>
<tt>The NCAE proposal, by contrast, extends the procedure used to admit H-1B
temporary foreign professionals to agriculture.  Under the H-1B program,
employers "attest" that they are paying prevailing wages and satisfying other
conditions so as to have no adverse effects on similar US workers, and then the
US Department of Labor relies on complaints from US workers and other employers
to investigate charges that employers are violating their attestations.</tt><p>
<tt>In February 1996, the agricultural guest worker issue is about where it was
in early 1984.  At that time, Congress was considering the legislation that
eventually became IRCA, and the major sponsors of the Simpson-Mazzoli
legislation, as well as the Reagan administration, were opposed to a special
agricultural program.  </tt><p>
<tt>In June 1984, Congress nonetheless adopted the Panetta-Morrison amendment
that would have established a free agent guest worker program for
agriculture--what the New York Times termed one of the top ten political
stories of 1984.  Then-Senator Pete Wilson (R-CA) persuaded the Senate to
approve a similar free agent program in 1985.</tt><p>
<tt>Two of the key allies of the growers in 1984-85 still influence immigration
policy.  Leon Panetta, who led the fight for the growers in the House, is
President Clinton's chief of staff, and Clinton reportedly assured California
farmers in September 1995 that "they would be taken care of" if labor shortages
developed.</tt><p>
<tt>California Governor Pete Wilson, who led the growers' fight in the Senate,
in an August 1995 session with the California Farm Bureau, asserted that he had
not changed his position since the mid-1980s.  The Wilson program would have
allowed foreign farm workers to "float" from farm to farm in the US, and
encouraged them to return to Mexico by withholding, according to Wilson,
one-third of their wages. </tt><p>
<tt>Wilson said it has been difficult to sell such a guest worker program
because of the public tendency to link illegal immigrants and guest workers.
Wilson said that, if he were President, he would expand the US Border Patrol to
reduce illegal immigration, and push to have a guest worker program
instituted.</tt><p>
<tt>The rationale for guest workers is that the labor market is not responding
properly to market signals such as rising wages, or that government
intervention is needed to prevent market adjustments that would have negative
effects, such as rising food prices.  However, if a new guest worker program
begins before any of these adjustments can be observed, it will never be known
how easily the farm labor market can adjust to changes in its labor
supply.</tt><p>
<tt>The Clinton Administration and the House Judiciary Committee oppose
Gallegly's proposal, arguing it would only lead to more illegal immigration.
Fourteen organizations, from the American Friends Service Committee to the
United Methodist Church sent a letter to House Speaker Gingrich on February 14,
1996 opposing the Gallegly's proposal, and the effort to include it in the
immigration bill without hearings on its features.</tt><p>
<tt>About 60 farm organizations, from the American Farm Bureau Federation to
the Wisconsin Christmas Tree Producers sent a letter to senators and
representatives on February 12 to urge the inclusion of the Gallegly proposal
in immigration reform legislation.</tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC5">Congress</a>Moves on Immigration
Reform</a></h2>
<tt>Congress is scheduled to debate on major reforms to US immigration law in
March 1996.</tt><p>
<tt>The Senate Judiciary Committee is scheduled to take up Sen. Alan Simpson's
(R-WY) S. 1394  bill on February 29, and the full House is expected to debate
the Immigration in the National Interest Act HR 2022 of Rep Lamar Smith (R-TX)
the week of March 18.</tt><p>
<tt>The Simpson bill would reduce the number of immigrants admitted for
employer/economic reasons from 140,000 to 90,000, and require US companies
seeking immigrants to fill vacant jobs to pay foreign workers five percent more
than the prevailing wage.  In some cases, business would also have to pay the
government a fee of $10,000 or 10 percent of the foreigner's salary, which ever
is higher, to train Americans to fill the jobs. </tt><p>
<tt>Simpson's bill also modifies the system under which US employers can have
admitted to the US non-immigrant foreign workers who temporarily fill US jobs.
The US Department of Labor says that US employer applications for H-1B workers
rose 82 percent between 1992 and 1994.  Non-immigrant foreign workers are
concentrated in California and Florida--an estimated 35 percent of the computer
programmers in Silicon Valley were born abroad.  Simpson's bill would cap the
number of foreign H-1B workers at 65,000. </tt><p>
<tt>In urging swift passage of his bill, Rep. Lamar Smith (R-TX) asserted that
"one-quarter of all federal prisoners are foreign born; ... one- quarter of
legal immigrants are on welfare."  The bill has 120 co-sponsors.</tt><p>
<tt>The Smith bill would enact new penalties for alien smuggling, build a
triple fence along 14 miles of Mexican border, streamline asylum, and authorize
another increase in the Border Patrol.  The bill would eliminate immigration
slots for adult brothers and sisters and most adult children of US citizens,
while increasing the number of wives and minor children of legal immigrants
allowed in legally each year. Legal immigration would be capped at 595,000 by
2002, down from 800,000 in 1995.</tt><p>
<tt>Businesses prefer the Smith version because it keeps the number of
immigrants admitted for employer/economic reasons at 135,000 a year, and does
not impose fees.  </tt><p>
<tt>Most observers expect Congress to approve legislation that, inter alia,
step up efforts to reduce illegal immigration by adding more Border Patrol
agents and at least experiment with a system under which employers would be
required to check whether newly-hired workers are eligible to work in the US.
The number of legal immigrants would be reduced through the elimination of
immigration slots for adult brothers and sisters of US citizens, offset in part
by more immigration slots for the immediate families of immigrants in the
US.</tt><p>
<tt>Opponents of immigration reform will first attempt to split comprehensive
immigration bills into legal and illegal components, in the hope that separate
bills can be tough on illegal immigration, but not drastically change the legal
immigration system.  Senator Simpson and Representative Smith countered efforts
to split their bills by arguing that Americans want reductions in BOTH legal
and illegal immigration.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Welfare.</u>  The Senate Immigration Subcommittee on February 6, 1996
held a hearing on Supplemental Security Income (SSI) usage by immigrants.  SSI
is a federal program that provides $25 billion annually in federal benefits
that average $325 monthly to six million poor persons who are disabled or
elderly.  Since most US residents have US work experience, they obtain benefits
from Social Security rather than SSI.</tt><p>
<tt>Under immigration law, immigrants coming to the US must prove that they
have sufficient assets, or a US resident sponsor, so that they will not become
a public charge in the US.  In many cases, the US relatives of immigrants sign
affidavits that assert that the US resident will provide support for the
immigrant so that the immigrant will not need welfare.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Elderly</u>.  However, the courts have held that these affidavits of
support are not legally binding, so that especially elderly immigrants with few
assets, and no ability to earn a US income, apply for SSI despite the
affidavits signed by their often adult children who promised to support
them.</tt><p>
<tt>In testimony February 6, 1996, a Social Security Administration official
testified that the number of noncitizens receiving SSI increased from 128,000
in 1982 to 738,000 in 1994.  In 1996, one million resident aliens are expected
to be receiving SSI payments totaling $5 billion, and they are expected to
obtain an additional $9 billion in Medicaid payments.</tt><p>
<tt>US immigration law declares that aliens who become "public charges" within
five years of entry are deportable unless the reason for their application for
welfare occurred after their arrival.  Many welfare programs have a waiting
period during which newly arrived legal immigrants are not eligible for
benefits--three years for SSI, five years for other programs.   </tt><p>
<tt>Many non-US citizens apply for benefits as soon as this waiting period is
up--25 percent of non-citizens receiving SSI applied in their fourth year in
the US.</tt><p>
<tt>Simpson's bill would extend the period in which legal immigrants could not
get SSI and other benefits from three to 10 years, which means sponsors of
immigrants would have to promise to support their relatives for 10 years after
their arrival in the US.  Immigrants who received welfare payments for 12
months or more in any 60-month period would be subject to deportation.</tt><p>
<tt>Immigrants can become US citizens after five years, so some proposals in
Congress would make aliens ineligible for benefits even if they became
naturalized US citizens.</tt><p>
<tt>The US Census reported that, in an average month of 1992, about 34 million
US residents --13 percent--were receiving benefits under one or more of seven
programs--AFDC, General Assistance, SSI, Medicaid, Food Stamps, Federal or
state rental assistance, and public housing.  In calendar years 1991-92, the
median duration of participation in these assistance programs was eight months,
and the average recipient got $436 per month from AFDC/GA, SSI, and Food
Stamps.</tt><p>
<tt>Almost two-thirds of the welfare recipients--20 million US residents--got
assistance in each of the 24 months of 1991-92.  About half of these long-term
recipients got Food Stamps.</tt><p>
<tt>It was reported that the foreign born account for eight percent of
households on public assistance and, because they tend to have larger families,
they receive 14 percent of federal benefits.  In California, foreign born
account for 21 percent of the households and receive 40 percent of the
benefits.</tt><p>
<tt>The US Census reported that about 13 percent of the nation's 4.2 million
foreign-born mothers received Food Stamps in 1993, versus 15 percent of the
31.5 million US-born mothers.  About one-fourth of all Hispanic mothers
received Food Stamps, versus 13 percent of non-Hispanic mothers.</tt><p>
<tt>In 1993, 43 percent of refugees in the US received public
assistance.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Asylum.</u>  One provision of both the House and Senate immigration
reform bills would require foreigners to apply for asylum within 30 days of
their arrival in the US.  Currently, an estimated five percent of asylum
applicants apply within 30 days of their arrival by completing an eight-page
I-589 form.</tt><p>
<tt>The Clinton Administration opposes the 30-day limit.  It argues that
reforms already undertaken--doubling the number of asylum officers who hear
claims to 325--cut the number of new asylum applications in half, to 53,000 in
1995, and 95 percent of the new claims filed are dealt with within six
months--asylum applicants must wait six months for work permits.</tt><p>
<tt>Rep. Randy Tate (R-WA) has offered a bill that would make it impossible for
any who has tried to illegally enter the US to enter as a legal immigrant.  HR
2898, the One-Strike-You're-Out Immigration Act of 1996, has been embraced by
FAIR, which says that it would give aliens a good reason not to try to enter
illegally or overstay their visa. </tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC6">Unions
and
Immigrants</a></h2>
<tt>The AFL-CIO met in New York in late October, 1995, and selected John Sweeny
of the 1.1 million-member Service Employees International Union to head the 13
million member AFL-CIO.  The US had 16.4 million union members in 1995, and
union members were 15 percent of the labor force.</tt><p>
<tt>Sweeny has made union organizing a high priority.  About 35 percent of US
nonfarm workers were union members in 1955, 24 percent in 1979, and 16 percent
in 1995.  </tt><p>
<tt>The AFL-CIO pledged to spend $100 million on union organizing in 1996-97,
and announced a program under which the AFL-CIO would provide $1 for every $4
that its 78-member unions spend on organizing.  The AFL-CIO also welcomed back
into the federation the 117,000 National Health and Human Service Employees
Union, one of the most aggressive organizers, with 15 full-time
organizers.</tt><p>
<tt>The number of strikes involving 1,000 or more workers fell to 32 in 1995,
the lowest number in 50 years, and far below the 400 per year of the early
1950s and late 1960s.  The average duration of strikes has risen to an all-time
high of 53 days.</tt><p>
<tt>Several cities and unions are spearheading the organizing campaign.
Sweeny's SEIU reportedly spends 30 percent of its budget on organizing, has
organizers who speak 14 languages, and publishes information in a number of
Latin America and Asian languages.  The SEIU's organizing drives among janitors
and health care aides at the end of the 20th century are sometimes compared to
the efforts of manufacturing unions to organize factory workers at the
beginning of the century.</tt><p>
<tt>The SEIU is targeting health care workers; in many US cities, hospitals are
the largest private employers, and the US health care industry employs nine
million workers, half as many as US factories.  In California, the SEIU is
trying to organize the 160,000 home health care aides who, as independent
contractors, assist about 190,000 persons who live at home.  </tt><p>
<tt>The home health care aides have work<b> </b>contracts with the disabled
person whom they assist--the disabled person is their supervisor who signs
their time sheet.  The aides are paid $4.25 per hour and receive no benefits or
labor law protections.  The SEIU has dues of $7.38 per month deducted from the
$300 to $400 that most home health care aides earn.<b></b></tt><p>
<tt><b></b>The unions that represent workers in sewing shops, who are often
immigrants, merged in the summer of 1995 in UNITE--Union of Needletrades,
Industrial, and Textile Employees, a 300,000-member union headed by Jay Mazur.
UNITE runs an immigration assistance center and provides language classes for
members.</tt><p>
<tt>In Texas, most of the small-town garment shops that employed primarily
part-time women to sew garments have closed, with owners and workers blaming
everything from free trade and NAFTA to the failure of the US Department of
Labor to stamp out urban garment sweatshops.  The number of apparel jobs in the
US fell to 846,000 in 1995, down more than 10 percent from 945,000 in 1994.
Half of the apparel sold in the US is imported.</tt><p>
<tt>However, many of the unions that immigrants are most likely to come in
contact with have been charged with corruption.  The Laborers International
Union of North America, the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees
International; the International Longshoremen's Association, and the
International Brotherhood of Teamsters have been charged with being
corrupt.</tt><p>
<tt>Los Angeles leads the list of cities in which many unions see new
members--only about 16 percent of the Los Angeles labor force belongs to
unions, versus 27 percent in New York City, and 24 percent in Detroit.  Instead
of organizing workers company-by-company, unions hope to use community-based
organizing--work with churches and other trusted institutions to make immigrant
workers aware of unions.  Los Angeles is considered ripe because although it
depends heavily on immigrant workers, who despite former reluctance to join
unions, are now receptive to organized labor. </tt><p>
<tt>On February 20, the AFL-CIO unveiled its new $35-million Reclaim America
campaign to get out the vote and to spur voters' support for issues important
to organized labor.  Most of the funds will be collected through a special 15
cent per member assessment that is expected to be approved at a special union
convention scheduled for March 25.   </tt><p>
<tt>Unions are leading a drive to increase the minimum wage state by state.
The federal minimum wage was last raised in 1991, to $4.25 per hour, although
some states, including California raised their minimum wages earlier.  Today,
about 20 percent of the states have minimum wages higher than $4.25--New
Jersey, at $5.05 is the highest.  </tt><p>
<tt>Despite President Clinton's call for a $5.15 minimum wage, the Republican
controlled Congress is unlikely to act.  Thus, unions and other supporters of a
minimum wage hike are gathering signatures to put initiatives on the ballots in
seven states, including California and Washington, that would raise the minimum
wage.  The California initiative, for example, would raise the state's minimum
wage from $4.25 to $5 in March 1997, and $5.75 in March 1998.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC7">Canada
Cracks Down on Immigrant
Sponsors</a></h2>
<tt>The Canadian government on December 14, 1995 promised to crack down on
residents<b> </b>who, after sponsoring the immigration of their relatives to
Canada, fail to provide for them.  Canadian residents are allowed to sponsor a
spouse, fianc&eacute;, dependent children, parents and grandparents for
immigration to Canada.  </tt><p>
<tt>New rules prevent residents from sponsoring immigrants if the Canadian
resident has received social assistance in the previous 12 months, is in
prison, or is facing trial on charges that could lead to deportation.</tt><p>
<tt>The metropolitan Vancouver area, with 1.8 million residents, is home to
300,000 people of Asian origin.  In communities such as Richmond, Asians are 30
percent of the population.  Most of the Asian immigrants are from Hong Kong and
Taiwan, and have been attracted to Canada by an immigration policy that favors
wealthy immigrants with investment funds.  </tt><p>
<tt>About 50 percent of the 57,000 students in Vancouver's public schools list
English as their second language.</tt><p>
<tt>According to a recent survey by Statistics Canada, immigrants from Hong
Kong invested about $6.5 billion in Canada between 1987 and 1991.  British
Columbia benefited from a tripling of direct investments from Asian countries
and the Pacific Rim is now the major source of foreign investment over the US
and the European Union.</tt><p>
<tt>As 1997 approaches, more Hong Kong residents are expected to move to
Canada.  The number of immigrants settling in British Columbia quadrupled
between 1986 and 1994, and the percentage of Asians among these immigrants rose
from 37 percent to 68 percent. </tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC8">Mexico</a>Steps Up Southern Border Enforcement</a></h2>
<tt>Mexico stepped up enforcement on its southern border with Guatemala,
arresting an average 300 Central Americans and Asians per day at immigration
checkpoints in late January, double the number in 1995.  Central Americans who
fail to make it across the border are reportedly turning Tecun Uman, a
Guatemalan city of 20,000, into a staging area with more than 20,000
transients, coyotes and guides.</tt><p>
<tt>Getting illegally into Mexico is a lot easier than getting into the
US--usually only a quick trip on a homemade raft across the Suchiate River.
But once inside Mexico, non-Mexicans headed for the US reportedly suffer abuse
at the hands of the police and criminal gangs.  According to one priest: "There
are more human-rights violations here [Mexico] in one day than there are in a
year in the United States."</tt><p>
<tt>According to a regional Mexican official, border apprehensions have jumped
from 150 a day in January, 1995 to 250 a day in January 1996.  The Mexican
government claims that any military build-up at the border is for national
defense.  </tt><p>
<tt>In mid-February, leaders of the so-called Zapatista rebellion who took over
government offices in Chiapas January 1, 1994 agreed to sign an accord with the
Mexican government that spells out the rights of the 10 million Indians in
Mexico.  The agreement recognizes the right of Indians to "autonomy," which
means, inter alia, that Indians can use traditional forms of government in
their communities, and run for office without being members of a formal
political party.</tt><p>
<tt>Mexico's economy shrank by almost seven percent in 1995, and most
forecasters expect two to three percent growth in 1996.</tt><p>
<tt>Mexico is considering ending tortilla subsidies, which cost 8.5 billion
pesos ($1.2 billion) in 1995, as Conasupo paid farmers high prices for corn,
and sold the corn at lower prices than it paid to tortilla makers.  One
company, Maseca or Mission Foods in the US, reportedly receives most of these
subsidies.  It allegedly used its close ties to the government to force a
switch in the way tortillas are made.  Instead of boiling corn kernels in water
and lime, and then grinding the pulp into dough (nixtamal), Maseca supplies
tortilla makers with corn flour.</tt><p>
<tt>The tortilla subsidies benefit mostly urban Mexican residents who can buy
subsidized tortillas.  Mexico's rural poor usually do not buy ready-made
tortillas.</tt><p>
<tt>Mexicans returning home from the US for the holidays in December reported
many encounters with bandits who robbed them and stole their cars.  This,
despite a program that increased federal patrols along north-south highways
traveled by tourists.  For years, Mexicans have been victims of bandits, and
they claim they are getting no police assistance because of corruption.
</tt><p>
<tt>The Teamsters Union began running radio ads in January 1996 that urged the
US to maintain the ban on Mexican trucks delivering goods in border states.
Cross-border trucking was scheduled to go into effect under NAFTA on December
18, but was delayed indefinitely by the US.  </tt><p>
<tt>Mexico says it is prepared to permit US trucks into Mexico, as NAFTA
stipulates, but most US experts expect the trucking ban to remain in place
until after the November 1996 US election.  US companies have complained that
Mexico is not letting them invest in Mexican trucking companies, as NAFTA
stipulates.  Under NAFTA, US companies can own up to 49 percent of Mexican
trucking companies that specialize in international transport--domestic
cabotage, or movements of goods within Mexico, remains off limits to foreign
investment.</tt><p>
<tt>The Clinton administration reportedly considered not certifying Mexico as a
country making sufficient progress to stop drug smuggling.  The US Foreign
Assistance Act requires the president to announce by March 1 of each year which
nations will  be officially listed, or certified, as cooperating in the effort
to halt drug trafficking.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC9">Argentina</a>Beefs Up Employer
Sanctions</a></h2>
<tt>The Argentine government proposed to increase fines to $100,000, and jail
terms of up to six years, for employers who hire illegal foreign
workers.</tt><p>
<tt>There are 800,000 to one million foreigners working illegally in Argentina.
Most are from neighboring countries, including perhaps 500,000 Bolivians, and
foreign workers are maids, construction, or agricultural workers.  </tt><p>
<tt>Argentina has a 16 percent unemployment rate, and many experts believe that
the government is scapegoating immigrants.  Some note that only four percent of
the residents of greater Buenos Aires are foreigners, but 20 percent are
internal migrants desperate for jobs.  Many employers prefer to hire workers
who will work outside the social security system--up to one third of
Argentina's employment is outside the social security system. </tt><p>

Immigration</a></h2>
<tt>On January 31, 1996 the last 124 Cubans left the US base at Guantanamo for
the US.  After Cubans and Haitians set out for the US in the summer of 1994,
the US erected a tent city at Guantanamo, on the eastern tip of Cuba, to house
some 29,000 Cubans and 21,000 Haitians who were picked up by the US Coast Guard
at sea in Operation Sea Signal.  Most of the Haitians were sent home, and most
of the Cubans came to the US.  </tt><p>
<tt>The Guantanamo base maintains materials to house up to 10,000 people in
future emergencies.</tt><p>
<tt>The Cuban exodus was halted by a US-Cuban agreement that guaranteed Cubans
at least 20,000 immigration visas annually, provided Cubans applied in
Havana--although the US reported in February 1996 that 280 Cubans have been
intercepted since May 1995 attempting to flee the island on small boats, or to
enter the Guantanamo base.  The Haitian exodus halted after President Aristide
was returned to power, and the US stood firm on its policy of not admitting
Haitians to the US.</tt><p>
<tt>Under an agreement with Cuba, the Bahamas will return Cuban boat people and
Cuba will accept them.  More than 30,000 Cubans who are detained or living in
the Bahamas will be returned.  The conditions and a timeline for the returned
have not be released.  Some of the Haitians and Cubans in the Bahamas were
employed as low-wage farm workers while there.</tt><p>
<tt>Cuban President Fidel Castro agreed to lower, in some needy cases, the fee
Cubans are charged for migrating to the US.  Castro agreed to lower fees for
1,000 cases immediately and an additional 1,000 cases each year.  The fees will
be lowered from $600 to $300 dollars.  The migration fees have meant that it
costs up to $900, including airfare to emigrate to the US.</tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC12">EU:
 Schengen and
Asylum</a></h2>
<tt>A summit aimed at getting France to implement the Schengen agreement's open
borders clause scheduled for March 7, 1996 was postponed after a French-Dutch
dispute over drugs--the French opposed the Dutch policy of allowing up to 30
grams of marijuana to be sold in 300 coffee shops.  </tt><p>
<tt>In another blow to Schengen, Spain suspended its participation in the
extradition treaty after Belgium freed two alleged Basque terrorists.  The
Schengen agreement came into force among six EU nations in March 1995.
Currently, only Germany, Portugal, Luxembourg and the Netherlands are operating
a full open borders policy with other Schengen nations.  </tt><p>
<tt>The number of requests for asylum in Europe in 1995 declined.  The decrease
has been gradual since 1992, when there was a record 674,000 requests, compared
to only 305,000 in 1994.</tt><p>
<tt>Britain in the only country in Europe where the number of asylum
applications is still rising.  There were 44,000 asylum applications in Britain
in 1995, up 12,000 from 1994. </tt><p>
<tt>The EU in February 1996 postponed plans to make occupational pensions
portable, citing interference with member nations' pension programs.
Government-run pension programs are already coordinated, but not
employer-provided supplements, which often exceed government pensions.</tt><p>
<tt>Germany is considered the major obstacle to EU-wide employer pensions.  To
promote loyalty to a firm, Germany "vests" or makes portable pension benefits
only after 10 years of employment.  This discourages worker mobility.</tt><p>
<tt>Germany argues that there is no need to reduce the vesting period to five
years because only two percent of the EU's workers are nationals of one country
employed in another.  Critics counter that it is precisely because of pension
rules such as Germany's that there are so few intra-EU migrant workers.</tt><p>

<tt>The interior ministers of Germany's 16 states met January 26, 1996 and
agreed to begin to return the 320,000 Bosnians in Germany to Bosnia on July 1,
1996.  Bosnians without families in Germany are expected to leave by June 30,
1997; other Bosnians are expected to be out of Germany by August 31, 1997.
Most of the 70,000 Croatians who fled to Germany have returned.</tt><p>
<tt>Under German law, the 16 interior ministers have considerable discretion in
arranging for the return of Bosnians.</tt><p>
<tt>There were 12,050 asylum applications in Germany in January 1996, including
2,400 each from the ex-Yugoslavia and Turkey.  Germany changed its asylum law
and procedures on July 1, 1993, and the number of foreigners applying for
asylum in Germany was about 127,000 in 1994 and 1995, down sharply from 322,
599 in 1993 and 430,191 in 1992.</tt><p>
<tt>The chairman of the opposition Social Democrat (SPD), Oskar Lafontaine, was
criticized by the ruling government parties for suggesting in the run-up to
state elections in Baden-Wuerttemberg, Rhineland-Palatinate, and
Schleswig-Holstein on March 26 that ethnic Germans were overburdening the
German job market and welfare system.  According to Lafontaine, "A million
people have come as job-seekers and it's about time to stop this influx,
otherwise we'll have 100,000 more unemployed at the end of the year."</tt><p>
<tt>About two million ethnic Germans have emigrated from the former East Bloc
to Germany since 1989, and four million ethnic Germans still live in eastern
Europe and the former Soviet Union.  In 1995, some 217,898 ethnic Germans
arrived in Germany, down from 222,591 in 1994.  Some 100,000 Germans in eastern
Europe have valid  immigration documents that would permit them to move to
Germany.</tt><p>
<tt>The German Parliament on February 9 approved laws aimed at reducing the
number of foreign workers on German construction sites.  The new laws will
enforce minimum wage and social security payments for all employees effective
March 1, 1996.  Companies found violating the new law could be blacklisted from
public works contracts.  </tt><p>
<tt>Some construction supervisors predict that the new law will force thousands
of foreign construction workers into the black economy--one German employer
noted that the total costs of hiring an illegal foreign worker can be as little
as 5 DM per hour, versus 60 DM to 80 DM per hour for a German.  On February 14,
1996, German authorities inspected a major construction site in Berlin, taking
away some of the foreign workers for questioning, and promising more
raids.</tt><p>
<tt>At most construction sites, the foreman is German, the skilled workers are
British and Irish, the hod-carriers are Portuguese, and the laborers are Poles.
</tt><p>
<tt>European Union officials believe that there is enough support, despite
British opposition, to pass an EU law ensuring that EU workers seeking
employment in other EU nations receive the same pay and conditions as local
employees as of the first day they are employed abroad.  The four year old
proposal is getting a new look because of complaints of "social dumping" in
German construction.</tt><p>
<tt>Under the EU's freedom of services proviso, the company leasing the
low-cost workers is providing a cross-border service to the firm that actually
employs the worker.  France, the Benelux, and now Germany have national laws
that require such "seconded" workers to be paid at least the local minimum wage
from their first day of work--some EU countries want a one to three month
period during which workers from other EU nations can be paid less.</tt><p>
<tt>Under EU voting procedures, Britain must have the support of two other
large countries to veto the proposed regulations.</tt><p>
<tt>On January 30, 1996, Germany announced a 50-point plan to stimulate
investment and create jobs.  Germany in January 1996 had 35 million employed
and 4.2 million unemployed workers--10.8 percent of the labor force was
jobless, and one-fourth of those without jobs are 55 or older.  To persuade
long-term unemployed workers to accept jobs, assistance payments will be
reduced for each year of joblessness.</tt><p>
<tt>Many companies reportedly lay off older workers so that they can push the
cost of older workers onto the government--laying off a worker over 55 costs
the German unemployment/welfare systems an average $150,000, of which the
employer pays less than 10 percent.  German workers are eligible to draw state
pensions at age 58.</tt><p>
<tt>There is a great deal of debate over how to create jobs and reduce
joblessness.  One issue is termination.  In the US, a worker who is permanently
laid off when a plant shuts typically gets one week of severance pay for each
year of employment--in Germany, the ratio is one month's pay for each year of
employment, or four times more.</tt><p>
<tt>When a firm lays off 10 percent or more of its workers, the employer must
work out a social plan with the plant's workers' council-- a group of elected
workers--and an interest reconciliation, which means that a company closing a
plant must try to sell the plant to another buyer to preserve jobs, or give the
workers a chance to buy it.</tt><p>
<tt>According to some US companies operating in Germany, the cost of "bribing"
workers to agree to job cuts discourages US and other foreign investment in
Germany.  </tt><p>
<tt>Many employers want Germany to permit five-year and other limited-term
contracts, which would enable employers to dismiss workers after a fixed period
without giving a reason or paying severance.  Under German law, employers and
workers can agree to one maximum 18 month contract--employers want 24 month
contracts that could be renewed.  About six percent of West Germany's workers,
and 12 percent of the East's workers, are on fixed time contracts.</tt><p>
<tt>Most Germans reject labor market deregulation that, they argue, might
create a class of so-called working poor residents in low-wage jobs.</tt><p>
<tt>There were 226,000 foreigner-owned businesses in Germany in 1993, almost
double the number in 1988.  Half of these foreigner-owned businesses were
restaurants, and Turks owned about one in six foreign-owned businesses.</tt><p>
<tt>Some four million Germans are receiving social assistance--about one-third
of them are long-term unemployed.  Poverty in Germany is defined as an income
of less than half the average income of all households.</tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC14">Britain</a>More Safe
Countries</a></h2>
<tt>The controversial Asylum and Immigration Bill passed 280 to 250 on February
22, 1996 in the House of Commons.  The bill will now be considered by the House
of Lords.  Britain may add to its "white list" of nations deemed safe from
political persecution Ethiopia, Tanzania and Kenya--some 3,000 nationals of
these countries applied for asylum in the UK in 1995.  </tt><p>
<tt>The current list of safe countries includes Bulgaria, Cyprus, India, Ghana,
Pakistan, Poland and Romania.  Nationals of safe countries can apply for asylum
in the UK, but the burden of proof is on them to show that, contrary to the
general absence of political persecution, in this case, the applicant was
persecuted.</tt><p>
<tt>New regulations went into effect on February 5, 1996 that require
applicants for asylum to apply at the port of  entry if they want to obtain
welfare benefits.  Applicants whose claims are rejected are not allowed to
collect benefits during the appeal. </tt><p>
<tt>However, posters in English, Turkish, French and Spanish warning refugees
at Heathrow Airport that they must immediately register or risk being deported
have been banned by the British Airports Authority as "too political."</tt><p>
<tt>A judge prevented the implementation of the welfare ban--there will now be
a trial on its legality.  Another court will decide in mid-February whether the
British government should be prevented from enforcing the regulations.  The
government argues that the burden of proof is on asylum applicants to prove
that they deserve refugee status and welfare benefits.</tt><p>
<tt>In a related ruling, a Court of Appeal ruled that the Westminster housing
authority is under a statutory duty to house nationals from other EU countries
who entered the UK lawfully to work, have not been told to leave, and who are
now unemployed and homeless.  The ruling is expected to be appealed to the
House of Lords. </tt><p>
<tt>Saudi dissident Mohammed al-Masari argued before an immigration appeals
court on February 23, 1996 that his life would be in greater risk in Dominica,
where the British government plans to deport him, than in Britain.  </tt><p>
<tt>The island nation of Dominica has acknowledged that it agreed to accept the
Saudi dissident in exchange for financial aid and a guaranteed market for its
bananas.  </tt><p>
<tt>The number of British unions has fallen from about 500 in the mid-1970s to
250 in 1995, and the number of union members fell from a peak 13.5 million in
1979 to about nine million today.  Unions are strongest in Britain's public
sector--62 percent of public employees in the UK are union members, versus 23
percent of private employees.</tt><p>
<tt>The Conservatives, who have governed the UK since 1979, enacted laws that
e.g., required secret postal ballots before unions could call strikes, outlawed
secondary strikes in one company to put pressure on another company, and ended
closed shops, which required workers to be union members before working in
certain workplaces.  These laws are likely to remain in place if Labour comes
to power in the next election, but British unions hope that a new government,
plus EU labor legislation, will require employers to formally adopt workplace
representation plans.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC15">Spain</a>'s Grand Bargain</a></h2>
<tt>Spain announced new measures on February 1 to crack down on illegal aliens
in the country, and to make it harder for non-EU visitors to get visas to enter
Spain.</tt><p>
<tt>At the same time, Spain announced a plan to permit aliens who have spent at
least six years in the country on temporary permits to become permanent
residents, a liberalization pushed by unions and immigrant rights
groups.</tt><p>
<tt>About one third of the 500,000 immigrants residing in Spain will be
eligible for permanent-resident status, which allows them to have their
children join them in Spain.</tt><p>
<tt>Spanish police announced on October 16 that they had broken up a network of
Chinese restaurant owners who illegally smuggled 100 Chinese immigrants into
the country over the past four years.<b></b></tt><p>
<tt><b></b>The immigrants were flown to Moscow, taken by train to Prague,
smuggled across the border from the Czech Republic into Germany, and then taken
to Spain.  The illegal Chinese immigrants would work in restaurants, garment
factories or in prostitution in conditions of semi-slavery.</tt><p>
<tt>Thousands of illegal immigrants arrive in Spain each year, paying up to
2,000 pounds for a trip from Africa to the southernmost point in Europe, the
beach of Tarifa in Spain.  Officials estimate the number of aliens arriving on
Spain's southern shores at about 50,000 in 1995. </tt><p>
<tt>Once an illegal immigrant lands on Spanish soil, he cannot be sent them
back to Morocco, because that country refuses boat people who may have embarked
from there.  Many of the aliens live in tents or hostels, where they are free

<a name="RTFToC16">Italy</a>:
Immigration Decree Not Enough</a></h2>
<tt>The Interior minister who issued Italy's immigration decree that called for
the immediate expulsion of illegal immigrants in early February called the
decree inadequate.  </tt><p>
<tt>Under the November 19, 1995 decree, illegal immigrants accused of a crime
can be deported immediately, while other illegal immigrants are served with
expulsion orders that give them 10 days to leave.  Immigrants allegedly use
these 10 days to disappear, or to begin endless appeals.</tt><p>
<tt>Since the new decree was issued, about 2,000 expulsion orders were issued,
but, according to the ex-minister, probably no aliens were expelled.  In 1995,
about 56,000 expulsion orders were issued, and 7,400 aliens were
expelled.</tt><p>
<tt>The Italian government can re-issue the decree, or the Parliament can enact
it into law.  The failure of the Parliament to act is the explanation offered
for why only 74,400 illegal aliens regularized their status since November 19,
1995, when aliens who made social security payments and got letters from their
employers could become legal immigrants. </tt><p>
<tt>On February 3, between 10,000 to 30,000 immigrants demonstrated in Rome
against racism and called for the withdrawal of the November decree.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC17">Czech
Republic Faces Labor
Shortages</a></h2>
<tt>A very low unemployment rate is slowing down the expansion of the free
market system in the Czech Republic.  Employees are constantly being wooed away
to higher-paying jobs, leading to high job turnover. </tt><p>
<tt>There are currently about 27,000 Ukrainians illegally employed in the Czech
Republic, Ukrainians rank second behind Slovaks.  Czech businesses have said
that once the Czech Republic completes its restructuring, it will turn to the
Ukraine for guest workers.  </tt><p>
<tt>The Czech Republic and the Ukraine already have a guest worker agreement.
In addition to a 12-month pass, the Czech government will introduce three- and
six-month permits for seasonal workers, and project-specific permits for
employees of Ukrainian firms contracted for jobs in the Czech Republic.
</tt><p>
<tt>The Czech Republic is considering a change in its citizenship law to remove
the requirement that applicants for naturalization have a clean criminal record
for five years.</tt><p>
<tt>The Council of Europe and Helsinki Commission criticized Czech citizenship
law on February 21 for causing thousands of residents who previously held
Czechoslovak citizenship to become "aliens."  Slovakians are considered
foreigners in the new Czech Republic, and many Slovak Romanies living in the
Czech Republic are unable to acquire Czech citizenship because they have
criminal records.  </tt><p>
<tt>Many of the Slovakians were labeled criminals by the Czech Republic because
they had a police file--though the Czech government admits that a police file
did not mean a person collaborated with the secret police.  The citizenship law
bans from public office everyone registered in the secret police files,
regardless of whether they worked for or cooperated with the secret police.
</tt><p>
<tt>An opinion poll by the state-funded Institute for Public Opinion Research
of 1,022 Czechs found that about one-third do not like other races,
particularly Gypsies, Germans, and Vietnamese.  More than one quarter of the
respondents thought that there should be stricter laws on foreigners visiting
and conducting business in the Czech Republic.  </tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC19">Thailand Proposes Guest Workers</a></h2>
<tt>Thailand's interior ministry has proposed a plan to permit employers in 35
of the country's 76 provinces to import foreign workers.  The provinces in
which foreign workers would be allowed include Bangkok, the border regions, and
coastal provinces.</tt><p>
<tt>If approved by the labor ministry and the cabinet, employers would register
their foreign workers by paying a Baht 5,000 ($200) deposit per worker, and a
Baht 1,000 per worker fee.  Foreign workers would have to be paid the Thai
minimum wage.  There are an estimated 500,000 to 700,000 mostly illegal foreign
workers in Thailand.</tt><p>
<tt>A pilot program involving deposits and fees failed because many foreign
workers disappeared, so their employers forfeited their deposits.</tt><p>
<tt>Some in the government proposed to allow illegal immigrants already in the
country to register for work with the Employment Division, but the Thai
employment department director countered that illegal foreign workers should be
allowed to work only in provinces with acute labor shortages.</tt><p>
<tt>Under the recommended plan, illegal immigrants would report to the
immigration police, and then be registered by the labor ministry prior to legal
employment.  Work permits would be valid for two years, and could be extended.
</tt><p>
<tt>Employers must register each foreign worker with the employment department,
and pay a 5,000 baht guarantee.  Employers caught with illegal workers could
face up to three years in jail or a fine of not exceeding 60,000 baht or both.
Each employer will be allowed to have a maximum half of his work force consist
of registered foreign workers. </tt><p>
<tt>The Thai government estimates that there at least 330,000 Burmese, 100,000
Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi, 100,000 Chinese, and more than 10,000 Khmer
or Laotian workers in the country.  Brokers are paid between 3,000 to 5,000
baht for each migrant they bring to factories in Bangkok.</tt><p>
<tt>Several Thai labor councils have objected to the foreign workers plan
because it could mean fewer job opportunities for native workers.  One member
of Parliament suggested the foreign workers be restricted to industries that
Thais avoid, such as fisheries and pig and chicken farms. </tt><p>
<tt>The Labour and Social Welfare Ministry has agreed to expand from nine to 22
the provinces who will be allowed to recruit foreign workers for fishing.
Before trawler owners may legally hire foreign workers, the Fisheries
Department must amend the Fishing Rights Act.  </tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC20">Indonesian
Workers in Malaysia</a></h2>
<tt>Malaysia's "easy exit" for illegal aliens, which began February 3, 1996
during the Hari Raya festival week, attracted few takers.  In response, the
Malaysian government extended the program until the end of February. </tt><p>
<tt>The Malaysian government estimates that 40,000 Indonesians have overstayed
their visas.  Under Ops Check-Out, these Indonesians can pay a fine of RM 1,000
or $400 for entering the country illegally or staying without proper permits
(the normal penalty is RM 3,000); pay for the return trip home; and be
fingerprinted--they can then leave Malaysia legally.  </tt><p>
<tt>The government admitted that many Indonesians may not have signed up for
fear of being unable to return to Malaysia later due to the finger-printing
requirement. </tt><p>
<tt>In early February, police in Kuala Lumpur detained 1,600 foreigners
suspected of being illegally in the country.</tt><p>
<tt>The government announced that a total of 608,000 foreigners were registered
with the Immigration Department in early 1996-- 249,185 Indonesian nationals,
79,688 Bangladeshis, 1,999 Pakistanis, 21,870 Thais, 26,049 Filipinos and
229,431 other nationals.  The three major sectors of legal foreigners
employment were plantations, with 180,688 foreigners, manufacturing 177,252,
and maids, 117,203.</tt><p>
<tt>The Malaysian Cabinet approved a fee structure for Indonesian maids.  Under
the new agreement with Indonesia, maids will pay RM 300 ($115) there for
"training" before their departure for Malaysia.  </tt><p>
<tt>If Indonesian recruiters attempt to pass this fee onto Malaysian households
that employ them, the government may expand the source counties of maids from
the current Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand to also include Sri Lanka
and Bangladesh.</tt><p>
<tt>Malaysian households already pay a fee of RM 1,870 to the Malaysian
government to receive permission to hire foreign maids, plus RM 500 to a
Malaysian recruitment agency to find them a foreign maid.  Indonesian maids
will have to pay RM 1,083 to recruitment agencies in Jakarta for placement fees
and services such as documentation, health examination, training, visa and
transportation.</tt><p>
<tt>Indonesian maids must be paid a minimum RM 350 ($135) per month in
Malaysia, or RM 450 if they have experience.  The Philippines requires Filipina
maids to be paid a minimum RM 500 ($190) per month.</tt><p>
<tt>The Malaysian government changed their policy of not granting work permits
to the spouses of foreign workers.  In granting work permits to spouses, the
government argued that the foreign spouses are already at home in Malaysia and
that it would be better than employing "strangers." </tt><p>
<tt>In an effort to eliminate the need for foreign workers at gas (petro)
stations, the first phase of installing 514 self service stations will be
completed in January, 1997.  The approximately 5,000 foreign workers now
employed as petrol kiosk attendants will lose their jobs. </tt><p>
<tt>A 1995 report by a non-governmental organization called Tenaganita
criticized the detention camps that hold illegal foreign workers as
"concentration camps."  The report detailed physical abuse, poor food and
sanitation and a lack of medical care.  The government admitted that 40 foreign
workers died in the camps in 1995.  Since the report, doctors visit the camps
weekly, and water is available all the time.  </tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC21">Taiwan:
Foreign
Workers</a></h2>
<tt>Taiwan has approved the entry of 290,000 foreign workers, and at the end of
October, 1995, there were about 193,000 foreign workers in Taiwan, including
131,000 Thais and 55,000 Filipinos.  Taiwan's unemployment rate is expected to
rise to 2.5 percent in 1996, prompting the government to slow down the entry of
foreigners.</tt><p>
<tt>A union official asserted that, in the six years since Taiwan permitted the
entry of foreign workers, some 450,000 have arrived or received approval to
work in Taiwan.  Some of the foreign workers have already departed, as have
some of the 90,000 illegal aliens.</tt><p>
<tt>Some 18,000 foreign workers were reported to have abandoned their
contracts, and 6,600 were apprehended.  Between January and October 1995, 390
foreign workers were arrested by police on criminal charges.</tt><p>
<tt>The Council of Labor Affairs has decided to allow some legal foreign
workers who lose jobs because of plant shutdowns to change jobs; they will be
allowed to go to work for affiliated companies who have received permission to
hire foreign workers, but have not yet brought them to Taiwan.  </tt><p>
<tt>The Taipei city government is proposing stiffer penalties for employers who
hire illegal immigrants.  Officials estimate that nearly 11,800 legitimately
hired foreign workers have fled their jobs and overstayed their visas in
Taiwan.  There are an additional 18,000 foreign workers in Taiwan. </tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC22">Hong Kong</a> Emigration Drops</a></h2>
<tt>In February 1996, the number of days until the Chinese takeover of Hong
Kong became less than 500.  Unexpectedly, in 1995, emigration dropped to its
lowest level in six years.  In 1995, 43,000 people left the British colony,
compared to 62,000 in 1994.  </tt><p>
<tt>Some officials predict the emigration in 1996 will be only slightly higher
than in 1995.  Other experts predict that the number of people emigrating from
Hong Kong will reach 90,000 to 100,000 in 1996, and may reach 200,000 by July
1, 1997, versus 43,000 in 1995 and 62,000 in 1994.</tt><p>
<tt>An estimated 10 percent of Hong Kong's 6.3 million residents could leave,
i.e., up to 600,000 have foreign passports.  Hong Kong's population rose by
160,000 in 1995, in part because of the immigration of 150 mainland Chinese
each day and more births than deaths.  An increase in foreign domestic helpers
and Hong Kong returnees also contributed to the rise.  </tt><p>
<tt>Pregnant mainland Chinese women come to Hong Kong to have their babies; in
1995, about 240 babies were born to "illegal mainlanders" each month. The
Chinese women hope that their children, by being born in Hong Kong, will have a
better chance of gaining residency there.  </tt><p>
<tt>The Chinese government has announced that it will no longer give permits to
pregnant women to enter Shenzhen's Shatoujiao restricted zone, from where most
of the women cross to Hong Kong.  The women wait until birth is imminent, cross
the border, and run to the nearby fire station.  The firemen are obligated to
take the women to the hospital.  </tt><p>
<tt>After birth, most of the women are repatriated to China, leaving their
newborns with their Hong Kong resident fathers.  Once in China, they can apply
for permits to return, but most must wait 10, 20 or 40 years to rejoin their
family.  Some mothers are allowed back into Hong Kong temporarily on visitors
visas. </tt><p>
<tt>One Hong Kong judge has said he will try to stop the incarceration of
pregnant illegal immigrants because he does not feel it is proper for the
babies to be kept in prison with their mothers.  </tt><p>
<tt>The head of the Illegal Immigrant Control Center in Hong Kong reports that
snakeheads, who have been smuggling CD-Roms, computer software and drugs
between Hong Kong and China, are now smuggling pregnant women into Hong
Kong.</tt><p>
<tt>A survey by the Hong Kong Association for Continuing Education gives poor
marks to education courses designed to help mainland Chinese children integrate
into Hong Kong society.  The association surveyed 50 voluntary agencies that
provided newly-arrived mainland children with four to six week English courses.
</tt><p>
<tt>More than 90 percent of the 535 replies from parents, students and
teachers, said the courses did not offer age and ability-appropriate education.
Many children complained that it they had to search for a school that would
take them--some were rejected by up to 20 schools. </tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC23">Filippin</a>Recruitment</a></h2>
<tt>Under Philippine law, agencies that arrange for Filipinos to work abroad
cannot charge the workers more than 5,000 pesos ($200).  Most workers pay far
more for foreign jobs--the going rate for going to Hong Kong as a maid is
25,000 pesos, and 60,000 pesos for a job in Taiwan.</tt><p>
<tt>The Philippines is also considering exempting maids working abroad from
paying Philippine income taxes.  With workers in over 40 countries, many
Filipinos abroad learn that they must pay income taxes on their earnings both
to their host country and to the Philippines.</tt><p>
<tt>After returning forcibly on February 14, 1996 at least one of 84 Vietnamese
from a camp that opened in 1978, the Philippines reversed course and announced
that the last of the 2,700 Vietnamese in the country who refused to return
could stay in the country.  There are still 36,000 Vietnamese in camps around
southeast Asia, and in January 1996, the Philippines agreed with Hong Kong,
Malaysia, and Thailand to return the remaining Vietnamese in 1996.</tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC25">Migration in Africa</a></h2>
<tt>In 1972, Idi Amin expelled most of the 70,000 Asians--who ran 90 percent of
Uganda's businesses--from the country.  Uganda became an economic back
water--its 18 million people in 1995 had an annual per capita income of less
than $200.</tt><p>
<tt>In 1990, Asians were allowed to return or file claims for their lost
assets, and 7,000 have returned, investing perhaps $500 million of the $2
billion in foreign investment in Uganda over the past five years.</tt><p>
<tt>Kenya in November, 1995 swept hotels and other housing in Nairobi and
detained foreigners who allegedly were in the country illegally.  Kenya
announced that many illegal foreigners were involved in criminal
activities.</tt><p>
<tt>Men who migrate from interior areas of the sub-Sahara to coastal cities for
work are bringing AIDS home.  In many villages of Niger and Burkina Faso, where
up to 80 percent of the working age males migrate to Abidjan, Accra, Lome, and
Lagos, and polygamy is common, AIDS is believed to be spread from the coastal
cities to the interior by migrants.</tt><p>
<tt>Zaire in February stepped up the pressure on Rwandans living in 40 camps in
Zaire to return to Rwanda.  The Kibumba camp, with 190,000 Rwandans, was closed
in mid-February when Zairian troops surrounded it to put economic pressure on
Rwandans to return.</tt><p>
<tt>The Hutu camps in Zaire were established 19 months ago, and have since
developed extraordinarily sophisticated markets, according to refugee
officials.  For example a 1995 survey of four camps in Goma found 82,000
businesses, including 2,300 bars and 450 restaurants, sometimes stocked with
war booty brought from Rwanda for what Hutu leaders thought might be a long
exile.  Zairian authorities have closed the Hutu businesses, on the grounds
that they do not pay local taxes. </tt><p>
<tt>At the request of Mozambique, the South African Cabinet on February 21,
1996 agreed to grant an amnesty to illegal immigrants from Southern African
Development Community countries if they have been in South Africa for five
years.  Illegal aliens from Angola, Botswana, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Zambia and the
island of Mauritius who have been in South Africa for five years, had a formal
or informal job, or a relationship with a South African spouse or child, could
receive permission to stay.</tt><p>
<tt>South Africa repatriated 72,000 people to Mozambique in 1994.  </tt><p>
<tt>There are an estimated three million illegal immigrants are in South Africa
and the government contends that they are creating a problem with cross-border
drug dealings. </tt><p>
<tt>South Africa and Botswana deported more than 24,000 Zimbabweans between
January and November, 1995.  According to South African police, most of the
illegal immigrants were searching for employment, while some were trying to
escape the police. </tt><p>

<tt>Labor contractors will have to renew their permits for foreign workers
during 1996.  Half of the 51,000 permits for foreign construction workers will
be renewed for the first six months of the year and the other half will be
extended until the end of 1996.  The Israeli Employment Service plans to study
if the continued employment of so many foreign workers is justified.  </tt><p>
<tt>Israel's Labor and Social Affairs Minister has announced a plan to tighten
the criteria for importing workers from the Philippines and to crack down on
people who illegally employ them after repeated complaints of abuse.  The
action was taken after a sharp rise the number of requests for workers in
December 1995.  There were 930 requests instead of the average of 150 in 1994.
The ministry has seen a gradual increase in monthly requests for Filipino
workers who care for invalids.   At the current rate, their number could exceed
12,000 a year. </tt><p>
<tt>An Israeli government document said that there are 100,000 foreigners
working illegally in Israel.  This number does not include Palestinians for the
West Bank or Gaza who are working in Israel without permission.  The Interior
Ministry has decided to issue newly licensed foreign workers with a special
identity card.  </tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC28">Immigration in Australian</a>Elections</a></h2>
<tt>Australia's conservative opposition leader John Howard, who is making a bid
to end Labor 13 years as head of government, pledged in February 1996 not to
cut immigrant numbers if his coalition won the March 2 election.  Howard lost
his party's leadership in 1989, in part because of a 1987 speech that asserted
"too many" Asian immigrants were coming to Australia.</tt><p>
<tt>Australia anticipates 83,000 immigrants in the year ending June 30, 1996.
Over half of these immigrants are not from the UK, and an increasing percentage
are from Asian countries.  If elected, Howard promised to spend ($40 million)
on English-language training and other programs to integrate immigrants.</tt><p>
<tt>Labor Party MP Graeme Campbell, who lost his party's endorsement due to his
criticism of the government's policies on immigration, has threatened to run as
an independent on an anti-immigrant platform in Australia's upcoming
elections.</tt><p>
<tt>One Australian researcher says that Australians are beginning to see the
economic impact of the migration policies, and that this will bring the issue
of race to the forefront. </tt><p>
<tt>A group of 38 Chinese boat people who arrived in Australia as illegal
immigrants have rejected an offer by the government to settle out of court.
They will press ahead with their claim that they were held for 418 days longer
than the 273-day limit for a decision to be made under the Migration Act.  The
Chinese boat people are demanding compensation.</tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC29">Gulf States</a>' Foreign Workers</a></h2>
<tt>A Saudi business group is asking the kingdom to allow foreigners to buy
property and invest in the domestic stock market.  Foreigners repatriated up to
$13 billion in wages in 1995.  Currently, non-Gulf Arabs are not permitted to
trade in the Saudi stock market or buy property, but they can invest in mutual
funds through Saudi banks.  There are more than six million foreigners among
the 17.9 million Saudi population.  </tt><p>
<tt>Kuwait's Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs is considering limiting the
term of residency permits for expatriate workers to one year.  Under current
law, residency permits for workers are issued for two to four years.  The aim
of the one-year permit would be to cut back on illegal visa trading and paper
companies set up only for labor recruitment purposes.  The proposed residency
limit would not apply to foreign employees in the government sector or to
maids.  Kuwait issued over 800,000 visas to foreign workers in 1995.  </tt><p>
<tt>About 1,000 foreign workers will be fired by the Kuwait Post Authority in
the next three months as it tries to increase profitability.  Most of the
foreign workers are Arabs and Asians employed as clerks.</tt><p>
<tt>Since November 1994, Shia Muslims in Bahrain have protested the policies of

of the unemployed from the Shi'ite Muslim village communities.  </tt><p>

<tt>Lim, Lin and Nana Oishi.  1996.  International Labor migration of Asian
Women:  Distinctive Characteristics and Policy Concerns.  Geneva:  ILO.</tt><p>
<tt>This report says that some 800,000 Asian women leave their country of
nationality for foreign jobs each year, and that they stay abroad an average
two years, so that about 1.5 million mostly Indonesian, Filipina, Sri Lankan,
and Thai women are employed as maids and entertainers in Asia and the Middle
East.  In some labor-importing countries, half of the Asian women are working
illegally.</tt><p>
<tt>The report places much of the blame for the migration of women, and the
conditions in which they live and work, on labor contractors and brokers, who
are involved in the migration of 90 percent of all Asian women:  "Were it not
for illegal recruitment agencies...Asian labor migration would not have reach
such a massive scale."  The majority of women migrating for jobs from Indonesia
and Sri Lanka do so illegally.</tt><p>
<tt>However, sending countries can do little to police labor brokers--the

laws to protect female migrants.</tt><p>

Congress in March took up proposals by Senator Alan Simpson (R-WY)--S S269 and
S1394, and Representative Lamar Smith (R-TX)--HR2202, the Immigration in the
National Interest Act--to deal with legal and illegal immigration.   <p>
On March 21, the House approved the part of the Smith bill that seeks to reduce
illegal immigration on March 21,1996 by a vote of 333-87.  However, the House
voted 238-183 to drop the reductions and changes in the legal immigration
system proposed in the bill.<p>
The Senate Judiciary Committee on March 28 voted 13-4 to send bills to the full
Senate for consideration April 15-17 that would deal with both legal and
illegal immigration.  The legal bill is the opposite of Simpson's original
proposal--it would INCREASE the number of visas available to unify families to
500,000 per year, and not impose fees on US employers who want to admit
immigrants to fill US jobs.<p>
Opponents of the proposed reductions in legal immigration split the
comprehensive bill into legal and illegal components, under the theory that
there are more votes in Congress to reduce illegal than legal immigration.  <p>
In June 1995, the Clinton administration endorsed the Jordan Commission
recommendation that legal immigration be reduced from about 800,000 in FY94 to
550,000 per year, with the temporary addition of 150,000 visas per year to
clear the backlog of spouses and children of legal immigrants waiting to join
family members in the US.  <p>
Despite that endorsement, the Clinton administration supported the division of
the immigration bill, probably ensuring that the legal immigration system will
not be changed in 1996.<p>
<b>House</b>.  The House began consideration of its comprehensive reform of
legal and illegal immigration on March 18, 1996, and on March 21 approved the
part of the bill that aims to reduce illegal immigration by a vote of 333-87.<p>
One of the first amendments offered was to split the bill into separate legal
and illegal components, as the Senate Judiciary Committee had done on March 14.
The House vote to split the bill was 238-137--an "unusual coalition" of
President Clinton, liberals and ethnic advocates, high-tech businesses,
libertarians, and the religious groups including the Christian Coalition
opposed reductions in legal immigration--many of these groups opposed
immigration reform in 1986.<p>
The bill approved by the House would beef-up-the-border bill and add new bars
to access by illegal aliens to education and welfare.  The bill as approved
would double the Border Patrol from 5,000 to 10,000 agents by the year 2000,
authorize the construction of a 14-mile triple fence on the US-Mexican border
south of San Diego, and set up a five-state pilot project that permits
employers to verify the work eligibility of all new hires by checking a
computer data base.  The House rejected the Smith bill's effort to make Social
Security cards more counterfeit-resistant by 1999.<p>
The House also approved, 257-163, with Speaker Gingrich's support, a so-called
"Proposition 187" amendment that permits states to deny public education to
illegal alien children, and to prohibit states from offering federally financed
welfare benefits to illegal aliens.  Parents who are illegal aliens could not
apply for welfare assistance for their US-born and thus US-citizen children.
US-born children of illegal alien parents could still get AFDC and Food Stamps,
but a third party would have to apply for such benefits on behalf of the
children.<p>
Many experts believe that, if Congress approves the denial of free public
education to unauthorized children, the US Supreme Court will reverse the 5 to
4 Plyler vs Doe decision in 1982 that found unconstitutional a 1975 Texas law
that kept unauthorized children out of school.  In the Plyler decision, the
Supreme Court acknowledged that education was not a "fundamental right," but
the majority decision emphasized that Texas provided no evidence "suggesting
that illegal entrants impose any significant burden on the state's economy."
<p>
California asserts that about five percent or 350,000 children in K-12 schools
are unauthorized, and that their education costs $1.8 billion per year.<p>
To cut down on the use of false documents, the bill reduces from 29 to six the
documents that workers can present to employers to prove their legal status,
and treats document forgers as harshly as money counterfeiters.  The approved
bill permits the imposition of fines of $50 to $250 on people caught inside the
US illegally, and permits state and local law enforcement officials to detain
illegal aliens until the INS can take custody of them.<p>
The House on March 21 rejected by a 242-180 vote an effort by growers to launch
a new guest worker program.  On March 5, 1996 the House Agriculture Committee
approved 25 to 14 an amendment by Rep. Richard Pombo (R-CA) to the House
immigration bill that would grant temporary work visas to 250,000 foreign farm
workers, with the ceiling to be reduced by 25,000 each year.  The existing
temporary farm worker program admitted about 17,000 H-2A workers in 1995.<p>
There are about two million workers employed at some time during a typical year
on the nation's crop farms, and a DOL survey estimates that 25 percent may be
unauthorized.<p>
Under the Pombo proposal, growers, labor contractors, or associations wanting
to employ foreign farm workers would have had to file at least 25 days before
the job was to begin a labor condition attestation (LCA) with their state
Employment Service office listing the number of foreigners requested and when
work was to begin.  Local ES offices would review these LCAs "only for
completeness and obvious inaccuracies" within seven days after they are filed.
Employers violating their attestations or program rules can be assessed civil
money penalties, and be debarred from the program.<p>
Under the rejected plan, 25 percent of the foreign workers' wages would be
placed into a federal trust fund managed by the INS, which foreign workers
could reclaim with interest in their country of origin.  Foreign workers would
be limited to a maximum two years in the US.  Program costs would be financed
by employer contributions equivalent to Social Security and unemployment
insurance taxes that would not be paid by growers.<p>
The guest worker program would sunset after three years if Congress fails to
re-authorize the pilot five-state telephone verification system that the Smith
bill establishes to make it easier for employers to determine whether workers
are presenting false documents. <p>
Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Texas) argued against the guest worker program: "once you
admit hundreds of thousands of people like this, why not just pull the Border
Patrol off the border and let people in?"  The Clinton administration opposed
the program for fear that it would increase illegal immigration, reduce job
opportunities for US workers, and depress wage and work standards for US
workers.  The Clinton administration also believes that the current H-2A
program is sufficient for businesses that are experiencing labor shortages. <p>
After the House Agriculture Committee vote, Secretary of Labor Robert Reich and
US Attorney General Janet Reno wrote to Senate Judiciary chairman Orin Hatch
(R-Utah) that they would "strongly recommend" a veto of the entire immigration
legislation if it included temporary foreign farm worker provisions for
agriculture.<p>
On March 20, the House voted 221-191 to split the Smith bill and to deal only
with illegal immigration.<p>
To reduce legal immigration, both the Senate and House bills would have
eliminated immigration slots for relatives such as adult sons and daughters and
adult brothers and sisters of US citizens, but added slots for five years to
expedite the unification of nuclear families of legal US immigrants.  Some
850,000 of the 1.1 million foreigners waiting to enter the US to join legal
immigrant fathers or mothers are the families of persons legalized in 1987-88.
Half of these spouses and children are believed to be already in the US with
their families.<p>
The bill approved by the House requires Americans who wish to sponsor an
immigrant to earn at least twice the poverty level income.  This means that the
requirement will double from the $14,800 for a family of four required in 1993.
The bill also makes legally binding sponsors' agreements to assume financial
responsibility for the immigrants they bring to the US.<p>
One of the most contentious issues in Smith's legal immigration reform bill is
whether to eliminate immigration visas for the adult brothers and sisters and
adult sons and daughters of US citizens.  Among the arguments for doing away
with these categories is that most such siblings are adults with families,
whose immigration therefore sets off chain migration.<p>
A GAO study released in March 1996 concluded that chain migration occurs, but
not soon after immigrants naturalize.  According to the GAO, an average 12
years elapsed between the time an immigrant enters, and the date the immigrant
petitions for the entry of relatives. <p>
The Smith bill would require adult children wishing to bring their elderly
parents to the US to provide health insurance for them.<p>
<b>Senate</b>.  When the Senate Judiciary Committee met to consider the Simpson
bill on February 29, 10 of 18 senators were prepared to vote to split the bill
into legal and illegal components.  Simpson delayed consideration of the bill
for one week, and then dropped a proposal to reduce the number of immigrants
admitted for economic/employment reasons each year from the current 140,000 to
90,000--there were 93,000 admissions of workers and their dependents for
economic/employment reasons in FY95.  <p>
On March 14, the Senate Judiciary Committee nonetheless voted 12 to six to
split Simpson's bill into legal and illegal components, and approved amendments
that would keep fines against employers who knowingly hire illegal aliens at
current levels, rather than increase them as Simpson proposed-- first offenses
currently can result in civil money penalties (CMP's) of $2,000 per worker.
The committee also voted to eliminate the requirement that employers caught
repeatedly hiring illegal workers could have their property seized.<p>
Simpson also dropped a plan to require US employers wanting permanent
immigrants to pay the greater of $10,000 or 10 percent of the first year's
salary into a fund that would be used to train US workers to fill similar job
vacancies in the future, as well as a plan to prohibit US employers from
dismissing US workers and hiring temporary foreign workers to replace them.
The  bill as approved would prohibit US employers from applying for a temporary
foreign worker if they have laid off a U.S. worker with the same skills in the
previous six months.<p>
US high technology companies and Jack Kemp, co-director of Empower America, led
the fight against Simpson's proposed fees.  A report entitled "Employment-Based
Immigration and High Technology" argued that immigrants admitted permanently to
fill vacant US jobs provide "extraordinary benefits" to the US.  The report
predicted that new restrictions on employment-based visas would "drive more
companies to locate research and development offshore, and will lead to less
innovation, a less dynamic economy, and fewer jobs produced in the cutting edge
industries of tomorrow."  <p>
The CEOs of Silicon Valley companies weighed in with assertions that their
companies have unfilled vacancies for engineers, and that the immigrants on
their staffs are necessary to create good jobs for US workers.<p>
INS data indicate that most of the visas granted to immigrants on employment
grounds go to technicians with two years of training, not to persons with
"extraordinary ability" or to "outstanding professors and researchers."<p>
In 1994, about 123,000 permanent immigration visas were issued for
economic/employment reasons.  About half--60,000-- of these visas went to the
spouses and dependents of the "needed workers"--only 40,000 visas went to
workers, including 4,000 to "unskilled workers."  Another 22,000 visas went to
Chinese students who were studying in the US when the Tiananmen Square massacre
occurred in 1989.<p>
Foreigners are admitted for employment reasons under three preferences.  There
were 21,000 first preference admissions in FY94, but only 1,300 went to "aliens
of extraordinary ability," and 1,800 went to  "outstanding professors or
researchers."  Some 5,000 went to "multinational executives or managers;"  this
category required at least one year's employment with the company.  Finally,
13,000 visas went to the spouses and children of first preference workers.<p>
There were 6,800 visas issued to second-preference workers with "exceptional
abilities" and "professionals with advanced degrees,"  including artists who
caught the eye of a US opera or dance company while studying in the US.  Many
of the artists seeking to become legal residents under the second employment
preference complain that, because they are self-employed or freelance
performers and do not have a US sponsoring employer, they find it hard to
secure legal immigrant status.<p>
The largest share, about  60 percent of the economic/employment visas in FY94,
went to the third preference for "skilled workers, professionals and other
workers" with at least two years training or experience.<p>
The number of third-preference visas has grown from 40 percent of all
employment visas issued in 1992 to 60 percent in 1994.  According to corporate
executives, it is difficult to find Americans for the jobs filled by
third-preference immigrants, especially administrative assistants.   <p>
The "growth wing" of the Republican party, which generally backed Steve Forbes
to be the Republican candidate for president, favors more immigration.  Their
"manifesto for immigration" in the Wall Street Journal February 28, 1996 called
immigration a "brain gain" for the US, and quoted former President Reagan
saying that his "shining city on the hill"--a metaphor for the US-- needed
walls, but with doors "open to anyone with the will and heart to get here."
<p>
Simpson proposed changes to the legal immigration system that would eliminate
immigration visas for adult relatives of US citizens, but add visas to expedite
the unification of nuclear families of legal immigrants.  Some called Simpson's
plan to deny entry to up to 2.5 million relatives such as adult brothers and
sisters of US citizens who are on waiting lists to immigrate, and to add visas
for the spouses and children of aliens legalized in 1987-88, a "reward" for
lawbreakers, and a penalty on those who "played by the rules."<p>
To reduce illegal immigration, Simpson's bill proposes an expansion of the
Border Patrol by 700 agents, from the current 5,500, increased penalties on
employers who hire unauthorized workers, and the elimination the requirement
that the INS obtain search warrants before entering open fields to check for
illegal alien workers.  On March 21, the Senate Judiciary Committee voted 12-4
to require a triple fence to be built along the Mexico-US border south of San
Diego.<p>
On March 7, the Senate Judiciary Committee voted to substitute a three-year
pilot program to verify the legal status of newly hired workers, and applicants
for public assistance, rather than the national verification program within
eight years originally proposed by Simpson.<p>
On March 28, the Senate Judiciary Committee voted 11-4 to modify the process of
allocating visas for family unification.  Under the approved revision, US
citizens can sponsor spouses, minor children, and parents each year--there is
no quota, but 250,000 admissions annually are expected.  In addition, the
approved amendment would permit another 175,000 immigrants to come to the US
for family unification reasons--at least 75,000 would be reserved for the adult
children of US citizens, and the other 100,000 would be available, in order,
for spouses and minor children of legal immigrants, adult children of US
citizens, adult children of legal immigrants, and adult brothers and sisters of
US citizens.<p>
There is a backlog of 1.1 million spouses and minor children seeking to join
legal immigrants in the US, and a backlog of 1.6 million adult children and
brothers and sisters of US citizens waiting to enter the US.  The Senate bill
would provide an extra 75,000 visas for 10 years to reduced these backlogs.<p>
Current law permits 480,000 family unification immigrants annually.  The Senate
bill, as amended March 28, would permit 500,000 family unification immigrants
per year for 10 years, a four percent increase.<p>
Simpson's proposal to allow the INS to hire 600 retired federal employees to
process backlogged asylum applications and exempt them from a law that reduces
their salaries to account for their federal pensions was eliminated on March 5
by the House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight's Civil Service
Subcommittee.<p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC3">Presidential
Candidates and
Immigration</a><a></a></h2>
Immigration divided the "Big 4" candidates for the Republican presidential
nomination, which was wrapped up by Bob Dole on March 19 in the Midwestern
states, and confirmed March 26 in California.<p>
Candidates Dole and Buchanan argued over who supported Prop. 187 more
vigorously in 1994; Forbes and Alexander opposed Prop 187.  Dole and Buchanan
favor reductions in legal immigration, and making English the official language
of the US; Forbes and Alexander would keep legal immigration at current
levels.<p>
All the Republican candidates promised to do more to reduce illegal
immigration.  Buchanan favors construction of a wall or fence along the
southwestern border, and Dole supports Simpson's bill in Congress to add more
Border Patrol officers and experiment with a registry so that employers could
more easily determine who was legally authorized to work in the US.  Alexander
called for a new branch of the military to deal with border control.<p>
Clinton and Dole reportedly have similar immigration positions, with the
exception that Dole favored Prop. 187 while Clinton opposed it.  During the
third week in March, Buchanan pledged to build a 2,000-mile long fence, the
Clinton administration announced progress in slowing immigrant smuggling, and
Dole visited the border to announce that he supported the "Prop. 187" amendment
included in the House immigration reform proposal to deny free public education
to unauthorized children.<p>
Buchanan was the only Republican candidate to attack employers who hire illegal
aliens:  "There are many corporations which are repeatedly hiring illegal
immigrants and firing their American workers... You have to repeatedly fine and
punish companies that do that."<p>
Republicans are divided on immigration--54 percent favor a "five-year ban on
all legal and illegal immigration into the US," according to a Wall Street
Journal/NBC poll.  Some pundits argue that issues that seemed like sure winners
for Republicans in 1994--Prop. 187 and opposition to affirmative action and
racial preferences--in 1996 may get Republicans labeled as "fanatics."  <p>
A March 1996 Newsweek poll found that 36 percent of respondents think recent
immigrants have burdened their communities, versus 31 percent who believe that
recent immigrants contributed to their communities--33 percent said that
immigrants had no significant effects.<p>
However, Governor Wilson is advising Dole to focus on immigration and
affirmative action to close the 20-point lead that Clinton currently has over
Dole in California. <p>
Because of difference in demography and business,  immigration did not play as
big a role in the Texas primary as it did in the California contest.  In Texas,
about 15 percent of the 9.5 million registered voters are Hispanic.  Voters in
Texas can vote either Republic or Democratic in the primary.  Texas politicians
are concerned that attacks on illegal immigration could tarnish the state's
relationship with a major trading partner, Mexico.  <p>

<a name="RTFToC4">INS:
Sanctions, Apprehensions, Immigration, and
Naturalizations</a><a></a></h2>
<u>Sanctions.</u>  The San Francisco Chronicle published a long article on
March 18, 1996 reporting that fewer than half of the 12,700 US employers that
INS inspectors recommended be fined between 1989 and 1994 for employing illegal
aliens or not completing I-9 employee verification forms were in fact fined.<p>
The INS has 320 workplace inspectors to check on seven million US employers.
The average INS fine levied on employers between 1989 and 1994  was $1,612.
INS fines are often characterized by employers as a "the cost of doing
business."  <p>
On March 21, 1996, the INS announced its largest ever fine--a $1.5 million fine
on suburban New York janitorial firm Colin Cares for knowingly hiring over 150
illegal aliens, and for 2,500 cases of paperwork violations.  Over 2,500
unauthorized workers were dismissed from the company's 4,000 person work force.
Colin Cares cleaned buildings that housed, inter alia, IBM and ATT.<p>
The INS plans to hire 384 additional workplace inspectors in 1996, bringing the
total to about 700 in the 19,000 employee INS.<p>
In addition, there are about 900 federal labor inspectors who contact the INS
if they suspect that illegal aliens are employed when they check for minimum
wage and other violations.<p>
The Chronicle emphasized that there are significant discrepancies in
enforcement between cities.  For example, the INS collected more CMP fines from
employers in Laredo, Texas than in Los Angeles, and made more collections in
Grand Island, Nebraska than in Fresno, California.  The INS collected twice as
many fines in Cleveland as in San Francisco.<p>
The number of INS workplace inspectors dropped by half between 1989 and 1994.
Consequently the number of workplace investigations dropped from 14,700 in 1989
to 6,000 in 1994, as the INS diverted resources to deporting criminal aliens
and going after immigrant smuggling rings.<p>
The INS estimates that 90 percent of US employers comply with laws that aim to
prevent the employment of unauthorized aliens.  DOL investigators, on the other
hand, estimate that only about 47 percent of employers are in compliance with
immigration laws.  The INS usually gives three days notice before inspecting
workplaces, and obtains permission from workers before interviewing them--DOL
does not.<p>
<u>Apprehensions.</u>  Some 1,381,465 foreigners were apprehended by the US
Border Patrol in calendar year 1995, up 43 percent from 965,144 in 1994.  In
some areas of Arizona, apprehensions increased 500 percent over 1994 levels,
and are higher in 1996 than 1995.  <p>
In the remote Arizona town of Douglas, the number of Border Patrol agents
jumped from two in the early 1980s to 127 in 1996, and migrants unable to cross
the border south of San Diego reportedly paid $800 to smugglers to get them to
Chicago through Douglas.  Most aliens carry no money with them; their friends
and relatives pay the smuggler when the alien is delivered.<p>
No one knows whether the increased number of apprehensions reflects more
Mexicans attempting illegal entry, or more success by the Border Patrol in
apprehending foreigners, or some combination of the two.<p>
President Clinton on March 19 unveiled his FY97 budget, and it included a 16
percent increase in the INS budget, to $3.1 billion, to cover the cost of an
additional 826 Border Patrol agents and 1,889 other INS employees.  Clinton
also proposed $500 million to reimburse states for the cost of incarcerating
unauthorized aliens.<p>
Academics at the University of Houston estimated that up to 330 unauthorized
aliens die each year trying to sneak into Texas, usually by drowning in the Rio
Grande.  Many of the poor US counties along the border do not have medical
examiners, so many of the bodies found do not have $500 autopsies performed to
determine the cause of death. Only about 40 percent of the estimated 3,200
alien deaths between 1984 and 1994 were recorded by the state of Texas.<p>
Surveys of 2,500 Mexicans in four central Mexican villages found that the
number of persons headed for the US was up 30 percent in 1995 versus 1994.
However, some analysts argue that the cost of migration has increased with the
stepped-up Border Patrol presence, and the increased number of apprehensions
simply reflects their success in apprehending a steady number of persons
attempting entry.  <p>
Other reports indicate that smugglers' fees are usually paid by US friends and
relatives when the alien is successfully delivered, so that the peso
devaluation would not affect these presumably US-earnings.<p>
In Brownsville, Texas, 54 Honduran children were found abandoned by smugglers
who "rented" them to make it easier to adults to be smuggled into the US.  Of
Honduras's population of 5.5 million, 2.7 million are minors under 18 years of
age, and 28 per cent of Honduran children aged 10 to 17 do some kind of work<p>
The INS has 316 miles of various types of fences along the 2,000 mile
Mexican-US border.<p>
<u>Immigration</u>.  The number of legal immigrants admitted to the US in FY95
fell to 720,461, down 10 percent from 804,416 in FY94, and down 20 percent from
904,292 in FY93.  There were only 85,336 employment-based immigrants and their
families admitted [the quota is 140,000 per year], and there were declines in
the number of spouses and parents of US citizens, and a special program that
permitted 55,000 dependents to join newly legalized immigrants expired in 1994.
There were 106,827 refugees who were recognized as US immigrants in FY95.  <p>
Of the 85,000 employment-based visas issued, only 37,000 or 43 percent were
principal workers--the others were their spouses and children.<p>
The major countries of origin were Mexico (12.5 percent), the Philippines (7.1
percent), Vietnam (5.8), the Dominican Republic (5.3), China (4.9), and India
(4.8).  States of intended destination included California (166,482), New York
(128,406), Florida (62,023), Texas (49,963), New Jersey (39,729), and Illinois
(33,898)--immigration was down in each of these states except Florida.<p>
Immigrants arriving in FY95 indicated that they were moving to states that
previously not receiving large numbers of immigrants, such as Georgia and
Michigan.  California was the destination of 29 percent of all immigrants in
FY93, but only 23 percent in FY95.   <p>
One-third of California's 166,482 immigrants in FY95 were from Mexico (21
percent) and the Philippines (14 percent).  The Los Angeles-Long Beach area
received 54,669 legal immigrants in FY95, half the 106,703 in FY93.<p>
It is not yet clear whether the recent drop in immigrant admissions signifies a
trend toward less immigration.  Some of the FY95 drop may be due to delays in
setting up the so-called "245i" adjustment program, which permit persons
already in the US to adjust their status rather than return to their countries
of citizenship and present themselves to a consular officer.  An analysis of
1990 Census data found that about 30 percent of the persons counted as
immigrating in 1990 were living in the US in 1985.<p>
Backlog, apprehension, and other data suggest an increasing, not a decreasing
influx of immigrants.  There are about 2.7 million foreigners on immigrant
waiting lists.<p>
The Current Population Survey estimates that the number of Mexican-born
residents in the US jumped by 500,000 between March 1994 and March 1995.  Since
there were 111,000 Mexican immigrants in FY94, this suggests that four
unauthorized Mexicans may have arrived in the US for each legal immigrant.<p>
<u>Naturalization</u>.  The INS also announced in March 1996 that its
Citizenship USA drive handled 500,000 citizenship applications in FY95.  In
1990, only 40 percent of the 19.8 million foreign-born persons in the US were
naturalized US citizens, the lowest level in many years.  Beginning in 1994,
the number of immigrants applying for naturalization surged.<p>
The INS hopes to reduce what is now a one-year wait in some cities between the
time that a settled immigrant applies for US citizenship on an N-400 form and
is scheduled for an INS interview.<p>
About 75 percent of the one million applications filed in FY95, and the one
million expected in FY96, are filed in five cities--Los Angeles, Miami, New
York, Chicago, and San Francisco.  <p>
According to election experts, newly naturalized US citizens mostly vote
Democratic.  In New York City, West Indians, who have achieved more political
power than any other immigrant group in that city, vote Democratic. Dominicans,
the city's largest immigrant group, vote primarily Democratic.  Most Colombian
and Ecuadorian immigrants are registered as Democrats, more than half of them
voted for the Republican mayoral candidate. <p>
The Asian American Studies Center at the University of California, Los Angeles
estimated in March that 80 percent of Asian immigrants eventually become U.S.
citizens.  Asians are less likely than whites to register to vote, but those
who are registered are among the most likely voters to go to the poll on
election day.  In 1994, 75 percent of the registered Asian Americans voted,
compared to 73 percent of the whites, 64 percent of the Hispanics and 63
percent of the African Americans.  <p>
The Asian-American population is 7.2 million, and is projected to be 11 million
in the year 2000, and 20 million by 2020.  According to one study, "Asian
Pacific Americans: Reframing the  Immigration Debate," one-fourth of the high
tech companies in California's Silicon Valley are run by Asian-Americans.
Among Americans 25 to 38 years of age in 1990, Asian Pacific Americans were
twice as likely as non-Hispanic whites to have received a post-college
degree.<p>
On March 5, 1996, California again sued the federal government asking that it
either take custody of the roughly 18,000 illegal aliens held in California
state prisons, or fully reimburse California for the cost of incarcerating
them.  <p>
California has about 138,000 inmates in state prisons-- 38,000 were born
abroad, and 18,000 are believed to have been unauthorized aliens when they
committed crimes that had them sentenced to one year or more.  California
estimates that it spends about $22,000 per prisoner per year, or $400 million
to incarcerate illegal aliens--90 percent are Mexican nationals.  One estimate
is that 98 percent of all illegal immigrants who are deported for committing
felonies in California eventually return to California and, of those who
return, 40 percent will commit crimes again.<p>
Attorney General Janet Reno acknowledges the federal government's
responsibility, but points the finger at Congress for not providing the
necessary funds to incarcerate the illegal alien criminals.  In FY95, the
federal government had $63 million to pay for illegal immigrant prisoners; and
it expects $500 million in 1996-97.<p>
In January 1996, the INS deported over 5,000 criminal aliens, keeping on its
announced pace of deporting 62,000 criminal aliens in FY96.  Two-thirds of the
criminal aliens deported so far in FY96 are Mexican nationals. <p>
Persons held less than one year, and until trials, are usually held in city and
county jails.  California's Orange County found in a September 1995 survey of
the jail that 35 percent of the inmates were illegal immigrants.  Under a
proposed program, an INS agent stationed at the jail will identify illegal
immigrants prior to their first court appearance and arrange for deportation.<p>
The INS announced in March that the second Special Cuban Migration Program
would permit Cubans in Cuba between 18 and 55 who satisfy at least two of three
conditions--completed secondary school, have three or more years of work
experience, and have relatives in the US--to register for one of 20,000
immigration slots designated each year for Cubans.  The application period is
from March 15 to April 30, 1996.  As of March, more than 8,400 Cubans have been
approved for legal migration to the US under this program.  <p>
Some Cubans who have returned to their homeland say that they been victims of
reprisals, and claim that the US is not taking seriously their complaints of
retaliation.  They complain that instead of treating them as victims of
political persecution, the US tells them to apply for one of the 20,000 slots
for Cuban immigrants.<p>
Some returned Cubans have reported difficulty in finding and keeping jobs
because they are labeled politically "unreliable."<p>
The INS also announced in March that it would extend until March 27, 1997 the
Temporary Protected Status of about 4,000 Liberians who have been in the US
since 1991.<p>
On March 20, 1996, green cards issued to permanent resident aliens before 1979
expired, and all immigrants had to obtain new pink cards that are harder to
forge, and that must be renewed every 10 years.  Thousands of immigrants jammed
INS offices on March 20 for the new cards, despite several extensions of the
deadline to renew their cards.  There were believed to be about 1.5 million
legal immigrants with the old green cards in November 1993, when the
replacement program began.<p>
Lawful immigrants are required to carry evidence of their legal immigrant
status, and expired green cards no longer provide that evidence.  The INS urged
those who qualify to apply for naturalization rather than another green card.<p>
Profiles of Central American migrants who lived for five to 10 years in the US
after applying for and being rejected for asylum in the US emphasized that few
parents facing deportation want to take their children back to Nicaragua or El
Salvador with them, and that many parents simply disappear when they are
finally ordered to surrender to the INS.  In a recent Sacramento case, a
Nicaraguan woman with five children who were born in the US fled instead of
surrendering to the INS for return to Nicaragua. <p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC5">US
and California Population
Growth</a></></a></a></a></a></h2>
The US Census Bureau reported March 12 that, by 2050, the non-Hispanic white
share of the population would drop to 53 percent, down from 74 percent in 1995.
The Hispanic and Asian shares of the population are expected to more than
double to 24 and eight percent, respectively.  The African American share of
the population will climb slightly to 14 percent in 2050, up from 12 percent in
1995.<p>
In 1995, there were about 193 million non-Hispanic whites, 31.5 million blacks,
26.9 million Hispanics, 8.7 million Asians and Pacific Islanders and about two
million Native Americans.<p>
For the first time in 200 years, a non-white group contributed more to annual
population increase than non-Hispanic whites.  According to the Census report,
"U.S. Population Estimates by Age, Sex, Race and Hispanic Origin: 1990-1995,"
in 1993-94, the US Hispanic population increased by 902,000, and the
non-Hispanic white population increased by 883,000.  <p>
The US population is expected to increase by 2.4 million per year, from 263
million in 1995 to 394 million in 2050.  Fueled by immigration--the Census
assumed a net influx of 820,000 legal and illegal immigrants annually-- and
births to immigrants, the Hispanic and Asian populations in the US are expected
to grow by over three percent per year, faster than the growth of Mexico's
population in 1995, which was 2.2 percent per year.  The white population is
projected to increase by about 0.4 percent per year.<p>
The new forecasts lower projected immigration from 880,000 to 820,000, but
increase projected fertility by NOT assuming that the currently higher than
average fertility of Hispanic and Asian women will converge to lower average
levels for the US population. <p>
By 2030, non-Hispanic whites will be a minority of the US population, but
almost three-fourths of those 65 and older are projected to be non-Hispanic
whites.  <p>
The New York Times billed these projections as a "profound demographic shift."
Dan Walters of the Sacramento Bee, who has written extensively on the political
implications of demographic change in California, noted that in this case,
California today exemplifies the nation's future.<p>
In 1970, California's population composition was similar to that of the US
today--about three-fourths non-Hispanic white.  Today, non-Hispanic whites are
about 50 percent of the population, Hispanics are almost 30 percent, and
Asian-Americans are approaching 10 percent.  <p>
Walters emphasizes that the VOTING population changes much more slowly than the
population-- non-Hispanic whites may be only 50 percent of the population in
California, but they cast 80 percent of the votes in the 1994 election.
Non-Hispanic whites have a median age of almost 50, versus about 30 for
Latinos.<p>
Some speculate that the combination of ethnic shifts and age twists may make
very contentious federal policies that redistribute tax funds from younger
minority workers to older white residents.  In Fall, 1996, for example, the
number of K-12 pupils is expected to reach 52 million, surpassing the 1971 baby
boom peak, and to rise to 55 million by 2002, in part because of immigration
into cities that sold of demolished school buildings in the 1980s.<p>
There are about 24 million foreign-born persons in the US--immigrants who moved
to the US from other countries are about nine percent of all US residents.
Most are in the US legally, the number of unauthorized aliens in the US is
believed to be about four million.  About 75 percent of the legal immigrants,
and 85 percent of the unauthorized aliens, are believed to be in six
states--California, New York, Texas, Florida, New Jersey, and Illinois.<p>
In 1970, there were about 10 million immigrants in the US, and 20 countries had
sent 100,000 or more of their citizens here.  By 1990, there were 41 countries
from which 100,000 or more citizens migrated to the US.<p>
In 1970, the average foreign-born person earned more than a similar US-born
person--similar in terms of years of education and age.  In the mid-1990s,
foreign-born persons earned less than similar US-born adults, leading to what
some call the "de-skilling" of immigration, and allegedly increasing the effect
of immigrants at the bottom of the labor market, and increasing immigrant
welfare costs.  Some studies suggest that 20 to 40 percent of the increase in
the wage gap between the least and most skilled workers in the US is due to
immigration.<p>
The US Census Bureau reported in October that,<b> </b>among the nation's 271
metropolitan areas, three of the four fastest-growing are along the US-Mexican
border.  Between 1990 and 1994, the population of Laredo, Texas grew by 22
percent; the population of McAllen, Texas by 20 percent; and, the population of
Yuma, Arizona by 19 percent.<p>
The US population was 263 million on July 1, 1995.  About 83 percent of the US
population is white, 13 percent African American, 10 percent Hispanic, and four
percent is Asian.  <p>
California's population was 31.6 million on July 1, 1995, including 9.1 million
in Los Angeles county, 2.6 million each in San Diego and Orange counties, and
1.6 million in San Bernadino county, and 1.3 million in Riverside county.  In
Los Angeles, immigration is transforming neighborhoods--Watts is now 70 percent
Hispanic, up from 60 percent in 1994.<p>
Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan predicted that, "in 15 years, Los Angeles
will again be a town with a strong middle class, mainly Latinos and Asians.
They will make relatively less money than the average middle-class citizen
today, but there will be more houses with two, three or four wage-earners."<p>
Between July 1994 and June 1995, some 383,000 California residents left
California, bringing to 1.5 million the number of residents who left the state
since 1990.  However, California's population continued to increase because of
immigration and a baby boom--there were 343,000 more births than deaths.<p>
The Census uses July-June years to report population changes and, it noted that
net foreign immigration to California peaked at 296,000 in 1992-93, dropped to
260,000 in 1993-94, and dropped again to 234,000 in 1994-95.  These immigration
data mirror national trends--net US immigration was 835,000, 754,000, and
702,000 in these years, giving California 35, 34, and 33 percent of US
immigrants in the 1990s.<p>
During the 1980s, California's population rose by 25 percent, while the US
population rose by 10 percent.  The US population was 262.8 million on July 1,
1995, including 31.6 million in California, 18.7 million in Texas, and 18.1
million in New York--one in four US residents lived in these three states.
California's population is expected to be 36 to 38 million by 2005, depending
on the strength of the state's economic rebound.<p>
These population changes were driven largely by demography and economic
circumstances.  The US economy added 1.7 million jobs in 1995, bringing payroll
employment to 117 million.  California added 300,000 jobs in 1995, bringing its
payroll employment to 12.6 million.  Unemployment in December 1995 was 5.6
percent, and 7.7 percent in California.<p>
California has 7.7 million foreign-born residents, or 40 percent of the
nation's immigrants.<p>
As California bounces back from recession, there is renewed interest in whether
the state that would be the world's seventh largest economy presages trends
elsewhere in the US economy.  Some students of the California economy argue
that California's experience simply reflects national trends, so that slow
economic growth and strained public finances, inequality, and rising health
care costs reflect developments common to the US and many other industrial
economies.<p>
The California economy produces goods and services worth about $900 billion
annually.  Almost one-fourth of all California households have incomes above
$75,000 per year, versus about one-fifth of US households.<p>
California's 1980s boom, 1990s bust, and mid-1990s resurgence is centered in
Los Angeles county, which accounts for almost one-third of California's
population and labor force.  Los Angeles county lost almost half of its
defense-related jobs between 1988 and 1995.  Since 1990, Los Angeles county
lost about 510,000 jobs, but gained back about 150,000 of them by 1996.<p>
Los Angeles county now has about 133,000 aerospace jobs, down from 300,000, and
130,000 motion picture jobs, which some consider only 50 percent of the total
employment in the industry because of the large number of independent
contractors and persons affiliated with the motion picture industry.<p>
The California-is-unique analyses, on the other hand, argue that California's
economy has been affected primarily by defense cutbacks, immigration, and rules
and regulations that stifle business expansion.<p>
The percentage of Americans living in poverty fell from 15.1 percent or 39
million in 1993 to 14.5 percent or 38.1 million in 1994.  The poverty rate is
determined by multiplying the cost of a minimum diet by three--persons whose
income falls below this line are considered poor--the income needed to lift a
family of four above poverty in 1994 was $15,141.<p>
These census data measure pretax income.  If the value of in-kind transfers
such as health insurance or public housing is included, the number of poor
people falls; if the cost of food is one-fourth rather than one-third of a poor
person's expenditures, the number of poor people rises. <p>
The median income of American households was $32,264 in 1994, practically
unchanged from 1993.<p>
Many of the welfare programs being debated in Congress aim to prevent children
from growing up poor.  According to a recent Government Accounting Office
review of census data, about 17 percent of the school-aged children (five
through 17) were living in households with below poverty-level incomes in
1990--some 7.6 million children.  <p>
However, 31 percent of the school-aged children in households headed by
immigrants lived in poverty-- 709,000-- including 43 percent of the children in
households headed by an immigrant from Mexico--299,000--and 40 percent of the
children in households headed by an immigrant from Vietnam--46,700.<p>
Population growth and change are linked closely to issues such as social
security funding.  In 1995, there was one person 65 and older for every four
persons 20 to 64; by 2030, the ratio will be almost two older for every three
of working age.<b></b><p>
<b></b>The US Census has announced that it will use sampling to enumerate the
projected 276 million residents on April 1, 2000.  The 2000 Census is expected
to cost $3.9 billion.<p>
Under the new plan, the Census will use several attempts to get completed
census questionnaires until 90 percent of the households in a county have
responded (in 1990, 63 percent of households returned Census forms by mail).
Then Census interviewers will visit a random sample of the 10 percent of
households that did not respond, and use this interview data to estimate the
characteristics of non-respondents.  It is still planned that one in six
households will get the "long form" that requests information on income,
housing, and other items. <p>
On March 20, the US Supreme Court ruled unanimously that the 1990 Census does
not need to be adjusted, despite an acknowledged undercount of especially urban
minorities.  The city of New York and 23 other cities filed suit against the
Bush administration when it refused to adjust the 1990 Census to account for
the estimated 1.6 percent  of the 250 million residents who were not counted in
particular cities and states.<p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC6">Mexico</a>
Professionals Being Drawn to
US</a>
</a></h2>
Mexican professionals such as teachers and doctors are reportedly being drawn
to the US because of unemployment in Mexico.  According to a March 4 story in
the Wall Street Journal, some teachers who could earn $35 per week in Mexico
prefer $200 per week picking fruits and vegetables across the border in
southern California.<p>
Over the past 25 years, the number of Mexican college
graduates--licenciados--increased in all fields.  Over 1.3 million Mexicans
graduated from college in the 1980s, when there were only 300,000 jobs created
for them, persuading some of them to emigrate for jobs.  One Mexican dentist
who graduated in 1986 reported that 25 percent of his classmates were working
in the US--usually not as dentists.<p>
NAFTA permits governments of one member nation to accuse another for allowing
violations of its own labor laws.  The US made four complaints since January
1994--two involving GE plants in Mexico, one involving a Sony plant, and one
involving a Honeywell plant.<p>
For the first time, Mexico accused the US of not remedying a US labor law
violation.  On July 14, 1994 Sprint closed a facility that sold long-distance
service to Latinos, just before a union election by the 200 largely
Spanish-speaking employees.  An NLRB administrative law judge sided with
Sprint's argument that the facility was closed for lawful economic rather than
unlawful anti-union reasons.<p>
The governor of Guerrero took a leave of absence while Mexico's Supreme Court
investigated his possible role in a June 1995 massacre of 17 peasants by
police.  An investigation by state officials led to the jailing of several
police officers, but exonerated the governor.  Mexico's current
decentralization of power is illustrating the practically unlimited power of
some state governors, and corruption in the police and judiciary.<p>
Mexican local police, who reportedly earn $135 per month in Mexico City, and
the federal police, who earn about $250 per month, have in some instances
fought one another for the right to "protect" local drug dealers and supplement
their incomes.<p>
Mexico in March 1996 rejected October 1995 suggestions by US Defense Secretary
Perry to conduct joint US-Mexican military exercises.  However, three US
military incursions into Mexico over the past 150 years led Mexico to reject
the presence of US troops on Mexican soil.<p>
The number of people living along the Mexico-US border was about 100,000 in
1900, and about 10 million in 1995, making water an increasingly contentious
issue between the US and Mexico--El Paso residents use about 210 gallons per
person per day, versus about 70 gallons in Juarez.<p>
Nicaragua in 1996 began to issue new and more counterfeit-resistant passports.
Under the Sandanistas, Nicarguan passports were sold or given to foreigners who
supported the regime, including five persons involved in the World Trade Center
bombing in 1993.  At least 900 passports have been issued to persons wanted for
terrorism, including Italian Red Brigade leaders.<p>

<a name="RTFToC7">Immigration
</a>and
Vot</a>ing</a>
</a></h2>
A federal court issued a ruling on March 11, 1996 that upheld the creation of a
horseshoe-shaped Chicago congressional district to remedy past discrimination
against Hispanics.  The 4th congressional district was created after a 1991
lawsuit that led to Illinois' first Latino-majority district, represented by
Luis Guitierrez since 1992.  The decision is expected to be appealed to the US
Supreme Court. <p>
The decision may affect how Chicago ward maps are drawn, although some Hispanic
leaders claim wards are different because the boundaries are negotiated by the
Latino leadership.  However, current ward maps are being challenged by the
Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, which argues that the
boundaries were drawn to protect Aldermen John Daley, brother of Mayor Daley,
and Edward Burke.  <p>
In a comparison of immigrant political influence in the nation's two largest
cities, it was emphasized that immigrants in New York City are more likely to
gain political clout than immigrants in Los Angeles because many more
immigrants in New York have legal status.  Further, it is easier for immigrants
to have political influence in New York's 52-seat city council than in Los
Angeles, which has only 15 seats in its  city council and a five-member board
of supervisors.<p>
There is much speculation about the "sleeping giant" of Latino political power
in California.  The number of Latinos in the California Senate and Assembly
doubled from seven in 1992 to 14 in 1996, despite a decline in the number of
Democrats in California.  There are 10 Latinos in the 80 member Assembly, and
four Latinos in the 40 member Senate.<p>
About nine percent of California voters were Latino in 1992, 11 percent in
1994, and possibly 15 in 1996.<p>
In Santa Clara county, California, the number of Mexican-born voters increased
by 22 percent between February 1995 and February 1996, but they still were only
8,500 of the county's 728,000 registered voters.  There are 14.1 million
registered voters in California.<p>
Some older immigrants in citizenship classes say they want to become US
citizens because they fear that the government will cut off Medicare and Social
Security benefits for legal immigrants. <p>

There were about 300,000 applications for asylum in the EU in 1995, down
slightly from 305,000 in 1994, and down over 50 percent from the peak 674,000
in 1992.  About 40 percent of Europe's asylum applications were in
Germany--128,000 in 1995.  In the Netherlands, asylum applications fell to
53,000 in 1995 from 29,000 in 1994, and in Sweden, from a peak 84,000 in 1992
to 4800 in the first half of 1995.<p>
Some estimates are that EU countries removed 200,000 aliens in 1995.  Britain
sent 2,600 aliens to their countries of origin in 1995, Germany sent 60,000 by
air out of the country, and France removed 10,000 aliens.  The centers where
aliens are held before removal-- Amsterdam has Grenhospitium, Britain has
Campsfield, Transit Centre 127-Bis is in Steenokkerzeel, Belgium, and Cortemark
in Germany --the biggest such center in the EU--have become the targets of
immigrant rights protests.<p>
EU officials from home affairs and interior ministries meet under the auspices
of the K4 Committee, Steering Group 1 (Asylum and  Immigration), to coordinate
their efforts to deal with asylum seekers.  With their support, most EU
countries are drawing up a "white list" of countries from which an applicant
for asylum has the duty to prove that he is suffering political persecution,
and no right of appeal if the applicant has come via another "safe" country.<p>
The unemployment rate in the 15-nation EU is 11 percent, and is higher for
foreigners than EU nationals.  There are some 10 million non-EU nationals in
the 15-member EU, and the EU is under pressure to permit, e.g., a Turkish
immigrant in Germany to move freely to France. <p>
In Rome, thousands of people representing political parties, trade unions and
immigrants rights activists marched in Rome on March 16 to demand better
conditions for the 520,000 illegal, and one million legal, foreigners in Italy.
<p>
The number of Europeans aged 60 and over is projected to double to 114 million
by 2025, and the over-60 population will be one-third of all residents.  Some
estimate that, to keep social welfare states viable, up to seven million
immigrants annually may be needed, versus the current 500,000.<p>
The top 10 countries attracted 300 million of the world's 567 million tourists
in 1995, according to the World Tourism Organization in Madrid.  France
attracted 61 million tourists in 1995, followed by 45 million each in Spain and
the US, 29 million in Italy, and 23 million each in China and the UK, 22
million in Hungary, 20 million in Mexico, 19 million in Poland, and 18 million

<u>Ethnic Germans</u>. The German Social Democratic Party was accused of
fanning the flames of xenophobia when its leaders campaigned against allowing
220,000 ethnic Germans to move from the ex-USSR to Germany each year, saying
that they "migrate directly into the unemployment benefit and social security
system."  Germany spends about $2.2 billion annually to support and integrate
ethnic Germans.  <p>
Most ethnic Germans, who acquire German citizenship automatically, vote for the
governing Christian Democratic Union.<p>
Ethnic Germans are persons descended from Germans invited to Russia's Volga
River valley in 1762, but then deported to Siberia and Central Asia during
World War II.  Germany's 1949 Basic Law includes the provision that ethnic
Germans who suffered because they were Germans have the right to enter Germany
as citizens.<p>
Germany has already reduced the benefits available to ethnic Germans, reducing,
for example, the length of state-financed German-language education from 15
months to six.<p>
According to the SPD, Germany cannot absorb ethnic Germans when unemployment is
11.1 percent, meaning that four million persons were jobless.  Over half of the
unemployed in Germany are women.<p>
On March 24, voters in the states of Rhineland-Palatinate, Schleswig Holstein
and Baden-Wurttemberg elected state parliaments, and the SPD saw its share of
the vote decline by between four to six percent in each state.  The liberal
Free Democratic Party had a surprisingly strong showing.  Although the
elections do not directly affect the federal government, Helumt Kohl claimed
that the votes supported his policies. <p>
Dieter Spori, the SPD candidate for state premier who had campaigned against
the immigration of ethnic Germans from the former Soviet Union, said he would
no longer play a leadership role in the SPD after he lost the election in
Baden-Wurttemberg.  Spori conducted a populist campaign that included attacks
on immigrants. <p>
On the other hand, SPD leader Oskar Lafontaine said he did not believe his
party's losses in the three states was due to opposition to ethnic German
immigration.  According to a March 1996 survey, 70 percent of
Germans--especially those in the former West Germany--agreed with Lafontaine's
call for a stoppage or severe restrictions the influx of ethnic Germans.<p>
The governing coalition and church groups denounced the SPD.  Some 397,000
ethnic Germans arrived in Germany in 1990.  Beginning in 1993, a quota of
220,000 per year was introduced.  Germany has been admitting about 200,000
ethnic Germans per year since 1988; about 80 percent were born after 1945.  The
government argues that the ethnic Germans take farm and factory jobs that
Germans shun.<p>
Interior Minister Manfred Peuchel of Saxony-Anhalt said that the migration of
young East Germans to West Germany, and the aging of the remaining population,
means that the former East Germany needs young ethnic Germans.<p>
In Sohren, a town of 2,000 south of Coblenz, about 1,200 ethnic Germans are
living in former US military barracks, and their presence has created divisions
in local schools, where non-German speaking children sometimes outnumber the
native-born children.<p>
There are about 7.2 million foreigners in Germany, but only about 10,000
non-ethnic Germans are naturalized each year.<p>
<u>Kurds.</u> Turkish Kurds living in Germany went on "rampages" March 9 and 16
in northwestern Germany.  Demonstrations were planned in anticipation of the
Kurdish new year March 21, and Kurdish demonstrators clashed with police who
tried to remove banned Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) banners--PKK banners are
illegal in Germany.  There are believed to be active 3000 PKK members in
Germany.<p>
The resulting violence led to "consensus" that foreigners who organize or
participate in violent protests in Germany should face deportation.  There are
between 400,000 and 500,000 Kurds among the two million Turks in Germany, about
the same proportion as among Turkey's 60 million residents.  Kurds have been
fighting to succeed from Turkey since 1984.<p>
On March 27, the Kohl coalition in Bonn agreed to expel foreigners involved in
illegal demonstrations by redefining participation in a banned
demonstration--currently a misdemeanor--to be a severe violation of public
order that leads to automatic expulsion.  <p>
Police raided the asylum center in Halberstadt on March 22, and seized PKK
materials.  About 1,300 of the 1,900 asylum seekers in Halberstadt are Kurds.<p>
Seven people died and 73 were hurt in 146 fires in hostels for refugee  asylum
-seekers in  Germany in 1994 and 1995--in 41 cases, arson was suspected.<p>
<u>Construction</u>. On March 22, some 12,000 workers demonstrated in Munich
against the employment of foreigner workers at wages below those paid to German
construction workers.  Under current rules, subcontractors based in another EU
country can legally undercut German pay rates by recruiting in their own
countries at local rates then sending the workers to a German building site.<p>
On March 23, another 6,000 workers demonstrated in Magdeburg. <p>
In collective bargaining to implement a German government proposal to resolve
the EU construction worker issue, IG Bau demanded a minimum hourly wage of
DM19.58 for non-German EU workers from the first day of their employment in
Germany, up sharply from the current DM12.  Employers offered DM15, and the
issue was sent to an arbitrator for a decision by April 8.<p>
If there is no agreement, the union could call the first ever nationwide strike
in construction.<p>
The European Council's social affairs committee on March 29 tackled the issue
of paying all EU workers the same wage at the same work place.  The UK, Ireland
and Portugal have fought the proposed "equal pay" directive.  <p>
A compromise has been proposed by the Italian president of the EU, which would
stipulate that the "equal pay" directive would apply to EU workers immediately
when an EU national is employed in another EU country.  The previous proposal
would have permitted lower wages for the first month of employment.<p>

<a name="RTFToC11">France:
African Immigrant
Sit-in</a></></a></h2>
On March 18, 1996, some 400 immigrants from Mali, Senegal and Mauritania began
a week-long  sit-in at a church in Paris to demand French residency permits.
The African immigrants were evicted on March 22 by police despite a reported
assurance from Prime Minister Alain Juppe that police would not enter the
church.<p>
About 300 of the immigrants then moved to a gymnasium, where two days later the
police again removed them to prevent any "risk of violence."  Juppe was
criticized in the press for the March 24 pre-dawn raid.  Many of the Africans
involved have lived in France for more than 10 years without residency papers.
<p>
Days after the evacuation, 67 of the immigrants were in a Paris court.  On
March 27, a French appeals court overturned a lower court ruling that released
38 of the immigrants arrested during the sit-in, and the police are expected to
overturn another court order that released some of the other immigrants.  Most
of those released had disappeared by the time the first court ruling was
overturned.<p>
On March 28, 50 of the asylum seekers were flown to Mali.<p>
The French government said that the church sit in was a staged protest.  The
government announced on March 26 that it will close some of the loopholes that
allowed the first court to release some of the immigrants apprehended, and
strengthen laws that remove immigrants from France.  Draft interior ministry
legislation includes rules that would establish fingerprint banks, computer
lists of people harboring aliens, and simplified procedures to deport illegal
aliens-- only 20 percent of the aliens ordered deported from France are
actually removed from the country.<p>
The number of foreigners naturalizing in France rose 30 percent in 1994
compared to 1993.  About 26 percent of the new French citizens were Moroccans,
15 percent were Portuguese, 10 percent were Tunisian, and nine percent
Algerians.<p>
The number of French residents rose to 58.3 million in 1995, reflecting the
difference between 710,000 births, 529,000 deaths, and 45,000 net immigrants.
About 36 percent of the births were to unmarried mothers.<p>
There are about four million foreign-born persons living legally in France, and
up to one million unauthorized aliens.<p>

<a name="RTFToC12">Asylum
in UK</a>
</a></h2>
On March 5 an immigration judge ordered the British government to reconsider
its decision to deport Mohommed al-Masaari to the Caribbean island of Dominica.
The judge said that the government had attempted "to circumvent the Convention
(on Refugees) for diplomatic and trade reasons."  The Saudi government had
threatened to break British arms contracts if the Saudi dissident was allowed
to remain in the US.  <p>
The judge told the Home Office to reconsider Masaari's asylum application
within one month.  <p>
The Saudi dissident runs a North London-based organization called the Committee
for Defense of Legitimate Rights, which advocates replacing the Saudi monarchy
with an Islamic government.  <p>
The British government is considering plans to increase the number of people
deported by elevating the Home Office's Immigration and Nationality Department
to executive agency status, and rewarding managers for meeting deportation
targets.  Britain deports less than 10 percent of failed asylum seekers--the
rest disappear or reapply for asylum.  <p>
In 1994, there were 32,800 asylum applications-- 4,500 foreigners were allowed
to stay in Britain, and 1,580 people were deported.  The remaining 26,720
people are unaccounted for. <p>
In 1995, all 2,000 Nigerians who applied for asylum in Britain had their
applications rejected.  A 70-page report issued by the Refugee Council on March
25, also said that all Rwandans, and 91 percent of the Sri Lankans, were
rejected for asylum despite civil unrest in both countries.<p>
The High Court ruled on March 27 that the withdrawal of welfare benefits from
most asylum seekers under new government regulations was lawful.  Foreigners
who do not apply upon their arrival are not eligible for income support,
housing benefit, or other welfare payments.<p>
The High Court noted that 32 per cent of the 2,900 asylum applications filed in
1984 were approved, but that only four percent of the 32,800 filed in 1994
resulted in a grant of asylum suggesting to the Court that the government acted
properly in reduce benefits to mostly false asylum seekers.<p>
On March 5, 1996, the British government promised local authorities
compensation to meet legal obligations to asylum seekers.  Local councils must
house people, including asylum seekers, under homelessness legislation until at
least the summer  of 1996, when the Asylum and Immigration Bill is expected to
become law.  Local councils will have to care for the children of asylum
seekers beyond that date under the Children's Act.  <p>
The British Home Office asked the Commission on Racial Equality to draw up
guidelines to prevent employers from discriminating against minorities to avoid
fines under the proposed employer sanctions law.  Under the proposal, employers
could face criminal penalties and fines of up to L5000 ($7,700) if they
knowingly hired an illegal worker.<p>
The number of illegal aliens caught working in the UK increased from 4,000 in
1988 to 10,000 in 1995.<p>
Prime Minister John Major announced on March 4 that up to two million Hong Kong
residents will continue to be able to visit Britain without visas after 1997.
They will be able to visit Britain for up to six months, and will not have the
right of abode or to work. Some Tory MPs feel that the UK faces an illegal
immigration "nightmare." <p>
Major also announced that Hong Kong's ethnic minorities, primarily Indians and
Pakistanis, would be guaranteed the right to live in Britain after the turnover
if they came "under pressure to leave Hong Kong." <p>
After the announcement, other European countries were expected to may adopt
similar policies toward Hong Kong residents.  <p>

<a name="RTFToC13">Immigration
in
Poland</a></></a></a></a></a></h2>
In 1994, 74 million foreigners entered Poland, including eight to nine million
citizens of the former Soviet Union, many to request asylum, others for
employment, and some to transit to the West.  Poland receives 500 to 600 asylum
applications every year. <p>
Poland permits immigrants to enter for economic reasons as long as an
individual can prove strong ties to the Polish community and the ability to
contribute to Polish society.  Those seeking employment in Poland receive work
permits on the basis of employer guarantees.  <p>
In 1994, 14,000 work permits were issued to foreigners.  However, under a new
regulation that took effect in October, 1995, first-time work visas are issued
only at Polish consular posts abroad.<p>
The Polish Border Guards Commandant said on March 26 that Poland must have a
more effective control of border traffic to prevent border crime.  In April,
1996, 10 new watch-towers will be built and two to four helicopters will begin
to patrol the border, including the Polish-Lithuania border where 20 airplanes
reportedly illegally smuggle in people and goods. <p>
The Border Guards report that border enforcement has already reduced illegal
immigration.  The Border Guards admit that the smugglers from the CIS and Asian
countries are better organized and equipped than they are.  About 12,000
illegal immigrants were stopped at the border in 1995.  <p>

<a name="RTFToC14">Turkey</a>:
 Economic
Meltdown?</a></a</a></a></h2>
Turkey, one of the world's major potential countries of emigration, was thrown
into political uncertainty after the Islamist Refah party won 158 seats in the
550-member Parliament in elections held December 24, 1995--the next two largest
parties have 135 and 132 seats.  <p>
The Refah or Welfare party's success was attributed to honest local governments
in the 23 cities it controls, including Istanbul and Ankara, and grass-roots
campaigning at weddings etc, putting the party closer to many people than the
mainstream parties.  Refah opposes the current Turkish ban on headscarves in
public offices, arguing that culture is religion, and that women who want to
cover their heads should be allowed to do so.<p>
Turkey is often described as a country on a knife edge, sometimes tilting
toward Europe, and sometimes toward the Middle East.  To try to win the
December election, the government printed money, and in 1996 inflation, the
budget and trade deficits, and interest rates are up, and several
closely-watched businesses such as car assembly announced plans to close at
least temporarily because of falling sales.  <p>
Real incomes in Turkey fell about 20 percent in 1995, the social security
system is bankrupt, and privatization is much slower than planned.  As in
Mexico, the government keeps going by offering Turks--who buy two-thirds of the
country's debt--interest rates of over 100 percent for three and six month debt
instruments.<p>
Some speculate that the military could stage a coup, as in 1980, to restore
stability.<p>
Sweden, which deported Kurds who lied about their identity--usually claiming to
be Iraqis--has agreed to reopen " thousands" of cases to determine if the
foreigners really needed protection in Sweden despite lying about their true
identity.  Some 500,000 people were granted residence permits in Sweden, which
has a population of 8.5 million, between 1979 and mid-1995.<p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC16">Japan:
 Managing Migration</a>
</a></h2>
On March 6-8, 1996, Nihon University hosted a conference on the Dynamics of
Labor Migration in Asia.  Selected papers on labor recruitment and the
migration transition will be published in a special issue of the Asian and
Pacific Migration Journal, edited by Philip Martin, Andy Mason, and Toshikzau
Nagayama.<p>
The conference was unusual in three respects.  First, it focused on three
understudied issues--labor contractors and smuggling, trade in services and the
migration of professionals, and the migration transition, or the movement of a
country from being a net labor exporter to being a net labor importer.<p>
Second, these issues were examined comparatively, with researchers'
presentations being critiqued by policy makers.<p>
Third, conference participants discussed migration issues with Japanese
employers, unauthorized workers, and local officials in areas where, in one
city, almost 10 percent of the population were foreigners.<p>
There are 1.32 million foreigners in Japan, making them 1.1 percent of the
total population. <p>
These field trips provided several insights.  First, immigration and
integration policies are being made locally in Japan, as local officials react
in an ad hoc manner to events that arise when foreigners and foreign workers
are present.  They prepare booklets in e.g., Portuguese and Japanese on how to
separate garbage for pickup, and establish bilingual classes to accommodate
foreign students.  <p>
Local officials seem to be aware that Japanese immigration policy is to avoid
the settlement of foreigners, but they nonetheless are implementing policies
that make it easier for foreigners and their children to settle in Japan,
including the provision of Japanese language classes and the support of
Japanese-foreigners associations for Nikkeijin, the mostly Brazilian and
Peruvian workers of Japanese descent who get three-year work permits to enter
Japan.<p>
Private organizations are also being established to help foreigners.  The All
United Workers Union has opened a hall in Ueno, Tokyo where about 40 foreigners
working for small manufacturing companies can get help and advice in Urdu,
Bengali and French--the workers are from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Senegal.
About 900 non-Japanese workers are dues-paying members of the Tokyo-based
union.<p>
Second, foreign workers are to some extent a structural feature of the Japanese
economy and labor market--the number of foreigners in at least some industries
and areas is increasing along with the unemployment rate, as especially young
Japanese workers avoid so-called 3-D jobs--dirty, dangerous, and difficult.  <p>
Unemployment in Japan reached 3.2 percent in 1995, for an average 2.1 million
unemployed workers--youth unemployment reached 6.1 percent.<p>
There appears to be very little enforcement of employer sanctions--at least
some of the employers who hire unauthorized workers do so fairly openly, and
report that they do not fear visits or fines from labor or immigration
inspectors.<p>
A June 1995 survey of 1,731 companies in the Tokyo Metropolitan area found that
17 percent of respondents had foreign workers on their payrolls, up from six
percent in 1991.<p>
Third, immigration policy is closely linked in the minds of local government
officials and employers to industrial policy.  Foreign trainees are meant to
serve as a bridge to foreign investment to e.g., China and Indonesia,
especially for small firms that do not have a foreign presence.  <p>
The aging Japanese industrial work force is training young foreigners in Japan,
helping industries from garments to machinery preserve production in Japan in
the short run and, since most of the trainees return to their countries of
origin, to show local workers how to do things the Japanese way if the Japanese
establish a local facility in the cities from which they come.<p>
Most foreigners holding unskilled or semi-skilled jobs in Japan appear to be
either Brazilians of Japanese descent who get three-year permits to live and
work in Japan, trainees from nearby Asian nations, or unauthorized foreign
workers.  The ethnic Japanese from South America are treated as Japanese
workers, participating in Social Security and other labor market programs, and
paid the same as Japanese workers doing similar work.<p>
The trainees, on the other hand, reportedly cost a Japanese employer the same
150,000 yen ($1500) per month that a Japanese high school graduate would cost,
but the composition of the employer's cost of labor is very different for
foreign trainees.  Trainees in one city receive a cash allowance about $400 per
month, and $200 per month for food.  The other $900 represent costs the
employer incurs for transportation, housing, fees, and clothing.  In some
cases, trainees pay kickbacks to their sending organization from their
allowance, such as to a public organization in China.<p>
In early February, Japan intercepted 60 Chinese trying to sneak into
southwestern Japan.  The captain of the ship had charged the workers 180,000 to
210,000 yuan ($21,000 to $24,500) to be smuggled into Japan.<p>
The number of foreign students enrolled in Japanese universities and technical
schools was 53,847 in May 1995, including 45,245 who were studying in Japan at
their own expense.  Foreign students in Japan are permitted to work 28 hours
per week.<p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC17">Singapore:
Debate on Foreign
Workers</a><a></a></a></a></h2>
During a debate on the budget on March 20, several members of the Singapore
House of Representatives raised the issue of deregulating the employment of
foreign workers.  Singapore's labor minister responded that the government
needed to control foreign workers in Singapore to balance their employment
against long-term national interests.  The prolonged use of foreign workers, he
asserted, could have adverse economic, social and political effects. <p>
During the debate, the labor minister argued that continued access to foreign
workers could discourage employers from training local workers and upgrading
their operations.  He encouraged employers to find innovative ways to overcome
manpower shortages, and rejected calls to eliminate the foreign worker levy and
the limits on the number of foreign workers allowed in various sectors.  <p>
The government also rejected a proposal to establish a minimum wage for foreign
workers, saying it could result in unrealistic labor costs for employers and
undermine the country's competitiveness. <p>
The number of foreign workers in Singapore jumped from 70,000 in 1975 to
350,000 today.  The share of foreigners in the work force rose from seven
percent in 1975 to 20 percent of the 1.7 million workers in the country in
1995. <p>
Despite tight controls, the number of foreigners overstaying their visas is
also climbing.  In 1993, 6,000 remained past their expiration date, in 1994,
the figure jumped to 7,000, and between January and October, 1995, over 5,000.
<p>
An estimated 10,000 aliens annually are smuggled into Singapore, usually by
smugglers who provide them with false passports.  According to Singapore's
immigration department, counterfeit social visit passes, which previously cost
about S$100, are now so readily available that the price has dropped to S$10.
<p>
Construction is a major employer of legal and illegal foreign workers.  In
construction, employers may have up to five foreign workers for every one
Singaporean, provided they pay a monthly levy for each foreign worker-- S$200
(US $141) for a skilled worker, and S$440 for an unskilled worker.  <p>
The Employment of Foreign Workers Act took effect late in 1995, and it
penalizes labor contractors between S$15,000 (about $10,700) and S$30,000, or
jail for a term of not more than one year, or both.  There is also a fine of
between S$50,000 ($35,700) and S$100,000 for employers who have committed
immigration offenses that are punishable with mandatory jail or caning.
Illegal workers are also fined: up to S$5,000 or imprisonment of up to one
year, or both. <p>
Under the new law, foreigners who overstay their visas for more than 90 days,
or who enter Singapore without a valid travel document, can be punished with
three strokes of the cane, as can employers found with five or more illegal
workers.<p>
In the past, many construction contractors claimed that they did not know that
their subcontractors were using illegal workers.  The new law helps identify
the main contractor who was previously protected by sub-contractors.<p>
On March 14, a subcontractor was sentenced to eight months' jail for illegally
hiring 105 foreign workers at two construction sites in 1995.  This was the
first case involving a single employer caught for employing a large number of
illegal workers. <p>
The number of employers prosecuted for employing illegal workers rose from 31
per month in 1994 to 43 per month in 1995.  About 750 illegal aliens are
apprehended each month in Singapore.<p>
Singapore is one of the world's richest "developing" nations, with a per capita
GDP of $24,000, higher than that of the UK, and roughly equivalent to
France--its three million people had a 1995 GDP of about $82 billion.  However,
only about three percent of the country's workers have a college degree or
more, although the government notes that almost one-fourth of the new entrants
to the work force have college degrees.<p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC18">Hong
Kong</a>/a></a>
and the UK</a>
</a></h2>
British Prime Minister John Major announced on March 4 that Hong Kong residents
with blue-covered Chinese Special Administrative Region (SAR) travel documents
will be able to enter Britain without visas for up to six months, but will not
have the right of abode or to work.  Some Tory MPs feel that the UK faces an
illegal immigration "nightmare," since, they argue, the UK is really admitting
mainland Chinese without visas.<p>
Singapore and South Africa are expected to follow the UK's lead and permit
visa-free entry with SAR documents.<p>
Many Hong Kong residents nonetheless waited long hours near the end of March to
obtain British National Overseas passports, which they thought would make
future international travel easier--80 countries allow visa-free entry to BNO
passport holders.  March 31,1996 was the last day for Hong Kong residents to
obtain British National Overseas passports.  There is a limit of 3.3 million
BNO passports that can be issued to Hong Kong's 6.3 million residents.<p>
Major also announced that Hong Kong's ethnic minorities, primarily Indians and
Pakistanis, would be guaranteed the right to live in Britain after the turnover
if they came "under pressure to leave Hong Kong." <p>
A total of 90,000 Hong Kong residents applied for<b> </b>naturalization in the
UK in March, compared with 34,500 in all of 1995 and 18,000 in 1994.  <p>
Hong Kong residents are permitted under US law to defer immigrating to the US
until 2002.  In 1995, about 39 percent of those who received immigration visas
elected to defer migrating.<p>
Australia estimates that there are 220,000 multiple entry visitor visa holders
from Hong Kong in Australia at any one time, eligible to stay up to one year,
and that, in 1997, some may stay and request asylum.<p>
In 1994, the Fiji government invited up to 28,000 Hong Kong Chinese to
immigrate, a move opposed by 76 percent of both native Fijians and Indians.
Most Fijians are Methodists, and the Methodist church is leading the opposition
to the plan to admit Hong Kong Chinese, arguing that the Chinese will bring
drugs and prostitution to the island.<p>
Under the plan, Hong Kong residents who wish to immigrate would have to pay
$30,000 per family, and invest at least $100,000 in Fiji.  Cynics think the
corrupt government ministers want to pocket the fees.<p>
Easy access to Shenzhen, China, a special economic zone set up 16 years ago to
help industrialize the mainland, has led to a restructuring of the Hong Kong
economy.  Manufacturing firms such as Hitachi are relocating to China for
cheaper land and labor.  Only an hour from Hong Kong, more than 150,000 Hong
Kong nationals earn their living in the Shenzhen region of China.<p>
Shenzhen residents have the highest average monthly salaries in China (about
$450), about twice monthly earnings in Beijing.  <p>

<a name="RTFToC19">Korea</a>'s
Foreign
Trainees</a>/a></a></h2>
In February 1996, the quota for foreign trainees in South Korea increased to
70,000.  By the end of February, some 50,000 foreign trainees were in Korea.
They receive basic training; most work in small manufacturing companies for one
year.  <p>
The government has developed several strategies to help small businesses deal
with labor shortages.  Small businesses with less than 50 employees are allowed
to have a work force composed of up to 20 percent foreigners, up from the
previous 10 percent foreigners ceiling.  The government also assigns some young
Korean men to small businesses in lieu of military duty--some 15,000 Koreans
were assigned to small business in 1996.<p>
Foreigners will be recruited to work on fishing vessels in South Korea for the
first half of 1996 in order to alleviate labor shortages.  About 1,000
foreigners workers will be placed aboard fishing vessels on a trial basis.  The
number of offshore fishing workers is expected to fall 10,500 short of the
51,500 needed.<p>
The labor shortage, which peaked in 1991, was caused by reduced birth rate,
exhaustion of the rural labor surplus, and the declining labor force
participation of the young, more of whom are studying longer.<p>
There are approximately 84,000 illegal workers in Korea.<p>
There are three types of illegal foreign worker in South Korea.  The most
common arrives with a short-term visa, such as a tourist visa, and remains
illegally in the country to work.  The second type enters South Korea with a
fraudulent passport or is smuggled in.  The third type enters legally as a
trainee, and either overstays the trainee visa, or illegally changes jobs.<p>
The South Korean government is currently considering the passage of the Foreign
Employment Act, which will address some of the legal and social issues that
arise with foreign workers.  But the government warned that it will take
several years of study before the legislation can be approved and implemented.

Experiences
Immigration</a><a></a></a></h2>
Some of North Korea's 22 million residents are reportedly crossing the Yalu
river into China because of food shortages.  China's Jilin province includes
large numbers of ethnic Koreans, and the Yalu river is shallow enough that
people can wade across.<p>
China's missile tests in the Taiwan strait led to numerous ads in Taipei
newspapers offering, e.g., " missile protection passports" for T$100,000"
($3,600), or permanent residency in Costa Rica within 60 days.  So-called
immigration fairs drew 30,000 to 40,000 people in March.  About 20,000
Taiwanese emigrate each year to the United States, Canada, Australia, New
Zealand and South Africa.  However, more Taiwanese have reportedly "bought
protection" by acquiring passports from Dominica, the Seychelles, Vanuatu,
Belize, Namibia and Costa Rica.<p>
China's population rose by 12.7 million in 1995; China's goal is to keep its
population to 1.3 billion by 2000.  There are 10 countries with more than 100
million residents, and two--the US and Japan--are among the world's wealthiest.
China has 30 provinces, 19 of which have more than 30 million residents.<p>
China's gross domestic product GDP in 1995 was 5,773.3 billion yuan.  Income
gaps between provinces are widening.  The coastal areas of Shanghai and
Guangdong had per capita incomes of $800 in 1992, versus $225 in Guizhou.
There are about 230 million residents in the rich southeast coastal area, and
530 million in the poorer center.<p>
China classifies its urban households into five categories, from the poorest,
who have annual incomes of less than 5,000 yuan ($600) and who comprise eight
percent of households, to the next group--who have annual incomes between 5,000
and 15,000 yuan ($600-$1,800)--and who comprise 30 percent of urban households,
to the 53 percent of all urban households that have annual incomes between
15,000-30,000 yuan ($1,800-$3,600), to the high income households that have
annual incomes of 30,000 to 100,000 yuan ($3,600-$12,000)--who are six percent
of all households, to the very high income households, who have more than
100,000 yuan annually ($12,000)--and are three percent of all households.<p>
About one-fourth of China's 1.2 billion people are considered urban residents.
<p>
There are believed to be about 35 million ethnic Chinese outside mainland
China, or 55 million if Taiwan is included.  These overseas ethnic Chinese are
believed to account for some 70 percent of the more than $ 490 billion in
foreign investments in mainland China.  Overseas Chinese have been described as
"Lords of the Rim: The Invisible Empire of the Overseas Chinese," and "The
Merchant Mandarins."<p>
China elaborated on plans announced earlier to "preserve jobs in China for the
Chinese."  Urban unemployment is estimated to be at least 10 percent, far
higher than the three percent official rate.<p>
The US Human Rights Report on China, issued in March 1996, notes that there is
a "floating population" of over 100 million economic migrants within China.
China also responded to US charges that it is swamping Tibet with Chinese
immigrants by arguing that, in 1995, there were 79,000 Chinese Han people among
Tibet's 2.4 million residents.<p>
In the US, the 98 Chinese Golden Venture passengers still in detention may be
able to apply for political asylum in the U.S after the House approved a
House-Senate conference report that would amend the Immigration and Nationality
Act to allow people who fear "coercive population controls" in their home
country to seek asylum in the U.S.  <p>
Vietnam announced in March that there are 2.6 million ethnic Vietnamese in 80
countries, including one million in the US, about 400,000 in France, 300,000 in
China, 160,000 in Australia, 150,000 in Canada, 120,000 in Thailand and 100,000
each in Germany, Cambodia and Russia.<p>

<a name="RTFToC21">Thailand</a>:
 Foreign Worker</a>
Zones</a>
</a></h2>
The Federation of Thai Industries proposed the creation of a special economic
zone which would allow foreigners to work without a minimum wage requirement.
One zone being considered is for the provinces near the borders of Cambodia and
Myanmar.  <p>
The proposal would also allow foreigners full ownership in businesses in the
zone.  Current rules allow foreigners to own no more than 40 percent of an
enterprise.  Most products produced in the special economic zone would be for
export. <p>
The Thai House committee on military affairs believes that the presence of over
two million illegal foreign workers in the country poses a security threat.
Most of the foreign workers are from Myanmar (formerly Burma); the committee
spokesperson asserts they are sent to act as spies in Thailand.<p>
On March 20, the Thai House of Representatives considered a proposal to allow
foreign workers to work on Thai fishing vessels.  The bill is aimed at
alleviating a shortage of crewmen on fishing boats.  Many of the workers come
from Myanmar (Burma) or Cambodia. <p>
After five Thai workers were executed for murder and robbery in Singapore in
mid-March, the Thai justice ministry is considering posting legal advisors
abroad to protect Thai overseas workers.  The reaction to the killings in
Thailand was muted, although the government was criticized for not protecting
overseas workers.  Press reports initially expected a furor similar to that
when the Singapore government executed a Filipino maid last year. <p>

 Too Many
Foreign</a><a></a>ers?</a>
</a></h2>
Indonesia, the world's fourth most populous nation with a labor force growing
by almost two million per year, is worried that too many "good jobs" are going
to foreigners.  In 1995, the number of foreign workers increased 38 percent, to
57,000.<p>
Most foreigners in Indonesia are professional expatriates who earn $4,000 per
month or more.  The government reports that expatriate workers in 1995 earned a
total $2.4 billion, equivalent to one-third of the country's current account
deficit of $7.9 billion.  <p>
There are over 11,000 South Koreans working in Indonesia, 9,000 Japanese and
5,000 Taiwanese.  Currently, Indonesian companies can only hire foreign workers
for jobs requiring professional skills not possessed by locals.  On March 23,
the government announced plans to allow foreigners to work in positions which
have previously been closed to them such as high and middle-level management.
The government hopes that the new, shorter list will attract more foreign
investment in Indonesia. <p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC23">ILO
Report on Migrant
Workers</a><a></a></h2>
The International Labour Office in Geneva released a report on March 6 about
the deteriorating working conditions of migrant workers in East Asia and the
Middle East. <p>
The report was released at a meeting of government officials, employers and
trade unions from more than 30 countries who met at the ILO's Geneva
headquarters the week of March 4 to discuss international labor standards for
construction workers.  During the meeting, the representatives discussed how
the government of labor-sending countries can protect their overseas workers.
Labor importing countries were accused of failing to enforce their labor laws
regarding migrant workers. <p>
In the report, the ILO found that the wages and benefits of foreign workers are
typically below those paid to local workers.  In Bahrain, for example, wages
for construction workers fell by as much as one third between 1986 and 1989.<p>
The ILO report found that wages vary considerably.  A survey of wages paid by
Korean construction firms in the Middle East in 1992 revealed, for example,
that Malaysians earned the most, US$536 per month, followed by Filipinos and
Thais.  At the bottom of the scale were Sri Lankans, at US$38 per month.  Wages
for foreign construction workers are higher in Asia than the Middle East.<p>
The failure of many countries to recognize their dependence on foreign workers
has led to many migrants working illegally, and thus they do not complain of
safety violations.  <p>
A survey of Asia in the Economist assumes that labor shortages throughout the
region will have some inflationary effect, and that continued labor shortages
will act as brake on economic growth.  The article concludes that the companies
that succeed in Asia on a large scale will be those that can build their own
infrastructure and distribution systems and recruit and retain the best
employees.  <p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC25">Israel</a>
Replaces
Palestinians</a>/a></a></h2>
After a three-week ban on Palestinians entering Israel due to a series of
suicide bombings, the government announced on March 24 that it was easing its
closure of the West Bank and Gaza.  <p>
Only Palestinians working in Jewish settlements in the territories will be able
to return to their jobs, and Palestinian patients will be allowed to seek
treatment in Israeli hospitals.  However, most Palestinians will continue to be
indefinitely barred from their jobs in Israel. <p>
During the periodic bans on Palestinian workers over the past year, Thai,
Romanian and Chinese workers were brought in to work in the fields and
construction sites throughout Israel.  More than 60,000 Palestinians are
authorized to work in Israel, and about 40,000 more work in Israel illegally.
<p>
In mid-March, the Israeli government approved the admission of 16,500 new
foreign workers to replace the banned Palestinian workers, bringing the total
to 90,000 legal workers and another 50,000 to 100,000 illegal foreign
workers.<p>
On March 19, the first of the new foreign workers were flown in from Thailand.
The 238 farm laborers will pick oranges, vegetables and flowers. <p>
With nearly one in ten worker a non-Israeli, the country's labor minister
warned that if the number of foreign workers continues to increase, Israel will
experience some of the same problems facing western Europe.  An immigration
absorption expert from Tel Aviv University predicted that, if foreign workers
eventually bring their families, there may be a xenophobic reaction.  <p>
Some foreign workers in Israel live in poor conditions, often without water or
adequate sanitation.  The city of Raanana, north of Tel Aviv, issued a ban in
March on renting housing to foreign workers. <p>
Most foreign workers are recruited in their home countries by Israeli
intermediaries and are paid less than the legal minimum wage--about $600 per
month compared with $1,500 per month.  Most foreigners have one-year work
contracts.  <p>
In 1995, foreign workers remitted about $470 million to their countries of
origin.  <p>
The West Bank and Gaza depend on the Israeli economy for jobs and sales--Israel
puts the daily dependence at $2 million per day, the Palestinians at $3 million
per day in wages and jobs, and another $6 million in indirect sales that result
from the expenditure of wages earned in Israel.<p>
Israel's economy is about 30 times that of the West Bank and Gaza, and until
recently about one-fourth of the Palestinian labor force of 280,000 worked in
Israel, usually in construction for about $35 per day.<p>
Palestinian officials said on March 24 that they are trying to establish
worldwide trade accords to lessen the area's dependence upon Israel.  A
Palestinian delegation is planning to negotiate trade accords with other Arab

The US has agreed to provide $110 million worth of equipment to help Israel
build and monitor a 124-mile fence to separate the West Bank from Israel.   The
fence is designed to prevent terrorism and "illegal immigration" from the
territory controlled by the Palestinian authority.<p>
Israel has received about 700,000 immigrants from the former Soviet Union since
1989.  Per capita income reached $15,500 in 1995 -- equal to that of Spain,
Ireland and New Zealand.<p>

in New Zealand
Elections</a></a</a></h2>
The head of the New Zealand First Party proposed on February 21 that immigrants
have a four-year probationary period to prove their commitment to the country.
Immigrant residents would be restricted to 24.9 percent ownership of New
Zealand companies, and would not be allowed to buy land, other than that on
which their home and business are sited.  <p>
First Party leader Winston Peters said that New Zealand wanted immigrants who
were committed to the country, and would make a contribution to New Zealand,
but not wealthy people who would spend most of their time overseas.  New
Zealand first has only 3 seats in the 99 person Parliament, but 17 percent
support in opinion polls.<p>
The Labour Party leader criticized Peters for his anti-immigrant views but
blamed the government for creating the climate for such sentiment.  The
government, she said, has allowed in sharp increase in immigration without
being prepared for the influx.<p>
Some Maoris fear that wealthy Asians settling in New Zealand will purchase much
of the country, jeopardizing tribal land settlement that dates back to European
colonization last century. <p>
A recent survey found that 51 percent of the voters believe New Zealand has too
many Asians, even though they make up less than 0.5 percent of its 3.5 million
people. <p>
