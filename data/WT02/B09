<p align=center><strong>&quot;HENRY GEORGE AND TAX COMMISSIONS: A CRITICAL EVALUATION OF THE ONTARIO 
FAIR TAX COMMISSION.&quot;</strong></p>
<p>After the expenditure of approximately $8.5 million and deliberations spanning several years, the Ontario Fair Tax 
Commission (FTC) issued its final Report entitled &quot;Fair Taxation in a Changing World&quot; in December, 1993.</p>
<p>The Report measures over 1100 pages and is supported by a large number of research papers and working group 
reports.</p>
<p>Georgist organizations in Ontario made four presentations to the Commission in London, Peterborough, Ottawa 
and Toronto. An extensive Report on the property tax base in Peterborough was filed with the Commission along 
with other supporting documentation with respect to land value taxation and the implementation of a two tier 
approach to local property taxation.. </p>
<p>In its final Report the Commission devoted less than two pages to &quot;Two-Tier Assessment&quot;. The approach was 
rejected on the grounds that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;We do not view the tax system as an appropriate planning tool.&quot; (page 699)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Furthermore the Commission maintained that: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;two-tier assessment and taxation would exaggerate the one characteristic of market value 
assessment that is most undesirable from a benefit tax perspective - the value measured includes 
values attributable to future uses of the property and future potential capital gains. Because the 
locational attributes that give rise both to potential future uses and to increases in value in excess of 
inflation attach to land rather than to buildings two-tier assessment and taxation would increase the 
weight given to these non-use related values.&quot; (pages 699-700). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This paper explores the reasons why a reasonably well-informed and research-supported tax commission like the 
FTC could so thoroughly misjudge and misinterpret a proposal like converting an undifferentiated mill rate on the 
total estimated market value of real property to a differentiated mill rate on the building and land components. 
These reasons are complex and interrelated. They are both institutional and historical and connect with a 
considerable array of social, economic, legal and professional interests. </p>
<p>The first stage of coming to grips with why the tax proposals of Henry George are generally not incorporated into 
the deliberations of modern tax commissions is to identify comprehensively the conventions which govern tax 
economics. </p>
<ol>
<li>Tax authorities are transaction-seekers. Most tax systems are transaction-based. </li>
<li>Transactions are thought to be an indicator of &quot;capacity&quot; to pay taxes. Tax systems are thus based on 
perceptions which are indicia of horizontal and vertical equities. </li>
<li>Taxes are primarily in personam, i.e., related to personal capacity. This is equally true of the taxation of 
corporate profits since tax incidence studies trace the ultimate burden of the tax to wage-earners, consumers 
or the owners of capital. In other words it is assumed only individuals pay taxes. Hence the fundamental 
prejudice in tax economies against the Georgist separation of the taxation of the natural resource and the 
taxable capacity of the person who utilizes that resource. </li>
<li>Modern tax systems are to a substantial degree &quot;rent-seeking&quot;, i.e., there is a continuous appropriation by 
nonproducers of producers. Only producers are assumed to have ability to pay, the &quot;fairness&quot; of the tax 
system residing in its limning of the degree or magnitude of ability to pay. </li>
<li>The tax system is fundamentally objective, quantitative and neutral. &quot;A buck is a buck is a buck&quot; was the 
nostrum of the Carter Royal Commission on Taxation in the 1960's and this assumption has prevailed in 
subsequent tax commissions. This is at odds with George's categorization of income, primarily as earned and 
unearned increments. </li>
<li>Given the diversity in taxable capacity amongst individuals there must be a &quot;tax mix&quot; or a &quot;tax mosaic&quot; in 
order to ensure that the horizontal and vertical equities are approached, if not achieved. Some mixture of 
progressive and regressive taxation (eg. progressive income and regressive sales taxes) is acceptable in 
order to achieve varying tax objectives related to tax avoidance, taking resources out of the community, 
reducing economic distortion, and so on. </li>
<li>The redistributive justice issues embedded in 20th century tax systems are ex post facto. i.e., remedial 
attempts to correct fundamental maldistributions of property and income. George's &quot;sovereign remedy&quot; is 
primarily preventative, i.e., it seeks to correct injustice in the distribution of property and income and only 
then can one assume that there will be justice in taxation. </li>
<li>Modern tax systems capitalize the active and passive factors of production, treating all transactions related 
thereto and all income dependant thereon indiscriminately. Tax systems although based on personal taxable 
capacity are thus buttressed by concepts that are transpersonal, translocal and transnational. Georgist tax 
reforms are in one sense highly localized and immobile and yet have implications that go well beyond any 
currently existing taxing jurisdiction. Georgist reforms force more re-localization, eg. negate absentee 
landlordism and discourage underutilization of urban land resources. Owners of land will thus be less 
separated from the utilizers of nature. </li>
<li>exhaustive and encompasses of all forms of taxation. The categorization and evaluation of income and 
expenditure in relation to labour and capital is therefore the only operational task in determining tax liability. 
The modern tax system is thus infinitely diversified and diversifiable. This protects both the integrity of the 
system and makes it highly adaptable in a changing and complex economy. Collection of economic rent 
appears monolithic and dated since it tends to undermine the difficulties in identifying this rent and 
appropriating it for the state. The absence of income does not relieve tax liability in the Georgist system. 
Asset rich and income poor owners have a more viscerable attachment to their property than 
income-earners who take their property in the fungible form of money. Hence the perceived intrusive nature 
of the Georgist reforms. They appear less calibrated to individual circumstances than modern income and 
commodities tax systems. </li>
</ol>
<p>The Ontario Fair Tax Commission accepted without critical evaluation the primary conventions of modern tax 
economics. It attempted to roll back the so-called &quot;crisis in progressive taxation&quot; that was endemic in many 
industrialized countries in the 1980's. But this perceived crisis in taxation based on a graduated ability-to-pay basis 
was not a result of deeper reflections on the nature of in rem and in personam taxation or how the tax system may 
collect unearned increments related to economic rent or how taxing authorities may even more accurately 
distinguish between economic rents and the income of producers. </p>
<p>Vertical and horizontal equity is now being more critically examined. A more predominating concept has been &quot;tax 
neutrality&quot;. Neutrality was one of the primary grounds for the introduction of a value-added tax in Canada. The 
most neutral of all taxes is of course the land value tax. </p>
<p>If the Georgist reforms are to play a more prominent role in tax commissions, then its advocates have to become 
adept at identifying controversies in the conventional academic literature on tax economics and demonstrate how 
George's economic philosophy addresses these issues.</p>

<p align=center><strong>CONFERENCE ON PROPERTY TAX REFORM<br>
MISSISSAUGA, ONTARIO<br>
JUNE 27, and 28, 1993</strong></p>
<p>In these times of tax revolts, ratepayer anger, federal and provincial downloading, cutbacks and layoffs, the 
Canadian adherents to the philosophy of economics espoused by Henry George recently sponsored a Conference 
on Property Tax Reform.</p>
<p>Since Ontario relies more on property tax than any other province and since the property tax in Ontario raises 
more revenue than any other single tax, apart from personal income tax, it is important that the property tax work 
for the taxpayers and not against them.</p>
<p>Guest speaker on Sunday June 27, 1993 was Mr. Ted Gwartney. He was Director of the British Columbia 
Assessment Authority from 1973 to 1986. During his term as Assessment Commissioner he was successful in 
implementing a province-wide reassessment of all real estate, over 1.2 million parcels, and for creating a database 
which allows the annual reassessment of all real estate values. Annual updating of assessments is less expensive 
than the system currently used in Ontario.</p>
<p>Canadian Georgists believe that the present property tax should be reformed so that there is a differential mill rate 
on the land and building component of the total real estate assessment. When a greater proportion of revenue 
comes from the land component it tends to stabilize land values by limiting rapid changes in land prices.</p>
<p>Ontario is one of the few assessment jurisdictions that does not show separate land and building assessments on its 
Notices of Assessment.</p>
<p>Mr. Gwartney was able to reduce the staff complement and assessment costs by 25% in British Columbia by 
adopting innovative methods including an on-line computer system for the 1,250,000 land parcels. The calibre of 
the assessments continue to be considered the foremost in the world and are used by banks and real estate agents 
for benchmark values in their appraisals.</p>
<p>Mr. Gwartney has made six trips to Russia to give training seminars on land assessment. He has prepared a land 
assessment manual that describes five methods for assessing land values even when there has been no market 
evidence for seventy years.</p>
<p>The Russian Municipal Association, which is comprised of the 100 largest cities in Russia has adopted land value 
taxes as the primary source of local revenue.</p>
<p>Russia is considering the use of site value taxation to fund the clean up of environmental pollution. With its skilled 
assessment staff, Ontario can facilitate a similar site value (two tier property tax) system on very short notice.</p>
<p>Novgorod (population 340,000), the original capital city of Russia, plans to raise all public revenue from land value 
taxes to fund municipal services and schools. They also plan to rebate to their citizens all income and sales taxes 
paid to the federal government.</p>
<p>Mr. Frank Peddle (Ottawa) announced to the Conference that the Ottawa-Carleton Region is requesting a Two 
Tier Property Tax impact study during the next reassessment cycle, which would bring the base year to 1992. The 
City of Peterborough has had a long standing request for a Two Tier Property Tax pilot project but cannot get the 
provincial government to introduce enabling legislation to implement its study.</p>
<p>On Monday June 28, 1993 Jean Smith (Toronto) and Ted Gwartney appeared before the Ontario Fair Tax 
Commission.</p>
<p>In addition to information above it was pointed out to the Commission that the tax on the land value portion of the 
property tax is more progressive than the income tax because in all municipalities land ownership (land value) is 
more concentrated than income ownership, and the land value reflects more community created value while the 
building component reflects better the individual's ability to pay.</p>
<p>It appears improvements to Ontario's assessments are not only needed to bring the system into the 21st century 
but it is possible to achieve these improvements and still save tax dollars.</p>
<p>A question asked at the beginning of the Conference was &quot;Can Ontario move toward genuine property tax reform 
and will the Fair Tax Commission meet the challenge?&quot; The question is still unanswered.</p>

<p align=center><strong>CONFERENCE ON PROPERTY TAX REFORM<br>
MISSISSAUGA, ONTARIO<br>
JUNE 27, and 28, 1993</strong></p>
<p>Canadian Georgists are now organizing themselves for the coming battle on Property Tax Reform.</p>
<p>At the opening session of the Canadian Georgist Conference a brief background of each sponsoring organization 
was given with the Canadian Council of Georgist Organizations being adopted as the collective name.</p>
<p>Henry George Foundation of Canada - The Foundation dates from 1930 when Ernest Farmer and Arthur 
Roebuck established a fund for political and educational activities. The current President is Peter Vanmeggalen, 
while Jack Bea is the Treasurer.</p>
<p>Oscar Boelens Foundation - This Foundation dates from 1964 when Oscar Boelens donated his estate to 
perpetuate the ideas of Henry George. The Chairman is Ben Sevack, Harry Payne is Secretary-Treasurer and Leo 
Klag is a director.</p>
<p>School of Economic Science - The School was established in 1939. It was most active in the 60's and 70's when 
numerous classes were taught in the Toronto area. Acting Director is John Fisher.</p>
<p>Canadian Research Committee on Taxation - The Committee has produced numerous briefs to various levels of 
government on tax matters. Research Director is Frank Peddle, who is currently preparing for publication a 
comprehensive study of land value taxation in Canada.</p>
<p>Peterborough (Mal McCarthy) and Rodney (John Fisher) Two-Tier Property Tax Committees - Both Committees 
have produced Two Tier Studies. Mal described the beginnings through the Kiwanis Club and his successful 
efforts to get city council backing for a Two Tier pilot study.</p>
<p>The beginnings of a Canadian Council of Georgist Organizations may develop as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>HENRY GEORGE FOUNDATION	</li>
<li>OSCAR BOELENS FOUNDATION OF CANADA </li>
<li>FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO REGISTERED CHARITIES</li>
<li>SCHOOL OF ECONOMIC SCIENCE</li>
<li>CANADIAN RESEARCH COMMITTEE ON TAXATION </li>
<li>TWO TIER PROPERTY TAX COMMITTEES </li>
</ul>
<p>Frank Peddle reported that three independent Ottawa groups addressed the Fair Tax Commission on the Two 
Tier Property Tax issue. These organizations are</p>
<ol>
<li>Citizens for Fair Taxes - Chairman Frank Spink, </li>
<li>Coalition for Fair Municipal Taxes - Chairman Gerry LePage and </li>
<li>Action Sandy Hill - Bob Edmonds </li>
</ol>
<p>Letters of support were received from Mary Rawson member of the Vancouver Planning Board, Vancouver, B.C. 
and Bob Clancy, Henry George Institute, New York.</p>
<p>Mr. Seth Rudin attended the Conference on behalf of the Ontario Liberal Party.</p>
<p>A long time Georgist and friend Craig Cringan (Mississauga) was remembered and recognized as contributing 
much to the fight for meaningful tax reform.</p>
<p>The Monday morning hearing at the Fair Tax Commission went very well (see notes on Ted Gwartney and Jean 
Smith). Ted and Jean made an impressive presentation but were the four panelists listening? We will know later this 
year when the final report is available!</p>
<p>Although only 14 people attended the Conference, good ideas were exchanged, focus and direction were 
strengthened, valuable contacts were made (including the Fair Tax Commission) beyond the group. The Two Tier 
Property Tax philosophy was given collective support as the best alternative in the search for property tax reform 
because it combines social justice and incentive for economic growth.</p>

<hr>
<p align=center><strong>HENRY GEORGE, TAX REFORM AND THE CANADIAN ECONOMY</strong></p>
<p>From June 17 to 22 the Council of Georgist Organizations held its annual meeting in Santo Domingo, Dominican 
Republic. The conference was organized by the Henry George School of Social Science of Santo Domingo. The 
energetic and much-loved, Lucy Silfa, the founder and director of the School, hosted the gathering of economists, 
tax experts and scholars. Ben Sevack of Montreal attended in his capacity as President of the Canadian Research 
Committee on Taxation and represented Canada along with the writer.<br>
</p>
<p>Why would representatives from the United States, Argentina, the Cayman Islands, Canada and the Dominican 
Republic itself meet to discuss as a matter of vital contemporary concern the little known works of the 
nineteenth-century American philosopher and economist Henry George? The answer lies in recognizing the cause 
of the malaise that is currently gripping the political, economic and social institutions of societies around the world 
and in the studied inability of these institutions to account in a convincing way for the problems they perpetrate. 
These institutions systematically discourage what is beneficial to the community while subsidizing and rewarding the 
unproductive and environmental degradation.<br>
</p>
<p>There is a tendency today to link intuitively the global and the competitive. On the other hand, seldom are the 
reasons for the current worldwide economic downturn universalized so that the distortions of economic life which 
make it possible and profitable to grow bananas in Scotland are not unlike the distortions of the property tax in 
Montreal which contribute to urban blight, unaffordable housing and the wasteful subsidization of land speculation. 
It is primarily the structure of taxation not necessarily its level which impedes economic life.<br>
Henry George's fundamental theme in his well known Progress and Poverty, and in other works such as Social 
Problems, Protection or Free Trade, and the Science of Political Economy is that the burden of running society 
should fall the least upon those activities that are beneficial to the well-being of the community and more on those 
activities that are a detriment to social and economic betterment.<br>
</p>
<p>What does this philosophy mean in practice? A good example would be the current efforts of Georgist 
organizations in Canada to promote meaningful and genuine reform to a system of taxation that has become in all its 
prosaic complexity a tremendous burden on the Canadian economy and indeed on the spirit of the nation.<br>
The two tier or two rate method of property taxation, advocated by some Georgist organizations such as the 
Peterborough, Ontario Two Tier Property Tax Committee in its Report of January, 1992, lowers the tax burden 
on buildings and improvements. The trade-off is that revenue from holding land idle and underutilized is increased. 
The tax system is thus adjusted to give those who are contributing constructively to the community a break. High 
housing costs, land speculation, costly urban sprawl and the overall deterioration of our cities are some of the 
negatives ameliorated by this tax. Fairness in taxation is not simply a matter of promoting greater equity, it must be 
a matter of structuring taxes so as to reduce social overhead costs while at the same time creating more wealth for 
all to share less unequally.<br>
</p>
<p>Henry George is not only the inspiration for equitable land reform and economic advancement in impoverished 
countries like the Dominican Republic. Canada and the U.S. are becoming more and more impoverished and 
polarized primarily because the counter-productive tax and expenditure policies of the government work 
incrementally to undermine the social, economic and psychological fabric upon which the liberal democracies were 
founded. There is a cruel irony here for traditional liberals. Progressive social programs do not achieve their 
objectives because the revenue engine created to fund them exacerbates the conditions which necessitate the 
programs. Hence the current downward spiral of increasing expenditures achieving less and less social justice and 
increasing taxes requiring greater social expenditures.<br>
</p>
<p>It is the knowledge that there are viable, and yet generally unknown, alternatives to the current malaise that brought 
participants in the various Georgist organizations together in Santo Domingo. George's life and work encompass 
abiding insights into human nature and socio-economic relations. The non-profit Georgist research organizations, 
their paid professionals and volunteers, work diligently to undertake and promote research into the detailed 
economic application of Georgist principles to modern economic circumstances. The result has been a diverse yet 
coherent and still growing body of research that is beginning to have a wide-ranging influence in academic, 
governmental and business circles.<br>
</p>
<p>While in Santo Domingo, a delegation from the Georgist organizations met with President Joachim Balaguer, who 
was a student of the Georgist philosophy while in exile in the U.S. in the 1960s. The Dominican Republic, like 
many other countries, is burdened with an immense foreign debt, increasing poverty and malnutrition, and the 
continual decay of basic infrastructure. The persistent interruption of electrical power in Santo Domingo is just one 
of the more visible hardships. Land and tax reforms on the Georgist model in the Dominican Republic will be 
difficult on account of the concentration of landownership among 35 or 40 families. Everyone was enthusiastic that 
a reform would finally be undertaken which would result in real change for the 7 million citizens of the Dominican 
Republic. How long can the institutions of the status quo hold out against a philosophy of economics that is a 
theoretical and practical answer to the same detrimental policies that have strangled such seemingly different 
economies as those of Canada and the Dominican Republic?</p>

<HR>
<H4>OBJECTIVES OF THE CANADIAN RESEARCH COMMITTEE ON TAXATION</H>
<P>Taxation plays a fundamental and pervasive role in society. Throughout history excessive levels of taxation and the confiscation of individual property by both democratic and totalitarian governments have invariably led to a decline in the productive capacity of societies and brought to a halt social progress.
By unnecessarily burdening individual labour and initiative, current tax policy in Canada is unfortunately repeating a pattern that is all too evident in history. The federal, provincial and local governments all proclaim that they have as their objectives the containment of inflation, the lowering of interest rates, the enhancement of Canada's competitive position internationally, and the maintenance of a social safety net. Their tax policies on the other hand create inflation, keep interest rates high, make us uncompetitive internationally and add to the number of people living below the poverty line. The Canadian Research Committee on Taxation (CRCT) does research on alternative tax policies which prevent governments from continually working against themselves.
The primary objective of the CRCT is to demonstrate that it is possible to reverse the seemingly inevitable trends towards ever increasing levels of direct and indirect taxation on personal incomes and towards the diminishing ability of our society to produce the things it needs the most such as affordable housing, efficient public transportation and clean environments.</P>
CRCT is able to assist tax reform groups develop a different approach to tax issues. In order to carry out its purposes and objectives, the CRCT is conducting a systematic program of research in the fields of taxation and fiscal policy by:
<UL>
 <LI>elaborating the fundamental principles which underlie just, fair, equitable and efficient methods of taxation;
<LI>designing tax systems for individuals, business enterprises and municipalities which meet the tests of fairness, simplicity and economic efficiency;
<LI>studying the various methods and types of taxation at all levels of government in order to evaluate their cumulative effect.
</UL>
<H4>PRINCIPLES</H4>
<P>The guiding principle for research conducted by the CRCT is that a fair and sound method of taxation should infringe as little as possible upon individual liberty and effort. Equally, it is necessary that methods of taxation be devised which do not negate, as do current forms of taxation, the productive capacity of our economy or subsidize environmentally detrimental practices.</P>
<P>Tax experts generally focus on either the ability-to-pay or the cost-benefit approaches. The objectives of tax reform are often said to be equity, efficiency, simplicity and stability. The CRCT has integrated these various approaches and objectives into one coherent and comprehensive tax philosophy. Future tax reforms will have to meet the tests of both the ability-to-pay and cost-benefit concepts. The CRCT is of the view that genuine tax reform is not achievable unless impartial research is conducted into methods of taxation which take into account the ability-to-pay and cost-benefit approaches as complementary and interdependent aspects of any tax.</P>
<P>The unifying principle of ability to pay in proportion to benefits received is the basis for the CRCT's research into devising taxes which have the following fundamental characteristics:</P>
<UL>
<LI>bear as lightly as possible upon productive, environmentally sound and socially beneficial activity;
<LI>bear equally on all citizens so to neither advantage nor disadvantage anyone as compared with others;
<LI>be certain, not arbitrary - reliable, simple and easily understood;
<LI>be cheaply and efficiently collected and administered.
</UL>
<P>The Canadian tax system at all levels of government violates the basic tenets of a sound program of public revenue generation. For example, municipal property taxes on total property values penalize improvements to buildings, subsidize land speculation, and inflate housing costs. Complex taxes on the net income of business enterprises, and arbitrary sales and excise taxes, further add to inflation and interest rates, which in turn make the economy more uncompetitive and lower the standard of living for everyone.</P>
<H4>PROGRAMS</H4>
<P>In order to contribute to the development of tax policies which provide constructive alternatives to the current negative systems of taxation, the CRCT has structured a research program which has three main components:</P>
<UL>
 <LI>replacement of current municipal taxes on buildings and businesses by a two tier property tax in which there would be a higher mill rate on land or site values rather than on the improvements to the site;
<LI>replacement of all sales taxes, and of taxes on the net income of businesses, by a business earnings tax, whereby business enterprises would be taxed on that portion of their earnings or income which is equivalent to their costs of production;
<LI>replacement of the current personal income tax system by a simple proportional income tax which would eliminate most forms of preferential tax treatment and substitute a personal exemption that is above the poverty line for all individuals and families.
</UL>
<P>These three components of the CRCT's research program constitute a progressive framework for genuine tax reform. By interrelating ability to pay and cost benefit in the design of appropriate methods of taxation for cities, business enterprises and individuals, special privileges and benefits embedded in the present tax system in Canada will be greatly reduced. At the same time, community- and government-created values will be recaptured by the public treasury for the further provision of social goods and services.</P>
<P>The CRCT actively encourages other research organizations as well as community groups and individuals to conduct their own research and analysis into the effects of making structural changes to the current tax system on the basis of the general principle of interrelating the ability-to-pay and cost-benefit concepts. For instance, the CRCT is willing to assist municipalities in analyzing the tax and economic impact of levying differential mill rates on land and buildings. Such studies can show the degree to which a simple change in the property tax system - downtaxing buildings and uptaxing site values - results in positive effects on business investment, employment and the provision of affordable housing in municipal tax jurisdictions.</P>
<H4>COURSES</H4>
<P>In affiliation with other research organizations in Canada and the United States, the CANADIAN RESEARCH COMMITTEE on TAXATION offers courses and seminars on a wide range of topics in taxation and tax-related fields in economics, public finance, philosophy and political economy.

<BR>by Francis K. Peddle, Ph.D.</H1><BR CLEAR=left>
<HR>
<H4>COUNTERPRODUCTIVE TAXATION</H4>
<P>CITIES AND GREED is an easily comprehensible examination of the assessment and taxation of the building and land components of real estate in Canadian municipalities. Ottawa lawyer Francis K. Peddle exposes the damaging economic and social effects of the indiscriminate taxation of both buildings and land as the primary source of revenue for local government. Dr. Peddle shows how the many negative influences currently embedded in the local property tax can be alleviated by simultaneously lowering the tax or mill rate on the building component of the real estate tax and proportionately increasing the rate on the land value component.</P>
<HR>
<H4>URBAN ECONOMICS</H4>
<P>This book examines the interlocking problems which pervade our urban economies and systems of municipal property taxation. The principal proposal of the book, which would see the current system of property taxation replaced by a site value system of taxation, or what is now often called, especially in the United States, a two tier property tax, has been long advocated by tax reform groups, urban economists and others who are dismayed at how real estate speculation and the monopolization of community-created wealth negatively affects our economies.</P>
<HR>
<H4>CONTENTS</H4>
<P>CITIES AND GREED analyzes in depth how the current property tax discourages improvements to properties, encourages land speculation and increases land costs, contributes to urban blight and thwarts urban renewal, results in environmentally destructive urban sprawl, raises municipal costs and abets the housing shortage and inadequate housing. The issues of fairness and equity in taxation are addressed as well as the distorting effect of the current property tax on property rights and urban planning. The book connects cycles in real estate speculation with unemployment, inflation and declining productivity.</P>
<P>CITIES AND GREED evaluates the basic principles which should govern any system of taxation as they have developed in the history of economics. The positive effect of land value taxation is surveyed as it has been variously implemented around the world. There is also a chapter on the history and practice of land value taxation in Canada during the twentieth century.</P>
<HR>
<H4>TAX REVOLT</H4>
<P>There is now a pervasive and profound tax revolt going on in Canada that is aimed at the tax policies of all levels of government. What form this revolt will take in the coming years is anybody's guess, but there is no doubt it will intensify. This publication shows readers that there are viable and constructive alternatives to the current tax.</P>
<HR>
<H4>CANADIAN RESEARCH COMMITTEE ON TAXATION</H4>
<P>Taxation plays a fundamental and pervasive role in society. Throughout history excessive levels of taxation and the confiscation of individual property by both democratic and totalitarian governments have invariably led to a decline in the productive capacity of society and brought to a halt social progress. Not infrequently the end result of arbitrary and punitive forms of taxation is social turmoil and revolution.</P>

<P>By unnecessarily burdening individual labour and initiative, current tax policy in Canada is unfortunately repeating a pattern that is all too evident in history. The federal, provincial and local governments all proclaim that they have as their objectives the containment of inflation, the lowering of interest rates, the enhancement of Canada's competitive position internationally, and extending a helping hand to the needy. Their tax policies on the other hand create inflation, keep interest rates high, make us uncompetitive internationally and add to the number of people living below the poverty line.</P>

<P>The Canadian Research Committee on Taxation does research on alternative tax policies which prevent governments from continually working against themselves.</P>

<P>The primary objective of the CRCT is to demonstrate that it is possible to reverse the seemingly inevitable trends towards ever increasing levels of direct and indirect taxation on personal incomes and towards the diminishing ability of our society to produce the things it needs the most such as affordable housing, efficient public transportation and clean urban environments.</P>

<H2><IMG ALIGN="left" width="150" height="198" ALT="[Example Image]" SRC="taxcomm.gif" >HENRY GEORGE AND THE END OF TAX COMMISSIONS<BR>An Evaluation of the Report of the
Ontario Fair Tax Commissions
<BR>by Francis K. Peddle, Ph.D.</H2><BR CLEAR=left>
<HR>
<HR>
<H4>CRITIQUE OF TAX COMMISSIONS</H4>
<P>Tax commissions are often the source of key policy recommendations with respect to the design of our system of public finance. HENRY GEORGE AND THE END OF TAX COMMISSIONS explores the prevailing economic, social and political assumptions which guide modern day tax commissions. This critical evaluation, by Ottawa lawyer and writer Francis K. Peddle, focuses on tax philosophy and principles. It illustrates the frequent misapplication of tax principles as well as their often contradictory and inconsistent juxtaposition. The particular analysis in this book has relevance for all tax commissions.</P>
<HR>
<H4>ONTARIO FAIR TAX COMMISSION</H4>
<P>In December, 1993 the Ontario Fair Tax Commission issued its final Report entitled Fair Taxation in a Changing World. The Report was the first major review of the tax system in Ontario in 25 years. The Fair Tax Commission spent $8.6 million and conducted an extensive consultation program with the public. It also confidently persuaded itself that its Report would form the basis of tax policy development well into the future. Although the Report feigns objectivity, its recommendations are driven by political ideology and are often based on poor and incomplete research. The Report's major recommendation with respect to property taxation would have a highly regressive, unfair and counterproductive effect on the tax system and the economy in Ontario.</P>
<HR>
<H4>CONTENTS</H4>
<P>HENRY GEORGE AND THE END OF TAX COMMISSIONS contains an in depth analysis of the Report of the Fair Tax Commission with a view to exposing many of its incoherent pronouncements on property, income and sales taxation. Part One examines tax principles and looks at the untenable assumptions underlying the "tax mix" philosophy of public revenue generation. The false opposition of sales and income taxes is also discussed. Part Two undertakes a detailed evaluation of the Report and focuses on local government finance. Particular attention is paid to the basis for property assessment in Ontario. Why the Fair Tax Commission choose to avoid recommending two tier property taxation will be of special interest to readers. Part Three deals with property tax appeals and makes some suggestions that are directed at fundamental reform.</P>
<HR>
<H4>CONSTRUCTIVE ALTERNATIVES</H4>
<P>This book relies on the economic philosophy of Henry George to draw its conclusions as to why the work of modern day tax commissions is futile and results in negative consequences with respect to the design of tax systems. A tax system based on the principles of Henry George's economic philosophy moves us towards fairness and justice in the distribution of property and income. In doing so we come closer to fairness and justice in taxation.</P>

<p>Allan Suchinsky, a leading authority in the field of defense
and dual-use trade, has unparalleled experience in counseling
representatives of industry and foreign governments on export
licensing requirements and procedures. Prior to joining CSL
Associates, he served as a Branch Chief at the <a
href="http://www.state.gov/">Department of State</a>&#146;s
Office of Defense Trade Controls (DTC), where he was employed for
over 25 years.</p>
<p>During his tenure at the Department of State, Mr. Suchinsky
supervised over two dozen licensing personnel in the processing
of some 50,000 export license requests per year. He established
policies and procedures for case processing, and hired and
trained most of the licensing officers currently at DTC. He
specialized in assisting industry with the most complex,
time-sensitive licensing scenarios, and the development of
aggressive marketing strategies that adhere to U.S. Government
requirements.</p>
<p>Mr. Suchinsky played an instrumental role in drafting the
current version of the <a href="itar.html">International Traffic
in Arms Regulations (ITAR)</a>, which governs commercial defense
trade. He chaired numerous special interagency studies on the
regulatory process and defense trade policy formulation. He also
represented the Department of State on numerous interagency trade
security working groups and served as DTC&#146;s primary liaison
to the intelligence community.</p>
<p>Mr. Suchinsky was a key participant in numerous high level
negotiations of government-to-government strategic trade and
security agreements. He helped negotiate agreements with many
Asian nations (including the People&#146;s Republic of China),
Australia, Yugoslavia and Brazil. He also held the Department of
State chair on the U.S./Canada Security Subcommittee, and the
National Disclosure Policy Committee.</p>
<p>Mr. Suchinsky is a popular speaker on the regulatory process
and procedures for obtaining timely export approvals. He has also
written numerous articles on defense trade issues and co-authored
a book on the subject.</p>
<p>In 1991, the Electronic Industry Association presented Mr.
Suchinsky with its annual award for outstanding government
performance.</p>
<p>Mr. Suchinsky is a graduate of the State University of New
York at Binghamton, and served in the U.S. Army. He is a member
of the Association of Old Crows, and was previously a member of
the Board of Directors of the Society for International Affairs,
a defense trade educational organization.</p>

        <td valign="top">Every company seeks an edge in
        today&#146;s highly competitive international
        marketplace. Understanding export regulations,
        responsibilities and preferred procedures give companies
        just this kind of advantage. Knowledge yields more timely
        approvals of license requests and the confidence to fully
        pursue international opportunities with minimal
        expenditure of time and valuable resources.
        <p>CSL can help your company in this critical area. We
        conduct intensive in-house seminars and audits to ensure
        that your personnel know how to be fully compliant with
        changing laws while at the same time optimizing
        international business opportunities. </p>
        <p><font color="#000080"><strong>COMPLIANCE</strong></font><br>
        A successful compliance program lies at the heart of
        every efficient export system. Companies cannot afford to
        ignore record keeping and reporting requirements, and the
        potential for government audits. To ignore is to risk
        delays, denials and even fines or debarment. In recent
        years, penalties for violations have been significantly
        reduced for companies that have first-rate compliance
        programs. </p>
        <p>CSL can train your company on-site to bring your
        export programs into compliance. We will work with you to
        design a program that complies with the law, and also
        suits your individual business requirements. Our
        comprehensive Compliance Program meets the requirements
        of the <a href="http://www.state.gov/">Departments of
        State</a> and <a href="http://www.bxa.doc.gov/">Commerce</a>. </p>
        <p><font color="#000080"><strong>EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS</strong></font><br>
        Our tailored educational programs address the needs of
        specific departments and personnel: </p>
        <ul>
            <li><font color="#0000FF">The Executive Program is
                designed to educate upper management about their
                responsibilities and liabilities;</font></li>
            <li><font color="#0000FF">The Marketing Program
                focuses on the responsibilities of your
                front-line sales personnel -- how to sell and, at
                the same time, comply with the rules;</font></li>
            <li><font color="#0000FF">The Foreign Customer
                Program addresses reexport issues and
                documentation requirements of your foreign
                clients.</font></li>
        </ul>
        <p><font color="#000080"><strong>THE CSL SEMINAR</strong></font><br>
        At least once a year CSL Associates conducts an
        interactive, intensive multi-day seminar with limited
        participation. The Seminar focuses on individual
        questions and group participation so attendees get the
        latest information they need to know. Beginners and
        experts alike will both learn from and enjoy sessions on
        export licensing, country and regional policy concerns,
        and compliance. The seminar offers one-on-one sessions
        with CSL experts and government representatives to
        discuss sensitive company issues. </p>
        <p><a href="ibn.html"><font color="#000080"><strong>THE
        CSL NEWSLETTER</strong></font></a><br>
        CSL&#146;s monthly newsletter highlights timely
        developments in the regulatory process, foreign policy
        developments, noteworthy international events, staff
        changes at key government agencies and violations of
        pertinent statutes. </p>
        <p>The CSL education and compliance programs will help
        your company become more confident about complying with
        the regulations, and in the international marketplace. </p>

<p><font color="#000080">CSL Associates was founded in 1986 by
Cecile S. Shure to assist exporters of military and dual use
equipment and technology in their efforts to understand and
comply with the requirements of the U.S. Government. CSL consults
for a wide range of clients, from small computer companies
producing encrypted software to large defense firms manufacturing
jet engines and sophisticated electronics equipment. Several
foreign governments and companies also have sought the advice and
counsel of CSL on their own transfer issues.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">CSL specializes in addressing export
licensing and technology transfer concerns, from application
processing to compliance and training (see enclosures for more
detailed information about our areas of specialization). CSL
works closely with the </font><a href="http://www.state.gov/">Departments
of State</a><font color="#000080">, </font><a
href="http://www.bxa.doc.gov/"><font color="#000080">Commerce</font></a><font
color="#000080">, </font><a href="http://www.dtic.dla.mil/"><font

href="http://www.ustreas.gov/treasury/bureaus/atf/atf.html"><font
color="#000080">Treasury (BATF)</font></a><font color="#000080">
to ensure timely processing of all license requests.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">CSL&#146;s mission is quite simple: to
ensure that our clients receive the best possible advice and
service available, on a cost-effective basis, in pursuit of
international business. </font></p>

<p>CSL Associates provides expert and timely assistance to
companies and foreign governments with day-to-day export
licensing requirements.</p>
<p>Our Licensing services include:</p>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#0000FF">Advising on licensing requirements,
        procedures and policies;</font></li>
    <li><font color="#0000FF">Providing all necessary forms and
        instructions;</font></li>

        color="#0000FF">;</font></li>
    <li><font color="#0000FF">Working with government licensing
        officers to ensure the prompt processing of your
        requests;</font></li>

</ul>
<p>Our licensing system is designed to process your request in
the least amount of time possible. We closely monitor your cases
and work directly with the appropriate government agencies to
stop problems before they occur. At each step in the licensing
process, CSL can save you time and energy: by hand delivering and
picking up licenses we save days in the mail.</p>
<p>CSL will be your licensing advocate. Because of our tracking
capabilities, we note problems that arise during the review
cycle, making calls to or meeting with reviewing agencies to
address their concerns directly. We also prebrief government
officials about complex licensing programs and represent clients
at <a href="http://www.dtic.dla.mil/">Department of Defense</a>
days-in-court and <a href="http://www.state.gov/">Department of
State</a> denial appeal proceedings.</p>
<p>Through the weekly status report, we show exactly where your
licenses are in the system. We can tell you not only that your
license has gone to the <a href="http://www.dtic.dla.mil/">Department
of Defense</a> for review, but the particular branches (<a
href="http://www.army.mil/">Army</a>, <a
href="http://www.navy.mil/">Navy</a>, <a
href="http://www.nsa.gov/">NSA</a>, etc.) that have your case.
Our status report shows you more than where your licenses are in
the system. We keep track of your license expiration dates and
your registration expiration date, and remind you of reporting
requirements for Manufacturing License Agreements and
Distribution Agreements.</p>
<p>In today&#146;s highly competitive international marketplace,
companies cannot afford to be without Washington representation.
Whether CSL becomes your Washington office, or complements the
expertise of your own personnel, we will save you time, energy
and effort.</p>
<p><a name="marketing"><font color="#000080"><strong>MARKETING
ASSISTANCE</strong></font></a></p>

United States and abroad. Our staff continually monitors the
pulse of the international marketplace, on a regional and
country-by-country basis, and will furnish our clients with
expert advice on the prospects of successfully doing business
with specific customers. Our location in Washington, D.C. affords
us easy access to governmental and unofficial sources of critical
advice, counsel and publications in support of marketing efforts.
Our proximity to foreign embassies enables us to supply clients
with timely, cost-effective customer interface services. In

<h3><font color="#000080">International Import/Export and
Licensing Questions</font></h3>
<p><a name="iie_1"><font color="#000080">1. What does ITAR stand
for?</font></a><font color="#0000FF"><br>
ITAR is the </font><a href="itar.html"><font color="#0000FF">International
Traffic in Arms Regulations 22 CFR 120-130</font></a><font
color="#0000FF">. The ITAR includes the US Munitions List and all
regulations related to the export of defense articles and defense
services.</font></p>
<p><a name="iie_2"><font color="#000080">2. How do I figure out
which government agency controls my product?</font></a><font
color="#0000FF"><br>
Basically, the State Department controls all munitions and the
Commerce Department controls all dual use items. If your product
was specifically designed or modified for military use or has
significant security features, it may be on the US Munitions List
and be controlled by State. If you are unsure about where your
product belongs, submit a Commodities Jurisdiction to the State
Department.</font></p>
<p><a name="iie_3"><font color="#000080">3. What countries have
export restrictions?</font></a><font color="#0000FF"><br>
The proscribed list for the State Department is listed at 22 CFR
126.1. Destination proscribed by State include: Afghanistan,
Armenia, Azerbaijan, Burma, Byelarus, China, Cuba, Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia, Haiti, Iran, Iraq, Liberia, Libya,
Mongolia, Nigeria, North Korea, Rwanda, Somalia, Sudan, Syria,
Tajikstan, Vietnam and Zaire.</font></p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">For the Department of Commerce, the
proscribed list is limited to terrorist supporting countries
(Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan and Syria) and Cuba, for
most commodities. </font></p>
<p><a name="iie_4"><font color="#000080">4. What is the Denied
Persons List?</font></a><font color="#0000FF"><br>
Formerly known as the Table of Denial Orders, the DPL lists all
individuals banned from participating in an export transaction by
the US Department of Commerce. There are other lists of banned
persons like the Specially Designated Nationals of the State
Department. </font></p>
<p><a name="iie_5"><font color="#000080">5. What is the
registration process?</font></a><font color="#0000FF"><br>
All manufacturers and exporters of defense articles and defense
services are required to be registered with the U.S. Department
of State. In order to apply for a State Department license, a
company must be registered.</font></p>
<p><a name="iie_6"><font color="#000080">6. When does my
registration expire?</font></a><font color="#0000FF"><br>
The first four digits of your PM/DTC code are the expiration
date. IE 0996 expires at the end of September 1996.</font></p>
<p><a name="iie_7"><font color="#000080">7. What role does the
Defense Department play in the licensing process?</font></a><font
color="#0000FF"><br>
Defense reviews State and Commerce licenses when necessary. It
does not issue licenses.</font></p>
<p><a name="iie_8"><font color="#000080">8. How long does it take
to get a license?</font></a><font color="#0000FF"><br>
For Commerce Department licenses, the process is limited to 39
calender days (without escalation to committee).</font></p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">For the State Department there is no
time limit. Licenses could take anywhere from 5 days to a year to
be issued. Most licenses take between 3-10 weeks.</font></p>
<p><a name="iie_9"><font color="#000080">9. Where can I get a
copy of the ITAR or EAR?</font></a><font color="#0000FF"><br>
For an official copy, contact the Superintendant of Documents,
Government Printing Office. There is a link to their webpage on
the CSL '</font><a href="links.html"><font color="#0000FF">Useful
Links</font></a><font color="#0000FF">' page.</font></p>

<h3><font color="#000080">World Wide Web FAQ</font></h3>
<p><font color="#000080">1</font><a name="www_2"><font
color="#000080">. What is a &quot;FAQ&quot;?<br>
</font></a><font color="#0000FF">FAQ (rhymes with
&quot;back&quot;) stands for Frequently Asked Questions; every
site should have one. It's a collection of questions commonly
asked by customers and site visitors, complete with answers. If
you have a question that's not addressed here, </font><a

<p><font color="#000080">2</font><a name="www_3"><font
color="#000080">. How do I get my site on the Web?<br>
</font></a><font color="#0000FF">You'll need a <strong>provider</strong>.
CSL currently works with </font><a
href="http://www.ngen.com/nextgen/"><font color="#0000FF">Next
Generation Computer Systems</font></a><font color="#0000FF"> in
Washington, DC. Next Generation designed this site, and is
hosting it on a server located in the District. You can either
speak with your current provider -- AOL, Compuserve, Erol's,
PSInet, UUnet, etc. -- to arrange for web space, or you can
contact Next Generation.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">3</font><a name="www_4"><font
color="#000080">. How do I download the ITAR from this website?<br>
</font></a><font color="#0000FF">In most browsers, you can simply
right-click the link to download the referenced file. In English,
this means you place the mouse over the highlighted text, and
click and hold the right (non-primary) mouse button, and a menu
should appear. Select the &quot;<u>S</u>ave link as...&quot;
option (or something similar), and a dialog box should appear.
Now you select where you would like to save the file. Press <u>O</u>K,
and the file should begin to download. Once the download is
complete, you may view the file using your preferred software.<br>

<p>Authority: Secs. 2, 38 and 71, Pub. L. 90-629, 90 Stat. 744 (22 U.S.C. 2752, 2778, 2797); E.O. 11958, 42 
FR 4311; 3 CFR 1977 Comp. P. 79; 22 U.S.C. 2658. </p>
<p>&#167;<b> </b><a name="120.1">120.1</a> GENERAL AUTHORITY AND ELIGIBILITY. </p>
<p>(a) Section 38 of the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2778) authorizes the President to control the 
export and import of defense articles and defense services. The statutory authority of the President to 
promulgate regulations with respect to exports of defense articles and defense services was delegated to 
the Secretary of State by Executive Order 11958, as amended (42 FR 4311). This subchapter implements 
that authority. By virtue of delegations of authority by the Secretary of State, these regulations are 
primarily administered by the Director of the Office of Defense Trade Controls, Bureau of 
Political-Military Affairs, Department of State. </p>
<p>(b) Authorized Officials. All authorities conferred upon the Director of the Office of Defense Trade 
Controls by this subchapter may be exercised at any time by the UnderSecretary of State for International 
Security Affairs, the Assistant Secretary of State for Political-Military Affairs, or the Deputy Assistant 
Secretary of State for Political-Military Affairs responsible for supervising the Office of Defense Trade 
Controls unless the Legal Adviser or the Assistant Legal Adviser for Political-Military Affairs of the 
Department of State determines that any specific exercise of this authority under this subsection may be 
inappropriate. </p>
<p>(c ) Eligibility. Only U.S. persons (as defined in &#167; 120.15) and foreign governmental entities in the United 
States may be granted licenses or other approvals (other than retransfer approvals sought pursuant to this 
subchapter). Foreign persons (as defined in &#167; 120.16) other than governments are not eligible. U.S. 
persons who have been convicted of violating the criminal statutes enumerated in &#167; 120.27, who have been 
debarred pursuant to part 127 or 128 of this subchapter, who are the subject of an indictment involving the 
criminal statues enumerated in &#167; 120.27, who are ineligible to contract with, or to receive a license or 
other form of authorization to import defense articles or defense services from any agency of the U.S. 
Government, who are ineligible to receive export licenses (or other forms of authorization to export) from 
any agency of the U.S. Government, who are ineligible to receive export licenses (or other forms of 
authorization to export ) from any agency of the U.S. Government, who are subject to Department of State 
Suspension/Revocation under &#167; 126.7 (a)(1)-(a)(7) of this subchapter, or who are ineligible under &#167; 
127.6(c ) of this subchapter are generally ineligible. Applications for licenses or other approvals will be 
considered only if the applicant has registered with the Office of Defense Trade Controls pursuant to part 
122 of this subchapter. All applications and requests for approval must be signed by a U.S. person who 
has been empowered by the registrant to sign such documents. </p>
<p>(d) The exemptions provided in this subchapter do not apply to transactions in which the exporter or any 
party to the export (as defined in &#167; 126.7(e) of this subchapter) is generally ineligible as set forth above in 
paragraph (c ) of this section, unless an exception has been granted pursuant to &#167; 126.7(c ) of this 
subchapter. </p>
<p>&#167; <a name="120.2">120.2</a> DESIGNATION OF DEFENSE ARTICLES AND DEFENSE SERVICES. </p>
<p>The Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2778(a) and 2794(7)) provides that the President shall designate 
the articles and services deemed to be defense articles and defense services for purposes of this 
subchapter. The items so designated constitute the United States Munitions List and are specified in part 
121 of this subchapter. Such designations are made by the Department of State with the concurrence of the 
Department of Defense. For a determination on whether a particular item is included on the U.S. Munitions 
List see &#167; 120.4 (a). </p>
<p>&#167;<b> </b><a name="120.3">120.3</a> POLICY ON DESIGNATING AND DETERMINING DEFENSE ARTICLES AND DEFENSE 
SERVICES<b>.</b> </p>
<p>An article or service may be designated or determined in the future to be a defense article (see &#167; 120.6) or 
defense service (see &#167; 120.9) if it: </p>
<p>(a) Is specifically designed, developed, configured, adapted, or modified for a military application, and </p>
<p>(i) Does not have predominant civil application, and </p>
<p>(ii) Does not have performance equivalent (defined by form, fit and function) to those of an article or 
service used for civil applications; or </p>
<p>(b) Is specifically designed, developed, configured, adapted, or modified for a military or intelligence 
applicability such that control under this subchapter is necessary. </p>
<p>The intended use of the article or service after its export (i.e. for a military or civilian purpose) is not 
relevant in determining whether the article or service is subject to the controls of this subchapter. Any item 
covered by the U.S. Munitions List must be within the categories of the U.S. Munitions List. The scope of 
the U.S. Munitions List shall be changed only by amendments made pursuant to section 38 of the Arms 
Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2778) </p>
<p>&#167;<b> </b><a name="120.4">120.4</a> COMMODITY JURISDICTION. </p>
<p>(a) The commodity jurisdiction procedure is used with the U.S. Government if doubt exists as to whether 
an article or service is covered by the U.S. Munitions List. It may also be used for consideration of a 
redesignation of an article or service currently covered by the U.S. Munitions List. The Department must 
submit a report to Congress at least 30 days before any item is removed from the U.S. Munitions List. 
Upon written request, the Office of Defense Trade Controls shall provide a determination of whether a 
particular article or service is covered by the U.S. Munitions List. The determination, consistent with 
Secs. 120.2, 120.3 and 120.4, entails consultation among the Departments of State, Defense, Commerce 
and other U.S. Government agencies and industry in appropriate cases. </p>
<p>(b) Registration with the Office of Defense Trade Controls as defined in part 122 of this subchapter is not 
required prior to submission of a commodity jurisdiction request. If it is determined that the commodity is 
a defense article or service covered by the U.S. Munitions List, registration is required for exporters, 
manufacturers, and furnishers of defense articles and defense services (see part 122 of this subchapter). </p>
<p>(c ) Requests shall identify the article or service, and include a history of the product's design, 
development and use. Brochures, specifications and any other documentation related to the article or 
service shall be submitted in seven collated sets. </p>
<p>(d)(1) A determination that an article or service does not have predominant civil applications hall be 
made by the Department of State, in accordance with this subchapter, on a case-by-case basis, taking into 
account: </p>
<p>(i) The number, variety and predominance of civil applications; </p>
<p>(ii) The nature, function and capability of the civil applications; and </p>
<p>(iii) The nature, function and capability of the military applications. </p>
<p>(2) A determination that an article does not have the performance equivalent, defined by form, fit and 
function, to those used for civil applications shall be made by the Department of State, in accordance with 
this subchapter, on a case-by-case basis, taking into account: </p>
<p>(i) The nature, function, and capability of the article; </p>
<p>(ii) Whether the components used in the defense article are identical to those components originally 
developed for civil use. </p>
<p>NOTE: The form of the item is its defined configuration, including the geometrically measured 
configuration, density and weight or other visual parameters which uniquely characterize the item, 
component or assembly. For software, form denotes language, language level and media. The fit of the 
item is its ability to physically interface or interconnect with or become an integral part of another item. 
The function of the item is the action or actions it is designed to perform. </p>
<p>(3) A determination that an article has significant military or intelligence applications such that it is 
necessary to control its export as a defense article shall be made, in accordance with this subchapter, on a 
case-by-case basis, taking into account: </p>
<p>(i) the nature, function and capability of the article; </p>
<p>(ii) The nature of controls imposed by other nations on such items (including COCOM and other 
multilateral controls), and </p>
<p>(iii) That items described on the COCOM Industrial List shall not be designated defense articles or 
defense services unless the failure to control such items on the U.S. Munitions List would jeopardize 
significant national security or foreign policy interests. </p>
<p>(e) The Office of Defense Trade Controls will provide a preliminary response within 10 working days of 
receipt of a complete request for commodity jurisdiction. If after 45 days the Office of Defense Trade 
Controls has not provided a final commodity jurisdiction determination, the applicant may request in 
writing to the Director, Center for Defense Trade that this determination be given expedited processing. </p>
<p>(f) State, Defense and Commerce will resolve commodity jurisdiction disputes in accordance with 
established procedures. State shall notify Defense and Commerce of the initiation and conclusion of each 
case. </p>
<p>(g) A person may appeal a commodity jurisdiction determination by submitting a written request for 
reconsideration to the Director of the Center for Defense Trade. The Center for Defense Trade will 
provide a written response of the Director's determination within 30 days of receipt of the appeal. If 
desired, an appeal of the Director's decision can then be made directly to the Assistant Secretary for 
Political-Military Affairs. </p>
<p>&#167; <a name="120.5">120.5</a> RELATION TO REGULATIONS OF OTHER AGENCIES. </p>
<p>If an article or service is covered by the U.S. Munitions List, its export is regulated by the Department of 
State, except as indicated otherwise in this subchapter. For the relationship of this subchapter to 
regulations of the Department of Commerce, the Department of Energy and the Nuclear Regulatory 
Commission, see &#167; 123.20 of this subchapter. The Treasury Department controls permanent imports of 
articles and services covered by the U.S. Munitions Import List from foreign countries by persons subject 
to U.S. jurisdiction (31 CFR part 505). The Department of Commerce regulates the export of items on the 
Commerce Control List (CCL) under the Export Administration regulations (15 CFR parts 768-799). </p>
<p>&#167; <a name="120.6">120.6</a> DEFENSE ARTICLE. </p>
<p>Defense article means any item or technical data designated in 121.1 of this subchapter. The policy 
described in &#167; 120.3 is applicable to designations of additional items. This term includes technical data 
recorded or stored in any physical form, models, mock-ups or other items that reveal technical data 
directly relating to items designated in &#167; 121.1 of this subchapter. It does not include basic marketing 
information on function or purpose or general system descriptions. </p>
<p>&#167; <a name="120.7">120.7</a> SIGNIFICANT MILITARY EQUIPMENT. </p>
<p>(a) Significant military equipment means articles for which special export controls are warranted because 
of their capacity for substantial military utility or capability. Section 47(6) of the Arms Export Control Act 
(22 U.S.C. 2794(6) note) refers to significant combat equipment on the U.S. Munitions List. The terms 
significant military equipment are equivalent for purposes of that section of the arms Export Control Act 
and this subchapter. </p>
<p>(b) Significant military equipment includes: </p>
<p>(1) Items in &#167;121.1 of this subchapter which are preceded by an asterisk; and </p>
<p>(2) All classified articles enumerated in &#167; 121.1. of this subchapter. </p>
<p>&#167; <a name="120.8">120.8</a> MAJOR DEFENSE EQUIPMENT. </p>
<p>Pursuant to section 47(6) of the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2794(6) note), major defense 
equipment means any item of significant military equipment (as defined in &#167;120.7) on the U.S. Munitions 
List having a nonrecurring research and development cost of more than $50,000,000 or a total production 
cost of more than $200,000,000. </p>
<p>&#167; <a name="120.9">120.9</a> DEFENSE SERVICE </p>
<p>Defense Service Means: </p>
<p>(1) The furnishing of assistance (including training) to foreign persons, whether in the United States or

<p>Technical data means, for purposes of this subchapter: </p>
<p>(1) Information, other than software as defined in &#167;120.10 (4), which is required for the design 
development, production, manufacture, assembly, operation, repair, testing, maintenance, or modification 
of defense articles. This includes information in the form of blueprints, drawings, photographs, plans, 
instructions and documentation. </p>
<p>(2) Classified information relating to defense articles and defense services; </p>
<p>(3) Information covered by an invention secrecy order; </p>
<p>(4) Software as defined in &#167;121.8(f) of this subchapter directly related to defense articles; </p>

defined in &#167;120.11. It also does not include basic marketing information on function or purpose or general 
system descriptions of defense articles. </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="120.11">120.11</a> PUBLIC DOMAIN. </p>
<p>Public domain means information which is published and which is generally accessible or available to the 
public: </p>
<p>(1) Through sales at newsstands and bookstores; </p>
<p>(2) Through subscriptions which are available without restriction to any individual who desires to obtain 
or purchase the published information; </p>
<p>(3) Through second class mailing privileges granted by the U.S. Government; </p>
<p>(4) At libraries open to the public or from which the public can obtain documents; </p>

this subchapter); </p>
<p>(8) Through fundamental research in science and engineering at accredited institutions of higher learning in 
the U.S. where the resulting information is ordinarily published and shared broadly in the scientific 
community. Fundamental research is defined to mean basic and applied research in science and 
engineering where the resulting information is ordinarily published and shared broadly within the 
scientific community, as distinguished from research the results of which are restricted for proprietary 
reasons or specific U.S. Government access and dissemination controls. University research will not be 
considered fundamental research if: </p>
<p>(i) The University or its researchers accept other restrictions on publication of scientific and technical 
information resulting from the project or activity, or </p>
<p>(ii) The research is funded by the U.S. Government and specific access and dissemination controls

1977 Comp. P. 79; 22 U.S.C. 2658) </p>
<p>&#167; <a name="122.1">122.1</a> Registration requirements. </p>
<p>(a) Any person who engages in the United States in the business of either manufacturing or exporting 
defense articles or furnishing defense services is required to register with the Office of Defense Trade 
Controls. Manufacturers who do not engage in exporting must nevertheless register. </p>
<p>(b) Exemptions. Registration is not required for: </p>
<p>(1) Officers and employees of the United States Government acting in an official capacity. </p>
<p>(2) Persons whose pertinent business activity is confined to the production of unclassified technical data 
only. </p>
<p>(3) Persons all of whose manufacturing and export activities are licensed under the Atomic Energy Act of 
1954, as amended. </p>
<p>(4) Persons who engage only in the fabrication of articles for experimental or scientific purpose, including 
research and development. </p>
<p>(c ) Purpose. Registration is primarily a means to provide the U.S. Government with necessary information 
on who is involved in certain manufacturing and exporting activities. Registration does not confer any 
export rights or privileges. It is generally a precondition to the issuance of any license or other approval 
under this subchapter. </p>
<p>&#167; <a name="122.2">122.2</a> Submission of registration statement. </p>
<p>(a) General. The Department of State Form DSP-9 (Registration Statement) and the transmittal letter 
required by paragraph (b) of this section must be submitted by an intended registrant with a payment by 
check or money order payable to the Department of State of one of the fees prescribed in 122.3(a) of this 
subchapter. The Registration Statement and transmittal letter must be signed by a senior officer who has 
been empowered by the intended registrant to sign such documents. The intended registrant shall also 
submit documentation that demonstrates that it is incorporated or otherwise authorized to do business in 
the United States. The Office of Defense Trade Controls will return to the sender any Registration 
Statement that is incomplete, or that is not accompanied by the required letter or payment of the proper 
registration fee. </p>
<p>(b) Transmittal letter. A letter of transmittal, signed by an authorized senior officer of the intended 
registrant, shall accompany each Registration Statement. </p>
<p>(1) The letter shall state whether the intended registrant, chief executive officer, president, 
vice-presidents, other senior officers or officials (e.g. comptroller, treasurer, general counsel) or any 
member of the board of directors: </p>
<p>(i) Has ever been indicted for or convicted of violating any of the U.S. criminal statutes enumerated in 
120.27 of this subchapter; or </p>
<p>(ii) Is ineligible to contract with, or to receive a license or other approval to import defense articles or 
defense services from, or to receive an export license or other approval from, any agency of the U.S. 
Government. </p>
<p>(2) The letter shall also declare whether the intended registrant is owned or controlled by foreign persons 
(as defined in 120.16 of this subchapter). If the intended registrant is owned or controlled by foreign 
persons, the letter shall also state whether the intended registrant is incorporated or otherwise authorized 
to engage in business in the United States. </p>
<p>(c ) Definition. For purposes of this section, ownership means that more than 50 percent of the outstanding 
voting securities of the firm are owned by one or more foreign persons. Control means that one or more 
foreign persons have the authority or ability to establish or direct the general policies or day-to-day 
operations of the firm. Control is presumed to exist where foreign persons own 25 percent or more of the 
outstanding voting securities if no U.S. persons control an equal or larger percentage. The standards for 
control specified in 22 CFR 60.2(c ) also provide guidance in determining whether control in fact exists. </p>
<p>&#167; <a name="122.3">122.3</a> Registration fees. </p>
<p>(a) A person who is required to register may do so for a period up to 5 years upon submission of a 
completed form DSP-9, transmittal letter, and payment of a fee as follows: </p>
<p>1 year $250 </p>
<p>2 years 500 </p>
<p>3 years 700 </p>
<p>4 years 850 </p>
<p>5 years 1,000 </p>
<p>(b) Lapse in registration. A registrant who fails to renew a registration and, after an intervening period, 
seeks to register again must pay registration fees for any part of such intervening period during which the 
registrant engaged in the business of manufacturing or exporting defense </p>
<p>articles or defense services. </p>
<p>(c ) Refund of fee. Fees paid in advance for future years of a multiple year registration will be refunded 
upon request if the registrant ceases to engage in the manufacture or export of defense articles and defense 
services. A request for a refund must be submitted to the Office of Defense Trade Controls prior to the 
beginning of any year for which a refund is claimed. </p>
<p>&#167; <a name="122.4">122.4</a> Notification of changes in information furnished by registrants. </p>
<p>(a) A registrant must, within five days of the event, notify the Office of Defense Trade Controls by 
registered mail if: </p>
<p>(1) Any of the persons referred to in 122.2(b) are indicted for or convicted of violating any of the U.S. 
criminal statutes enumerated in 120.27 of this subchapter, or become ineligible to contract with, or to 
receive a license or other approval to export or temporarily import defense articles or defense services 
from any agency of the U.S. government; or </p>
<p>(2) There is a material change in the information contained in the Registration Statement, including a 
change in the senior officers; the establishment, acquisition or divestment of a subsidiary or foreign 
affiliate; a merger; a change of location; or the dealing in an additional </p>
<p>category of defense articles or defense services. </p>
<p>(b) A registrant must notify the Office of Defense Trade Controls by registered mail at least 60 days in 
advance of any intended sale or transfer to a foreign person of ownership or control of the registrant or any 
entity thereof. Such notice does not relieve the registrant from obtaining the approval required under this 
subchapter for the export of defense articles or defense services to a foreign person, including the 
approval required prior to disclosing technical data. Such notice provides the Office of Defense Trade 
Controls with the information necessary to determine whether the authority of section 38(g)(6) of the Arms 
Export Control Act regarding licenses or other approvals for certain sales or transfers of articles or data 
should be invoked (see 120.10 and 126.1(e) of this subchapter). </p>
<p>(c ) The new entity formed when a registrant merges with another company or acquires, or is acquired by, 
another company or a subsidiary or division of another company shall advise the Office of Defense Trade 
Controls of the following: </p>
<p>(1) The new firm name and all previous firm names being disclosed; </p>
<p>(2) The registration number that will survive and those that are to be discontinued (if any); </p>
<p>(3) The license numbers of all approvals on which unshipped balances will be shipped under the 
surviving registration number, since any license not the subject of notification will be considered invalid; 
and </p>
<p>(4) Amendments to agreements approved by the Office of Defense Trade Controls to change the name of a 
party to those agreements. The registrant must, within 60 days of this notification, provide to the Office of 
Defense Trade Controls a signed copy of an amendment to each agreement signed by the new U.S. entity, 
the former U.S. licensor and the foreign licensee. Any agreements not so amended will be considered 
invalid. </p>
<p>(d) Prior approval by the Office of Defense Trade Controls is required for any amendment making a 
substantive change. </p>
<p>&#167; <a name="122.5">122.5</a> Maintenance of records by registrants. </p>
<p>(a) A person who is required to register must maintain records concerning the manufacture, acquisition and 
disposition of defense articles; the provision of defense services; and information on political 
contributions, fees, or commissions furnished or obtained, as required by part 130 of this subchapter. All 
such records must be maintained for a period of five years from the expiration of the license or other 
approval. The Director, Office of Defense Trade Controls, may prescribe a longer or shorter period in 
individual cases. </p>
<p>(b) Records maintained under this section shall be available at all times for inspection and copying by the 
Director, Office of Defense Trade Controls or a person designated by the Director (the Director of the 
Diplomatic Security Service or a person designated by the Director of the Diplomatic Security Service or 
another designee), or the Commissioner of the U.S. Customs Service or a person designated by the 
Commissioner. </p>

3 CFR 1977 Comp. 79; 22 U.S.C. 2658. </p>
<p>&#167; <a name="123.1">123.1</a> Requirement for export or temporary import licenses. </p>
<p>(a) Any person who intends to export or to import temporarily a defense article must obtain the approval 
of the Office of Defense Trade Controls prior to the export or temporary import, unless the export or 
temporary import qualifies for an exemption under the provisions of this subchapter. </p>
<p>Applications for export or temporary import must be made as follows: </p>
<p>(1) Applications for licenses for permanent export must be made on Form DSP-5 (unclassified); </p>
<p>(2) Applications for licenses for temporary export must be made on Form DSP-73 (unclassified); </p>
<p>(3) Applications for licenses for temporary import must be made on Form DSP-61 (unclassified); and </p>
<p>(4) Applications for the export or temporary import of classified defense articles or classified technical 
data must be made on Form DSP-85. </p>
<p>(b) Applications for Department of State export licenses must be confined to proposed exports of defense 
articles including technical data. </p>
<p>(c ) As a condition to the issuance of a license or other approval, the Office of Defense Trade Controls 
may require all pertinent documentary information regarding the proposed transaction and proper 
completion of the application form as follows: </p>
<p>(1) Form DSP-5, DSP-61, DSP-73, and DSP-85 applications must have an entry in each block where 
space is provided for an entry. All requested information must be provided. </p>
<p>(2) Attachments and supporting technical data or brochures should be submitted in seven collated copies. 
Two copies of any freight forwarder lists must be submitted. If the request is limited to renewal of a 
previous license or for the export of spare parts, only two sets of any attachment (including freight 
forwarder lists) and one copy of the previous license should be submitted. </p>
<p>(3) A certification letter signed by an empowered official must accompany all application submissions 
(see &#167; 126.13 of this subchapter). </p>
<p>(4) An application for a license under this part for the permanent export of defense articles sold 
commercially must be accompanied by a copy of a purchase order, letter of intent or other appropriate 
documentation. In cases involving the U.S. Foreign Military Sales program, three copies of the relevant 
Department of Defense Form 1513 are required, unless the procedures of &#167;126.4(c ) or &#167;126.6 of this 
subchapter are followed. </p>
<p>(5) Form DSP-83, duly executed, must accompany all license applications for the permanent export of 
significant military equipment, including classified hardware or classified technical data (see &#167; 123.10 
and &#167; 125.3 of this subchapter). </p>
<p>(6) A statement concerning the payment of political contributions, fees and commissions must accompany a 
permanent export application if the export involves defense articles or defense services valued in an 
amount of $500,000 or more and is being sold commercially to or for the use of the armed forces of a 
foreign country or international organization (see part 130 of this subchapter). </p>
<p>(d) Provisions for furnishing the type of defense services described in &#167;120.9(a) of this subchapter are 
contained in part 124 of this subchapter. Provisions for the export or temporary import of technical data 
and classified defense articles are contained in part 125 of this subchapter. </p>
<p>(e) A request for a license for the export of unclassified technical data (DSP-5) related to a classified 
defense article should specify any classified technical data or material that subsequently will be required 
for export in the event of a sale. </p>
<p>&#167; <a name="123.2">123.2</a> Import jurisdiction. </p>
<p>The Department of State regulates the temporary import of defense articles. Permanent imports of defense 
articles into the United States are regulated by the Department of the Treasury (see 27 CFR parts 47, 178 
and 179). </p>
<p>&#167; <a name="123.3">123.3</a> Temporary import licenses. </p>
<p>(a) A license (DSP-61) issued by the Office of Defense Trade Controls is required for the temporary 
import and subsequent export of unclassified defense articles, unless exempted from this requirement 
pursuant to 123.4. This requirement applies to: </p>
<p>(1) Temporary imports of unclassified defense articles that are to be returned directly to the country from 
which they were shipped to the United States; </p>
<p>(2) Temporary imports of unclassified defense articles in transit to a third country; </p>
<p>(b) A bond may be required as appropriate (see part 125 of this subchapter for license requirements for 
technical data and classified defense articles.) </p>
<p>&#167; <a name="123.4">123.4</a> Temporary import license exemptions. </p>
<p>(a) District Directors of Customs shall permit the temporary import (and subsequent export) without a 
license, for a period of up to 4 years, of unclassified U.S.-origin defense articles (including any article 
manufactured abroad pursuant to U.S. Government approval) if the article temporarily imported: </p>
<p>(1) Is serviced (e.g., inspection, testing, calibration or repair, including overhaul, reconditioning and 
one-to-one replacement of any defective articles, parts or components, but excluding any modification, 
enhancement, upgrade or other form of alteration or improvement that changes the basic performance of the 
article), and is subsequently returned to the country from which it was imported. Shipment may be made by 
the U.S. importer or a foreign government representative of the country from which the goods were 
imported; or </p>
<p>(2) Is to be enhanced, upgraded or incorporated into another article which has already been authorized by 
the Office of Defense Trade Controls for permanent export; or </p>
<p>(3) Is imported for the purpose of exhibition, demonstration or marketing in the United States and is 
subsequently returned to the country from which it was imported; or </p>
<p>(4) Has been rejected for permanent import by the Department of the Treasury and is being returned to the 
country from which it was shipped; or </p>
<p>(5) Is approved for such import under the U.S. Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program pursuant to an 
executed U.S. Department of Defense Letter of Offer and Acceptance (DD Form 1513). </p>
<p>Note: These Exceptions do not apply to shipments that transit the U.S. to or from Canada (see &#167; 123.19 and 
&#167; 126.5 of this subchapter for exceptions). </p>
<p>(b) District Directors of Customs shall permit the temporary import (but not the subsequent export) without 
a license of unclassified defense articles that are to be incorporated into another article, or modified, 
enhanced, upgraded, altered, improved or serviced in any other manner that changes the basic performance 
or productivity of the article prior to being returned to the country from which they were shipped or prior 
to being shipped to a third country. A DSP-5 is required for the reexport of such unclassified defense 
articles after incorporation into another article, modification, enhancement, upgrading, alteration or 
improvement. </p>
<p>(c ) Requirements. To use an exemption under &#167; 123.4 (a) or (b), the following criteria must be met: </p>
<p>(1) The importer must meet the eligibility requirements set forth in 120.1(b) of this subchapter; </p>
<p>(2) At the time of export, the ultimate consignee named on the Shipper's Export Declaration (SED) must be 
the same as the foreign consignee or end-user of record named at the time of import; and </p>
<p>(3) As stated in &#167; 126.1 of this subchapter, the temporary import must not be from or on behalf of a 
proscribed country listed in that section unless an exception has been granted in accordance with &#167; 126.3 
of this subchapter. </p>
<p>(d) Procedures. To the satisfaction of the District Director of Customs, the importer and exporter must 
comply with the following procedures: </p>
<p>(1) At the time of temporary import -- </p>
<p>(i) File and annotate the applicable U.S. Customs document (e.g., Form CF 3461, 7512, 7501, 7523 or 
3311) to read: ``This shipment is being imported in accordance with and under the authority of 22 CFR 
123.4(a) (identify subsection),'' and </p>
<p>(ii) Include, on the invoice or other appropriate documentation, a complete list and description of the 
defense article(s) being imported, including quantity and U.S. dollar value; and </p>
<p>(2) At the time of export, file with the District Director of Customs at the port of exit a Shipper's Export 
Declaration (Department of Commerce Form 7525-V) and include on the SED or as an attachment the 
following information: </p>
<p>(i) the U.S. Customs entry document number or a copy of the U.S. Customs documentation under which the 
article was imported; </p>
<p>(ii) the following statement: ``22 CFR (identify section) and 22 CFR 120.1(b) applicable.'' </p>
<p>&#167; <a name="123.5">123.5</a> Temporary export licenses. </p>
<p>(a) The Office of Defense Trade Controls may issue a license for the temporary export of unclassified 
defense articles (DSP-73). Such licenses are valid only if (1) the article will be exported for a period of 
less than 4 years and will be returned to the United States and (2) transfer of title will not occur during the 
period of temporary export. Accordingly, articles exported pursuant to a temporary export license may not 
be sold or otherwise permanently transferred to a foreign person while they are overseas under a 
temporary export license. A renewal of the license or other written approval must be obtained from the 
Office of Defense Trade Controls if the article is to remain outside the United States beyond the period for 
which the license is valid. </p>
<p>(b) Requirements. Defense articles authorized for temporary export under this section may be shipped only 
from a port in the United States where a District Director of Customs is available, or from a U.S. Post 
Office (see 39 CFR part 20), as appropriate. The license for temporary export must be presented to the 
District Director of Customs who, upon verification, will endorse the exit column on the reverse side of 
the license. In some instances of the temporary export of technical data (e.g postal shipments), 
self-endorsement will be necessary (see &#167;123.22(d)). The endorsed license for temporary export is to be 
retained by the licensee. In the case of a military aircraft or vessel exported under its own power, the 
endorsed license must be carried on board such vessel or aircraft as evidence that it has been duly 
authorized by the Department of State to leave the United States temporarily. </p>
<p>(c ) Upon the return to the United States of defense articles covered by a license for temporary export, the 
license will be endorsed in the entry column by the District Director of Customs. This procedure shall be 
followed for all exits and entries made during the period for which the </p>
<p>license is valid. The licensee must send the license to the Office of Defense Trade Controls immediately 
upon expiration or after the final return of the defense articles approved for export, whichever occurs first. </p>
<p>&#167; <a name="123.6">123.6</a> Foreign trade zones and U.S. Customs bonded warehouses. </p>
<p>Foreign trade zones and U.S. Customs bonded warehouses are considered integral parts of the United 
States for the purpose of this subchapter. An export license is therefore not required for shipment between 
the United States and a foreign trade zone or a Customs bonded warehouse. In the case of classified 
defense articles, the provisions of the Department of Defense Industrial Security Manual will apply. An 
export license is required for all shipments of articles on the U.S. Munitions List from foreign trade zones 
and U.S. Customs bonded warehouses to foreign countries, regardless of how the articles reached the zone 
or warehouse. </p>
<p>&#167; <a name="123.7">123.7</a> Exports to warehouses or distribution points outside the United States. </p>
<p>Unless the exemption under &#167;123.16(b)(1) is used, a license is required to export defense articles to a 
warehouse or distribution point outside the United States for subsequent resale and will normally be 
granted only if an agreement has been approved pursuant to &#167;124.14 of this subchapter. </p>
<p>&#167; <a name="123.8">123.8</a> Special controls on vessels, aircraft and satellites covered by the U.S. Munitions List. </p>
<p>(a) Transferring registration or control to a foreign person of any aircraft, vessel, or satellite on the U.S. 
Munitions List is an export for purposes of this subchapter and requires a license or written approval from 
the Office of Defense Trade Controls. This requirement applies whether the aircraft, vessel, or satellite is 
physically located in the United States or abroad. </p>
<p>(b) The registration in a foreign country of any aircraft, vessel or satellite covered by the U.S. Munitions 
List which is not registered in the United States but which is located in the United States constitutes an 
export. A license or written approval from the Office of Defense Trade Controls is therefore required. 
Such transactions may also require the prior approval of the Maritime Administration, the Federal 
Aviation </p>
<p>Administration or other agencies of the U.S. Government. </p>
<p>&#167; <a name="123.9">123.9</a> Country of ultimate destination and approval of reexports or retransfers. </p>
<p>(a) The country designated as the country of ultimate destination on an application for an export license, or 
on a Shipper's Export Declaration where an exemption is claimed under this subchapter, must be the 
country of ultimate end-use. The written approval of the Office of Defense Trade Controls must be 
obtained before reselling, transferring, transshipping, or disposing of a defense article to any end user, end 
use or destination other than as stated on the export license, or on the Shipper's Export Declaration in 
cases where an exemption is claimed under this subchapter. Exporters must ascertain the specific end-user 
and end-use prior to submitting an application to the Office of Defense Trade Controls or claiming an 
exemption under this subchapter. </p>
<p>(b) The exporter shall incorporate the following statement as an integral part of the bill of lading, and the 
invoice whenever defense articles on the U.S. Munitions List are to be exported: </p>
<p>These commodities are authorized by the U.S. Government for export only to (country of ultimate 
destination) for use by (end-user). They may not be transferred, transshipped on a non-continuous voyage, 
or otherwise be disposed of in any other country, either in their original form or after being incorporated 
into other end-items, without the prior written approval of the U.S. Department of State.'' </p>
<p>(c ) A U.S. person or a foreign person requesting approval for the reexport or retransfer, or change in 
end-use, of a defense article shall submit a written request which shall be subject to all the documentation 
required for a permanent export license (see &#167;123.1) and shall contain the following: </p>
<p>(1) The license number under which the defense article was previously authorized for export from the 
United States; </p>
<p>(2) A precise description, quantity and value of the defense article; </p>
<p>(3) A description of the new end-use; and </p>
<p>(4) Identification of the new end-user. </p>
<p>(d) The written approval of the Office of Defense Trade Controls must be obtained before reselling, 
transferring, transshipping on a non-continuous voyage, or disposing of a defense article in any country 
other than the country of ultimate destination, or anyone other than the authorized end-user, as stated on the 
Shipper's Export Declaration in cases where an exemption is claimed under this subchapter. </p>
<p>(e) Reexports or retransfers of U.S.-origin components incorporated into a foreign defense article to a 
government of a NATO country, or the governments of Australia or Japan, are authorized without the prior 
written approval of the Office of Defense Trade Controls, provided: </p>
<p>(1) The U.S.-origin components were previously authorized for export from the United States, either by a 
license or an exemption; </p>
<p>(2) The U.S.-origin components are not significant military equipment, the items are not major defense 
equipment sold under a contract in the amount of $14,000,000 ($14 million) or more; the articles are not 
defense articles or defense services sold under a contract in the amount of $50,000,000 ($50 million) or 
more; and are not identified in part 121 of this subchapter as Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) 
items; and </p>
<p>(3) The person reexporting the defense article must provide written notification to the Office of Defense 
Trade Controls of the retransfer not later than 30 days following the reexport. The notification must state 
the articles being reexported and the recipient government. </p>
<p>(4) In certain cases, the Director, Office of Defense Trade Controls, may place retransfer restrictions on a 
license prohibiting use of this exemption. </p>
<p>&#167; <a name="123.10">123.10</a> Non-transfer and use assurances. </p>
<p>(a) A nontransfer and use certificate (Form DSP-83) is required for the export of significant military 
equipment and classified articles including classified technical data. A license will not be issued until a 
completed Form DSP-83 has been received by the Office of Defense Trade Controls. This form is to be 
executed by the foreign consignee, foreign end-user, and the applicant. The certificate stipulates that, 
except as specifically authorized by prior written approval of the Department of State, the foreign 
consignee and foreign end-user will not reexport, resell or otherwise dispose of the significant military 
equipment enumerated in the application outside the country named as the location of the foreign end-use 
or to any other person. </p>
<p>(b) The Office of Defense Trade Controls may also require a DSP-83 for the export of any other defense 
articles or defense services. </p>
<p>(c ) When a DSP-83 is required for an export of any defense article or defense service to a 
non-governmental foreign end-user, the Office of Defense Trade Controls may require as a condition of 
issuing the license that the appropriate authority of the government of the country of ultimate destination 
also execute the certificate. </p>
<p>&#167; <a name="123.11">123.11</a> Movements of vessels and aircraft covered by the U.S. Munitions List outside the United States. </p>
<p>(a) A license issued by the Office of Defense Trade Controls is required whenever a privately-owned 
aircraft or vessel on the U.S. Munitions List makes a voyage outside the United States. </p>
<p>(b) Exemption. An export license is not required when a vessel or aircraft referred to in paragraph (a) of 
this section departs from the United States and does not enter the territorial waters or airspace of a foreign 
country if no defense articles are carried as cargo. Such a vessel or aircraft may not enter the territorial 
waters or airspace of a foreign country before returning to the United States, or carry as cargo any defense 
article, without a temporary export license (Form DSP-73) from the Department of State. (See &#167;123.5.) </p>
<p>&#167; <a name="123.12">123.12</a> Shipments between U.S. possessions. </p>
<p>An export license is not required for the shipment of defense articles between the United States, the 
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and U.S. possessions. A license is required, however, for the export of 
defense articles from these areas to foreign countries. </p>
<p>&#167; <a name="123.13">123.13</a> Domestic aircraft shipments via a foreign country. </p>
<p>A license is not required for the shipment by air of a defense article from one location in the United States 
to another location in the United States via a foreign country. The pilot of the aircraft must, however, file a 
written statement with the District Director of Customs at the port of exit in the United States. The original 
statement must be filed at the time of exit with the District Director of Customs. A duplicate must be filed 
at the port of reentry with the District Director of Customs, who will duly endorse it and transmit it to the 
District Director of Customs at the port of exit. The statement will be as follows: </p>
<p>Domestic Shipment Via a Foreign Country of Articles on the U.S. Munitions List </p>
<p>Under penalty according to Federal law, the undersigned certifies and warrants that all the information in 
this document is true and correct, and that the equipment listed below is being shipped from (U.S. port of 
exit) via (foreign country) to (U.S. port of entry), which is the final destination in the United States. </p>

<p>Date:. </p>
<p>&#167; <a name="123.14">123.14</a> Import certificate/delivery verification procedure. </p>
<p>(a) The Import Certificate/Delivery Verification Procedure is designed to assure that a commodity 
imported into the territory of those countries participating in IC/DV procedures will not be diverted, 
transshipped, or reexported to another destination except in accordance with export control regulations of 
the importing country. </p>
<p>(b) Exports. The Office of Defense Trade Controls may require the IC/DV procedure on proposed exports 
of defense articles to non-government entities in those countries participating in IC/DV procedures. In such 
cases, U.S. exporters must submit both an export license application (the completed Form DSP-5) and the 
original Import Certificate, which must be provided and authenticated by the government of the importing 
country. This document verifies that the foreign importer complied with the import regulations of the 
government of the importing country and that the importer declared the intention not to divert, transship or 
reexport the material described therein without the prior approval of that government. After delivery of the 
commodities to the foreign consignee, the Department of State may also require U.S. exporters to furnish 
Delivery Verification documentation from the government of the importing country. This documentation 
verifies that the delivery was in accordance with the terms of the approved export license. Both the Import 
Certificate and the Delivery Verification must be furnished to the U.S. exporter by the foreign importer. </p>
<p>(c ) Triangular transactions. When a transaction involves three or more countries that have adopted the 
IC/DV procedure, the governments of these countries may stamp a triangular symbol on the Import 
Certificate. This symbol is usually placed on the Import Certificate when the applicant for the Import 
Certificate (the importer) states either (1) that there is uncertainty whether the items covered by the Import 
Certificate will be imported into the country issuing the Import Certificate; (2) that he or she knows that the 
items will not be imported into the country issuing the Import Certificate; or (3) that, if the items are to be 
imported into the country issuing the Import Certificate, they will subsequently be reexported to another 
destination. All parties, including the ultimate consignee in the country of ultimate destination, must be 
shown on the completed Import Certificate. </p>
<p>&#167; <a name="123.15">123.15</a> Congressional notification for licenses. </p>
<p>All exports of major defense equipment, as defined in &#167;120.8 of this subchapter, sold under a contract in 
the amount of $14,000,000 or more, or exports of defense articles and defense services sold under a 
contract in the amount of $50,000,000 or more, may take place only after the Office of Defense Trade 
Controls notifies the exporter through issuance of a license or other approval that 30 calendar days have 
elapsed since receipt by the Congress of the certification required by 22 U.S.C. 2776(c)(1) and that 
Congress has not enacted a joint resolution prohibiting the export. Persons who intend to export defense 
articles and defense services pursuant to any exemption in this subchapter (e.g., &#167;126.5 of this subchapter) 
under the circumstances described in the first sentence of this subsection must notify the Office of Defense 
Trade Controls by letter of the intended export and, prior to transmittal to Congress, provide a signed 
contract and a DSP-83 signed by the applicant, the foreign consignee and end-user. </p>
<p>&#167; <a name="123.16">123.16</a> Exemptions of general applicability. </p>
<p>(a) The following exemptions apply to exports of unclassified defense articles for which no approval is 
needed from the Office of Defense Trade Controls. These exemptions do not apply to: Proscribed 
destinations under &#167;126.1 of this subchapter; exports for which Congressional notification is required; 
MTCR articles; Significant Military Equipment (SME); and may not be used by persons who are generally ineligible as described in &#167;120.1(c ) of 
this subchapter. All shipments of defense articles, including those to and from Canada, require a Shippers 
Export Declaration (SED). If the defense article is exempt from licensing, the SED must cite the 
exemption. Refer to &#167;123.22(c ) for Shipper's Export Declaration requirements. </p>
<p>(b) The following exports are exempt from the licensing requirements of this subchapter: </p>
<p>(1) District Directors of Customs shall permit the export without a license of defense articles being 
exported in furtherance of an approved manufacturing license agreement, technical assistance agreement or 
distribution agreement provided that: </p>
<p>(i) The defense articles to be exported support the activity and must be identified by item, quantity and 
value in the agreement; and </p>
<p>(ii) Any provisos or limitations placed on the authorized agreement are adhered to; and </p>
<p>(iii) The exporter certifies on the Shipper's Export Declaration that the export is exempt from the licensing 
requirements of this subchapter. This is done by writing, ``22 CFR 123.16(b)(1) and AG (identify 
agreement number) applicable and </p>
<p>(iv) The total value of all shipments does not exceed the value authorized in the agreement. </p>
<p>(v) In the case of distribution agreements, export must be made directly to the approved foreign distributor. </p>
<p>(2) District Directors of Customs shall permit the export of components or spare parts (for exemptions for 
firearms and ammunition see &#167;123.17) without a license when the total value does not exceed $500 in a 
single transaction and: </p>
<p>(i) The components or spare parts are being exported to support a defense article previously authorized for 
export; and </p>
<p>(ii) The spare parts or components are not going to a distributor, but to a previously approved end-user of 
the defense articles; and </p>
<p>(iii) The spare parts or components are not to be used to enhance the capability of the defense article; </p>
<p>(iv) exporters shall not split orders so as not to exceed the dollar value of this exemption; </p>
<p>(v) the exporter may not make more than 24 shipments per calender year to the previously authorized end 
user; </p>
<p>(vi) The exporter must certify on the Shipper's Export Declaration that the export is exempt from the 
licensing requirements of this subchapter. This is done by writing 22 CFR 123.16(b)(2) applicable. </p>
<p>(3) District Directors of Customs shall permit the export without a license, of packing cases specially 
designed to carry defense articles. </p>
<p>(4) District Directors of Customs shall permit the export without a license, of unclassified models or 
mock-ups of defense articles, provided that such models or mock-ups are nonoperable and do not reveal 
any technical data in excess of that which is exempted from the licensing requirements of &#167;125.4(b) of this 
subchapter and do not contain components covered by the U.S. Munitions List (see &#167;120.6(b) of this 
subchapter). Some models or mockups built to scale or constructed of original materials can reveal 
technical data. U.S. persons who avail themselves of this exemption must provide a written certification to 
the District Director of Customs that these conditions are met. This exemption does not imply that the 
Office of Defense Trade Controls will approve the export of any defense articles for which models or 
mocks-ups have been exported pursuant to this exemption. </p>
<p>(5) District Directors of Customs shall permit the temporary export without a license of unclassified 
defense articles to any public exhibition, trade show, air show or related event if that article has 
previously been licensed for a public exhibition, trade show, air show or related event and the license is 
still valid. U.S. persons who avail themselves of this exemption must provide a written certification to the 
District Director of Customs that these conditions are met. </p>

<p>(a) Except as provided in &#167;126.1 of this subchapter, District Directors of Customs shall permit the export 
without a license of components and parts for Category I(a) firearms, except barrels, cylinders, receivers 
(frames) or complete breach mechanisms when the total value does not exceed $500 wholesale in any 
transaction. </p>
<p>(b) District Directors of Customs shall permit the export without a license of nonautomatic firearms 
covered by Category I(a) of &#167;121.1 of this subchapter if they were manufactured in or before 1898, or are 
replicas of such firearms. </p>
<p>(c ) District Directors of Customs shall permit U.S. persons to export temporarily from the United States 
without a license not more than three nonautomatic firearms in Category I(a) of &#167;121.1 of this subchapter 
and not more than 1,000 cartridges therefor, provided that: </p>
<p>(1) A declaration by the U.S. person and an inspection by a customs officer is made; </p>
<p>(2) The firearms and accompanying ammunition must be with the U.S. person's baggage or effects, whether 
accompanied or unaccompanied (but not mailed); and </p>
<p>(3) They must be for that person's exclusive use and not for reexport or other transfer of ownership. The 
foregoing exemption is not applicable to a crew-member of a vessel or aircraft unless the crew-member 
declares the firearms to a Customs officer upon each departure from the United States, and declares that it 
is his or her intention to return the article(s) on each return to the United States. It is also not applicable to 
the personnel referred to in &#167;123.18. </p>
<p>(d) District Directors of Customs shall permit a foreign person to export without a license such firearms in 
Category I(a) of &#167;121.1 of this subchapter and ammunition therefor as the foreign person brought into the 
United States under the provisions of 27 CFR 178.115(d). (The latter provision specifically excludes from 
the definition of importation the bringing into the United States of firearms and ammunition by certain 
foreign persons for specified purposes). </p>
<p>(e) District Directors of Customs shall permit U.S. persons to export without a license ammunition for 
nonautomatic firearms referred to in paragraph (a) of this section if the quantity does not exceed 1,000

U.S. Government. </p>
<p>The following exemptions apply to members of the U.S. Armed Forces and civilian employees of the U.S. 
Government who are U.S. persons (both referred to herein as personnel). The exemptions apply only to 
such personnel if they are assigned abroad for extended duty. These exemptions do not apply to 
dependents. </p>
<p>(a) Firearms. District Directors of Customs shall permit nonautomatic firearms in Category I(a) of &#167;121.1 
of this subchapter and parts therefor to be exported, except by mail, from the United States without a 
license if: </p>
<p>(1) They are consigned to servicemen's clubs abroad for uniformed members of the U.S. Armed Forces; 
or, </p>
<p>(2) In the case of a uniformed member of the U.S. Armed Forces or a civilian employee of the Department

are accompanied by a written authorization from the commanding officer concerned; or </p>
<p>(3) In the case of other U.S. Government employees, they are for personal use and not for resale or other 
transfer of ownership, and the Chief of the U.S. Diplomatic Mission or his designee in the country of 
destination has approved in writing to Department of State the import of the specific types and quantities 
of firearms into that country. The exporter shall provide a copy of this written statement to the District 
Director of Customs. </p>
<p>(b) Ammunition. District Directors of Customs shall permit not more than 1,000 cartridges (or rounds) of 
ammunition for the firearms referred to in paragraph (a) of this section to be exported (but not mailed) 
from the United States without a license when the firearms are on the person of the owner or with his 
baggage or effects, whether accompanied or unaccompanied (but not mailed). </p>
<p>&#167; <a name="123.19">123.19</a> Canadian and Mexican border shipments. </p>
<p>A shipment originating in Canada or Mexico which incidentally transits the United States en route to a 
delivery point in the same country that originated the shipment is exempt from the requirement for an in 
transit license. </p>
<p>&#167; <a name="123.20">123.20</a> Nuclear materials. </p>
<p>(a) The provisions of this subchapter do not apply to equipment in Category VI(e) and Category XVI of 
&#167;121.1 of this subchapter to the extent such equipment is under the export control of the Department of 
Energy or the Nuclear Regulatory Commission pursuant to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, 
and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act of 1978. </p>
<p>(b) A license for the export of any machinery, device, component, equipment, or technical data relating to 
equipment referred to in Category VI(e) will not be granted unless the proposed export comes within the 
scope of an existing Agreement for Cooperation for Mutual Defense Purposes concluded pursuant to the 
Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, with the government of the country to which the article is to be 
exported. Licenses may be granted in the absence of such an agreement only (1) if the proposed export 
involves an article which is identical to that in use in an unclassified civilian nuclear power plant, (2) if 
the proposed export has no relationship to naval nuclear propulsion, and (3) if it is not for use in a naval 
propulsion plant. </p>
<p>&#167; <a name="123.21">123.21</a> Duration, renewal and disposition of licenses. </p>
<p>(a) A license is valid for four years. The license expires when the total value or quantity authorized has 
been shipped or when the date of expiration has been reached, whichever occurs first. Defense articles to 
be shipped thereafter require a new application and license. The new application should refer to the 
expired license. It should not include references to any defense articles other than those of the unshipped 
balance of the expired license. </p>
<p>(b) Unused, expired, expended, suspended, or revoked licenses must be returned immediately to the 
Department of State. </p>
<p>&#167; <a name="123.22">123.22</a> Filing of export licenses and Shipper's Export Declarations with District Directors of Customs. </p>
<p>(a) The exporter must deposit the license with the District Director of Customs at the port of exit before 
shipment, unless paragraph (d) of this section or &#167;125.9 applies (for exports by mail, see &#167;123.24). 
Licenses for temporary export or temporary import are to be retained by the exporter and presented to the 
District Director of Customs at the time of import or export for endorsement. If necessary, the export may 
be made through a port other than the one designated on the license if the exporter complies with the 
procedures established by the U.S. Customs Service. Every license will be returned to the Office of 
Defense Trade Controls by the District Director of Customs when the total value or quantity authorized has 
been shipped or when the date of expiration is reached, whichever occurs first. </p>
<p>(b) Before shipping any defense article, the exporter must also file a Shipper's Export Declaration with the 
District Director of Customs at the port of exit (unless otherwise exempt from filing a Shipper's Export 
Declaration). The District Director of Customs at the port of exit must authenticate the Shipper's Export 
Declaration, and endorse the license to show the shipments actually made. The District Director of 
Customs will return a copy of each authenticated Shipper's Export Declaration to the Office of Defense 
Trade Controls. </p>
<p>(c ) Except for the export of unclassified technical data, an exporter must file a Shipper's Export 
Declaration with District Directors of Customs or Postmasters in those cases in which no export license is 
required because of an exemption under this subchapter. The exporter must certify that the export is exempt 
from the licensing requirements of this subchapter by writing 22 CFR (identify section) and 22 CFR 
120.1(b) applicable on the Shipper's Export Declaration, and by identifying the section under which an 
exemption is claimed. A copy of each such declaration must be mailed immediately by the exporter to the 
Office of Defense Trade Controls. </p>
<p>(d) A Shipper's Export Declaration is not required for exports of unclassified technical data. Exporters 
shall notify the Office of Defense Trade Controls of the initial export of the data by either returning the 
license after self endorsement or by sending a letter to the Office of Defense Trade Controls. The letter 
shall provide the method, date, license number and airway bill number (if applicable) of the shipment. The 
letter must be signed by an empowered official of the company and provided to the Office of Defense 
Trade Controls within thirty days of the initial export. </p>
<p>(e) If a license for the export of unclassified defense articles, including technical data, is used but not 
endorsed by U.S. Customs or a Postmaster for whatever reason (e.g., electronic transmission, 
unavailability of Customs officer or Postmaster, etc.), the person exporting the article must self-endorse 
the license, showing when and how the export took place. Every license shall also be returned by the 
exporter to the Office of Defense Trade Controls when the total value or quantity authorized has been 
shipped or when the date of expiration is reached, whichever occurs first. </p>
<p>&#167; <a name="123.23">123.23</a> Monetary value of shipments. </p>
<p>District Directors of Customs shall permit the shipment of defense articles identified on any license when 
the total value of the export does not exceed the aggregate monetary value (not quantity) stated on the 
license by more than ten percent, provided that the additional monetary value does not make the total value 
of the license or other approval for the export of any major defense equipment sold under a contract reach 
$14,000,000 or more, and provided that the additional monetary value does not make defense articles or 
defense services sold under a contract reach the amount of $50,000,000 or more. </p>
<p>&#167; <a name="123.24">123.24</a> Shipments by mail. </p>
<p>A Shipper's Export Declaration must be authenticated before an article is actually sent abroad by mail (see 
&#167;123.22(d)). The postmaster or exporter will endorse each license to show the shipments made. Every 
license must be returned by the exporter to the Office of Defense Trade Controls upon completion of the 
mailings. </p>
<p>&#167; <a name="123.25">123.25</a> Amendments to licenses. </p>
<p>(a) The Office of Defense Trade Controls may approve an amendment to a license for permanent export, 
temporary export and temporary import of unclassified defense articles. A suggested format is available 
from the Office of Defense Trade Controls. </p>
<p>(b) The following types of amendments to a license that will be considered: Addition of U.S. freight 
forwarder or U.S. consignor; change due to an obvious typographical error; change in source of 
commodity; and change of foreign intermediate consignee if that party is only transporting the equipment 
and will not process (e.g., integrate, modify) the equipment. For changes in U.S. dollar value see &#167;123.23. </p>
<p>(c ) The following types of amendments to a license will not be approved: Additional quantity, changes in 
commodity, country of ultimate destination, end-use or end-user, foreign consignee and/or extension of 
duration. The foreign intermediate consignee may only be amended if that party is acting as freight 
forwarder and the export does not involve technical data. A new license is required for these changes. Any 
new license submission must reflect only the unshipped balance of quantity and dollar value. </p>
<p>&#167; <a name="123.26">123.26</a> Recordkeeping requirement for exemptions. </p>
<p>When an exemption is claimed for the export of unclassified technical data, the exporter must maintain a 
record of each such export. The business record should include the following information: A description 
of the unclassified technical data, the name of the recipient end-user, the date and time of the export, and 
the method of transmission. </p>
<p>&#167; <a name="123.27">123.27</a> Temporary export for personal use of Category XIII(b)(1) cryptographic products. </p>
<p>(a) District Directors of Customs may permit a U.S. citizen or a U.S. person who is a lawful permanent 
resident as defined by 8 U.S.C. 1101 (a)(20) to temporarily export from the United States without a license 
not more than one each of any unclassified Category XIII(b)(1) cryptographic hardware product and not 
more than a single copy of each type of unclassified Category XIII(b)(1) cryptographic software product 
provided that: </p>
<p>(1) The software product(s) are to be used only on a simultaneously temporarily exported Category 
XIII(b)(1) hardware product or a simultaneously exported item on the Commerce Control List (CCL); and </p>
<p>(2) The cryptographic products covered by Category XIII(b)(1) are not destined for export to a destination 
listed in Sec. &#167;126.1 of the ITAR (22 CFR126.1) which is prohibited by a United Nations Security 
Council Resolution or to which the export (or for which the issuance of a license for the export) would be 
prohibited by a U.S. statute (e.g., by Section 49 of the Arms Export Control Act, 22 U.S.C. 2780, to 
countries that have been determined to have repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism 
-- currently Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan and Syria); and </p>
<p>(3)(i) The encryption products remain in the possession of the exporting person or the possession of 
another U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident traveling with him/her, or for their exclusive use and not 
for copying, demonstration, marketing, sale, re-export or transfer of ownership or control. The export of 
cryptographic products identified in Category XIII(b)(1) in any other circumstances, for example, those in 
which a person contemplates sales, marketing, or demonstration must be licensed in accordance with 
policies and procedures in this subchapter. </p>
<p>(ii) Special definition. For purposes of paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section, a product is considered to be in 
the possession of the exporter if: </p>
<p>(A) The exporter takes normal precautions to ensure the security of the product by locking the product in a 
hotel room, safe, or other comparably secure location; and </p>
<p>(B) While in transit, the exporter keeps the product in his/her carry-on luggage or locked in baggage 
accompanying the exporter which has been checked with the carrier; and </p>
<p>(4) At the time of export from the U.S. and import into the U.S., the cryptographic products are with the 
individual's accompanying baggage or effects. They may not be exported or imported in unaccompanied 
baggage, mailed or transmitted by any other means (e.g., electronically); and, the cryptographic products 
must be returned to the U.S. at the completion of the stay abroad; and </p>
<p>(5) The exporter, upon request of a U.S. Customs officer, will submit the products to inspection at the time 
of export and/or import. </p>
<p>(b) Use of this exemption requires the exporter, in lieu of filing a Shippers' Export Declaration, to 
maintain, for a period of 5 years form the day of each temporary export, a record of that temporary export 
and the subsequent import. Included in this record must be a self certification that the individual complied 
with the conditions of paragraph (a) of this section and a self certification that he/she has no reason to 
believe that any of the temporarily exported cryptographic products were stolen, lost, copied, sold or 
otherwise compromised or transferred while abroad. The record should include the following information: 
A description of the unclassified cryptographic products; the countries entered, including the dates of entry 
and exit for each foreign country; and, the dates of temporary export from and subsequent import into the 
United States. </p>
<p>(c ) In any instance where a product exported under this exemption is stolen, lost, copied, sold or 
otherwise compromised or transferred while abroad, the exporting person must, within 10 days of hi/her 
return to the United States, report the incident to the Department of State, Office of Defense Trade 
Controls, Washington, D.C. 20520-0602. Also, any person who knows or has reason to know that 
cryptographic products exported under this exemption are being transferred, exported, or used for any 
other activity which must be licensed or otherwise authorized in writing by the Department of State, should 
immediately inform the Department of State, Office of Defense Trade Controls, Washington, D.C. 
205020-0602. </p>

<p>&#167;<a name="124.1">124.1</a> Manufacturing license agreements and technical assistance agreements. </p>
<p>(a) The approval of the Office of Defense Trade Controls must be obtained before the defense services 
described in &#167;120.9(a) of this subchapter may be furnished. In order to obtain such approval, the U.S. 
person must submit a proposed agreement to the Office of Defense Trade Controls. Such agreements are 
generally characterized as either Manufacturing license agreements, technical assistance agreements, 
distribution agreements or off-shore procurement agreements, and may not enter into force without the 
prior written approval of the Office of Defense Trade Controls. Once approved, the defense services 
described in the agreements may generally be provided without further licensing in accordance with Secs. 
124.3 and 125.4(b)(2) of this subchapter. The requirements of this section apply whether or not technical 
data is to be disclosed or used in the performance of the defense services described in &#167;120.9(a) of this 
subchapter (e.g., all the information relied upon by the U.S. person in performing the defense service is in 
the public domain or is otherwise exempt from the licensing requirements of this subchapter pursuant to 
&#167;125.4 of this subchapter). This requirement also applies to the training of any foreign military forces, 
regular and irregular, in the use of defense articles. Technical assistance agreements must be submitted in 
such cases. In exceptional cases, The Office of Defense Trade Controls, upon written request, will 
consider approving the provision of defense services described in &#167;120.9(a) of this subchapter by granting 
a license under part 125 of this subchapter. Also, see &#167;126.8 of this subchapter for the requirements for 
prior approval of proposals relating to significant military equipment. </p>
<p>(b) Classified Articles. Copies of approved agreements involving the release of classified defense articles 
will be forwarded by the Office of Defense Trade Controls to the Defense Investigative Service of the 
Department of Defense. </p>
<p>(c ) Amendments. Changes to the scope of approved agreements, including modifications, upgrades, or 
extensions must be submitted for approval. The amendments may not enter into force until approved by the 
Office of Defense Trade Controls. </p>
<p>(d) Minor Amendments. Amendments which only alter delivery or performance schedules, or other minor 
administrative amendments which do not affect in any manner the duration of the agreement or the clauses 
or information which must be included in such agreements because of the requirements of this part, do not 
have to be submitted for approval. One copy of all such minor amendments must be submitted to the Office 
of Defense Trade Controls within thirty days after they are concluded. </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="124.2">124.2</a> Exemptions for training and military service. </p>
<p>(a) Technical assistance agreements are not required for the provision of training in the basic operation 
and maintenance of defense articles lawfully exported or authorized for export to the same recipient. This 
does not include training in intermediate and depot level maintenance. </p>
<p>(b) Services performed as a member of the regular military forces of a foreign nation by U.S. persons who 
have been drafted into such forces are not deemed to be defense services for purposes of &#167;120.9 of this 
subchapter. </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="124.3">124.3</a> Exports of technical data in furtherance of an agreement. </p>
<p>(a) Unclassified technical data. District Directors of Customs or postal authorities shall permit the export 
without a license of unclassified technical data if the export is in furtherance of a manufacturing license or 
technical assistance agreement which has been approved in writing by the Office of Defense Trade 
Controls and the technical data being exported does not exceed the scope or limitations of the relevant 
agreement. The U.S. party to the agreement must certify on the Shippers Export Declaration that the export 
does not exceed the scope of the agreement and any limitations imposed pursuant to this part. The approval 
of the Office of Defense Trade Controls must be obtained for the export of any unclassified technical data 
which may exceed the terms of the agreement. </p>
<p>(b) Classified technical data. The export of classified information in furtherance of an approved 
manufacturing license or technical assistance agreement which provides for the transmittal of classified 
information does not require further approval from the Office of Defense Trade Controls when: </p>
<p>(1) The United States party certifies to the Department of Defense transmittal authority that the classified 
information does not exceed the technical or product limitations in the agreement; and </p>
<p>(2) The U.S. party complies with the requirements of the Department of Defense Industrial Security 
Manual concerning the transmission of classified information and any other requirements of cognizant U.S. 
departments or agencies. </p>

<p>The following information must be included in all proposed manufacturing license agreements and 
technical assistance agreements. The information should be provided in terms which are as precise as 
possible. If the applicant believes that a clause or that required information is not relevant or necessary, 
the applicant may request the omission of the clause or information. The transmittal letter accompanying 
the agreement must state the reasons for any proposed variation in the clauses or required information. </p>
<p>(1) The agreement must describe the defense article to be manufactured and all defense articles to be

export) or disclosed to a national of another country without the prior written approval of the Office of 
Defense Trade Controls. </p>
<p>(d) The controls of this part apply to the exports referred to in paragraph (a) of this section regardless of 
whether the person who intends to export the technical data produces or manufactures defense articles if 
the technical data is determined by the Office of Defense Trade Controls to be subject to the controls of 
this subchapter. </p>
<p>(e) The provisions of this subchapter do not apply to technical data related to articles in Category VI(e) 
and Category XVI. The export of such data is controlled by the Department of Energy and the Nuclear 
Regulatory Commission pursuant to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and the Nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Act of 1978. </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="125.2">125.2</a> Exports of unclassified technical data. </p>
<p>(a) A license (DSP-5) is required for the export of unclassified technical data unless the export is exempt 
from the licensing requirements of this subchapter. In the case of a plant visit, details of the proposed 
discussions must be transmitted to the Office of Defense Trade Controls for an appraisal of the technical 
data. Seven copies of the technical data or the details of the discussion must be provided. </p>
<p>(b) Patents. A license issued by the Office of Defense Trade Controls is required for the export of 
technical data whenever the data exceeds that which is used to support a domestic filing of a patent 
application or to support a foreign filing of a patent application whenever no domestic application has 
been filed. Requests for the filing of patent applications in a foreign country, and requests for the filing of 
amendments, modifications or supplements to such patents, should follow the regulations of the U.S. Patent 
and Trademark Office in accordance with 37 CFR part 5. The export of technical data to support the filing 
and processing of patent applications in foreign countries is subject to regulations issued by the U.S. Patent 
and Trademark Office pursuant to 35 U.S.C. 184. </p>
<p>(c ) Disclosures. Unless otherwise expressly exempted in this subchapter, a license is required for the 
oral, visual or documentary disclosure of technical data by U.S. persons to foreign persons. A license is 
required regardless of the manner in which the technical data is transmitted (e.g., in person, by telephone, 
correspondence, electronic means, etc.). A license is required for such disclosures by U.S. persons in 
connection with visits to foreign diplomatic missions and consular offices. </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="125.3">125.3</a> Exports of classified technical data and classified defense articles. </p>
<p>(a) A request for authority to export defense articles, including technical data, classified by a foreign 
government or pursuant to Executive Order 12356, successor orders, or other legal authority must be 
submitted to the Office of Defense Trade Controls for approval. The application must contain full details 
of the proposed transaction. It should also list the facility security clearance code of all U.S. parties on the 
license and include the Defense Investigative Service cognizant security office of the party responsible for 
packaging the commodity for shipment. A nontransfer and use certificate (Form DSP-83) executed by the 
applicant, foreign consignee, end-user and an authorized representative of the foreign government involved 
will be required. </p>
<p>(b) Classified technical data which is approved by the Office of Defense Trade Controls either for export 
or reexport after a temporary import will be transferred or disclosed only in accordance with the 
requirements in the Department of Defense Industrial Security Manual. Any other requirements imposed by 
cognizant U.S. departments and agencies must also be satisfied. </p>
<p>(c ) The approval of the Office of Defense Trade Controls must be obtained for the export of technical data 
by a U.S. person to a foreign person in the U.S. or in a foreign country unless the proposed export is 
exempt under the provisions of this subchapter. </p>
<p>(d) All communications relating to a patent application covered by an invention secrecy order are to be 
addressed to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (see 37 CFR 5.11). </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="125.4">125.4</a> Exemptions of general applicability. </p>
<p>(a) The following exemptions apply to exports of unclassified technical data for which approval is not 
needed from the Office of Defense Trade Controls. These exemptions, except for paragraph (b)(13) of this 
section, do not apply to exports to proscribed destinations under &#167;126.1 of this subchapter or for persons 
considered generally ineligible underv&#167; 120.1(c ) of this subchapter. The exemptions are also not 
applicable for purposes of establishing offshore procurement arrangements. If &#167;126.8 of this subchapter 
requirements are applicable, they must be met before an exemption under this section may be used. 
Transmission of classified information must comply with the requirements of the Department of Defense 
Industrial Security Manual and the exporter must certify to the transmittal authority that the technical data 
does not exceed the technical limitation of the authorized export. </p>
<p>(b) The following exports are exempt from the licensing requirements of this subchapter. </p>
<p>(1) Technical data, including classified information, to be disclosed pursuant to an official written request 
or directive from the U.S. Department of Defense; </p>
<p>(2) Technical data, including classified information, in furtherance of a manufacturing license or technical 
assistance agreement approved by the Department of State under part 124 of this subchapter and which 
meet the requirements of &#167;124.3 of this subchapter; </p>
<p>(3) Technical data, including classified information, in furtherance of a contract between the exporter and 
an agency of the U.S. Government, if the contract provides for the export of the data and such data does not 
disclose the details of design, development, production, or manufacture of any defense article; </p>
<p>(4) Copies of technical data, including classified information, previously authorized for export to the same 
recipient. Revised copies of such technical data are also exempt if they pertain to the identical defense 
article, and if the revisions are solely editorial and do not add to the content of technology previously 
exported or authorized for export to the same recipient; </p>
<p>(5) Technical data, including classified information, in the form of basic operations, maintenance, and 
training information relating to a defense article lawfully exported or authorized for export to the same 
recipient. Intermediate or depot-level repair and maintenance information may be exported only under a 
license or agreement approved specifically for that purpose; </p>
<p>(6) Technical data, including classified information, related to firearms not in excess of caliber .50 and 
ammunition for such weapons, except detailed design, development, production or manufacturing 
information; </p>
<p>(7) Technical data, including classified information, being returned to the original source of import; </p>
<p>(8) Technical data directly related to classified information which has been previously exported or 
authorized for export in accordance with this part to the same recipient, and which does not disclose the 
details of the design, development, production, or manufacture of any defense article; </p>
<p>(9) Technical data, including classified information, sent by a U.S. corporation to a U.S. person employed 
by that corporation overseas or to a U.S. Government agency. This exemption is subject to the limitations 
of &#167;125.1(b) and may be used only if: </p>
<p>(i) The technical data is to be used overseas solely by U.S. persons; </p>
<p>(ii) If the U.S. person overseas is an employee of the U.S. Government or is directly employed by the U.S. 
corporation and not by a foreign subsidiary; and </p>
<p>(iii) The classified information is sent overseas in accordance with the requirements of the Department of 
Defense Industrial Security Manual. </p>
<p>(10) Disclosures of unclassified technical data in the U.S. by U.S. institutions of higher learning to foreign 
persons who are their bona fide and full time regular employees. This exemption is available only if: </p>
<p>(i) The employee's permanent abode throughout the period of employment is in the United States; </p>
<p>(ii) The employee is not a national of a country to which exports are prohibited pursuant to 126.1 of this 
subchapter; and </p>
<p>(iii) The institution informs the individual in writing that the technical data may not be transferred to other 
foreign persons without the prior written approval of the Office of Defense Trade Controls; </p>
<p>(11) Technical data, including classified information, for which the exporter, pursuant to an arrangement 
with the Department of Defense, Department of Energy or NASA which requires such exports, has been 
granted an exemption in writing from the licensing provisions of this part by the Office of Defense Trade 
Controls. Such an exemption will normally be granted only if the arrangement directly implements an 
international agreement to which the United States is a party and if multiple exports are contemplated. The 
Office of Defense Trade Controls, in consultation with the relevant U.S. Government agencies, will 
determine whether the interests of the United States Government are best served by expediting exports 
under an arrangement through an exemption (see also paragraph (b)(3) of this section for a related 
exemption); </p>
<p>(12) Technical data which is specifically exempt under part 126 of this subchapter; or </p>
<p>(13) Technical data approved for public release (i.e., unlimited distribution) by the cognizant U.S. 
Government department or agency or Directorate for Freedom of Information and Security Review. This 
exemption is applicable to information approved by the cognizant U.S. Government department or agency 
for public release in any form. It does not require that the information be published in order to qualify for 
the exemption. </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="125.5">125.5</a> Exemptions for plant visits. </p>
<p>(a) A license is not required for the oral and visual disclosure of unclassified technical data during the 
course of a classified plant visit by a foreign person, provided (1) the classified visit has itself been 
authorized pursuant to a license issued by the Office of Defense Trade Controls; or (2) the classified visit 
was approved in connection with an actual or potential government-to-government program or project by a 
U.S. Government agency having classification jurisdiction over the classified defense article or classified 
technical data involved under Executive Order 12356 or other applicable Executive Order; and (3) the 
unclassified </p>
<p>information to be released is directly related to the classified defense article or technical data for which 
approval was obtained and does not disclose the details of the design, development, production or 
manufacture of any other defense articles. In the case of visits involving classified information, the 
requirements of the Defense Industrial Security Manual (Department of Defense Manual 5220.22M) must 
be met. </p>
<p>(b) The approval of the Office of Defense Trade Controls is not required for the disclosure of oral and 
visual classified information to a foreign person during the course of a plant visit approved by the 
appropriate U.S. Government agency if (1) the requirements of the Defense Industrial Security Manual 
have been met, (2) the classified information is directly related to that which was approved by the U.S. 
Government agency, (3) it does not exceed that for which approval was obtained, and (4) it does not

<p>(c ) A license is not required for the disclosure to a foreign person of unclassified technical data during the 
course of a plant visit (either classified or unclassified) approved by the Office of Defense Trade Controls 
or a cognizant U.S. Government agency provided the technical data does not contain information in excess 
of that approved for disclosure. This exemption does not apply to technical data which could be used for 
design, development, production or manufacture of a defense article. </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="125.6">125.6</a> Certification requirements for exemptions. </p>
<p>(a) To claim an exemption for the export of technical data under the provisions of Secs. 125.4 and 125.5, 
an exporter must certify that the proposed export is covered by a relevant paragraph of that section. For 
&#167;125.4, certification consists of marking the package or letter containing the technical data: ``22 CFR 
125.4 (identify subsection) applicable.'' This certification must be made in written form and retained in the 
exporter's files for a period of five years. A Shippers Export Declaration is not required for exports of 
unclassified technical data (see &#167;123.22 (d) of this subchapter. </p>
<p>(b) If a District Director of Customs or Postmaster is unavailable at the time of export, or if the export is 
via oral, visual, or electronic means, the exporter must also complete a written certification as indicated in 
paragraph (a) of this section. </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="125.7">125.7</a> Procedures for the export of classified technical data and other classified defense articles. </p>

<p>Authority: Secs. 2, 38, 40, 42 and 71, Arms Export Control Act, Pub. L. 90-629, 90 Stat. 744 (U.S.C. 
2752, 2778, 2780, 2791 and 2797); E.O. 11958, 41 FR 4311; E.O. 11322, 32 FR 119; 22 U.S.C. 2658; 22 
U.S.C. 287c; E.O. 12918, 59 FR 28205. </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="126.1">126.1</a> Prohibited exports and sales to certain countries. </p>
<p>(a) General. It is the policy of the United States to deny licenses, other approvals, exports and imports of 
defense articles and defense services, destined for or originating in certain countries. This policy applies 
to: Afghanistan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Byelarus, Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Syria, 
Tajikistan and Vietnam. This policy also applies to countries with respect to which the United States 
maintains an arms embargo (e.g., Burma, China, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and 
Montenegro), Haiti, Liberia, Nigeria, Rwanda Somalia, the Sudan, and Zaire) or 
for whenever an export would not otherwise be in furtherance of world peace and the security and foreign 
policy of the United States. Comprehensive arms embargoes are normally the subject of a State 
Department notice published in the Federal Register. The exemptions provided in the regulations in this 
subchapter, except &#167;&#167; 123.17 and 125.4(b)(13) of this subchapter, do not apply with respect to articles 
originating in or for export to any proscribed countries or areas. With regard to section &#167;123.27 the 
exemption does not apply with respect to articles originating in or for export to countries prohibited by a 
United Nations Security Council Resolution or to which the export (or for which the issuance of a license 
for the export) would be prohibited by a U.S. statute (e.g., by Section 40 of the Arms Export Control Act, 
22 U.S.C. 2780), to countries that have been determined to have repeatedly provided support for acts of 
international terrorism, i.e., Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan and Syria. </p>
<p>(b) Shipments. A defense article licensed for export under this subchapter may not be shipped on a vessel, 
aircraft or other means of conveyance which is owned or operated by, or leased to or from, any of the 
proscribed countries or areas. </p>
<p>(c ) Exports and sales prohibited by United Nations Security Council embargoes. Whenever the United 
Nations Security Council mandates an arms embargo, all transactions which are prohibited by the embargo 
and which involve U.S. persons anywhere, or any person in the United States, and defense articles and 
services of a type enumerated on the United States Munitions List (22 CFR part 121), irrespective of 
origin, are prohibited under the ITAR for the duration of the embargo, unless the Department of State 
publishes a notice in the Federal Register specifying different measures. This would include, but is not 
limited to, transactions involving trae by the U.S. perons who are located inside or outside of the United 
States in defense articles and services of U.S. or foreign origin which are located inside or outside the 
United States. </p>
<p>(d) Terrorism. Exports to countries which the Secretary of State has determined to have repeatedly 
provided support for acts of international terrorism are contrary to the foreign policy of the United States 
and are thus subject to the policy specified in paragraph (a) of this section and the requirements of section 
40 of the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2780) and the Omnibus Diplomatic Security and 
Anti-Terrorism Act of 1986 (22 U.S.C. 4801, note). The countries in this category are: Cuba, Iran, Iraq, 
Libya, North Korea and Syria. The same countries are identified pursuant to section 6(j) of the Export 
Administration Act, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2405(j)). </p>
<p>(e) Proposed sales. No sale or transfer and no proposal to sell or transfer any defense articles, defense 
services or technical data subject to this subchapter may be made to any country referred to in this section 
(including the embassies or consulates of such a country), or to any person acting on its behalf, whether in 
the United States or abroad, without first obtaining a license or written approval of the Office of Defense 
Trade Controls. However, in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, it is the policy of the 
Department of State to deny licenses and approvals in such cases. Any person who knows or has reason to 
know of such a proposed or actual sale, or transfer, of such articles, services or data must immediately 
inform the Office of Defense Trade Controls. </p>
<p>(f) Angola. Consistent with U.N. Security Council Resolution 864 of September 15, 1993, an arms 
embargo exists with respect to UNITA. Accordingly, exports subject to this subchapter are prohibited in 
accordance with Security Council Resolution 864, Executive Order 12865 of September 29, 1993m and 
the UNITA (Angola) Sanctions Regulations issued by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, Department of 
the Treasury, on December 10, 1993 (56 FR 64904). </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="126.2">126.2</a> Temporary suspension or modification of this subchapter. </p>
<p>The Director, Office of Defense Trade Controls, may order the temporary suspension or modification of 
any or all of the regulations of this subchapter in the interest of the security and foreign policy of the United 
States. </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="126.3">126.3</a> Exceptions. </p>
<p>In a case of exceptional or undue hardship, or when it is otherwise in the interest of the United States 
Government, the Director, Office of Defense Trade Controls may make an exception to the provisions of 
this subchapter. </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="126.4">126.4</a> Shipments by or for United States Government agencies. </p>
<p>(a) A license is not required for the temporary import, or temporary export, of any defense article, 
including technical data or the performance of a defense service, by or for any agency of the U.S. 
Government (1) for official use by such an agency, or (2) for carrying out any foreign assistance, 
cooperative project or sales program authorized by law and subject to control by the President by other 
means. This exemption applies only when all aspects of a transaction (export, carriage, and delivery 
abroad) are effected by a United States Government agency or when the export is covered by a United 
States Government Bill of Lading. This exemption, however, does not apply when a U.S. Government 
agency acts as a transmittal agent on behalf of a private individual or firm, either as a convenience or in 
satisfaction of security requirements. The approval of the Office of Defense Trade Controls must be 
obtained before defense articles previously exported pursuant to this exemption are permanently 
transferred (e.g., property disposal of surplus defense articles overseas) unless (i) the transfer is pursuant 
to a grant, sale, lease, loan or cooperative project under the Arms Export Control Act or a sale, lease or 
loan under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, or (ii) the defense articles have been rendered 
useless for military purposes beyond the possibility of restoration. </p>
<p>Note: Special definition. For purposes of this section, defense articles exported abroad for incorporation 
into a foreign launch vehicle or for use on a foreign launch vehicle or satellite that is to be launched from a 
foreign country shall be considered a permanent export. </p>
<p>(b) This section does not authorize any department or agency of the U.S. Government to make any export 
which is otherwise prohibited by virtue of other administrative provisions or by any statute. </p>
<p>(c ) A license is not required for the temporary import, or temporary or permanent export, of any classified 
or unclassified defense articles, including technical data or the performance of a defense service, for 
end-use by a U.S. Government Agency in a foreign country under the following circumstances: </p>
<p>(1) The export or temporary import is pursuant to a contract with, or written direction by, an agency of the 
U.S. Government; and </p>
<p>(2) The end-user in the foreign country is a U.S. Government agency or facility, and the defense articles or 
technical data will not be transferred to any foreign person; and </p>
<p>(3) The urgency of the U.S. Government requirement is such that the appropriate export license or U.S. 
Government Bill of Lading could not have been obtained in a timely manner. </p>
<p>(d) A Shipper's Export Declaration (SED), required under &#167;123.22(c ) of this subchapter, and a written 
statement by the exporter certifying that these requirements have been met must be presented at the time of 
export to the appropriate District Director of Customs or Department of Defense transmittal authority. A 
copy of the SED and the written certification statement shall be provided to the Office of Defense Trade 
Controls immediately following the export. </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="126.5">126.5</a> Canadian exemptions. </p>
<p>(a) District Directors of Customs and postmasters shall permit the export or temporary import without a 
license of any unclassified defense article or any unclassified technical data to Canada for end-use in 
Canada by Canadian citizens or return to the United States, or from Canada for end-use in the United States 
or return to a Canadian citizen in Canada, with the exception of the articles or related technical data listed 
in paragraph (b) of this section. </p>
<p>(b) Exceptions. The exemptions of this section do not apply to the following articles and related technical 
data: </p>
<p>(1) Fully automatic firearms in Category I(a) which are not for end-use by the Federal Government, or a 
Provincial or Municipal Government of Canada; </p>
<p>(2) Nuclear weapons strategic delivery systems and all components, parts, accessories, attachments 
specifically designed for such systems and associated equipment; </p>
<p>(3) Nuclear weapon design and test equipment listed in Category XVI; </p>
<p>(4) Naval nuclear propulsion equipment listed in Category VI(e); </p>
<p>(5) Aircraft listed in Category VIII(a); </p>
<p>(6) Submersible and oceanographic vessels and related articles listed in Category XX (a) through (d). </p>
<p>(7) Defense articles, defense services, or related technical data for use by a foreign national other than a 
Canadian. </p>
<p>(c ) Related requirements. The foregoing exemption from obtaining an export license does not exempt an 
exporter from complying with the requirements set forth in &#167;123.15 of this subchapter or from filing the 
Shipper's Export Declaration required by &#167; 123.22 of this subchapter. </p>
<p>(d) Part 124 agreements. The requirements of part 124 of this subchapter must be complied with in the 
situations contemplated in that part. For example, the exemptions of this section may not be used for the 
provision of defense services except pursuant to an approved manufacturing licenseagreement or technical 
assistance agreement. </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="126.6">126.6</a> Foreign-owned military aircraft and naval vessels, and the Foreign Military Sales program. </p>
<p>(a) A license from the Office of Defense Trade Controls is not required if: </p>
<p>(1)(i) The article or technical data to be exported was sold, leased, or loaned by the Department of 
Defense to a foreign country or international organization pursuant to the Arms Export Control Act or the 
Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, and </p>
<p>(ii) The article or technical data was delivered to representatives of such a country or organization in the 
United States; and </p>
<p>(iii) The article or technical data is to be exported from the United States on a military aircraft or naval 
vessel of that government or organization or via the Defense Transportation Service (DTS). </p>
<p>(b) Foreign military aircraft and naval vessels. A license is not required for the entry into the United States 
of military aircraft or naval vessels of any foreign state if no overhaul, repair, or modification of the 
aircraft or naval vessel is to be performed. However, Department of State approval for overflight 
(pursuant to the 49 U.S.C. 1508) and naval visits must be obtained from the Bureau of Politico-Military 
Affairs, Office of International Security Operations. </p>
<p>(c ) Procedures for the Foreign Military Sales Program. (1) District Directors of Customs are authorized 
to permit the export and temporary import of classified and unclassified defense articles, defense services 
and technical data without a license if the articles or technical data were sold, leased or loaned by the U.S. 
Department of Defense to foreign governments or international organizations under the Foreign Military 
Sales (FMS) program of the Arms Export Control Act. This procedure may be used only if a proposed 
export is: </p>
<p>(i) Pursuant to an executed U.S. Department of Defense Letter of Offer and Acceptance (DD Form 1513); 
and </p>
<p>(ii) Accompanied by a properly executed DSP-94, or in the case of a classified shipment, an approved 
Letter of Offer and Acceptance; and </p>
<p>(iii) Made by the relevant foreign diplomatic mission of the purchasing country or its authorized freight 
forwarder, provided that the freight forwarder is registered with the Office of Defense Trade Controls 
pursuant to part 122 of this subchapter, and, if classified defense articles or technical data are involved, 
has the requisite U.S. Government security clearance and a transportation plan has been approved as in 
&#167;126.6(a)(1), above and the defense articles or technical data are shipped in compliance with the 
Department of Defense Industrial Security Manual. </p>

<p>&#167;<a name="126.7">126.7</a> Denial, revocation, suspension or amendment of licenses and other approvals. </p>
<p>(a) Policy. Licenses or approvals shall be denied or revoked whenever required by any statute of the 
United States (see 127.6 and 127.10 of this subchapter). Any application for an export license or other 
approval under this subchapter may be disapproved, and any license or other approval or exemption 
granted under this subchapter may be revoked, suspended, or amended without prior notice whenever: </p>
<p>(1) The Department of State deems such action to be in furtherance of world peace, the national security or 
the foreign policy of the United States, or is otherwise advisable; or </p>
<p>(2) The Department of State believes that 22 U.S.C. 2778, any regulation contained in this subchapter, or 
the terms of any U.S. Government export authorization (including the terms of a manufacturing license or 
technical assistance agreement, or export authorization granted pursuant to the Export Administration Act, 
as amended) has been violated by any party to the export or other person having significant interest in the 
transaction; or </p>
<p>(3) An applicant is the subject of an indictment for a violation of any of the U.S. criminal statutes 
enumerated in &#167;120.27 of this subchapter; or </p>
<p>(4) An applicant or any party to the export or the agreement has been convicted of violating any of the U.S. 
criminal statutes enumerated in &#167;120.27 of this subchapter; or </p>
<p>(5) An applicant is ineligible to contract with, or to receive a license or other authorization to import 
defense articles or defense services from, any agency of the U.S. Government; or </p>
<p>(6) An applicant, any party to the export or agreement, any source or manufacturer of the defense article or 
defense service or any person who has a significant interest in the transaction has been debarred, 
suspended, or otherwise is ineligible to receive an export license or other authorization from any agency 
of the U.S. government (e.g., pursuant to debarment by the Department of Commerce under 15 CFR part 
388 or by the Department of State under part 127 or 128 of this subchapter); or </p>
<p>(7) An applicant has failed to include any of the information or documentation expressly required to 
support a license application or other request for approval under this subchapter or as required in the 
instructions in the applicable Department of State form; or </p>
<p>(8) An applicant is subject to sanctions under other relevant U.S. laws (e.g., the Missile Technology 
Controls title of the National Defense Authorization Act for FY 1991 (Pub. L. 101-510); the Chemical and 
Biological Weapons Control and Warfare Elimination Act of 1991 (Pub. L. 102-182); or the Iran-Iraq 
Arms Non-Proliferation Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102-484)). </p>
<p>(b) Notification. The Office of Defense Trade Controls will notify applicants or licensees or other 
appropriate United States persons of actions taken pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section. The reasons 
for the action will be stated as specifically as security and foreign policy considerations permit. </p>
<p>(c ) Reconsideration. If a written request for reconsideration of an adverse decision is made within 30 
days after a person has been informed of the decision, the U.S. person will be accorded an opportunity to 
present additional information. The case will then be reviewed by the Office of Defense Trade Controls. </p>
<p>(d) Reconsideration of certain applications. Applications for licenses or other requests for approval 
denied for repeated failure to provide information or documentation expressly required will normally not 
be reconsidered during the thirty day period following denial. They will be reconsidered after this period 
only after a final decision is made on whether the applicant will be subject to an administrative penalty 
imposed pursuant to this subchapter. Any request for reconsideration shall be accompanied by a letter 
explaining the steps that have been taken to correct the failure and to ensure compliance with the 
requirements of this subchapter. </p>
<p>(e) Special definition. For purposes of this section, the term party to the export means: </p>
<p>(1) The chief executive officer, president, vice-presidents, other senior officers and officials (e.g., 
comptroller, treasurer, general counsel) and any member of the board of directors of the applicant; </p>
<p>(2) The freight forwarders or designated exporting agent of the applicant; and </p>
<p>(3) Any consignee or end-user of any item to be exported. </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="126.8">126.8</a> Proposals to foreign persons relating to significant military equipment. </p>
<p>(a) Certain proposals to foreign persons for the sale or manufacture abroad of significant military 
equipment require either the prior approval of, or prior notification to, the Office of Defense Trade 
Controls. </p>
<p>(1) Sale of significant military equipment: Prior approval requirement. The approval of the Office of 
Defense Trade Controls is required before a U.S. person may make a proposal or presentation designed to 
constitute a basis for a decision on the part of any foreign person to purchase significant military 
equipment on the U.S. Munitions List whenever all the following conditions are met: </p>
<p>(i) The value of the significant military equipment to be sold is $14,000,000 or more; and </p>
<p>(ii) The equipment is intended for use by the armed forces of any foreign country other than a member of 
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Australia, New Zealand, or Japan; and </p>
<p>(iii) The sale would involve the export from the United States of any defense article or the furnishing 
abroad of any defense service including technical data; and </p>
<p>(iv) The identical significant military equipment has not been previously licensed for permanent export or 
approved for sale under the Foreign Military Sales Program of the Department of Defense, to any foreign 
country. </p>
<p>(2) Sale of significant military equipment: Prior notification requirement. </p>
<p>The Office Defense Trade Controls must be notified in writing at least thirty days in advance of any 
proposal or presentation concerning the sale of significant military equipment whenever the conditions 
specified in paragraphs (a)(1) (i) through (iii) of this section are met and the identical equipment has been 
previously licensed for permanent export or approved for sale under the FMS Program to any foreign 
country. </p>
<p>(3) Manufacture abroad of significant military equipment: Prior approval requirement. The approval of the 
Office of Defense Trade Controls is required before a U.S. person may make a proposal or presentation 
designed to constitute a basis for a decision on the part of any foreign person to enter into any 
manufacturing license agreement or technical assistance agreement for the production or assembly of 
significant military equipment, regardless of dollar value, in any foreign country, whenever: </p>
<p>(i) The equipment is intended for use by the armed forces of any foreign country; and </p>
<p>(ii) The agreement would involve the export from the United States of any defense article or the furnishing 
abroad of any defense service including technical data. </p>
<p>(b) Definition of proposal or presentation. The terms proposal or presentation (designed to constitute a 
basis for a decision to purchase and to enter into any agreement) mean the communication of information in 
sufficient detail that the person communicating that information knows or should know that it would permit 
an intended purchaser to decide either to acquire the particular equipment in question or to enter into the 
manufacturing license agreement or technical assistance agreement. For example, a presentation which 
describes the equipment's performance characteristics, price, and probable availability for delivery would 
require prior notification or approval, as appropriate, where the conditions specified in paragraph (a) of 
this section are met. By contrast, the following would not require prior notification or approval: 
Advertising or other reporting in a publication of general circulation; preliminary discussions to ascertain 
market potential; or merely calling attention to the fact that a company manufactures a particular item of 
significant military equipment. </p>
<p>(c ) Satisfaction of requirements. </p>
<p>(1) The requirement of this section for prior approval is met by any of the following: </p>
<p>(i) A written statement from the Office of Defense Trade Controls approving the proposed sale or 
agreement or approving the making of a proposal or presentation. </p>
<p>(ii) A license issued under &#167;125.2 or &#167;125.3 of this subchapter for the export of technical data relating to 
the proposed sale or agreement to the country concerned. </p>
<p>(iii) A temporary export license issued under &#167;123.5 of this subchapter relating to the proposed sale or 
agreement for a demonstration to the armed forces of the country of export. </p>
<p>(iv) With respect to manufacturing license agreements or technical assistance agreements, the application 
for export licenses pursuant to the two preceding subparagraphs must state that they are related to possible 
agreements of this kind. </p>
<p>(2) The requirement of this section for prior notification is met by informing the Office of Defense Trade 
Controls by letter at least 30 days before making the proposal or presentation. The letter must comply with 
the procedures set forth in paragraph (d) of this section and must identify the relevant license, approval, or 
FMS case by which the identical equipment had previously been authorized for permanent export or sale. 
The Office of Defense Trade Controls will provide written acknowledgment of such prior notification to 
confirm compliance with this requirement and the commencement of the 30-day notification period. </p>
<p>(d) Procedures. Unless a license has been obtained pursuant to &#167;126.8(c)(1) (ii) or (iii), a request for 
prior approval to make a proposal or presentation with respect to significant military equipment, or a 
30-day prior notification regarding the sale of such equipment, must be made by letter to the Office of 
Defense Trade Controls. The letter must outline in detail the intended transaction, including usage of the 
equipment involved and the country (or countries) involved. Seven copies of the letter should be provided 
as well as seven copies of suitable descriptive information concerning the equipment. </p>
<p>(e) Statement to accompany licensing requests. </p>
<p>(1) Every application for an export license or other approval to implement a sale or agreement which 
meets the criteria specified in paragraph (a) of this section must be accompanied by a statement from the 
applicant which either: </p>
<p>(i) Refers to a specific notification made or approval previously granted with respect to the transaction; or </p>
<p>(ii) Certifies that no proposal or presentation requiring prior notification or approval has been made. </p>
<p>(2) The Department of State may require a similar statement from the Foreign Military Sales contractor 
concerned in any case where the United States Government receives a request for a letter of offer for a 
sale which meets the criteria specified in paragraph (a) of this section. </p>
<p>(f) Penalties. In addition to other remedies and penalties prescribed by law or this subchapter, a failure to 
satisfy the prior approval or prior notification requirements of this section may be considered to be a 
reason for disapproval of a license, agreement or sale under the FMS program. </p>
<p>(g) License for technical data. Nothing in this section constitutes or is to be construed as an exemption 
from the licensing requirement for the export of technical data that is embodied in any proposal or 
presentation made to any foreign persons. </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="126.9">126.9</a> Advisory opinions. </p>
<p>Any person desiring information as to whether the Office of Defense Trade Controls would be likely to 
grant a license or other approval for the export of a particular defense article or defense service to a 
particular country may request an advisory opinion from the Office of Defense Trade Controls. These 
opinions are not binding on the Department of State and are revocable. A request for an advisory opinion 
must be made in writing and must outline in detail the equipment, its usage, the security classification (if 
any) of the articles or related technical data, and the country or countries involved. An original and seven 
copies of the letter must be provided along with seven copies of suitable descriptive information 
concerning the defense article or defense service. </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="126.10">126.10</a> Disclosure of information. </p>
<p>(a) Freedom of Information. Subchapter R of this title contains regulations on the availability to the public 
of information and records of the Department of State. The provisions of subchapter R apply to such 
disclosures by the Office of Defense Trade Controls. </p>
<p>(b) Determinations required by law. Section 38 of the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2778) 
provides that certain information required by the Department of State in connection with the licensing 
process may generally not be disclosed to the public unless certain determinations relating to the national 
interest are made in accordance with the procedures specified by that provision. Determinations required 
by section 38(e) shall be made by the Assistant Secretary of State for Politico-Military Affairs. </p>
<p>(c ) Information required under part 130. Part 130 of this subchapter contains specific provisions on the 
disclosure of information described in that part. </p>
<p>(d) National Interest Determinations. In accordance with section 38(e) of the Arms Export Control Act (22 
U.S.C. 2778(e)), the Secretary of State has determined that the following disclosures are in the national 
interest of the United States: </p>
<p>(1) Furnishing information to foreign governments for law enforcement or regulatory purposes; and </p>
<p>(2) Furnishing information to foreign governments and other agencies of the U.S. Government in the context 
of multilateral or bilateral export regimes (e.g., the Missile Technology Control Regime, the Australia 
Group, and COCOM). </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="126.11">126.11</a> Relations to other provisions of law. </p>
<p>The provisions in this subchapter are in addition to, and are not in lieu of, any other provisions of law or 
regulations. The sale of firearms in the United States, for example, remains subject to the provisions of the 
Gun Control Act of 1968 and regulations administered by the Department of the Treasury. The 
performance of defense services on behalf of foreign governments by retired military personnel continues 
to require consent pursuant to Part 3a of this title. Persons who intend to export defense articles or furnish 
defense services should consequently not assume that satisfying the requirements of this subchapter 
relieves one of other requirements of law. </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="126.12">126.12</a> Continuation in force. </p>
<p>All determinations, authorizations, licenses, approvals of contracts and agreements and other action 
issued, authorized, undertaken, or entered into by the Department of State pursuant to section 414 of the 
Mutual Security Act of 1954, as amended, or under the previous provisions of this subchapter, continue in 
full force and effect until or unless modified, revoked or superseded by the Department of State. </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="126.13">126.13</a> Required information. </p>
<p>(a) All applications for licenses (DSP-5, DSP-61, DSP-73, and DSP-85), all requests for approval of 
agreements and amendments thereto under part 124 of this subchapter, all requests for other written 
authorizations, and all 30-day prior notifications of sales of significant military equipment under 126.8(c ) 
must include a letter signed by a responsible official empowered by the applicant and addressed to the 
Director, Office of Defense Trade Controls, stating whether: </p>
<p>(1) The applicant or the chief executive officer, president, vice-presidents, other senior officers or 
officials (e.g., comptroller, treasurer, general counsel) or any member of the board of directors is the 
subject of an indictment for or has been convicted of violating any of the U.S. criminal statutes enumerated 
in &#167;120.27 of this subchapter since the effective date of the Arms Export Control Act, Public Law 94-329, 
90 Stat. 729 (June 30, 1976); </p>
<p>(2) The applicant or the chief executive officer, president, vice-presidents, other senior officers or 
officials (e.g., comptroller, treasurer, general counsel) or any member of the board of directors is </p>
<p>ineligible to contract with, or to receive a license or other approval to import defense articles or defense 
services from, or to receive an export license or other approval from, any agency of the U.S. Government; </p>
<p>(3) To the best of the applicant's knowledge, any party to the export as defined in &#167;126.7(e) has been 
convicted of violating any of the U.S. criminal statutes enumerated in &#167;120.27 of this subchapter since the 
effective date of the Arms Export Control Act, Public Law 94-329, 90 Stat. 729 (June 30, 1976), or is 
ineligible to contract with, or to receive a license or other approval to import defense articles or defense 
services from, or to receive an export license or other approval from any agency of the U.S. government; 
and </p>
<p>(4) The natural person signing the application, notification or other request for approval (including the 
statement required by this subsection) is a citizen or national of the United States, has been lawfully 
admitted to the United States for permanent residence (and maintains such a residence) under the 
Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended (8 U.S.C. 1101(a), section 101(a)20, 60 Stat. 163), or is an 
official of a foreign government entity in the United States. </p>
<p>(b) In addition, all applications for licenses must include, on the application or an addendum sheet, the 
complete names and addresses of all U.S. consignors and freight forwarders, and all foreign consignees 
and foreign intermediate consignees involved in the transaction. If there are multiple consignors, 
consignees or freight forwarders, and all the required information cannot be included on the application 
form, an addendum sheet and seven copies containing this information must be provided. The addendum 
sheet must be marked at the top as follows: ``Attachment to Department of State License From (insert 
DSP-5, 61, 73, or 85, as appropriate) for Export of (insert commodity) valued at (insert U.S. dollar 
amount) to (insert country of ultimate destination).'' The Office of Defense Trade Controls will impress 
one copy of the addendum sheet with the Department of State seal and return it to the applicant with each 
license. The sealed addendum </p>
<p>sheet must remain attached to the license as an integral part thereof. District Directors of Customs and 
Department of Defense transmittal authorities will permit only those U.S. consignors or freight forwarders 
listed on the license or sealed addendum sheet to make shipments under the license, and only to those 
foreign consignees named on the documents. Applicants should list all freight forwarders who may be 
involved with shipments under the license to ensure that the list is complete and to avoid the need for 
amendments to the list after the license has been approved. If there are unusual or extraordinary 
circumstances that preclude the specific identification of all the U.S. consignors and freight forwarders 
and all foreign consignees, the applicant must provide a letter of explanation with each application. </p>
<p>(c ) In cases when foreign nationals are employed at or assigned to security-cleared facilities, provision 
by the applicant of a Technology Control Plan (available from the Defense Investigative Service) will 
facilitate processing. </p>

<p>&#167;<a name="127.1">127.1</a> Violations. </p>
<p>(a) It is unlawful: </p>
<p>(1) To export or attempt to export from the United States any defense article or technical data or to furnish 
any defense service for which a license or written approval is required by this subchapter without first 
obtaining the required license or written approval from the Office of Defense Trade Controls; </p>
<p>(2) To import or attempt to import any defense article whenever a license is required by this subchapter 
without first obtaining the required license or written approval from the Office of Defense Trade Controls; </p>
<p>(3) To conspire to export, import, reexport or cause to be exported, imported or reexported, any defense 
article or to furnish any defense service for which a license or written approval is required by this 
subchapter without first obtaining the required license or written approval from the Office of Defense 
Trade Controls; or </p>
<p>(4) To violate any of the terms or conditions of licenses or approvals granted pursuant to this subchapter. </p>
<p>(b) Any person who is granted a license or other approval under this subchapter is responsible for the acts 
of employees, agents, and all authorized persons to whom possession of the licensed defense article or 
technical data has been entrusted regarding the operation, use, possession, transportation, and handling of 
such defense article or technical data abroad. All persons abroad subject to U.S. jurisdiction who obtain 
temporary custody of a defense article exported from the United States or produced under an agreement 
described in part 124 of this subchapter, and irrespective of the number of intermediate transfers, are 
bound by the regulations of this subchapter in the same manner and to the same extent as the original owner 
or transferer. </p>
<p>(c ) A person with knowledge that another person is then ineligible pursuant to Secs. 120.1(c ) of this 
subchapter or 126.7 of this chapter, is then subject to an order of debarment, or interim suspension, may 
not, directly or indirectly, in any manner or capacity, without prior disclosure of the facts to, and written 
authorization from, the Office of Defense Trade Controls: </p>
<p>(1) Apply for, obtain, or use any export control document as defined in &#167; 127.2(b) for such debarred, 
suspended, or ineligible person; or </p>
<p>(2) Order, buy, receive, use, sell, deliver, store, dispose of, forward, transport, finance, or otherwise 
service or participate in any transaction which may involve any defense article or the furnishing of any 
defense service for which a license or approval is required by this subchapter for export, where such 
debarred, suspended, or ineligible person may obtain any benefit therefrom or have any direct or indirect 
interest therein. </p>
<p>(d) No person may willfully cause, or aid, abet, counsel, demand, induce, procure or permit the 
commission of any act prohibited by, or the omission of any act required by 22 U.S.C. 2778, 22 U.S.C. 
2779, or any regulation, license, approval, or order issued thereunder. </p>

misrepresenting or omitting a material fact for the purpose of exporting any defense article or technical 
data or the furnishing of any defense service for which a license or approval is required by this 
subchapter. Any false statement, misrepresentation, or omission of material fact in an export or temporary 
import control document will be considered as made in a matter within the jurisdiction of a department or 
agency of the United States for the purposes of 18 U.S.C. 1001, 22 U.S.C. 2778 and 22 U.S.C. 2779. </p>

<p>(a) U.S. Customs Service officers may take appropriate action to ensure observance of this subchapter as 
to the export or the attempted export of any defense article or technical data, including the inspection of 
loading or unloading of any vessel, vehicle, or aircraft. This applies whether the export is authorized by 
license or by written approval issued under this subchapter. </p>
<p>(b) U.S. Customs Service officers have the authority to investigate, detain or seize any export or attempted 
export of defense articles or technical data contrary to this subchapter. </p>
<p>(c ) Upon the presentation to a Customs Officer of a license or written approval authorizing the export of 
any defense article, the customs officer may require the production of other relevant documents and 
information relating to the proposed export. This includes an invoice, order, packing list, shipping 
document, correspondence, instructions, and the documents otherwise required by the U.S. Customs 
Service. </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="127.5">127.5</a> Authority of the Defense Investigative Service. </p>
<p>In the case of exports involving classified technical data or defense articles, the Defense Investigative 
Service may take appropriate action to ensure compliance with the Department of Defense Industrial 
Security Manual. Upon a request to the Defense Investigative Service regarding the export of any 
classified defense article or technical data, the Defense Investigative Service official or a designated 
government transmittal authority may require the production of other relevant documents and information 
relating to the proposed export. </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="127.6">127.6</a> Seizure and forfeiture in attempts at illegal exports. </p>
<p>(a) An attempt to export from the United States any defense articles in violation of the provisions of this 
subchapter constitutes an offense punishable under section 401 of title 22 of the United States Code. 
Whenever it is known or there is probable cause to believe that any defense article is intended to be or is 
being or has been exported or removed from the United States in violation of law, such article and any 
vessel, vehicle or aircraft involved in such attempt is subject to seizure, forfeiture and disposition as 
provided in section 401 of title 22 of the United States Code. </p>
<p>(b) Similarly, an attempt to violate any of the conditions under which a temporary export or temporary 
import license was issued pursuant to this subchapter or to violate the requirements of 123.2 of this 
subchapter also constitutes an offense punishable under section 401 of title 22 of the United States Code, 
and such article, together with any vessel, vehicle or aircraft involved in any such attempt is subject to 
seizure, forfeiture, and disposition as provided in section 401 of title 22 of the United States Code. </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="127.7">127.7</a> Debarment. </p>
<p>(a) In implementing section 38 of the Arms Export Control Act, the Assistant Secretary of State for 
Politico-Military Affairs may prohibit any person from participating directly or indirectly in the export of 
defense articles, including technical data or in the furnishing of defense services for which a license or 
approval is required by this subchapter for any of the reasons listed below. Any such prohibition is 
referred to as a debarment for purposes of this subchapter. The Assistant Secretary of State for 
Politico-Military Affairs shall determine the appropriate period of time for debarment, which shall 
generally be for a period of three years. </p>
<p>(b) Grounds. </p>
<p>(1) The basis for a statutory debarment, as described in paragraph (c ) of this section, is any conviction for 
violating the Arms Export Control Act (see &#167;127.3 of this subchapter) or any conspiracy to violate the 
Arms Export Control Act. </p>
<p>(2) The basis for administrative debarment, described in part 128 of this subchapter, is any violation of 22 
U.S.C. 2778 or any rule or regulation issued thereunder when such a violation is of such a character as to 
provide a reasonable basis for the Office of Defense Trade Controls to believe that the violator cannot be 
relied upon to comply with the statute or these rules or regulations in the future, and when such violation is 
established in accordance with part 128 of this subchapter. </p>
<p>(c ) Statutory Debarment. Section 38(g)(4) of the Arms Export Control Act prohibits the issuance of 
licenses to persons who have been convicted of violating the U.S. criminal statutes enumerated in &#167; 120.27 
of this subchapter. Discretionary authority to issue licenses is provided, but only if certain statutory 
requirements are met. It is the policy of the Department of State not to consider applications for licenses or 
requests for approvals involving any person who has been convicted of violating the Arms Export Control 
Act or convicted of conspiracy to violate that Act for a three year period following conviction. Such 
individuals shall be notified in writing that they are debarred pursuant to this policy. A list of persons who 
have been convicted of such offenses and debarred for this reason shall be published periodically in the 
Federal Register. Debarment in such cases is based solely upon the outcome of a criminal proceeding, 
conducted by a court of the United States, that established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt in accordance 
with due process. The procedures of part 128 of this subchapter are not applicable in such cases. </p>
<p>(d) Appeals. Any person who is ineligible pursuant to paragraph (c ) of this section may appeal to the 
Under Secretary of State for International Security Affairs for reconsideration of the ineligibility 
determination. The procedures specified in &#167;128.13 of this subchapter are applicable in such appeals. </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="127.8">127.8</a> Interim suspension. </p>
<p>(a) The Director of the Office of Defense Trade Controls is authorized to order the interim suspension of 
any person when the Director believes that grounds for debarment (as defined in &#167;127.6 of this part) exist 
and where and to the extent the Director finds that interim suspension is reasonably necessary to protect 
world peace or the security or foreign policy of the United States. The interim suspension orders prohibit 
that person from participating directly or indirectly in the export of any defense article or defense service 
for which a license or approval is required by this subchapter. The suspended person shall be notified in 
writing as provided in &#167;127.6(c ) of this part (statutory debarment) or &#167;128.3 of this subchapter 
(administrative debarment), whichever is appropriate. In both cases, a copy of the interim suspension 
order will be served upon that person in the same manner as provided in &#167;128.3 of this subchapter. The 
interim suspension order may be made immediately effective, without prior notice. The order will state the 
relevant facts, the grounds for issuance of the order, and describe the nature and duration of the interim 
suspension. No person may be suspended for a period exceeding 60 days unless proceedings under 
&#167;127.6(c ) of this part or under part 128 of this subchapter, or criminal proceedings, are initiated before 
the expiration of that period. </p>
<p>(b) A motion or petition to vacate or modify an interim suspension order may be filed at any time with the 
Under Secretary of State for International Security Affairs. After a final decision is reached, the Director 
of the Office of Defense Trade Controls will issue an appropriate order disposing of the motion or petition 
and will promptly inform the respondent accordingly. </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="127.9">127.9</a> Applicability of orders. </p>
<p>For the purpose of preventing evasion, orders of the Assistant Secretary of State for Politico-Military 
Affairs, debarring a person under &#167;127.6 and orders of the Director, Office of Defense Trade Controls, 
suspending a person under &#167;127.7 may be made applicable to any other person who may then or thereafter 
(during the term of the order) be related to the debarred person by affiliation, ownership, control, position 
of responsibility, or other commercial connection. Appropriate notice and opportunity to respond to 
charges will be given. </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="127.10">127.10</a> Civil penalty. </p>
<p>(a) The Assistant Secretary of State for Politico-Military Affairs, Department of State, is authorized to 
impose a civil penalty in an amount not to exceed that authorized by 50 U.S.C. App. 2410(c ) for each 
violation of 22 U.S.C. 2778, or any regulation, order, license or approval issued thereunder. This civil 
penalty may be either in addition to, or in lieu of, any other liability or penalty which may be imposed. </p>
<p>(b) The Office of Defense Trade Controls may make: </p>
<p>(1) The payment of a civil penalty under this section or </p>
<p>(2) The completion of any administrative action pursuant to this part 127 or 128 of this subchapter a prior 
condition for the issuance, restoration, or continuing validity of any export license or other approval. </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="127.11">127.11</a> Past violations. </p>
<p>(a) Pursuant to section 38 of the Arms Export Control Act, licenses or other approvals may not be granted 
to persons who have been convicted of violating any of the U.S. criminal statutes enumerated in 120.27 of 
this subchapter or who are ineligible to receive any export licenses from any agency of the U.S. 
government, subject to a narrowly defined statutory exception. This provision establishes a presumption of 
denial for licenses or other approvals involving such persons. This presumption is applied by the Office of 
Defense Trade Controls to all persons convicted or deemed ineligible in this manner since the effective 
date of the Arms Export Control Act (Pub. L. 94-329; 90 Stat. 729) (June 30, 1976). </p>
<p>(b) Policy. An exception to the policy of the Department of State to deny applications for licenses or other 
approvals that involve persons described in paragraph (a) of this section shall not be considered unless 
there are extraordinary circumstances surrounding the conviction or ineligibility to export, and only if the 
applicant demonstrates, to the satisfaction of the Bureau of Politico-Military Affairs, that the applicant has 
taken appropriate steps to mitigate any law enforcement and other legitimate concerns, and to deal with the 
causes that resulted in the conviction, ineligibility, or debarment. Any person described in paragraph (a) of 
this section who wishes to request consideration of any application must explain, in a letter to the 
Director, Office of Defense Trade Controls, the reasons why the application should be considered. If the 
Bureau of Politico-Military Affairs concludes that the application and written explanation have sufficient 
merit, it shall consult with the Office of the Legal Adviser and the Department of the Treasury regarding 
law enforcement concerns, and may also request the views of other departments, including the Department 
of Justice. If the Office of Defense Trade Controls does grant the license or other approval, subsequent 
applications from the same person need not repeat the information previously provided but should instead 
refer to the favorable decision. </p>
<p>(c ) Debarred persons. Persons debarred pursuant to &#167; 127.6(c ) (statutory debarment) may not utilize the 
procedures provided by this section while the debarment is in force. Such persons may utilize only the 
procedures provided by &#167;127.7(d) of this part. </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="127.12">127.12</a> Voluntary disclosures. </p>
<p>(a) General policy. The Department strongly encourages the disclosure of information to the Office of 
Defense Trade Controls by persons, firms or any organization that believe they may have violated any 
export control provision of the Arms Export Control Act, or any regulations, order, license, or other 
authorization issued under the Arms Export Control Act. Voluntary self-disclosure may be considered a 
mitigating factor in determining the administrative penalties, if any, that should be imposed by the 
Department. Failure to report such violation(s) may result in circumstances detrimental to U.S. national 
security and foreign policy interests. </p>
<p>(b) Limitations. (1) The provisions of this section apply only when information is provided to the Office of 
Defense Trade Controls for its review in determining whether to take administrative action under part 128 
of this subchapter concerning violation(s) of the export control provisions of the Arms Export Control Act 
and these regulations. </p>
<p>(2) The provisions of this section apply only when information is received by the Office of Defense Trade 
Controls for review prior to such time that either the Department of State or any other agency, bureau or 
department of the United States Government obtains knowledge of either the same or substantially similar 
information from another source and commenced an investigation or inquiry that involves that information, 
and that is intended to determine whether the Arms Export Control Act or these regulations, or any other 
license, order or other authorization issued under the Arms Export Control Act has been violated. </p>
<p>(3) It is possible that the activity in question -- despite voluntary disclosure -- might merit penalties, 
administrative actions, sanctions, or referrals to the Department of Justice for consideration as to whether 
criminal prosecution is warranted. In the latter case, the Office of Defense Trade Controls will notify the 
Department of Justice of the voluntary nature of the disclosure although the Department of Justice is not 
required to give that fact any weight. The Office of Defense Trade Controls has the sole discretion to 
consider whether ``voluntary disclosure,'' in context with other relevant information in a particular case, 
should be a mitigating factor in determining what, if any, administrative action will be imposed. Some of 
the mitigating factors the Office of Defense Trade Controls may consider are: </p>
<p>(i) Whether the transaction would have been authorized had proper application been made; </p>
<p>(ii) Why the violation(s) occurred; </p>
<p>(iii) The degree of cooperation with the ensuing investigation; </p>
<p>(iv) Whether the person or firm has instituted or improved an internal compliance program to reduce the 
likelihood of future violation(s); </p>
<p>(v) Whether the person making the disclosure did so with the full knowledge and authorization of the firm's 
senior management. (If not, then a firm will not be deemed to have made a disclosure as covered in this 
section.) </p>
<p>(4) The provisions of this section do not, nor should they be relied on, to create, confer, or grant any rights, 
benefits, privileges, or protection enforceable at law or in equity by any person, business, or entity in any 
civil, criminal, administrative, or other matter. </p>
<p>(c ) Notification. (1) Any person or firm wanting to disclose information that constitutes a voluntary 
self-disclosure should, in the manner outlined below, initially notify the Office of Defense Trade Controls 
as soon as possible after violation(s) are discovered and then conduct a thorough review of all 
export-related transactions where violation(s) are suspected. </p>
<p>(2) Notification of violation(s) must be in writing and should include the following information: </p>
<p>(i) A precise description of the nature and extent of the violation(s) (e.g., an unauthorized shipment, doing 
business with a party denied U.S. export privileges, etc.); </p>
<p>(ii) The exact circumstances surrounding the violation(s) (a thorough explanation of why, when, where, 
and how the violation(s) occurred); </p>
<p>(iii) The complete identities and addresses of all individuals and organizations, whether foreign or 
domestic, involved in the activities giving rise to the violation(s); </p>
<p>(iv) Export license numbers, if applicable; </p>
<p>(v) U.S. Defense Trade List category and subcategory, product descriptions, quantities, and characteristics 
of the commodities or technical data involved; </p>
<p>(vi) A description of any corrective actions already undertaken; </p>
<p>(vii) The name and address of the person(s) making the disclosure and a point of contact, if different, 
should further information be needed. </p>
<p>(3) Factors to be considered include, for example, whether the violation(s) were intentional or 
inadvertent; the degree to which the person or firm responsible for the violation(s) making the disclosure 
was familiar with the laws and regulations; and whether the violator was the subject of prior 
administrative or criminal action under the AECA. In addition to immediately providing written 
notification, persons, firms, companies and organizations are strongly urged to conduct a thorough review 
of all export-related transactions where possible violation(s) are suspected. </p>
<p>(d) Documentation. </p>
<p>(1) The written disclosure should be accompanied by copies of those documents that substantiate it. Where 
appropriate, the documentation should include, but is not limited to: </p>
<p>(i) Licensing documents (e.g., license applications, export licenses and end-user statements); </p>
<p>(ii) Shipping documents (e.g., shipper's export declarations, airway bills and bills of lading); </p>
<p>(iii) Any other relevant documents must be retained by the person making the disclosure until the Office of 
Defense Trade Controls requests them or until a final decision on the disclosed information has been 
made. </p>
<p>(e) Certification. A certification must be submitted stating that all of the representations made in 
connection with the voluntary self-disclosure are true and correct to the best of that person's knowledge 
and belief. Certifications made by a firm, corporation or any other organization should be executed by 
someone with the authority to do so. </p>
<p>(f) Oral presentations. It is generally not necessary to augment the written presentation with an oral 
presentation. However, if the person making the disclosure believes a meeting is desirable, a request for 
one should be included with the written presentation. </p>
<p>(g) Voluntary disclosures should be sent to: Compliance Analysis Division, PM/DTC, SA-6, room 200, 
Office of Defense Trade Controls, Bureau of Politico-Military Affairs, U.S. Department of </p>
<p>State, Washington, DC 20522-0602. </p>

<p>Authority: Secs. 2, 38, 40, 42 and 71, Arms Export Control Act. 90 Stat. 744 (22 U.S.C. 2752, 2778, 
2780, 2791, and 2797); E.O. 11958, 42 FR 4311: 22 U.S.C. 2658; E.O. 12291, 46 FR 1981. </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="128.1">128.1</a> Exclusion of functions from the Administrative Procedure Act. </p>
<p>The Arms Export Control Act authorizes the President to control the import and export of defense articles 
and services in furtherance of world peace and the security and foreign policy of the United States. It 
authorizes the Secretary of State to make decisions on whether license applications or other written 
requests for approval shall be granted, or whether exemptions may be used. It also authorizes the Secretary 
of State to revoke, suspend or amend licenses or other written approvals whenever the Secretary deems 
such action to be advisable. The administration of the Arms Export Control Act is a foreign affairs 
function and is thus encompassed within the meaning of the military and foreign affairs exclusion of the 
Administrative Procedure Act and is thereby expressly exempt from various provisions of that Act. 
Because the exercising of the foreign affairs function, including the decisions required to implement the 
Arms Export Control Act, is highly discretionary, it is excluded from review under the Administrative 
Procedure Act. </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="128.2">128.2</a> Administrative Law Judge </p>
<p>The Administrative Law Judge referred to in this part is an Administrative Law Judge appointed by the 
Department of State or of the Department of Commerce, as provided in 15 CFR 788.2. The Administrative 
Law Judge is authorized to exercise the powers and perform the duties provided for in Secs. 127.7, 127.8, 
and 128.3 through 128.16 of this subchapter. </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="128.3">128.3</a> Institution of administrative proceedings. </p>
<p>(a) Charging letters. The Director, Office of Defense Trade Control, with the concurrence of the Office of 
the Legal Adviser, Department of State, may initiate proceedings to impose debarment or civil penalties in 
accordance with &#167;127.7 or &#167;127.10 of this subchapter respectively. Administrative proceedings shall be 
initiated by means of a charging letter. The charging letter will state the essential facts constituting the 
alleged violation and refer to the regulatory or other provisions involved. It will give notice that if the 
respondent to answer the charges with 30 days, as provided in &#167;128.5(a), and indicate that a failure to 
answer will be taken as an admission of the truth of the charges. It will inform the respondent that he or she 
is entitled to an oral hearing if a written demand for one is filed with the answer or within 7 days after 
service of the answer. The respondent will also be informed that he or she may, if so desired, be 
represented by counsel of his or her choosing. Charging letters may be amended from time to time, upon 
reasonable notice. </p>
<p>(b) Service. A charging letter is served upon a respondent: </p>
<p>(1) If the respondent is a resident of the United States, when it is mailed postage prepaid in a wrapper 
addressed to the respondent at that person's last known address; or when left with the respondent or </p>
<p>the agent or employee of the respondent; or when left at the respondent's dwelling with some person of 
suitable age and discretion then residing herein; or </p>
<p>(2) If the respondent is a non-resident of the United States, when served upon the respondent by any of the 
foregoing means. If such methods of service are not practicable or appropriate, the charging letter may be 
tendered for service on the respondent to an official of the government of the country wherein the 
respondent resides, provided that there is an agreement or understanding between the United States 
Government and the government </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="128.4">128.4</a> Default. </p>
<p>(a) Failure to answer. If the respondent fails to answer the charging letter, the respondent may be held in 
default. The case shall then be referred to the Administrative Law Judge for consideration in a manner as 
the Administrative Law Judge may consider appropriate. Any order issued shall have the same effect as an 
order issued following the disposition of contested charges. </p>
<p>(b) Petition to set aside defaults. Upon showing good cause, any respondent against whom a default order 
has been issued may apply to set aside the default and vacate the order entered thereon. The petition shall 
be submitted to duplicate to the Assistant Secretary for Political-Military Affairs, U.S. Department of 
State, 2201 C Street, NW., Washington, DC 20520. The Director will refer the petition to the 
Administrative Law Judge for consideration and a recommendation. The Administrative law Judge will 
consider the application and may order a hearing and require the respondent to submit further evidence in 
support of his or her petition. The filing of a petition to set aside a default does not in any manner affect an 
order entered upon default and such order continues in full force and effect unless a further order is made 
modifying or terminating it. </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="128.5">128.5</a> Answer and demand for oral hearing. </p>
<p>(a) When to answer. The respondent is required to answer the charging letter within 30 days after service. </p>
<p>(b) Contents of answer. An answer must be responsive to the charging letter. It must fully set forth the 
nature of the respondent's defense or defenses. In the answer, the respondent must admit or deny 
specifically each separate allegation of the charging letter, unless the respondent is without knowledge, in 
which case the respondent's answer shall so state and the statement shall operate as denial. Failure to deny 
or controvert any particular allegation will be deemed an admission thereof. The answer may set forth 
such additional or new </p>
<p>matter as the respondent believes support a defense or claim of mitigation. Any defense or partial defense 
not specifically set forth in an answer shall be deemed waived. Evidence offered thereon by the 
respondent at a hearing may be refused except upon good cause being shown. If the respondent does not 
demand an oral hearing, he or she shall transmit, within seven (7) days after the service of his or her 
answer, original or photocopies of all correspondence, papers, records, affidavits, and other documentary 
or written evidence having any bearing upon or connection with the matters in issue. If any such materials 
are in language other than English, translations into English shall be submitted at the same time. </p>
<p>(c) Submission of answer. The answer, written demand for oral hearing (if any) and supporting evidence 
required by Sec. 128.5(b) shall be in duplicate and mailed or delivered to the Office of </p>
<p>Administrative Law Judge, United States Department of Commerce, Room H-6716. 14th Street and 
Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20230. A copy shall be simultaneously mailed to the Director, 
Office of Defense Trade Controls, SA-6, Room 200, Department of State, Washington, DC </p>
<p>20522-0602, or delivered to the 21st street entrance of the Department of State, 2201 C Street, NW., 
Washington, DC addressed to Director, Office of Defense Trade Controls, SA-6, Room 200, Department 
of State, Washington, DC 20522-0602. </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="128.6">128.6</a> Discovery. </p>
<p>(a) Discovery by the respondent. The respondent, through the Administrative Law Judge, may request from 
the Office of Defense Trade Controls any relevant information, not privileged, that may be </p>
<p>necessary or helpful in preparing a defense. The Office of Defense Trade Controls may provide any 
relevant information, not privileged, that may be necessary or helpful in preparing a defense. The Office of 
Defense Trade Controls may supply summaries in place or original documents and may withhold 
information from discovery if the interests of national security or foreign policy so require, or if necessary 
to comply with any statute, executive order or regulation requiring that the information may not be 
disclosed. The respondent may request the Administrative Law Judge to request any relevant information, 
books, records, or other evidence, from any other person or government agency so long as the request is 
reasonable in scope and not unduly burdensome. </p>
<p>(b) Discovery by the Office of Defense Trade Controls. The Office of Defense Trade Controls or the 
Administrative Law Judge may request from the respondent admissions of facts, answers to 
interrogatories, the production of books, records, or other relevant evidence, so long as the request is 
relevant and material, reasonable in scope, and not unduly burdensome. </p>
<p>(c) Subpoenas. At the request of any party, the Administrative Law Judge may issue subpoenas, returnable 
before him, requiring the attendance of witnesses and the production of books, records, and other 
documentary or physical evidence determined by he Administrative Law Judge to be relevant and material 
to the proceedings, reasonable in scope, and not unduly burdensome. </p>
<p>(d) Enforcement of discovery rights. If the Office of Defense Trade Controls fails to provide the 
respondent with information in its possession which is not otherwise available and which is necessary to 
the respondent's defense, the Administrative Law Judge may dismiss the charges on her or his own motion 
or on a motion of the respondent. If the respondent fails to respond with reasonable diligence to the 
requests for discovery by the Office of Defense Trade Controls or the Administrative Law Judge, on her or 
his own motion or motion of the Office of Defense Trade Controls, and upon such notice to the respondent 
as the Administrative Law Judge may direct, may strike respondent's answer and declare the respondent in 
default, or make any other ruling which the Administrative Law Judge deems necessary and just under the 
circumstances. If a third party fails to respond to the request for information, the Administrative Law Judge 
shall consider whether the evidence sought is necessary to a fair hearing, and if it is so necessary that a 
fair hearing may not be held without it, the Administrative Law Judge shall dismiss the charges. </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="128.7">128.7</a> Prehearing conference. </p>
<p>(a)(1) The Administrative Law Judge may, upon his own motion or upon motion of any party, request the 
parties or their counsel to a prehearing conference to consider: </p>
<p>(i) Simplification of issues; </p>
<p>(ii) The necessity of desirability of amendments to pleadings; </p>
<p>(iii) Obtaining stipulations of fact and of documents to avoid </p>
<p>unnecessary proof; or </p>
<p>(iv) Such other matter as may expedite the disposition of the proceeding. </p>
<p>(2) The Administrative Law Judge will prepare a summary of the action agreed upon or taken at the 
conference, and will incorporate therein any written stipulations or agreements made by the parties. </p>
<p>(3) The conference proceedings may be recorded magnetically or taken by a reporter and transcribed, and 
filed with the Administrative Law Judge. </p>
<p>(b) If a conference is impracticable , the Administrative Law Judge may request the parties to correspond 
with the person to achieve the purposes of a conference. The Administrative Law Judge shall prepare a 
summary of action taken as in the case of a conference. </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="128.8">128.8</a> Hearings. </p>
<p>(a) A respondent who had not filed a timely written answer is not entitled to a hearing, and the case may 
be considered by the Administrative Law Judge as provided in Sec. 128.4(a). If any answer is filed, but no 
oral hearing demanded, the Administrative Law Judge may proceed to consider the case upon the written 
pleadings and evidence available. The Administrative Law Judge may provide for the making of the 
record in such manner as the Administrative Law Judge deems appropriate. If respondent answers and 
demands an oral hearing, the Administrative Law Judge, upon due notice, shall set the case for hearing, 
unless a respondent has raised in his answer no issues of material fact to be determined. If respondent fails 
to appear at a scheduled hearing, the hearing nevertheless may proceed in respondent's absence. The 
respondent's failure to appear will not affect the validity of the hearing or any proceedings or action 
thereafter. </p>
<p>(b) The Administrative Law Judge may administer oaths and affirmations. Respondent may be represented 
by counsel. Unless otherwise agreed by the parties and the Administrative Law Judge the proceeding will 
be taken by a reporter or by magnetic recording, transcribed, and filed with the Administrative Law Judge. 
Respondent may examine the transcript and may obtain a copy upon payment of proper costs. </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="128.9">128.9</a> Proceedings before and report of Presiding Official. </p>
<p>(a) The Administrative Law Judge may conform any part of the proceedings before him or her to the 
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The record may be made available in any other administrative or other 
proceeding involving the same respondent. </p>
<p>(b) The Administrative Law Judge, after considering the record, will prepare a written report. The report 
will include findings of fact, findings of law, a finding whether a law or regulation has been violated, and 
the Administrative Law Judge's recommendations. It shall be transmitted to the Assistant Secretary for 
Political-Military Affairs, Department of State. </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="128.10">128.10</a> Disposition of proceedings. </p>
<p>Where the evidence is not sufficient to support the charges, the Director, Office of Defense Trade Controls 
or the Administrative Law Judge will dismiss the charges. Where the Administrative Law Judge finds that 
a violation has been committed, the Administrative Law Judge's recommendation shall be advisory only. 
The Assistant Secretary for Political-Military Affairs will review the record, consider the report of the 
Administrative Law Judge, and make an appropriate disposition of the case. The Director may issue an 
order debarring the respondent from participating in the export of defense articles or technical data or the 
furnishing of defense services as provided in Sec. 127.7 of this subchapter, impose a civil penalty as 
provided in Sec. 127.10 of this subchapter or take such action as the Administrative Law Judge deems 
appropriate. Any debarment order will be effective for the period of time specified therein and may 
contain such additional terms and conditions as are deemed appropriate. A copy of the order together with 
a copy of the Administrative Law Judge's report will be served upon the respondent. </p>
<p>&#167; <a name="128.11">128.11</a> Consent Agreements </p>
<p>(a) The Office of Defense Trade Controls and the respondent may, by agreement, submit to the 
Administrative Law Judge a proposal for the issuance of a consent order. The Administrative Law Judge 
will review the facts of the case and the proposal and may conduct conferences with the parties and may 
require the presentation of evidence in the case. If the Administrative Law Judge does not approve the 
proposal, the Administrative Law Judge will notify the parties and the case will proceed as though no 
consent proposal had been made. If the proposal is approved, the Administrative Law Judge will report 
the facts of the case along with recommendations to the Assistant Secretary for Political-Military Affairs. 
If the Assistant Secretary for Political-Military Affairs does not approve the proposal, the case will 
proceed as though no consent proposal had been made. If the Assistant Secretary for Political-Military 
Affairs approves the proposal, an appropriate </p>
<p>order may be issued. </p>
<p>(b) Cases may also be settled prior to service of a charging letter. In such an event, a proposed charging 
letter shall be prepared, and a consent agreement and order shall be submitted for the approval and 
signature of the Assistant Secretary for Political-Military Affairs, and no action by the Administrative Law 
Judge shall be required. Cases which are settled may not be reopened or appealed. </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="128.12">128.12</a> Rehearings. </p>
<p>The Administrative Law Judge may grant a rehearing or reopen a proceeding at any time for the purpose of 
hearing any relevant and material evidence which was not known or obtainable at the time of the original 
hearing. A report for rehearing or reopening must contain a summary of such evidence, and must explain 
the reasons why it could not have been presented at the original hearing. The Administrative Law Judge 
will inform the parties of any further hearing, and will conduct such hearing and submit a report and 
recommendations in the same manner as provided for the original proceeding (Described in Sec. 128.10). </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="128.13">128.13 </a>Appeals. </p>
<p>(a) Filing of appeals. An appeal must be in writing, and be addressed to and filed with the Under 
Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security Affairs, Department of State, Washington, 
DC 20520. An appeal from a final order denying export privileges or imposing civil penalties must be 
filed within 30 days after receipt of a copy of the order. If the Under Secretary cannot for any reason act on 
the appeal, he or she may designate another Department of State official to receive and act on the appeal. </p>
<p>(b) Grounds and conditions for appeal. The respondent may appeal from the debarment or from the 
imposition of a civil penalty (except the imposition of civil penalties pursuant to a consent order pursuant 
to &#167;128.11) upon the ground: (1) That the findings of a violation are not supported by any substantial 
evidence; (2) that a prejudicial error of law was committed: or (3) that the provisions of the order are 
arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion. The appeal must specify upon which of these grounds the 
appeal is based and must indicate from which provisions of the order the appeal is taken. An appeal from 
an order issued upon default will not be entertained if the respondent has failed to seek relief as provided 
in &#167;128.4(b). </p>
<p>(c) Matters considered on appeal. An appeal will be considered upon the basis of the assembled record. 
This record consists of (but is not limited to) the charging letter, the respondent's answer, the transcript or 
magnetic recording of the hearing before the Administrative Law Judge, the report of the Administrative 
Law Judge, the order of the Assistant Secretary for Political-Military Affairs, and any other relevant 
documents involved in the proceedings before the Administrative Law Judge. The Under Secretary of State 
for Arms Control and International Security Affairs may direct a rehearing and reopening before the 
Administrative </p>
<p>Law Judge if he or she finds that the record is insufficient or that new evidence is relevant and material to 
the issues and was not known and was not available to the respondent at the time of the original hearings. </p>
<p>(d) Effect of appeals. The taking of an appeal will not stay the operation of any order. </p>
<p>(e) Preparation of appeals.--(1) General requirements. An appeal shall be in letter form. The appeal and 
accompanying material should be filed in duplicate, unless otherwise indicated, and a copy simultaneously 
mailed to the Director, Office of Defense Trade Controls, SA-6, Room 200, Department of State, 
Washington, DC 20522-0620 or delivered to the 21st street entrance of the Department of State, 2201 C 
Street, NW., Washington, DC addressed to Director, Office of Defense Trade Controls, SA-6, Room 200, 
Department of State, Washington, DC 20522-0602. </p>
<p>(2) Oral presentation. The Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security Affairs 
may grant the appellant an opportunity for oral argument and will set the time and place for oral argument 
and will notify the parties, ordinarily at least 10 days before the date set. </p>
<p>(f) Decisions. All appeals will be considered and decided within a reasonable time after they are filed. 
An appeal may be granted or denied in whole or in part, or dismissed at the request of the appellant. The 
decision of the Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security Affairs will be final. </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="128.14">128.14</a> Confidentiality of proceedings. </p>
<p>Proceedings under this part are confidential. The documents referred to in Sec. 128.17 are not, however, 
deemed to be confidential. Reports of the Administrative Law Judge and copies of transcripts or </p>
<p>recordings of hearings will be available to parties and, to the extent of their own testimony, to witnesses. 
All records are available to any U.S. Government agency showing a proper interest therein. </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="128.15">128.15</a> Orders containing probationary periods. </p>
<p>(a) Revocation of probationary periods. A debarment or interim suspension order may set a probationary 
period during which the order may be held in abeyance for all or part of the debarment or suspension 
period, subject to the conditions stated therein. The Director, Office of Defense Trade Controls, may apply 
without notice to any person to be affected thereby, to the Administrative Law Judge for an order revoking 
probation when it appears that the conditions of the probation have </p>
<p>been breached. The facts in support of the application will be presented to the Administrative Law Judge, 
who will report thereon and make a recommendation to the Assistant Secretary for Political-Military 
Affairs. The latter will make a determination whether to revoke probation and will issue an appropriate 
order. </p>
<p>(b) Hearings--(1) Objections upon notice. Any person affected by an application upon notice to revoke 
probation, within the time specified in the notice, may file objections with the Administrative Law Judge. </p>
<p>(2) Objections to order without notice. Any person adversely affected by an order revoking probation, 
without notice may request that the order be set aside by filing his objections thereto with the 
Administrative Law Judge. The request will not stay the effective date of the order or revocation. </p>
<p>(3) Requirements for filing objections. Objections filed with the Administrative Law Judge must be 
submitted in writing and in duplicate. A copy must be simultaneously submitted to the Office of Defense 
Trade Controls. Denials and admissions, as well as any mitigating circumstances, which the person 
affected intends to present must be set forth in or accompany the letter of objection and must be supported 
by evidence. A request for an oral hearing may be made at the time of filing objections. </p>
<p>(4) Determination. The application and objections thereto will be referred to the Administrative Law 
Judge. An oral hearing if requested, will be conducted at an early convenient date, unless the objections 
filed raise no issues of material fact to be determined. The Administrative Law Judge will report the facts 
and make a recommendation to the Assistant Secretary for Political-Military Affairs, who will determine 
whether the application should be granted or denied and will issue an appropriate order. A copy of the 
order and of the Administrative Law Judge's report will be furnished to any person affected thereby. </p>
<p>(5) Effect of revocation on other actions. The revocation of a probationary period will not preclude any 
other action concerning a further violation, even where revocation is based on the further violation. </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="128.16">128.16</a> Extension of time. </p>
<p>The Administrative Law Judge, for good cause shown, may extend the time within which to prepare and 
submit an answer to a charging letter or to perform any other act required by this part. </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="128.17">128.17</a> Availability of orders. </p>
<p>All charging letters, debarment orders, orders imposing civil penalties, probationary periods, and interim 
suspension orders are available for public inspection in the Public Reading Room of the Department of 
State. </p>

<p>Authority: Sec. 39, Arms Export Control Act, 90 Stat. 767 (22 U.S.C. 2779); E.O. 11958, 42 FR 4311, 3 
CFR, 1977 Comp. P. 79; 22 U.S.C. 2658. </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="130.1">130.1</a> Purpose. </p>
<p>Section 39(a) of the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2779) provides that the Secretary of State shall 
prescribe regulations with respect to reporting on certain payments relating to sales of defense articles and 
defense services. The provisions of this part implement that requirement. </p>
<p>Definitions which apply to this part are contained in Secs. 130.2 through 130.8. </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="130.2">130.2</a> Applicant. </p>
<p>Applicant means any person who applies to the Office of Defense Trade Controls for any license or 
approval required under this subchapter for the export of defense articles or defense services valued in an 
amount of $500,000 or more which are being sold commercially to or for the use of the armed forces of a 
foreign country or international organization. This term also includes a person to whom the required 
license or approval has been given. </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="130.3">130.3</a> Armed forces. </p>
<p>Armed forces means the army, navy, marine, air force, or coast guard, as well as the national guard and 
national police, of a foreign country. This term also includes any military unit or military personnel 
organized under or assigned to an international organization. </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="130.4">130.4</a> Defense articles and defense services. </p>
<p>Defense articles and defense services have the meaning given those terms in paragraphs (3), (4) and (7) of 
section 47 of the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2794 (3), (4), and (7)). When used with reference to 
commercial sales, the definitions in Secs. 120.6 and 120.9 of this subchapter apply. </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="130.5">130.5</a> Fee or commission. </p>
<p>(a) Fee or commission means, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, any loan, gift, donation 
or other payment of $1,000 or more made, or offered or agreed to be made directly or indirectly, whether 
in cash or in kind, and whether or not pursuant to a written contract, which is: </p>
<p>(1) To or at the direction of any person, irrespective of nationality, whether or not employed by or 
affiliated with an applicant, a supplier or a vendor; and </p>
<p>(2) For the solicitation or promotion or otherwise to secure the conclusion of a sale of defense articles or 
defense services to or for the use of the armed forces of a foreign country or international organization. </p>
<p>(b) The term fee or commission does not include: </p>
<p>(1) A political contribution or a payment excluded by &#167;130.6 from the definition of political contribution: </p>
<p>(2) A normal salary (excluding contingent compensation) established at an annual rate and paid to a 
regular employee of an applicant, supplier or vendor; </p>
<p>(3) General advertising or promotional expenses not directed to any particular sale or purchaser; or </p>
<p>(4) Payments made, or offered or agreed to be made, solely for the purchase by an applicant, supplier or 
vendor of specific goods or technical, operational or advisory services, which payments are not 
disproportionate in amount with the value of the specific goods or services actually furnished. </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="130.6">130.6</a> Political contribution. </p>
<p>Political contribution means any loan, gift, donation or other payment of $1,000 or more made, or offered 
or agreed to be made, directly or indirectly, whether in cash or in kind, which is: </p>
<p>(a) To or for the benefit of, or at the direction of, any foreign candidate, committee, political party, 
political faction, or government or governmental subdivision, or any individual elected, appointed or 
otherwise designated as an employee or officer thereof; and </p>
<p>(b) For the solicitation or promotion or otherwise to secure the conclusion of a sale of defense articles or 
defense services to or for the use of the armed forces of a foreign country or international organization. 
Taxes, customs duties, license fees, and other charges required to be paid by applicable law or regulation 
are not regarded as political contributions. </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="130.7">130.7 </a>Supplier. </p>
<p>Supplier means any person who enters into a contract with the Department of Defense for the sale of 
defense articles or defense services valued in an amount of $500,000 or more under section 22 of the 
Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2762). </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="130.8">130.8</a> Vendor. </p>
<p>Vendor means any distributor or manufacturer who, directly or indirectly, furnishes to an applicant or 
supplier defense articles valued in an amount of $500,000 or more which are end-items or major 
components as defined in &#167; 121.8 of this subchapter. It also means any person who, directly or indirectly, 
furnishes to an applicant or supplier defense articles or services valued in an amount of $500,000 or more 
when such articles or services are to be delivered (or incorporated in defense articles or defense services 
to be delivered) to or for the use of the armed forces of a foreign country or international organization 
under: </p>
<p>(1) A sale requiring a license or approval from the Office of Defense Trade Controls under this 
subchapter; or </p>
<p>(2) A sale pursuant to a contract with the Department of Defense under section 22 of the Arms Export 
Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2762). </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="130.9">130.9</a> Obligation to furnish information to the Office of Defense Trade Controls. </p>
<p>(a)(1) Each applicant must inform the Office of Defense Trade Controls as to whether applicant or its 
vendors have paid, or offered or agreed to pay, in respect of any sale for which a license or approval is 
requested: </p>
<p>(i) Political contributions in an aggregate amount of $5,000 or more, or </p>
<p>(ii) Fees or commissions in an aggregate amount of $100,000 or more. </p>
<p>If so, applicant must furnish to the Office of Defense Trade Controls the information specified in &#167;130.10. 
The furnishing of such information or an explanation satisfactory to the Director of the Office of Defense 
Trade Controls as to why all the information cannot be furnished at that time is a condition precedent to the 
granting of the relevant license or approval. </p>
<p>(2) The requirements of this paragraph do not apply in the case of an application with respect to a sale for 
which all the information specified in &#167;130.10 which is required by this section to be reported shall 
already have been furnished. </p>
<p>(b) Each supplier must inform the Office of Defense Trade Controls as to whether the supplier or its 
vendors have paid, or offered or agreed to pay, in respect of any sale: </p>
<p>(1) Political contributions in an aggregate amount of $5,000 or more, or </p>
<p>(2) Fees or commissions in an aggregate amount of $100,000 or more. </p>
<p>If so, supplier must furnish to the Office of Defense Trade Controls the information specified in &#167;130.10. 
The information required to be furnished pursuant to this paragraph must be so furnished no later than 30 
days after the contract award to such supplier, or such earlier date as may be specified by the Department 
of Defense. For purposes of this paragraph, a contract award includes a purchase order, exercise of an 
option, or other procurement action requiring a supplier to furnish defense articles or defense services to 
the Department of Defense for the purposes of section 22 of the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 
2762). </p>
<p>(c ) In determining whether an applicant or its vendors, or a supplier or its vendors, as the case may be, 
have paid, or offered or agreed to pay, political contributions in an aggregate amount of $5,000 or more in 
respect of any sale so as to require a report under this section, there must be included in the computation of 
such aggregate amount any political contributions in respect of the sale which are paid by or on behalf of, 
or at the direction of, any person to whom the applicant, supplier or vendor has paid, or offered or agreed 
to pay, a fee or commission in respect of the sale. Any such political contributions are deemed for 
purposes of this part to be political contributions by the applicant, supplier or vendor who paid or offered 
or agreed to pay the fee or commission. </p>
<p>(d) Any applicant or supplier which has informed the Office of Defense Trade Controls under this section 
that neither it nor its vendors have paid, or offered or agreed to pay, political contributions or fees or 
commissions in an aggregate amount requiring the information specified in &#167; 130.10 to be furnished, must 
subsequently furnish such information within 30 days after learning that it or its vendors had paid, or 
offered or agreed to pay, political contributions or fees or commissions in respect of a sale in an aggregate 
amount which, if known to applicant or supplier at the time of its previous communication with the Office 
of Defense Trade Controls, would have required the furnishing of information under &#167;130.10 at that time. 
Any report furnished under this paragraph must, in addition to the information specified in &#167;130.10, 
include a detailed statement of the reasons why applicant or supplier did not furnish the information at the 
time specified in paragraph (a) or paragraph (b) of this section, as applicable. </p>
<p><a name="130.10">&#167;130.10</a> Information to be furnished by applicant or supplier to the Office of Defense Trade Controls. </p>
<p>(a) Every person required under &#167;130.9 to furnish information specified in this section in respect to any 
sale must furnish to the Office of Defense Trade Controls: </p>
<p>(1) The total contract price of the sale to the foreign purchaser; </p>
<p>(2) The name, nationality, address and principal place of business of the applicant or supplier, as the case 
may be, and, if applicable, the employer and title; </p>
<p>(3) The name, nationality, address and principal place of business, and if applicable, employer and title of 
each foreign purchaser, including the ultimate end-user involved in the sale; </p>
<p>(4) Except as provided in paragraph (c ) of this section, a statement setting forth with respect to such sale: </p>
<p>(i) The amount of each political contribution paid, or offered or agreed to be paid, or the amount of each 
fee or commission paid, or offered or agreed to be paid; </p>
<p>(ii) The date or dates on which each reported amount was paid, or offered or agreed to be paid; </p>
<p>(iii) The recipient of each such amount paid, or intended recipient if not yet paid; </p>
<p>(iv) The person who paid, or offered or agreed to pay such amount; and </p>
<p>(v) The aggregate amounts of political contributions and of fees or commission, respectively, which shall 
have been reported. </p>
<p>(b) In responding to paragraph (a)(4) of this section, the statement must: </p>
<p>(1) With respect to each payment reported, state whether such payment was in cash or in kind. If in kind, it 
must include a description and valuation thereof. Where precise amounts are not available because a 
payment has not yet been made, an estimate of the amount offered or agreed to be paid must be provided; </p>
<p>(2) With respect to each recipient, state: </p>
<p>(i) Its name; </p>
<p>(ii) Its nationality; </p>
<p>(iii) Its address and principal place of business; </p>
<p>(iv) Its employer and title; and </p>
<p>(v) Its relationship, if any, to applicant, supplier, or vendor, and to any foreign purchaser or end-user. </p>
<p>(c ) In submitting a report required by &#167;130.9, the detailed information specified in paragraph (a)(4) and 
(b) of this section need not be included if the payments do not exceed: </p>
<p>(1) $2,500 in the case of political contributions; and </p>
<p>(2) $50,000 in the case of fees or commissions. </p>
<p>In lieu of reporting detailed information with respect to such payments, the aggregate amount thereof must 
be reported, identified as miscellaneous political contributions or miscellaneous fees or commissions, as 
the case may be. </p>
<p>(d) Every person required to furnish the information specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section 
must respond fully to each subdivision of those paragraphs and, where the correct response is none or not 
applicable,'' must so state. </p>
<p><a name="130.11">&#167;130.11</a> Supplementary reports. </p>
<p>(a) Every applicant or supplier who is required under &#167;130.9 to furnish the information specified in 
130.10 must submit a supplementary report in connection with each sale in respect of which applicant or 
supplier has previously been required to furnish information if: </p>
<p>(1) Any political contributions aggregating $2,500 or more or fees or commissions aggregating $50,000 or 
more not previously reported or paid, or offered or agreed to be paid by applicant or supplier or any 
vendor; </p>
<p>(2) Subsequent developments cause the information initially reported to be no longer accurate or complete 
(as in the case where a payment actually made is substantially different in amount from a previously 
reported estimate of an amount offered or agreed to be paid); or </p>
<p>(3) Additional details are requested by the Office of Defense Trade Controls with respect to any 
miscellaneous payments reported under &#167;130.10(c). </p>
<p>(b) Supplementary reports must be sent to the Office of Defense Trade Controls within 30 days after the 
payment, offer or agreement reported therein or, when requested by the Office of Defense Trade Controls, 
within 30 days after such request, and must include: </p>
<p>(1) Any information specified in &#167;130.10 required or requested to be reported and which was not 
previously reported; and </p>
<p>(2) The Defense Trade Control license number, if any, and the Department or Defense contract number, if 
any, related to the sale. </p>
<p><a name="130.12">&#167;130.12</a> Information to be furnished by vendor to applicant or supplier. </p>
<p>(a) In order to determine whether it is obliged under &#167;130.9 to furnish the information specified in &#167;130.10 
with respect to a sale, every applicant or supplier must obtain from each vendor, from or through whom 
the applicant acquired defense articles or defense services forming the whole or a part of the sale, a full 
disclosure by the vendor of all political contributions or fees or commission paid, by vendor with respect 
to such sale. Such disclosure must include responses to all the information pertaining to vendor required to 
enable applicant or supplier, as the case may be, to comply fully with Secs.130.9 and 130.10. If so 
required, they must include the information furnished by each vendor in providing the information 
specified. </p>
<p>(b) Any vendor which has been requested by an applicant or supplier to furnish an initial statement under 
paragraph (a) of this section must, except as provided in paragraph (c ) of this section, furnish such 
statement in a timely manner and not later than 20 days after receipt of such request. </p>
<p>(c ) If the vendor believes that furnishing information to an applicant or supplier in a requested statement 
would unreasonably risk injury to the vendor's commercial interests, the vendor may furnish in lieu of the 
statement an abbreviated statement disclosing only the aggregate amount of all political contributions and 
the aggregate amount of all fees or commissions which have been paid, or offered or agreed to be paid, or 
offered or agreed to be paid, by the vendor with respect to the sale. Any abbreviated statement furnished to 
an applicant or supplier under this paragraph must be accompanied by a certification that the requested 
information has been reported by the vendor directly to the Office of Defense Trade Controls. The vendor 
must simultaneously report fully to the Office of Defense Trade Controls all information which the vendor 
would otherwise have been required to report to the applicant or supplier under this section. Each such 
report must clearly identify the sale with respect to which the reported information pertains. </p>
<p>(d)(1) If upon the 25th day after the date of its request to vendor, an applicant or supplier has not received 
from the vendor the initial statement required by paragraph (a) of this section, the applicant or supplier 
must submit to the Office of Defense Trade Controls a signed statement attesting to: </p>
<p>(i) The manner and extent of applicant's or supplier's attempt to obtain from the vendor the initial statement 
required under paragraph (a) of this section; </p>
<p>(ii) Vendor's failure to comply with this section; and </p>
<p>(iii) The amount of time which has elapsed between the date of applicant's or supplier's request and the 
date of the signed statement; </p>
<p>(2) The failure of a vendor to comply with this section does not relieve any applicant or supplier 
otherwise required by 130.9 to submit a report to the Office of Defense Trade Controls from submitting 
such a report. </p>
<p><a name="130.13">&#167;130.13</a> Information to be furnished to applicant, supplier or vendor by a recipient of a fee or commission. </p>
<p>(a) Every applicant or supplier, and each vendor thereof; </p>
<p>(1) In order to determine whether it is obliged under &#167;130.9 or &#167;130.12 to furnish information specified in 
&#167;130.10 with respect to a sale; and </p>
<p>(2) Prior to furnishing such information, must obtain from each person, if any, to whom it has paid, or 
offered or agreed to pay, a fee or commission in respect of such sale, a timely statement containing a full 
disclosure by such a person of all political contributions paid, or offered or agreed to be paid, by it or on 
its behalf, or at its direction, in respect of such sale. Such disclosure must include responses to all the 
information required to enable the applicant, supplier or vendor, as the case may be, to comply fully with 
Secs. 130.9, 130.10, and 130.12. </p>
<p>(b) In obtaining information under paragraph (a) of this section, the applicant, supplier or vendor, as the

<h2>From Allan's Desk</h2>
<p>I know it&#146;s hard to believe but it is true, I finally
arrived at CSL. Hopefully, your level of relief coincides with my
level of exhilaration at taking on a new challenge -- one that
promises new directions for the company. I hope to provide you
with new insights and perspectives in addressing licensing and
other concerns.</p>
<p>After 32 years of government service, I am ready for the
exciting challenge of the private sector and the possibilities
therein. I feel fortunate to be a part of CSL and work with so
many leading-edge companies.</p>
<p>My first priority in this period of transition is to establish
the ties with you that I am sure will develop into a long and
fruitful business relationship. I have enjoyed conversing with
you and I look forward to playing an important role in furthering
your export interests.</p>
<p>The timing of CSL&#146;s annual seminar couldn&#146;t be
better. It will enable me to meet many of you first-hand and give
us the opportunity to discuss mutual concerns in a constructive
and relaxed fashion. In the meantime, all of us at CSL look
forward to doing whatever we can to assist you. Please do not
hesitate to call.</p>

<h2>Executive Notes</h2>
<p><strong>EAR UPDATE</strong><br>
The Bureau of Export Administration will publish a notice (in the
next few weeks) in the Federal Register extending the deadline
for compliance with the new EAR to December 31, 1996. In
addition, BXA will publish a notice debundling the LST exception:
if using LVS, GBS, CIV, TSR, CTP write that abbreviation on the
Shipper&#146;s Export Declaration instead of LST. Also, the
sub-abbreviations (such as PTS for spare parts under the category
RPL replacement spare parts) are eliminated.</p>
<p><strong>22 CFR 126.1 CHANGES . . . AGAIN!</strong><br>
The State Department issued the official notice on August 12
removing the Ukraine from the list of proscribed destinations
listed at 22 CFR 126.1(a). Now applications for the Ukraine will
be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p><strong>SLOVENIA MAY BE ADDED TO FIRST-TIER LIST</strong><br>
Secretary of Defense William Perry may show support for including
Slovenia in the first tier of nations to be eligible for NATO
expansion. NATO expansion will be discussed at the next meeting
of NATO participants in December.</p>
<p><strong>ENCRYPTION WEEK<br>
</strong>Several industry associations joined forces to sponsor
&quot;CRYPTO-ACTION WEEK,&quot; September 3-10, 1996, to mobilize
support in favor of the liberalization of national encryption
policy. The Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT), Electronic
Freedom Foundation (EFF), the Electronic Privacy Information
Center (EPIC) and Wired Magazine encourage participation in two
ways: sign the petition at http://www.crypto.com/ petition, and
make an appointment with a congressperson&#146;s local office to
discuss the issue. These groups hope to put pressure on the House
and Senate to bring cryptography bills to the floor: the
Burns/Leahy Pro-CODE bill awaits a vote by the Senate Commerce
Committee; and, the Goodlate bill, HR 3011, awaits a hearing by
the House Judiciary Committee. The Clinton Administration opposes
both bills.</p>
<h3>CLINTON MAY REVERSE POLICY ON SOUTH AMERICA</h3>
<p>According to the Dallas Morning News and The Washington Post
President Clinton may reverse the US policy on the sale of
advanced weapons to South America in order to gain votes. The
sale of Lockheed- Martin-made F-16s to Chile and Brazil could
create thousands of jobs and increase Clinton&#146;s popularity
in Texas. Chile wants to buy 20-odd fighters and Brazil may be in
the market for up to 150. 200 export sales translates to $4
billion in exports and 4,000 jobs. </p>
<p>South American policy is a hot issue in the Administration and
has been under internal debate for many months. Also, arms policy
towards South America may become a campaign issue: the relaxation
of controls is part of the Republican platform.</p>
<p>International opinions on the proposed change are mixed.
Brazil, Chile and Peru strongly favor the proposed new policy.
Argentina, on the other hand, urged the administration not to
change the policy as it would lead to an arms race in the region. </p>
<p>The current policy debate may prevent US firms from competing
in Brazil&#146;s fighter contest, possibly worth $5.2 billion for
72 aircraft. Brazil is interested in F-16 and Navy F/A-18
fighters, but it is unclear whether Clinton will allow the sale.
It is quickly becoming a policy test case.</p>
<p>The issue of sales to Peru is a fiery topic considering its
recent border conflict with Ecuador. US negotiators are trying to
resolve the dispute and do not want to alienate either side with
the arms issue.</p>
<p>Last month Defense Secretary William Perry urged to Clinton to
end the ban, but Secretary of State, Warren Christopher said the
ban is necessary because of regional instability. Indeed,
Christopher hopes to broach restraint in conventional arms sales
to Latin America through the Wassenaar Arrangement.</p>
<h3>1995 ARMS SALES TOTALS SURPRISE</h3>
<p>The total of world arms sales fell in 1995 to $28.8 billion,
the lowest level since the Cold War. Russia&#146;s total sales
topped $9 billion, a sharp increase from the $3.8 billion total
in 1994. China accounted for the majority of purchases, acquiring
S7-27 fighter planes and Kilo-class attack submarines. The US
total was $8.2 billion, down from $12.8 billion in 1994.
France&#146;s total also declined sharply from $8.9 billion in
1994 to $3.8 billion in 1995.</p>
<p>For the first time since the break-up of the Soviet Union,
Russia sold more arms to developing countries last year than any
other supplier, with a commitment for $6 billion worth of
munitions items. However, Russia&#146;s willingness to use
incentives and offsets may lead to long-term problems. According
to Defense News, the high level of technology transferred, and
the skill-level of the purchasing countries (China, India, etc.)
will probably lead to those countries manufacturing the
equipment. </p>
<p>The US Government came in second, with $3.789 billion and
France, third with $2.4 billion. These totals include all
government transfers to countries excluding the US, Russia,
nations of the European Union, Canada, Japan, Australia and New
Zealand.</p>
<h3>IRAN LIBYA SANCTIONS CONTROVERSY CONTINUES</h3>
<p>Nations around the would condemned the US for the Iran Libya
Oil Sanctions Act, the new law penalizing firms that invest in
the energy sectors of Iran and Libya. The EU and other groups
denounced the measure as violation of world trade law, as it is
third party application of US law. The EU is preparing
retributive sanctions to counter the US ones.</p>
<p>The measure is designed to punish Iran and Libya for the
support of terrorism.</p>
<p>Iran denounced the measure as the act of a &quot;slave&quot;
of Israel. Direct trade between the US and both Iran and Libya is
already prohibited by law.</p>
<p>Turkey recently signed a $23 billion gas development deal with
Iran that may be subject to the sanctions. Under the 23 year
deal, a pipeline would be built to supply Turkey with oil. Turkey
claims the deal is not an investment in the energy sector,
instead a simple purchase, and therefore not subject to the
sanctions. However, the deal will not help the US-Turkish
relationship, already shaky.</p>
<p>France&#146;s Total SA has a $600 million deal with Iran to
develop offshore oil sources. Total SA would be sanctioned under
the act with possible penalties including: banning executives
from the US, limiting US investment in the firms, and banning the
company from all export transactions.</p>
<p>Most nations have a trading relationship with Iran, but not
Libya.</p>

<h2>SECURITY OF AIRFREIGHT CARGO</h2>
<p><strong>by Peter O&#146;Rorke</strong></p>
<p>The recent tragedy of TWA 800 has again thrown airline
security arrangements into the spotlight. The media attention has
focused on measures designed to check the luggage of passengers,
but of course cargo represents just as significant a threat. As
exporters, we share a duty to maintain the most stringent
security arrangements possible will all air shipments. This means
thought must be given to all aspects of your purchasing,
trucking, packing and international forwarding operations. In
many companies these functions are separate, so it is up to
managers and other executives to ensure that your company is
vigilant throughout all these departments.</p>
<p><strong>Freight Security Hints:</strong><br>
Become familiar with your US vendors. Learn about their
organization. Tell them that the goods you are purchasing from
them may be air freighted. If they are packing for export, make
sure they do this in a secure area.</p>
<p>Use reputable truckers who move the material quickly and
directly . Avoid leaving your shipments with others, in trucker
warehouses, etc.</p>
<p>Carefully inspect all material when received. If packed for
export, check for signs of tampering. If only a domestic pack, is
the packaging intact? When you repack for export or consolidate
with other items, ensure that this is done in a secure area to
with controlled access.</p>
<p>If you use a freight forwarder, ask them to prove to you that
your material is in secure storage until it is delivered to the
airline. Check them out! Drive out to their offices/warehouses
and see how long you can wander around without being challenged.</p>
<p>There has been effort by the FAA and airlines following the
TWA crash to tighten up security. This involves the use of
exporter signed certificates that must be delivered to the
airline with the cargo. Those are currently rather vague and most
of us in the industry believe that these forms will be replaced
with more detailed ones that show more information about the
shipment. More to the point, however, is to remember that a
signed form is no substitute for proper procedure, constantly
enforced, to ensure that the cargo you export does not contain
the makings of another disaster. </p>
<hr>
<h2>TREATIES AND AGREEMENTS</h2>
<h3>CWC: DEADLINE LOOMS</h3>
<p>The Senate must consider the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC)
by September 15, 1996, and it is likely to reach the floor soon
after the Summer recess ends September 3. The CWC is almost
universally supported -- by the Administration, the Joint Chiefs,
the Commerce Department and the Chemical Manufacturers
Association. Its few detractors include -- Sen. Jessie Helms
(R-SC) and the Heritage Foundation -- who claim the regulations
will unfairly impact small businesses.</p>
<p>If the CWC is ratified by 65 nations (60 have done so to date)
it will enter into force. Six months after the 65th nation
ratifies, the CWC will require companies to register with their
respective governments if they manufacture chemical weapons
agents or precursors. There is a three-tiered schedule of
compliance according to the strength and type of the chemical
agents. Companies must register and they may be subject to
international inspections. In the US, these regulations will be
administered by the Commerce Department.</p>
<p>Most experts predict the CWC will have little impact on US
businesses. In fact, it could actually help US commerce, by
forcing other nations to be more transparent with their own
chemical industries.</p>
<h3>CTBT NEGOTIATIONS FAIL</h3>
<p>After months of efforts negotiators could not come to an
agreement on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT). India
vetoed the current language on August 15 and ended any chance of
a treaty in the near future. India demanded that the five
declared nuclear powers China, France, Russia, US and UK agree to
a timetable for complete nuclear disarmament before it would
sign. None of the five agreed to this plan.</p>
<p>Because of India&#146;s opposition, the treaty cannot be
presented to the UN General Assembly by the UN Conference on
Disarmament as planned. However, Mexico, Brazil, Egypt, Peru and
Pakistan, in a group lead by Australia, are expected to present
the CTBT to the General Assembly as the &quot;Friends of the
CTBT.&quot; The treaty can pass the General Assembly with a
simple majority. However, current language makes it necessary for
all 44 states with nuclear reactors to agree to ratify the
treaty, thus India can prevent ratification. Iran also voiced
objections to the CTBT.</p>
<p>In fact, India may begin to more aggressively pursue its own
missile programs and reserves the right to build the bomb. A
large majority supports their nuclear programs. If the Indian
Government did accept the current CTBT language, it could lose
the next election because of this issue alone. In a country full
of divergent views, nuclear arms is one of the few issues
unifying different groups.</p>
<p>Treaties already in force ban the test of nuclear arms
everywhere except under ground. China was the last country to
test their nuclear forces, with an underground explosion this
summer. France received international criticism for their tests
in the South Pacific several month ago. India has not tested a
nuclear device since their sole explosion in 1974, but is widely
believed to have the capability of assembling a nuclear warhead
in a limited amount of time. Pakistan and Israel have not tested,
but are believed to have the technology.</p>
<p>Ironically, Jawaharlal Nehru, India&#146;s first Prime
Minister, first proposed the idea of a nuclear test ban in 1954.</p>
<hr>
<h2>VIOLATIONS</h2>
<h3>GERMANS SOLD CHEMICAL WEAPONS TO LIBYA</h3>
<p>German authorities arrested two businessmen for allegedly
selling chemical weapons equipment to Libya. According to
intelligence sources, the smuggling operation allowed the Libyans
to rebuild a major chemical plant.</p>
<p>The chemical weapons equipment in question would allow the
Libyans to mix poison gases in a full automated environment,
allowing sarin and soman poison gases to be mixed safely. The
equipment was purchased for $2.15 million from Siemens AG and
diverted through Belgium.</p>
<p>German Authorities only released the first names of the two --
Udo B. and Detlef C., and the full name of Berge Balanian, the
suspected middle man.</p>
<p>The Germans are being held in investigative custody while the
government investigates them and seeks Balanian, believed to be
in Libya. Opposition parties accused the Social Democrat
Government of having an ineffective export regime.</p>
<h3>NATO SEIZES MORE CROAT WEAPONS</h3>
<p>NATO seized a 106 mm rifle, anti-tank weapons, grenades, mines
and other equipment at a police station in Croat-controlled
territory. All weapons in the former Yugoslavia are supposed to
be kept in NATO-monitored storage facilities.</p>
<h3>DID YOU KNOW?????</h3>
<p>A few helpful hints for DTC cases:</p>
<p>Licensing Officers at DTC are returning without actions cases
because the backup data is not collated into sets. Remember, in
most cases 7 collated sets of technical data must be submitted.
When in doubt, always submit 7 collated sets, it is not worth
risking a RWA!</p>
<p>Be careful when referencing &quot;attachments.&quot; You
should only reference items like freight forwarder lists and
parts lists as attachments -- pages that will actually become
part of the license. Other technical data or contracts should not
be referenced as an attachment, because it will not be part of
the issued license. If a U.S. Customs officer notes a reference
to an attachment that is not part of the license, it may delay to
confusion and delay your shipment.</p>
<p>When applying for a spare parts license, it is not necessary
to attach a complete parts list. Lengthy lists only create more
work for you, State and Customs. State will stamp the approved
license with the &quot;no major components authorized&quot;
message to ensure only spare parts go out on the license. Customs
can track spares shipments by the dollar value alone.</p>
<p>DTC and DoD are examining licenses to send drawings in support
of a request for quotation with increased scrutiny. When
submitting this kind of case, be sure to explain exactly what the
drawings will be used for, and why this transaction does not give
manufacturing know-how or other technical assistance. The burden
is on the applicant to show the transaction does not require a
TAA or MLA.</p>
<hr>
<h2>INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS</h2>
<h3>CHINA-TAIWAN-US TENSION OVER MISSILE SALES</h3>
<p>he continuing saga of Sino-US-Taiwan triangle continued this
month over new Taiwanese purchases. Taiwan will buy $420 million
worth of US weapons including 1,299 Stinger missiles, launchers,
and .50 caliber ammunition. China immediately denounced the
proposed sale saying it would damage bilateral relations and
amounted to American instigation of Taiwan&#146;s separatism.
China considers Taiwan to be a rebel province.</p>
<p>The Foreign Ministry said the sale violated the 1982 agreement
to reduce arms sales to Taiwan. That agreement guides all US arms
transfers to Taiwan. No offensive arms are currently sold to
Taiwan and transfers of new equipment are scrutinized closely.</p>
<p>The Defense Department considers this sale to be a &quot;done
deal&quot; and the State Department supports it as consistent
with US foreign policy towards Taiwan and will not affect the
regional military balance. The sale will not require extensive US
training or assistance.</p>
<p>The sale of Avenger anti-aircraft missile systems to Taiwan
also angers China. The State Department approved that sale two
years ago. It is consistent with the US policy to sell only
defensive weapons to Taiwan. Deputy spokesman Glyn Davies said
there were no plans to reconsider the previous decision.</p>
<h3>CHINA TRANSFERRED MISSILE PRODUCTION TECHNOLOGY TO PAKISTAN</h3>
<p>Late in August the Washington Post revealed US intelligence
sources strongly suspect that China is transferring missile
manufacturing technology to Pakistan. The secret factory, capable
of manufacturing medium range M-11 type missiles, was built
outside the capital city of Islamabad with drawings and hardware
supplied by the government of China. The factory is still under
construction, but is suspected of having production capabilities
within two years. Some intelligence sources suspect Pakistan is
developing nuclear warheads for these missiles.</p>
<p>Vice President Al Gore confirmed (vaguely) the accuracy of the
Post&#146;s report by admitting the Administration is discussing
the issue with the Chinese.</p>
<p>The transfer of this technology is in direct violation of
China&#146;s pledge to adhere to the Missile Technology Control
Regime (MTCR) guidelines. China pledged not to transfer
MTCR-controlled know-how and material after the US imposed
sanctions related to a previous transfer to Pakistan.</p>
<p>Intelligence sources do not know if the factory will be
capable of producing complete missiles. Pakistan may need to
import guidance systems to make the M-11 clones function. </p>
<p>It is unclear what the US will do at this point. By law, the
Administration must impose sanctions if China violates its
pledge, but is the Administration willing or able to prove the
violations occurred? Sino-American relations have been
extraordinarily tense in the past year; conflicts over the US
visit of Taiwan&#146;s president, China&#146;s war-games,
intellectual property disputes, the suspected Chinese transfer of
ring magnets to Pakistan and human rights concerns have impacted
bilateral relations. Only recently, had the two countries begun
to patch up these sore spots.</p>
<p>In the unlikely event the Administration does impose the MTCR
sanctions, exports to China would be limited even further and
most imports from China would be banned for two years. Sanctions
would effect $39 billion worth of annual trade between the
nations. </p>
<p>So far Pakistan has denied the existence of the factory and
China has refused to comment.</p>
<h3>IRAN FILES TWO GERMAN SUITS</h3>
<p>Iran announced in late August it will sue German government
officials, and German powerhouse Siemens A.G. for their roles in
two unrelated matters.</p>
<p>The suit against the German officials seeks punitive damages
for the role Germany played in helping Iraq with its chemical
weapons programs. Iraqi chemical weapons were used against Iran
in the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war.</p>
<p>Iran is suing Siemens for $5.4 billion worth of damages
because the firm did not complete a nuclear power plant. Siemens
abandoned the project in 1979 after the Islamic revolution.
Siemens announced in 1992, it could not fulfill its end of the
contract because the German government would not let it export
critical parts to Iran. Russia signed an $800 million deal to
complete the Bushehr plant.</p>
<h3>UAE NARROWS AIRCRAFT CHOICE TO F-16 and RAFALE</h3>
<p>In the stiff competition to win the UAE&#146;s $6 billion
aircraft contract, only the F-16 and the Rafale remain alive. The
final decision will be announced in the next few months. The UAE
may also purchase a few more Mirage 2000s to complement its
existing fleet of 36 Mirages. Whatever planes are selected,
delivery will not be made until 2000.</p>
<h3>ISRAEL SEEKS FMS SURCHARGE WAIVER</h3>
<p>Israel asked the US to waive the 3 percent surcharge on all
FMS deals, a move which would give Israel an effective $35
million increase in annual aid. Currently all nations receiving <br>
FMS assistance must pay the surcharge to the Pentagon. Israel
seeks a waiver because the $1.8 billion annual assistance they
receive does not have the same purchasing power it did in the
1980s. The Pentagon has not commented, but a waiver is unlikely,
because it would require additional surcharges be placed on other
nations&#146; aid.</p>
<h3>EU TO REVIEW MISSILE JV</h3>
<p>The European Commission is investigating the proposed missile
joint venture between British Aerospace and Lagardere Groupe. The
consolidation of the two firms&#146; guided missile programs may
strengthen their already dominant position, and thus be
objectionable by the Commission. If the merger goes forward, it
will create the largest guided weapons business in Europe.
Analysts see the merger as a key step in the consolidation of the
European defense industry.</p>
<h3>ASIA TURNS TO SUBS</h3>
<p>In recent months Taiwan, Thailand, Malaysia, South Korea and
North Korea have all made moves to upgrade or acquire submarines.
Defense analysts point to a perceived threat from China as the
explanation for the renewed interest in the underwater arena.
According to Defense News, Japan in particular has monitored
China&#146;s sub activities with interest. However, budgets are
limited and most Asian nations are looking at long-term
acquisition strategies and diesel equipment to save cash.</p>
<h3>AFGHANISTAN APPEALS FOR ARMS</h3>
<p>President Burhanuddin Rabbini of Afghanistan appealed to the
UN not to impose an arms embargo on his nation, because rebels
will still be able to get shipments. The proposed embargo,
designed to keep rebel factions from getting weapons, will be
debated b the UN General Assembly this month. The US added
Afghanistan to its list of proscribed destinations (22 CFR 126.1)
last month, and is asking the Wassenaar Arrangement countries to
consider adding Afghanistan and the Sudan to its list of
proscribed countries.</p>
<h3>UKRAINE SELLS TANKS TO PAKISTAN</h3>
<p>Ukraine recently sold 300 T-80UD tanks worth $550 million to
Pakistan. The Ukraine has increasingly turned to South Asia for
sales -- recently closing deals with India for military trucks
and with Sri Lanka for military transport planes. Since the
collapse of the Soviet Union the Ukraine lost most of its defense
sales.</p>
<h3>MALAYSIAN OFFICERS</h3>
<p>An opposition leader accused the defense ministry of
purchasing sub-standard equipment from ex-officers this month.
The government demanded the names of these officers to pursue the
allegations. The equipment in questions may be obsolete and
effect the readiness of the Malaysian Air Force. Malaysia has
spent $4.4 billion on defense in the past five years.</p>
<h3>POLAND TO RECONSIDER BOSNIAN TANK DEAL</h3>
<p>According to Prime Minister Cimoszewicz, Poland will consider
carefully the US proposal to supply Polish tanks to Bosnia. Under
the US proposal, NATO funds would be used to buy $50 million
worth of T-72 tanks for the Bosnian army. Poland&#146;s caution
stems from concerns over regional stability.</p>
<h3>BUSINESS NEWS</h3>
<p>Austria ordered sights and stands for a new anti-tank missile
system from Bofors of Sweden. The $20.5 million deal will be
completed in 1998.</p>
<p>DynCorp was awarded a key subcontract from Battelle Memorial
Institute to provide support to the Army&#146;s preparations for
the implementation of the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC).</p>
<p>British Aerospace won a tech-transfer contract from the Saudis
to maintain their Tornado warplanes. Major offsets are involved
in the contract. The total value of the deal has not been
released as of yet.</p>
<h3>HUMAN RIGHTS GROUPS CALL FOR INDONESIAN ARMS BAN</h3>
<p>The Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Center for Human Rights and
Human Rights Watch-Asia called for a ban on munitions trade with
Indonesia and the end to all state visits to the island nation.
Indonesia recently cracked down on all political opposition and
rioting disrupted the capital. The US State Department already
bans all small weapons and crowd-control equipment to Indonesia.</p>
<h3>TURKEY AND POLAND BUY HELICOPTERS</h3>
<p>Turkey announced plans to spend $3 billion on 145 new attack
helicopters over the next ten years. The government is accepting
bids and will look at the offset package in particular when
evaluating proposals. Helicopters under consideration include the
UHU-HAS Tiger, the A-129 Mangusta, the Mi-28, the AH-64 Apache,
the AH-1W Super Cobra and the RAH-66 Comanche.</p>
<p>Poland will soon announce who won its Huzar combat helicopter
upgrade. The Elbit-Rafael team is expected to win the deal.
Proposals from Israel Aircraft Industries, Lod, Euromissile S.A.
and Rockwell are also under consideration. The deal will also
include offsets.</p>
<h3>IRAQ STILL CIRCUMVENTING UN</h3>
<p>UN Inspector Rolf Ekeus reported to the UN Security Council
that Iraq continues to violate its promise to allow inspections
of weapons facilities. Iraq repeatedly denied UN inspectors
access to files and facilities, and even loaded some weapons on
trucks and trains to circumvent inspections. The UN maintains a
strict embargo against Iraq and will continue to do so until UN
inspectors are satisfied that Iraq has eliminated its chemical
and biological weapons and missile programs.</p>
<h3>US ANGERS THAILAND OVER MISSILE SALE</h3>
<p>The Clinton Administration rejected a request from Thailand to
allow the sale of AIM-120 Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air
missiles. Thailand wanted the missiles to equip their new F/18s.
However, the Administration was not persuaded by Thailand&#146;s
reasons for the sale, and the US has a position not to introduce
new weapons technology into a region. If Malaysia buys Russian
AA-12 &quot;Adder&quot; missiles, the US will reconsider the
AIM-120 question.</p>
<h3>RUSSIA WILL HELP IRAN BUILD SATELLITE</h3>
<p>Russia agreed to help Iran build and launch its first
satellite in the next three years. Russia is Iran&#146;s largest
arms supplier and helped Iran build its first nuclear power
plant. The purpose of the satellite has not been released.</p>
<h3>RUSSIAN FIRMS SAYS NO TAIWAN SALE</h3>
<p>Taiwan announced this month they wanted to buy Russian
helicopters, but arms exporter Rosvooruzheniye, denies any deal.
Taiwan is interested in Russian helicopters because they are
cheap and did not expect Russia to turn away a potential sale.
Russia has not ruled out the sale, but said they will be very
cautious because of the effect on PRC relations. The PRC is
Russia&#146;s largest arms customer and their huge orders helped
Russia reclaim the top world sales title for 1995.</p>

<h2 align="left">Executive Notes</h2>
<p><strong>INTRODUCING STRATEGIC/CSL</strong><br>
We are proud to announce a joint venture between CSL and
Strategic Shipping Company, a freight forwarder based in the UK
with offices in California, North Carolina and Virginia.
Strategic is a topnotch freight forwarding company with extensive
experience in defense transactions. Peter O'Rorke, the President
of Strategic, will be in the US for several weeks this summer, so
if you have any questions about Strategic, call our office and we
will put you in touch with Peter.</p>
<p><strong>SEMINAR INQUIRES</strong><br>
We have received many questions about the CSL Seminar held
annually in South Carolina. We are planning to hold the seminar
this year, probably in late October, but have not settled all the
details. We hope to finalize the arrangements in the next few
weeks.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>UN EMBARGO ENDS</strong><br>
The UN Embargo against former Yugoslavia expired June 18. The
five-year ban officially ended five months after the Dayton peace
treaty was signed.</p>
<p><strong>RUSSIA REMOVED FROM PROSCRIBED LIST</strong><br>
Russia is no longer a proscribed destination for Munitions List
export and import transactions. However, an agreement between the
U.S. and Russia does limit the kinds of firearms permitted to be
imported into the U.S. from Russia. Please contact our office for
the complete listing.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>SED ERRORS</strong><br>
Census and Customs expressed concern that 50% of paper Shipper
Export Declarations (SED) are being filled out improperly. Both
agencies blame late filing of complete and accurate SEDs for the
problem. If voluntary compliance does not solve the issue,
shipments may be delayed or detained because of incomplete SEDs.</p>
<p><strong>SATELLITE PROBLEMS</strong><br>
Warning! If you have a Commerce license for a satellite to be
launched in another country, you may not discuss detailed launch
vehicle data without a State Department license for technical
data. Several companies have gotten in trouble because of this
important distinction. The U.S. Government is considering
requiring ITAR tech data licenses for all foreign launches to
cover just that situation.</p>
<hr>
<h2>U.S. Government</h2>
<h3>UNDER SECRETARY FOR ARMS CONTROL GRILLED BY HOUSE COMMITTEE</h3>
<p>The Under-Secretary of State for Arms Control and
International Security Affairs, Lynn Davis, was questioned by the
House International Relations committee over the administrations
handling of global arms proliferation, especially coming from
China. Davis, and Democrat members of the committee, pointed out
several of the administration's accomplishments, including the
denuclearization of the CIS (excluding Russia) and China's
commitment to not sell missiles which are proscribed under the
MTCR. Under pressure from the US, Russia agreed to halt arms
sales to Iran, a provision which became part of the Wassennaar
agreement. Davis stated that Chinese arms sales are a current and
future threat. According to the Under-Secretary, the State
Department is trying to convince China to follow Russia and agree
not to sell arms to Iran.</p>
<p>Republican representatives used the hearing as an opportunity
both to criticize Clinton and to level accusations against China.
Representative Chris Smith (R-NJ) and Benjamin Gilman (R-NY)
offered &quot;do and don't&quot; lists for combating
proliferation, including being the need to levy sanctions when
they are threatened and ignore empty promises offered by
proliferators. Smith, at the hearing, railed against Chinese
human rights violations for ten minutes, finally asking &quot;. .
. Why would any reasonable person believe the Chinese?!&quot;
Davis responded to numerous questions of this sort by replying
that the Chinese had lived up to commitments to not sell MTCR
class missiles.</p>
<h3>NASA AND EXPORT LICENSING</h3>
<p>NASA is a rather unique government agency from the licensing
perspective as it both reviews license applications, and applies
for its own. Bob Tucker and Julia Kortum handle all licenses at
NASA. This year to date they have received and reviewed about 120
ITAR cases. They try to complete all reviews within 20 working
days, but that has proven to be difficult since they also receive
CCL and FAA cases. Most of the time NASA recommends approval with
provisos for ITAR cases. In addition, NASA participates in the
Missile Technology Export Control Regime (MTEC) and MTAG
(Military Technology Advisory Group).</p>
<p>According to NASA, you can speed up the review process by
informing them in advance that a case is on the way -- by phone
or by providing an advance copy. In addition, if you plan a
meeting with DTSA or DTC regarding your case, NASA would like to
know so they can participate in the briefing as well.</p>
<p>As an exporter, NASA strictly follows the regulations set
forth in the EAR and the ITAR. They even have their own
compliance program!</p>
<h3>HOUSE APPROVES NEW 'BUY AMERICA' PROVISIONS</h3>
<p>On June 13 the House passed the Hoke amendment, a measure
which will force the Pentagon to buy only American-made landing
gear. The bill was in response to the fall of US share in landing
gear from 86 percent in 1992 to 24 percent this year. Other
products protected by similar measures include anchor chains,
gyrocompasses and some ship propellers.</p>
<p>Whether or not the amendment will become a part of the Defense
Authorization bill, depends on the upcoming conference. NATO
allies are watching this provision in particular as a bellwether
to measure America's willingness to open its own defense market.
Currently the US exports goods worth more than four times that of
what it imports from Europe.</p>
<h3>HOUSE APPROVES SANCTIONS FOR IRAN/LIBYA INVESTORS</h3>
<p>Despite opposition from U.S. trading partners, the House
approved a bill which would require the President to impose two
of six sanctions on any foreign company investing $40 million or
more in Iranian or Libyan oil and gas. The bill was designed to
penalize European companies who continue to trade with those
rogue nations despite hostility and support of terrorist
activities.</p>
<p>The President supports the bill, and with a similar Senate
measure already passed, it seems likely to be enacted. Europe and
Canada are expected to protest at the G-7 meeting this summer.
Allies object to the Iranian portion of the proposed sanction
only, since most already have sanctions in place against Libya.
Iran has verbally assaulted the U.S. for the measure.</p>
<h3>INTERNATIONAL CRITICISM OF US PARIAH POLICY</h3>
<p>The European Union, highly critical of US initiatives such as
the Helms-Burton Act (enacted) and the Iran Oil Sanctions Act
(now in conference) decided to mute its criticism of
controversial US trade policies. Still, the EU will ask the World
Trade Organization (WTO) to issue a consultative decision on the
international legality of Helms-Burton. They complain the Act
results in discrimination in US markets against firms that trade
with Cuba, and the US is overstepping its jurisdiction by
attempting to regulate the behavior of foreign firms. The
European Union also will likely ask the WTO to review the Iran
Oil Sanctions Act (see related story).</p>
<p>Canada and Mexico, however, will not be silent on the issue of
Helms-Burton. Both have significant trade ties with Cuba. The
Organization of American States (OSA) passed a resolution
condemning the Helms-Burton legislation. The Mexicans also
threatened to slap punitive duties on US exports entering their
country, although the possibility of this happening under the
framework of NAFTA is uncertain and, one would think, unlikely,
given the economic reliance of Mexico on the US. Canada, which
allows its firms to ignore US court rulings in any case, will
allow its companies to sue American firms involved in
Helms-Burton cases. Despite all this, the administration plans to
implement the provisions of Helms-Burton, a politically popular
bill.</p>
<h3>ENCRYPTION UPDATE</h3>
<p>This month there was another congressional hearing relating to
the Internet and encryption controls and S. 1726 &quot;Promotion
of Commerce On-Line in the Digital Era (Pro-Code) Act of
1996.&quot; Pro-Code is co-sponsored by Senator Conrad Burns
(R-MT) and would relax control on software with more than 40-bit
encryption. The bill is supported by industry.</p>
<p>According to the Information Technology Association of America
(ITAA), current encryption policy would cost 200,000 jobs and $60
billion over the next four years, if continued.</p>
<p>In a related development, Microsoft discretely hired a
lobbyist to support its Washington interests. According to the
Congressional Monitor, the encryption issue is on the lobbyist's
top agenda.</p>
<h3>CTBT CLOSE TO SUCCESS AND FAILURE</h3>
<p>Negotiators for the eight countries confirmed or thought to
possess nuclear technology have been close to closing the
Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) all month, but never
able to finalize the treaty. Success seemed impossible last week
as India announced they would not sign the treaty three days
before talks were scheduled to be completed. The US then turned
to Pakistan to ask them to support the treaty despite India's
position but Pakistan did not agree to this concession.</p>
<p>On the day of the deadline, Friday, the chairman of the
negotiations presented all eight countries with a final draft of
the CTBT with several unresolved provisions. France was the only
country to announce it would accept the treaty. Instead of a
final agreement, governments will vote in late July whether the
treaty should go before the General Assembly of the UN. The eight
nations would have to come to an agreement by July 29 in order to
make the treaty's progress feasible.</p>
<p>When the US changed its position in the middle of the CTBT
talks, all five declared nuclear powers, US, UK, France, Russia
and China agreed that the three 'undeclared' powers, India,
Pakistan and Israel had to sign as well for the treaty to be
meaningful. Previously, the US hoped the pressure of the treaty
would force the undeclared powers to adhere to its provisions.
The US agreed in exchange for tougher inspection standards.</p>
<p>However India has used this agreement, to force its own
agenda-- insisting the treaty also required the destruction of
existing nuclear weapons within a negotiated time period. India
called the treaty without such a provision a &quot;charade.&quot;
That provision is unacceptable to the other parties. Some say
Britain, Russia and China are hiding behind India's reluctance
and truly do not want the CTBT to come into force.</p>
<p>As the June 28 deadline rapidly approached, countries worked
to reach some sort of compromise. The negotiators discussed an
US-supported position to let the treaty take effect with the
ratification of 75 nations, but Britain and Russia rejected the
idea. </p>
<p>China even agreed to give up so-called 'peaceful' tests that
they wanted to remain exempt, as long as the other parties agreed
to reexamine the treaty in ten years.</p>
<p>If the issues among the eight principal countries can be
resolved before the July 29 meeting of the Conference on
Disarmament, the CTBT could still progress as originally
scheduled. Such an agreement seems unlikely at this point.</p>
<h3>NATO EXPANSION MAY BECOME CAMPAIGN ISSUE</h3>
<p>In a June 25 speech, Bob Dole stressed the need for a firm
timetable for NATO expansion in the next two years. He also said
that Russia must not be allowed to intimidate its neighbors or
prevent NATO expansion. While Clinton supports the inclusion of
Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic in NATO, he has downplayed
the issue because of the Russian elections.</p>
<p>NATO Secretary General Javier Solana responded that NATO is
scheduled to decide on new members in 1997 and there was no need
to speed up the timetable.</p>
<p>Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic are the top candidates
for early NATO expansion. Last week the President of the Ukraine
met with Polish officials to discuss the Polish bid for NATO
membership and other regional issues.</p>
<h3>VIOLATION</h3>
<p>Rotchco, a New York firm exporting surplus military and police
department equipment, has been charged with illegally exporting
defense-related articles. These items included night vision
equipment, hand grenades, and chemical protective suits. Sales
were to a number of foreign companies, including one linked to
the Japanese cult involved in Tokyo's subway gassings.</p>
<h3>DID YOU KNOW?????</h3>
<p>Did you know the new license exceptions under the Commerce
Regulations replace general licenses under the old regulations?
All exceptions are listed in section 740 of the EAR. Here is a
list of the new license exceptions and a brief description of
what they cover:</p>
<p>1. LVS - Limited Value Shipment: maximum value for this

&quot;GBS-Yes&quot; to Group B countries:<br>
3. CIV -- Civil End-User: If listed on CCL with &quot;CIV

tiers are listed in Section 740.3(e)(2-4).<br>
6. TEMP -- Temporary Exports and Reexports: export and reexport
commodities and software for temporary use abroad if the item(s)
return to the US as soon as practicable, no later than 1 year

is:<br>
a. Tool of the trade -- for use by an employee of the exporter
while abroad (for service or commission, etc.). Not eligible for
country group D:1.<br>
b. Kits of replacement parts -- if would qualify for one-to-one
replacement exception, the kit remains in the control of the
exporter and all parts are returned except for one-to-one
replacements.<br>
c. Exhibition and Demonstration for country group B: as long as
exporter retains ownership and the exporter or his designate
retains control of the item(s) while abroad. The items may only
be used to the minimum level needed for demonstration purposes.
The commodities may not be exhibited at one site for more than
120 days.<br>
d. Commodities to be inspected, repaired, calibrated or tested
abroad.<br>
e. Containers, if no other exception is available.<br>
f. Broadcast material.<br>
g. Blank video tape for use abroad.<br>
h. Items for assembly or processing in Mexico to be returned to
the US.<br>
i. All commodities necessary for news-gathering that accompany
news personnel abroad, for countries in groups D:1 or E:2 if they
remain in the possession of the media personnel while abroad.
Must send a packing list of the exported goods to BXA with an
estimate of the time abroad, may be checked by OEE. For all other
destinations, may go under Tools of the trade.<br>
7. TUS -- Temporarily in the US: foreign-origin items temporarily
in the US (in transit, for display at a trade show, returned
because unwanted, returned because refused entry) See section
740.4(b) for restrictions and conditions.<br>
8. BETA -- Beta test software: exports to all countries except
E:2 as long as software will be marketed to the general public,
it is provided free-of-charge or at a price less than
reproduction and distribution, it does not require tech support
for installation and the exporter has a statement from the
importer with the language in 740.4(c)(5); software must be
returned within 30 days of the end of the Beta test period.<br>
9. PTS -- Parts for one-to-one replacement. See 740.5(a) for

<h2>INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS</h2>
<h3>EGYPT DENIES PURCHASES FROM NORTH KOREA</h3>
<p>Last week Egypt denied reports it purchased missile parts and
launchers from North Korea. The materials in question would
enable Egypt to make its own short-range missiles. </p>
<p>According to the Egyptian government, the reports are just
attempts to separate the US and Egypt. The State Department is
still investigating the reports, which if proven, would put Egypt
in an awkward position as the recipient of over one billion a
year in US military aid.</p>
<h3>EUROPE EXPECTED TO GAIN GROUND IN ASIAN MARKETS</h3>
<p>According to Defense News, European defense companies are
expected in increase sales to East Asia and take market share
away from US suppliers. East Asian nations are turning away from
US companies for two reasons: export controls, and the
unavailability of sought after equipment (like diesel
submarines). In addition, the aggressive sales tactics of
European companies are helping them to close more deals.<br>
The US now holds a 49 percent market share in comparison to
Europe's 10 percent, however that could change quickly. And the
East Asian market is one of the healthiest -- defense budgets
have grown 23 percent in the last ten years.</p>
<p>With export controls causing delays and preventing the
transfer of some high-tech equipment, East Asian countries are
looking elsewhere. European competitors are more than willing to
step into the gap.</p>
<h3>CHINA AND PAKISTAN: WHAT NOW ?!?</h3>
<p>This timeit appears Pakistan may have assembled M-11 missiles
shipped to them by the Chinese three years ago. The M-11 can
deliver a nuclear warhead, and Pakistan is considered one of
three &quot;threshold,&quot; or &quot;undeclared,&quot; nuclear
states (along with Israel and India).</p>
<p>US law calls for sanctions to be imposed on China over the
affair. The State Department said that sanctions will be imposed
if it is proven the missiles were deployed. Despite numerous
reasons to impose sanctions like intellectual property issues and
previous technology exports to Pakistan, the US has been
reluctant to impose sanctions on China.</p>
<p>It is even alleged the US government might have altered
intelligence reports to play down the possibility of the missiles
being deployed; the State Department, however, denies any
alterations.</p>
<p>Senator Pressler has asked for a delay in shipments of already
paid for military materiel to Pakistan pending a resolution of
this controversy.</p>
<h3>CONVERSATION WITH OFFICIAL FROM INDIAN EMBASSY</h3>
<p>While at the Lynn Davis hearing, CSL had a chance to converse
with a member of the Indian embassy staff. He expressed concerns
over US efforts to limit arms sales through sanctions and
international regimes, saying that the average Indian was
suspicious of US motivations and angry that the US would deny
others weapons it itself owns. This could become significant
because political power in India is shifting to more populist
leaders. Indeed, he believed that the nationalistic BJP party -
which claims it will hold nuclear tests should it attain (and
hold) power - would win easily if elections were held today.</p>
<h3>FRANCE RECONSIDERS DEFENSE BUDGET CUTS</h3>
<p>Under German pressure, France agreed to reverse its spending
plans and restore funding to joint Franco-German programs. This
announcement of cuts last month took the Germans by surprise. The
German government was angered by this plan, as it represented a
reversal of close Franco-German defense planning. A drop in
French procurement, furthermore, would have entailed greater per
unit costs for the Germans.</p>
<p>It is no surprise that the funds allocated for the joint
programs will come from planned imports from the United States
and other third party countries. Purchases of the E-2C Hawkeye,
for instance, are being reduced. The French budget also calls for
cuts in French-only systems such as the Rafale fighter and
LeClerc tank. This last group of cuts angered French legislators,
although the defense budget easily passed in the National
Assembly. Defense cuts are expected to cost the French defense
industry approximately 60,000 jobs, out of 300,000 currently, by
2002.</p>
<h3>ISRAEL STEPS INTO TRADE GAP WITH TURKEY</h3>
<p>Israel and Turkey are developing a military partnership and
attracting world attention. An agreement signed in February
allows for Israeli pilots to train in Turkey. Israel and Turkey
also foresee future joint naval exercises.</p>
<p>Turkey will likely purchase military equipment and contracting
services from the Israeli defense industry. A $600 million deal
has almost been concluded for Israel to upgrade Turkish F-4
fighters. Israel is also competing for contracts to outfit the
Turkish army with assault rifles and refueling aircraft. Turkey
is developing alternate supply sources than the United States,
due to US restrictions on arms exports to Turkey. </p>
<p>Turkey has been criticized by other mostly-Muslim states and
its own Islamic fundamentalists for its growing ties to Israel.
The Turkish government, for its part, feels threatened by hostile
neighbors on the one hand and disapproving allies on the other.
Israel is in some a natural ally against common foes such as
Syria, Iran, and Iraq. The election of Netanyahu in Israel may
result in closer ties between Jerusalem and Ankara. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, Iran announced its willingness to sign a treaty
with Syria to counterbalance the Turko-Israeli agreement. There
has been some amount of tension between Syria and Turkey in
recent years. Turkey accuses Syria of supporting PKK rebels, and
Syria demands greater water rights from the Euphrates. Recent
reports indicate, but Turkey denies, a buildup of Turkish troops
on the Syrian border.</p>
<p>The budding Turko-Israeli relationship is threatened by the
possibility of the Islamic Welfare Party coming to power in
Turkey. The Welfare Party is opposed to the close ties with the
West and extremely critical of the growing relationship between
Turkey and Israel. Welfare Party officials said that if it should
form the next Turkish government, the deals with Israel would be
terminated. Turkish president Demirel asked the Welfare Party to
try and form a parliamentary majority following the collapse of a
more moderate government in early June.</p>
<p>The Turkish campaign against Kurdish separatists continued in
June. Turkey claimed to have killed over 225 guerillas in one
five-day period. These skirmishes with the PKK may mean more
scrutiny of military exports to Turkey in the future.</p>
<p>Israel, to quell Greek anxieties about the Turko-Israeli
agreements, agreed to a framework for military cooperation
similar to that it has with Turkey. Current plans, which have yet
to be cemented, only include joint naval exercises. </p>
<h3>UKRAINIAN ARMS INDUSTRY REBOUNDS</h3>
<p>After years of decline, the Ukrainian arms industry's
production rose 3 percent to just over $200 million. In the four
previous years, the industry had seen its defense industry
workforce cut to one-fifth its level at the collapse of the
Union. Much of this was the result of extensive defense
conversion. The Ukraine plans extensive cooperation with the
Russian defense industry. They also intend to aggressively pursue
export markets as a way to keep its arms industry alive. This
aggression has created some international suspicion -- the US
State Department is investigating a transfer of Ukrainian weapons
technology to Libya, a violation of international sanctions.</p>
<h3>BRITISH FACE DISCRIMINATION FROM UAE</h3>
<p>According to the British Embassy, an official from the UAE
recently hinted that British bids for large commercial deals do
not receive equal consideration because of the lack of a defense
pact between the two countries. The proposed pact has been on the
table for over two years, but the two nations have not been able
to finalize the details.</p>
<p>The UAE wants Britain to commit to extensive support in the
event their security is threatened. The UAE does have defense
pacts with the U.S. and France, and those countries have won $4.3
billion worth of defense orders in the past three years.
According to Reuters, France has pledged up to 70,000 troops, 120
jet fighters and 200 helicopters if the UAE is attacked.</p>
<p>British defense firms are urging the government to complete
the defense pact soon, in particular before a $6 billion warplane
contract is awarded this year. France is aggressively pursuing
the contract, with a visit by the Foreign Minister just this
month to discuss their proposal. Officially British, U.S. and
French companies are competing for the deal, but sources indicate
there are no British firms on the UAE short list.</p>
<h3>HOME FOUND FOR PAKISTANI F-16s</h3>
<p>After years of debate over the fate of the F-16s purchased
long ago by Pakistan, there appears to be a concrete plan to sell
them to Indonesia. Indonesia will likely receive the planes in at
least two purchases, the first containing eleven aircraft.
Pakistan, which still technically owns the aircraft, agreed to
the sale so long as it receives the proceeds and the US makes up
the difference between the current and 1985 value of the planes.
This amount is expected to be around $150 million.</p>
<p>The Indonesia F-16 deal does not represent a change in US
policy towards that country. US firms are still prohibited from
selling Indonesia any equipment, such as small arms or riot gear,
usable against the population of East Timor. The F-16, a piece of
major defense equipment, does not fall into this category. This
policy is similar to a British one allowing the sale of Hawk
anti-aircraft missiles to Indonesia. There have been reports
these missiles were used against ground targets in East Timor,
and the UK has been criticized for the sale.</p>
<h3>EVENTS IN THE BALKANS</h3>
<p>An accord was reached between the Muslim-Croat Federation, the
Bosnian Serbs, Croatia, and Yugoslavia on arms controls for the
region. Under the terms of the agreement, the Bosnian Serbs will
decrease their stock of tracked combat vehicles, and the Bosnian
government will increase theirs. The goal is to achieve a rough
balance between the Bosnian combatants and their neighboring
supporters. The Bosnian Muslims and Croats still cannot reach an
agreement on combining their armed forces, a failure of
negotiations which is holding up the delivery of millions of
dollars in US equipment to the two erstwhile allies.</p>
<p>Last month, Bosnian Serbs were removed from the list of
specially designated nationals. Earlier this year sanctions
against Serbia and Montenegro were suspended and Bosnia and
Herzegovina were declare eligible for defense exports. The
Administration supports trade with former Yugoslavia in
principle, but is likely to be cautious about trade. Wrangling
over an election in Bosnia, the status of human and minority
rights in Serb controlled territory, and the fate of Serbian war
criminals could all serve to limit or prevent exports to the
Bosnian Serbs for a considerable length of time.</p>
<h3>AEGEAN CREATES TENSION BETWEEN GREECE AND TURKEY</h3>
<p>A series of war games in the Aegean, a fight over an
uninhabited island and a dozen complaints about territorial water
violations escalated tensions between Greece and Turkey. On June
16 Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis warned Turkey they would
actively defend any attack on any of their islands in the Aegean.</p>
<p>Greece appealed to the US and Russia for support, warning the
Turkish threats could destabilize the region. The US moderated
one of the disputes between Greece and Turkey. So far the Clinton
Administration has not taken sides, and responded coolly to the
Greek position.</p>
<p>Partially in response to the tensions, Greece plans to
purchase $10 billion worth of arms in the next five years. Their
acquisition list includes F-16 fighters, helicopter, missiles and
submarines. Greece currently spends 4.6% of their GDP on defense.</p>
<h3>ARMSCOR APPLAUDS U.S. EMBARGO</h3>
<p>Armscor, South Africa's state weapons agency said they have
benefitted from a U.S. embargo. Armscor General Manager, Eric
Esterhuyse revealed several countries, seeking to remain outside
the U.S. sphere of influence have purchased from Armscor because
of the embargo.</p>
<p>Armscor remains embargoed because of a deal made during the
apartheid era in violation of U.S. sanctions at that time. </p>
<h3>HIZBOLLAH SENDS IRAQI ARMS TO BAHRAIN</h3>
<p>The Kuwaiti Hizbollah sent weapons left over from Iraqi troops
to their counterpart in Bahrain. The Bahraini group was recently
accused by the government of Bahrain of plotting to overthrow the
government of the Emir.</p>
<p>Kuwaiti militants are suspected of hoarding the arms left
after Iraq retreated in 1991 and the government of Kuwait has
been trying to confiscate. Bahrain arrested five individuals for
smuggling arms from Kuwait in early June.</p>
<h3>BOTSWANA'S ACQUISITIONS RAISE CONCERNS</h3>
<p>Botswana signed a contact last month for 13 CF-5 fighter
bombers from Canada, and negotiated another deal with the
Netherlands for 50 German Leopold tanks -- in total over $100
million purchase for the African nation. The acquisitions are
raising eyebrows from several sources.</p>
<p>The German government may try to block the export according to
their reexport regulations. Apparently several unnamed
governments have put pressure on Bonn to stop the deal. </p>
<p>In addition, Namibia has protested the build up and is
currently involved in a minor border dispute with Botswana. Other
neighbors, including Zimbabwe have no opposition.</p>
<p>Most of all, policy analysts and regional experts are puzzled
by the move. As Reuters put it, &quot;Botswana -- landlocked,
peaceful, unthreatened and prosperous&quot; should have no reason
for a major buildup. The government of Botswana said they planned
to use the equipment for border patrols and anti-poaching
activities.</p>
<hr>
<h3>INTERNATIONAL SHORTS</h3>
<p><strong>FOR ONCE, ARMS TECHNOLOGY TRANSFERS INTO CHINA</strong><br>
Technology transfers from Israel to China were the subject of a
meeting between State Department and Israeli officials reported
in the Washington Times. The Israelis are suspected of
transferring US aircraft technology to the Chinese in 1992. The
Washington Times claimed a leaked CIA report was its source . The
transferred technology would be installed into the Chinese F-10
fighter, expected to be deployable in ten years. Technology from
the Patriot SAM is also suspected of having been transferred to
China from Israel.</p>
<p><strong>BRITISH MOD WILL AWARD BILLIONS WORTH OF CONTRACTS</strong><br>
The British MOD is close to finalizing several procurement deals
worth several billion pounds. The MOD hopes to conclude its
purchases before the upcoming election. Major acquisitions are
expected in advanced missiles for the RAF and naval programs.</p>
<p><strong>AEROSPATIALE AND DASSAULT MERGER WILL BE FINALIZED
SOON</strong><br>
The two aerospace giants of France, Aerospatiale and Dassault,
are close to finalizing the state-encouraged merger between the
two. Serge Dassault, who owned 49.9 percent of Dassault will
receive a 27 percent interest in the new company, short of the 33
percent necessary for veto power. When merged,
Aerospatiale-Dassault's total value will be more than $6 billion.</p>
<p><strong>RUSSIAN CHANGES MAY EFFECT EXPORTS</strong><br>
The recent personnel changes inside Boris Yeltsin's government
may effect Russia's export policy and volume according to Defense
News. Oleg Soskovets, first deputy prime minister, was recently
fired in a shake-up that included the appointment of Lt. Gen
Alexander Lebed as national security adviser and Russian Security
Council secretary. Soskovets was actively involved in many of
Russia's arms export deals including some controversial ones with
Iran and South Africa. At this point it is too soon to say how
the changes, and the election will effect Russia's policy. </p>
<p><strong>RISKS CHANGE UNDER &quot;NEW WORLD ORDER&quot;</strong><br>
According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute
(SIPRI), the danger of global nuclear destruction has diminished,
but the threat of proliferation of chemical, biological and
nuclear weapons has increased. Their research also indicates the
U.S. lead world arms sales with 43% of transacting; Russia's
total rose to 17%. SIPRI's 1996 Yearbook is published by Oxford
University Press; a brief summary of the report is available at
http://www.sipri.se/pubs/yb96/.</p>
<p><strong>EUROPE'S DEFENSE INDUSTRY MUST CONSOLIDATE TO COMPETE</strong><br>
At a recent seminar of the European defense industry's top
professionals agreed -- European companies have to change the way
they do business now to compete with their American counterparts.
However, individual countries disagree on how to make their
future a success -- the French are actively consolidating and
seeking preferences, while the British have a more free market
approach. Under the EU, individual countries have control over
their own arms industries, so wide-scale EU cooperation is not
likely in the near future.</p>
<p><strong>WORLD DISARMAMENT WILL COST BILLIONS</strong><br>
According to the Bonn International Centre for Conversion (BICC)
the cost of disposing of surplus weapons may reach between $90
and 4185 billion in the next 10 to 20 years. BICC reports the
danger of poor states such as the former communist satellites to
improperly store or export the unneeded items. They recommend
establishing an international disarmament fund.</p>
<p><strong>EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT SAYS NO TO INDONESIAN ARMS DEALS</strong><br>
The European Parliament urged all its members to stop selling
munitions to Indonesia because of that country's record on human
rights, in particular its treatment of annexed East Timor. Seven
of the eight member parties supported the non-binding resolution.</p>
<p><strong>FRENCH DEFENSE EXPORTS INCREASE IN 1995</strong><br>
Largely because of orders from the Middle East, French defense
exports rose to $ 6.7 billion from $6.34 billion in 1994. 69.3
percent of the total was from naval sales, with two frigates sold
to Saudi Arabia for a total of $3.6 billion.</p>
<p><strong>TAIWAN SHOULD GET STINGER MISSILE PACKAGE</strong><br>
According to Defense News, the Pentagon is expected to notify
Congress of its intent to transfer Stinger missile systems to
Taiwan. The $200 million-deal is not likely to face opposition
from the Hill. This transfer introduces a new technology into the
region and encourage other Asian countries to request the
technology. China is expected to protest the deal which some
experts consider a direct result of China's activities in March
in the Taiwan Strait.</p>
<p><strong>IRAQ GIVES UN WEAPONS RECORDS</strong><br>
Iraq gave UN arms inspector Rolf Ekes &quot;all&quot; of its
files on chemical, biological and surface-to-surface missiles
last week. The UN sought these files since the end of the Persian
Gulf War. In addition, Iraq agreed to let UN inspectors
unrestricted access to any site they want to see. This change in
Iraqi policy seems to indicate a willingness to cooperate with
the terms of the 1991 treaty that ended the conflict in order to
have the trade embargo lifted. Recently Iraq negotiated a
one-time oil for food trade deal with the UN. Ekes holds Iraq is
still concealing several important reports on chemical,
biological and nuclear weapons.</p>
<p><strong>CHINA CHARGES US IMPORTER </strong><br>
China charged William P. Chen, a US citizen with importing
contraband and evading customs checks. Some view this arrest as a
response to the US criminal investigation of several Chinese
citizens arrested last month for illegally importing automatic
weapons into the US.</p>
<p><strong>UN SANCTIONS</strong><br>
UN sanctions on Iraq will likely be extended. Recent tensions
surrounding the UN Iraqi mission, responsible for investigating
Baghdad's weapons of mass destruction, led the US to threaten to
veto any attempt to lift UN sanctions. Such a move is favored by
Russia and France, opposed by the US and Britain. Iraq must
destroy its stockpiles of chemical, biological, and ballistic
missiles in order for the sanctions to be lifted. </p>
<p><strong>UAE THREATENS US ORDERS</strong><br>
The United Arab Emirates (UAE) threatened to cancel an order for
US made aircraft unless the US agrees to allow the UAE
jurisdiction over US troops involved in crimes there. The Navy,
with the most personnel stationed in the country, is reluctant to
agree to until it has completed a study comparing UAE law to
American law. They fear the Muslim country's law would be much
harsher than American law. However, the proposed aircraft deal is
worth close to $20 billion over a dozen years, and the UAE has
signaled its readiness to walk if the US doesn't meet its
demands.</p>

<P>
  <HR NOSHADE>
<DL>
  <DT>
    <H3>
      What is a Class Action?
    </H3>
  <DD>
    It is a lawsuit where one or more individuals are claiming to represent all
    others who have been similarly injured by the same defendant or group of
    defendants. For example, suppose a defective computer diskette causes a floppy
    drive to ignite and burn once inserted. If 500,000 of those defective diskettes
    are sold, then the purchaser of one diskette might bring a class action against
    the manufacturer seeking to recover damages on behalf of all purchasers.<BR>
    <BR>
    A more detailed description can be found in the special
    <A HREF="http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/rule_23.htm">Federal Rule
    of Civil Procedure for Class Actions</A>.
  <DT>
    <H3>
      Who gets the money in such cases?
    </H3>
  <DD>
    If the person who filed the class action prevails, any award or settlement
    must be made available to all members of the class. Attorneys representing
    the class are also entitled to a reasonable fee. Members of the class are
    not entitled to seek an additional award beyond that obtained by the class
    representative.
  <DT>
    <H3>
      What if the defendant wins?
    </H3>
  <DD>
    A defendant who prevails in a class action is protected from further lawsuits
    by all persons who were members of the class at the time.
  <DT>
    <H3>
      Why is notice important?
    </H3>
  <DD>
    Notice serves three purposes.<BR>
    <P>
    First, potential class members need to be notified that a class lawsuit exists.
    The potential members must decide if they want to remain members of the class
    and be represented by the person who initially brought the lawsuit, or
    <STRONG>"opt out"</STRONG> of the class and do something on their own (like
    bring a separate lawsuit). Generally, if a potential class member fails to
    opt out, the individual is deemed to be a member of the class. Notice is
    necessary to inform class members of the lawsuit and of their ability to
    opt out.
    <P>
    Second, class members need to be notified of a potential settlement, so they
    can provide input on whether the settlement is acceptable.
    <P>
    Third, class member need to be notified when a pool of money or other award
    is available so they can participate and obtain their fair share.
  <DT>
    <H3>
      What sort of notice is required?
    </H3>
  <DD>
    Generally, courts are required to "direct to the members of the class the
    best notice practicable under the circumstances."
  <DT>
    <H3>
      Does this mean that I am entitled to receive notice if I'm a member of a
      class?
    </H3>
  <DD>
    No. The standard is "best practicable" notice, not "actually received" notice.
    There is no requirement of actual notice to a class member, only notice that
    is "reasonably calculated" to reach interested persons. If reasonable efforts
    result in <STRONG>no</STRONG> notice to you, tough luck.
  <DT>
    <H3>
      What do you mean "tough luck"?
    </H3>
  <DD>
    You may totally miss the chance to collect on an award to which you are entitled
    <STRONG>AND</STRONG> you may have lost the opportunity to obtain legal relief
    for yourself.
    <P>
    Consider the case of Mr. Peters, a resident of New York who was injured on
    an Amtrak train following an accident. A class action on behalf of all passengers
    was brought in federal court in Philadelphia. Notice was mailed to the affected
    parties, but Mr. Peters' address was incomplete and he never received notice
    of the lawsuit.
    <P>
    Months after the class action was settled, Mr. Peters sued Amtrak seeking
    $500,000 in compensatory damage and $1 million in punitive damages.
    <P>
    Amtrak argued that Peters could not bring his lawsuit because he was bound
    by the settlement of the class action - he was a member of the class who
    had not opted out. He had lost the right to bring a separate lawsuit on his
    own. Peters argued that he was never given the chance to opt out because
    he had never received notice.
    <P>
    Amtrak won. (And on appeal, Amtrak won again.)
    <P>
    <FONT SIZE=-1> For you legal scholars out there, this case is <CITE>Peters
    v. National Railroad Passenger Corp.</CITE>, 966 F.2d 1483 (D.C. Cir. 1992).
    </FONT>
    <P>
    See generally, "<A HREF="http://www.dorsai.org/~jdadd/georgine.html">Lawsuits
    to End All Lawsuits, Settlements May Limit Victims' Future Right to Sue</A>",
    by Barry Meier, THE NEW YORK TIMES, January 10, 1996.
  <DT>
    <H3>
      What type of notice efforts are considered reasonable?
    </H3>
  <DD>
    Sending notice by mail is almost always considered reasonable. When addresses
    are unobtainable, notice by publication is often used. This means that class
    action notices may be published for one or two days in local, regional or
    national newspapers, and perhaps in a magazine.
  <DT>
    <H3>
      What happens if I don't look at the right page in the selected newspaper
      on the day notice is published?
    </H3>
  <DD>
    You may never know that you are entitled to share in a class award. Or you
    may miss the chance to "opt out" or "opt in" to a class suit.
  <DT>
    <H3>
      What do you mean "opt in"?
    </H3>
  <DD>
    In certain types of class actions an individual must affirmatively request
    to be included as a class member in order to take advantage of an already
    filed suit. For example, class actions under the Age Discrimination in Employment
    Act (ADEA) are governed by the "opt in" rule.
  <DT>
    <H3>
      Wouldn't it make sense to put class notices on the Web, where they would
      be continuously available to millions of individuals?
    </H3>
  <DD>
    Definitely.
  <DT>
    <H3>
      <STRONG>Are most class action notices posted on the Web?</STRONG>
    </H3>
  <DD>
    No.
  <DT>
    <H3>
      <STRONG>Why Not?</STRONG>
    </H3>
  <DD>
    Lawyers and courts have only recently started to incorporate the Internet
    technology into their procedures and decisions. Also, up until recently there
    has not been a central location on the Web for posting class action notices.

<P>
  <HR NOSHADE>
<DL>
  <DT>
    <H3>
      Why would I want to post a Class Action Notice on the Internet?
    </H3>
  <DD>
    The purpose of giving notice to absent class members is to assure procedural
    fairness and due process.
    <A HREF="http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/rule_23.htm">Federal Rule
    of Civil Procedure 23</A> instructs that the notice be the <STRONG>"best
    practicable"</STRONG> under the circumstances, including individual notice
    to members who can be identified through "reasonable" efforts. State rules
    of procedure, from
    <A HREF="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/calaw.html">California</A> to
    <A HREF="http://tally.gulfnet.com/user_pages/fl_law/frcpcon.htm">Florida</A>
    to
    <A HREF="gopher://lbdc.senate.state.ny.us:70/00/.laws/Civil%20Practice%20Law%20%26%20Rules/.CVPA9">New
    York</A>, include similar requirements.<BR>
    <P>
    In addition, Congress recently enacted the
    <A HREF="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c104:H.R.1058.ENR:">Private
    Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995</A> which provides for a
    <STRONG>special early notice</STRONG> in securities class actions to be published
    "in a widely circulated national business-oriented publication or wire service"
    advising members of the purported plaintiff class.
    <P>
    Posting a notice on the Internet may be one of the most cost efficient means
    of reaching millions of potential members. For the modest price of obtaining
    an Internet presence, a document can be posted and made <STRONG>continuously
    available</STRONG> to nearly
    <A HREF="http://www.openmarket.com/over/int_fact.htm">40 million</A> Internet
    users. And the number of users is expected to increase at least fivefold
    by the end of the century.
    <P>
    Courts have broad discretion in formulating standards for appropriate notice.
    Orders are now being fashioned which require Internet posting in addition
    to print media publication. As technology and society advance, notice by
    electronic distribution will become standard.
  <DT>
    <H3>
      OK, the Internet sounds good. But why post at www.notice.com?
    </H3>
  <DD>
    Putting your notice on the Internet isn't enough. It needs to be positioned
    where individuals, who may be unaware that they are potential members of
    a class, might reasonably expect to look.
    <P>
    As of January 1996 <A HREF="http://www.webcom.com/~walsh/stats.html">over
    170,000 commercial domains</A> were registered on the Internet, representing
    an annual increase of 586%. Plus there are tens of thousands of academic,
    governmental and other organizational domains. Each domain may have within
    it an unlimited number of pages.
    <P>
    Every page or document on the Internet has a unique address called its
    <A HREF="http://www.matisse.net/files/glossary.html#URL">URL</A> (uniform
    resource locator). The various <A HREF="http://www.albany.net/allinone/">search
    engines</A> that are available on the Internet indexed an estimated
    <A HREF="http://thirteen.srv.lycos.com/sow/TrueCounting.html">19</A> to
    <A HREF="http://altavista.digital.com/">21</A> <STRONG>million</STRONG> or
    <A HREF="http://www.opentext.com/omw/f-omw-stats.html">more</A> URLs as of
    the beginning of 1996. And the numbers keep growing.
    <P>
    <B>Is it reasonable to expect that a posting on any page will get noticed?</B>
    <P>
    Class actions may cover a wide variety of subjects and may have national
    or international scope. The subject matters range from computer chips to
    polybutylene pipe, from corporate antitrust to consumer fraud. An action
    filed in Alabama may bind class members from Maine to Wyoming.
    <P>
    A central location on the Internet, not limited by considerations of geography
    or topic, is required. A site that not only is registered with all of the
    major search engines, but one where users would naturally expect to find
    a notice of importance.
    <P>
    <FONT SIZE=+1><B>That location is
    <A HREF="http://www.notice.com/">www.notice.com</A>.</B></FONT>
  <DT>
    <H3>
      How do I get my Class Action Notice posted at www.notice.com?
    </H3>
  <DD>
    There are four ways:<BR>
    <P>
    <STRONG>First</STRONG>, if you have a home site on the Internet, you can
    load the notice on a separate page at your site. Then send an email to
    <CITE><A HREF="mailto:legal@notice.com">legal@notice.com</A></CITE> with
    the URL of the notice page along with a 10-to-15 word description to go along
    with it.
    <P>
    <STRONG>Second</STRONG>, you might have the defendant in the class action
    post the notice at a special location at its home on the Internet. See,
    <CITE>e.g.</CITE>, <A HREF="http://www.intel.com/product/pentium/">In re
    INTEL PENTIUM(TM) PROCESSOR LITIGATION</A>, where the notice is posted at
    Intel's site. Again, send an email to
    <CITE><A HREF="mailto:legal@notice.com">legal@notice.com</A></CITE> with
    the URL of the notice along with a brief description.
    <P>
    <STRONG>Third</STRONG>, you might consider going to an independent service
    bureau who would put the notice on a separate page at the bureau's site.
    Again, send an email to
    <CITE><A HREF="mailto:legal@notice.com">legal@notice.com</A></CITE> with
    the URL of the notice location along with a brief description.
    <P>
    <STRONG>Fourth</STRONG>, we will load the notice for you onto a designated
    URL at www.notice.com ("Your-Notice-URL") and then post it. We will also
    keep you advised as to how many times Your-Notice-URL has been visited.
  <DT>
    <H3>
      How much does it cost?
    </H3>
  <DD>
    We post notices <STRONG>without charge</STRONG>. If we load the notice and
    create Your-Notice-URL (option 4 above), there are setup and maintenance
    fees for page development which vary based on the length (number of pages)
    of the notice, the processing required (<I>e.g.</I>, electronic file transfer
    or paper document scan) and the time period for maintenance.
  <DT>
    <H3>
      Will you certify a posting?
    </H3>
  <DD>
    At your request, we will provide a certificate confirming the date that we
    post the URL of your notice. You may also request a certificate of continuity,
    confirming the continuous time period during which we have posted the URL
    of your notice.
    <P>
    Please note: Unless we have loaded the notice and maintained Your-Notice-URL
    (option 4 above), we will not be able to certify that the notice has actually

      Exactly what will you post for free?
    </H3>
  <DD>
    We will post the complaint, proposed settlement, or other judicially approved
    notice document.
    <P>
    We will not post the entire docket file.
  <DT>
    <H3>
      Will you post a summary report of the litigation?
    </H3>
  <DD>
    Some law firms and organizations prepare descriptions of past or current
    litigation work. Such documents, while very informative, are treated as
    promotional material. We invite you to <A HREF="contact1.html">contact us</A>
    about advertising, paid postings and sponsorship opportunities.
  <DT>
    <H3>
      What about notice by email?
    </H3>
  <DD>
    We are unaware of any court that has permitted notice to class members by
    email in lieu of mail sent via the U.S. Postal Service or other delivery
    service. Notice by email would clearly provide an effective backup process,
    and we can provide that service. However, if you know the recipients' email
    addresses, then you really don't need us to transmit the notices unless you
    have administrative or legal concerns. We can also assist in
    <STRONG>locating</STRONG> email addresses for your prospective recipients.

A federal securities class action lawsuit is presently pending against Biogen,
Inc. (NASDAQ: BGEN) and its CEO, James L. Vincent (collectively, the
"Defendants") in the United States District Court for the District of
Massachusetts, entitled <U>In re: Biogen Securities Litigation</U>, Civ.
No. 94-12177-PBS (the "Action"). The complaint in the Action alleges that
the Defendants violated the federal securities laws by making misleading
statements about the results of clinical trials and other information about
Hirulog, one of the company's two key drugs under development. While the
proposed class period in the Action will be longer than the time period set
forth above, plaintiffs are seeking to communicate with persons who purchased
Biogen common stock during the above time period and who would like to
participate as a representative in the Action. If interested, please contact:

<H1 ALIGN=center> The Leadership Advantage <BR>Sneak Peek</H1>



<IMG src="graphics/purpline.gif"></CENTER>



<BR>



<B>Here are four articles from the fall Leadership Advantage newsletter. The actual newsletter is eight pages long and packed with useful articles to enrich your life. If you like what you see and would like more information, please email us at <A HREF="mailto:rpublish@rpublish.com">rpublish@rpublish.com</A>.</B>



<BR>



<BR>



<center><IMG src="graphics/purpline.gif"></CENTER>



<BR>



<img src="graphics/la1196a.gif" align=right hspace=20>







<h2 ALIGN=center> Overcome the Challenges of Success </h2>



Busy people, especially executives, with a strong drive to achieve sometimes fall into what might be called the achiever's trap. Achievers' traps are attitudes and behaviors that limit potential success and destroy creative drive. <p>



<BR>



 Consider these possible traps and take positive action to avoid them:<p>







<ul>



<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Trap One: Doing too much  or not enough. Believe in others and give them the opportunity to accept responsibility for significant achievement. Accept that you can't do everything. However, giving too much of your own responsibilities to others who aren't adequately trained or who don't share your goals may impede your success. Maintain a written delegation plan that details what you plan to delegate and to whom, with checkpoints.


<BR>




<BR>


<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Trap Two: Failure to recognize personal growth needs. Avoid assuming you've learned all you need to know. You still have more potential for achievement. Have a plan of action for personal growth and work toward challenging goals in all areas of your life.


<BR>



<BR>



<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Trap Three: Accepting mediocrity. Pushing for excellence is hard work. Avoid making the mistake of accepting mediocre performance. The "average" isn't enough for one who aspires for real success. Demand outstanding results from yourself and from those associated with you. Keep constant checks on progress toward goals.<BR>



<BR>



<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Trap Four: Failure to use the best qualities of people. Study team members. Examine their strengths, goals and desires. Then, provide them with opportunities to learn new ideas that will make them more valuable as team members and more fulfilled as individuals.<BR>



<BR>



<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Trap Five: Ignoring problems or postponing solutions. The time to solve problems is before they occur. Carefully designed procedures prevent problems or provide for their proper handling if they occur. Hurdle obstacles quickly. Once a solution is found, implement it as quickly as possible.<BR>



<BR>



<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Trap Six: Incomplete communication. Make sure people clearly know what your goals are and how they can help you achieve them. Listen carefully to all information provided by others.<BR>



<BR>



<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Trap Seven: Failure to train a successor. If you want to move up in an organization, the quickest way is to train someone to do your job. By doing so, you're available for new responsibilities. If you're in the top position, train someone to succeed you. If no one is ready to succeed you, the organization may fall when you're no longer there to lead it.<BR>


<BR>




</ul>



<center><IMG src="graphics/purpline.gif"></CENTER>



<BR>



<img src="graphics/la1196b.gif" align=left hspace=20>







<h2 ALIGN=center> Working Effectively Internationally </h2>



 International business may create many obstacles but it also provides many promises. <p>



<BR>






 Most obstacles can be avoided if you prepare sufficiently ahead of time. Here are several suggestions:<p>


<BR>





<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Speak slowly to your clients. Although most international business people speak English, many jargons and other items don't translate well. English may not be your client's first language so be aware of the differences.<BR>







<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Respect instead of rejecting customs you find different. Don't brag about how things are done in your country. Simply state that you've never experienced anything of that manner before. <BR>







<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Remember that nonverbal signs are different in other cultures. Eye contact and personal space change depending on who you're doing business with.<BR>







<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Let your clients lead you along. In America, it's proper to get down to business early. In some cultures, it's offensive not to know your business associates on a personal level first.<BR>


<BR>


<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Adapt to the nuances of other cultures. You're the outsider and should change your habits to appease the locals. Get your hands on a guidebook ahead of time.<BR>


<BR>






</ul>






<center><IMG src="graphics/purpline.gif"></CENTER>



<BR>



<img src="graphics/la1196c.gif" align=right hspace=20>







<h2 ALIGN=center> Prepare Properly for Special Events </h2>

<BR>

 Check for problems you might encounter before your special event occurs with the following checklist:<p>







<ul>



<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Script what everyone will be doing during the event and ask each person to practice their role beforehand.


<BR>




<BR>


<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Pick a good day to hold the event. If something else in your community will compete with you, schedule your event another day.


<BR>



<BR>



<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Establish a planning committee that will assist you in all the planning and coordinating the event entails. A group is much more likely to select the proper individuals for each assignment required to pull off the event.<BR>



<BR>



<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Pre-plan what photos you want taken during the event. If there will be distinguished persons present, it's always nice to be photographed with them since such photos are impressive and can be used later by promoting purposes.<BR>



<BR>



<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Form a scrapbook committee. Ask these employees to compile all the brochures, photos, stories and other material procured from the event in a book and keep the book on file to use as a reference for your next event.<BR>



<BR>



<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Evaluate the event immediately afterwards. Record on paper things you feel were done well and things you'd like to do better the next time you plan an event.<BR>


<BR>




</ul>



<center><IMG src="graphics/purpline.gif"></CENTER>



<BR>



<img src="graphics/la1196d.gif" align=left hspace=20>







<h2 ALIGN=center> Dare to Succeed as a Manager </h2>


Managing is much like being a member of a fraternity or other social group. Traditions and boundaries are rarely crossed and only by those who dare succeed as an individual. Do you have the self-confidence and courage to step out on your own? Or, are you satisfied with the status quo? <p>



<BR>





To break out of the mold other managers have set for you, act upon these ideas:<p>


<BR>





<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Never assume what works for others will work for you. You're a distinct person and have unique ideas that fit your personality and abilities. Believe in yourself and your ideas.<BR>







<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Attend to possible problems before you propose a change. Dealing with obstacles ahead of time helps you pull off your plan with few hitches. <BR>







<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Modify the ideas of others. Some ideas of others can be altered slightly to fit into your own personality style.<BR>







<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Gather ideas from others. Your employees may have great ideas if you listen to them. Keep an open mind and listen to every idea, no matter what the person's position is within the organization.<BR>


<BR>


<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Dare to stand out from the crowd. Let others know that you desire to be successful and are willing to take steps to make it happen.<BR>


<BR>

Avoid these statements: "That's been done before. It won't work," "That's not how things are done around here," "Don't take chances," "Anything that obvious can't be right," or "That's too different." Remain positive in all situations.<BR>
<BR>



</ul>

<h2 ALIGN=center> Hurdle Setbacks in Record Time</h2>
Accidents happen all the time. Some situations get blown out of proportion and require immediate attention to prevent serious consequences. Obviously, true emergencies must be handled immediately, which means pushing aside planned activities and rearranging schedules to take care of the emergency. <p>
<BR>
 Here's a game plan that is sure to carry your organization or yourself over temporary hurdles and back to normal business:<p>

<ul>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Stay calm. Tell yourself, "I've solved more difficult problems under pressure. I can solve this one, too." Your calm, matter-of-fact acceptance of the situation and the assumption that it can be handled keep both you and others calm and able to bring the situation under control.
<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Isolate the major consideration. When a crisis occurs, something will probably be lost as a result of the situation  either time, money, or materials. Decide what loss can be tolerated and what loss must be avoided. Isolate the root of the problem so you can immediately respond to the real issue. Your objective is to solve the problem and regain control without a crucial loss.
<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Return conditions to normal as soon as possible. Make the suggestion, take the action, give the instructions, and let everything return to normal. The objective for leaders in crisis management is to take personal charge of the situation for only as long as you're needed.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Learn something from the situation. The handling of the crisis situation should have a direct contribution to crisis prevention in the future.<BR>
<BR>
</ul>

<h2 ALIGN=center> Direct Your Life With a Positive Outlook </h2>
Disagreeable experiences of any kind  inconvenience, trouble, embarrassment, delays, loss, or unexpected effort  are triggers for negative emotions. But, to be effective, achievers must deal with their negative emotions and project a positive outlook in all situations. <p>
<BR>

Achievers set goals, dedicate themselves to achieving them, concentrate on using their strengths, and work to turn weaknesses into strengths. Combining their positive qualities, achievers form an overall frame of mind, or positive outlook, that enables them to triumph over negative emotions. <p>
<BR>

Through practice and repetition, you can develop positive habits of thinking just as you can develop positive habits of behavior. Your mind believes what you tell it, and your body receives directions from your mind. Tell yourself constantly that you can overcome negative emotions  your mind and body will obey you. By applying this truth in your life, you will be well on your way to possessing a positive mental outlook. <p>
<BR>

Communicate more useful, positive emotions when you're faced with negative situations by using these suggestions:<p>

<ul>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Honestly evaluate your present attitude. Get a clear picture of how you view yourself, others, and various situations. Identify attitudes you admire and those you would like to change. Then, set goals to make positive changes.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Note people and situations that cause negative emotions to surface. Decide in advance how you intend to think, feel and act when an undesirable situation occurs. Visualize yourself handling the situation positively. <BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Think before you act. Deliberately act the part as you've planned and visualized, regardless of how you feel at the moment. Resolve to keep a level head no matter what others say or do.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Avoid harboring ill feelings. Realize that people have sufficient reasons for whatever they do or say at any given time. Try to be more understanding of others in negative situations.<BR>
<BR>


<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Dispose of regrets. Discard false hopes, drop impractical expectations, and identify and present new options for the future. Work with others to find positive solutions to problems.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Put small, everyday pains out of your mind. Keep your thoughts focused on accomplishing your goals instead of on the pressures and obstacles that stand between you and reaching your goals. Let your positive outlook on life direct you to overcome negative emotions that stand between you and the success you deserve.<BR>

<h2 ALIGN=center>Put Off Procrastination - Tackle Tasks Today</h2>
Procrastination is defined in the dictionary as "to put off until some later." Do you put things off until a later time? If so, you may have been bitten by the procrastination bug. <p>
<BR>
Most people procrastinate in at least one area of their life  at home, at work, at school, and other areas. In fact, procrastination has made an appearance in everyone's life at some point. But if your goal is to succeed, defeating the procrastination bug is necessary and important to achieving your dreams. <p>
<BR>


Consider these ways of defeating the procrastination bug:<p>

<ul>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Break projects into smaller parts. In five minutes, you could complete a task that brings you closer to your goal.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Set deadlines for yourself. Having a date to shoot for in each step will spur you onward. Hold yourself accountable to the deadlines you set. <BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Consider all your high priority "to-dos" on your planner as immovable. They all must be accomplished before you can go home or move to the next task.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Get started. Once the project is moving, procrastination problems disappear.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Find a simpler way to do the same task. You may be making it harder than it actually is. Simplify and delegate.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Use "free" time to work hard. When meetings or trips are canceled, use the time you had devoted to them to complete a lengthy project.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Use your mood swings. When you're angry, tackle high-energy tasks and when you're calm, work on the deep thinking ones.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Clear off your desk and concentrate only on one task. Design your work area productively. Keep all those items you use or need for projects nearby.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Log your current time use. It may not take as long as you remember to complete each task. Review your log and look for ways to improve productivity.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Do tasks before they pile up. Complete your correspondence duties when the mail arrives, for example.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Enjoy your leisure time. This refreshes you so you work better. Avoid worry. Worrying only stresses you out.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Give yourself rewards  small ones for each step along the way and larger ones for the final completion of a project.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Add more time to your day. Get up earlier or take shorter lunches. You'll get more done and feel more satisfied.<BR>
</ul>
<center><IMG src="graphics/purpline.gif"></CENTER>
<BR>
<img src="graphics/tm896b.gif" align=left hspace=20>

<h2 ALIGN=center>Rescuing Your Lost Time</h2>
Time wasted is time lost. Most people don't intend to waste their time but end up doing just that with misguided efforts that they truly believe will save them time. Are you wasting your time? <p>
<BR>

Any affirmative answers to the following questions means you could spend your time better:<p>

<ul>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Do you worry about anything more than once a day? Worrying is a waste of time every time.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Do you take days off work just because you feel like it? Getting away from work occasionally can refresh you but abuse of this can make you fall behind. <BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Do you complete all your tasks yourself and seldom delegate to others? Realize that other people can do some of your tasks just as productively as you.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Do you bother with too many details? Some of those small matters could surprise you by solving themselves.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Do you daydream daily? Although daydreaming is effective some of the time, daily daydreaming is too often.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Do you sometimes wonder where all your time goes? Effective time managers recognize time's value and utilize every minute of it.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Do you substitute more pleasant tasks for those that must

<h2 ALIGN=center> The Friendship Factor: Are You Being a Good Friend?</h2>
An old expression claims that genuine friendship is like sound health; its value is seldom known until it's lost. We believe that friendship is not only similar to good health, but it also plays a key role in good health. For that reason, everyone should take time to develop and nurture genuine friendships. <p>
<BR>

How Good a Friend Are You?
<p>
<BR>

To have a good friend, you must be a good friend, one willing to devote time and effort to the relationship. The following quiz will help determine how much you know about friendship: (Answer True or False)<p>

<ul>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> 1. Envy is a normal part of many friendships.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> 2. It's possible to have too many friends. <BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> 3. In selecting friends, you should look for people of similar age and with similar backgrounds.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> 4. It's more difficult to make friends now than 20 years ago.<BR>
<BR>


<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> 5. It's possible to outgrow friends.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> 6. Friendships that are too strong can be harmful.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> 7. In our mobile society, long-term friendships are nearly impossible.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> 8. A male-female friendship is not always the first step toward romance, but can be a healthy sign of the times.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> 9. The best friendships are 50-50 kinds of relationships.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> 10. Some people find it very difficult to make friends.<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
<img src="graphics/co896b2.gif" align=left hspace=20>

<BR><BR>
Answers:<BR><BR>

<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> 1. True, but that doesn't mean it should destroy the relationship. Be honest about it; admit to your friends that they have a talent or quality you envy. They may respond with a similar "confession."<BR>
<BR>

<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> 2. True, if your purpose is merely to clutter your social calendar and keep yourself so busy that you escape solitude. Most people maintain friendships of different degrees. Friends range from pleasant acquaintances to intimate soulmates.<BR>
<BR>

<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> 3. False. It's healthy to have friends who span the age brackets and who represent different socioeconomic backgrounds. Acceptance is the key. For a friendship to flourish, friends must accept each other for what they are and not try to initiate changes.<BR>
<BR>

<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> 4. True. Think of how our society has been altered in the last few decades: More women are in the workforce; life in the suburbs means longer commuting times; families are relocating more often; people are more security-minded and install fences and other "barriers"; the competitive nature of big business pits peers against each other in a survival-of-the-fittest kind of environment; and working couples, tired at the end of the week, choose to withdraw and get away rather than seek the company of others.<BR>
<BR>

<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> 5. True. Two women may be drawn together because they have children involved in the same activities. The women work on committees together, share carpool duties and enjoy discussing their common interests. After the children are grown, the women find they have less and less to discuss. The relationship ends quietly and naturally.<BR>
<BR>

<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> 6. True. It's possible to be too good a friend during a crisis and actually make an unhappy situation worse. First, you can hover over hurting friends and almost smother them with concern. Second, you can empathize with hurting friends to the point of adding to their suffering. By assuming their burden, you try to lighten it, but the opposite occurs.<BR>
<BR>

<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> 7. False. They merely require more work. Several ingenious methods can keep friendships alive and well. Cassette tapes can be recorded and swapped by mail; long-distance phone visits can take place often; same-time-next-year vacations can be arranged at a location convenient to both.<BR>
<BR>

<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> 8. True. Many men and women view each other as colleagues who share common interests and goals. No longer does a male-female relationship have to be based on romantic attractions. Men now feel less of a need to be macho with a female friend, and women don't try to be "one of the boys."<BR>
<BR>

<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> 9. True. A one-way friendship can be the source of great anxiety. An equal give-and-take friendship develops both partners.<BR>
<BR>

<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> 10. True. To make friends easily, you must project friendliness. This involves taking the risk of being rejected. Often, persons who are preoccupied with themselves aren't willing to show their vulnerability to others.<BR>
<BR>

<h2 ALIGN=center> Overcome Control Addiction With Deliberate Choices</h2>
Most of us, to some degree or another, like to be in control. For some, the ability to take command, organize and exercise leadership is a positive strength. But this strength can quickly turn into a disastrous weakness when it disrupts our most important relationships  family relationships, friendships, and business relationships. At the point where our urge to control becomes compulsive, unrestrainable and destructive to relationships, it's become control addiction. <p>
<BR>
Control-addicted people are often unaware that they have a problem  or that they create problems for other people. They tend to be so convinced of the correctness of their opinion, methods and priorities that they can scarcely tolerate anyone or anything that contradicts them. They tend to feel driven by a sense of duty and generally act superior on the outside while feeling inferior on the inside. <p><BR>

Self Test: Do You Have a Control Addiction?<p><BR>

Take the following quiz to see if you may be addicted to control. Check the statements below that apply to you:<p>

<ul>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> I hate to admit my weaknesses, even if they seem obvious to others.
<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> I get irritated when other people make mistakes.
<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> I tend to use words like should, ought, must, and can't when I'm talking to other people.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> I tend to do an important job myself because others might not do it right.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> I'm annoyed and upset more often than I'd like to be.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Once I've formulated an opinion, I don't tend to change it.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> I stay away from people whose opinions are different from mine.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> When I'm working on a project, I often become so focused that I get irritated when people interrupt me and I tend to snap at them.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> I get impatient when other people can't understand what needs to be done.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> I would rather let people have a false favorable impression of me than be open and vulnerable.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> When someone tells me about a personal problem, I feel I have to find a solution.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> I use silence to punish those who disappoint or disagree with me.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Before starting a project, I dwell on it constantly to be sure I'll do it just right.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> When someone else is in a foul mood, it puts me in a foul mood too.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Critical thoughts come to my mind more often than I'd like.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> When someone confronts me about my opinions or beliefs, I immediately begin to formulate a rebuttal.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> I have a mental list of standards people should meet before I accept them.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> I sometimes resent having to do so much for my family.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> I'm uncomfortable when others share very personal emotions with me.<BR>
<BR>
The average person will check a few of these statements. If you checked fewer than five, you're very serene and composed  or else you need to see yourself more positively. If you checked five to eight statements, you're probably fairly normal. If you checked nine or more statements, you're a likely candidate for unnecessary emotional stress and tension  and you exhibit signs of a strong need to control. Your controlling tendencies are going to create problems for you and the people around you. They will continually interfere with your relationships, and with your happiness and self-esteem.<BR><BR>

Control-addicted people can free themselves from the need always to be right; they can give themselves and others the freedom to be human and to make mistakes. The key to recovery lies in (1) understanding the addiction and (2) yielding that addiction for healing.<BR><BR>

Yielding The Addiction<BR><BR>

How can this addiction be cured? It must be yielded, moment by moment. If you're a control addict, learn to make these deliberate choices: <BR><BR>

<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> "I choose to let others be themselves." This means allowing your children to make their own mistakes and to be human. It means letting your spouse's imperfections slide past without comment, without resentment. It means giving more slack to your friends and employees. It also means not taking over and doing things for other people in the belief they won't do it right. It means you stop pushing others to get their work done, to get to an appointment on time and to do their work better. Instead, positively encourage others to be responsible for their actions  and step back and let them act.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> "I choose to let me be me." The same grace you're attempting to give to others you must also give to yourself. When you feel tempted to judge yourself for a mistake, stop. Say to yourself, "I'm only human." Give yourself the right to make mistakes  even an occasional relapse into old controlling patterns. Give yourself the right to make human mistakes.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> "I choose to live humbly." No more acting superior while feeling inferior. From now on, you don't have to be perfect, you don't have to be right, you don't have to hide your weaknesses, and you don't have to maintain an image. Try to see every irritation, setback, and disappointment in life as a chance to learn more about humility, and in time you'll see a pattern of humility seeping into your life.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> "I choose to be firm without being controlling." No one is suggesting you go from being a controller to being a pushover. You can still be firm in your convictions while being open-minded and a good listener. You can be a leader without being a controller. You can be organized without being a hyperperfectionist. Practice being assertively firm without resorting to sarcasm, manipulation, accusations, the silent treatment, or a coercive tone of voice.<BR>

<h2 ALIGN=center> Eating Disorders: Know The Signs</h2>
Despite frantic efforts to revive her, Karen Carpenter was pronounced dead at the hospital at the age of 32. She had collapsed at her home and went into cardiac arrest. Cause of death: malnutrition, due to anorexia nervosa. A related affliction, bulimia, has also taken its toll of lives. <p>
<BR>
Anorexia nervosa and bulimia are closely related eating disorders. They are characterized by the compulsive drive to control weight by unhealthy means. Anorexia nervosa is defined as self-induced starvation resulting in extreme, often life-threatening weight loss. Bulimia is defined as a pattern of overindulging in food, followed by self-induced vomiting or abuse of laxatives in order to produce weight loss. <p><BR>

Authorities estimate that about one percent of women between ages 12 and 25 suffer from anorexia, and about one and a half percent in that age group suffer from bulimia. These disorders are commonly seen as women's disorders, although about 10 percent of anorexics or bulimics are men.<p><BR>

The effects of anorexia nervosa and bulimia are devastating to the medical , emotional, and even spiritual well-being. Some effects include:<p>

<ul>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> a menstrual cycle that stops temporarily or becomes irregular;
<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> digestive impairment, resulting from the abuse of laxatives;
<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> imbalance of electrolytes in the body, causing irregular heartbeat and in extreme cases heart failure and death;<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> low white blood cell count (anemia) and impaired immune system;<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> inflammation of the esophagus, resulting from self-induced vomiting;<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> erosion of tooth enamel, owing to gastric acids from self-induced vomiting;<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> brain and central nervous system disorders, including seizures;<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> glandular dysfunctions, including thyroid abnormalities, resulting in fatigue;<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> kidney problems;<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> accumulation of abdominal fluids, resulting in a "potbelly";<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> hiatal hernias;<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> low blood sugar, resulting in headaches and dizziness;<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> musculoskeletal problems from potassium deficiency, resulting in muscle spasms, pain, and muscle atrophy; and<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> dry skin and thinning hair.<BR>
<BR>
A key issue to be resolved in the recovery process for anorexia nervosa and bulimia is the issue of body image. Most anorexics and bulimics hate what they see when they look in the mirror. This condition, which Minirith Meier New Life Clinics calls body hate, is quite common, particularly among women, whether a person has an eating disorder or not. People with body hate dwell on the flaws and have little or no awareness of their positive features. Body hate is exacerbated by a culture that emphasizes standards of beauty that equate being attractive with being thin. In people with eating disorders, body hate takes on excessive proportions, compelling them to reach for an impossible ideal.<BR>
<BR>
 What should you do if a close friend or loved one shows signs of anorexia or bulimia? Here are several steps to take:<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Lovingly confront them about their symptoms.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Seek professional medical help for family members who are minors.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Seek professional therapy and emotional support for them.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Be candid about their appearance. Tell them if they look unhealthy. (Make sure your honesty is coated with love.)<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Listen and empathize. Let them sense your love and understanding. Avoid judging or criticizing.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Show love and unconditional acceptance. Persevere during the healing process and seek always to demonstrate affection and acceptance, even when it's not easy.<BR>

<h2 ALIGN=center> Five Essentials to a Great Marriage</h2>
There are 107 million married people in the United States and many of them are aching for a better marriage. In fact, it's predicted that 66 percent of all marriages that begin this year in the United States will end in separation or divorce. <p>
<BR>

In an effort to discover how couples can move from having an ordinary relationship to an extraordinary marriage, Neil Clark Warren, Ph.D., a clinical psychologist from Pasadena, California, surveyed 100 couples with "extremely healthy" marriages to unveil their secrets. His research reveals that there are 10 "secrets" to creating a brilliant marriage  five of them are absolutely essential.<p>
<BR>

The Five Essentials of a Great Marriage<p>

<ul>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Dream a big dream for your marriage. Warren suggests a husband and wife construct a vision of everything their marriage can be. His research couples claimed that although they often lived day-by-day, they had a great overall vision for their relationships that guided their marriages. "Every couple needs to have a vision for their future," Warren says. "And they need to keep that vision up-to-date and carefully focused."<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Learn to talk. Master healthy communication.  All the survey participants responded that communication will give couples the wherewithal to express the strongest desires of their hearts, the most profound thoughts of their brains, and the most sensitive concerns of their souls. <BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Work it through. Conflict is inevitable so learn to handle it productively. Nearly 50 percent of all divorces take place within three years of the wedding day. This means a lot of couples can't resolve conflict. Warren's 30 years of clinical practice have taught him that the amount of conflict in a marriage only determines the speed at which the marriage is moving toward greatness or toward destruction. "Conflict, well managed, is like a stairway that can lead you to higher and higher levels of marital brilliance," he says.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Negotiate a mutually satisfying sexual relationship. Work on chemistry. The 200 people in Warren's survey reported a broad range of sexual satisfaction. From his research, Warren believes that sex by itself usually isn't vital enough to devastate any marriage if other factions are sufficiently positive. But he's convinced that if every couple can be taught to improve their sexual relationship by just 10 percent, the divorce rate would be lowered by 10 percent.<BR>
<BR>


<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Pursue spirituality! Partners in great marriages find significance in their spiritual lives. The 100 couples in Warren's sample consistently cited some form of "spirituality" as crucial to the development of their extremely healthy marriages. They pointed out what's been recognized for a long time  that when a couple gets spiritually healthy, they automatically move a significant distance in the direction of marital oneness.<BR>
<BR>
Finally, Warren advised that most marriages are incredibly complex. They can't be revolutionized overnight, but can move from ordinary to magnificent over time.<BR>

<h2 ALIGN=center> Get a Good Night's Rest </h2>
Today, people tend to be working more and resting less. In fact, for most people, there aren't enough hours in the day for all that needs to be accomplished, so they steal from the night. According to the Better Sleep Council, over the last century, Americans have cut the average nightly hours of sleep by more than 20 percent.<p>
According to American Demographics, adults who sleep six or fewer hours each night are significantly more likely than those who get more sleep to feel stressed every day. In contrast, only 14 percent of adults who sleep seven to eight hours each night feel stress daily.<p>
<BR>

Good sleep habits are vital to stress prevention. To build good sleep habits, consider the following:<p>

<ul>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Stick to a schedule. Get up and go to bed at the same time each day.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Exercise regularly. Exercise encourages sleep by burning off tensions. <BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Avoid stimulants. Drink caffeinated drinks no closer than six to eight hours before your bedtime.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Buy a good bed. Choose a bed that offers both comfort and support.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Stop smoking. Nicotine is a stronger stimulant than caffeine.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Skip the after-dinner drink. Alcohol makes it more difficult to stay asleep.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Strive for quality sleep. Don't feel you have to sleep eight hours; seven may be enough for you.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Set aside worries. Deal with them the next day.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Skip high-fat snacks before bedtime. If you're hungry, eat a low-calorie snack, like a banana or an apple.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Relax before going to bed. Listen to music, take a warm bath, or read a book before going to sleep.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Keep your bedroom quiet, comfortable, dark and cool. Keep yourself warm with a blanket or comforter.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Avoid using your bedroom as your office or television room.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Lose weight. People who are overweight tend to snore more, which can lead to inadequate sleep.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Be wary of over-the-counter sleep aids. Talk to your doctor about sleep medications.<BR>
<BR>

<h2 ALIGN=center> Run For the Health of It </h2>
For those who haven't broken a sweat in some time, begin slowly with any exercise program. Just like a well-built house, a new running program will need to have a solid foundation first. <p>
<BR> The best way to establish this foundation is to mix walking and jogging when you begin your program. You should do your running regimen every other day or at least three days a week. <p>
<BR>
To build your personalized running program, consider these precautions for exercising safely:<p>

<ul>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Let your exercise endurance build gradually. Don't try to do too much too soon or soreness will set in and you won't want to continue exercising.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif">Include stretching, warmup and cool-down segments in each running session. Stretching the major muscles will help you avoid injuries. Walking before running will warm your muscles up. And, walking again at the end and then stretching again will cool your body safely back down. <BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif">Pay attention to pain warnings. If your joints, feet, ankles, or legs ache, it could be an early warning that further stress could result in a worse injury. Treat these painful warnings with rest and over-the-counter pain relievers.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif">Stop exercising if you feel pain in your chest. This could be a sign of heart attack and further exercise could damage your heart seriously. Any pain or pressure in the left or mid-chest area, left neck, shoulder, or arm, sudden lightheadedness, cold sweat, pallor, or fainting should tell you to stop exercising and call your doctor.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif">Suit your attire and preparation to your weather conditions:  <BR>
	For hot and humid areas, exercise in the early morning before sunrise or early evening after the sunset when it's cooler, adapt to the heat for a week before undergoing rigorous routines, drink lots of water, look for the signs of heat stroke (dizziness, weakness, lightheadedness, tiredness, lack of sweat, or dangerously high body temperature), wear lightweight, light-colored, loose-fitting clothes, and avoid wearing rubberized or plastic weight loss suits or sweatshirts and sweat pants since they won't help you lose weight any faster (you only sweat more) and could cause heat stroke.<BR>
	For cold areas, wear layered clothing but wear one less layer than you would if you were outside and not exercising, protect your hands with mittens, gloves, or cotton socks, and wear a hat or cap to retain heat since almost 40 percent of your body's heat is lost through your neck and head.<BR>
	For rainy, icy, or snowy areas, realize that visibility levels and traction will be lower for both you and any drivers on nearby roads.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Eat meals at least two hours before you exercise and don't eat until at least 20 minutes after completing your exercising.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Select good running shoes that have proper cushioning in the soles.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Run on soft, even surfaces such as grass fields, dirt paths, or tracks instead of cement or hilly places that are rough on your feet and joints.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> As you run, land on the heels of your feet instead of on the balls of your feet to minimize strain on your feet and lower legs.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Watch for cars and wear reflective clothing if you run on a road at night. You'll see cars well before their drivers see you.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> When weather does prevent your normal running routine, visit your local mall and walk for double the time you would have jogged.<BR>
<BR>
For more information, contact your local American Heart Association or call 1-800-242-8721.

<h2 ALIGN=center> Fight Heart Disease with Heart Healthy Eating </h2>
Your food habits are one of the major risk factors for heart disease, but you can control them! To decrease your risk of heart disease, your eating plan should contain less saturated fatty acids and cholesterol. <p>
<BR>

The American Heart Association (AHA) suggests abiding by these guidelines:<p>

<ul>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Your daily fat intake should be less than 30 percent of your total daily calories.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Saturated fatty acid intake should be less than 10 percent of your total daily calories. <BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Polyunsaturated fatty acid intake should be no more than 10 percent of your total daily calories.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Monounsaturated fatty acids should be about 10 to 15 percent of your total daily calories.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Cholesterol daily intake should not exceed 300 milligrams.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Sodium intake should be no more than 3,000 milligrams daily.<BR>
<BR>
Since adhering to those more technical recommendations may be tedious with all the calculating, the AHA also wants to pass along these tips:<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Eat nonfat products. Fruits, vegetables and their juices are low in fat and valuable nutritionally. Other nonfat products can be substituted for their fatty counterparts with little or no loss of taste. For example, substitute angel food cake for devil's food cake or nonfat salad dressing for regular salad dressing.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Select products low in fat. Use mustard, ketchup, or low-fat mayonnaise instead of regular mayonnaise to complement sandwiches. Choose baked foods over fried ones.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Buy lean meats. Fish, chicken, turkey and lean cuts of beef and pork are wise choices. You should only have two to three servings of meat daily. A serving is three ounces or about the size of a deck of cards.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Switch to low-fat milk. Work at gradually reducing the fat content of the milk you drink. Start with two percent, move to one percent, then to half percent and finally to skim milk. Low-fat buttermilk is a tasteful alternative to whole milk and substituting evaporated skim milk for cream or half-n-half is wise.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Try low-fat and nonfat cheeses and dairy products. Instead of regular cheese, choose low- or nonfat varieties including cottage cheese, reduced-fat ricotta cheese and skim milk mozzarella cheese.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Enjoy low-fat desserts. Enjoy a frozen fruit bar instead of an ice cream bar, and choose sherbet, frozen low-fat yogurt, or ice milk instead of traditional ice cream.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Cut the fat out of your bread, cereal and pasta selections. Eat a bagel instead of a doughnut, cereal instead of pastries, and warm corn tortillas instead of biscuits. Baked potatoes and pasta are very low in fat if you avoid high-fat toppings.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Eat eggs, but throw out the yolk first. Use the egg whites or choose an egg substitute to make scrambled eggs, omelets, nonfat frostings, cakes, cookies and muffins. Remember that it takes two egg whites to equal one whole egg.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Avoid fried foods. Choose from baking, broiling, steaming, boiling, poaching, or microwaving.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Learn to enjoy the true taste of foods. Avoid drowning in gravies, sauces and other toppings.<BR>

<h2 ALIGN=center> Protect Against Periodontal Disease </h2>
Daily brushing and flossing are essential to proper dental care. Without proper care, periodontal disease  disorders which affect the gums and other supporting structures around the teeth  may set in. If this happens you risk tooth loss, and if left untreated, bone damage. <p>
<BR> The symptoms of peridontal disease are: red and swollen gums, bad breath, gum bleeding when brushing teeth, sensitivity to hot, cold, or sweet foods and liquids, and loose teeth.<p>
<BR>

To avoid peridontal disease:<p>

<ul>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Brush your teeth daily (at least twice).<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Use a toothpaste that contains fluoride. <BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Control oral bacteria with an antiseptic mouthwash. A mild solution of one part hydrogen peroxide to 10 parts water helps kill bacteria.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Floss your teeth daily to remove plaque.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Visit your dentist regularly.<BR>

<h2 ALIGN=center> Get a Grip on Your Temper </h2>
If you blow your top often over things that aren't all that important, you must get a grip on your anger before it takes over your life  and destroys your relationships. <p>
<BR>

When you notice anger creeping up on you, challenge it by taking these steps:<p>

<ul>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Negotiate peace. Replace your anger-producing thoughts with thoughts of mercy toward others.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Offer alternatives to becoming angry. Instead of growing angry toward someone who is short with you, put yourself in their shoes before passing judgment. <BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Write a peace treaty. Jot down thoughts and other items that ignite your anger and analyze them realistically. This will usually cause you to see situations more rationally.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Get your mind off your anger. Take a break by distracting yourself with something you enjoy.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Stop what you're doing and exercise. Exercise produces endorphins in the brain which naturally improve your mood. Relaxation techniques work just as well. Try taking several deep breaths if exercise isn't possible.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Let your anger take its course  alone. Go somewhere by yourself for at least 20 minutes. Return with a relaxed mind and look at the anger-producing situation with clear thoughts.<BR><BR>

<h2 ALIGN=center> Develop Self-Discipline to Succeed </h2>
Would you like to improve the quality of your life? Then commit to positive lifestyle changes and overcome self-defeating habits. To do so, develop the power of self-discipline. <p>
<BR>

Self-discipline means you work wholeheartedly and continuously toward a goal until it's achieved. Develop your self-discipline with these easy steps:<p>

<ul>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Decide upon your mission. Write down five things you want most in life. Some may seem dreamy but others will be achievable. Combine them into one statement that summarizes your goals in life.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Set goals. Goals work as self-fulfilling prophecies. Whatever level of success you set your sights on is usually as high as you'll go. So, set your goals high. <BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Take action consistently. Obstacles may impede your progress. Jump over them by identifying possible obstacles ahead of time so you can handle them efficiently and productively if they occur. Keep going even through obstacles.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Visualize your success. Close your eyes and see yourself as the success you want to be. Your brain often converts images into reality.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Enjoy the pursuit of your goals. If you truly desire goal achievement, you'll enjoy working toward the goals. Pursue your goals with a positive attitude.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Focus on the tasks at hand. Life in today's society is complex. To truly succeed, you have to be able to forget about other matters and concentrate on what's happening before you.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Eliminate excuses. When you falter from time to time, don't fall back into old patterns by using an excuse. Focus on what you've already accomplished.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Reward yourself. When you achieve your goal, take time to reward yourself because you worked hard to get where you are.<BR>
<BR>

</ul>

<BR>
<img src="graphics/nov96g.gif" align=left hspace=20>

<h2 ALIGN=center> Pinpoint Your Body's Peak Times </h2>
During the day, your body undergoes many changes. Your mental, physical and emotional condition goes through summits, plateaus and valleys. Your body has a definite rhythm in which your blood pressure, body temperature, hormonal production and other bodily functions follow. <p>
<BR> Some people rise early in the morning and spring forward to face their day but start running on empty in the early evening. Others begin their day slowly but hit their peak in the early evening and work late into the night. Good timing of daily activities is important. <p>
<BR>

Most studies would agree that there really is a "best time" to do things. Consider these tips:<p>

<ul>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif">Eat wise. In most cases, modern research supports this advice, "Eat breakfast like a king, lunch like a prince, and dinner like a pauper." This eating plan can improve energy levels and help you lose weight since your body burns more calories while you're active.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif">Exercise when it's best for you. If you're trying to lose weight, working out at lunch or before dinner may suppress your appetite. If you work, exercising during lunch time may help you overcome the afternoon "slump" at the office. If you do work out during lunch, also be sure to eat a light, healthy lunch. And remember, exercising too close to bedtime may make you so charged up you can't sleep. <BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Map your ups and downs. If you struggle with figuring out your rhythm, keep a log of your accomplishments during the day. Review the times of the day when you tend to accomplish the most. Then, focus on important activities during these times.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif">Take your medications on time. Whether you take your medication during the day or night can make a difference in what it does to your body. Always follow your doctor's advice on when to take medications.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Educate yourself when you're ready to learn. The best time to learn is when you feel your alertness is in full swing. Often, late-night studying may give you the edge on tomorrow's test, but not on long-term recall.<BR>
<BR>

<IMG src="graphics/pat_circles.gif"></center><P>
<b>We, at Total Wellness, believe that improving lifestyle habits takes more than just regular exercise and good nutrition. It involves setting goals and taking action in all areas of life. This is why we base our monthly, eight-page wellness newsletter on the Total Person Concept, which focuses on the six areas of life that together make up the total person.<P>

<center><IMG src="graphics/tpcwheel.gif"></center><P>

We have designed Total Wellness so that it provides your employees with the facts and motivation to target wellness in all of these areas. Some of the features of Total Wellness include:<P>

</TABLE></center><P>

When your employees receive an issue of Total Wellness with your company logo at the top, it sends them a message that management cares about their health and well-being. By putting our Total Person Concept into action, you can lower the absentee rate and the number of on-the-job accidents, reduce substance abuse, and promote general good health among employees and their families.

<h2>History</h2>







<B>Total Wellness  is published by Rutherford Publishing, Inc., which is part of a family of companies dedicated to helping people reach their full potential. Paul J. Meyer founded the first company, Success Motivation Institute, Inc. (SMI), in 1960. SMI is the world's largest producer of programs on personal goal setting, sales management, time management, sales training, and management training. All of the SMI programs and courses, which are translated into 17 languages and sold in more than 60 countries, are based on the Total Person Concept . The Total Person Concept , which focuses on the six areas of life that together make up the total person, was established by Paul J. Meyer 35 years ago. The Total Person Concept  developed into the Total Wellness  newsletter in September, 1993, when Rutherford Publishing, Inc. joined the Paul J. Meyer family of  more than 40 companies.











<h2>Concept</h2>







Rutherford Publishing, Inc. believes that wellness is a way of life. Total Wellness  is based on the Total Person Concept , which was taught by Paul J. Meyer more than 35 years ago and applied to over 20 full-length personal and professional improvement programs and courses. The Total Person Concept  focuses on the six areas of life that together make up the total person. Through Total Wellness , Rutherford Publishing, Inc. encourages individuals to set personal goals and take action in all of the key areas of life which make up the total person.<P>







<center><IMG src="graphics/tpcwheel.gif" ALT="Wheel of Life"></center><P>







Total Wellness  provides readers with the facts and the motivation to target wellness in all of these areas. At the same time, Total Wellness  provides information to reduce the incidence of injury, illness, and absenteeism on the job. Other topics include improving doctor/patient relations; balancing work and home life; preventing minor and major illnesses like heart disease, cancer, high blood pressure, osteoporosis, and diabetes; simple guidelines for safety, including seat belts, job safety issues, and home accident prevention; and tips for quitting smoking, reducing stress, building self-esteem, and recognizing the signs of substance abuse. 







<h2>Content/Selection Process</h2>







A concentrated effort is made by the editorial staff at Rutherford Publishing, Inc. to review and summarize the latest in wellness information and research. Rutherford Publishing, Inc. uses reliable resource materials, includes a variety of topics each month, and always encourages readers to share suggestions for articles they would like to see in the newsletter. Rutherford Publishing, Inc. realizes the importance of reader input and offers a 24-hour suggestion hotline for readers to call and leave their topic suggestions. <p>

It is written in a positive, non-judgmental style with a mixture of humor and non-threatening technical terms. All articles and illustrations are original and designed to inform, educate, motivate and entertain.<p>







Total Wellness   contains current information that is pertinent to readers. The majority of articles include step-by-step suggestions on how a person can take positive actions in their own life toward total wellness. The articles are well-researched and sources are cited for most information. Rutherford Publishing, Inc. follows the Health Observances and Recognition calendar published by the American Society for Health Care Marketing and Public Relations of the American Hospital Association. This calendar features monthly and weekly national wellness events as well as special recognition days for each month of the year.<p>

Total Wellness  always strives to maintain optimum use of print space and include at least one illustration per page.<p>







Topics for Total Wellness  evolve from careful, ongoing research and planning by the managing editor and chief editor. Before developing the topic list and writing each issue, the editorial staff has a pre-issue briefing to discuss and brainstorm ideas and current developments in wellness. Each topic is weighed according to its contribution to the Total Person Concept. Total Wellness  focuses on providing people with the facts and motivation to become better informed about and take more responsibility for their own health.

<h2 ALIGN=center>Test Your Skills: Do You Lead Effective Meetings?</h2>



Conducting business meetings requires a talent of its own. In no other arena do you have to be leader, encourager, entertainer, speaker, listener, and facilitator all at the same time. Do you have what it takes to lead an effective meeting? <p>



<BR>



 Take this quiz to find out. (Answer True or False)<p>







<ul>



<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> 1. Weekly staff meetings are a good idea to keep everyone on track for the week's work.


<BR>




<BR>


<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> 2. Body language is less important in meetings than it is during non-meeting occasions.


<BR>



<BR>



<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> 3. Conference calls and computer conferencing can never replace traditional in-person meetings.<BR>



<BR>



<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> 4. Always attend meetings yourself. Sending another person insults the person who called the meeting and intimidates the person you send.<BR>



<BR>



<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> 5. You should group your meetings together consecutively during one morning.<BR>



<BR>



<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> 6. Meeting times should be made in advance along with the meeting's ending times.<BR>



<BR>



<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> 7. You should schedule a "meeting with yourself" if you're having a difficult time finding the time to complete your own tasks.<BR>



<BR>



<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> 8. The more people invited to the meeting the better the outcome will be because more people will be informed at the same time.<BR>



<BR>



<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> 9. At any meeting you attend, you have the right to demand a competent leader even if that means taking over the meeting yourself.<BR>



<BR>



<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> 10. Monday morning, bright and early, is the best time for a meeting because everyone is refreshed from the weekend break.<BR>



<BR>



<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> 11. A meeting agenda isn't necessary unless the leader needs it.<BR>



<BR>



<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> 12. Meetings must begin without any social conversations beforehand.<BR>



<BR><BR>Answers: <BR>
<BR>


<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> 1. False. If meetings are held regularly, they could become stale. It's better to call meetings on an "as-needed" basis.<BR>



<BR>


<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> 2. False. Body language is immensely valuable in the meeting atmosphere. Nonverbal communications such as raised eyebrows, nods and notebooks closing signal distinct messages.<BR>



<BR>



<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> 3. False. Conference calls, video conferences and computer conferences are becoming valuable in replacing the cost in money and time of having in-person meetings. Yet, face-to-face meetings are still needed in some instances.<BR>



<BR>



<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> 4. False. Your colleagues should understand that whoever you send is totally competent of representing you. And, your employees should jump at the chance to learn and grow by attending meetings for you.<BR>




<BR>


<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> 5. True. When you have meetings back-to-back and crammed into one morning, you have a viable reason to end each meeting on time  to get to your next meeting.<BR>




<BR>


<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> 6. True. Open-ended meetings tend to stay unfocused. Ideally, each item to be discussed in the meeting should have an allotted time frame. When the time is up, the leader should summarize and move to the next topic or end the meeting.<BR>




<BR>


<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> 7. True. Scheduling this "meeting" into your daily plan allows you an excuse to say "No" to the requests of others for your time  you have a meeting to attend.<BR>




<BR>


<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> 8. False. More effort must be exerted to lead a meeting with each person added to its attendance. Keeping a multitude of people focused is often impossible. If you desire nothing more than to share information and don't want any give-and-take, a large meeting is probably okay.<BR>




<BR>


<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> 9. True. Unless you're part of the upper level of leaders in your organization, this may be difficult for you to accomplish but you can do your part to keep the meeting focused on its intent. When meeting with peers, go ahead and take control yourself if the meeting is going nowhere.<BR>




<BR>


<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> 10. False. Mondays and Fridays are the worst meeting days. On Mondays, everyone needs time to plan for the week and read the weekend's mail. On Fridays, people are winding down for the weekend. Wednesday mornings are the best times for meetings because everyone will be in their "work mode" and in high gear.<BR>




<BR>


<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> 11. False. An agenda should be the cornerstone of every meeting. Ideally, it should be completed and given to meeting attendees a few days before the meeting.<BR>




<BR>


<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> 12. False. Social talk tends to "soften" the atmosphere. Keep the conversation to a minimum and start the meeting on time.<BR>

<h2 ALIGN=center>Motivating Employees To Change Behavior</h2>



As a leader and manager, one of your primary responsibilities is to get your employees to produce desirable results through specific behaviors. To do this, many times you have to get them to actually change their behavior patterns. The key principle to understand in changing employees' behavior is that you can't change it for them; they must change it themselves. <p>



<BR>






With that principle in mind, the following is how to motivate employees to change their behavior:<p>







<ul>



<BR>


I. Identify the Desired Behavior You Want the Employee to Have <BR>





<BR>


To help you identify the desired behavior, apply these principles:<BR>





<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> A. Behavior is something the employee does. Attitudes and feelings aren't behavior.<BR>







<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> B. The outcome or result of the behavior must be positive and help you and the employee reach your goals. The behavior must also be meaningful to the employee. <BR>







<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> C. The behavior must be specific and easy to understand. For example, scheduling interviews, closing sales, calculating cash receipts, etc.<BR>







<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> D. The behavior must be easy to measure accurately.<BR>


<BR>





II. Communicate the Behavior You Want and Be Sure the Employee Understands What You Expect in Terms of: <BR>






<BR>


<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> A. The specific behavior you want.<BR>







<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> B. The benefits of mastering the behavior.<BR>







<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> C. The consequences of not executing the behavior.<BR>





<BR>


III. Keep Score<BR>




<BR>


<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> A. Score keeping must be seen as helpful and positive.<BR>







<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> B. Accurate score keeping motivates people to do better. Personal biases of management are removed. Results are rewarded.<BR>







<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> C. Score keeping can make work fun.<BR>





<BR>


IV. Evaluate the Results of Keeping Score<BR>




<BR>


<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> A. How did the employee do in mastering the behavior?


<BR>







<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> B. What went well?<BR>







<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> C. What went wrong? How can it be corrected?<BR>






<BR>


V. Dealing With the Consequences<BR>



<BR>


<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> A. Reinforce the desired behavior. With reinforcement, the employee will adopt the new behavior. Without it, the past behavior will return.<BR>







<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> B. In the absence of a positive and/or negative reinforcement, you will get behavior at a level just above the point of punishment or the minimum acceptable.<BR>







<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> C. When negative behavior is exhibited by an employee: 1. Give a warning and explain in depth the new behavior you expect; 2. Give frequent feedback on the spot. Don't wait! Don't store up criticisms; 3. Be sure the feedback you give is appropriate.<BR>






<BR>


VI. Encourage Positive Productive Behaviors<BR>


<BR>





Form the habit of complimenting your employees for their accomplishments to reinforce the desirable behavior. Even though an inept employee behaves as you want about 80 percent of the time, most managers tend to reinforce behavior in the opposite ratio. They typically give four reprimands or criticisms for each compliment. <BR>






<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> A. Use intrinsic (internal) rewards as opposed to extrinsic (external) rewards.<BR>







<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> B. Give positive "strokes" for positive behavior quickly and often. Give strokes honestly and unconditionally. Don't give them and take them away by adding comments such as "that was great, but I know you can do better."<BR>







<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> C. Don't penalize the employee you're rewarding by adding work to their jobs unless you're certain they want added responsibilities and duties.<BR>








<BR>


VII. Evaluate and Adjust<BR>


<BR>





Evaluate the results of the behavior. Did you and the employee succeed in reaching goals? Where do you go from here? In motivating you employees to change their behavior, one of the key criterions is that you and the employee both agree that the behavior needs to be changed and that both know exactly what the desirable behavior is. By having this clear understanding, you're both able to continuously monitor and observe the actual behavior. This allows you to deal with it immediately and make the proper adjustments. What most employees tend to do is "keep the water muddy" by not having this clear understanding with their managers. To effectively help employees change their behavior, clear understanding and accountability is an absolute must. <BR>





<BR>


Use these principles to get the most out of yourself and your people. <BR>

<h2 ALIGN=center> Keeping Your Cool In a Heat Wave</h2>
Many people enjoy the warmth and sunshine of long summer days. However, many of these same people overdo activities and suffer heat cramps, heat exhaustion, and life-threatening heat strokes. <p>
<BR>

According to the American Red Cross, heat can affect anyone. The key is to know how to prevent emergencies from occurring in the first place. Consider these heat wave safety tips:<p>

<ul>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif">Slow down. Avoid strenuous activities outside between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. If you must do strenuous activities, do them during the coolest part of the day, which is usually in the morning between 4 a.m. and 7 a.m.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif">Stay inside. Air conditioning keeps you cool. If air conditioning isn't available, stay on the lowest level of the house, out of the sunshine. Electric, or ceiling, fans can help sweat evaporate, which cools your body. <BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Dress lightly. Wear lightweight, light-colored clothing. Light colors will reflect away some of the sun's energy.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif">Drink water. Nothing satisfies thirst better than water. Drink plenty of water, even if you don't feel thirsty. Avoid drinks with alcohol or caffeine in them. They can make you feel good briefly, but make the heat's effect on your body worse. This is especially true of beer, which  actually dehydrates the body.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Eat small meals, more often. Choose lighter foods and fewer proteins, which increase metabolic heat. Avoid using salt tablets unless directed to do so by your doctor.<BR>
<BR>
If you exercise outdoors, follow these safety rules:<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Build up resistance to the heat slowly. Know your limits and slow down when you tire.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Exercise early in the morning or late in the evening.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Carry a water bottle. Drink a few ounces every 15 minutes and try squirting some water on your body to cool off.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Stay in the shade. For example, pick a jogging or biking route through a shaded area.<BR>
<BR><IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Stop if you begin to feel woozy. Go inside and drink water. Call for help if the feeling doesn't subside.<BR>
<BR>

</ul>

<h2 ALIGN=center>Heart Disease: A Preventable Disaster</h2>
If a natural disaster wiped out a million North Americans, the whole world would panic. But that many people die each year from the personal disaster of heart disease. <p>
<BR>

To reduce your risk of heart disease, apply these suggestions:<p>

<ul>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif">Control your blood pressure. High blood pressure causes constant high-pressured pumping which can wear out the heart and blood vessels. Cut salt in your diet and increase your potassium and calcium intake. Eat bananas, potatoes and low-fat dairy products, like yogurt and skim milk, which have potassium and calcium.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif">Shed extra pounds. Risk rises as weight goes up. But don't be the victim of the latest fad diets. Lose weight gradually by eating a low-fat, low-cholesterol, high-fiber diet. <BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif">Avoid excessive alcohol. Drinking weakens kidneys and stiffens the arteries. Studies show that people who have three or more drinks a day have higher blood pressure than those who drink less.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif">Control stress. Suppressing anger, anxiety and other emotions tightens blood vessel walls and increases the heart's output. Reduce stress with these activities: deep breathing, exercise, volunteer work, gardening, prayer, talking with friends, playing with a pet, or any other activity that relaxes you. Seek help - talk to a friend or counselor, or join a support group.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif">Snuff out cigarettes. Tobacco products contribute to high blood pressure and increase your risk of heart disease. Talk to your doctor about how to stop your smoking habit.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif">Eat fish. Fish contain heart-saving omega-3 fatty acids, which help cut cholesterol. Some of the best types of fish to eat are salmon, mackerel, sardines, trout and haddock.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif">Munch on apples. Apples contain pectin, a soluble fiber which helps reduce your cholesterol level.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif">Exercise regularly. Exercise can break down plaque and send it to the liver for disposal. Exercise at least three times a week for 30 minutes. But avoid jumping into a fitness program. Start slowly and work up.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif">Get checked regularly. Have your blood pressure, cholesterol level, weight and general health monitored regularly by your doctor.<BR>
<BR>
For more information, contact your local American Heart Association or call 1-800-242-8721.
</ul>
<center><IMG src="graphics/purpline.gif"></CENTER>
<h2 ALIGN=center>Analyzing Risk of Early Heart Attack</h2>

The fatal heart attack of the 28-year-old Russian skater Sergei Grinkov is an example of how heart disease can strike in an instant without warning. However, Grinkov had a high cholesterol reading, high blood pressure and a family history of heart disease.<p>

For most people under age 44, the risk of heart attack is small. But for people with a family history of heart disease and high blood pressure, statistics are less than comforting. Smoking, being overweight, or having diabetes can also increase risk.<p>

Does your present lifestyle predestine you to heart disease? Check the statements below that describe your lifestyle:<p>

<ul>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif">Your blood pressure is checked regularly.<BR>
<BR><IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif">You exercise at least 30 minutes, three times a week.<BR>
<BR><IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif">Your weight is within your recommended amount.<BR>
<BR><IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif">You don't smoke and try to avoid secondhand smoke.<BR>
<BR><IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif">You eat a balanced diet and limit your intake of saturated fat and cholesterol.<BR>
<BR>If you checked less than five, set new goals and strive to lead a more healthy lifestyle.

<h2 ALIGN=center>Work Out Your Wintertime Blues</h2>
When old man winter blows into town, will you stay inside or will you venture outside and continue your outdoor workout as usual? 
Cold weather doesn't have to mean an end to outdoor exercising. Many people find running, cycling, skiing, or walking outdoors in the winter a good way to avoid the wintertime blues. To continue exercising outside, simply make allowances for the weather and adjust your workout appropriately. <p>
<BR>

Here are suggestions to help you continue to have an exhilarating outdoor workout, despite the cold:<p>

<ul>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif">Warm up inside. Jog in place and stretch all of your major muscle groups inside before going outside.<BR>

<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif">Drink plenty of fluids. In colder weather, your body has the added responsibility of warming and moistening the cold air you breathe. Drink water before, during and after your workouts. Avoid alcohol and caffeinated drinks since both can dehydrate your body. Alcohol may also give a false sense of warmth. <BR>

<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif">Withstand the wind chill. The wind chill can drop temperatures drastically. To lessen the wind's effect, move against it at the beginning of your workout and keep it behind you as you finish your workout. This allows you to get the worst over at the onset before you become tired.<BR>

<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif">Be reflective. In the winter, daylight hours are shorter and vision ranges are distorted by weather conditions. Wear reflective clothing that will stand out against your surroundings.<BR>

<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif">Move constantly. If you have to stop exercising while outside, put on extra clothing before you get cold. Try to stay in constant motion while you're outside in the winter cold.<BR>

<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif">Be cautious. Exercising on snow or ice isn't worth risking your health. If you exercise through snow, slow your pace and wear shoes with good traction. Avoid exercising on wet ice or snow. Exercise indoors if weather conditions are extremely harsh.<BR>

<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif">Protect your skin and sight. Wear sunglasses and sunscreen when outside. Snow cover reflects sunlight which burns skin quickly and can hinder your vision.<BR>

<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif">Cool down inside. Jog in place and stretch your major muscle groups once inside again to cool down.
</ul>
<center><IMG src="graphics/purpline.gif"></CENTER>

<h2 ALIGN=center>Suit Up for Safe Winter Exercising</h2>

Journeying out for a jog in cold weather takes preparation to keep yourself warm. When preparing for outdoor exercise, consider the following tips:<p>

<ul>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif">Layer your clothes. The first layer should remove perspiration, the second layer should supply warmth, and the third layer should protect against wind and rain.<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif">Wear jackets with zippers so you can unzip them when you begin to sweat or remove them as you warm up.<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif">Wear thin socks that repel water away from your feet underneath thick wool socks for warmth.<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif">Stay on your feet. Choose shoes that have good traction and shock absorption for the surface you'll be exercising on. Wear shoes big enough to fit an extra pair of socks in without cramping your feet.<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif">Cover your head. Most of the heat your body loses escapes through your head. Wear a cap, hat, hood, ski mask, or scarf to prevent heat loss.<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif">Wear either mittens or gloves to warm your hands. Make sure your choice is waterproof.
</ul>

History proves that long-term investing is the key to financial success.
Our education and research programs help you identify superior stocks and
mutual funds consistent with your investing style and tolerance for risk.

Each issue of the educational Investors Alliance Investor Journal features
in-depth research articles, timely investment news, and guidance from
professionals all aimed at improving your investment results.  You profit
by learning firsthand what the investment experts are doing now.  We
regularly interview mutual fund managers and alert you to new
opportunities, helping you select investments that promise substantial
return at relatively moderate risk.  Our four and five diamond fund
directory lists the top mutual funds with the best risk-adjusted returns.
Spotlight Stocks highlights emerging profit opportunities that
institutions have overlooked.  When the giant institutions subsequently
move into these investments, your profits can soar.  The monthly stock
screens focus on undervalued stocks and mutual funds that sell below
intrinsic value as determined by a sophisticated series of quantitative
computer models. The Investors Alliance Investor Journal gives you new
insight into investment opportunities judged to be outstanding by market
experts.</font>

<center><p><font SIZE=+4>A Two-Pronged Attack on Air Pollutants</font></p></center>

<center><p><img src="golfguy.gif" border=4 height=291 width=178></p></center>

<p><img src="earth1.gif" border=0 height=33 width=33><font SIZE=+1>Air
pollution (indoor or outdoor) can be broken down into two categories:&nbsp;<b>gaseous</b>
pollution (e.g., ethylene, butane, aerosols, alcohols, and other organic
compounds that are the bases of most indoor odors) and <b>particulate</b>
pollution (e.g., dust, asbestos, fiberglass, powders, etc.). The natural
production of ions and ozone in the &quot;great outdoors&quot; automatically
controls both of these types of pollutants in natural environments.</font></p>

<p><img src="earth1.gif" border=0 height=33 width=33><font SIZE=+1><b>Ions</b>
are molecules that carry a charge of electricity. Ions are typically found
in the outdoors at a ratio of 4 negative ions to 3 positive ions. <b><i>Indoors</i></b>,
there are very few ions and the balance is mostly positive ions. When adding
negative ions to an environment, airborne particles take on an electronic
charge and become attracted to oppositely charged particles. Consequently,
airborne particles will either: a) fall out of the air due to the gravitational
pull on their accumulated weight, or b) be attracted to 'grounded' objects
(similar to the attraction of lightning to the earth). Either way, the
particles are taken out of your breathing space.</font></p>

<p><img src="earth1.gif" border=0 height=33 width=33><font SIZE=+1><b>Ozone</b>
is three atoms of oxygen combined. It is extremely reactive with hundreds
of gaseous organic compounds. Ozone breaks the majority of these compounds
into harmless/odorless carbon dioxide and water vapor. This process is
called &quot;oxidation&quot;, and is probably second only to fire in its
effectiveness at neutralizing volatile organic substances.</font></p>

<p><img src="earth1.gif" border=0 height=33 width=33><font SIZE=+1>Aero<b></b>Pure
purifiers (except for the Decon {ozone only} and Ion-15 {ions only} models)
emit <b>both</b> negative ions and low levels of ozone. They generate a
4-to-3 negative-to-positive ion ratio approximating the levels found naturally
outdoors; and the level of ozone produced is fully adjustable so that you
can tailor its output to your particular needs. Negative ions and ozone
together are what make Aero<b></b>Pure purifiers a &quot;two-pronged attack&quot;
on indoor air pollution.</font></p>

<h2 align=center>Biological Pollutants in Your Home </h2>

<p>Prepared by: 
<br><b>CPSC</b> and 
<br><b>American Lung Association</b> <i>The Christmas Seal People</i> </p>

<p>
<hr></p>

<p>This booklet will help you understand 1) what indoor biological pollution
is, 2) whether your home or lifestyle promotes its development, and 3)
how to control its growth and buildup. </p>

<p>Outdoor air pollution in cities is a major health problem. Much effort
and money continues to be spent cleaning up pollution in the outdoor air.
But air pollution can be a problem where you least expect it, in the place
you may have thought was safest--your home. Many ordinary activities such
as cooking, heating, cooling, cleaning, and redecorating can cause the
release and spread of indoor pollutants at home. Studies have shown that
the air in our homes can be even more polluted than outdoor air. </p>

<p>Many Americans spend up to 90 percent of their time indoors, often at
home. Therefore, breathing clean indoor air can have an important impact
on health. People who are inside a great deal may be at greater risk of
developing health problems, or having problems made worse by indoor air
pollutants. These people include infants, young children, the elderly,
and those with chronic illnesses. </p>

<h3>What Are Biological Pollutants?</h3>

<p>Biological pollutants are or were living organisms. They promote poor
indoor air quality and may be a major cause of days lost from work or school,
and of doctor and hospital visits. Some can even damage surfaces inside
and outside your house. Biological pollutants can travel through the air
and are often invisible. </p>

<p>Some common indoor biological pollutants are: </p>

<ul>
<li>Animal Dander (minute scales from hair, feathers, or skin) </li>

<li>Dust Mite and Cockroach parts </li>

<li>Fungi (Molds) </li>

<li>Infectious agents (bacteria or viruses) </li>

<li>Pollen </li>
</ul>

<p>Some of these substances are in every home. It is impossible to get
rid of them all. Even a spotless home may permit the growth of biological
pollutants. Two conditions are essential to support biological growth:
nutrients and moisture. These conditions can be found in many locations,
such as bathrooms, damp or flooded basements, wet appliances (such as humidifiers
or air conditioners), and even some carpets and furniture. </p>

<p>Modern materials and construction techniques may reduce the amount of
outside air brought into buildings which may result in high moisture levels
inside. Using humidifiers, unvented heaters, and air conditioners in our
homes has increased the chances of moisture forming on interior surfaces.
This encourages the growth of certain biological pollutants. </p>

<h3>The Scope Of The Problem</h3>

<p>Most information about sources and health effects of biological pollutants
is based on studies of large office buildings and two surveys of homes
in northern U.S. and Canada. These surveys show that 30% to 50% of all
structures have damp conditions which may encourage the growth and buildup
of biological pollutants. This percentage is likely to be higher in warm,
moist climates. </p>

<p>Some diseases or illnesses have been linked with biological pollutants
in the indoor environment. However, many of them also have causes unrelated
to the indoor environment. Therefore, we do not know how many health problems
relate only to poor indoor air. </p>

<h3>Health Effects Of Biological Pollutants</h3>

<p>All of us are exposed to biological pollutants. However, the effects
on our health depend upon the type and amount of biological pollution and
the individual person. Some people do not experience health reactions from
certain biological pollutants, while others may experience one or more
of the following reactions: </p>

<ul>
<li>Allergic </li>

<li>Infectious </li>

<li>Toxic </li>
</ul>

<p>Except for the spread of infections indoors, <b>ALLERGIC REACTIONS</b>
may be the most common health problem with indoor air quality in homes.
They are often connected with animal dander (mostly from cats and dogs),
with house dust mites (microscopic animals living in household dust), and
with pollen. Allergic reactions can range from mildly uncomfortable to
life-threatening, as in a severe asthma attack. Some common signs and symptoms
are: </p>

<ul>
<li>Watery eyes </li>

<li>Runny nose and sneezing </li>

<li>Nasal congestion </li>

<li>Itching </li>

<li>Coughing </li>

<li>Wheezing and difficulty breathing </li>

<li>Headache </li>

<li>Fatigue </li>
</ul>

<p>Health experts are especially concerned about people with asthma. These
people have very sensitive airways that can react to various irritants,
making breathing difficult. The number of people who have asthma has greatly
increased in recent years. The number of people with asthma has gone up
by 59 percent since 1970, to a total of 9.6 million people. Asthma in children
under 15 years of age has increased 41 percent in the same period, to a
total of 2.6 million children. The number of deaths from asthma is up by
68 percent since 1979, to a total of almost 4,400 deaths per year. </p>

<p><b>INFECTIOUS DISEASES</b> caused by bacteria and viruses, such as flu,
measles, chicken pox, and tuberculosis, may be spread indoors. Most infectious
diseases pass from person to person through physical contact. Crowded conditions
with poor air circulation can promote this spread. Some bacteria and viruses
thrive in buildings and circulate through indoor ventilation systems. For
example, the bacterium causing Legionnaire's disease, a serious and sometimes
lethal infection, and Pontiac Fever, a flu-like illness, have circulated
in some large buildings. </p>

<h3>Talking To Your Doctor </h3>

<p>Are you concerned about the effects on your health that may be related
to biological pollutants in your home? Before you discuss your concerns
with your doctor, you should know the answers to the following questions.
This information can help the doctor determine whether your health problems
may be related to biological pollution. </p>

<ul>
<li>Does anyone in the family have frequent headaches, fevers, itchy watery
eyes, a stuffy nose, dry throat, or a cough? Does anyone complain of feeling
tired or dizzy all the time? Is anyone wheezing or having difficulties
breathing on a regular basis? </li>

<li>Did these symptoms appear after you moved to a new or different home?
</li>

<li>Do the symptoms disappear when you go to school or the office or go
away on a trip, and return when you come back? </li>

<li>Have you recently remodelled your home or done any energy conservation
work, such as installing insulation, storm windows, or weather stripping?
Did your symptoms occur during or after these activities? </li>

<li>Does your home feel humid? Can you see moisture on the windows or on
other surfaces, such as walls and ceilings? </li>

<li>What is the usual temperature in your home? Is it very hot or cold?
</li>

<li>Have you recently had water damage? </li>

<li>Is your basement wet or damp? </li>

<li>Is there any obvious mold or mildew? </li>

<li>Does any part of your home have a musty or moldy odor? </li>

<li>Is the air stale? </li>

<li>Do you have pets? </li>

<li>Do your house plants show signs of mold? </li>

<li>Do you have air conditioners or humidifiers that have not been properly
cleaned? </li>

<li>Does your home have cockroaches or rodents? </li>
</ul>

<p><b>TOXIC REACTIONS</b> are the least studied and understood health problem
caused by some biological air pollutants in the home. Toxins can damage
a variety of organs and tissues in the body, including the liver, the central
nervous system, the digestive tract, and the immune system. </p>

<h3>Coping With the Problem</h3>

<p><b>Checking Your Home</b> </p>

<p>There is no simple and cheap way to sample the air in your home to determine
the level of all biological pollutants. Experts suggest that sampling for
biological pollutants is not a useful problem-solving tool. Even if you
had your home tested, it is almost impossible to know which biological
pollutant(s) cause various symptoms or health problems. The amount of most
biological substances required to cause disease is unknown and varies from
one person to the next. </p>

<p>Does this make the problem sound hopeless? On the contrary, you can
take several simple, practical actions to help remove sources of biological
pollutants, to help get rid of pollutants, and to prevent their return.
</p>

<p><b>Self-Inspection: A Walk Through Your Home</b> </p>

<p>Begin by touring your household. Follow your nose, and use your eyes.
Two major factors help create conditions for biological pollutants to grow:
nutrients and constant moisture with poor air circulation. </p>

<ul>
<li>Dust and construction materials, such as wood, wallboard, and insulation,
contain nutrients that allow biological pollutants to grow. Firewood also
is a source of moisture, fungi, and bugs. </li>

<li>Appliances such as humidifiers, kerosene and gas heaters, and gas stoves
add moisture to the air. </li>

<li>A musty odor, moisture on hard surfaces, or even water stains, may
be caused by: </li>

<ul>
<li>Air-conditioning units </li>

<li>Basements, attics, and crawlspaces </li>

<li>Bathrooms </li>

<li>Carpets </li>

<li>Heating and air-conditioning ducts </li>

<li>Humidifiers and dehumidifiers </li>

<li>Refrigerator drip pans </li>
</ul>
</ul>

<p><b>What You Can Do About Biological Pollutants </b></p>

<p>Before you give away the family pet or move, there are less drastic
steps that can be taken to reduce potential problems. Properly cleaning
and maintaining your home can help reduce the problem and may avoid interrupting
your normal routine. People who have health problems such as asthma, or
are allergic, may need to do this and more. Discuss this with your doctor.
</p>

<p><b>Moisture Control</b> </p>

<p>Water in your home can come from many sources. Water can enter your
home by leaking or by seeping through basement floors. Showers or even
cooking can add moisture to the air in your home. The amount of moisture
that the air in your home can hold depends on the temperature of the air.
As the temperature goes down, the air is able to hold less moisture. This
is why, in cold weather, moisture condenses on cold surfaces (for example,
drops of water form on the inside of a window). This moisture can encourage
biological pollutants to grow. </p>

<p>There are many ways to control moisture in your home: </p>

<ul>
<li>Fix leaks and seepage. If water is entering the house from the outside,
your options range from simple landscaping to extensive excavation and
waterproofing. (The ground should slope away from the house.) Water in
the basement can result from the lack of gutters or a water flow toward
the house. Water leaks in pipes or around tubs and sinks can provide a
place for biological pollutants to grow. </li>

<li>Put a plastic cover over dirt in crawlspaces to prevent moisture from
coming in from the ground. Be sure crawlspaces are well-ventilated. </li>

<li>Use exhaust fans in bathrooms and kitchens to remove moisture to the
outside (not into the attic). Vent your clothes dryer to the outside. </li>

<li>Turn off certain appliances (such as humidifiers or kerosene heaters)
if you notice moisture on windows and other surfaces. </li>

<li>Use dehumidifiers and air conditioners, especially in hot, humid climates,
to reduce moisture in the air, but be sure that the appliances themselves
don't become sources of biological pollutants. </li>

<li>Raise the temperature of cold surfaces where moisture condenses. Use
insulation or storm windows. (A storm window installed on the inside works
better than one installed on the outside.) Open doors between rooms (especially
doors to closets which may be colder than the rooms) to increase circulation.
Circulation carries heat to the cold surfaces. Increase air circulation
by using fans and by moving furniture from wall corners to promote air
and heat circulation. Be sure that your house has a source of fresh air
and can expel excessive moisture from the home. </li>

<li>Pay special attention to carpet on concrete floors. Carpet can absorb
moisture and serve as a place for biological pollutants to grow. Use area
rugs which can be taken up and washed often. In certain climates, if carpet
is to be installed over a concrete floor, it may be necessary to use a
vapor barrier (plastic sheeting) over the concrete and cover that with
sub-flooring (insulation covered with plywood) to prevent a moisture problem.
</li>

<li>Moisture problems and their solutions differ from one climate to another.
The Northeast is cold and wet; the Southwest is hot and dry; the South
is hot and wet; and the Western Mountain states are cold and dry. All of
these regions can have moisture problems. For example, evaporative coolers
used in the Southwest can encourage the growth of biological pollutants.
In other hot regions, the use of air conditioners which cool the air too
quickly may prevent the air conditioners from running long enough to remove
excess moisture from the air. The types of construction and weatherization
for the different climates can lead to different problems and solutions.
</li>
</ul>

<p>Maintain And Clean AU Appliances That Come In Contact With Water </p>

<ul>
<li>Have major appliances, such as furnaces, heat pumps and central air
conditioners, inspected and cleaned regularly by a professional, especially
before seasonal use. Change filters on heating and cooling systems according
to manufacturer's directions. (In general, change filters monthly during
use.) When first turning on the heating or air conditioning at the start
of the season, consider leaving your home until it airs out. </li>

<li>Have window or wall air-conditioning units cleaned and serviced regularly
by a professional, especially before the cooling season. Air conditioners
can help reduce the entry of allergy-causing pollen. But they may also
become a source of biological pollutants if not properly maintained. Clean
the coils and incline the drain pans according to manufacturer's instructions,
so water cannot collect in pools. </li>

<li>Have furnace-attached humidifiers cleaned and serviced regularly by
a professional, especially before the heating season. </li>

<li>Follow manufacturer's instructions when using any type of humidifier.
Experts differ on the benefits of using humidifiers. If you do use a portable
humidifier (approximately 1 to 2 gallon tanks), be sure to empty its tank
every day and refill with distilled or demineralized water, or even fresh
tap water if the other types of water are unavailable. For larger portable
humidifiers, change the water as recommended by the manufacturer. Unplug
the appliance before cleaning. Every third day, clean all surfaces coming
in contact with water with a 3% solution of hydrogen peroxide, using a
brush to loosen deposits. Some manufacturers recommend using diluted household
bleach for cleaning and maintenance, generally in a solution of one-half
cup bleach to one gallon water. When using any household chemical, rinse
well to remove all traces of chemical before refilling humidifier. </li>

<li>Empty dehumidifiers daily and clean often. If possible, have the appliance
drip directly into a drain. Follow manufacturer's instructions for cleaning
and maintenance. Always disconnect the appliance before cleaning. </li>

<li>Clean refrigerator drip pans regularly according to manufacturer's
instructions. If refrigerator and freezer doors don't seal properly, moisture
may build up and mold can grow. Remove any mold on door gaskets and replace
faulty gaskets. </li>
</ul>

<p><b>Clean Surfaces</b> </p>

<ul>
<li>Clean mold surfaces, such as showers and kitchen counters. </li>

<li>Remove meld from walls, ceilings, floors, and panelling. Do not simply
cover mold with paint, stain, varnish, or a moisture-proof sealer, as it
may resurface. </li>

<li>Replace moldy shower curtains, or remove them and scrub well with a
household cleaner and rinse before rehanging them. </li>
</ul>

<p><b>Dust Control</b> </p>

<p>Controlling dust is very important for people who are allergic to animal
dander and mites. You cannot see mites, but you can either remove their
favorite breeding grounds or keep these areas dry and clean. Dust mites
can thrive in sofas, stuffed chairs, carpets, and bedding. Open shelves,
fabric wallpaper, knickknacks, and venetian blinds are also sources of
dust mites. Dust mites live deep in the carpet and are not removed by vacuuming.
Many doctors suggest that their mite-allergic patients use washable area
rugs rather than wall-to-wall carpet. </p>

<ul>
<li>Always wash bedding in hot water (at least 130 F) to kill dust mites.
Cold water won't do the job. Launder bedding at least every 7 to 10 days.
</li>

<li>Use synthetic or foam rubber mattress pads and pillows, and plastic
mattress covers if you are allergic. Do not use fuzzy wool blankets, feather
or wool-stuffed comforters, and feather pillows. </li>

<li>Clean rooms and closets well; dust and vacuum often to remove surface
dust. Vacuuming and other cleaning may not remove all animal dander, dust
mite material, and other biological pollutants. Some particles are so small
they can pass through vacuum bags and remain in the air. If you are allergic
to dust, wear a mask when vacuuming or dusting. People who are highly allergy-prone
should not perform these tasks. They may even need to leave the house when
someone else is cleaning </li>
</ul>

<p><b>Before You Move</b> </p>

<p>Protect yourself by inspecting your potential new home. If you identify
problems, have the landlord or seller correct them before you move in,
or even consider moving elsewhere. </p>

<ul>
<li>Have professionals check the heating and cooling system, including
humidifiers and vents. Have duct lining and insulation checked for growth.
</li>

<li>Check for exhaust fans in bathrooms and kitchens. If there are no vents,
do the kitchen and bathrooms have at least one window apiece? Does the
cooktop have a hood vented outside? Does the clothes dryer vent outside?
Are all vents to the outside of the building, not into attics or crawlspaces?
</li>

<li>Look for obvious mold growth throughout the house, including attics,
basements, and crawlspaces, and around the foundation. See if there are
many plants close to the house, particularly if they are damp and rotting.
They are a potential source of biological pollutants. Downspouts from roof
gutters should route water away from the building. </li>

<li>Look for stains on the walls, floor or carpet (including any carpet
over concrete floors) as evidence of previous flooding or moisture problems.
Is there moisture on windows and surfaces? Are there signs of leaks or
seepage in the basement? </li>

<li>Look for rotted building materials which may suggest moisture or water
damage. </li>

<li>If you or anyone else in the family has a pet allergy, ask if any pets
have lived in the home. </li>

<li>Examine the design of the building. Remember that in cold climates,
overhanging areas, rooms over unheated garages, and closets on outside
walls may be prone to problems with biological pollutants. </li>

<li>Look for signs of cockroaches. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Where Biological Pollutants May Be Found In The Home</h3>

<ol>
<li>Dirty air conditioners </li>

<li>Dirty humidifiers and/or dehumidifiers </li>

<li>Bathroom without vents or windows </li>

<li>Kitchen without vents or windows </li>

<li>Dirty refrigerator drip pans </li>

<li>Laundry room with unvented dryer </li>

</ol>

<h3>Warning!</h3>

<p><b>Carefully read instructions for use and any cautionary labeling on
cleaning products before beginning cleaning procedures. </b></p>

<ul>
<li>Do not mix any chemical products. Especially, never mix cleaners containing
bleach with any product (such as ammonia) which does not have instructions
for such mixing. When chemicals are combined, a dangerous gas can sometimes
be formed. </li>

<li>Household chemicals may cause burning or irritation to skin and eyes.
</li>

<li>Household chemicals may be harmful if swallowed, or inhaled. </li>

<li>Avoid contact with skin, eyes, mucous membranes and clothing </li>

<li>Avoid breathing vapor. Open all windows and doors and use an exhaust
fan that sends the air outside. </li>

<li>Keep household chemicals out of reach of children. </li>

<li>Rinse treated surface areas well to remove all traces of chemicals.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Correcting Water Damage</h3>

<p>What if damage is already done? Follow these guidelines for correcting
water damage: </p>

<ul>
<li>Throw out mattresses, wicker furniture, straw baskets and the like
that have been water damaged or contain mold. These cannot be recovered.
</li>

<li>Discard any water-damaged furnishings such as carpets, drapes, stuffed
toys, upholstered furniture and ceiling tiles, unless they can be recovered
by steam cleaning or hot water washing and thorough drying. </li>

<li>Remove and replace wet insulation to prevent conditions where biological
pollutants can grow. </li>
</ul>

<font SIZE=+2>INDOOR AIR QUALITY CONCERNS</font> 
<p>All of us face a variety of risks to our health as we go about our day-to-day
lives. Driving in cars, flying in planes, engaging in recreational activities,
and being exposed to environmental pollutants all pose varying degrees
of risk. Some risks are simply unavoidable. Some we choose to accept because
to do otherwise would restrict our ability to lead our lives the way we
want. And some are risks we might decide to avoid if we had the opportunity
to make informed choices. Indoor air pollution is one risk that you can
do something about.</p>

<p>In the last several years, a growing body of scientific evidence has
indicated that the air within homes and other buildings can be more seriously
polluted than the outdoor air in even the largest and most industrialized
cities. Other research indicates that people spend approximately 90 percent
of their time indoors. Thus, for many people, the risks to health may be
greater due to exposure to air pollution indoors than outdoors. In addition,
people who may be exposed to indoor air pollutants for the longest periods
of time are often those most susceptible to the effects of indoor air pollution.
Such groups include the young, the elderly, and the chronically ill, especially
those suffering from respiratory or cardiovascular disease.</p>

<p>
<hr width="100%" ></p>

<p>WHY A BOOKLET ON INDOOR AIR?</p>

<p>While pollutant levels from in-dividual sour-ces may not pose a significant
health risk by themselves, most homes have more than one source that contributes
to indoor air pollution. There can be a serious risk from the cumulative
effects of these sources. Fortunately, there are steps that most people
can take both to reduce the risk from existing sources and to prevent new
problems from occurring. This booklet was prepared by the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission
(CPSC) to help you decide whether to take actions that can reduce the level
of indoor air pollution in your own home. Because so many Americans spend
a lot of time in offices with mechanical heating, cooling, and ventilation
systems, there is also a short section on the causes of poor air quality
in offices and what you can do if you suspect that your office may have
a problem. A glossary and a list of organizations where you can get additional
information are listed at the back of this booklet.</p>

<p>WHAT CAUSES INDOOR AIR PROBLEMS?</p>

<p>Indoor pollution sources that release gases or particles into the air
are the primary cause of indoor air quality problems in homes. Inadequate
ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not bringing in enough
outdoor air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying
indoor air pollutants out of the home. High temperature and humidity levels
can also increase concentrations of some pollutants.</p>

<p>Pollutant Sources</p>

<p>There are many sources of indoor air pollution in any home. These include
combustion sources such as oil, gas, kerosene, coal, wood, and tobacco
products; building materials and furnishings as diverse as deteriorated,
asbestos-containing insulation, wet or damp carpet, and cabinetry or furniture
made of certain pressed wood products; products for household cleaning
and maintenance, personal care, or hobbies; central heating and cooling
systems and humidification devices; and outdoor sources such as radon,
pesticides, and outdoor air pollution. The relative importance of any single
source depends on how much of a given pollutant it emits and how hazardous
those emissions are. In some cases, factors such as how old the source
is and whether it is properly maintained are significant. For example,
an improperly adjusted gas stove can emit significantly more carbon monoxide
than one that is properly adjusted. Some sources, such as building materials,
furnishings, and household products like air fresh-eners, release pollutants
more or less continuously. Other sources, related to activities carried
out in the home, release pollutants intermittently. These include smoking,
the use of unvented or malfunctioning stoves, furnaces, or space heaters,
the use of solvents in cleaning and hobby activities, the use of paint
strippers in redecorating activities, and the use of cleaning products
and pesticides in house-keeping. High pollutant concentrations can remain
in the air for long periods after some of these activities.</p>

<p>Amount of Ventilation </p>

<p>If too little outdoor air enters a home, pollutants can accumulate to
levels that can pose health and comfort problems. Unless they are built
with special mechanical means of ventilation, homes that are designed and
constructed to minimize the amount of outdoor air that can leaky.</p>

<p>HOW DOES OUTDOOR AIR ENTER A HOUSE?</p>

<p>Outdoor air enters and leaves a house by: infiltration, natural ventilation,
and mechanical ventilation. In a process known as infiltration, outdoor
air flows into the house through openings, joints, and cracks in walls,
floors, and ceilings, and around windows and doors. In natural ventilation,
air moves through opened windows and doors. Air movement associated with
infiltration and natural ventilation is caused by air temperature differences
between indoors and outdoors and by wind. Finally, there are a number of
mechanical ventilation devices, from outdoor-vented fans that intermittently
remove air from a single room, such as bathrooms and kitchen, to air handling
systems that use fans and duct work to continuously remove indoor air and
distribute filtered and conditioned outdoor air to strategic points throughout
the house. The rate at which outdoor air replaces indoor air is described
as the air exchange rate. When there is little infiltration, natural ventilation,
or mechanical ventilation, the air exchange rate is low and pollutant levels
can increase.</p>

<p>WHAT IF YOU LIVE IN AN APARTMENT?</p>

<p>Apartments can have the same indoor air problems as single-family homes
because many of the pollution sources, such as the interior building materials,
furnishings, and household products, are similar. Indoor air problems similar
to those in offices are caused by such sources as contaminated ventilation
systems, improperly placed outdoor air intakes, or maintenance activities.
Solutions to air quality problems in apartments, as in homes and offices,
involve such actions as: eliminating or controlling the sources of pollution,
increasing ventilation, and installing air cleaning devices. Often a resident
can take the appropriate action to improve the indoor air quality by removing
a source, altering an activity, unblocking an air supply vent, or opening
a window to temporarily increase the ventilation; in other cases, however,
only the building owner or manager is in a position to remedy the problem.
(See the section &quot;What to Do If You Suspect a Problem&quot; on page
30.) You can encourage building management to follow guidance in EPA and
NIOSH's Building Air Quality: A Guide for Building Owners and Facility
Managers. It is available for $24 from the Superintendent of Documents,

<p>INDOOR AIR AND YOUR HEALTH</p>

<p>Health effects from indoor air pollutants may be experienced soon after
exposure or, possibly, years later. Immediate effects may show up after
a single exposure or repeated exposures. These include irritation of the
eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, dizziness, and fatigue. Such immediate
effects are usually short-term and treatable. Sometimes the treatment is
simply eliminating the person's exposure to the source of the pollution,
if it can be identified. Symptoms of some diseases, including asthma, hypersensitivity
pneumonitis, and humidifier fever, may also show up soon after exposure
to some indoor air pollutants. The likelihood of immediate reactions to
indoor air pollutants depends on several factors. Age and preexisting medical
conditions are two important influences. In other cases, whether a person
reacts to a pollutant depends on individual sensitivity, which varies tremendous-ly
from person to person. Some people can become sensitized to biological
pollutants after repeated exposures, and it appears that some people can
become sensitized to chemical pollutants as well. Certain immediate effects
are similar to those from colds or other viral diseases, so it is often
difficult to determine if the symptoms are a result of exposure to indoor
air pollution. For this reason, it is important to pay attention to the
time and place the symptoms occur. If the symptoms fade or go away when
a person is away from the home and return when the person returns, an effort
should be made to identify indoor air sources that may be possible causes.
Some effects may be made worse by an inadequate supply of outdoor air or
from the heating, cooling, or humidity conditions prevalent in the home.
Other health effects may show up either years after exposure has occurred
or only after long or repeated periods of exposure. These effects, which
include some respiratory diseases, heart disease, and cancer, can be severely
debilitating or fatal. It is prudent to try to improve the indoor air quality
in your home even if symptoms are not noticeable. More information on potential
health effects from particular indoor air pollutants is provided in the
section, &quot;A Look at Source-Specific Controls.&quot; While pollutants
commonly found in indoor air are responsible for many harmful effects,
there is considerable uncertainty about what concentrations or periods
of exposure are necessary to produce specific health problems. People also
react very differently to exposure to indoor air pollutants. Further research
is needed to better understand which health effects occur after exposure
to the average pollutant concentrations found in homes and which occur
from the higher concentrations that occur for short periods of time. The
health effects associated with some indoor air pollutants are summarized
in the chart in the middle of this booklet titled &quot;Reference Guide
to Major Indoor Air Pollutants in the Home.&quot; </p>

<p>IDENTIFYING AIR QUALITY PROBLEMS</p>

<p>Some health effects can be useful indicators of an indoor air quality
problem, especially if they appear after a person moves to a new residence,
remodels or refurnishes a home, or treats a home with pesticides. If you
think that you have symptoms that may be related to your home environment,
discuss them with your doctor or your local health department to see if
they could be caused by indoor air pollution. You may also want to consult
a board-certified allergist or an occupational medicine specialist for
answers to your questions. Another way to judge whether your home has or
could develop indoor air problems is to identify potential sources of indoor
air pollution. Although the presence of such sources (see illustration
at the beginning of this booklet) does not necessarily mean that you have
an indoor air quality problem, being aware of the type and number of potential
sources is an important step toward assessing the air quality in your home.
A third way to decide whether your home may have poor indoor air quality
is to look at your lifestyle and activities. Human activities can be significant
sources of indoor air pollution. Finally, look for signs of problems with
the ventilation in your home. Signs that can indicate your home may not
have enough ventilation include moisture condensation on windows or walls,
smelly or stuffy air, dirty central heating and air cooling equipment,
and areas where books, shoes, or other items become moldy. To detect odors
in your home, step outside for a few minutes, and then upon reentering
your home, note whether odors are noticeable.</p>

<p>MEASURING POLLUTANT LEVELS</p>

<p>T he federal government recommends that you measure the level of radon
in your home. Without measurements there is no way to tell whether radon
is present because it is a colorless, odorless, radioactive gas. Inexpensive
devices are available for measuring radon. EPA provides guidance as to
risks associated with different levels of exposure and when the public
should consider corrective action. There are specific mitigation techniques
that have proven effective in reducing levels of radon in the home. (See
&quot;Radon&quot; section on p. 11 of this booklet for additional information
about testing and controlling radon in homes.) For pollutants other than
radon, measurements are most appropriate when there are either health symptoms
or signs of poor ventilation and specific sources or pollutants have been
identified as possible causes of indoor air quality problems. Testing for
many pollutants can be expensive. Before monitoring your home for pollutants
besides radon, consult your state or local health department or professionals
who have experience in solving indoor air quality problems in nonindustrial
buildings.</p>

<p>WEATHERIZING YOUR HOME</p>

<p>The federal government recommends that homes be weatherized in order
to reduce the amount of energy needed for heating and cooling. While weatherization
is underway, however, steps should also be taken to minimize pollution
from sources inside the home. (See &quot;Improving the Air Quality in Your
Home&quot; for recommended actions.) In addition, residents should be alert
to the emergence of signs of inadequate ventilation, such as stuffy air,
moisture condensation on cold surfaces, or mold and mildew growth. Additional
weatherization measures should not be undertaken until these problems have
been corrected. Weatherization generally does not cause indoor air problems
by adding new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such
as caulking, that can sometimes emit pollutants.) However, measures such
as installing storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in
wall insulation can reduce the amount of outdoor air infiltrating into
a home. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air
pollutants from sources inside the home can increase. </p>

<p>
<hr width="100%" ></p>

<p>THREE BASIC STRATEGIES</p>

<p>1) Source Control</p>

<p>Usually the most effective way to improve indoor air quality is to eliminate
individual sources of pollution or to reduce their emissions. Some sources,
like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like
gas stoves, can be adjusted to decrease the amount of emissions. In many
cases, source control is also a more cost-efficient approach to protecting
indoor air quality than increasing ventilation because increasing ventilation
can increase energy costs. Specific sources of indoor air pollution in
your home are listed later in this section.</p>

<p>2) Ventilation Improvements</p>

<p>Another approach to lowering the concentrations of indoor air pollutants
in your home is to increase the amount of outdoor air coming indoors. Most
home heating and cooling systems, including forced air heating systems,
do not mechanically bring fresh air into the house. Opening windows and
doors, operating window or attic fans, when the weather permits, or running
a window air conditioner with the vent control open increases the outdoor
ventilation rate. Local bathroom or kitchen fans that exhaust outdoors
remove contaminants directly from the room where the fan is located and
also increase the outdoor air ventilation rate. It is particularly important
to take as many of these steps as possible while you are involved in short-term
activities that can generate high levels of pollutants--for example, painting,
paint stripping, heating with kerosene heaters, cooking, or engaging in
maintenance and hobby activities such as welding, soldering, or sanding.
You might also choose to do some of these activities outdoors, if you can
and if weather permits. Advanced designs of new homes are starting to feature
mechanical systems that bring outdoor air into the home. Some of these
designs include energy-efficient heat recovery ventilators (also known
as air-to-air heat exchangers). For more information about air-to-air heat
exchangers, contact the Conservation and Renewable Energy Inquiry and Referral
Service (CAREIRS), PO Box 3048, Merrifield, VA 22116; (800) 523-2929.</p>

<p>3) Air Cleaners</p>

<p>There are many types and sizes of air cleaners on the market, ranging
from relatively inexpensive table-top models to sophisticated and expensive
whole-house systems. Some air cleaners are highly effective at particle
removal, while others, including most table-top models, are much less so.
Air cleaners are generally not designed to remove gaseous pollutants. The
effectiveness of an air cleaner depends on how well it collects pollutants
from indoor air (expressed as a percentage efficiency rate) and how much
air it draws through the cleaning or filtering element (expressed in cubic
feet per minute). A very efficient collector with a low air-circulation
rate will not be effective, nor will a cleaner with a high air-circulation
rate but a less efficient collector. </p>

<p>The long-term performance of any air cleaner depends on maintaining
it according to the manufacturer's directions. Another important factor
in determining the effectiveness of an air cleaner is the strength of the
pollutant source. Table-top air cleaners, in particular, may not remove
satisfactory amounts of pollutants from strong nearby sources. People with
a sensitivity to particular sources may find that air cleaners are helpful
only in conjunction with concerted efforts to remove the source. </p>

<p>Over the past few years, there has been some publicity suggesting that
houseplants have been shown to reduce levels of some chemicals in laboratory
experiments. There is currently no evidence, however, that a reasonable
number of houseplants remove significant quantities of pollutants in homes
and offices. Indoor houseplants should not be over-watered because overly
damp soil may promote the growth of microorganisms which can affect allergic
individuals. </p>

<p>At present, EPA does not recommend using air cleaners to reduce levels
of <b>radon</b> and its decay products. The effectiveness of these devices
is uncertain because they only partially remove the radon decay products
and do not diminish the amount of radon entering the home. EPA plans to
do additional research on whether air cleaners are, or could become, a
reliable means of reducing the health risk from radon. EPA's booklet, Residential
Air-Cleaning Devices, provides further information on air-cleaning devices
to reduce indoor air pollutants. For most indoor air quality problems in
the home, source control is the most effective solution. This section takes
a source-by-source look at the most common indoor air pollutants, their
potential health effects, and ways to reduce levels in the home. (For a
summary of the points made in this section, see the chart in the middle
of this booklet titled &quot;Reference Guide to Major Indoor Air Pollutants
in the Home.&quot;)</p>

<p>
<hr width="100%" ></p>

<p>RADON</p>

<p>The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock
on which homes are built. As uran-ium naturally breaks down, it releases
radon gas which is a colorless, odorless, radioactive gas. Radon gas enters
homes through dirt floors, cracks in concrete walls and floors, floor drains,
and sumps. When radon be-comes trapped in buildings and concentrations
build up indoors, exposure to radon becomes a concern. Any home may have
a radon problem. This means new and old homes, well-sealed and drafty homes,
and homes with or without basements. Sometimes radon enters the home through
well water. In a small number of homes, the building materials can give
off radon, too. However, building materials rarely cause radon problems
by themselves.</p>

<p>Health Effects of Radon</p>

<p>The predominant health effect associated with exposure to elevated levels
of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high
radon levels may pose risks, too, although these are believed to be much
lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Major health organizations
(like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung
Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates
that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year.
EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths per year in the United
States--however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per
year. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your risk of lung
cancer is especially high. Reducing Exposure to Radon in Homes Measure
levels of radon in your home. You can't see radon, but it's not hard to
find out if you have a radon problem in your home. Testing is easy and
should only take a little of your time. There are many kinds of inexpensive,
do-it-yourself radon test kits you can get through the mail and in hardware
stores and other retail outlets. Make sure you buy a test kit that has
passed EPA's testing program or is state-certified. These kits will usually
display the phrase &quot;Meets EPA Requirements.&quot; If you prefer, or
if you are buying or selling a home, you can hire a trained contractor
to do the testing for you. The EPA Radon Measurement Proficiency (RMP)
Program evaluates testing contractors. A contractor who has met EPA's requirements
will carry a special RMP identification card. EPA provides a list of companies
and indivi-dual contractors to state radon offices. You can call your state
radon office to obtain a list of qualified contractors in your area (call
800-SOS RADON for a list of state radon offices). </p>

<p>1) Refer to the EPA guidelines on how to test and interpret your test
results.</p>

<p>You can learn more about radon through EPA's publications, A Citizen's
Guide to Radon: The Guide to Protecting Yourself and Your Family From Radon
and Home Buyer's and Seller's Guide to Radon, which are available from
state radon offices.</p>

<p>2) Learn about radon reduction methods.</p>

<p>Ways to reduce radon in your home are discussed in EPA's Consumer's
Guide to Radon Reduction. You can get a copy from your state radon office.
There are simple solutions to radon problems in homes. Thousands of homeowners
have already fixed radon problems. Lowering high radon levels requires
technical knowledge and special skills. You should use a contractor who
is trained to fix radon problems. The EPA Radon Contractor Proficiency
(RCP) Program tests these contractors. EPA provides a list of RCP contractors
to state radon offices. A contractor who is listed by EPA will carry a
special RCP identification card. A trained RCP contractor can study the
problem in your home and help you pick the correct treatment method. Check
with your state radon office for names of qualified or state-certified
radon-reduction contractors in your area. </p>

<p>3) Stop smoking and discourage smoking in your home.</p>

<p>Scientific evidence indicates that smoking combined with radon is an
especially serious health risk. Stop smoking and lower your radon level
to reduce lung cancer risk</p>

<p>4) Treat radon-contaminated well water.</p>

<p>While radon in water is not a problem in homes served by most public
water supplies, it has been found in well water. If you've tested the air
in your home and found a radon problem, and you have a well, contact a
lab certified to measure radiation in water to have your water tested.
Radon problems in water can be readily fixed. Call your state radon office
or the EPA Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) for more information.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENTAL TOBACCO SMOKE</p>

<p>Environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) is the mixture of smoke that comes
from the burning end of a cigarette, pipe, or cigar, and smoke exhaled
by the smoker. It is a complex mixture of over 4,000 compounds, more than
40 of which are known to cause cancer in humans or animals and many of
which are strong irritants. ETS is often referred to as &quot;secondhand
smoke&quot; and exposure to ETS is often called &quot;passive smoking.&quot;
</p>

<p>Health Effects of Environmental Tobacco Smoke</p>

<p>In 1992, EPA completed a major assessment of the respiratory health
risks of ETS (Respiratory Health Effects of Passive Smoking: Lung Cancer
and Other Disorders EPA/600/6-90/006F). The report concludes that exposure
to ETS is responsible for approximately 3,000 lung cancer deaths each year
in nonsmoking adults and impairs the respiratory health of hundreds of
thousands of children. Infants and young children whose parents smoke in
their presence are at increased risk of lower respiratory tract infections
(pneumonia and bronchitis) and are more likely to have symptoms of respiratory
irritation like cough, excess phlegm, and wheeze. EPA estimates that passive
smoking annually causes between 150,000 and 300,000 lower respiratory tract
infections in infants and children under 18 months of age, resulting in
between 7,500 and 15,000 hospitalizations each year. These children may
also have a build-up of fluid in the middle ear, which can lead to ear
infections. Older children who have been exposed to secondhand smoke may
have slightly reduced lung function. Asthmatic children are especially
at risk. EPA estimates that exposure to secondhand smoke increases the
number of episodes and severity of symptoms in hundreds of thousands of
asthmatic children, and may cause thousands of nonasth-matic children to
develop the disease each year. EPA estimates that between 200,000 and 1,000,000
asthmatic children have their condition made worse by exposure to secondhand
smoke each year. Exposure to secondhand smoke causes eye, nose, and throat
irritation. It may affect the cardiovascular system and some studies have
linked exposure to secondhand smoke with the onset of chest pain. For publications
about ETS, contact EPA's Indoor Air Quality Information Clearinghouse (IAQ
INFO), 800-438-4318 or (202) 484-1307.</p>

<p>Reducing Exposure to Environmental Tobacco Smoke</p>

<p>1) Don't smoke at home or permit others to do so.</p>

<p>Ask smokers to smoke outdoors. The 1986 Surgeon General's report concluded
that physical separation of smokers and nonsmokers in a common air space,
such as different rooms within the same house, may reduce_but will not
eliminate_non-smokers' exposure to environmental tobacco smoke.</p>

<p>2) If smoking indoors cannot be avoided, increase ventilation in the
area where smoking takes place. </p>

<p>Open windows or use exhaust fans. Ventilation, a common method of reducing
exposure to indoor air pollutants, also will reduce but not eliminate exposure
to environmental tobacco smoke. Because smoking produces such large amounts
of pollutants, natural or mechanical ventilation techniques do not remove
them from the air in your home as quickly as they build up. In addition,
the large increases in ventilation it takes to significantly reduce exposure
to environmental tobacco smoke can also increase energy costs substantially.
Consequently, the most effective way to reduce exposure to environmental
tobacco smoke in the home is to eliminate smoking there. </p>

<p>3) Do not smoke if children are present, particularly infants and toddlers.</p>

<p>Children are particularly susceptible to the effects of passive smoking.
Do not allow baby-sitters or others who work in your home to smoke indoors.
Discourage others from smoking around children. Find out about the smoking
policies of the day care center providers, schools, and other care givers
for your children. The policy should protect children from exposure to
ETS.</p>

<p>BIOLOGICAL CONTAMINANTS</p>

<p>Biological contaminants include bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal
dander and cat saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There
are many sources of these pollutants. Pollens originate from plants; viruses
are transmitted by people and animals; bacteria are carried by people,
animals, and soil and plant debris; and household pets are sources of saliva
and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent
allergen. When it dries, it can become airborne. Contaminated central air
handling systems can become breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other
sources of biological contaminants and can then distribute these contaminants
through the home. By controlling the relative humidity level in a home,
the growth of some sources of biologicals can be minimized. A relative
humidity of 30-50 percent is generally recommended for homes. Standing
water, water-damaged materials, or wet surfaces also serve as a breeding
ground for molds, mildews, bacteria, and insects. House dust mites, the
source of one of the most powerful biological allergens, grow in damp,
warm environments.</p>

<p>Health Effects From Biological Contaminants</p>

<p>Some biological contaminants trigger allergic reactions, including hypersensitivity
pneumonitis, allergic rhinitis, and some types of asthma. Infectious illnesses,
such as influenza, measles, and chicken pox are transmitted through the
air. Molds and mildews release disease-causing toxins. Symptoms of health
problems caused by biological pollutants include sneezing, watery eyes,
coughing, shortness of breath, dizziness, lethargy, fever, and digestive
problems. Allergic reactions occur only after repeated exposure to a specific
biological allergen. However, that reaction may occur immediately upon
re-exposure or after multiple exposures over time. As a result, people
who have noticed only mild allergic reactions, or no reactions at all,
may suddenly find themselves very sensitive to particular allergens. Some
diseases, like humidifier fever, are associated with exposure to toxins
from microorganisms that can grow in large building ventilation systems.
However, these diseases can also be traced to microorganisms that grow
in home heating and cooling systems and humidifiers. Children, elderly
people, and people with breathing problems, allergies, and lung diseases
are particularly susceptible to disease-causing biological agents in the
indoor air.</p>

<p>Reducing Exposure to Biological Contaminants</p>

<p>1) Install and use exhaust fans that are vented to the outdoors in kitchens
and bathrooms and vent clothes dryers outdoors.</p>

<p>These actions can eliminate much of the moisture that builds up from
everyday activities. There are exhaust fans on the market that produce
little noise, an important consideration for some people. Another benefit
to using kitchen and bathroom exhaust fans is that they can reduce levels
of organic pollutants that vaporize from hot water used in showers and
dishwashers.</p>

<p>2) Ventilate the attic and crawl spaces to prevent moisture build-up.</p>

<p>Keeping humidity levels in these areas below 50 percent can prevent
water condensation on building materials.</p>

<p>3) If using cool mist or ultrasonic humidifiers, clean appliances according
to manufacturer's instructions and refill with fresh water daily.</p>

<p>Because these humidifiers can become breeding grounds for biological
contaminants, they have the potential for causing diseases such as hypersensitivity
pneumonitis and humidifier fever. Evaporation trays in air conditioners,
dehumidifiers, and refrigera- tors should also be cleaned frequently.</p>

<p>4) Thoroughly clean and dry water-damaged carpets and building materials
(within 24 hours if possible) or consider removal and replacement.</p>

<p>Water-damaged carpets and building materials can harbor mold and bacteria.
It is very difficult to completely rid such materials of biological contaminants.</p>

<p>5) Keep the house clean.</p>

<p>House dust mites, pollens, animal dander, and other allergy-causing
agents can be reduced, although not eliminated, through regular cleaning.
People who are allergic to these pollutants should use allergen-proof mattress
encasements, wash bedding in hot (130_F) water, and avoid room furnishings
that accumulate dust, especially if they cannot be washed in hot water.
Allergic individuals should also leave the house while it is being vacuumed
because vacuuming can actually increase airborne levels of mite allergens
and other biological contaminants. Using central vacuum systems that are
vented to the outdoors or vacuums with high efficiency filters may also
be of help.</p>

<p>6) Take steps to minimize biological pollutants in basements.</p>

<p>Clean and disinfect the basement floor drain regularly. Do not finish
a basement below ground level unless all water leaks are patched and outdoor
ventilation and adequate heat to prevent condensation are provided. Operate
a dehumidifier in the basement if needed to keep relative humidity levels
between 30_50 percent. To learn more about biological pollutants, read
Biological Pollutants in Your Home issued by the U.S. Consumer Product
Safety Commission and the American Lung Assoc-iation. For contact information,
see the section, &quot;Where to Go For Additional Information.&quot;</p>

<p>STOVES, HEATERS, FIREPLACES, AND CHIMNEYS</p>

<p>In addition to environmental tobacco smoke, other sources of combustion
products are unvented kerosene and gas space heaters, woodstoves, fireplaces,
and gas stoves. The major pollutants released are carbon monoxide, nitrogen
dioxide, and particles. Unvented kerosene heaters may also generate acid
aerosols. Combustion gases and particles also come from chimneys and flues
that are improperly installed or maintained and cracked furnace heat exchangers.
Pollutants from fireplaces and woodstoves with no dedicated outdoor air
supply can be &quot;back-drafted&quot; from the chimney into the living
space, particularly in weatherized homes.</p>

<p>Health Effects of Combustion Products</p>

<p>Carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless gas that interferes with the
delivery of oxygen throughout the body. At high concentrations it can cause
unconsciousness and death. Lower concentrations can cause a range of symptoms
from headaches, dizziness, weakness, nausea, confusion, and disorientation,
to fatigue in healthy people and episodes of increased chest pain in people
with chronic heart disease. The symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning are
sometimes confused with the flu or food poisoning. Fetuses, infants, elderly
people, and people with anemia or with a history of heart or respiratory
disease can be especially sensitive to carbon monoxide exposures. Nitrogen
dioxide is a colorless, odorless gas that irritates the mucous membranes
in the eye, nose, and throat and causes shortness of breath after exposure
to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued
exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the risk of respiratory
infection; there is also evidence from animal studies that repeated exposures
to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the development
of lung disease such as emphysema. People at particular risk from exposure
to nitrogen dioxide include children and individuals with asthma and other
respiratory diseases. Particles, released when fuels are incompletely burned,
can lodge in the lungs and irritate or damage lung tissue. A number of
pollutants, including radon and benzo(a)py-rene, both of which can cause
cancer, attach to small particles that are inhaled and then carried deep
into the lung.</p>

<p>Reducing Exposure to Combustion Products in Homes</p>

<p>1) Take special precautions when operating fuel-burning unvented space
heaters. </p>

<p>Consider potential effects of indoor air pollution if you use an unvented
kerosene or gas space heater. Follow the manufacturer's directions, especially
instructions on the proper fuel and keeping the heater properly adjusted.
A persistent yellow-tipped flame is generally an indicator of maladjustment
and increased pollutant emissions. While a space heater is in use, open
a door from the room where the heater is located to the rest of the house
and open a window slightly. </p>

<p>2) Install and use exhaust fans over gas cooking stoves and ranges and
keep the burners properly adjusted.</p>

<p>Using a stove hood with a fan vented to the outdoors greatly reduces
exposure to pollutants during cooking. Improper adjustment, often indicated
by a persistent yellow-tipped flame, causes increased pollutant emissions.
Ask your gas company to adjust the burner so that the flame tip is blue.
If you purchase a new gas stove or range, consider buying one with pilotless
ignition because it does not have a pilot light that burns continuously.
Never use a gas stove to heat your home. Always make certain the flue in
your gas fireplace is open when the fireplace is in use.</p>

<p>3) Keep woodstove emissions to a minimum.</p>

<p>Choose properly sized new stoves that are certified as meeting EPA emission
standards. Make certain that doors in old woodstoves are tight-fitting.
Use aged or cured (dried) wood only and follow the manufacturer's directions
for starting, stoking, and putting out the fire in woodstoves. Chemicals
are used to pressure-treat wood; such wood should never be burned indoors.
(Because some old gaskets in woodstove doors contain asbestos, when replacing
gaskets refer to the instructions in the CPSC, ALA, and EPA booklet, Asbestos
in Your Home, to avoid creating an asbestos problem. New gaskets are made
of fiberglass.) </p>

<p>4) Have central air handling systems, including furnaces, flues, and
chimneys, inspected annually and promptly repair cracks or damaged parts.
</p>

<p>Blocked, leaking, or damaged chimneys or flues release harmful combustion
gases and particles and even fatal concentrations of carbon monoxide. Strictly
follow all service and maintenance procedures recommended by the manufacturer,
including those that tell you how frequently to change the filter. If manufacturer's
instructions are not readily available, change filters once every month
or two during periods of use. Proper maintenance is important even for
new furnaces because they can also corrode and leak combustion gases, including
carbon monoxide. Read the booklet What You Should Know About Combustion
Appliances and Indoor Air Pollution to learn more about combustion pollutants.
The booklet is available by contacting CPSC, EPA's IAQ INFO Clearinghouse,
or your local ALA. (See &quot;Where to Go for Additional Information&quot;
for contact information.) </p>

<p>HOUSEHOLD PRODUCTS</p>

<p>Organic chemicals are widely used as ingredients in household products.
Paints, varnishes, and wax all contain organic solvents, as do many cleaning,
disinfecting, cosmetic, degreasing, and hobby products. Fuels are made
up of organic chemicals. All of these products can release organic compounds
while you are using them, and, to some degree, when they are stored. EPA's
Total Exposure Assessment Methodology (TEAM) studies found levels of about
a dozen common organic pollutants to be 2 to 5 times higher inside homes
than outside, regardless of whether the homes were located in rural or
highly industrial areas. Additional TEAM studies indicate that while people
are using products containing organic chemicals, they can expose themselves
and others to very high pollutant levels, and elevated concentrations can
persist in the air long after the activity is completed.</p>

<p>Health Effects of Household Chemicals</p>

<p>The ability of organic chemicals to cause health effects varies greatly
from those that are highly toxic, to those with no known health effect.
As with other pollutants, the extent and nature of the health effect will
depend on many factors including level of exposure and length of time exposed.
Eye and respiratory tract irritation, headaches, dizziness, visual disorders,
and memory impairment are among the immediate symptoms that some people
have experienced soon after exposure to some organics. At present, not
much is known about what health effects occur from the levels of organics
usually found in homes. Many organic compounds are known to cause cancer
in animals; some are suspected of causing, or are known to cause, cancer
in humans. </p>

<p>Reducing Exposure to Household Chemicals </p>

<p>1) Follow label instructions carefully.</p>

<p>Potentially hazardous products often have warnings aimed at reducing
exposure of the user. For example, if a label says to use the product in
a well-ventilated area, go outdoors or in areas equipped with an exhaust
fan to use it. Otherwise, open up windows to provide the maximum amount
of outdoor air possible.</p>

<p>2) Throw away partially full containers of old or unneeded chemicals
safely. </p>

<p>Because gases can leak even from closed containers, this single step
could help lower concentrations of organic chemicals in your home. (Be
sure that materials you decide to keep are stored not only in a well-ventilated
area but are also safely out of reach of children.) Do not simply toss
these unwanted products in the garbage can. Find out if your local government
or any organization in your community sponsors special days for the collection
of toxic household wastes. If such days are available, use them to dispose
of the unwanted containers safely. If no such collection days are available,
think about organizing one.</p>

<p>3) Buy limited quantities.</p>

<p>If you use products only occasionally or seasonally, such as paints,
paint strippers, and kerosene for space heaters or gasoline for lawn mowers,
buy only as much as you will use right away.</p>

<p>4) Keep exposure to emissions from products containing methylene chloride
to a minimum.</p>

<p>Consumer products that contain methylene chloride include paint strippers,
adhesive removers, and aerosol spray paints. Methylene chloride is known
to cause cancer in animals. Also, methylene chloride is converted to carbon
monoxide in the body and can cause symptoms associated with exposure to
carbon monoxide. Carefully read the labels containing health hazard information
and cautions on the proper use of these products. Use products that contain
methylene chloride outdoors when possible; use indoors only if the area
is well ventilated.</p>

<p>5) Keep exposure to benzene to a minimum. </p>

<p>Benzene is a known human carcinogen. The main indoor sources of this
chemical are environmental tobacco smoke, stored fuels and paint supplies,
and automobile emissions in attached garages. Actions that will reduce
benzene exposure include eliminating smoking within the home, providing
for maximum ventilation during painting, and discarding paint supplies
and special fuels that will not be used immediately.</p>

<p>6) Keep exposure to perchloroethylene emissions from newly dry-cleaned
materials to a minimum. </p>

<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning.
In laboratory studies, it has been shown to cause cancer in animals. Recent
studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in
homes where dry-cleaned goods are stored and as they wear dry-cleaned clothing.
Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process
so they can save money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical
during the pressing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, however,
do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking
steps to minimize your exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned
goods have a strong chemical odor when you pick them up, do not accept
them until they have been properly dried. If goods with a chemical odor
are returned to you on subsequent visits, try a different dry cleaner.
</p>

<p>FORMALDEHYDE</p>

<p>Formaldehyde is an important chemical used widely by industry to manufacture
building materials and numerous household products. It is also a by-product
of combustion and certain other natural processes. Thus, it may be present
in substantial concentrations both indoors and outdoors. Sources of formaldehyde
in the home include building materials, smoking, household products, and
the use of unvented, fuel-burning appliances, like gas stoves or kerosene
space heaters. Formaldehyde, by itself or in combination with other chemicals,
serves a number of purposes in manufactured products. For example, it is
used to add permanent-press qualities to clothing and draperies, as a component
of glues and adhesives, and as a preservative in some paints and coating
products. In homes, the most significant sources of formaldehyde are likely
to be pressed wood products made using adhesives that contain urea-formaldehyde
(UF) resins. Pressed wood products made for indoor use include: particleboard
(used as subflooring and shelving and in cabinetry and furniture); hardwood
plywood paneling (used for decorative wall covering and used in cabinets
and furniture); and medium density fiberboard (used for drawer fronts,
cabinets, and furniture tops). Medium density fiberboard contains a higher
resin-to-wood ratio than any other UF pressed wood product and is generally
recognized as being the highest formaldehyde-emitting pressed wood product.
Other pressed wood products, such as softwood plywood and flake or oriented
strandboard, are produced for exterior construction use and contain the
dark, or red/black-colored phenol-formaldehyde (PF) resin. Although formaldehyde
is present in both types of resins, pressed woods that contain PF resin
generally emit formaldehyde at considerably lower rates than those containing
UF resin.</p>

<p>Since 1985, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has
permitted only the use of plywood and particleboard that conform to specified
formaldehyde emission limits in the construction of prefabricated and mobile
homes. In the past, some of these homes had elevated levels of formaldehyde
because of the large amount of high-emitting pressed wood products used
in their construction and because of their relatively small interior space.
The rate at which products like pressed wood or textiles release formaldehyde
can change. Formaldehyde emissions will generally decrease as products
age. When the products are new, high indoor temperatures or humidity can
cause increased release of formaldehyde from these products. During the
1970s, many homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed
in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation measure.
However, many of these homes were found to have relatively high indoor
concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few homes
are now being insulated with this product. Studies show that formaldehyde
emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was
installed many years ago are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde

<p>Health Effects of Formaldehyde</p>

<p>Formaldehyde, a colorless, pungent-smelling gas, can cause watery eyes,
burning sensations in the eyes and throat, nausea, and difficulty in breathing
in some humans exposed at elevated levels (above 0.1 parts per million).
High concentrations may trigger attacks in people with asthma. There is
evidence that some people can develop a sensitivity to formaldehyde. It
has also been shown to cause cancer in animals and may cause cancer in
humans. Reducing Exposure to Formaldehyde in Homes Ask about the formaldehyde
content of pressed wood products, including building materials, cabinetry,
and furniture before you purchase them. If you experience adverse reactions
to formaldehyde, you may want to avoid the use of pressed wood products
and other formaldehyde-emitting goods. Even if you do not experience such
reactions, you may wish to reduce your exposure as much as possible by
purchasing exterior-grade products, which emit less formaldehyde. For further
information on formaldehyde and consumer products, call the EPA Toxic Substance
Control Act (TSCA) assistance line (202-554-1404).</p>

<p>Some studies suggest that coating pressed wood products with polyurethane
may reduce formaldehyde emissions for some period of time. To be effective,
any such coating must cover all surfaces and edges and remain intact. Increase
the ventilation and carefully follow the manufacturernstructions while
applying these coatings. (If you are sensitive to formaldehyde, check the
label contents before purchasing coating products to avoid buying products
that contain formaldehyde, as they will emit the chemical for a short time
after application.) Maintain moderate temperature and humidity levels and
provide adequate ventilation. The rate at which formaldehyde is released
is accelerated by heat and may also depend somewhat on the humidity level.
Therefore, the use of dehumidifiers and air conditioning to control humidity
and to maintain a moderate temperature can help reduce formaldehyde emissions.
(Drain and clean dehumidifier collection trays frequently so that they
do not become a breeding ground for microorganisms.) Increasing the rate
of ventilation in your home will also help in reducing formaldehyde levels.
</p>

<p>PESTICIDES </p>

<p>According to a recent survey, 75 percent of U.S. households used at
least one pesticide product indoors during the past year. Products used
most often are insecticides and disinfectants. Another study suggests that
80 percent of most people's exposure to pesticides occurs indoors and that
measurable levels of up to a dozen pesticides have been found in the air
inside homes. The amount of pesticides found in homes appears to be greater
than can be explained by recent pesticide use in those households; other
possible sources include contaminated soil or dust that floats or is tracked
in from outside, stored pesticide containers, and household surfaces that
collect and then release the pesticides. Pesticides used in and around
the home include products to control insects (insecticides), termites (termiticides),
rodents (rodenticides), fungi (fungicides), and microbes (disinfectants).
They are sold as sprays, liquids, sticks, powders, crystals, balls, and
foggers.</p>

<p>In 1990, the American Association of Poison Control Centers reported
that some 79,000 children were involved in common household pesticide poisonings
or exposures. In households with children under five years old, almost
one-half stored at least one pesticide product within reach of children.
EPA registers pesticides for use and requires manufacturers to put information
on the label about when and how to use the pesticide. It is important to
remember that the to kill.ese products can be dangerous if not used properly.
In addition to the active ingredient, pesticides are also made up of ingredients
that are used to carry the active agent. These carrier agents are called
Household Products. However, as with other household products, there is
insufficient understanding at present about what pesticide concentrations
are necessary to produce these effects. Exposure to high levels of cyclodiene
pesticides, commonly associated with misapplication, has produced various
symptoms, including headaches, dizziness, muscle twitching, weakness, tingling
sensations, and nausea. In addition, EPA is concerned that cyclodienes
might cause long-term damage to the liver and the central nervous system,
as well as an increased risk of cancer. There is no further sale or commercial
use permitted for the following cyclodiene or related pesticides: chlordane,
aldrin, dieldrin, and heptachlor. The only exception is the use of heptachlor
by utility companies to control fire ants in underground cable boxes.</p>

<p>Reducing Exposure to Pesticides in Homes</p>

<p>1) Read the label and follow the directions.</p>

<p>It is illegal to use any pesticide in any manner inconsistent with the
directions on its label. Unless you have had special training and are certified,
never use a pesticide that is restricted to use by state-certified pest
control operators. Such pesticides are simply too dangerous for application
by a noncertified person.</p>

<p>2) Use only the pesticides approved for use by the general public and
then only in recommended amounts; increasing the amount does not offer
more protection against pests and can be harmful to you and your plants
and pets. </p>

<p>3) Ventilate the area well after pesticide use.</p>

<p>Mix or dilute pesticides outdoors or in a well-ventilated area and only
in the amounts that will be immediately needed. If possible, take plants
and pets outside when applying pesticides to them. </p>

<p>4) Use nonchemical methods of pest control when possible.</p>

<p>Since pesticides can be found far from the site of their original application,
it is prudent to reduce the use of chemical pesticides outdoors as well
as indoors. Depending on the site and pest to be controlled, one or more
of the following steps can be effective: use of biological pesticides,
such as Bacillus thuringiensis, for the control of gypsy moths; selection
of disease-resistant plants; and frequent washing of indoor plants and
pets. Termite damage can be reduced or prevented by making certain that
wooden building materials do not come into direct contact with the soil
and by storing firewood away from the home. By appropriately fertilizing,
watering, and aerating lawns, the need for chemical pesticide treatments
of lawns can be dramatically reduced.</p>

<p>5) If you decide to use a pest control company, choose one carefully.
</p>

<p>Ask for an inspection of your home and get a written control program
for evaluation before you sign a contract. The control program should list
specific names of pests to be controlled and chemicals to be used; it should
also reflect any of your safety concerns. Insist on a proven record of
competence and customer satisfaction. </p>

<p>6) Dispose of unwanted pesticides safely.</p>

<p>If you have unused or partially used pesticide containers you want to
get rid of, dispose of them according to the directions on the label or
on special household hazardous waste collection days. If there are no such
collection days in your community, work with others to organize them.</p>

<p>7) Keep exposure to moth repellents to a minimum. </p>

<p>One pesticide often found in the home is paradichlorobenzene, a commonly
used active ingredient in moth repellents. This chemical is known to cause
cancer in animals, but substantial scientific uncertainty exists over the
effects, if any, of long-term human exposure to paradichlorobenzene. EPA
requires that products containing paradichlorobenzene bear warnings such
as &quot;avoid breathing vapors&quot; to warn users of potential short-term
toxic effects. Where possible, paradichlorobenzene, and items to be protected
against moths, should be placed in trunks or other containers that can
be stored in areas that are separately ventilated from the home, such as
attics and detached garages. Paradichlorobenzene is also the key active
ingredient in many air fresheners (in fact, some labels for moth repellents
recommend that these same products be used as air fresheners or deodorants).
Proper ventilation and basic household cleanliness will go a long way toward
preventing unpleasant odors. </p>

<p>8) Call the National Pesticide Telecommunications Network (NPTN).</p>

<p>EPA sponsors the NPTN (800-858-PEST) to answer your questions about
pesticides and to provide selected EPA publications on pesticides. </p>

<p>ASBESTOS </p>

<p>Asbestos is a mineral fiber that has been used commonly in a variety
of building construction materials for insulation and as a fire-retardant.
EPA and CPSC have banned several asbestos products. Manufacturers have
also voluntarily limited uses of asbestos. Today, asbestos is most commonly
found in older homes, in pipe and furnace insulation materials, asbestos
shingles, millboard, textured paints and other coating materials, and floor
tiles. Elevated concentrations of airborne asbestos can occur after asbestos-containing
materials are disturbed by cutting, sanding or other remodeling activities.
Improper attempts to remove these materials can release asbestos fibers
into the air in homes, increasing asbestos levels and endangering people
living in those homes. </p>

<p>Health Effects of Asbestos</p>

<p>The most dangerous asbestos fibers are too small to be visible. After
they are inhaled, they can remain and accumulate in the lungs. Asbestos
can cause lung cancer, meso-thelioma (a cancer of the chest and abdominal
linings), and asbestosis (irreversible lung scarring that can be fatal).
Symptoms of these diseases do not show up until many years after exposure
began. Most people with asbestos-related diseases were exposed to elevated
concentrations on the job; some developed disease from exposure to clothing
and equipment brought home from job sites.</p>

<p>Reducing Exposure to Asbestos in Homes</p>

<p>1) Learn how asbestos problems are created in homes. </p>

<p>Read the booklet, Asbestos in Your Home, issued by CPSC, the ALA, and
EPA. To contact these organizations, see the section, &quot;Where to Go
For More Information.</p>

<p>2) If you think your home may have asbestos, dont panic! </p>

<p>Usually it is best to leave asbestos material that is in good condition
alone. Generally, material in good condition will not release asbestos
fiber. There is no danger unless fibers are released and inhaled into the
lungs. Do not cut, rip, or sand asbestos-containing materials. Leave undamaged
materials alone and, to the extent possible, prevent them from being damaged,
disturbed, or touched. Periodically inspect for damage or deterioration.</p>

<p>3) Discard damaged or worn asbestos gloves, stove-top pads, or ironing
board covers.</p>

<p>Check with local health, environmental, or other appropriate officials
to find out about proper handling and disposal procedures. If asbestos
material is more than slightly damaged, or if you are going to make changes
in your home that might disturb it, repair or removal by a professional
is needed.</p>

<p>4) Before you have your house remodeled, find out whether asbestos materials
are present. </p>

<p>5) When you need to remove or clean up asbestos, use a professionally
trained contractor. </p>

<p>Select a contractor only after careful discussion of the problems in
your home and the steps the contractor will take to clean up or remove
them. Consider the option of sealing off the materials instead of removing
them. </p>

<p>Call EPASCA assistance line (202-554-1404) to find out whether your
state has a training and certification program for asbestos removal contractors
and for information on EPAsbestos programs.</p>

<p>LEAD</p>

<p>Lead has long been recognized as a harmful environmental pollutant.
In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services
called lead the &quot;number one environmental threat to the health of
children in the United States.&quot; There are many ways in which humans
are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, contaminated soil,
deteriorating paint, and dust. Airborne lead enters the body when an individual
breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has settled. Before
it was known how harmful lead could be, it was used in paint, gasoline,
water pipes, and many other products. Old lead-based paint is the most
significant source of lead exposure in the U.S. today. Harmful exposures
to lead can be created when lead-based paint is improperly removed from
surfaces by dry scraping, sanding, or open-flame burning. High concentrations
of airborne lead particles in homes can also result from lead dust from
outdoor sources, including contaminated soil tracked inside, and use of
lead in certain indoor activities such as soldering and stained-glass making.</p>

<p>Health Effects of Exposure to Lead</p>

<p>Lead affects practically all systems within the body. At high levels
it can cause convulsions, coma, and even death. Lower levels of lead can
adversely affect the brain, central nervous system, blood cells, and kidneys.
The effects of lead exposure on fetuses and young children can be severe.
They include delays in physical and mental development, lower IQ levels,
shortened attention spans, and increased behavioral problems. Fetuses,
infants, and children are more vulnerable to lead exposure than adults
since lead is more easily absorbed into growing bodies, and the tissues
of small children are more sensitive to the damaging effects of lead. Children
may have higher exposures since they are more likely to get lead dust on
their hands and then put their fingers or other lead-contaminated objects
into their mouths. Get your child tested for lead exposure. To find out
where to do this, call your doctor or local health clinic. For more information
on health effects, get a copy of the Centers for Disease Control's, Preventing
Lead Poisoning in Young Children (October 1991). </p>

<p>Ways to Reduce Exposure to Lead</p>

<p>1) Keep areas where children play as dust-free and clean as possible.
</p>

<p>Mop floors and wipe window ledges and chewable surfaces such as cribs
with a solution of powdered automatic dishwasher detergent in warm water.
(Dishwasher detergents are recommended because of their high content of
phosphate.) Most multi-purpose cleaners will not remove lead in ordinary
dust. Wash toys and stuffed animals regularly. Make sure that children
wash their hands before meals, nap time, and bedtime. </p>

<p>2) Reduce the risk from lead-based paint. </p>

<p>Most homes built before 1960 contain heavily leaded paint. Some homes
built as recently as 1978 may also contain lead paint. This paint could
be on window frames, walls, the outside of homes, or other surfaces. Do
not burn painted wood since it may contain lead.</p>

<p>3) Leave lead-based paint undisturbed if it is in good condition; do
not sand or burn off paint that may contain lead.</p>

<p>Lead paint in good condition is usually not a problem except in places
where painted surfaces rub against each other and create dust (for example,
opening a window).</p>

<p>4) Do not remove lead paint yourself.</p>

<p>Individuals have been poisoned by scraping or sanding lead paint because
these activities generate large amounts of lead dust. Consult your state
health or housing department for suggestions on which private laboratories
or public agencies may be able to help test your home for lead in paint.
Home test kits cannot detect small amounts of lead under some conditions.
Hire a person with special training for correcting lead paint problems
to remove lead-based paint. Occupants, especially children and pregnant
women, should leave the building until all work is finished and clean-up
is done. </p>

<p>For additional information dealing with lead-based paint abatement contact
the Department of Housing and Urban Development for the following two documents:
Comprehensive and Workable Plan for the Abatement of Lead-Based Paint in
Privately Owned Housing: Report to Congress (December 7, 1990) and Lead-Based
Paint: Interim Guidelines for Hazard Identification and Abatement in Public
and Indian Housing (September 1990).</p>

<p>5) Do not bring lead dust into the home. </p>

<p>If you work in construction, demolition, painting, with batteries, in
a radiator repair shop or lead factory, or your hobby involves lead, you
may unknowingly bring lead into your home on your hands or clothes. You
may also be tracking in lead from soil around your home. Soil very close
to homes may be contaminated from lead paint on the outside of the building.
Soil by roads and highways may be contaminated from years of exhaust fumes
from cars and trucks that used leaded gas. Use door mats to wipe your feet
before entering the home. If you work with lead in your job or a hobby,
change your clothes before you go home and wash these clothes separately.
Encourage your children to play in sand and grassy areas instead of dirt
which sticks to fingers and toys. Try to keep your children from eating
dirt, and make sure they wash their hands when they come inside. </p>

<p>6) Find out about lead in drinking water. </p>

<p>Most well and city water does not usually contain lead. Water usually
picks up lead inside the home from household plumbing that is made with
lead materials. The only way to know if there is lead in drinking water
is to have it tested. Contact the local health department or the water
supplier to find out how to get the water tested. Send for the EPA pamphlet,
Lead and Your Drinking Water, for more information about what you can do
if you have lead in your drinking water. Call EPA's Safe Drinking Water
Hotline (800-426-4791) for more information.</p>

<p>7) Eat right. </p>

<p>A child who gets enough iron and calcium will absorb less lead. Foods
rich in iron include eggs, red meats, and beans. Dairy products are high
in calcium. Do not store food or liquid in lead crystal glassware or imported
or old pottery. If you reuse old plastic bags to store or carry food, keep
the printing on the outside of the bag. You can get a brochure, Lead Poisoning
and Your Children, and more information by calling the National Lead Information
Center, 800-LEAD-FYI. </p>

<p>WHEN BUILDING A NEW HOME </p>

<p>Building a new home provides the opportunity for preventing indoor air
problems. However, it can result in exposure to higher levels of indoor
air contaminants if careful attention is not given to potential pollution
sources and the air exchange rate. Express your concerns about indoor air
quality to your architect or builder and enlist his or her cooperation
in taking measures to provide good indoor air quality. Talk both about
purchasing building materials and furnishings that are low-emitting and
about providing an adequate amount of ventilation. The American Society
of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers recommends a
ventilation rate of 0.35 ach (air changes per hour) for new homes, and
some new homes are built to even tighter specifications. Particular care
should be given in such homes to preventing the build-up of indoor air
pollutants to high levels.</p>

<p>Here are a few important actions that can make a difference:</p>

<p>1) Use radon-resistant construction techniques.</p>

<p>Obtain a copy of the EPA booklet, Radon-Resistant Construction Techniques
for Residential Construction, from your state radon office or health agency,
your state homebuilders' association, or your EPA regional office.</p>

<p>2) Choose building materials and furnishings that will keep indoor air
pollution to a minimum.</p>

<p>There are many actions a homeowner can take to select products that
will prevent indoor air problems from occurring; a couple of them are mentioned
here. First, use exterior-grade pressed wood products made with phenol-formaldehyde
resin in floors, cabinetry, and wall surfaces. Or, as an alternative, consider
using solid wood products. Secondly, if you plan to install wall-to-wall
carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, especially concrete in basements,
make sure that an effective moisture barrier is installed prior to installing
the carpet. Do not per- manently adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives
so that the carpet can be removed if it becomes wet.</p>

<p>3) Provide proper drainage and seal foundations in new construction.</p>

<p>Air that enters the home through the foundation can contain more moisture
than is generated from all occupant activities. </p>

<p>4) Become familiar with mechanical ventilation systems and consider
installing one.</p>

<p>Advanced designs of new homes are starting to feature mechanical systems
that bring outdoor air into the home. Some of these designs include energy-efficient
heat recovery ventilators (also known as air-to-air heat exchangers).</p>

<p>5) Ensure that combustion appliances, including furnaces, fireplaces,
woodstoves, and heaters, are properly vented and receive enough supply
air. </p>

<p>Combustion gases, including carbon monoxide, and particles can be back-drafted
from the chimney or flue into the living space if the combustion appliance
is not properly vented or does not receive enough supply air. Back-drafting
can be a particular problem in weatherized or tightly constructed homes.
Installing a dedicated outdoor air supply for the combustion appliance
can help prevent backdrafting.</p>

<p>
<hr width="100%" ></p>

<p>DO YOU SUSPECT YOUR OFFICE HAS AN INDOOR AIR PROBLEM?</p>

<p>Indoor air quality problems are not limited to homes. In fact, many
office buildings have significant air pollution sources. Some of these
buildings may be inadequately ventilated. For example, mechanical ventilation
systems may not be designed or operated to provide adequate amounts of
outdoor air. Finally, people generally have less control over the indoor
environment in their offices than they do in their homes. As a result,
there has been an increase in the incidence of reported health problems.</p>

<p>HEALTH EFFECTS</p>

<p>A number of well-identified illnesses, such as Legionnaire's disease,
asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and humidifier fever, have been directly
traced to specific building problems. These are called building-related
illnesses. Most of these diseases can be treated; nevertheless, some pose
serious risks. Sometimes, however, building occupants experience symptoms
that do not fit the pattern of any particular illness and are difficult
to trace to any specific source. This phenomenon has been labeled sick
building syndrome. People may complain of one or more of the following
symptoms: dry or burning mucous membranes in the nose, eyes, and throat;
sneezing; stuffy or runny nose; fatigue or lethargy; headache; dizziness;
nausea; irritability and forgetfulness. Poor lighting, noise, vibration,
thermal discomfort, and psychological stress may also cause, or contribute
to, these symptoms. There is no single manner in which these health problems
appear. In some cases, problems begin as workers enter their offices and
diminish as workers leave; other times, symptoms continue until the illness
is treated. Sometimes there are outbreaks of illness among many workers
in a single building; in other cases, health symptoms show up only in individual
workers. In the opinion of some World Health Organization experts, up to
30 percent of new or remodeled commercial buildings may have unusually
high rates of health and comfort complaints from occupants that may potentially
be related to indoor air quality.</p>

<p>WHAT CAUSES PROBLEMS?</p>

<p>Three major reasons for poor indoor air quality in office buildings
are the presence of indoor air pollution sources; poorly designed, maintained,
or operated ventilation systems; and uses of the building that were unanticipated
or poorly planned for when the building was designed or renovated. Sources
of Office Air Pollution As with homes, the most important factor influencing
indoor air quality is the presence of pollutant sources. Commonly found
office pollutants and their sources include environmental tobacco smoke;
asbestos from insulating and fire-retardant building supplies; formaldehyde
from pressed wood products; other organics from building materials, carpet,
and other office furnishings, cleaning materials and activities, restroom
air fresheners, paints, adhesives, copying machines, and photography and
print shops; biological contaminants from dirty ventilation systems or
water-damaged walls, ceilings, and carpets; and pesticides from pest management
practices. Ventilation Systems Mechanical ventilation systems in large
buildings are designed and operated not only to heat and cool the air,
but also to draw in and circulate outdoor air. If they are poorly designed,
operated, or maintained, however, ventilation systems can contribute to
indoor air problems in several ways. For example, problems arise when,
in an effort to save energy, ventilation systems are not used to bring
in adequate amounts of outdoor air. Inadequate ventilation also occurs
if the air supply and return vents within each room are blocked or placed
in such a way that outdoor air does not actually reach the breathing zone
of building occupants. Improperly located outdoor air intake vents can
also bring in air contaminated with automobile and truck exhaust, boiler
emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from restrooms. Finally,
ventilation systems can be a source of in door pollution themselves by
spreading biological contaminants that have multiplied in cooling towers,
humidifiers, dehumidifiers, air conditioners, or the inside surfaces of
ventilation duct work.</p>

<p>Use of the Building Indoor air pollutants can be circulated from portions
of the building used for specialized purposes, such as restaurants, print
shops, and dry-cleaning stores, into offices in the same building. Carbon
monoxide and other components of automobile exhaust can be drawn from underground
parking garages through stairwells and elevator shafts into office spaces.
In addition, buildings originally designed for one purpose may end up being
converted to use as office space. If not properly modified during building
renovations, the room partitions and ventilation system can contribute
to indoor air quality problems by restricting air recirculation or by providing
an inadequate supply of outdoor air. </p>

<p>WHAT TO DO IF YOU SUSPECT A PROBLEM</p>

<p>If you or others at your office are experiencing health or comfort problems
that you suspect may be caused by indoor air pollution, you can do the
following: </p>

<p>1) Talk with other workers, your supervisor, and union representatives
to see if the problems are being experienced by others and urge that a
record of reported health complaints be kept by management, if one has
not already been established.</p>

<p>2) Talk with your own physician and report your problems to the company
physician, nurse, or health and safety officer. </p>

<p>3) Call your state or local health department or air pollution control
agency to talk over the symptoms and possible causes.</p>

<p>4) Encourage building management to obtain a copy of Building Air Quality:
A Guide for Building Owners and Facility Managers. Building Air Quality
(BAQ) is simply written, yet provides comprehensive information for identifying,
correcting, and preventing indoor air quality problems. BAQ also provides
supporting information such as when and how to select outside technical
assistance, how to communicate with others regarding indoor air issues,
and where to find additional sources of information. BAQ is available for
$24 from U.S. GPO, Superintendent of Documents, P.O. Box 371954, Pittsburgh,
PA 15250-7954; stock #055-000-00390-4 or call (202) 783-3238.</p>

<p>5) Frequently, indoor air quality problems in large commercial buildings
cannot be effectively identified or remedied without a comprehensive building
investigation. These investigations may start with written questionnaires
and telephone consultations in which building investigators assess the
history of occupant symptoms and building operation procedures. In some
cases, these inquiries may quickly uncover the problem and on-site visits
are unnecessary.</p>

<p>6) More often, however, investigators will need to come to the building
to conduct personal interviews with occupants, to look for possible sources
of the problems, and to inspect the design and operation of the ventilation
system and other building features. Because taking measurements of pollutants
at the very low levels often found in office buildings is expensive and
may not yield information readily useful in identifying problem sources,
investigators may not take many measurements. The process of solving indoor
air quality problems that result in health and comfort complaints can be
a slow one, involving several trial solutions before successful remedial
actions are identified. </p>

<p>7) If a professional company is hired to conduct a building investigation,
select a company on the basis of its experience in identifying and solving
indoor air quality problems in nonindustrial buildings. </p>

<p>8) Work with others to establish a smoking policy that eliminates involuntary
nonsmoker exposure to environmental tobacco smoke.</p>

<p>9) Call the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)
for information on obtaining a health hazard evaluation of your office
(800-35NIOSH), or contact the Occupational Safety and Health Administration,
(202) 219-8151.</p>

<p>
<hr width="100%" ></p>

<p>COMMON ALLERGEN</p>

<p>Dust mites, microscopic animals found in household dust, produce a common
allergen. Exposure to house dust mites, animal-related allergens (animal
dander and cat saliva), and mold have been estimated to cause 200,000 or
more emergency room visits a year by asthma patients. Humid or damp conditions
usually lead to greater numbers of dust mites.</p>

<p>
<hr width="100%" ></p>

<p>WHAT ABOUT CARPET?</p>

<p>In recent years, a number of consumers have associated a variety of
symptoms with the installation of new carpet. Scientists have not been
able to determine whether the chemicals emitted by new carpets are responsible.
If you are installing new carpet, you may wish to take the following steps:</p>

<p>1) Talk to your carpet retailer. Ask for information on emissions from
carpet.</p>

<p>2) Ask the retailer to unroll and air out the carpet in a well-ventilated
area before installation. </p>

<p>3) Ask for low-emitting adhesives if adhesives are needed.</p>

<p>4) Consider leaving the premises during and immediately after carpet
installation. You may wish to schedule the installation when most family
members or office workers are out.</p>

<p>5) Be sure the retailer requires the installer to follow the Carpet
and Rug Institute's installation guidelines.</p>

<p>6) Open doors and windows. Increasing the amount of fresh air in the
home will reduce exposure to most chemicals released from carpet. During
and after installation, use window fans, room air conditioners, or other
mechanical ventilation equipment you may have installed in your house,
to exhaust fumes to the outdoors. Keep them running for 48 to 72 hours
after the new carpet is installed.</p>

<p>7) Contact your carpet retailer if objectionable odors persist.</p>

<p>8) Follow the manufacturer's instructions for proper carpet maintenance.</p>

<p><b>REFERENCE GUIDE TO MAJOR INDOOR AIR POLLUTANTS IN THE HOME</b></p>

<p>The pollutants listed in this guide have been shown to cause the health
effects mentioned. However, it is not necessarily true that the effects
noted occur at the pollutant concentration levels typically found in the
home. In many cases, our understanding of the pollutants and their health
effects is too limited to determine the levels at which the listed effects
could occur. </p>

<p><b>RADON</b></p>

<p><b>Sources</b>: Earth and rock beneath home; well water; building materials.</p>

<p><b>Health Effects</b>: No immediate symptoms. Estimated to contribute
to between 7,000 and 30,000 lung cancer deaths each year. Smokers are at
higher risk of developing radon-induced lung cancer.</p>

<p><b>Levels in Homes</b>: Based on a national residential radon survey
completed in 1991, the average indoor radon level is 1.3 picocuries per
liter (pCi/L). The average outdoor level is about 0.4 pCi/L.</p>

<p><b>Steps to Reduce Exposure</b>:</p>

<p>1)Test your home for radon_it's easy and inexpensive.</p>

<p>2)Fix your home if your radon level is 4 picocuries per liter (pCi/L)
or higher.</p>

<p>3)Radon levels less than 4 pCi/L still pose a risk, and in many cases
may be reduced.</p>

<p>4) If you want more information on radon, contact your state radon office,
or call 800-SOS RADON.</p>

<p><b>ENVIRONMENTAL TOBACCO SMOKE </b></p>

<p><b>Source</b>: Cigarette, pipe, and cigar smoking.</p>

<p><b>Health Effects</b>: Eye, nose, and throat irritation; headaches;
lung cancer; may contribute to heart disease. Specifically for children,
increased risk of lower respiratory tract infections, such as bronchitis
and pneumonia, and ear infections; build-up of fluid in the middle ear;
increased severity and frequency of asthma episodes; decreased lung function.</p>

<p><b>Levels in Homes</b>: Particle levels in homes without smokers or
other strong particle sources are the same as, or lower than, those outdoors.
Homes with one or more smokers may have particle levels several times higher
than outdoor levels.</p>

<p><b>Steps to Reduce Exposure:</b></p>

<p>1) Do not smoke in your home or permit others to do so.</p>

<p>2) Do not smoke if children are present, particularly infants and toddlers.</p>

<p>3) If smoking indoors cannot be avoided, increase ventilation in the
area where smoking takes place. Open windows or use exhaust fans.</p>

<p><b>BIOLOGICALS</b> </p>

<p><b>Sources</b>: Wet or moist walls, ceilings, carpets, and furniture;
poorly maintained humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and air conditioners; bedding;
household pets. </p>

<p><b>Health Effects</b>: Eye, nose, and throat irritation; shortness of
breath; dizziness; lethargy; fever; digestive problems. Can cause asthma;
humidifier fever; influenza and other infectious diseases.</p>

<p><b>Levels in Homes</b>: Indoor levels of pollen and fungi are lower
than outdoor levels (except where indoor sources of fungi are present).
Indoor levels of dust mites are higher than outdoor levels.</p>

<p><b>Steps to Reduce Exposure</b>: </p>

<p>1) Install and use fans vented to outdoors in kitchens and bathrooms.</p>

<p>2) Vent clothes dryers to outdoors.</p>

<p>3) Clean cool mist and ultrasonic humidifiers in accordance with manufacturer's
instructions and refill with clean water daily.</p>

<p>4) Empty water trays in air conditioners, dehumidifiers, and refrigerators
frequently. </p>

<p>5) Clean and dry or remove water-damaged carpets. </p>

<p>6) Use basements as living areas only if they are leakproof and have
adequate ventilation. Use dehumidifiers, if necessary, to maintain humidity
between 30_50 percent. </p>

<p><b>CARBON MONOXIDE </b></p>

<p><b>Sources</b>: Unvented kerosene and gas space heaters; leaking chimneys
and furnaces; back-drafting from furnaces, gas water heaters, woodstoves,
and fireplaces; gas stoves. Automobile exhaust from attached garages. Environmental
tobacco smoke.</p>

<p><b>Health Effects</b>: At low concentrations, fatigue in healthy people
and chest pain in people with heart disease. At higher concentrations,
impaired vision and coordination; headaches; dizziness; confusion; nausea.
Can cause flu-like symptoms that clear up after leaving home. Fatal at
very high concentrations.</p>

<p><b>Levels in Homes</b>: Average levels in homes without gas stoves vary
from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm). Levels near properly adjusted gas
stoves are often 5 to 15 ppm and those near poorly adjusted stoves may
be 30 ppm or higher.</p>

<p><b>Steps to Reduce Exposure</b>: </p>

<p>1) Keep gas appliances properly adjusted.</p>

<p>2) Consider purchasing a vented space heater when replacing an unvented
one.</p>

<p>3) Use proper fuel in kerosene space heaters.</p>

<p>4) Install and use an exhaust fan vented to outdoors over gas stoves.</p>

<p>5) Open flues when fireplaces are in use. </p>

<p>6) Choose properly sized woodstoves that are certified to meet EPA emission
standards. Make certain that doors on all woodstoves fit tightly. </p>

<p>7) Have a trained professional inspect, clean, and tune-up central heating
system (furnaces, flues, and chimneys) annually. Repair any leaks promptly.</p>

<p>8) Do not idle the car inside garage. </p>

<p><b>NITROGEN DIOXIDE</b></p>

<p><b>Sources</b>: Kerosene heaters, unvented gas stoves and heaters. Environmental
tobacco smoke.</p>

<p><b>Health Effects</b>: Eye, nose, and throat irritation. May cause impaired
lung function and increased respiratory infections in young children.</p>

<p><b>Levels in Homes</b>: Average level in homes without combustion appliances
is about half that of outdoors. In homes with gas stoves, kerosene heaters,
or unvented gas space heaters, indoor levels often exceed outdoor levels.
</p>

<p><b>Steps to Reduce Exposure</b>: See steps under carbon monoxide. </p>

<p><b>ORGANIC GASES</b></p>

<p><b>Sources</b>: Household products including: paints, paint strippers,
and other solvents; wood preservatives; aerosol sprays; cleansers and disinfectants;
moth repellents and air fresheners; stored fuels and automotive products;
hobby supplies; dry-cleaned clothing. </p>

<p><b>Health Effects</b>: Eye, nose, and throat irritation; headaches,
loss of coordination, nausea; damage to liver, kidney, and central nervous
system. Some organics can cause cancer in animals; some are suspected or
known to cause cancer in humans. </p>

<p><b>Levels in Homes</b>: Studies have found that levels of several organics
average 2 to 5 times higher indoors than outdoors. During and for several
hours immediately after certain activities, such as paint stripping, levels
may be 1,000 times background outdoor levels.</p>

<p><b>Steps to Reduce Exposure</b>:</p>

<p>1) Use household products according to manufacturer's directions.</p>

<p>2) Make sure you provide plenty of fresh air when using these products.</p>

<p>3) Throw away unused or little-used containers safely; buy in quantities
that you will use soon.</p>

<p>4) Keep out of reach of children and pets.</p>

<p>5) Never mix household care products unless directed on the label.</p>

<p><b>RESPIRABLE PARTICLES</b></p>

<p><b>Sources</b>: Fireplaces, woodstoves, and kerosene heaters. Environmental
tobacco smoke.</p>

<p><b>Health Effects</b>: Eye, nose, and throat irritation; respiratory
infections and bronchitis; lung cancer. (Effects attributable to environmental
tobacco smoke are listed elsewhere.)</p>

<p><b>Levels in Homes</b>: Particle levels in homes without smoking or
other strong particle sources are the same as, or lower than, outdoor levels.</p>

<p><b>Steps to Reduce Exposure</b>:</p>

<p>1) Vent all furnaces to outdoors; keep doors to rest of house open when
using unvented space heaters.</p>

<p>2) Choose properly sized woodstoves, certified to meet EPA emission
standards; make certain that doors on all woodstoves fit tightly. </p>

<p>3) Have a trained professional inspect, clean, and tune-up central heating
system (furnace, flues, and chimneys) annually. Repair any leaks promptly.
</p>

<p>4) Change filters on central heating and cooling systems and air cleaners
according to manufac-turer's directions.</p>

<p><b>FORMALDEHYDE</b></p>

<p><b>Sources</b>: Pressed wood products (hardwood plywood wall paneling,
particleboard, fiberboard) and furniture made with these pressed wood products.
Urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI). Combustion sources and environmental
tobacco smoke. Durable press drapes, other textiles, and glues. </p>

<p><b>Health Effects</b>: Eye, nose, and throat irritation; wheezing and
coughing; fatigue; skin rash; severe allergic reactions. May cause cancer.
May also cause other effects listed under &quot;organic gases.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Levels in Homes</b>: Average concentrations in older homes without
UFFI are generally well below 0.1 (ppm). In homes with significant amounts
of new pressed wood products, levels can be greater than 0.3 ppm.</p>

<p><b>Steps to Reduce Exposure</b>: </p>

<p>1) Use &quot;exterior-grade&quot; pressed wood products (lower-emitting
because they contain phenol resins, not urea resins).</p>

<p>2) Use air conditioning and dehumidifiers to maintain moderate temperature
and reduce humidity levels.</p>

<p>3) Increase ventilation, particularly after bringing new sources of
formaldehyde into the home.</p>

<p><b>PESTICIDES</b></p>

<p><b>Sources</b>: Products used to kill household pests (insecticides,
termiticides, and disinfectants). Also, products used on lawns and gardens
that drift or are tracked inside the house.</p>

<p><b>Health Effects</b>: Irritation to eye, nose, and throat; damage to
central nervous system and kidney; increased risk of cancer. </p>

<p><b>Levels in Homes</b>: Preliminary research shows widespread presence
of pesticide residues in homes.</p>

<p><b>Steps to Reduce Exposure</b>:</p>

<p>1) Use strictly according to manufacturer's directions.</p>

<p>2) Mix or dilute outdoors.</p>

<p>3) Apply only in recommended quantities. </p>

<p>4) Increase ventilation when using indoors. Take plants or pets outdoors
when applying pesticides to them.</p>

<p>5) Use nonchemical methods of pest control where possible. </p>

<p>6) If you use a pest control company, select it carefully.</p>

<p>7) Do not store unneeded pesticides inside home; dispose of unwanted
containers safely. </p>

<p>8) Store clothes with moth repellents in separately ventilated areas,
if possible. </p>

<p>9) Keep indoor spaces clean, dry, and well ventilated to avoid pest
and odor problems. </p>

<p><b>ASBESTOS</b></p>

<p><b>Sources</b>: Deteriorating, damaged, or disturbed insulation, fireproofing,
acoustical materials, and floor tiles.</p>

<p><b>Health Effects</b>: No immediate symptoms, but long-term risk of
chest and abdominal cancers and lung diseases. Smokers are at higher risk
of developing asbestos-induced lung cancer.</p>

<p><b>Levels in Homes:</b> Elevated levels can occur in homes where asbestos-containing
materials are damaged or disturbed. </p>

<p><b>Steps to Reduce Exposure</b>:</p>

<p>1) It is best to leave undamaged asbestos material alone if it is not
likely to be disturbed. </p>

<p>2) Use trained and qualified contractors for control measures that may
disturb asbestos and for cleanup.</p>

<p>3)Follow proper procedures in replacing woodstove door gaskets that
may contain asbestos.</p>

<p><b>LEAD</b></p>

<p><b>Sources</b>: Lead-based paint, contaminated soil, dust, and drinking
water.</p>

<p><b>Health Effects</b>: Lead affects practically all systems within the
body. Lead at high levels (lead levels at or above 80 micrograms per deciliter
(80 _g/dl) of blood) can cause convulsions, coma, and even death. Lower
levels of lead can cause adverse health effects on the central nervous
system, kidney, and blood cells. Blood lead levels as low as 10 _g/dl can
impair mental and physical development. </p>

<p><b>Steps to Reduce Exposure</b>:</p>

<p>1) Keep areas where children play as dust-free and clean as possible.</p>

<p>2) Leave lead-based paint undisturbed if it is in good condition; do
not sand or burn off paint that may contain lead.</p>

<p>3) Do not remove lead paint yourself. </p>

<p>4) Do not bring lead dust into the home. </p>

<p>5) If your work or hobby involves lead, change clothes and use doormats
before entering your home. </p>

<p>6) Eat a balanced diet, rich in calcium and iron. </p>

<p><b>PESTS</b></p>

<p>There are simple steps people can take to prevent, reduce, or control
pest infestations. Such techniques can become part of an overall pest management
program (sometimes called &quot;integrated&quot; pest management) that
relies on many techniques, not just chemicals.</p>

<h2>Sick Building Syndrome</h2>

<p>INTRODUCTION</p>

<p>The term &quot;sick building syndrome&quot; (SBS) is used to describe
situations in which building occupants experience acute health and comfort
effects that appear to be linked to time spent in a building, but no specific
illness or cause can be identified. The complaints may be localized in
a particular room or zone, or may be widespread throughout the building.In
contrast, the term &quot;building related illness&quot; (BRI) is used when
symptoms of diagnosable illness are identified and can be attributed directly
to airborne building contaminants.</p>

<p>A 1984 World Health Organization Committee report suggested that up
to 30 percent of new and remodeled buildings worldwide may be the subject
of excessive complaints related to indoor air quality (IAQ). Often this
condition is temporary, but some buildings have long-term problems.Frequently,
problems result when a building is operated or maintained in a manner that
is inconsistent with its original design or prescribed operating procedures.
Sometimes indoor air problems are a result of poor building design or occupant
activities. </p>

<p>Indicators of SBS include: </p>

<ol>
<li>Building occupants complain of symptoms associated with acute discomfort,
e.g., headache; eye, nose, or throat irritation; dry cough; dry or itchy
skin; dizziness and nausea; difficulty in concentrating; fatigue; and sensitivity
to odors.</li>

<li>The cause of the symptoms is not known.</li>

<li>Most of the complainants report relief soon after leaving the building.</li>
</ol>

<p>Indicators of BRI include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Building occupants complain of symptoms such as cough; chest tightness;
fever, chills; and muscle aches.</li>

<li>The symptoms can be clinically defined and have clearly identifiable
causes.</li>

<li>Complainants may require prolonged recovery times after leaving the
building. </li>
</ul>

<p>It is important to note that complaints may result from other causes.
These may include an illness contracted outside the building, acute sensitivity
(e.g., allergies), job related stress or dissatisfaction, and other psychosocial
factors. Nevertheless, studies show that symptoms may be caused or exacerbated
by indoor air quality problems.</p>

<p><b>Causes of Sick Building Syndrome</b></p>

<p>The following have been cited causes of or contributing factors to sick
building syndrome:</p>

<p><b>Inadequate ventilation</b>: In the early and mid 1900's, building
ventilation standards called for approximately 15 cubic feet per minute
(cfm) of outside air for each building occupant, primarily to dilute and
remove body odors. As a result of the 1973 oil embargo, however, national
energy conservation measures called for a reduction in the amount of outdoor
air provided for ventilation to 5 cfm per occupant. In many cases these
reduced outdoor air ventilation rates were found to be inadequate to maintain
the health and comfort of building occupants. Inadequate ventilation, which
may also occur if heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems
do not effectively distribute air to people in the building, is thought
to be an important factor in SBS. In an effort to achieve acceptable IAQ
while minimizing energy consumption, the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating
and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recently revised its ventilation
standard to provide a minimum of 15 cfm of outdoor air per person (20 cfm/person
in office spaces). Up to 60 cfm/person may be required in some spaces (such
as smoking lounges) depending on the activities that normally occur in
that space (see ASHRAE Standard 62-1989).</p>

<p><b>Chemical contaminants from indoor sources</b>: Most indoor air pollution
comes from sources inside the building. For example, adhesives, carpeting,
upholstery, manufactured wood products, copy machines, pesticides, and
cleaning agents may emit volatile organic compounds (VOCs), including formaldehyde.
Environmental tobacco smoke contributes high levels of VOCs, other toxic
compounds, and respirable particulate matter. Research shows that some
VOCs can cause chronic and acute health effects at high concentrations,
and some are known carcinogens. Low to moderate levels of multiple VOCs
may also produce acute reactions. Combustion products such as carbon monoxide,
nitrogen dioxide, as well as respirable particles, can come from unvented
kerosene and gas space heaters, woodstoves, fireplaces and gas stoves.
</p>

<p><b>Chemical contaminants from outdoor sources</b>: The outdoor air that
enters a building can be a source of indoor air pollution. For example,
pollutants from motor vehicle exhausts; plumbing vents, and building exhausts
(e.g., bathrooms and kitchens) can enter the building through poorly located
air intake vents, windows, and other openings. In addition, combustion
products can enter a building from a nearby garage.</p>

<p><b>Biological contaminants</b>: Bacteria, molds, pollen, and viruses
are types of biological contaminants. These contaminants may breed in stagnant
water that has accumulated in ducts, humidifiers and drain pans, or where
water has collected on ceiling tiles, carpeting, or insulation. Sometimes
insects or bird droppings can be a source of biological contaminants. Physical
symptoms related to biological contamination include cough, chest tightness,
fever, chills, muscle aches, and allergic responses such as mucous membrane
irritation and upper respiratory congestion. One indoor bacterium, Legionella,
has caused both Legionnaire's Disease and Pontiac Fever.</p>

<p>These elements may act in combination, and may supplement other complaints
such as inadequate temperature, humidity, or lighting. Even after a building
investigation, however, the specific causes of the complaints may remain
unknown. </p>

<p><b>A Word About Radon and Asbestos... </b></p>

<p>SBS and BRI are associated with acute or immediate health problems;
radon and asbestos cause long-term diseases which occur years after exposure,
and are therefore not considered to be among the causes of sick buildings.
This is not to say that the latter are not serious health risks; both should
be included in any comprehensive evaluation of a building's IAQ.</p>

<p><b>Building Investigation Procedures </b></p>

<p>The goal of a building investigation is to identify and solve indoor
air quality complaints in a way that prevents them from recurring and which
avoids the creation of other problems. To achieve this goal, it is necessary
for the investigator(s) to discover whether a complaint is actually related
to indoor air quality, identify the cause of the complaint, and determine
the most appropriate corrective actions.</p>

<p>An indoor air quality investigation procedure is best characterized
as a cycle of information gathering, hypothesis formation, and hypothesis
testing. It generally begins with a walkthrough inspection of the problem
area to provide information about the four basic factors that influence
indoor air quality: 1) the occupants, 2) the HVAC system, 3) possible pollutant
pathways, 4) possible contaminant sources.</p>

<p>Preparation for a walkthrough should include documenting easily obtainable
information about the history of the building and of the complaints; identifying
known HVAC zones and complaint areas; notifying occupants of the upcoming
investigation; and, identifying key individuals needed for information
and access. The walkthrough itself entails visual inspection of critical
building areas and consultation with occupants and staff.</p>

<p>The initial walkthrough should allow the investigator to develop some
possible explanations for the complaint. At this point, the investigator
may have sufficient information to formulate a hypothesis, test the hypothesis,
and see if the problem is solved. If it is, steps should be taken to ensure
that it does not recur. However, if insufficient information is obtained
from the walk through to construct a hypothesis, or if initial tests fail
to reveal the problem, the investigator should move on to collect additional
information to allow formulation of additional hypoth- eses. The process
of formulating hypotheses, testing them, and evaluating them continues
until the problem is solved. </p>

<p>Although air sampling for contaminants might seem to be the logical
response to occupant complaints, it seldom provides information about possible
causes. While certain basic measurements, e.g., temperature, relative humidity,
CO2, and air movement, can provide a useful &quot;snapshot&quot; of current
building conditions, sampling for specific pollutant concentrations is
often not required to solve the problem and can even be misleading. Contaminant
concentration levels rarely exceed existing standards and guidelines even
when occupants continue to report health complaints. Air sampling should
not be undertaken until considerable information on the factors listed
above has been collected, and any sampling strategy should be based on
a comprehensive understanding of how the build- ing operates and the nature
of the complaints. </p>

<p><b>Solutions to Sick Building Syndrome</b></p>

<p>Solutions to sick building syndrome usually include combinations of
the following:</p>

<p>1) Pollutant source removal or modification is an effective approach
to resolving an IAQ problem when sources are known and control is feasible.
Examples include routine maintenance of HVAC systems, e.g., periodic cleaning
or replacement of filters; replacement of water-stained ceiling tile and
carpeting; institution of smoking restrictions; venting contaminant source
emissions to the outdoors; storage and use of paints, adhesives, solvents,
and pesticides in well ventilated areas, and use of these pollutant sources
during periods of non-occupancy; and allowing time for building materials
in new or remodeled areas to off-gas pollutants before occupancy. Several
of these options may be exercised at one time. </p>

<p>2) Increasing ventilation rates and air distribution often can be a
cost effective means of reducing indoor pollutant levels. HVAC systems
should be designed, at a minimum, to meet ventilation standards in local
building codes; however, many systems are not operated or maintained to
ensure that these design ventilation rates are provided. In many buildings,
IAQ can be improved by operating the HVAC system to at least its design
standard, and to ASHRAE Standard 62-1989 if possible. When there are strong
pollutant sources, local exhaust ventilation may be appropriate to exhaust
contaminated air directly from the building. Local exhaust ventilation
is particularly recommended to remove pollutants that accumulate in specific
areas such as rest rooms, copy rooms, and printing facilities. (For a more
detailed discussion of ventilation, read Indoor Air Facts No. 3R, Ventilation
and Air Quality in Office Buildings.) </p>

<p>3) Air cleaning can be a useful adjunct to source control and ventilation
but has certain limitations. Particle control devices such as the typical
furnace filter are inexpensive but do not effectively capture small particles;
high performance air filters capture the smaller, respirable particles
but are relatively expensive to install and operate. Mechanical filters
do not remove gaseous pollutants. Some specific gaseous pollutants may
be removed by adsorbent beds, but these devices can be expensive and require
frequent replacement of the adsorbent material. In sum, air cleaners can
be useful, but have limited application.</p>

<p>Education and communication are important elements in both remedial
and preventive indoor air quality management programs. When building occupants,
management, and maintenance personnel fully communicate and understand
the causes and consequences of IAQ problems, they can work more effectively
together to prevent problems from occurring, or to solve them if they do.

<br>EPA-43-F-93-003 
<br>January 1993 
<h2 align=center>Respiratory Health Effects of Passive Smoking 
<br>Fact Sheet </h2>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has published a major
assessment of the respiratory health risks of passive smoking (Respiratory
Health Effects of Passive Smoking: Lung Cancer and Other Disorders; EPA/600/6-90/006F).
The report concludes that exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS)
-- commonly known as secondhand smoke -- is responsible for approximately
3,000 lung cancer deaths each year in nonsmoking adults and impairs the
respiratory health of hundreds of thousands of children. </p>

<h3>Background</h3>

<p>EPA studies of human exposure to air pollutants indicate that indoor
levels of many pollutants often are significantly higher than outdoor levels.
These levels of indoor air pollutants are of particular concern because
it is estimated that most people spend approximately 90 percent of their
time indoors. </p>

<p>In recent years, comparative risk studies performed by EPA and its Science
Advisory Board have consistently ranked indoor air pollution among the
top five environmental risks to public health. EPA, in close cooperation
with other federal agencies and the private sector, has begun a concerted
effort to better understand indoor air pollution and to reduce peoples'
exposure to air pollutants in offices, homes, schools and other indoor
environments where people live, work and play. </p>

<p>Tobacco smoking has long been recognized as a major cause of death and
disease, responsible for an estimated 434,000 deaths per year in the United
States. Tobacco use is known to cause lung cancer in humans, and is a major
risk factor for heart disease. </p>

<p>In recent years, there has been concern that non-smokers may also be
at risk for some of these health effects as a result of their exposure
( passive smoking&quot;) to the smoke exhaled by smokers and smoke given
off by the burning end of cigarettes. As part of its effort to address
all types of indoor air pollution, in 1988, EPA's Indoor Air Division requested
that EPA's Office of Research and Development (ORD) undertake an assessment
of the respiratory health effects of passive smoking. The report was prepared
by ORD's Office of Health and Environmental Assessment. </p>

<p>The document has been prepared under the authority of Title IV of Superfund
(The Radon Gas and Indoor Air Quality Research Act of 1986), which directs
EPA to conduct research and disseminate information on all aspects of indoor
air quality. </p>

<h3>Public and Scientific Reviews</h3>

<p>A draft of this assessment was released for public review in June 1990.
In December 1990, EPA's Science Advisory Board, a committee of independent
scientists, conducted a review of the draft report and submitted its comments
to the EPA Administrator in April 1991. In its comments, the SAB's Indoor
Air Quality/Total Human Exposure Committee concurred with the primary findings
of the report, but made a number of recommendations for strengthening it.
</p>

<p>Incorporating these recommendations, the Agency again transmitted a
new draft to the SAB in May of 1992 for a second review. Following a July
1992 meeting, the SAB panel endorsed the major conclusions of the report,
including its unanimous endorsement of the classification of environmental
tobacco smoke (ETS) as a Group A (known human) carcinogen. </p>

<p>EPA also received and reviewed more than 100 comments from the public,
and integrated appropriate revisions into the final risk assessment. </p>

<h3>Major Conclusions</h3>

<p>Based on the weight of the available scientific evidence, EPA has concluded
that the widespread exposure to environmental tobacco smoke in the U.S.
presents a serious and substantial public health risk. </p>

<p><b>In adults:</b> </p>

<p>ETS is a human lung carcinogen, responsible for approximately 3,000
lung cancer deaths annually in U.S. nonsmokers. ETS has been classified
as a Group A carcinogen under EPA's carcinogen assessment guidelines. This
classification is reserved for those compounds or mixtures which have been
shown to cause cancer in humans, based on studies in human populations.
</p>

<p><b>In children:</b> </p>

<p>ETS exposure increases the risk of lower respiratory tract infections
such as bronchitis and pneumonia. EPA estimates that between 150,000 and
300,000 of these cases annually in infants and young children up to 18
months of age are attributable to exposure to ETS. Of these, between 7,500
and 15,000 will result in hospitalization. </p>

<p>ETS exposure increases the prevalence of fluid in the middle ear, a
sign of chronic middle ear disease. </p>

<p>ETS exposure in children irritates the upper respiratory tract and is
associated with a small but significant reduction in lung function. </p>

<p>ETS exposure increases the frequency of episodes and severity of symptoms
in asthmatic children. The report estimates that 200,000 to 1,000,000 asthmatic
children have their condition worsened by exposure to environmental tobacco
smoke. </p>

<p>ETS exposure is a risk factor for new cases of asthma in chuldren who
have not previously displayed symptoms. </p>

<h3>Scope of the Report</h3>

<p>In 1986, the National Research Council (NRC) and the U.S. Surgeon General
independently assessed the health effects of exposure to ETS. Both of these
reports concluded that ETS can cause lung cancer in adult non-smokers and
that children of parents who smoke have increased frequency of respiratory
symptoms and lower respiratory tract infections. The EPA scientific assessment
builds on these reports and is based on a thorough review of all of the
studies in the available literature. </p>

<p>Since 1986, the number of studies which examine these issues in human
populations has more than doubled, resulting in a larger database with
which to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the potential effects which
passive smoking may have on the respiratory health of adults as well as
children. </p>

<p>Because only a very small number of studies on the possible association
between exposure to secondhand smoke and heart disease and other cancers
existed in the scientific literature at the time this assessment was first
undertaken, EPA has not conducted an assessment of the possible association
of heart disease and passive smoking. EPA is considering whether such an
assessment should be undertaken in the future, but has no plans to do so
at this time. </p>

<h3>Scientific Approach</h3>

<p>EPA reached its conclusions concerning the potential for ETS to act
as a human carcinogen based on an analysis of all of the available data,
including more than 30 epidemiologic (human) studies looking specifically
at passive smoking as well as information on active or direct smoking.
In addition, EPA considered animal data, biological measurements of human
uptake of tobacco smoke components and other available data. The conclusions
were based on what is commonly known as the total weight-of-evidence&quot;
rather than on any one study or type of study. </p>

<p>The finding that ETS should be classified as a Group A carcinogen is
based on the conclusive evidence of the dose-related lung carcinogenicity
of mainstream smoke in active smokers and the similarities of mainstream
and sidestream smoke given off by the burning end of the cigarette. The
finding is bolstered by the statistically significant exposure-related
increase in lung cancer in nonsmoking spouses of smokers which is found
in an analysis of more than 30 epidemiology studies that examined the association
between secondhand smoke and lung cancer. </p>

<p>The weight-of-evidence analysis for the noncancer respiratory effects
in children is based primarily on a review of more than 100 studies, including
50 recent epidemiology studies of children whose parents smoke. </p>

<h3>Beyond the Risk Assessment</h3>

<p>Although EPA does not have any regulatory authority for controlling
ETS, the Agency expects this report to be of value to other health professionals
and policymakers in taking appropriate steps to minimize peoples' exposure
to tobacco smoke in indoor environments. </p>

<p>In cooperation with other government agencies, EPA will carry out an
education and outreach program over the next two years to inform the public
and policy makers on what to do to reduce the health risks of ETS as well
as other indoor air pollutants. </p>

<font SIZE=+1>An Inside Look at Air Pollution Complicated public policy
issues are at stake </font>
<p>by Ken Sexton </p>

<p>On particularly smoggy days, small children and people with respiratory
illness are encouraged to stay indoors to avoid health risks from air pollution.
While this may be good advice if the goal is to reduce exposures to, let's
say, ozone, there is substantial evidence that concentrations of many airborne
pollutants are often higher inside buildings and vehicles than outside.
It is becoming increasingly apparent that being indoors, as, for example,
in a residence, office, or automobile, can offer protection from exposure
to some airborne agents, while at the same time increasing exposure to
others. </p>

<p>Concerns about the healthfulness of indoor air are driven by six major
factors. First, it is now widely recognized that most people spend more
than 90 percent of their time indoors. Groups potentially more susceptible
to the effects of air pollution, like infants, the infirm, and the elderly,
are inside virtually all the time. Because most of us spend so much time
inside, indoor pollution concentrations, even if they are uniformly lower
than outdoor levels, make a significant contribution to our average exposure
over a day, week, season, or year. </p>

<p>Second, modern indoor environments contain a complex array of potential
sources of air pollution, including synthetic building materials, consumer
products, and dust mites. Airborne emissions also occur because of the
people, pets, and plants that inhabit these spaces. Efforts to lower energy
costs by reducing ventilation rates have increased the likelihood that
pollutants generated indoors will accumulate. </p>

<p>Third, monitoring studies inside buildings and vehicles have consistently
found that concentrations of many air pollutants tend to be higher indoors
than out. Indoor air has been shown to be a complex mixture of chemical,
biological, and physical agents, only a small fraction of which has been
characterized adequately. This complexity is illustrated by the fact that
more than 4,000 different compounds have been identified in tobacco smoke
alone. </p>

<p>Fourth, scientific reports indicate that indoor measurements are often
better than outdoor measurements for classifying, estimating, and predicting
human exposures to many air pollutants. This is true even for some agents
that are primarily of outdoor origin. A promising approach to more realistic
exposure estimation is the development and refinement of models that combine
information about pollutant concentrations in both indoor and outdoor settings
with data on time-activity patterns. </p>

<p>Fifth among the factors driving indoor air concerns, complaints about
inadequate indoor air quality and associated discomfort and illness are
a burgeoning problem in our society. Reports of illness outbreaks among
building occupants, particularly office workers, with no secondary spread
of the illness to others outside the building with whom affected individuals
come into contact, have become commonplace. EPA classifies these reports
into two general categories. Building- related illness refers to episodes
when symptoms of diagnosable illness are identified and can be attributed
directly to airborne contaminants in the building. In contrast, sick-building
syndrome is defined as situations in which building occupants experience
acute health and comfort effects that appear to be linked to time spent
in the building, but no specific illness or cause can be identified. </p>

<p>The so-called chemical sensitivity syndromes, which may be caused only
partially or not at all by chemicals, are a different, although potentially
related matter. Broadly defined, &quot;multiple chemical sensitivity&quot;
(MCS) is postulated to be development of responsiveness, including manifestation
of often disabling symptoms, to extremely low concentrations of chemicals
following sensitization. A controversial and emotional topic, the concept
of MCS as a distinct entity caused by exposure to chemicals has been challenged
by the medical and scientific communities, and there appears to be consensus
that substantially more study is needed before MCS should be considered
as a clinical diagnosis. Nevertheless, many sufferers of MCS continue to
believe that their conditions are either caused or exacerbated by indoor
air pollution. </p>

<p>And sixth, exposures to many indoor air pollutants are known or suspected
to occur at levels sufficient to cause illness or injury. Scientific evidence
suggests that respiratory disease, allergy, mucous membrane irritation,
nervous system effects, cardiovascular effects, reproductive effects, and
lung cancer may be linked to exposures to indoor air pollutants. </p>

<p>Scientists consistently rank indoor air pollution at or near the top
of environmental health risks in the United States. EPA reports on risk-based
priority setting, like Unfinished Business (1987), Reducing Risk (1990),
and the Regional Comparative Risk Projects (1989-92), all ranked indoor
air pollution as a high- priority risk to human health. Public opinion
polls, however, continue to find that most Americans do not perceive the
risks of indoor air pollution to be great. </p>

<p>The specter of potential public health risks from contaminated indoor
air presents decision makers with a dilemma. Is the problem serious enough
to warrant intervention, and, if so, what preventive or remedial actions
are most appropriate? </p>

<p>The significance of indoor air exposures for acute and chronic health
effects remains uncertain in most cases. Nevertheless, there is ample reason
for concern and caution. For example, it has been estimated that exposures
of nonsmokers to ETS (Environmental Tobacco Smoke) may cause as many as
3,000 lung cancer deaths annually in the United States, as well as contribute
to a wide range of noncancer diseases, including pneumonia, bronchitis,
and asthma. Findings from several studies suggest that indoor concentrations
of nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, and respirable particles can exceed
the National Ambient (Outdoor) Air Quality Standards set by EPA to protect
public health. And results from many studies show that a plethora of volatile
organic chemicals and pesticides known to be toxic and/or carcinogenic
can occur indoors at concentrations significantly higher than levels that
create concerns in outdoor air. </p>

<p>Designing effective and efficient indoor control strategies requires
an understanding of several pertinent factors. Contaminant characteristics
need to be considered, including factors like concentration, reactivity,
and physical state. Emission source configurations (e.g., area or point
sources) must be taken into account, and it is necessary to determine whether
discharges are continuous or intermittent. It is also important to understand
the dose-response relationship for the contaminant of interest so that
informed decisions can be made whether individuals are to be protected
from short-term exposures to peak concentrations or from long-term exposures
to relatively low concentrations. And, of course, the type of indoor enclosure
(e.g., residence, office, car) has ramifications for which approaches and
methods are viable options. </p>

<p>But providing and maintaining healthful indoor air quality is more than
just a complex scientific and technical issue. Realization that contaminated
indoor air may pose an unacceptable health hazard raises complicated policy
questions about the proper role of government in safeguarding people's
health inside public and private spaces. </p>

<p>Because concerns about adverse health consequences from air pollution
have focused traditionally on outdoor and occupational exposures, federal
and state government programs concentrate on protecting public health from
outdoor air pollutants or protecting workers' health from dangerous air
pollutants in the industrial workplace. As mentioned earlier, EPA sets
and enforces National Ambient Air Quality Standards that are designed to
protect the general public to within an adequate margin of safety. The
Occupational Safety and Health Administration enforces consensus standards
for industrial work environments, which are designed such that no employee
will suffer material impairment of health or functional capacity. However,
federal responsibility and authority for indoor air quality in the nonworkplace
are less well defined. </p>

<p>There is ample precedent for government authority and responsibility
to protect public health and welfare inside buildings. It is common practice,
for instance, to regulate construction and operation of public buildings
to ensure that adequate provisions are made for health and safety. Government
inspectors routinely enforce building codes, health regulations, safety
rules, and fire ordinances. While government has an obligation to protect
public health in indoor as well as outdoor environments, the justification
for direct government intervention varies according to the characteristics
associated with different types of indoor settings. </p>

<p>Creation of a regulatory framework for protecting indoor environmental
quality poses special policy issues. Promulgation of indoor air quality
standards and other regulations must acknowledge that individuals, especially
in private residences, are already making decisions about their own air
quality. Development of effective and reasonable policy requires an appreciation
of the scope for private action, as well as consideration of the likelihood
that public intervention will foster improved private choices. </p>

<p>This is not to suggest that rules and regulations have no part to play
in safeguarding indoor air quality. This form of intervention is, however,
not necessarily optimal or even desirable in certain types of indoor environments.
There are, of course, many different types of indoor environments--for
example, occupational settings, both industrial and nonindustrial; nonoccupational
settings, including residential, commercial, institutional, and public;
and transportation microenvironments, such as automobiles, airplanes, subways,
and trains. </p>

<p>The role of government varies according to the &quot;publicness&quot;
of a particular space as well as the nature of air-pollution health risks,
either voluntary or nonvoluntary. Understanding the diversity of nonindustrial
indoor environments is an important step in the design and implementation
of practical and cost-effective control strategies. </p>

<p>The rationale for government regulation of outdoor air pollution is
based in part on a definition of outdoor air as a &quot;public good&quot;
and on the realization that those who suffer the effects of such pollution
are neither compensated by, nor powerful in influencing, polluters. The
situation is quite different for some indoor environments, especially private
residences, for both the costs and benefits of pollution control are internalized
with households. </p>

<p>If occupants foul the air in their home, they are forced to breathe
it. If they attempt to improve its quality by increasing ventilation or
installing air-cleaning devices, they bear the costs and enjoy the benefits.
For some contaminants, such as tobacco smoke, odorants, and water vapor,
benefits are readily recognizable through improvements in perceptible air
quality and reduction of corrosion, soiling, and molds. </p>

<p>The closed-loop, cost-benefit cycle within residences suggests that
individual decisions are important determinants of indoor air quality.
However, unlike residential energy consumption, where monthly bills from
the local utility company provide periodic feedback to consumers, indoor
contaminants may be below irritation or odor thresholds. Thus, although
individuals are certainly making decisions about their own air quality,
it is not clear that these are &quot;informed&quot; decisions. Government
actions aimed at improving personal decisions about indoor air quality
may be preferable to rules and regulations (e.g., simple warning devices,
product labeling, or information programs). </p>

<p>It has been suggested that the Clean Air Act be amended to give EPA
authority to control indoor air pollution in much the same way that outdoor
air pollution is currently controlled. However, setting and enforcing strict
indoor air quality standards, similar to existing National Ambient Air
Quality Standards, would be impractical because of the prohibitive monitoring
costs and the difficulty of enforcement within approximately 82 million
residences in the United States. </p>

<p>Perhaps the most serious impediment to implementing a regulatory approach
is public antipathy towards this form of intervention inside the home.
Restriction of indoor pollution sources, certification of &quot;safe&quot;
indoor concentrations, product emission standards, disclosure of potential
sources upon transfer of ownership, and specification of minimum ventilation
requirements are examples of government actions that are likely to be less
costly and more effective than indoor air quality standards. </p>

<p>Not all buildings are residences, and not all residences are owner-occupied.
The rationale for direct government intervention aimed at improving indoor
air quality is much stronger in public, as opposed to private buildings.
Air quality in large public buildings, for instance, displays many characteristics
of a public good. A person sensitive to tobacco smoke would not rationally
pay the costs of cleaning the air in a large convention hall. The costs
would greatly exceed any personal benefits an individual might derive from
smoke-free air, and those who did not contribute could not be excluded
from enjoying the benefits. In this situation, the rationale for regulation
is similar to that for outdoor air pollution. </p>

<p>There is also substantial justification for regulatory intervention
in private and public buildings where occupants do not have control over
their own environment--for example, modern high-rise office buildings.
Typically, building managers are responsible for operation and maintenance
of heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems. Occupants
of the building, including both employers and employees, often have little
or no direct control of temperature, fresh air input, and ventilation rate.
Because HVAC systems are normally operated to minimize energy costs, the
health and comfort of tenants rarely become an issue unless a significant
number of complaints are reported. </p>

<p>Because health risks in this situation tend to be nonvoluntary, government
may have a responsibility to safeguard public health by defining what constitutes
acceptable indoor air and taking steps to ensure that those criteria are
met. Examples of government actions that might be warranted include specification
of minimum ventilation rates necessary to achieve healthful indoor air
quality, establishment of emission limitations for building materials,
and development of indoor air quality guidelines or standards for important
contaminants. </p>

<p>As a practical matter, however, development of a comprehensive federal
approach to address problems of indoor air pollution awaits resolution
of important public policy and public health questions about the proper
role of government in safeguarding the air quality inside public and private
spaces. </p>

<h2><font COLOR="#0000FF">Class I Electrostatic High-efficiency Furnace Filter</font></h2>

<p><font SIZE=+1>Aero<b>&#183;</b>Pure Company has available specially constructed
replacement furnace filters which, when used in conjunction with our air
purification models ZN-51, 990 and the Wizard 2 will provide the maximum
cleanup process in the space being treated.</font></p>
<p><font size=+1>In addition, the use of these filters will reduce the amount of
Ozone required to maintain clean outdoor-air-like conditions in the heated space.
Some of the features of these filters are
shown in the accompanying diagram.</font></p>
<p><font size=+1>Because of their design and special
construction, these filters have features not normally found in the ordinary
furnace filter.</font></p>
<p><font size=+1>For example:</font></p>

<ul>
<li>They are twice as effective as typical furnace filters in removing
hair, lint and pollen.</li>

<li>For dust mites and bacteria they are up to ten times more effective
as the ordinary furnace filter.</li>

<li>They are washable and re-useable many times (instructions furnished
with each order).</li>

<li>Properly handled they can be expected to last for for many seasons.</li>

<li>Their high particle removal range reduces the re-cycling of captured
pollutants on the filter surfaces.</li>

<li>They come with a standard five-year warranty against defects in workmanship.</li>
</ul>

the right place!</h1>

<p><font SIZE=+1>The following pages will give you the opportunity to explore
the real problem of indoor air pollution in great depth. These pages were meant
to be informative, interesting, and eye-catching.
Concomitant with these goals, certain features, only available in the more
recent versions of browsers--like Netscape and Microsoft's Internet Explorer--were
incorporated into our pages. We encourage you, therefore, to download and
use either one of these fine browsers if you don't already have a recent
version, before viewing our pages. Just click on one of the buttons provided
below to download the most recent versions of either one...</font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>Then, &quot;come on in to AeroPure Country&quot;!</font></p>

<center><p><a href="http://www.netscape.com/comprod/mirror/index.html"><img src="now20_button.gif" border=0 height=31 width=88 align=abscenter></a>Download

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Note:&nbsp;your browser must be at least &quot;table-enabled&quot; for
the following pages to be readable. If the globe on the above Microsoft
button is spinning, you should be all right. If this globe <i>isn't</i>
spinning and you're not sure whether your browser can handle tables, press
the &quot;No&quot; button below. If the pages are a 'jumbled mess', then
you need to get a more recent version of your browser--or one of the two
browsers above--before you'll be able to explore our pages further.</p>

Even though a switched 10 freeway has 10 lanes, it still takes 10 times as long to get from here to there.  Taking the anaolgy one step further, switched 100 Mbps Ehternet is then a 10-lane autobahn where the speed limit is 100MPH.

<CENTER><B>General Facts About Achieving A Pregnancy</B><br></CENTER>
<FONT SIZE=2>The rate of conception for a couple is approximately 20% per cycle.  However, due to many factors which may impair fertility, one out of every six couples attempting to achieve a pregnancy will experience difficulty.  Our objective is to provide the best medical evaluation and therapy available in order to achieve a pregnancy in a minimal amount of time.<p></FONT>

<FONT SIZE=2><a name="ovulation"></a>
<CENTER><p><B>Ovulation Disorders</B><br></CENTER>
Ovulation disorders may be broken down into three distinct categories.  The first, anovulation, is when a woman does not ovulate at all.  ovulation inducing drugs, (also known as "fertility drugs") are used to correct anovulation.  The most commonly prescribed are Clomid (clomiphene citrate) or Serophone, an orally administered coumpound used to stimulate the release of pituitary gonadotropins to mediate ovulation.  We also use injectable medications comprised of lutenizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), also known as human menopausal gonadotropins (hMG), prescribed as Pergonal and Humegon.  A similar injectable drug, Metrodin, which is pure FSH minus the LH, is used in similar circumstances as hMG.  Its clinical application is to stimulate ovarian follicle growth and maturation.  The third fertility drug which would be prescribed, in cases where the serum prolactin level is elevated, would be bromocriptine.
<p>
Another type of ovulatory problem is a luteal phase defect.  There are two kinds of luteal phase defects, the first, referred to as a pure luteal phase defect, in which there is insufficient production of the hormone progesterone, but the follicle (the sac containing the egg) is mature.  Progesterone is needed to build up the uterine lining, to enable the embryo to implant.  To determine a progesterone deficiency an endometrial biopsy is performed, a simple procedure done in the office where a small sample of endometrial (uterine) tissue is obtained with a plastic pipette.  Supplementation of progestrone during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle (after ovulation) may be given.  Information regarding the benefits of progesterone and the options for treatment will be provided to patients in order that they may select the treatment option that best suits their physical comfort and financial affordability.
<p>
Another type of luteal phase defect is known as immature follicles.  This is determined by inadequate serum estradiol levels, less than 200 pg/mL, and or follicles size less than 18mm on ultrasound, both studies being performed at mid-cycle when follicular maturation occurs.  Ovulation inducing drugs, as previously described, are used to correct these defects.  The medication used tis chosen after careful monitoring with blood levels and ultrasound.  Each drug has its advantages and disadvantages.  Clomiphene citrate is a less expensive ovulation inducing drug, but may sometimes interfere with the production of cervical mucus (causing what is knwn as cervical factor-for a more detailed description see cervical factor below).  Although more costly, hMG in some cases is more effective in promothing follicular maturation.  The decision of which drug to employ is made after careful evaluation and consultation with your physician.
<p>
Another ovulation disorder is known as premature luteinization, when the production of progesterone occurs prematurely, that is before ovulation has taken place. Referred to medically as the follicle undergoing "atresia", it cuases the egg to die and destroys the cervical mucus needed to aid tin transporting the sperm thoufhg the cervix.  Once again, an ovulation inducing drug may be used to insure ovulation has taken place before the rise in progesterone.  Frequently, this may be corrected by first blocking the woman's LH through the use of high-dose estrogen or a drug known as a gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) which suppresses LH and FSH.  Examples include leuprolide acetate (Lupron) or nafarelin (Synarel).  These drugs would be followed by eiter Pergonal, Humegon or Metrodin.
<p>
<a name="cervical"></a>
<CENTER><B>Cervical Factor</B><br></CENTER>
Cervical factor, or inadequate quality or quanitity of cervical mucus is determined by perfoming a simple test known as the post-coital test (PCT).
<p>

<CENTER><B><a name="male"></a> Male Factor</B><br></CENTER>
It is important for couples to realize that fertility potential involves both partners.  Therefore, it is beneficial when performing a complete work-up for infertility to evaluate both partners.
<p>
<a name="mech"></a>
<CENTER><B>Mechanical Factor</B><br></CENTER>
To determine whehter or not the fallopian tubes are patent (open), one of two procedures is performed.

<CENTER><B><B>Endometriosis</B></B><br></CENTER>
Endometriosis is a disease in which tissue from the lining of the uterus implants itself on either the ovaries or other pelvic organs.
<p>
<a name="unex"></a>
<CENTER><B><B>Unexplained Infertility</B></B><br></CENTER>
Unexplained infertility can be treated in several ways.  If a male factor is supsected, either IUI or IVF may be performed.
<p>
<a name="art"></a>
<CENTER><B><B>Assisted Reproductive Techniques</B></B><br></CENTER>
Our in vitro fertilization (IVF) program began in 1988, then known as Endocrine Histology.  After expanding our practice in November 1991 by opening an office in Marlton, N.J., in an effort to increase efficiency and avoid any duplication, the decision was made to merge our PA and NJ programs to one location, which is now known as the Cooper Center for In Vitro Fertilization (located in our <A HREF="locations.htm">Marlton, NJ</A> office).

<p>
<a name="rsa"></a>
<CENTER><B>Recurrent Spontaneous Abortion</B><br></CENTER>
We have found through many studies and in clinical practice that there is immense benefit in using progesterone to prevent habitual or recurrent spontaneous abortions (RSA) or miscarriages in most women.

<p><a name="insure"></a>
<CENTER><B>Insurance</B><br></CENTER>
Various insurance plans are accepted by our practice.  These include many major managed care plans and HMO plans, as well as indemnity (private) insurance plans.  When calling for an appointment someone can advise you if your particular insurance plan is one our group participates in or accepts.
<p>There are differences in coverage, within the same insurance company, depending on the plan offered to you by your employer.  For this reson you should contact your Employee Benefits Department of call Member Services at the insurance company.  You would need to know what is covered and whether there are any time or cost limitations, and any or all exclusions.<p>
Our experienced and knowledgeable staff stands ready to assist you with your questions and claims.  Our practice is committed to your clinical, emotional, and financial well being.  Our fees compare most favorably to others who provide the same services.
<p>
<a name="research"></a>
<CENTER><B>Research</B><br></CENTER>
In addition to the clinical services described herein, we have established, within our practice, a research department whose staff is devoted to the collection and analysis of data, for the purpose of determining the most effective therapies and treatment modalities within our field. <p>The research team, headed by<A HREF="physicians.htm"> Dr. Check</A>, reports its scientific findings throughout the world via slide and poster presentations at international meetings and symposia, as well as publications in scientific books and journals.  Most importantly, our findings are applied right here in our own practice so that we can offer the most effective approach and treatments for the various factors that play a role in establishing and maintaining a healthy pregnancy.  In fact, our group has published over 300 manuscripts in peer review journals, mostly dealing with new methods of dianosing and treating infertility; thus, in addition to the teaching of medical students and OB/GYN residents at Robert Wood Johnson Medical School and Camden, our publications help physicians around the world to improve treatment of their patients.

<p>The department is comprised of a full-time staff of clinical and administrative personnel.  Some of our physicians, nurses and technologists also contribute to the time consuming task of collecting and evaluating data.  Our research is part of what makes us a unique center and contributes greatly to our ability to offer state of the art medicine.

<p>Because we like to provide our patients with as much information as possible, we do make available pamphlets and booklets from outside sources.  However, we do not necessarily always agree with all the treatments and therapies described therein.

<TITLE>Egg Donor Program</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<B>Cooper Institute's Oocyte Donor Program</B><br><hr><p>
<FONT SIZE=2>The Donor Oocyte (egg) Program was established in 1988 with the intent and purpose of making the IVF procedure more affordable.  Donation of oocytes is an option for those IVF participants in need of some financial assistance.  By donating half of the recovered eggs during an IVF cycle, the donor has the opportunity to assist another infertile person or couple to achieve a pregnancy, as well as receive some financial assistance to cover the expense of IVF.  The donor, in exchange for the sharing of her eggs, has the egg retrieval, the embryo transfer, and the necessary medications paid for by the recipient of the eggs.  Those IVF patients wishing to donate eggs are selected anonymously by a patient who needs donor eggs, (a recipient).  We cannot guarantee that all women wishing to be a donor will be selected.
<p>
The IVF cycle includes the ultrasound guided transvaginal retrieval, incubation, fertilization, and development of embryo(s), and transfer of embryos(s).  Both donor and recipient are responsible for their own preliminary IVF testing and bloodwork/ultrasounds for the cyle.  If necessary, each party will be responsible for the cost of sperm washing, sperm donation, sperm freezing, cryopreservation of excess embryos and embryo storage costs.
<p>
The total number of oocytes will be equally divided between the donor and the recipient at the time of retrieval.  If an odd number of oocytes is obtained, the recipient will receive the extra egg.  For instance, if fifteen oocytes are obtained, teh recipient will receive all of the eggs from that cycle.  The recipient will then be financially responsible for another IVF cycle and medications for the donor.  During the donor's then be financially responsible for another IVF cycle and medications for the donor.  During the donor's next attempt at retrieval, the donor will retain the same number of oocytes as produced in her previous cycle where less than five oocytes were obtained.  Any remaining oocytes will then be equally devided between the donor and the recipient, if requested by the recipient.  A donor who has produced fewer eggs than expected has the right to keep all the eggs for herself.  The recipient must be reimbursed for all of the medication costs.
<p>
The donor cycle will be automatically cancelled if during the follicle stimulation process they fail to produce an adequate amount of estradiol.  That level is defined as less than or equal to 120pg/ml on day five of Peronal/Metrodin/Humegon.  The recipient will be notified by the IVF staff that the cycle is cancelled.  The donor is obligated to return all unused medication to the recipient.
<p>
In the event the egg donor experiences ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome and must freeze all of the embryos, the egg recipient will be responsilbe for an additional $350.00 to cover the added expense of a frozen embryo transfer for the donor.
<p>
In the event a donor refuses to donate her oocytes in accordance to the procedure set forth above, the donor will then be responsilbe for the payment of all costs relating to the donor cycle.  This includes the retrieval, incubation and fertilization, transfer, any medication provided by the recipient, plus the recipient's medication costs for the cycle.  This payment must be made prior to the retrieval of oocytes.  The recipient is relieved of any further obligation to the donor if the donor refuses to donte.
<p>

A.  Before the Egg Retrieval
<OL TYPE=1 START=1 COMPACT>
<li><B>What<A HREF="C:/endocrine/Preliminary Testing.htm"> preliminary testing </A>is needed for myself and partner?</B><br>
Refer to the IVF packet for a list of all needed tests.  Please note that cultures need to be scheduled on weekdays only.  It takes ten days to get the results.  You should call the office where you had the testing done to make sure all of the testing is negative.
<li><B>Because I live a distance from the office, can I have my prelimary testing done at my docotrs office?</B><br>
We prefer that you have your reliminary testing done in the office the day you have the initial IVF consult and mock transfer, but other arrangements can be made if necessary.
<li>
<B>Is the male partner required to freeze a semen specimen and if so, can he do it with the inital semen analysis and cultures?<br>
</B>It is strongly suggested that a semen specimen be frozen prior to the egg retrieval.  If the male partner is ill on the day of the retrieval, the frozen specimen can be used to inseminate the eggs.  A separate specimen of semen is needed to freeze and it should not be produced until the cultures have been cleared.  You must schedule an appointment with the Andrology Lab for a semen freeze.
<li>
<B>If I had the Hysterosalpingogram (the X-Ray of the uterus and tubes) done before, do I need to repeat it?</b><br>
No, not unless the test was done many years prior or you had a surgical procedure since your last hysterosalpingogram.  Ask the IVF nurse if there are any questions.
<li>
<B>How do I know which doctor will be doing my retrieval and transfer?</B><br>
The IVF docotrs rotate for a period of time.  The rotation begins with Monday and ends with Sunday.
<li>
<B>How do I knwo what medication I will be taking and when to take it?</B><br>
During the IVF consult with the doctor, he/she will discuss with you the best medication stimulation protocol that you should be using.  An instruction sheet and prescriptions will be given to you.
<li>
<B>What should I do if I get my period, (cycle day 1), at night or on a weekend?</B><br>
you should leave your name, date and phone number on our answering machine, (609)751-3570.  If you need instructions or have questions, please ask us to return your call. We will call you back the next day.  If you need immediate instructions, you should call (609) 751-5575 and leave a message with the service to have the doctor return you call.
<li>
<B>If I do not know how to take the injectable medication, what should I do?</B><br>
You need to schedule a consult with an IVF nurse.  The person that will be giving you the medication should be present at the time of consult.  Generally these consults are best done between 2:00PM and 5:00PM, depending on the IVF schedule.
</OL><p>

<a name="during"></a>
B.  During the Egg Retrieval
<OL TYPE=1 START=1 COMPACT>
<li><b>How long does the egg retrieval take?<br></B>
Depending on the number of follicles that are present, the time may vary from one to one and one half hours.  You should plan on being at the IVF suite for a minimum of three hours.
<li><B>Is the egg retrieval a painful procedure?</B><br>
Generally, most patients are asleep during the procedure.  We usually administer Fentanyl an dVersed intravenously during the procedure.  These are very potent pain relievers and therefore most women tolerate the procedure with a minimum amount of discomfort.
<li><B>How will I feel after the egg retrieval?</B><br>
Usually patients compain of feeling sleepy.  Occasionally they will experience some abdominal discomfort.  The day after the egg retrieval some patients decide to return to work, which is fine if you feel well enough.  If you can afford the time off from work, we would encourage you to stay at home because you may not feel quite up to par.
<li><B>When is my male partner required to produce the semen specimen?</B><br>
On the day of egg retrieval, the Embryologist will inform you when the time is proper for you to produce.  We have private rooms available for your use.  If you have a specific problem, i.e., time constraints or difficulty producing, you should discuss this with an embryologist in advance of the egg retrieval.
<li><B>Does every follicle contain an egg?</B><br>
No. In fact, sometimes if the estradiol is very high it is difficult to see every follicle, so we may get many more eggs at time of retrieval than number of follicles seen on ultrasound.  Unfortunately, when the estradiol is low and only one or two follicles are present on ultrasound, there may not be an egg in the follicle.  This is called empty follicle syndrome.  We will prescan you prior to the egg retrieval if you have a small number of follicles present on ultrasound day of hCG.
 </OL>

<a name="after"></a>
C.  After the Egg Retrieval
<OL TYPE=1 START=1 COMPACT>
<li><B>Will every egg fertilize?</B>
<br>Our normal fertilization rate is approximately 65%.  Some patients have a much higher rate of fertilization and occasionally a few patients will unfortunately have no ferilization.  If you do not get 100% fertilization with the first day insemination, we will encourage the male partner to return to the IVF suite the next day to produce another semen specimen so that we may attempt to increase the number of fertilized oocytes (eggs).
<li><B>When are the embryos frozen?</B><br>
They can either be frozen the day after the egg retrieval, called the 2 Pronuclear stage, or the day of the ET or the day after that, if they appear normal.</OL>
<p>

<a name="transfer"></a>
D.  After the Embryo Transfer<br>

<OL TYPE=1 START=1 COMPACT>
<li><B>How long can embryos stay in frozen storage before being used?</B><br>
No one knows the exact answer to this question.  In our program, several women have delivered healthy, normal babies when the embryos were stored for 5 years in our laboratory.
<li><B>After my transfer, will all of my remaining embryos be frozen?</B><br>
Not all embryos go through normal cell division.  If the embryos do not appear normal, they will be discarded in the lab.  The Embryologist will call you 2-3 days after your transfer to tell you the total number of embryos that were frozen.  ALL EMBRYOS THAT LOOK NORMAL WILL BE FROZEN.
<li><B>When can I resume normal acitivities, i.e., driving, walking steps, going to work, etc.?</B><br>
48 hours after the transfer you may resume normal acitivity, unless you have a very strenuous job.  If your job is stenuous, you should discuss this with the doctor.
<li><B>When can I have sexual relations?</B><br>
There have not been any scientific studies done on this subject, but we think it is okay to resume normal sexual realtions after three days from transfer.
<li><B>What is the best position to stay in after the transfer?</B><br>
Lying flat in a bed or couch or reclining in a chair is best.  You may lie on your side or back, whcihever is more comfortable for you.  You should stay reclining except for using the bathroom and showering for 36 hours after the embryo transfer.
<li><B>On the drive home, must I lie flat?</B><br>
Because of the hazards of driving without a seat belt, we advise that you recline in the front seat, if possible, and put your seat belt on.
<li><B>If I live far away, should I stay in a hotel for two days after the transfer?</B><br>
If you live farther than two hours from the office, it would probably be best that you stay in a nearby hotel, at least the night of the embryo transfer.
<li><B>When can I resume strenuous exercise?</B><br>
You may resume strenuous exercise only with the consent of a physician and after you have had your pregnancy test.<br></OL>


We hope that these questions and answers will be helpful to you.  Or course, you should always call if you are unsure of the procedure.</FONT>

</HEAD><H3>Welcome to Cooper Center for In Vitro Fertilization Program</H3>
<font size=2>The information provided in this portion of the website is derived directly from our Patient Information Handbook.  You will find, herein, information concerning the In Vitro process:  the required preliminary testing, a description of the procedure, the risks and responsibilities of participants, and the andrology/embryology protocol.<p>

Our program began in 1988 at our<A HREF="locations.htm"> Melrose Park, PA</A> office.  In September 1990, we opened a new state of the art IVF laboratory in <A HREF="locations.htm">Marlton, New Jersey</A> and in November of 1991, we merged our two In Vitro Fertilization programs to form the Cooper Institute for IVF in Marlton, New Jersey.  In 1994, we reestablished the Program as the Cooper Center for In Vitro Fertilization, P.C.  We have been a member of The Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology, (SART), since 1989.  This society is an affiliate of the <A HREF="http://www.asrm.com.">American Society for Reproductive Medicine</A>.  SART's function is to set guidelines and monitor the pregnancy rate of its members in this new and growing field of In Vitro Fertilization.  We perform approximately 550 egg retrievals per year and are considered one fo the largest IVF programs in the United States.
<p>
We are affiliated with the <A HREF="http://www.umdnj.edu/">University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey</A>, and the<A HREF="http://www2.umdnj.edu/rwjms.html"> Robert Wood Johnson Medical School</A> at Camden.

<TITLE>IVF Patient Info</TITLE>
</HEAD><B>Patient Information</B><hr>

<FONT SIZE=2>We are very pleased to provide you with information concerning our In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) Program.  A brief overview of the IVF Program is described herein.  Additional information will be provided at the time of consultation.<p>
In addition to explaining the IVF/ET (Embryo Transfer) technique, this document describes the major significant and foreseeable risks of the procedures, possible alternatives to IVF/ET, if any, and the responsibilities of couples who participate in our IVF program.
<p><B><I>Introduction</I></B><br>
In order for pregnancy to occur, an egg has to be released from the ovary and unite with a sperm.  Normally this union, called fertilization, occurs within the fallopian tube.  When this process cannot take place in the body, it can be accomplished in the laboratory by using the <A HREF="ivf.htm">In Vitro Fertilization</A> (IVF) technique.  The technique, as currently practiced, involves uniting an egg(s) collected from a woman's ovary with sperm collected from her partner under laboratory conditions.  The resulting normal embryo(s) may be transferred to the uterus (womb) for continued growth.  The benefit of IVF and ET is that it gives a couple who may be unable to achieve a pregnancy an opportunity to attempt to overcome their infertility.  
<p>
<B><I>Who will benefit from IVF?</I></B><br>
<OL TYPE=1 START=1 COMPACT>
<li> IVF is of demonstrated value for patients with absence or blockage of the fallopian tubes.  IVF is also recommended to those where corrective surgery has either failed and/or is deemed inadvisable.<p>
<li>Couple with infertility related to severe male factor, e.g. lowered sperm counts or motility, antisperm antibodies, or hostile cervical mucus may also be assisted.<p>
<li>Those who have other causes of infertility such as endometriosis, unruptured follicle syndrome or who have unexplained infertility may also receive benefit.<p></OL>

<BR><hr>
<a name="consult"></a>
<p>
<B>IVF Consult:</B>  The IVF doctor will complete a history and physical examination at the time of consultation.  The IVF process and consent forms will be thoroughly reveiwed.  It is helpful to bring copies of your old medical records and hysterosalpingography films, if available.

<a name="mock"></a>
<p><B>Mock Transfer:</B>  A mock trnsfer should be done on a non-IVF cycle, days 1-9 of your cycle.  For the mock transfer, the physician inserts a tiny plastic catheter into the uterus.  This allows the physician to measure the depth and direction of your uterus.  You may experience some cramping during the procedure.  It is recommended that you take Ibuprofen (approximately 600 mgs) 1/2 hour prior to his procedure.  This will reduce the cramping.  if you cannot take Ibuprofen, take 2 Extra-Strenght Tylenol tablets instead.  You may schedule to have this performed at the time of your IVF consult or along with having cervical cultures.
<p>
<a name="eval"></a>
<B>Uterine Cavity and Fallopian Tube Evaluation</B>:  This can be accomplished by 1 of 3 methods:  Hysterosalpingogram (x-ray), Hysteroscopy (endoscopy) or Sonohysterography (ultrasound).  The Physician will determine which procedure is most appropriate for you.  Depending on the results,  you may need more than one type of testing.  The IVF physician will instruct yuo as to when to schedule the procedure.  if you have previously had a hysterosalpingogram or hysteroscopy the report and films should be reviewed by the physician.<p>

<a name="baseline"></a>
<B>Baseline Bloods:</B>  Serum estradiol, progesterone, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), and luteinizing hormone (LH) are to be drawn either day 2 or 3 of your cycle.  Leave your name and number for an IVF call back.  These blood results are helpful to the physician so that hte best IVF stimulation protocol (medication) will be chosen for you to complete your IVF cycle.<p>

<a name="semen"></a>
<B>Semen Freezing:</B>  Once the semen cultures are negative, make an appointment with the Andrology Lab in one of our offices, for a semen freeze appointment.  It is only necessary to freeze a specimen once before the first IVF cycle, unless we use it to inseminate your eggs and you choose to do another cycle.  There is a one time charge of $125 to freeze and sotre a sperm specimen.  This sample is used only as an emergency backup for the day of retrieval.  We prefer to inseminate the eggs with fresh sperm, if possible. 
<p>
<a name="process"></a>
<B>Sperm Processing Panel/ICSI Panel:</B>  After the emen analysis is performed, you will be told by the Andrology lab or a doctor, if the sperm count and/or motility are abnormally low.  in this case, you will be advised to make an appointment to have a Pre-IVF Sperm Processing Panel/ICSI Panel at the Marlton office.  This way, prior to the retrieval, we will have the opportunity to process the specimen and detemine the best method to use to obtain the maximum amount of motile sperm for inseminating the eggs.  It is your responsibility to make this appointment.  Please call the IVF or Andrology Labs if you have questions regarding the pre-IVF sperm processing panel.<p>
<p>
<a name="nurse"></a>
<B>Nursing Consult: </B> A consult with an IVF Nurse should be scheduled by those who need to learn how to administer the injectable medication for the IVF cycle.  There is a fee associated with injection instructions.  By day 1of the retrieval cycle, you should have all of your instructions and medications.  If you do not, you need to call an IVF Nurse.  The direct phone number to reach an IVF nurse is (609) 751-3570 or (215) 635-5518.

<a name="finance"></a>
<p><B>Financial Consult:</B>  Please schedule a consult with the Billing Department Staff to discuss your financial obligations.  A phone consult may be arranged at 1-(800)-752-1086 or (215)635-0877 for your convenience.

<a name="call"></a>
<p><B>Call Backs:</B>  IVF call backs will be made between 4:00PM - 7:00PM on weekdays and from 3:00PM - 6:00PM on Saturdays.  If you will NOT be home, then you must have a telephone answering machine so that we may leave a message regarding your instructions.  If you do not receive a call back by 7:00PM on weekdays or 6:00PM on Saturdays, please contact the answering service in the Marlton, NJ office at (609)751-5575 and ask to speak to the physician on call.

<a name="note"></a>
<p><B>A Personal Note: </B> The process of In Vitro Fertilization can be psychologically stressful.  Significan anxiety and disappointment may occur.  A substantial commitment of time by the couple is needed.  Some people have described the IVF experience as an emotional roller coaster.  The IVF staff of physicians and nurses are well aware of the added stress and burden that the In Vitro process can sometimes create.  We therefore, suggest that you consider joining a support group or participate in a therapy group to help you through this stressful period.  If you would like more information about a group you could join, call LuAnn Vanaman, R.N., C. at the New Jersey office, (609)751-5575.

<a name="local"></a>
<p><B>Location:</B>  The IVF Program is located at: <A HREF="locations.htm"> 8002E Greentree Commons, Marlton, NJ.</A>  The acutal egg retrievals and embryo transfers are done ONLY in the Marlton, NJ facility.  Please refer to the enclosed map for directions.</FONT>

<hr>
<a name="retreive"></a>
<FONT SIZE=2><b>Retrieval</b><br>
The means by which the egg collection process (retrieval) takes place is by using the transvaginal ultrasound-guided method.  The female partner is positioned on a comfortable examination bed.  A small intravenous (IV) catheter is inserted into her arm. An IV of dextrose, lactose and salt solution is then slowly infused.  A speculum is placed in the vagina and both vagina and cervix are cleansed with sterile water.  A vaginal ultrasound is performed to visualize the abdominal area.  An injection site is made through the back of the vaginal wall to the ovary with a needle.  The follicles are penetrated by the ultrasound-guided needle and suction applied to drain the follicular fluid.  This fluid is examined via microscope by the embryologist who will inform the team members of the presence of an egg.  The length of time for the procedure is influenced by the total number of follicles.  Average time for the retrieval is one hour.  
<p>
Some discomfort may be experienced during the actual egg retrieval; however, most patients sleep through the procedure.  Currently, we administer medications derived from the Morphine and Valium family of drugs by IV to achieve a "twilight sleep."  We can arrange for a nurse anesthetist to administer anesthesia during the egg retrieval.
<p>
There is an additional charge of $250.00.  A check should be made payable to Cooper Anesthesia Associates.  Payment is due the day of the retrieval.  Patients with concerns or questions about using this service should discuss them with the IVF staff.
<p>
The retrieval is considered an invasive procedure.  There is a risk of infection, internal and/or vaginal bleeding, and possible damage to internal organs.  The patient is monitored throughout the retrieval and recovery process and will be discharged after satisfactory evaluation by ultrasound examination.  The duration of the recovery period is generally one to two hours.
<p>
Prior to discharge, an antibiotic will be given as a preventative measure to decrease risk of infection.  Instructions will also be given regarding progesterone supplementation.  Intramuscular injections or oral capsules of the hormone progesterone will be started after the retrieval to aid in the implantation process.
<p>
<a name="sperm"></a>
<b>Sperm Collection and Insemination<br></B>
During the retrieval, the male partner will be notified by the embryologist to produce a fresh sperm sample by masturbation.  The specimen will be processed in our laboratory and prepared for egg insemination.  Only the identified partners sperm and/or the designated donors sperm will be used to inseminate the eggs obtained from the female partner.  If you have a frozen semen specimen, (as previously recommended), then that sample will be utilized as a back up, in case of emergency.
<p>
<a name="eggs">
<b>Incubation and Fertilization of Eggs<br></b> 
The eggs and sperm will be placed together in a special culture fluid and kept in incubators in our laboratory.  This process is called insemination.  The eggs will be examined 16-20 hours after insemination for signs of fertilization. If fertilization occurs, the fertilized eggs are now described as zygotes.  When they divide to at least 2 cells they are called embryos.  The laboratory environment is conducive for fertilization to occur, however, it cannot be guaranteed that fertilization will occur.  Our average fertilization is 60% per cycle.  This percentage may be higher or lower.
<p>
You will be contacted by the embryology staff the morning after the retrieval.  Information will be given regarding the status of the eggs, fertilization, and possible cryopreservation (freezing of embryos) at that time.  The male partner may need to be available not only the day of the retrieval, but also the day following.  A second sperm sample may be needed to reinseminate those eggs which have not fertilized as yet.</FONT>

</HEAD><H3>Factors &amp; Risks Associated with the IVF Procedure </H3><FONT SIZE=2><OL><a name="risks"></a>
<LI>Due to the nature of this procedure, which uses a metal needle
to remove the egg(s), there is potential risk of injury to other
organs: bladder, bowel, uterus, fallopian tube(s) or blood vessel(s).
A minor problem or a serious complication may develop (such as
internal bleeding and / or infection) which may require hospitalization
and / or further surgical intervention to correct the problem(s)
or to save life. This potential risk is less .1%. 
<LI>Pelvic scarring and / or technical problems may prevent recovery
of one or more eggs form the ovaries. 
<LI>There may be failure to recover an egg because ovulation has
occurred before the time or retrieval. 
<LI>One or more eggs may not be recovered on attempted aspiration
of the follicle. 
<LI>Laboratory conditions may arise which make it impossible or
impractical to proceed with in vitro fertilization at the time
that egg retrieval would otherwise be indicated. 
<LI>The eggs obtained may not be normal. 
<LI>The semen specimen produced may be of very poor quality, i.e.,
low count and motility, or it may not be able to be produced.

<LI>Appropriate laboratory processing of the sperm specimen may
be difficult or impossible. 
<LI>Fertilization of the eggs to form embryos may not occur. 
<LI>The embryos may not develop normally. If, in the physicians
best judgment, this occurs, efforts to continue growth of the
embryo(s) may be halted. When reasonably possible, this will take
place only after previous consultation with the patient and her
partner. Eggs or embryos which have failed to develop and are
therefore not viable will not be transferred. 
<LI>Embryo transfer into the uterus may be technically difficult
or impossible, due to unforeseen circumstances, or abnormal anatomy.

<LI>If transfer is performed, implantation(s) may not result,
(which is the most common cause). 
<LI>If implantation occurs, the embryo(s) may not grow or develop
normally. 
<LI>Equipment failure, infection, and / or human error or other
unforeseen factors may result in loss or damage to eggs, sperm
sample, and / or embryos. 
<LI>Follicles containing mature eggs may not develop in the monitored
cycle. This may prevent obtaining eggs, or may result in obtaining
immature eggs which will not fertilize.
<BR>
<p>Most infants who have been born following human in vitro fertilization have appeared normal at birth; animal offspring have usually been normal following in vitro fertilization and/or embryo transfer.  Yet, congenital abnormalities, birth defects, genetic abnormalities, mental retardation

These embryos are donted anonymously to the Cooper Center for IVF with the full knowledge that they will be transferred to a couple or person for the purpose of making them pregnant.  If available, a medical history is obtained from the donating couple.

<FONT SIZE=2>If you do not live in close proximity to any of our offices in Marton, NJ, Melrose Park, PA, Newark, DE or Bayonne, NJ, your daily monitoring may be done at an outside facility.  During an acutal treatment cycle, the female member of an IVF couple may have to be in teh Philadelphia/South Jersey area for up to one week prior to the egg retrieval, and until at least 3 days after the egg retrieval.  If an ultrasound and lab facility are available to you in your home town, then follicular maturation may be monitored there prior to the oocyte retrieval.  The ultrasound and lab facility you use must be able to provide same day results.  The results must be faxed to the Marlton office at (609) 751-7289 before 5:00PM daily.  There will be an out of town management fee of $165.00 per cycle to cover the expense of monitoring by telephone.  <p>
The male partner must be available the day of the egg retrieval, as well as the day after, so that anotehr semen specimen can be obtained.  This may be necessary for reinseminating the eggs.  The partner is usually present for the embryo transfer, which is performed on the third day after the retrieval. 
<p>
The normal ranges for blood tests vary from lab to lab, therefore, whenever possible it is best to use the Endocrine Testing Ltd. laboratory.  Please contact the lab at (215)635-4882 or (800) 6-ETL-ETL for instructions on how to mail specimens to the lab.  Nevertheless, for those patients that have a managed care insurance plan that requires the use of a specific lab, we can usually make the appropriate adjustments so that no additional financial burden will occur.</FONT>

<h4><b>On November 5, 1996, Californians will vote on a ballot initiative,
Proposition 215, that would permit seriously and terminally ill patients
to use marijuana in their medical treatment. If the initiative passes,
then patients, with a doctors approval, will be exempt from the states
criminal marijuana laws. This initiative will affect thousands of people
suffering from cancer, glaucoma, AIDS and other diseases who do not find
adequate relief from legally available medicines. Proposition 215 has similar
provisions to Senate Bill 1529, which passed the Assembly and Senate in
1995. Unfortunately, Governor Wilson vetoed the bill, his third veto of
the proposal in as many years.</b></h4>

<h4><b>As Republicans we believe the government should not interfere with
medication decisions between a patient and his or her physician. It is
a disgrace that thousands of people are denied the medication which their
doctors feel is an essential part of their treatment. Proposition 215 takes
such decisions out of the hands of politicians and bureaucrats and leaves
them in the hands of the medical experts. Proposition 215 is supported
by the <a href="http://www.norml.org/medical/sfdocs.endorse.shtml">American
Academy of Family Physicians</a>, the <a href="http://www.prop215.org/apha.html">American

<p><b>Excerpted from the <i>San Francisco Chronicle 
<br></i>Robert B. Gunnison, <i>Chronicle</i> Sacramento Bureau</b></p>

<p>Pollster Mervin Field also reported that Proposition 215, which would
legalize medical use of marijuana, recovered from a slip in support earlier
this month and is now favored by 59 percent of likely voters; 35 percent
oppose the measure, with 6 percent undecided.</p>

<p>MEDICAL MARIJUANA </p>

<p>With regard to Proposition 215, which would legalize use of marijuana
for medical purposes, Mark DiCamillo, managing editor of the poll, said
it appeals to two constituencies -- those who support use of marijuana
as an alternative drug and those who back legalization of any drugs. </p>

<p>He noted that support had dipped from 62 percent in September to 56
percent in early October, but had rebounded to 59 percent in the latest
survey. ``It seems to have stabilized,'' DiCamillo said. </p>

<p>The survey was conducted by telephone October 25-28 among 824 likely
voters in the general election. Field said that 95 percent of the time,
such a survey would have a sampling error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage
points, although that number could be larger for subgroups.</p>

<h2 align=center>Text of Introduction &amp; Rebuttal by Eric Garris, 
<br>Director of Republicans for Proposition 215, 
<br>in Debate with California Attorney General Dan Lungren </h2>

<p><b>Broadcast KSFO Radio October 31, 1996</b> </p>

<p>I would like to start with a quote from a well-known individual: (quote)
&quot;our outdated federal prohibition is depriving thousands of glaucoma
and cancer patients of medical care. We believe licensed physicians are
competent to employ marijuana, and patients have a right to obtain marijuana
legally, under medical supervision. The medical prohibition does not prevent
seriously ill patients from employing marijuana; it simply deprives them
of medical supervision. Physicians are forced to choose between their ethical
responsibilities to the patient and their legal liabilities to bureaucrats.&quot;
(unquote) Who do you think said this? Some liberal? No. These are the words
of Congressman Newt Gingrich in a letter he wrote in support of a bill
he introduced in 1981 to legalize medical marijuana. </p>

<p>I represent Republicans for Proposition 215, the medical marijuana measure
on next Tuesday's ballot. Our supporters include former U.S. Secretary
of State George Schultz, Nobel Prize winning economist Milton Friedman,
National Review Senior Editor Richard Brookhiser, former gubernatorial
candidate Ron Unz, Chris Norby, the Mayor of Fullerton, and dozens of local
Republican clubs who support Proposition 215. </p>

<p>We are Republicans in the tradition of Ronald Reagan. We support smaller
government, lower taxes, and less government regulation of business and
individual rights. As Republicans, we do not believe that medical policies
should be made by politicians and bureaucrats. </p>

<p>Proposition 215 will not legalize marijuana. Only licensed physicians,
as defined under state law, will be able to recommend marijuana to their
patients. Prop. 215 is meant to be an interim measure. First, it calls
on the Congress and State Legislature to enact and institutionalize a system
for providing marijuana for patients who have had it prescribed by their
doctors. Until this happens, it prevents the prosecution of patients who
use and grow marijuana for their own medical use. It protects doctors from
being prosecuted for advising their patients to use a drug they feel would
be the best treatment for their condition. </p>

<p>A Harvard University study conducted of members of the American Society
of Clinical Oncology found that almost half of Oncologists, cancer specialists,
have advised patients to use marijuana to counter the side effects of chemotherapy.
The Drug Enforcement Administration's own Law Judge, Francis Young, ruled
in 1988 that marijuana is an effective form of medicine for a variety of
ailments and that it should be legalized for medical purposes. The bureaucrats
at the DEA overruled Judge Young's decision. </p>

<p>Proposition 215 is supported by medical organizations representing 38,000
California doctors and nurses. The California Academy of Family Physicians,
the American Public Health Association, the California Nurses Association,
the California Nurses Alliance, the San Francisco Medical Society, and
the Los Angeles County AIDS Commission all endorse Proposition 215. Public
health officials from counties and cities all over the state have endorsed
215. The National Multiple Sclerosis Society of Northern California supports
Prop. 215. Kaiser Permanente, one of the largest HMOs in the state, recently
added smoking marijuana to their list of recommended medications which
should be administered to patients with AIDS wasting syndrome. </p>

<p>Prop. 215 is supported by Senior Citizens. The Older Women's League
of California, the Congress of California Seniors, the California Senior
Legislature, and the California Legislative Council for Older Americans
all support Prop. 215's passage November 5. Seniors support Proposition
215 because they are the most frequent sufferers of glaucoma, cancer, and
the other diseases treated by medical marijuana. </p>

<p>Proposition 215 is endorsed by all ten major Bay Area daily newspapers.
And the first newspaper in the state to endorse Prop. 215, before it even
qualified for the ballot, was the Orange County Register, the flagship
paper of conservative Republicans in Southern California. 
<br>
<br>
<br>Rebuttal </p>

<p>If Prop. 215 passes, California would not become the first state to
allow marijuana to be used by patients. Last year, Ohio passed a bill very
similar to Prop. 215, allowing patients to grow and use marijuana on the
advice of their doctors. If arrested and prosecuted, patients could defend
themselves by proving medical need--the same provision as in Prop. 215.
In addition, the Supreme Courts of Florida and Idaho recently ruled that
medical marijuana-using patients are exempt from criminal penalties. In
these three states, there has been no increase in marijuana use since the
laws have changed. Yet California continues to arrest thousands of people
who grow and use marijuana for their own medical purposes. </p>

<p>It could be worse. In Oklahoma, paraplegic James Montgomery is currently
serving a ten-year prison sentence for possession of two ounces of marijuana
he used to control seizures from his spinal cord injury. In Iowa, Jan Pleas,
mother of two with glaucoma, faces five years in prison for possession
of her medicine. Or the cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy given a
prescription for the huge, expensive, and often ineffective capsule known
as Marinol. These patients are so nauseous that they can't keep anything
down, and too broke to afford the $30,000 a year the drug costs. The worst
part is, a cheaper and more effective alternative exists. </p>

<p>Prop. 215 does not repeal any existing laws against the sale, use, or
cultivation of marijuana for non-medical purposes. Selling or growing marijuana,
driving under the influence of marijuana, or using marijuana for non-medical
purposes would still be a crime. In fact, police would be free to arrest
and prosecute anyone whom they feel is engaged in the improper use or distribution
of marijuana. Prop. 215 would allow medical necessity as a defense in court,
not against the power of police to conduct normal law enforcement duties.
It would be up to the courts to decide in each case, whether medical necessity
is a valid defense in that particular case. Prop. 215 calls upon Congress
and the State Legislature to implement a rational system for allowing sick
people to obtain the drug prescribed to them by their doctors. </p>

<p>The opponents of Prop. 215 will tell you that no study has shown the
efficacy of marijuana as medicine. This is simply not true. Scores of studies
have shown that marijuana is effective for a number of ailments, including
glaucoma, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, and for counteracting the nausea
caused by chemotherapy for cancer and AIDS. Even studies done by opponents
to prove their point have produced the opposite results. For example, in
1970, a study done at UCLA for the Los Angeles Police Department, intending
to show that marijuana damaged eyesight, instead showed that marijuana
reduced pressure within the eyeball. This led to the discovery that marijuana
is effective as a remedy for glaucoma. </p>

<p>In 1975, Doctor Donald Tashkin at UCLA Medical Center did a double-blind
scientific study on the effects of smoking marijuana to relieve acute bronchospasm
in asthma patients. The results, published in the American Review of Respiratory
Disease, stated &quot;the results appear to support the benefit ascribed
to the use of cannabis in the last century for the treatment of bronchial
asthma.&quot; Dr. Tashkin stated that unlike other medications which can
take 20 to 30 minutes to act, &quot;one toke of marijuana relieves an asthma
attack immediately.&quot; </p>

<p>In 1987, Republican Governor George Duekmejian appointed the California
Research Advisory Panel to conduct the Cannabis Therapeutic Research Study.
They performed rigorous testing with full scientific protocols and found
great benefit to chemotherapy patients smoking marijuana. Although this
study was funded by the state, the findings were suppressed. Had the State
of California submitted this study to the FDA it could have been used to
garner FDA approval for marijuana. But the politicians killed it, and the
new studies that need to get done are being stopped by political agendas.
Just last month, the federal government denied permission to the University
of California, San Francisco Medical Center to do a study on marijuana
and AIDS. In fact, the federal government has denied permission for every
study on the medicinal effects of marijuana proposed in the last fifteen
years. For the opponents to say that no federally-approved studies support
the proponents' arguments, while the federal government has refused to
sanction any studies, is disingenuous and classic government Catch-22.
It is typical bureaucratic double-speak.</p>

<h1 align=center>Proposition 215 Gaining
<br>in Latest Statewide <i>L.A. Times</i> Poll</h1>

<h2 align=center>Support Increases Five Percent in Month</h2>

<p>F<b>rom the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> -- October 25, 1996</b></p>

<p>Unlike Proposition 209, Proposition 215--the medical use of marijuana
initiative-is enjoying increasing support as the election draws near. Currently,
when given the ballot description, 58% of likely voters support Proposition
215 while 32% oppose it. In September, 53% of likely voters supported the
measure and 31% opposed it. </p>

<p>The medical use of marijuana initiative enjoys electoral support that
is both wide and deep. Substantial majorities of almost all electoral groups
in the poll support the measure. Even California's oldest voters (65 years
and older) and Republican voters support the measure by slim pluralities,
while conservatives are evenly split over the initiative: 45% in favor
and 46% opposed. </p>

<p>This measure is also the most well-known of the propositions included
in the poll, with only 22% of voters saying they had not heard enough about
the initiative to express an initial opinion. </p>

<p>The survey was conducted October 17th through 21st among 1,551 adult
respondents throughout the state, including 1,290 registered voters from
which 1,038 likely voters were determined. The survey was conducted October

<h1 align=center><b><font SIZE=+4>Yes on Proposition 215 </font></b></h1>

<center><p><b>by Richard Brookhiser
<br>Senior Editor, <i>National Review</i></b></p></center>

<p>I am a conservative Republican. The only reason I didn't vote for Barry
Goldwater was because I was nine years old at the time. But I started writing
for <i>National Review</i> when I was fourteen. I am for Proposition 215
because of my politics, not in spite of them. But I'm also for medical
marijuana because I've had to use it. </p>

<p>As a political journalist, I mark the milestones of my life by election
cycles. On the eve of Ronald Reagan's election I got married. On the eve
of Bill Clinton's I got testicular cancer. The treatment was straightforward-an
operation, followed by a rather harsh form of chemotherapy. Any chemotherapy
is harsh, because all chemotherapy is poison. You're dumping poison into
your bloodstream, killing millions of cells, in order to kill the thousands
of malignant cells, which will not recover. Because it is poison, the body
wants to get rid of it. That's why, chemotherapy causes nausea. To deal
with this, I took the latest anti-nausea drugs, including Zofran, and I
also did self-hypnosis and mental imaging. These all worked-up to a point.
But beyond that point, I needed extra help, and so I smoked marijuana.
</p>

<p>I had smoked marijuana maybe ten times in college, during the Seventies.
I even inhaled. I stopped because I found I didn't like smoke, or being
high, or the conversation of pot-heads. I turned to it when I got cancer
because marijuana gives people an appetite, and prevents people who are
nauseated from throwing up. None of my doctors or nurses at New York University
Medical Center, or Memorial Sloan-Kettering, discouraged me from doing
this. They had all had patients who had used marijuana to fight nausea,
and who had reported good results. I had good results too. Because of the
marijuana, my last two courses of chemotherapy were almost nausea-free.
</p>

<p>There was only one problem-I had to become a criminal to do this. </p>

<p>Cancer patients are not the only people in this bind. AIDS patients
who have the wasting syndrome report that marijuana gives them an appetite
again. Glaucoma patients find that it arrests the deterioration of their
eyes. People with chronic migraines, epilepsy, and multiple sclerosis use
it to relieve their symptoms. But any sick person who wants to use marijuana
to help himself, has to break the law. I'm a member of the media elite,
so I wasn't at high risk. But plenty of sick people get arrested, and plenty
of them go to jail. </p>

<p>There are three common arguments against the medical use of marijuana,
all of them faulty. </p>

<p>The first is that THC, the main active ingredient in the drug, is available
in a legally prescribed pill form. But the pill has problems. It's expensive.
Because it's a pill, and therefore slower acting, people have trouble adjusting
the dosage; they often find themselves taking too much. It all seems to
cause high levels of anxiety and depression. In my case, I thought treating
nausea with a pill was not a bright idea. </p>

<p>The second argument is that smoked marijuana has never been tested scientifically.
This is not entirely true. One test was done at UCLA in 1970 for the Los
Angeles Police Department, which wanted to prove that pot smoking dilated
the pupils. The researchers found that it actually contracted the pupils;
they also discovered that marijuana relieved pressure within the eyeball.
This is why marijuana is useful in treating glaucoma. </p>

<p>But it is true that it is difficult to test marijuana. That is because
the government makes it so. The case of Dr. Donald Abrams at San Francisco
General Hospital is instructive. Dr. Abrams is an AIDS researcher who wants
to test the efficacy of smoked marijuana in treating the wasting syndrome.
For more than two years, he tried to get marijuana legally from the National
Institute on Drug Abuse for his experiments-to no avail. So doctors cannot
prescribe marijuana because it hasn't been tested, but doctors aren't allowed
to do any tests. This is classic Catch-22. </p>

<p>The third objection is that by legalizing medical use of marijuana.,
we will be setting a bad example to a society engaged in a war on drugs.
In fact we will be setting no example at all. The availability of morphine
in hospitals is not the reason people smoke crack. A hairless cancer patient
with an IV tube in his arm is not a come-on for a pusher. </p>

<p>My support for medical marijuana is not a contradiction of my principles,
but an extension of them. I am for law and order. But crime has to be fought
intelligently, and the law disgraces itself when it harasses the sick.
I am for traditional values-I support the Christian Coalition, and I supported
the Moral Majority. But if carrying your beliefs to unjust ends is not
moral, it is philistine. Most important, I believe in getting government
off people's backs. We should include the backs of sick people trying to
help themselves. </p>

<p>My cancer is gone now; I was lucky. God forbid that anyone else should
ever need chemotherapy. But statistics tell us that many of us will. Let
me assure you that, whatever you think now, or however you vote, if that
moment comes to you, you will turn to medical marijuana. Please extend
that liberty to your fellow Californians by voting Yes on Proposition 215.

   <title>Former San Jose Police Chief Endorses Prop. 215</title>

<h1 align=center>Former San Jose Police Chief 
<br>Joseph&nbsp;McNamara Says Yes on Proposition 215</h1>

<p><b>By Joseph D. McNamara 
<br>October 20, 1996</b></p>

<p>I SPENT 35 years as a police officer and always believed that the majority
of cops cared about people and saw their jobs as a way to protect citizens
from harm and help them when they needed assistance. Thus, it saddens me
to see some cops in a knee-jerk response oppose letting doctors prescribe
medical marijuana for patients in agony from chemotherapy, glaucoma, or
a number of other illnesses for which marijuana seems to help. </p>

<p>Allowing doctors instead of cops to decide what is appropriate medicine
is logical. Under the present law, sick people or their families are forced
to become criminals in order to get a drug that can help them. In some
cases patients simply give up and lose the will to live. </p>

<p>Recently, I met Steve Kubby. Twenty years ago, doctors told him he had
cancer and could expect to die within four or five months. But Steve Kubby
is a fighter. He went into intensive treatment only to find that it made
him desperately ill and sapped his desire to live. He then began smoking
marijuana and now at age 48 is a successful businessman with a zest for
life. He still has cancer but marijuana helps him cope with the side-effects
of treatment. There are many such people. </p>

<p>If marijuana had not been made illegal in 1937, medical research could
have been done to determine just how useful it can be as medicine. </p>

<p>Because I became a policeman when I was 21, I never tried marijuana
and still haven't. But I see no reason to be hypocritical. It does not
turn users into demons. </p>

<p>Both President Clinton and Newt Gingrich tried marijuana without going
on to harder drugs and lives of crime. Indeed, most of the police officers
I hired during my 18 years as police chief admitted in their pre-employment
interviews that they had tried marijuana. It didn't keep them from becoming
fine police officers. </p>

<p>I do not advocate using marijuana, but it is not a drug that always
leads to violence or other crime. More than 70 million Americans have tried
marijuana and very few became habitual users or career criminals. Nor has
anyone ever died from using marijuana, unlike aspirin, alcohol, nicotine
and many other legal drugs. </p>

<p>Passage of Proposition 215 will not send a message leading more teenagers
to use marijuana. In the Netherlands, marijuana is freely available, and
the per capita teenage use of the drug is less than it is in the United
States. However, passing Proposition 215 will send a message that Californians
care about helping people cope with illnesses and don't want to turn them
into criminals because some police officer disapproves of their medicine.

<h2>EDITORIAL -- Vote Yes on Prop. 215 For Medical Marijuana </h2>

<p><font SIZE=+0>ILLEGAL RECREATIONAL marijuana use has been much in the
news lately; especially the widely publicized studies indicating that teenage
pot smoking is up all over the country and is at an all-time high in California.
</font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+0>We deplore kids using illegal drugs, and urge them to
stay clean. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+0>But Proposition 215 is not about playing with drugs. It
is a humane and commonsensical measure that would amend state law to allow
sick people and caregivers to grow or possess marijuana only for medical
use and only when recommended by their doctors. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+0>It would also prevent physicians from being punished for
recommending pot for medical purposes, just as they use other medicines,
including such powerful and useful drugs as morphine, codeine, Valium,
Librium and nitrous oxide, also known as ``laughing gas.'' </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+0>By any sensible standard, marijuana should be a welcome
addition to the pharmacopoeia of drugs used by California physicians, who
are trusted with all kinds of narcotics, sedatives and psychoactives that
can also be dangerous if improperly used. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+0>Many doctors and patients say smoking marijuana is helpful
in the treatment of such ailments as AIDS, glaucoma, arthritis, migraine
headaches, multiple sclerosis and spasticity. It also relieves the pain
of cancer and nausea associated with chemotherapy, alleviates chronic pain
and helps ward off asthma attacks, according to patients who have used
it. This is not to say that pot is a risk-free substance. Like many medicines,
marijuana has side effects, including the danger of lung disease from inhaling
hot smoke loaded with impurities and chronic impairment of cognitive skills
in heavy pot users. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+0>However, doctors and their patients would certainly be
capable of weighing the risks against the benefits and decide for themselves
if pot would be appropriate for the ailment to be treated. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+0>It is a sad commentary on our fatuous drug laws that,
as a practical matter, the only people unable to obtain marijuana are housebound
patients without an illegal drug connection and law-abiding citizens who
prefer to bear the pain and ravages of their illnesses rather than violate
the law. During two of the past three years, the state Legislature has
passed bills that would have allowed sick people to use marijuana as medicine.
But in a victory of puritanical politics over humane medicine, Governor
Wilson vetoed the bills each time. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+0>If marijuana eases the symptoms of disease and provides
solace to the severely sick -- as so many patients and their doctors insist
-- it should be legal to use as medicine. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+0>Vote yes on Proposition 215. It is a simple matter of
compassion and common sense. </font></p>

<h1><font SIZE=+4>Marijuana as medicine </font></h1>

<h1><font SIZE=+2>Why should it be different from other pain-relieving
drugs?
<br>Vote yes on Proposition 215</font><font SIZE=+1> </font></h1>

<p><font SIZE=+1>Look in the medicine cabinet of a person who suffers from
cancer, AIDS, glaucoma, spasticity or chronic pain: It's filled with dangerous
drugs. Doctors are allowed to prescribe these drugs -- including morphine
and cocaine -- despite the risk of abuse. Sick people are allowed to take
mind-altering drugs that would be illegal if used by the healthy. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>Except for marijuana. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>Californians should vote yes on Proposition 215, which
would let doctors recommend marijuana without fear of criminal prosecution,
and let sick people grow it and possess it, if recommended by a doctor.
</font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>Many doctors believe marijuana is highly effective in
relieving nausea and stimulating appetite -- important for cancer and AIDS
patients -- and in relieving pressure that blinds glaucoma patients. Marijuana
is also used to ease muscle spasms, and to help people manage chronic pain.
</font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>The ban on medical marijuana is &quot;scientifically,
legally and morally wrong,&quot; argues Dr. Lester Grinspoon, a Harvard
medical professor. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>In 1988, the Drug Enforcement Administration's chief administrative
law judge, Frank Young, recommended that doctors be allowed to prescribe
marijuana: &quot;It would be unreasonable, arbitrary and capricious for
the DEA to continue to stand between sufferers and the benefit of this
substance.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>Drug warriors persist in claiming that marijuana has no
medical value and they've blocked studies that might prove them wrong.
</font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>Doctors can prescribe Marinol, a pill containing THC,
the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana. However, patients can't tailor
the dose to their needs, because the capsule contains a liquid, and can't
be split. Because it's pure THC, Marinol can make patients so high they
can't function. For those with nausea, it's difficult to swallow a large
Marinol capsule, and keep it down. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>By contrast, patients can smoke as much or as little marijuana
as they need, getting the medical benefits with minimal psychoactive effects.
Those who don't like to smoke can eat marijuana cookies or brownies. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>The only real argument against letting sick people use
marijuana is that it might sanction the use of marijuana by people who
just want to get high. It's not a persuasive argument. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>Criminalizing medical marijuana hasn't stopped kids from
getting marijuana, or using it. Kids also abuse their parents' prescriptions
for tranquilizers and anti- depressants, and their friends' prescriptions
for Ritalin, but nobody's talking about making Prozac illegal because it
might be abused. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>Proposition 215 is on the ballot not because a few leftover
hippies from the '60s want to get high. It's there because thousands of
people with AIDS organized to fight for useful drugs. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>The initiative doesn't legalize marijuana use by healthy
people. It doesn't legalize &quot;engaging in conduct that endangers others.&quot;
Essentially, it lets law-abiding people seek relief from pain and illness
without feeling like criminals. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>Vote yes on Proposition 215. </font></p>

<h1><font SIZE=+4>Legalize marijuana for medicinal uses </font></h1>

<p><font SIZE=+1>With recent raids in San Francisco, law enforcement officials
have declared war on marijuana clubs. However, the war they have declared
is not on drug dealers and criminals, but on terminally ill patients who
use the substance as medicine.</font> </p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>Proposition 215 on the November ballot would take the
medicinal use of marijuana out of the confusing gray zone that allows the
political and criminal exploitation of sick people. The proposition would
allow seriously and terminally ill patients to use marijuana as a medical
treatment. Patients with a doctor's approval would be exempt from the state's
criminal marijuana laws. We support Proposition 215 as a human measure
that clearly delineates medicinal and recreational use of the substance.</font>
</p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>Patients suffering from cancer, glaucoma, arthritis, AIDS
and other debilitating illnesses have found relief from their pain when
they smoke marijuana.</font> </p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>Proposition 215 protects patients and doctors who currently
risk criminal prosecution for using, cultivating or prescribing the use
of marijuana for medicinal purposes.</font> </p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>Currently, there is no legal way for patients to get the
substance. They are forced to break the law to get relief.</font> </p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>The medicinal use of marijuana has received bipartisan
support in the state. In 1994 and 1995, both houses of the Legislature
passed bills allowing patients to use the substance as a medicine. The
bills were vetoed by Gov. Pete Wilson.</font> </p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>If opponents are concerned the proposition would make
recreational use of marijuana easier, they can stop worrying. Proposition
215 is even more narrowly defined than previous bills, focused only on
patients and their use of the substance.</font> </p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>In fact, other states have already taken this compassionate
step. In Florida, the state legislature recognized the medicinal value
of marijuana; the state Supreme Court there ruled that patients should
not be jailed for its use. Last year, Ohio created a special exemption
from marijuana laws for patients using the substance under a doctor's order.</font>
</p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>Proposition 215 is a compassionate measure that will allow
seriously and terminally ill patients to find some relief from their pain-under
a doctor's order. It does not promote drug use or weaken the laws prohibiting
it. Patients sick enough to need the substance should not have the additional
worry of being arrested or investigated by law enforcement.</font></p>

   <title>Fairfax Police Chief Support Medical Marijuana Initiative</title>

<h1 align=center>Marin County Police Chief
<br>Supports Medical Marijuana Initiative</h1>

<p><b>February 14, 1996, Fairfax, CA: </b>Jim Anderson, a long-time police
chief for the town of Fairfax is one of the latest law enforcement officials
to speak out in favor of California's current medical marijuana initiative.</p>

<p>&quot;I believe there is adequate unbiased and scientific evidence that
marijuana does have medicinal benefit. When we consider the associated
consequences of other prescription drugs it seems illogical to exclude
marijuana as another alternative available to physicians for prescription.
...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;... Even if there are no other benefits than relief of pain or
stimulation of appetite, there appears to be a legitimate place for marijuana
in the wide array of legally prescribed drugs. The legalization of marijuana
for medicinal purposes seems to strike a reasonable balance between the
abuse and illegal use of the drug and its legitimate medicinal value that
could be available through prescriptive use.</p>

<p>&quot;With the increased public attention on my own support of the medicinal
use of marijuana, I find that many other conservative persons share this
belief. ...Marijuana is not the street degenerate that ravages society.&quot;</p>

<p>Anderson has been employed in law enforcement and public safety since
1964 and has been a police chief for 14 years. He is also a member of the
U.S. Army Reserve with rank of Lieutenant Colonel.</p>

<h1 align=center><b>Text of Proposition 215</b></h1>

<center><p><b>The Compassionate Use Act of 1996</b> </p></center>

<p><b>INITIATIVE MEASURE TO BE SUBMITTED DIRECTLY TO THE VOTERS
<br>MEDICAL USE OF MARIJUANA. INITIATIVE STATUTE.
<br>
<br></b>Provides that patients or defined caregivers, who possess or cultivate
marijuana for medical treatment recommended by a physician, are exempt
from general provisions of law which otherwise prohibit possession or cultivation
of marijuana. Provides physicians shall not be punished or denied any right
or privilege for recommending marijuana to a patient for medical purposes.
Declares that the measure not be construed to supersede prohibitions of
conduct endangering others nor to condone diversion of marijuana for nonmedical
purposes. Contains severability clause. Summary of estimate by Legislative
Analyst and Director of Finance of fiscal impact on state and local government:
Because this measure restricts the use of marijuana to only those persons
for whom it is prescribed by a licensed physician, it would probably have
no significant state or local fiscal impact.
<br>
<br>To The Honorable Secretary Of State Of California:
<br>We, the undersigned, registered, qualified voters of California, residents
of __________________________County (or City and County), hereby propose
an addition to the Health and Safety Code, relating to the compassionate
use of marijuana, and petition the Secretary of State to submit the same
to the voters of California for their adoption or rejection at the next
succeeding general election or at any special statewide election held prior
to that general election or otherwise provided by law. The proposed addition
to the Health and Safety code shall read as follows:
<br>Section 1. Section 11362.5 is added to the Health and Safety Code,
to read:
<br>11362.5. (a) This section shall be known and may be cited as the Compassionate
Use Act of 1996.
<br>(b) (l) The people of the State of California hereby find and declare
that the purposes of the Compassionate Use Act of 1996 are as follows:
<br>(A) To ensure that seriously ill Californians have the right to obtain
and use marijuana for medical purposes where that medical use is deemed
appropriate and has been recommended by a physician who has determined
that the person's health would benefit from the use of marijuana in the
treatment of cancer, anorexia, AIDS, chronic pain, spasticity, glaucoma,
arthritis, migraine, or any other illness for which marijuana provides
relief.
<br>(B) To ensure that patients and their primary caregivers who obtain
and use marijuana for medical purposes upon the recommendation of a physician
are not subject to criminal prosecution or sanction.
<br>(C) To encourage the federal and state governments to implement a plan
to provide for the safe and affordable distribution of marijuana to all
patients in medical need of marijuana.
<br>(2) Nothing in this act shall be construed to supersede legislation
prohibiting persons from engaging in conduct that endangers others, nor
to condone the diversion of marijuana for nonmedical purposes.
<br>(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no physician in this
state shall be punished, or denied any right or privilege, for having recommended
marijuana to a patient for medical purposes.
<br>(d) Section 11357, relating to the possession of marijuana, and Section
11358, relating to the cultivation of marijuana, shall not apply to a patient,
or to a patient's primary caregiver, who possesses or cultivates marijuana
for the personal medical purposes of the patient upon the written or oral
recommendation or approval of a physician.
<br>(e) For the purposes of this section, &quot;primary caregiver&quot;
means the individual designated by the person exempted under this act who
has consistently assumed responsibility for the housing, health, or safety
of that person.
<br>Sec. 2. If any provision of this measure or the application thereof
to any person or circumstance is held invalid, that invalidity shall not
affect other provisions or applications of the measure which can be given
effect without the invalid provision or application, and to this end the
provisions of this measure are severable.</p>

<h2 align=center>** NEWS **
<br>From Congressman Brian Bilbray </h2>

<p>
<br>For Immediate Release: March 28, 1996
<br>Contact: Melissa Dollaghan (202) 225-2040
<br></p>

<h2 align=center>Bilbray Co-Sponsors Bill
<br>to Allow Medical Use of Marijuana </h2>

<p>Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brian Bilbray co-sponsored a bill to
permit doctors to prescribe tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) for the alleviation
of pain and nausea for seriously ill patients this week. </p>

<p>&quot;Doctors should be given the latitude to prescribe this for any
medicinal uses to the patients who would benefit in their judgement,&quot;
Bilbray said. &quot;We should not tie the hands of those who we charge
with healing and alleviating pain; if marijuana is the best prescription
for the seriously ill, doctors should be allowed to prescribe it.&quot;
</p>

<p>The legislation, H.R. 2618, reclassifies marijuana from a Schedule I
to a Schedule II substance under the Controlled Substance Act to recognize
the fact that there are valid and important medicinal uses of marijuana.
Schedule I drugs are those which have &quot;no currently accepted medical
use in the treatment in the United States,&quot; while Schedule II drugs
have a &quot;currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United
States.&quot; </p>

<p>Many doctors have concluded that marijuana is the best treatment for
the alleviation of pain for people with cancer, AIDS, glaucoma, spastic
disorders and other debilitating illnesses. </p>

<p>The legislation sets up a strict regime for assuring both the availability
of the legal marijuana for certain enumerated uses, and the existence of
strong controls to minimize the abuse of the marijuana supply. However,
pharmacies and physicians would be registered by the Federal Government
and certified to distribute the marijuana for narrow permissible uses,
and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) would be responsible
for the proper distribution of the marijuana itself. Further, HHS is directed
to set a price for the marijuana which will pay for the production and
distribution of the marijuana. </p>

<p>Dr. Lester Grinspoon, Harvard Medical School professor, said that &quot;cannabis
stands out among medicines as a safe and as an effective treatment for
a wide range of symptoms. It appears to be the best drug available to treat
the nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy, to control
the nausea from AIDS or the drugs used to treat it. The list goes on. Marijuana
is not a perfect drug in that it won't work for all patients, but it is
a major step forward when doctors and patients can exercise the choice
to use marijuana, especially when nothing else in the pharmacopoeia works.&quot;
</p>

<p>Bilbray joins the 14 other co-sponsors of the legislation. </p>

December 16, 1994 
<menu>
<h1 align=center><b>Conservative Columnist William F. Buckley, Jr.,
<br>Writes of His Sister's Cancer Chemotherapy
<br>and Her Need for Medical Marijuana</b> </h1>
</menu>

<p>In his syndicated column distributed on December 16, William F. Buckley,
Jr., the conservative author and talk show host, writes about his younger
sister's cancer and her need for medical access to marijuana &quot;because
she is undergoing an agonizing jolt of chemotherapy.&quot; To the question,
&quot;How does she know cannabis would help her?&quot; Buckley responds
- &quot;Dumb question. A) She knows, or knows of, people who have had relief
from the wretchedness she suffers from, from a puff or two of marijuana;
and B) so what if it did not work? ... What are we afraid of, that while
recovering from cancer and taking a marijuana cigarette she will become
a crack addict?&quot; </p>

<p>One of the persons she knows who has written about his use of cannabis
for chemotherapy is Richard Brookhiser, a senior editor of Buckley's National
Review magazine. As Buckley notes, Brookhiser found that it takes only
a one or two puffs on a marijuana cigarette to stop immediately-the nausea
of chemotherapy. It usually works, but if it does not, there are no side
effects. In contrast, the very expensive anti-nausea pharmaceutical Zofran
causes headaches in as many as 40% of those who use it and can cause liver
damage, etc. Yet the narcocracy cites Zofran as the reason that there is
no need for medical marijuana. </p>

<p>Buckley also writes of his frustration in not knowing where to buy marijuana
himself in New York City ... where it is almost ubiquitous. This reflects
one of the sad ironies of people in his situation: the older a person is,
the harder it is to find marijuana. The prohibition that is justified on
the grounds that it protects children actually makes it most difficult
for adults, and especially for the ill, to find marijuana when they need
it most. </p>

<p>In any other context it might be amusing to think of someone as recognizable
as Buckley lurking around Washington Square trying to &quot;score&quot;
a few dollars worth of pot. He makes light of this problem, but it really
is not feasible for someone in his position to do what he otherwise would
do. One assumes that at least after this column is published - the Buckleys
will eventually get marijuana, but what of the hundreds of thousands of
others? He laments that &quot;thinking on the subject is so far gone in
putrefaction that the simplest questions go unanswered.&quot; Actually,
most of the putrefaction starts here in Washington. Surveys show that the
overwhelming majority of the American people are in favor of medical access
to marijuana. Newt, please note. </p>

<p>Buckley concludes his column by reporting that researchers in San Francisco
have been ready for two years to do a study of the use of marijuana &quot;in
treating the wasting syndrome associated with AIDS, but they cannot obtain
the necessary marijuana from the government.&quot; Buckley asks, &quot;If
somebody discovered that marijuana would *cure* AIDS, would the narcs still
prowl the street for vendors?&quot; </p>

<p>Yes. Absolutely. NORML's experience suggests that the narcs would redouble
their efforts. They know that the survival of the narcocracy depends on
the suppression of medical marijuana. This is no petty crime that the narcs
are covering up ... as anyone who has endured chemotherapy, or AIDS, or
so much other suffering, would tell us, if they did not have to live and
often die in fear. </p>

<h1 align=center>Newt Gingrich's Support
<br>for Medical Marijuana </h1>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>The following letter by Rep. Newt Gingrich (R-Ga, now
Speaker of the House) in support of medical access to marijuana originally
appeared in the March 19, 1982 issue of the <i>Journal of the American
Medical Association (JAMA)</i>. </font></b></p>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>To the Editor, </font></b></p>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>The American Medical Association's Council on Scientific
Affairs should be commended for its report, &quot;Marijuana: Its Health
Hazards and Therapeutic Potential&quot; (1981;246:1823). Not only does
the report outline evidence of marijuana's potential harms, but it distinguishes
this concern from the legitimate issue of marijuana's important medical
benefits. All too often the hysteria that attends public debate over marijuana's
social abuse compromises a clear appreciation for this critical distinction.
</font></b></p>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Since 1978, 32 states have abandoned the federal prohibition
to recognize legislatively marijuana's important medical properties. Federal
law, however, continues to define marijuana as a drug &quot;with no accepted
medical use,&quot; and federal agencies continue to prohibit physician-patient
access to marijuana. This outdated federal prohibition is corrupting the
intent of the state laws and depriving thousands of glaucoma and cancer
patients of the medical care promised them by their state legislatures.
</font></b></p>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>On September 16, 1981, Representatives Stewart McKinney
and I introduced legislation designed to end bureaucratic interference
in the use of marijuana as a medicant. </font></b></p>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>We believe licensed physicians are competent to enploy
marijuana, and patients have a right to obtain marijuana legally, under
medical supervision, from a regulated source. The medical prohibition does
not prevent seriously ill patients from employing marijuana; it simply
deprives them of medical supervision and denies them access to a regulated
medical substance. Physicians are often forced to choose between their
ethical responsibilities to the patient and their legal liabilities to
federal bureaucrats. </font></b></p>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Representative McKinney and I hope the Council will
take a close and careful look at this issue. Federal policies do not reflect
a factual or balanced assessment of marijuana's use as a medicant. The
Council, by thoroughly investigating the available materials, might well
discover that its own assessment of marijuana's therapeutic value has,
in the past, been more than slightly shaded by federal policies that are
less than neutral. </font></b></p>

<h1 align=center>Statement by Judge James P. Gray,
<br>Orange County Superior Court </h1>

<p><font SIZE=+1>To Republicans for Proposition 215:</font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>Thank you for your work on the important Medical Marijuana
Initiative. I regretfully must decline to take an active role in this campaign
because I do not believe that an active judge should be involved even in
quasi political matters. However, I certainly will vote for your initiative,
and recommend that others do the same. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>If it will help, you may certainly use the following quote
from me as a part of your efforts: </font></p>

<dd><font SIZE=+1>It is a crime not to allow a medical doctor to be able
to prescribe appropriate medicine to a patient who is suffering from a
disease or who is in pain. For those people who at this time do not agree
with that statement, maybe it would help for them to ask themselves the
following question: &quot;If you had a loved one who was nauseous from
dosages of chemotherapy, or who had a loss of appetite form AIDS, or who
suffered from glaucoma, would you rather that his or her medication was
prescribed by a medical doctor or by a policeman?&quot; I believe this
to be an easy question to answer. </font></dd>

<p><font SIZE=+1>Again, I wish you the best of fortune as you pursue the
passage of this initiative, and if I may be of further assistance, please
feel free to call on me. </font></p>

   <title>Governor Weld Signs Medical Marijuana Law</title>
   <meta name="GENERATOR" content="Mozilla/2.01Gold (Win32)">

<body text="#000000" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0000EE" vlink="#551A8B" alink="#FF0000">

<h1 align=center>Governor Weld Signs
<br>Medicinal Marijuana Law</h1>

<p>A new medicinal marijuana bill was signed into law by Massachusetts
Governor William Weld on August 8. The bill, H.&nbsp;2170, was carefully
tailored by the legislature to address Governor Weld's objections to a
similar bill passed in late 1995, which Weld had refused to sign into law.</p>

<p>Massachusetts activists diligently lobbied for a bill that would allow
patients arrested on marijuana charges to use the affirmative defense of
&quot;medical necessity&quot; in court. Several state supreme courts have
recognized this defense, accepting that it is permitted under common law.
Others, including Massachusetts, refuse to allow this defense. In 1991,
the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruled that the societal harm of
allowing the necessity defense would be greater than the harm done to a
patient denied the opportunity to offer the defense.</p>

<p>The 1995 bill would have rectified the matter by establishing the defense
through legislation. However, the governor sent the bill back to the legislature,
arguing that it was too broad and likely to be abused.</p>

<p>The new law, therefore, is much more limited. It expands upon a law
signed by Governor Weld in 1991 which provided for the creation of a medicinal
marijuana therapeutic research program. Such programs operated in several
states in the late 1970s and early 1980s, providing marijuana to patients
who met certain medical criteria. Though officially &quot;research&quot;
programs, data were seldom analyzed and published: The programs served
mainly as a compassionate way for a few state governments to circumvent
the federal government's prohibition of medicinal marijuana.</p>

<p>The new Massachusetts law would allow patients to use the necessity
defense, but only if they are &quot;certified to participate&quot; in the
therapeutic research program and possessed the marijuana &quot;for personal
use pursuant to such program.&quot;</p>

<p>This hardly establishes a meaningful necessity defense: First, it is
unimaginable that a patient receiving marijuana as part of this program
would ever be arrested -- much less prosecuted and convicted -- for marijuana
possession, even without a codified medical necessity defense. Second,
the state public health department failed to launch a program during the
five years since the research program law took effect! Presently, there
is no such program running in Massachusetts.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, in addition to the message it sends that marijuana is
a useful medicine for some people, the new law will be beneficial for two
reasons: </p>

<ol>
<li>It raises the possibility that the courts may accept a defense of medical
necessity for a broader pool of patients -- for example, patients who meet
the criteria for the program but are not yet enrolled because the program
has not started running or because they did not know about it. 
<br>
<br></li>

<li>It contains a provision mandating that, within 180 days, the state's
public health department should establish the rules and regulations necessary
to get the program running. Within a year, hundreds of people suffering
from cancer, glaucoma, or asthma (but not AIDS or other unspecified ailments)
may be legally using marijuana in Massachusetts.</li>
</ol>

<p>The department must also explore the various ways of obtaining a supply
of marijuana to provide the patients.</p>

<p>There are four potential legal sources of marijuana for a state to use
for research purposes: importing it (from the Netherlands), receiving it
from the National Institute on Drug Abuse, getting permission from the
federal government to grow its own, or using confiscated marijuana.</p>

<p>Each of these options carries its own difficulties. During the next
few months, the Marijuana Project Project will be advising Massachusetts
officials on how best to obtain a legal source of marijuana so that its
research program can start providing marijuana to patients in need.</p>

<h1><font SIZE=+4>Marijuana merits medical use</font> </h1>

<p><font SIZE=+1>Last year Gov. Pete Wilson made a mistake when he vetoed
a bill that would have allowed doctors to prescribe marijuana for patients
suffering from cancer, AIDS, glaucoma and a few other diseases. This year
the Assembly erred in failing to pass the same measure. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>Fortunately, voters will have a say on the matter because
an initiative is likely to be on the November ballot. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>The initiative does not legalize marijuana. It simply
allows medical doctors to use it to relieve suffering. Increasingly, physicians
are speaking out in favor of marijuana for numerous conditions. The drug
helps AIDS patients avoid weight loss and eases vomiting and pain associated
with chemotherapy. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>The California Medical Association has expressed support
for the use of marijuana if controlled studies prove it works. However,
such studies can take place only if the law allows them. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>Opponents of medical use of marijuana say it puts out
a message that the drug is harmless. That's nonsense, not worthy of consideration
by anyone interested in helping sick people. That's like concluding morphine
is considered harmless because it is prescribed by physicians. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>But the arguments sounded good enough to Assemblyman Richard
Rainey, who changed his vote from yes to no on the marijuana bill. Let's
hope the voters have more sense and allow doctors to use the drug where
and when it can do some good. </font></p>

<h2>EDITORIAL -- Busting the Cannabis Club </h2>

<p><font SIZE=+0>FOR THE PAST five years, the Cannabis Buyers' Club in
San Francisco has openly sold marijuana to people with serious illnesses
and local law enforcement officials have averted their gaze, humanely allowing
it to operate without harassment. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+0>In fact, this enlightened community has all but decriminalized
the use of marijuana for medical purposes and does not want or need the
heavy hand of state Attorney General Dan Lungren to enforce his puritanical
anti-drug notions that defy common sense. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+0>Nonetheless, Lungren on Sunday dispatched state drug enforcement
agents for a high-profile bust of the Market Street pot emporium. The attorney
general's critics accuse him of making political hay by demonstrating his
tough anti-drug stance at the expense of some 11,000 club members. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+0>The issue is not about recreational drug use. The pot
club was a place where sick people, without an illegal drug connection,
were able to purchase the weed that they say provides relief from the agonies
of cancer, AIDS and many other diseases. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+0>It is a pity that Lungren cannot mind his own business,
and let San Francisco handle the local use of marijuana as medicine. </font></p>

<h2>EDITORIAL -- Puritanical Prejudice Vs. Medical Science </h2>

<p><font SIZE=+0>FOR THE THIRD YEAR in a row, the state Legislature has
passed a humane bill that would allow seriously ill patients to use marijuana
for medicinal purposes. Unfortunately, Governor Wilson is expected to veto
it, also for the third time. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+0>By any reasonable standard, marijuana should be a welcome
addition to the pharmacopoeia of drugs for treatment of such dreadful diseases
as glaucoma, cancer, AIDS and multiple sclerosis. After all, physicians
are allowed to prescribe morphine and scores of other narcotics to reduce
pain; they, too, can be abused if used improperly. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+0>The measure, authored by Assemblyman John Vasconcellos,
D-San Jose, provides a criminal defense for individuals who grow or possess
marijuana for medical purposes when approved in writing by a licensed physician.
</font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+0>The response from Wilson's office was prompt. ``This bill
will be vetoed by the governor,'' said spokesman Jesus Arredondo. ``The
Clinton administration said in August marijuana should not be legalized
for any purpose.'' </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+0>Is this the sorry common ground, where Republican Wilson
and Democrat Clinton can agree to promote their anti-drug policies at the
expense of the painfully sick? </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+0>Here is a clear example of puritanism and politics taking
precedence over sound medical practice and common sense. If medically prescribed
pot provides comfort to terminal patients or relieves the agony of people
in extreme pain -- and many users suffering from disease say it does --
who can fairly deny them their solace? </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+0>``In a free society, people who are ill shouldn't be made
criminals to alleviate their pain. Wilson is engaging in the politics of
pain,'' said an angry Vasconcellos. Sadly, perhaps the only people who
can not obtain marijuana are housebound patients without an illegal drug
connection and good citizens who would rather bear the pain, discomfort
and nausea of their illnesses rather than violate the law. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+0>Many physicians advise their patients to smoke marijuana,
anyway. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+0>Dr. Lester Grinspoon, of Harvard Medical School, believes
that marijuana will someday be hailed as a safe, inexpensive and versatile
miracle drug. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+0>In his writings, Grinspoon reports that smoking marijuana
can relieve nausea associated with chemotherapy, prevent blindness induced
by glaucoma, serve as an appetite stimulant for wasting AIDS patients,
act as an anti-epileptic, ward off asthma attacks and migraine headaches,
alleviate chronic pain and reduce the muscle spasms that accompany some
diseases. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+0>Until sanity and humanity prevail in Sacramento and Washington,
law-abiding patients will be denied this drug that might relieve their
suffering. What a pity. </font></p>

<h2>EDITORIAL -- Marijuana as Medicine </h2>

<p><font SIZE=+0>WHAT A SENSE of justice and relief many AIDS, cancer,
glaucoma and multiple sclerosis patients felt last year when both houses
of the state Legislature passed a bill allowing them to use marijuana to
ease their pain and nausea. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+0>Some otherwise law-abiding citizens already had been using
the illegal weed to combat the ravages of their diseases. Others were aware
of the helpful effects of pot and wanted to try it but could not bring
themselves to defy laws against marijuana use and possession. When both
the state Senate and Assembly approved the medicinal marijuana measure
by Senator Milton Marks, D-S.F., both groups expressed gratitude. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+0>But their victory was short-lived. Despite its legislative
approval after substantive hearings, Governor Wilson vetoed the bill. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+0>Let us hope that in this non-election year, compassion
and good sense rule and that an identical measure, by Assemblyman John
Vasconcellos, D-San Jose, passes and, this time, is signed by Wilson. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+0>The Assembly did the right thing last week by approving
the measure. Now it is up to the Senate and the governor to provide the
opportunity for relief from suffering for many patients for whom marijuana
controls nausea caused by anti-cancer and anti-AIDS drugs, lowers eye pressure
caused by glaucoma and reduces muscle spasms and pain related to multiple
sclerosis. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+0>The measure is narrowly drawn and would not change laws
against marijuana possession and use for the general public. It simply
would allow suffering patients -- with doctor approval -- to possess or
cultivate marijuana for personal use. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+0>Several medical studies have shown marijuana does ease
pain and nausea for many patients. Recognizing this, a number of communities
have chosen to look the other way when known cancer -- and other -- patients
grow pot. But neither the patients nor law enforcement should be forced
to disobey the law to provide medical relief. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+0>The patients' hopes were raised, then dashed, last year.
A repeat of that cruel outcome is not acceptable. </font></p>

<h1 align=center>Medical Marijuana: Aid to Infirm
<br>or Vague Loophole in Narcotics Laws? </h1>

<p><font SIZE=+1>By MARK EVANS
<br>Associated Press Writer</font> </p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Jim Scott's morning routine rarely
varies. First, a cup of coffee. Next, a dose of lithium, to treat his manic
depression.</font> </p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>Then a tightly rolled cigarette, packed with the cheapest
marijuana he can find.</font> </p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>The 50-year-old San Franciscan repeats the ritual at noon,
at dinner-time, and late at night, smoking three more joints, each precisely
measured at 1 gram. He falls asleep stoned.</font> </p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>``This controls my anger,'' Scott says, gesturing with
an unlit joint clasped in his left hand. ``It helps me keep my balance.''</font>
</p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>The only variable in Scott's daily routine is the availability
of his pot, which he's forced to find illegally, through friends or on
the streets. That's why he is actively campaigning for Proposition 215,
a ballot measure which would permit people to grow and use the drug for
certain medical purposes.</font> </p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>To its supporters, Proposition 215 is a long-overdue measure
that would help seriously ill people cope with pain and disease. But to
opponents, it is a cleverly shrouded hoax that uses ailing people as pawns
in a broader battle to legalize a dangerous drug.</font> </p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>``The pro-marijuana lobby has made no bones about the
fact they want to legalize marijuana. The way to do that, they have decided,
is through medical marijuana,'' said Tom Gorman, spokesman for the California
Narcotics Officers Association. ``It's unfortunate they're using sick people
to get what they want. It's exactly what they (the infirm) don't need.''</font>
</p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>Gorman says the proposition provides no controls on quality
or dosage of marijuana. And, he notes, a synthetic form of marijuana known
as Marinol already is available by prescription.</font> </p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>Moreover, Gorman says, under Proposition 215 a doctor's
``prescription'' for marijuana could amount to no more than an informal
verbal statement, making it difficult to track who legally is entitled
to the drug.</font> </p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>``If I were a (marijuana) grower, I would get a doctor's
permission somehow. I'd say I have a headache or a backache. Or pick a
doctor who was deceased. If I got busted, I could say I had permission,''
Gorman says.</font> </p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>Drug dealers are smart, he says, and will find ways to
exploit every loophole in the initiative. Enforcing existing laws against
marijuana would amount to ``an absolute mess,'' if the measure passes,
he says.</font> </p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>Despite Gorman's skepticism and a medical community that
remains divided on the issue, there are many who swear the drug helps them:
Cancer patients say it has helped them fight the nausea that follows chemotherapy
treatment. AIDS patients recount how it helps their appetite, allowing
them to stave off the ``wasting'' effects of the disease. Glaucoma patients
say it helps reduce pressure in the eyes.</font> </p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>And then there are people like Scott, who claim four joints
a day help him wrestle with insanity.</font> </p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>``I know what I'm like without it,'' says Scott, whose
mood swings have landed him in jail or mental hospitals dozens of times.
``I'm down on Market Street, yelling uncontrollably, yelling very loudly
at the shopkeepers.''</font> </p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>The debate over medicinal marijuana is nothing new in
California. State lawmakers approved similarly worded measures in 1994
and 1995, but Gov. Pete Wilson vetoed both.</font> </p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>``This is probably our toughest fight,'' said Orange County
Sheriff Brad Gates, a longtime opponent of efforts to legalize the drug.
``It's on the ballot, and we have to deal with it. But I don't think it
will pass.''</font> </p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>Recent polls, however, show strong voter support. A Los
Angeles Times survey last month showed voters favoring the initiative,
53 percent to 31 percent. A Field Poll gave it a 2-to-1 margin of victory-although
it found only half the voters were aware the measure was on the ballot.</font>
</p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>Opponents say the apparent support may simply come from
people who don't completely understand the initiative.</font> </p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>``It's a scam,'' says Sharon Rose of Californians For
Drug-Free Youth. ``I read the initiative to people and they flip (their
opinion). The way it's written, it's deceptive.''</font> </p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>But Jeffrey Reed, a 40-year-old registered nurse, says
the only deception is in anti-drug rhetoric which lumps marijuana together
with much more dangerous narcotics.</font> </p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>``We're talking about a herb that's been used to heal
since time immemorial,'' Reed says.</font> </p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>Reed, diagnosed with AIDS in 1988, says he discovered
the drug's curative powers a couple years ago and has been spreading the
word ever since.</font> </p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>``I think we're at a turning point,'' he says. ``Finally,
we're getting to decide whether the attorney general and a bunch of police
can decide what's medicine-or whether to leave that decision to our doctors.''</font></p>

<h2>PATIENT'S FRIENDS PROTEST POT RAID
<br>SUPPORTERS: MARIJUANA COMFORTS QUADRIPLEGIC 
<br></h2>

<p>Friends of a Santa Cruz quadriplegic who says he uses marijuana to calm
debilitating muscle spasms protested a recent raid on his apartment during
Tuesday's meeting of the Santa Cruz County Board of Supervisors.</p>

<p> ''You've got to protect him from the people you've given money to,''
one speaker told supervisors, pointing to their financial support of marijuana
eradication operations of the sheriff's department.</p>

<p> The speaker, who called herself ''No Guns,'' told board members that
quadriplegic Scott Hager ''was knocked off his wheelchair'' by a narcotics
agent who proceed ed ''to make fun of him'' during a raid at Hager's apartment
July 30.</p>

<p> Not arrested</p>

<p> Hager, 35, wheelchair-bound since breaking his neck in a diving accident
in 1982, was unable to attend the supervisors' meeting because, said his
friends, of injuries he received during the raid.</p>

<p> Hager, who has been active in the Santa Cruz medical marijuana movement,
was not arrested after sheriff's deputies raided his apartment. A sheriff's
spokesman said the matter had been referred to the district attorney's
office.</p>

<p> But, said sheriff's Sgt. Rich Ross, 163 marijuana plants and what the
deputy described as ''a sophisticated growing system'' were confiscated.</p>

<p> Medical remedy claims</p>

<p> Hager, who contended almost 100 of the plants were marijuana seeds
that had only sprouted the morning of the raid, also said he grew the plants
for his own use. He said he uses the illegal weed not only to stop his
convulsive muscle spasms but also to stimulate his appetite and as a sleeping
aid. He said he gives plants he doesn't use to the Santa Cruz Cannabis
Buyers Club or to other organizations that provide marijuana to patients
for medicinal purposes.</p>

<p> Major uses of marijuana for medical purposes include fighting the nausea
experienced during chemotherapy and helping stop weight loss caused by
cancer and AIDS.</p>

<p> Hager said he was considering legal action against the sheriff's officer
whom he accused of knocking him ''out of my wheelchair, so that I ended
up flat on my face and being mocked as I lay there.''</p>

<p> He said he doubted whether there was any connection between his case
and the recent raid on a medical marijuana supply operation in San Francisco.</p>

<p> About 50 supporters of the use of marijuana for medicinal purposes
attended Tuesday's board of supervisors meeting.</p>

<p> Aside from protesting Hager's treatment, they urged supervisors to
support Proposition 215, the medical marijuana initiative on the November
ballot. A local initiative urging support for the use of the drug for medicinal
purposes was approved by 77 percent of Santa Cruz County voters a few years
ago.
<hr width="100%" ></p>

<p> One speaker Tuesday, a 74-year-old woman who said she uses marijuana
to calm her irritable bowel syndrome, told supervisors she was arrested
about two weeks ago and charged with a felony for growing two marijuana
plants for her use.</p>

<p> ''This is insane,'' she told the board.</p>

<p> Medical marijuana activist Valerie Corral told the board that last
month five residents who use the drug as medicine were arrested by sheriff's
officers. She called the arrests inexcusable, particularly in the face
of past comments by Sheriff Mark Tracy that such cases would have a low
priority in his department.</p>

<p> Activist Scott Imler said members of the local Cannabis Buyers Club
are assuming they will be arrested soon. ''Please inform the sheriff,''
Imler said, ''that we are peaceful people. They need not come with guns;
they need not come with clubs.''</p>

<p> Sheriff's Sgt. Ross said that while his department had received no
formal complaints about Hager's treatment, an investigation was under way.
He said another law enforcement agency, which he declined to identify,
was conducting the probe.</p>

<p> Ross said the July 30 raid was conducted by the Santa Cruz County Narcotics
Enforcement Team, which was at Hager's apartment complex to arrest another
man. When agents mistakenly knocked on Hager's door, Ross said, they smelled
marijuana and saw some of the indoor-growing apparatus in the apartment.</p>

<p> Sheriff's agents were then called, Ross said, and they conducted the
search and the seizure of the 163 plants and the growing system.</p>

<p> He said Hager was neither arrested nor cited.

<h3><img align = center src = "blueorb.gif"><a name = "transactions"><font color = "#2f4f2f" size = 5>Transactions</font></h3>

<font size = 4>

<p>Transactions usually entail one or both of the role of adviser and representative.  Often, the Firm is
called upon to give advice to structure, facilitate or evaluate a proposed transaction or one underway
or about to be consummated.  Similarly, the Firm can be called upon to represent the client, such as by
being its negotiator or emissary, in bringing a transaction about.</p>

<p>Transactions demand an understanding of the business objectives sought to be attained, a realistic
assessment of the legal issues and concomitant risks including the risks of future disputes, and a
focused effort to attain those objectives while keeping the legal risks at an acceptable level.  That is
how the Firm approaches transactions.  Interposing objections that have no realistic application to the
facts, as well as "papering over" issues to make a deal happen when it should not or when the
businessmen have not actually judged the risks worth taking, are things the Firm avoids.</p>

<h3><img align = center src = "blueorb.gif"><a name = "disputes"><font color = "#2f4f2f" size = 5>Disputes</font></h3></a>

<font size = 4>

<p> Disputes -- with business associates, competitors and governmental representatives -- are part of
ongoing commercial relationships.  Responding to disputes starts with assessing, from a strategic
perspective, the nature of the dispute and how to approach it. </p>

<p> Some disputes represent honest disagreements over matters to which the parties gave little heed
when embarking upon the transaction, or which arose as a result of significant economic or regulatory
change.  Dealing with such disputes includes assessing the facts about which the parties disagree and
trying to develop alternative, convergent objectives which the client and the other party to the dispute
will share. </p>

<p> Other disputes comprise something quite different.  The cause of the dispute may be only
indirectly related to the issue seemingly in dispute -- a business war being fought on a battlefield of
opportunity.  The battlefield of opportunity must, of course, be dealt with, but it alone may not end the
disagreement.  Judgment in analyzing and addressing these kinds of disputes is the key to handling
them.  These kinds of disputes can by their nature invoke the Firm's role as an aggressive champion of
the client. </p>

<h3><img align = center src = "blueorb.gif"><a name = "prevention"><font color = "#2f4f2f" size = 5>Prevention</font></h3></a>

<font size = 4>

<p> Preventive law, that is, anticipating areas of concern and minimizing in advance the risks they present,
quintessentially calls into play the Firm's role as adviser. </p>

<p> Preventive advice can be independent of any transaction or an adjunct to a transaction or representation in a dispute. In dealing with a dispute, the Firm also focuses on the prevention of future claims and disputes of similar type. </p>

<h2><font color = "#2f4f2f">BUSINESS DISPUTES</font></h2>

<font size = 4>

<p> A large part of the Firm's practice traditionally has been devoted to the representation of
business clients involved in complex business disputes.  While we have represented clients in a wide
range of business disputes, we have had extensive experience in the following areas: </p>

<ul>

<li><p> Contract Disputes </p>

<li><p> Unfair Competition </p>

<li><p> Commercial Fraud </p>

<li><p> Intellectual Property </p>

<li><p> Reinsurance </p>

<center><img src = "steelbar.gif" alt = "* * * * *"></center>

<h2><font color = "#2f4f2f">INSURANCE COVERAGE</font></h2>

<font size = 4>

<p> The Firm represents a number of insurance companies, both domestic and foreign, in disputes
and litigation with policy holders and other insurance companies. In this regard the Firm not only
represents its clients in litigation but also provides pre-litigation advice and, where in the client's
interest, negotiates the resolution of coverage disputes before they result in litigation.  The majority of
the Firm's insurance coverage practice is in the following areas: </p>

<ul>

<li><p> Long tail claims, including environmental, asbestos, lead paint, breast implant and others </p>

<li><p> Professional Liability </p>

<ul>

<li><p> Directors' & Officers' Liability </p>

<li><p> Accountants' & Lawyers' Malpractice </p>

<li><p> Medical Malpractice </p>

<li><p> Architects' and Engineers' Errors & Omissions </p>

</ul>

<li><p> General Liability </p>

<li><p> Products Liability </p>

<li><p> Advertising Injury </p>

<li><p> Personal Injury </p>

</ul>

</font>

<center><img src = "steelbar.gif" alt = "* * * * *"></center>

<h2><font color = "#2f4f2f">PRODUCTS LIABILITY</font></h2>

<font size = 4>

<p> Over the course of the last two decades, the Firm has been at the forefront of products liability
litigation, successfully defending products manufacturers by fashioning novel and creative defenses to
combat the ever-changing theories of the plaintiffs' bar.  Among the clients we have successfully
defended are: </p>

<dt>

<dd><p>  an automobile manufacturer in numerous alleged defective product recall cases </p>

<dd><p>  a copier manufacturer, a medical device manufacturer and a computer manufacturer
against suits by distributors in cases filed nationwide alleging economic loss as a result of the
manufacturers' allegedly defective products </p>

<dd><p>  an industrial equipment manufacturer in claims by employees of its customers who
contended that they lost limbs as a result of the poor design of the equipment </p>

<dd><p>a pharmaceutical company against failure to warn and improper labeling claims </p>

<dd><p>  an electric tool manufacturer and electronic components manufacturers against claims that
design deficiencies caused loss of life and injury </p>

</dt>

</font>

<center><img src = "steelbar.gif" alt = "* * * * *"></center>

<h2><font color = "#2f4f2f">LITIGATION AND ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION</font> </h2>

<font size = 4>

<p> The Firm represents clients in litigation and  alternative dispute resolution  across the entire
spectrum of commercial and individual activity.  This includes representing international and domestic
clients at trials and appeals in court proceedings at all levels, mediations and arbitrations throughout
the United States.  Attorneys of the Firm also serve as arbitrators at our clients' behest. </p>

</font>

<center><img src = "steelbar.gif" alt = "* * * * *"></center>

<h2><font color = "#2f4f2f">CONSTRUCTION LAW</font></h2>

<font size = 4>

<p> The Firm has represented architects, builders, contractors, developers, engineers and owners in
the negotiation and preparation of construction contracts.  It also has been involved in the litigation of
large construction claims involving such issues as performance, force majeure, business interruption
and escalation provisions.  Construction industry clients represented by the Firm include Fortune 500
companies, national contractors, major manufactures of construction specialty products and
municipalities and other governmental units. </p>

align=left>It has often been said that we can surf the country
and the world in a matter of seconds on the
Internet.  In a certain sense, this is no doubt true.  Indeed,
the Internet is changing not only the
way we spend our leisure time -- but also the way we do business
as well.  Of course, traditional
business limitations still exist in some form; but these are more
and more easily overcome as the
sophistication of computer hardware and software allows for the
exchange of more and more of
what we do and what we buy through the Internet.</p>

<p>The technology unfortunately -- or perhaps fortunately -- may
have left traditional notions of
equity and justice behind.  Hand in hand with these technological
changes will come changes in
the laws which govern us and the way that courts apply them.</p>

<p> One of the most basic questions of any court system is and
always has been which court has the right to decide a dispute
between two people.  With the advances in technology and the
use of cyberspace the question now sometimes comes down to "When
two people who use the Internet have a dispute relating to their
use of the Internet, and the only connection between them has
been the Internet, what court decides the dispute?"  The two of
them can be hundreds or thousands of miles or even continents
apart and the court nearest one of them may be very far away from
and inconvenient for the other. 

<p>If you do business over the Internet, do you think that
someone who disputes your rights can
sue you where his or her (not your) Internet connection is
located?  If you run a one-person store
in Hawaii or Australia, do you expect to be sued in Ohio by
someone in Ohio who encountered
you over the Internet?  Probably you have never thought about
this, and probably your initial
answer will be no, but if so you may be in for a surprise.</p>

<img src = "bluemarb.gif" height = 5 width = 650>

<p>At the end of July, 1996, the United States Court of Appeals
for the Sixth Circuit determined
that CompuServe could sue in Ohio an individual from Texas who
conducted what seems to have
been a small, part-time business only through the Internet and
interacted with CompuServe via
modem.  CompuServe has it corporate headquarters in Ohio.  In
<i>CompuServe v.
Patterson</I>, 89 F.3d 1257 (6th Cir. 1996), the Court dealt with
the question of whether or not
CompuServe could sue one of its subscribers in Ohio -- even
though the subscriber was an
individual (not a large business) from Texas and had never
physically been to Ohio -- but had
visited (so to speak) CompuServe in Ohio by using the Internet. 
The Court had to answer the question, did Ohio's courts have
jurisdiction over the out-of-state subscriber?</p>

<p>How do courts in the U.S. obtain "jurisdiction" over parties
who have a dispute, that is, which court has the
right to decide a particular dispute between those particular
parties?  Most disputes occur
between people located near one another in the same state or who
at least interacted with one
another face-to-face generally in a particular locale, so that it
seems fair to say the court in that
locale should decide their dispute.  But localized interaction
between people is not the norm of
the Internet.  In the U.S., the Due Process Clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment to the United
States Constitution usually determines when and where an
individual may be  subject to a civil
lawsuit in another state.  The basic rule, announced by the U.S.
Supreme Court in 1945 in
<i>International Shoe Co. v. Washington</I>, 326 U.S. 310,
requires examination of the facts of
the case, to determine if the nonresident defendant has
sufficient contacts with the state in which
the suit was filed such that the exercise of jurisdiction by a
court in that state would comport with
"traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice." 
Courts have gone to great lengths to
determine whether a person's activities in a state were enough so
that it would not offend these
<b><i>traditional notions</b></I> to allow an aggrieved party to
haul that person into the courts
of a state where he is not a resident.  The determination was
made based upon (i) whether the
person purposefully availed himself of the privilege of acting in
the foreign state, (ii) whether the
subject of the suit arose from the person's actions in that
foreign state, and (iii) whether the
person's acts (or the consequences thereof) in the state are
sufficient to make it "reasonable" to
bring that person into the foreign court.</p>

<p>But, how then do "traditional notions" apply to something like
the Internet?  Let us return to the decision in <i>CompuServe v.
Patterson</i>.  CompuServe brought suit in its home state of Ohio
against an individual
who lived and worked in Texas and developed shareware apparently
as a side business.  The
Texas software developer sold and marketed his shareware over the
Internet via CompuServe's
shareware service.  He used the CompuServe service by modem from
his home computer in
Texas and he subscribed to CompuServe via that modem connection.  
The Texas shareware
developer also sent several messages to CompuServe through
e-mail, claiming that CompuServe
software products infringed upon his rights.  The e-mail messages
originated from the shareware
developer's desk in Texas and ended up at CompuServe's Ohio
headquarters.  Because the Texas
developer used the CompuServe shareware service, Internet surfers
who downloaded his
software got it off a CompuServe server in Ohio.</p>

<p>CompuServe, in what might be viewed as a preemptive strike,
sued in Ohio for a declaration
by the Ohio court that CompuServe did not violate the Texas
developer's rights.  Obviously, for
the Texas shareware developer to assert those rights (or whatever
rights he may have), he must
either prove his case in Ohio or convince the Ohio court that it
lacks jurisdiction to decide the
issue.  Now that the Court has determined that suit in Ohio is
proper, the Texas shareware developer must now find an Ohio
lawyer and
probably also travel to Ohio in order to protect the rights he
claims to his software.</p>

<p>Incidentally, the Texas shareware developer told the Ohio
trial court that he had never been to Ohio and
that the only connection he had at all to Ohio was the fact that
CompuServe happened to be there. 
Yet, the Court of Appeals found that his electronic visits to
Ohio subjected him to the
jurisdiction of the Ohio courts.  In announcing its decision, the
Court of Appeals stressed that the
Texas shareware developer "consciously reached out from Texas to
Ohio to subscribe to
CompuServe, and to use its service to market his computer
software on the Internet."  Further, it
found that he "originated and maintained contacts with Ohio" when
he e-mailed CompuServe at
its Ohio headquarters concerning his claims.  Finally, the Court
admitted that "it may be
burdensome for [the Texas shareware developer] to defend a suit
in Ohio, but he knew when he
entered into [the agreement] with CompuServe that he was making a
connection with Ohio . . .
."</p> 

<img src = "bluemarb.gif" height = 5 width = 650>

<p>Obviously, the practical effects of the <i>CompuServe</I>
decision still must play
themselves out.  Courts no doubt will continue to grapple with
similar jurisdictional questions as
our cyber-"visits" from state to state and country to country
continue to grow exponentially.</p>

<p><img src = "fire.gif" height=105 width=85 align=left>The
<i>CompuServe</I> decision tells those who use the Internet for
business (or for
anything that could give rise to a legal claim) that they had
better very carefully consider the
transactions entered into over the Internet, because while the
other side of the world may be only
a mouse-click away, defending an action in a foreign court is an
entirely different matter.</p></font>

We start with the federal Communications Decency Act of 1996, a
controversial piece of legislation signed into law by President Clinton
on February 8, 1996, and now under legal challenge by the American
Civil Liberties Union and others.  The Communications Decency Act bans
the communication of "obscene or indecent" material via the Internet to
anyone under 18 years of age.   (Telecommunications Act of 1996,
Section 502, 47 U.S.C. Section 223[a].)<P>

We all know that this new law resulted from a complex meshing of
political forces in an election year during which family values will
continue widely to be extolled.  But, is this part of the new federal
law legal?  All of us have heard of the First Amendment to the United
States Constitution.  It states in pertinent part that "Congress shall
make no law. . .  abridging the freedom of speech . . . ."  If those
words are to be read literally, then the knee-jerk answer would be that
this new law is illegal.  But, the First Amendment, while historically
read fairly broadly, has never been interpreted literally.  Even Thomas
Jefferson, when he served as President, tried to prosecute conduct that
he viewed as seditious speech.  The U.S.  Supreme Court also
consistently has ruled that pornography and obscenity fall outside the
First Amendment, along with a variety of other seeming "speech."<P>

At the same time, adult conduct which includes sexually oriented
conduct that some (perhaps even arguably a majority) might consider
immoral has been considered protected by the First Amendment when it
takes place in a private setting.  Perhaps the outmost reach of that
theory of constitutional "privacy" manifested itself in "Roe v. Wade"
and the right to an abortion (itself now a controversial proposition).
Surely, though, it can be said, Internet surfers who find "indecent"
material (whatever that is) as a result of their inquiries from home
(or the office) fall well within the outer reach that Roe demarcated?
Or is that true?<P>

Then, we come to the question of "children," the stated objective of
the new Congressional ban.  Anyone who watches the news or reads
newspapers knows that the courts frequently hold that government can
legitimately try to protect the well-being of children.  At the same
time,  how parents rear their children has generally been left to the
parents, although perhaps because of publicized parental lapses more
governmental activism seems to exist in that arena too. But it seems
fair to say that few parents, irrespective of their political or
religious views, would agree that the federal government should
intercede in how they raise their own children.  In general, parents
have access to a wider variety of Internet access controls than
controls over cable television or the movies.  Additionally, most
children who live in environments in which their parent slack access to
Internet protection likely also lack the resources to acquire computer
technology and Internet access.  Is Congress intruding into the
parental sphere in banning "indecent" Internet communications?<P>

Proceeding further, the courts have generally given the federal
government wide latitude to control what can be said or shown over the
commercial television "airways."  We have all probably heard of the
FCC's ban of "indecent" speech and the "seven dirty words" of George
Carlin or the antics of Howard Stern.  But, the commercial television
airwaves flow almost inexorably into everyone's home, with little more
effort than the flick of a dial.  The Internet is something that most
of us must buy access to and which we then choose to surf on our own.
And does the government really have the right to tell parents what
books and magazines they can let their children read at home or what
television programs or motion pictures they should let their children
watch? <P>

If the answer is, "yes," then how much stretching does it take to
extend government control so as to encompass notions of social or
philosophical or religious tutelage?<P>

A complex legal and societal problem indeed! To recap, if the Internet
is akin to commercial network television and  if  the  government can
constitutionally restrict the menu of offerings there, then why not the
Internet?  But, the Internet is different, in lots of ways.  And, what
does "indecent" mean anyway?  "Pornography" and "obscenity" are
difficult enough concepts in their own right. Justice Potter Stewart of
the United States Supreme Court wrote in 1964: "perhaps I could never
succeed in intelligibly" explaining what it is. "But I know it when I
see it".<P>

"Indecent," whatever that means (Congress itself did not define the
term) must surely be something less offensive than "obscenity."  Isit
just, fair or even wise to penalize someone from making available
information which some would label "indecent" but which few of us can
even define?<P>

These are among the issues that the courts must decide in ruling on the
legality of the Communications Decency Act of 1996.  Only time will
tell the outcome.  At least, though, the courts are not quite as
immediately influenced by current political trends as legislators and
their final decisions may be less emotionally passionate and more
deliberative.<P>

<p><font size = 4>  In today's world of ever increasing
technology, much of what had been the written word is now the
Cyberspace word.  Much of what had been printed and transmitted
by mail, or overnight delivery or facsimile, is now sent by
e-mail or on-line group session.  In short, messages that would
have required a few days or a few hours to prepare and deliver
five years ago, can now be transmitted electronically within
seconds.  All well and good, but what does this have to do with
the law, you might ask? </p>

<p>  Perhaps the most important step in determining someone's
rights or defenses in an actual or potential lawsuit is
determining what the evidence will show if a case is brought to
trial.  One of the most compelling forms of evidence is the
written word.  Judges and juries can hold documents and read them
for themselves.  When they look at contemporaneously prepared
documents, they often conclude they do not necessarily need to
decide whether the testimony (like from a live witness in Court)
is truthful.  Many times the fact that something appears in a
document, usually generated years prior to the trial, is enough. 
Interesting observation, you say, but what does this have to do
with technology or e-mail? </p>

<p>  When writers needed to put pen to paper (literally) or at
least had to type text (or have someone type it for them) and
then sign the document so that it could be physically delivered,
they usually took a fair amount of care to make certain that they
meant what they wrote and were willing to abide by what they
wrote.  The very process of creating the document tended to make
the writer think about it, sometimes edit it, and in general
appreciate that the document might come back to "haunt" him if he
did not really mean what he wrote. </p>

<p> Now, the fact is that many companies use electronic mail as a
means of allowing employees to communicate with each other, both
in the same office and around the country.  In addition, many of
us have personal computers, laptops and notebooks that we use to
communicate with the office while at home.  Add to that the
number of people who use e-mail on a more personal level over the
Internet, and the number of people who participate in on-line
talk sessions (whether at work or through postings to Usenet or other newsgroups or in "chat
rooms), and it soon becomes apparent that the Cyber "document"
touches nearly everyone.  Indeed, it is an extremely efficient
means of communication. </p>

<p>  The problem with e-mail and on-line sessions is that many
people believe or assume that those methods of communication
afford anonymity or at least represent an ephemeral exchange
similar to the spoken word.  (Anyone who has ever participated in
an "I said versus you said" argument realizes that the merely
spoken word addressed to but one witness can be very difficult to
reconstruct much less pin down.) </p>

<p>  This view about Cyberdocuments, that they are much like
quarks -- fleeting at best -- comes partly from the "chat-group"
and "screen name" culture born from the Internet and the newsgroups of the Usenet.  In
most cases this view is not well founded.  In addition, many
people believe or assume that an e-mail message exists only until
it is read and then erased by the recipient; then, they think,
it's gone.  For some reason, as a result of these factors, people
transmit messages via e-mail, post messages to newsgroups or make remarks on-line that they
would never commit to writing (recall some of the e-mail messages
you have seen or heard about).  This is a huge mistake. </p>

<p>  Most e-mail systems do not afford anonymity.  The same is
true of on-line sessions.  And most office network systems that
link office computers use some form of data backup, be it tape or
optical disk.  The backup programs are designed to periodically
back up all data on a system, until all of the backed-up data is
transformed onto long term storage media.  As a practical matter
this means that a large percentage of e-mail messages, whether or
not erased by the recipient after being read, are backed up and
then stored with all of the other computer data on disks and
tapes.  Even in the Usenet world, efforts are underway to devise
means for archival study of years of prior sessions (one such approach
being the <cite>Deja News</cite> search engine). </p>

<p>  Additionally, it is usually very easy to capture a screen or
print an e-mail.  Someone who participated in the communication
process can generally do that legally.  Indeed, while there are
some variations in different states, most of the "privacy"
protection that the law affords deals only with "eavesdropping"
type activity.  And in a lawsuit, when the information becomes
relevant, the courts will often demand production of the material
even if an eavesdropper gathered it or the party who sent it
thought the information was "private" or "off the record."  (Of
course, truly privileged material, such as privileged
communications with a lawyer or a clergyman, usually have a
different legal analysis that applies to them)</p>

<p>  Good lawyers know this all too well.  As a result, requests
for copies of all stored or printed e-mail messages are
frequently made in divorce cases, business disputes,
sex-harassment cases, product liability cases, and almost any
other type of case where what a person says is at issue.  The
American legal system has as one of its most fundamental tenets
the search for truth.  Judges therefore with increasing frequency
order that these back-up and printed copy records be produced in
such litigations.  Even the President of the United States
confronts this problem.  The Reagan White House had, by Court
order, to preserve e-mail backup files as part of the <cite>Iran-Contra</cite> investigation. 
President Clinton had to produce
computer back up in connection with the <cite>Whitewater</cite>
investigation. </p>
 
<p>  A good rule of thumb, and one that we advise our clients, is
this: If you would not put your message in a written letter on
your personal (or company) stationery, then you should not
transmit it via e-mail, or in most instances in any other form,
especially in the workplace.  It really comes down to the
application of common sense . . . and the realization that, just
because you didn't send it in a hard copy writing, <blink><font
color = "#ff0000">that doesn't mean that it doesn't
exist!</blink></font></p>

<p>Near the beginning of this century, the fastest way to find out how your favorite sports team fared in
the big game--besides attending in person--was to catch the news report on the radio or in the next
morning's newspaper.  Now, as the twenty-first century approaches, such constraints simply no longer
exist.  Recent technology has provided avid sports fans with results, statistics, and other information
from almost any major sporting event--almost instantly!</p>

<p>For example, nowadays, such television stations as CNN's Headline News provide continuous score
updates on a scrolling "screen crawler."  Packages on such television systems as DirectTV allow fans
to enjoy virtually any major sporting event through satellite technology.  Additionally, numerous
Internet websites provide instantaneous sports score and injury information with a quick click of a
mouse-button.</p>

<center><img src = "animbar.gif" height = 7 width = 600></center>

<p>Responding to the obvious demand from thousands of enthusiastic fans for immediate sports
information, STATS, Inc. and Motorola, Inc. have developed and marketed the latest technological
gizmo--but not without prompting a great deal of legal controversy.  Additionally, they put a jazzed-up
version on an Internet site, offering it as a service available from America Online.</p>

<p>"SportsTrax" is a wireless paging device that provides up-to-the-minute information about various
sporting events in progress.  STATS, Inc. has hired people from all around the country to watch
television broadcasts of particular games and enter the statistics and results on a computer as the game
is played.  This data is then transmitted to a satellite that beams the information to anyone possessing a
SportsTrax pager.  With the touch of a button, the pager's liquid crystal display reveals such
information as a baseball game's score, the inning, who is on base, who is at bat; a basketball game's
score, time remaining and ball possession information--it even shows a graphic rendition of a
basketball court that illustrates the position of the ball during the game.  The pager allows sports fans
to "attend" any game when access to tickets, a television, or a radio is either inconvenient or
unrealistic.  The companion web site provides similar information online.</p>

<center><img src = "animbar.gif" height = 7 width = 600></center>

<p>The legal controversy stems from the fact that the paging system and Internet site were broadcast and
marketed without the authorization of the sports leagues, television stations, or radio stations that are
in the business of conveying the broadcasts to the public.  As a result, the National Basketball
Association brought suit against STATS, Inc. and Motorola, Inc. in a New York federal court this past
year. <i><b>National Basketball Ass'n v. Sports Team Analysis & Tracking Systems, Inc.</i></b>, 939
F. Supp. 1071 (S.D.N.Y. 1996).  Because STATS, Inc. does not pay to "publish" the sports
information to its customers, the NBA claimed that STATS, Inc. was liable for copyright infringement
and commercial misappropriation.  The NBA sought to recover damages it incurred as a result of the
device as well as to force STATS, Inc. to cease all SportsTrax operations.</p>

<center><img src = "animbar.gif" height = 7 width = 600></center>

<p>The NBA's unfair competition claim was premised on "common law" (that is, the law that emerges
from decisions made by judges in cases over the years, in this instance New York case law).  The
NBA asserted that it possesses the exclusive right to use and license "NBA Intellectual Property" in
conjunction with advertising, promotion, and other products and services in all forms of commerce and
media.  New York law, which is similar to laws in states around the U.S., forbids "taking the skill,
expenditures, and labors of a competitor and misappropriat[ing] for the commercial advantage of one
person . . . a benefit or property right belonging to another."  Sometimes even
factual information--if commercially valuable--is protectable under this law.</p>

<p>The ability to control the dissemination of sports information is undoubtedly valuable to the sports
leagues.  Consequently, the sports leagues employ various methods of limiting others' use of their
events or broadcasts without permission.  Nowadays, when a patron buys a ticket to an event, such as
a basketball game, it is common for the back of the ticket to exhibit a warning.  For example--"you
agree that you will not transmit or aid in transmitting any description, account, picture, or
reproduction of the event to which this ticket admits you."  In an attempt to protect the value of its
$750 million, four-year contract with NBC, televised NBA games are now broadcast along with a
warning that "this program is authorized under the rights granted by the National Basketball
Association," and that unauthorized use of "the pictures, descriptions or accounts" of the game is
prohibited.  According to papers filed in the lawsuit, the SportsTrax manufacturers originally sought a
license from the NBA to sell such information to the public via wireless communications, but the
negotiations eventually broke down and STATS, Inc. marketed the pager anyway.</p>

<center><img src = "animbar.gif" height = 7 width = 600></center>

<p>In its copyright claim, the NBA asserted that it owns the copyrights in all broadcasts and transmissions
in all media of NBA games, and that STATS, Inc. should be prohibited from using game information
for commercial profit.  Congress enacted our current copyright law, which gives authors exclusive
rights to their "original works" for a finite period.  The law endeavors to protect creative expression. 
Prohibiting others' use of <i>factual</i> information--which is in the public domain--is generally
disallowed as too broad under copyright law.</p>

<center><img src = "animbar.gif" height = 7 width = 600></center>

<p>Because copyright law does not allow an author to
prohibit the reproduction of facts included in a copyrighted work, the NBA could not recover under a
copyright rationale.</p>

<p>Based on the "common law" of misappropriation, though, Judge Loretta Preska of the United
States District Court in Manhattan granted an injunction against Motorola and STATS, Inc., ruling
that their nearly real-time dissemination of sports information constituted a misappropriation of the
NBA's and its licensees' commercial interests in their intellectual property.</p>

<center><img src = "animbar.gif" height = 7 width = 600></center>

<p>Appeal of this ruling by STATS, Inc. has sparked the interest of many.  In an attempt to overturn the
court's decision, not only America Online, but also such entities as The New York Times, and the
Associated Press have filed "friend of the court" briefs arguing that STATS, Inc. has the right to
produce, market, sell, and operate its SportsTrax pager without consent of the NBA.  Sports
organizations such as the National Football League, National Hockey League, and Major League
Baseball, as well as the media network NBC, align themselves with the NBA on this issue.</p>

<p>The lawsuit raises interesting questions about how the law should respond to this untested
technological invention.  Are the continuous updates provided by the SportsTrax pager and companion web site really a re-creation or broadcast of a sporting event or are they merely the relay of factual news information? 
What is the appropriate level of control given to the sports leagues in preventing unauthorized
broadcasting by third (nonpaying) parties of the factual information generated from their games? 
Surely the NBA cannot stop someone from telephoning a friend and telling him that the Knicks are up
by 6 with 2:40 to play in the fourth quarter!</p>

<p>The courts need to strike a balance between public and private interests.  While we like to think of "sports" as more than mere, paid entertainment, the truth remains that professional athletics are performances of highly paid performers.  Up-to-the-minute accounts of
games certainly increase fan interest and, indeed, one would think that sports leagues would be eager to
see their games on new media.  Instant sports information, however, is extremely valuable.  While rapidly transmitted numerical and shorthand written descriptions lack much of the "color" of verbal and pictorial play-by-play reports, they may be sufficiently close approximations that it can be fairly argued that companies like Motorola and STATS, Inc. should be willing to pay reasonable sums for it, otherwise it may be unfair to let them reap where they have not sown.</p>

<center><img src = "animbar.gif" height = 7 width = 600></center>

<p>In response to its critics, STATS, Inc. maintains that SportsTrax does not attempt to rebroadcast the
event--it is merely a relay of scores and other factual information.  It is unlikely that SportsTrax
competes with a live game or television or even radio broadcast.  No digital display can ever compare
to actually watching the players on the court "setting a pick" or "ripping down" an offensive rebound. 
But how does this apply to a sport like baseball, where a detailed on-line play-by-play description
would be very similar to what a radio broadcast could offer?</p>

<p>At least one thing is clear: we have seen only the beginning of this new technology.  With a touch of a
button (and a monthly fee), perhaps fans around the world will soon be able to watch still pictures and
film-clips, or listen to sound, almost as the action unfolds live.  In fact, during the 1996 U.S. Open tennis tournament, fans could access an Internet website that displayed a still photograph of a match in progress, updated every thirty seconds. Where does one draw the line between
conveying factual information and providing a "portable ticket to the game" that eliminates the
financial involvement of the sporting leagues or the contracted-for media broadcasts?</p>

<p>As computer and information technology changes the way we distribute and receive information in the
twenty-first century, our courts will further attempt to wrestle with the necessity to adjust our laws
accordingly.  With advocates on either side of the SportsTrax issue endeavoring to persuade the court
of appeals, perhaps an upcoming court decision on these important concerns will help to clarify many
of the legal issues regarding the newly-explored world of computer and information technology.</p>

<font size = 4>

<p>Words like "encryption," "de-coder keys," and "scrambled data" probably bring to mind visions of national security, intelligence agents and international spies.  But, recently, the concept of coded communications has become a hot topic for Internet users, politicians, privacy activists and law enforcement agents.  The increased popularity of on-line communications, and the use of the Internet for financial transactions, has fueled the debate about technology that can prevent unauthorized access to electronically-transmitted material.</p>

<p>Should such technology be highly restricted by the government, or should it be allowed to flourish in the American or global market?  The answer depends on your
 perspective.</p>

<p>The technology in question is called cryptography -- the use of mathematical formulas to encrypt electronic information so it is indecipherable without the proper digital "key."  At one time, the average person had little interest in this arcane topic, then the domain of spies and large banking institutions.</p>  

<p>However, the need for and implications of encoding software grow with the number of people and businesses that use the Internet.</p>  

<center><img src = "rainbo.gif" height = 5 width = 650></center>

<p><img src = "ganim5b.gif" height=110 width=110 align = center> International communications compound the problem.</p>

<p>Both parties to coded Internet communications need cryptographic software that interfaces one with the other in order for the recipient to decode what the sender wants to say.  Examples include credit card or bank account numbers in commercial transactions or electronically transmitted medical records or digitized medical images.</p>

<p>Self-evidently, interception of such communications, or tampering with them, could cause significant harm.  Some people further assert that they have the right to keep their communications secret from anyone else as a matter of personal privacy.</p>

<center><img src = "rainbo.gif" height = 5 width = 650></center>

<p>Presently, though, the U.S. government has strict laws regarding this technology.  The Secretary of State placed information security systems and equipment, including cryptographic software, on the U.S. Munitions List (<i>see</i> 22 C.F.R. Section 121.1, category XIII), which means it cannot be sent abroad without a State Department arms export license.  The State Department grants licenses only for weak encryption software, that is, software that develops codes that are relatively easy to crack.</p>

<p>Critics complain that this approach is causing the United States to fall behind in the worldwide electronic communications market.  And Internet users, particularly those in the business community, are pushing for relaxed restrictions so that companies can feel more secure about transmitting sensitive business, financial and legal material.</p>

<center><img src = "rainbo.gif" height = 5 width = 650></center>

<p>So why is the government holding back?  Law enforcement officials warn that open access to advanced levels of this technology will give criminals a system through which they can use codes to communicate, secure in the knowledge that police will be unable to decipher their transmissions.  And, intelligence agents fear that international spies will be able to use strong encrypting technology to pass on top-secret information to other countries and that terrorists will use the technology to hide the planning of terrorist activities.</p>

<p>The debate has grown increasingly controversial, especially with the introduction of H.R. 3011, the <i>Security and Freedom Through Encryption Act</i> ("SAFE" Act), which would relax licensing and export restrictions.  Those opposed to this effort have testified at length as to how increased levels of encryption technology would harm law enforcement efforts.   According to Jamie S. Gorelick, Deputy Attorney General, U.S. Department of Justice, the harmful effects of cryptography have already begun to surface.  (<i>See, Hearing on H.R. 3011, The Security & Freedom Through Encryption (SAFE) Act Before the House Judiciary Committee</i>, 104th Congress (Sep't 25-26, 1996), <i>Statement of Jamie S. Gorelick, Deputy Attorney General</i>.)</p>  

<p>For example, Gorelick stated that Ramzi Yousef, who was recently convicted of conspiring to blow up ten U.S. airliners in the Far East, apparently stored information about his terrorist plot in an encrypted computer file in Manila, the Phillippines.   Also, in a major international drug-trafficking case, the subject of a court ordered wiretap used a telephone encryption device to significantly hinder the surveillance.  "Kiddie porn" dealers have even encrypted obscene and pornographic images of children over the Internet.  Gorelick cautioned that stronger encryption products will increase to the point of denying law enforcement access to stored electronic evidence, resulting in an increased threat to public safety.</p>

<p>On the other hand, supporters of SAFE argue that stronger encryption technology would ensure safe electronic commerce, protect individual privacy and boost the competitiveness of U.S. companies.  Further, they point out that elaborate digital codes would actually hinder crime by providing better protection for top-secret information such as banking and telecommunications networks.</p>

<center><img src = "rainbo.gif" height = 5 width = 650></center>

<p>So far, no one has come up with an approach that pleases all sides.</p>

<p>At one time, some politicians supported the "trusted third party" approach whereby master "key" codes to the scrambled data would be placed in the hands of an escrow agent, such as a private party or a governmental entity.  Law enforcement officials would then need to go through proper legal channels in order to obtain the keys for use in a particular situation.  But, the idea of placing the codes with a third party negates the purpose of encryption, that is, keeping the coded information a secret.  If the escrow agent, through neglect or otherwise, were to let the keys out, then things that should have remained secret could become vulnerable and a new set of master keys might need to be created, with a new set of encryption software written to use those keys.</p>

<p>The escrow agent approach also concedes that the government should have the ability to decode anything, with limitations placed by law on the circumstances in which it may properly do so.  Accepting that premise, a recent suggestion has been raised that may provide a compromise for dealing with the possibility that the escrow agent could lose the master keys.</p>

<p>Eleven major information technology vendors and user organizations, including Apple Computer and IBM, have announced the formation of an alliance to develop an exportable worldwide approach to strong encryption.  This approach has been labeled the "key recovery" system and would involve the development and distribution of technology that could permit the recovery of anyone's lost or damaged keys without the need to store or escrow the master key codes with a third party.  Law enforcement agents could then gain access to the data after securing a court order that would allow them to recover the keys.</p>

<p>This approach would seem to satisfy the concerns of everyone involved, except the most ardent advocates of privacy at all costs.  In fact, Vice President Al Gore recently announced the White House's support for  the "key recovery" system, suggesting that the Administration has abandoned the "escrow" approach.   But, not all parties believe that "key recovery" is the way to go.  Some U.S. companies, like Netscape, have said that the proposed system will not work and privacy activists have expressed similar doubts.</p>

<p>As with most controversies, it will no doubt be difficult to come up with a solution that makes everybody happy.  But the problem is one that will not go away.  As use of the Internet increases, more and more people will be affected by the issue of encryption.  The debate is likely to heat up before it cools down, particularly with the proposal that Congress enact the SAFE Act.</p>

				LONDON, UK&#0151;The announcement by Bill Gates Microsoft Corporation that their new Internet Explorer 3.0 supports 128 bit secure encryption underlines advances in World Wide Web security. 100% Secure transactions are now a reality and consumer confidence is at an all time high.  
			</font>
			<br><br>
			<font face="Times New Roman,Times">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					Throughout the development of the Internet, data integrity and security have been important issues. When an Internet client submits secret information, such as his or her credit card details to an online service, they need to be sure that a third party cannot gain access to the information as it travels through various computers on the way from the clients computer to the services server. Customers rightfully feared that hackers might be able to get hold of their credit card details and use them in fraudulent transactions. 
			</font>
			<br><br>
			<font face="Times New Roman,Times">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					Early on in the history of the World Wide Web, Netscape faced up to the challenge of providing secure transactions, introducing SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) Security. The new system, which operates similarly to famous encryption software PGP (Pretty Good Privacy), for the first time meant that Internet users all around the world could be sure that none of their private information would get into the wrong hands. 
			</font>
			<br><br>
			<font face="Times New Roman,Times">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					All of the newest browsers form Microsoft and Netscape support secure transactions, as well as several others manufactured by different software companies. SSL works by sending out its public key to browsers which request secure information. The browser returns its own instantaneously produced key.  
			</font>
			<br><br>	
			<font face="Times New Roman,Times">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					Like PGP, information sent from the server to the browser is encrypted so that only the expected recipient of any particular piece of information can understand it. Information sent from the Internet browser to the required server is also encrypted. Hackers can still listen to information as it is transmitted around the world wide web, but because of sophisticated cryptography, they cannot decipher what is actually contained within such data.
			</font>
			<br><br>	
			<font face="Times New Roman,Times">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					The 128 bit security offered by Microsofts new browser has been available for Netscape 'Navigator' for some time. The move by the software giant illustrates a common desire that encryption should be as exacting as possible. John Ludwig, Vice president of the Internet platform and tools division at Microsoft commented, A critical element to the ultimate success of the Internet is our ability as an industry to provide users a way to feel confident that they are shielded from the security issues involving the Internet.  	
			</font>
			<br><br>	
			<font face="Times New Roman,Times">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					Due to American export regulations concerning munitions, it is illegal to export 128 bit encryption software. Instead, international users have access to a 40 bit version of both Microsoft and Netscapes World Wide Web navigators. Although 128 bit software has an advantage over the less secure international variation, 40 bit encryption is still immensely powerful. 
			</font>
			<br><br>	
			<font face="Times New Roman,Times">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					In a controlled experiment, it took more than a week for 10 super-computers to pull 2 or 3 credit card numbers out of a continuous stream of numbers in a test last year. At the time, a member of the consortium who carried out the tests which were intended to investigate security across the Internet, commented that it would have been far easier and much more profitable to search through a restaurants trash cans and find credit card receipts. 
			</font>
			<br><br>	
			<font face="Times New Roman,Times">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					The scientists who carried out the experiment with 40 bit encryption didnt even waste their time trying to crack the more sophisticated 128 bit system. It seems very unlikely that a would-be hacker with less equipment would bother to gain information out of data encrypted with either type of security!

				VADUZ, LIECHTENSTEIN &#0151; <a href=http://www.interlotto.li/cgi/hserver.exe?mainlot+serve=_mn_main+urlref=3300000852158>InterLotto</a> draw hostess Caroline Burdett has been showing off some of her other talents recently. When she is not announcing the results from the Worlds first online lottery service, Caroline takes to the mountains to practice her skills on the bobsleigh. Shes not done too badly so far. Shes a world champion in the womens two-man competition.
			</font>
			<br><br>
			<font face="Times New Roman,Times">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					Carolines ambitions dont end with a world championship title. Now she has her eye on an Olympic medal. Unfortunately for her, the Olympics dont host a womens two man bobsleigh competition. Undeterred, Caroline, 26, has opted to move to the skeleton, which is likely to become an Olympic sport in the next winter Olympics in 1998.
 			</font>
			<br><br>
			<font face="Times New Roman,Times">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					As reported in Schwizer Illustrierte and Sonntags Blick, two German language publications, Caroline is going solo with her new sleigh. As well as changing allegiances in disciplines, the <a href=http://www.interlotto.li/cgi/hserver.exe?mainlot+serve=_mn_main+urlref=3300000852158>InterLotto</a> hostess is also attempting to move from the Swiss to the Liechtenstein team. 
 			</font>
			<br><br>
			<font face="Times New Roman,Times">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					The small European state has been Carolines home for some time, but she has continued to compete for Switzerlands team as she has Swiss nationality. Having lived  and worked in Liechtenstein and presented the results from Liechtensteins state authorised lottery, Caroline now feels the time is right for her to represent the state in a fuller way.

					It's 5 o'clock (EST) on a snowy day in Liechtenstein. Everything seems perfectly tranquil. But today is Draw day for the lottery with the largest coverage in the world. InterLotto staff in Liechtenstein, start to prepare for the draw. The InterLotto web site is closed for the duration of the draw period, for security reasons and the database behind the only Internet based lottery is physically disconnected, until after the draw.

					At 5.21pm, the scrutineers from Coopers and Lybrand are introduced to the assembled audience. Mrs Inge Silvani and Mr Gerry Meier, like other draw scrutineers, are in Vaduz to make sure that the correct procedure is followed throughout the draw.
			</font>
			<br><br>
			<font face="Times New Roman,Times">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					After a check of the equipment everything is ready. Caroline who will announce the balls is ready to fill the draw machine. She does so at 6pm sharp and the drawing process proceeds without a hitch.

			<br><br>	
			<font face="Times New Roman,Times">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					The assembled audience in Vaduz are the first to notice that after the first ball which is coloured blue, the next four balls are all pink. The last ball is blue. Who can predict a lottery? The numbers of the balls chosen were 12, 21, 20, 24, 18 and 14.

				VADUZ, LIECHTENSTEIN&#0151;Across the world today players of <a href=http://www.interlotto.li/cgi/hserver.exe?mainlot+serve=_mn_main+urlref=3300000852158>InterLotto's</a> Instant Lottery games have been clamouring to get their hands on the newest chance to win bundles of money online, 'Crack the Safe' which was released at 1.30pm (CET). 
			</font>
			<br><br>
			<font face="Times New Roman,Times">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					'Crack the Safe' is the newest addition to <a href=http://www.interlotto.li/cgi/hserver.exe?mainlot+serve=_mn_main+urlref=3300000852158>InterLotto's</a> series of Instant Lottery Games. There are now ten instant lottery games, which complement its initial weekly lottery draw. Players get the chance to win 70,000 Swiss francs instantly as they try their skill at 'Crack the Safe'. And players love it.
			</font>
			<br><br>
			<font face="Times New Roman,Times">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					New games are always popular when they are first introduced, but 'Crack the Safe' has broken all previous records, with players flocking to the Liechtenstein web site, to have an opportunity to win big money with a few mouse clicks. The turnover of the new game has been twice as fast as it was for the last similar game that InterLotto introduced, 'Tic Tac Cash'. 
			</font>
			<br><br>
			<font face="Times New Roman,Times">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					The new game features a series of attractive drawings on the tickets, depicting everything for a safe to a safety deposit box and a piggy bank which could win you thousands of francs in seconds. All you have to do to buy a ticket and stand a chance of making it rich is to click on a couple of buttons. What could be easier?
			</font>
			<br><br>	
			<font face="Times New Roman,Times">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					General Manager of InterLotto, Roland Ospelt, commented humorously, 'It is a very exciting development as it indicates increasing interest in the charitable pastime of safe cracking!' One thing's for sure, there's no problem with being caught if you crack InterLotto's safe!

				VADUZ, LIECHTENSTEIN&#0151;The recently introduced InterLotto competition 'Spot the Ball' is outwitting even its most cunning participants, as the position of a golf ball, football and baseball in three different sports pictures eludes crowds of hopeful players. 
			</font>
			<br><br>
			<font face="Times New Roman,Times">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					'Spot the ball' caused great excitement when it was introduced just over a week and a half ago. Like 'Snowball', the new game has an accumulating jackpot, adding incredible excitement to game play. As the jackpot has grown and grown, it has become clear that the three current game cards are going to prove very difficult to beat. 
			</font>
			<br><br>
			<font face="Times New Roman,Times">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					The money pot is already above 1,500 Swiss francs. And it's growing fast. One click and a lucky winner will walk away with enough money to take a holiday of a life time. You could even afford visit InterLotto's headquarters in Liechtenstein from anywhere in the world!
			</font>
			<br><br>
			<font face="Times New Roman,Times">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					To play 'Spot the ball', you must click on one of three sports pictures at the exact point where you believe the ball has been removed. If you click on the predetermined square which represents the ball, then you will instantly win the full jackpot accumulated from game play on all three sports.
			</font>
			<br><br>	
			<font face="Times New Roman,Times">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					Each game costs 2 Swiss francs and in addition to the jackpot, bonus prizes are available of 4 Swiss Francs if you get near the jackpot. The bonus prizes do not get more common as you get closer to the jackpot, but they show you that you are in the winning portion of the image. 
			</font>
			<br><br>	
			<font face="Times New Roman,Times">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					Now's the time to logon to InterLotto and find the three missing balls while the jackpot is at an all time high. If you've got a dream, you've got a chance.

				LONDON, UK&#0151;Many regular lottery players are rethinking their strategy as recession blues lead into boom realism. Those who played lotto in harder financial times with the hope of landing an unbelievable jackpot at equally unbelievable odds are now seeing sense.
			</font>
			<br><br>
			<font face="Times New Roman,Times">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					During difficult financial times, lottery players look for big bucks at whatever odds. Now that almost all world-wide economies are recovering strongly, players are becoming more discerning. Good odds, reasonable prizes and high value ticket prices are now more important than they have been for over 10 years. 
			</font>
			<br><br>
			<font face="Times New Roman,Times">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					<a href=http://www.interlotto.li/cgi/hserver.exe?mainlot+serve=_mn_main+urlref=3300000852158>InterLotto's (http://www.interlotto.li)</a> weekly lotto game, offers some of the best odds around. It's 6 from 40 ball game gives players a 1 in 3,838,380 of winning the guaranteed SFr 1.2 Million (over US $1 million), among the best odds of any lottery anywhere.
			</font>
			<br><br>
			<font face="Times New Roman,Times">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					Some world lotteries offer top jackpot odds of over 14 million to one. Such lotto games accumulate huge jackpots and rollover week after week raising expectation. But unfortunately for them their heyday appears to have arrived. Huge impossible-to-win jackpots are no longer essential for a good lottery as competitors favour games where they stand a chance of winning.
			</font>
			<br><br>	
			<font face="Times New Roman,Times">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					Ticket price has also become an issue to discerning lotto players everywhere. It cost only SFr 1 (about US 50 cents) to buy a chance to win with InterLotto. The good odds, low ticket prize and high jackpot produce an enticing competition, where you stand a realistic chance of becoming a millionaire with a single click of your mouse. With the added advantage that InterLotto is available on your desktop <a href=http://www.interlotto.li/cgi/hserver.exe?mainlot+serve=_mn_main+urlref=3300000852158>through the internet</a> there's no excuse not to have a go.

				VADUZ, LIECHTENSTEIN&#0151;It was time to spot <a href=http://www.interlotto.li/cgi/hserver.exe?mainlot+serve=_mn_main+urlref=3300000852158>InterLottos</a> lucky lady on Saturday 21 September at 5.48pm (Central European time) as a female America Online subscriber walked off with a cool 1,903 Swiss francs.

					The <a href=http://www.interlotto.li/cgi/hserver.exe?mainlot+serve=_mn_main+urlref=3300000852158>&#0145;Spot the Ball&#0146;</a> game has gained great popularity with lottery players ever since it was released two weeks ago. Over the past weekend, however, it has topped all expectations as players from around the world have flocked to get in on the action. 
			</font>
			<br><br>
			<font face="Times New Roman,Times">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					Before the weekend, the jackpot was well over 1,200 Swiss francs (more than US $1,000). On Saturday night, the jackpot was won during a game of &#0145;Spot the Ball Golf &#0146;. The prize was 1,906 Swiss Francs (US $1,530). That was when lotto fever became contagious, as players worked the jackpot back up to a staggering 1,650 Swiss Francs (over US $1340) at 12.30pm (CET) today. And the totals getting higher all the time.
			</font>
			<br><br>
			<font face="Times New Roman,Times">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					There is a choice of three sports in the InterLotto skill game. When you play &#0145;Spot the Ball &#0146; you have a choice of Football, Baseball or Golf. The first golf puzzle has now been cracked. It will be interesting to see which sport is beaten next. The new golf puzzle looks simple, but you never know where the illusive ball is, until you start looking!
			</font>
			<br><br>	
			<font face="Times New Roman,Times">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					So far, baseball has been the most popular of the sports available, with 42% of the playing action going to the US sporting choice. Next in popularity is soccer, which has had 37% of all plays. Golf is not far behind with 31% of game play.
			</font>
			<br><br>	
			<font face="Times New Roman,Times">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					A wider variety of sports will be added to &#0145;Spot the Ball &#0146; in the future. If you want to see a particular sport represented in &#0145;Spot the Ball &#0146; email the Lotto News Network at <a href=mailto:balls@lottonews.com>balls@lottonews.com</a> and well be sure to pass on any favourites to the people at InterLotto on your behalf .

				LONDON, UK&#0151;The Internet is more popular than ever. The demand for Internet services has meant that many potential customers have up to now not had a chance to experience the facilities that the World Wide Web and other services have to offer.  
			</font>
			<br><br>
			<font face="Times New Roman,Times">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					Various companies have started to introduce Internet terminals, which can be accessed by the general public without the expense of buying their own personal computer. Cyber Cafes have also been providing Internet access by making Internet-ready PCs available to the public. The most interesting of the new products is an Internet terminal, which is so simple that even the most non-computer literate users will find it easy to navigate their way around the World Wide Web, use email and keep up to date with newsgroups. 
			</font>
			<br><br>
			<font face="Times New Roman,Times">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					<a href="//www.interpad.com/">InterPad</a> is one solution to the global Internet shortage. Combining Windows 95 software and Intel Pentium technology with touch screen functionality, the <a href="//www.interpad.com/">InterPad</a> gives instant access to the online world without even so much as a click of the mouse. Instead users can navigate their way with their fingers, by pushing buttons on the screen.
			</font>
			<br><br>
			<font face="Times New Roman,Times">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					<a href="//www.interpad.com/">InterPad</a> makes it easier to access the Internet generally. Its particular advantage is that <a href=http://www.interlotto.li/cgi/hserver.exe?mainlot+serve=_mn_main+urlref=3300000852158>InterLotto (http://www.interlotto.li)</a> the worlds only true Internet Lottery becomes much simpler to play.

			</font>
			<br><br>	
			<font face="Times New Roman,Times">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					One difficulty with an interface which does not include a keyboard or mouse is to enter the user names and passwords necessary for many online service including InterLotto. The problem has been solved with the addition of a card swipe system. Customers can use their credit card or a special <a href="//www.interpad.com/">InterPad</a> card to access to the services they are looking for. 
			</font>
			<br><br>	
			<font face="Times New Roman,Times">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					To enable the greatest number of people to access the new terminals, <a href="//www.interpad.com/">InterPad</a> are planning to install them in public meeting places such as bars and restaurants, where people will have a chance to enjoy all that the Internet has to offer.
			</font>
			<br><br>	
			<font face="Times New Roman,Times">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					To ensure that language is not a barrier to using the new machines, versions of the software are available in several widely spoken languages. With internet terminal technology, the world can seem like a small place, not only for those with computers at work or at home, but for those of all nationalities around the globe.

				VADUZ, LIECHTENSTEIN&#0151;What a year its been for <a href=http://www.interlotto.li/cgi/hserver.exe?mainlot+serve=_mn_main+urlref=3300000852158>InterLotto</a>. Launched on 7 October 1995, the worlds first online lottery service is preparing to celebrate its first birthday on Monday, a year to the day when operations begun. To celebrate a year of successful operations, InterLotto are staging a special promotion Big Birthday Bash with 5,000 Swiss Francs being given away randomly to lotto players.  
			</font>
			<br><br>
			<font face="Times New Roman,Times">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					When InterLotto fired up its massive Internet servers on a snowy Liechtenstein day last year, they offered players a chance to win over US $1,000,000 over the Internet in a weekly lottery which boasted one of the best chances of success of any lotto game in the world. They still do, but now there are also a wide range of other games available, making InterLotto the right bet for those who want to win big money fast.
			</font>
			<br><br>
			<font face="Times New Roman,Times">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					Big Birthday Bash starts on Saturday morning. <a href=http://www.interlotto.li/cgi/hserver.exe?mainlot+serve=_mn_main+urlref=3300000852158>Login to InterLotto</a> and play a few of the games and you stand a chance of winning a random prize. Prizes are awarded when contestants play a game, a notice of each prize being awarded will be posted on the front page of the site. 
			</font>
			<br><br>
			<font face="Times New Roman,Times">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					An InterLotto press release which was distributed electronically late last night, described the promotion, Yes, it's true. On Monday, <a href=http://www.interlotto.li/cgi/hserver.exe?mainlot+serve=_mn_main+urlref=3300000852158>Interlotto</a> will be one year old!! To celebrate we are giving you the presents! 
			</font>
			<br><br>	
			<font face="Times New Roman,Times">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					Prizes in Big Birthday Bash will range between 10 and 100 Swiss Francs. And <a href=http://www.interlotto.li/cgi/hserver.exe?mainlot+serve=_mn_main+urlref=3300000852158>InterLotto</a> will give out cash until the entire 5,000 Swiss Francs has been distributed. A similar promotion, entitled Score of Winners was held during the year with a jackpot pool of SFr 2,700. This time the jackpots almost twice the size, so there are many more chances to win and cash in on <a href=http://www.interlotto.li/cgi/hserver.exe?mainlot+serve=_mn_main+urlref=3300000852158>InterLottos</a> popularity.

				LAS VEGAS, USA&#0151;The World Gaming Congress and Expo '96 hosted by the International Gaming and Wagering Business (IGWB) took place in Las Vegas between 1 and 3 October. The central theme of the conference was Casinos and other varieties of profit-making gaming, but charitable gaming operations and lotteries were also discussed in detail, in the many workshops and seminars that took place during the three day seminar.
			</font>
			<br><br>
			<font face="Times New Roman,Times">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					The keynote speech for the conference was presented by futurist Frank Feather, author of G Forces: The 35 Global Forces Restructuring our Future. The world-renowned business strategist presented a thought-provoking forecast of trends most likely to impact the gaming industry in the year 2000 and beyond., considering a range of topics from socio-cultural issues to economics, environmentalism and advanced technology. 
			</font>
			<br><br>
			<font face="Times New Roman,Times">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					Feather spoke of his vision of the future where companies are forced to reorganise global strategies in order to achieve success in the local marketplace. Included in the strategist's outlook for the future of gaming is greater involvement in the Internet, as a new medium for current gaming companies. His thoughts were echoed in many of the conferences other speeches and workshops. 
			</font>
			<br><br>
			<font face="Times New Roman,Times">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					Throughout the 3 day event, there was much talk about the possibilities that the Internet afforded over the next few years as well as discussions about current online gaming such as <a href=http://www.interlotto.li/cgi/hserver.exe?mainlot+serve=_mn_main+urlref=3300000852158>InterLotto</a> who have set up an online lottery service. The consensus of discussions inside and outside of the conference were that companies wishing to offer gaming over the Internet had to display impeccable standards of service and prove to potential customers that they had the right credentials. Above all, legality was a major issue. 
			</font>
			<br><br>	
			<font face="Times New Roman,Times">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					If customers were not sure that they were playing on a legal system, it was believed that they would not be willing to spend their money. Several of the Internet gaming systems currently available have not been legally authenticated, unlike <a href=http://www.interlotto.li/cgi/hserver.exe?mainlot+serve=_mn_main+urlref=3300000852158>InterLotto</a> which exists with the full cooperation of the government of the principality of Liechtenstein.
			</font>
			<br><br>	
			<font face="Times New Roman,Times">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					The sponsors of the event, IGWB, produce a magazine read by many in the gaming community. The cover story on Octobers issue joined Frank Feather in his interest in online gaming. The story Lotto shows life on the Internet discussed <a href=http://www.interlotto.li/cgi/hserver.exe?mainlot+serve=_mn_main+urlref=3300000852158>InterLotto</a>s performance since it was established in October 1995. The article in the respected publication by Patricia McQueen included an interview with James Tucker, <a href=http://www.interlotto.li/cgi/hserver.exe?mainlot+serve=_mn_main+urlref=3300000852158>InterLotto</a>s spokesman.
			</font>
			<br><br>	
			<font face="Times New Roman,Times">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					The article soberly discussed <a href=http://www.interlotto.li/cgi/hserver.exe?mainlot+serve=_mn_main+urlref=3300000852158>InterLotto</a>s success rate and the possibilities for an online charitable lottery, as well as issues of legality and the types of games that are currently available on the pioneering lottery system. McQueen noted, Instant tickets became <a href=http://www.interlotto.li/cgi/hserver.exe?mainlot+serve=_mn_main+urlref=3300000852158>InterLotto</a>s second offering in January, and they have rapidly become the most popular game.
			</font>
			<br><br>	
			<font face="Times New Roman,Times">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					Recognition from the world wide gaming community is essential to the success of Inteenet gaming. Early signs indicate that more commercial groups are more than willing to embrace new technologies if they seem to be pertinent to future development and expansion within the industry as a whole. Watch this space for developments as they happen.

				VADUZ, LIECHTENSTEIN&#0151;Pioneering International Lottery developer, <a href="http://www.interlotto.li/cgi/hserver.exe?mainlot+serve=_mn_main+urlref=3300000852158">InterLotto</a>, have once again pushed back technological frontiers as they introduce two new games, which are destined to delight Internet users for many years to come, as more and more lottery players embrace global games played across the World Wide Web.
  
			</font>
			<br><br>
			<font face="Times New Roman,Times">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					Lotto Shoot Out and Little Big One were introduced to game players around the world on Thursday 24 October and both games have proved to be favorites with <a href="http://www.interlotto.li/cgi/hserver.exe?mainlot+serve=_mn_main+urlref=3300000852158">InterLotto</a> players new and old. The new games fill a space between <a href="http://www.interlotto.li/cgi/hserver.exe?mainlot+serve=_mn_main+urlref=3300000852158">InterLottos</a> weekly lottery and their range of instant games. Little Big One is drawn every day. Lotto Shoot Outs draws take place every six hours.
 
			</font>
			<br><br>
			<font face="Times New Roman,Times">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					For years, Lotto players have been clamoring for an alternative to the traditional weekly lotteries that take place all over the world. <a href="http://www.interlotto.li/cgi/hserver.exe?mainlot+serve=_mn_main+urlref=3300000852158">InterLotto</a> has filled the gap. Two great new games with frequent draws give lotto players an enjoyable alternative to traditional weekly big win competitions. Playing the new games is more fun, as the waiting time to find out whether you have been lucky is much shorter. 
			</font>
			<br><br>
			<font face="Times New Roman,Times">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					Little Big One is run in the same way as <a href="http://www.interlotto.li/cgi/hserver.exe?mainlot+serve=_mn_main+urlref=3300000852158">InterLottos</a> 6/40 weekly lottery, but there is a draw every day and the odds are significantly better as competitors need only match 5 balls out of 15. Like the weekly lottery, you can buy tickets in advance for future games and use a random generator to decide the numbers you enter to save on time. The lucky player who matches all 5 winning balls wins the entire accumulating jackpot.
			</font>
			<br><br>	
			<font face="Times New Roman,Times">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					<a href="http://www.interlotto.li/cgi/hserver.exe?mainlot+serve=_mn_main+urlref=3300000852158">InterLottos</a> other new game, Lotto Shoot Out works on a similar basis to common bingo games, but its certainly Bingo with an exciting difference. Bingo has seen a resurgence in popularity over the last few years, and is currently one of the most played games around the globe. Many casinos have even begun to offer bingo games in response to customer pressure. 

			</font>
			<br><br>	
			<font face="Times New Roman,Times">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					Users select six numbers, as they would if they were playing lotto. The difference comes when the draw begins. Rather than just drawing six balls, the draw goes on and more numbers are drawn until there is a winner. At least one player is guaranteed to win the entire jackpot every six hours. 
			</font>
			<br><br>	
			<font face="Times New Roman,Times">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					To add to the excitement of playing the new lotto games, players can watch the draw as it progresses. As more numbers are drawn your chances of winning accumulate. The more numbers that are drawn before a winner is found, the better your chances are.
 
			</font>
			<br><br>	
			<font face="Times New Roman,Times">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					The Lotto News Network will give you up-to-date information on the jackpots and draws of both the new games, all day every day. Experience the fun of 'Lotto Shoot Out' and 'Little Big One' Now!

<H4><u>Self-Advocacy</u></H4>
Growing into young adulthood presents challenges of coping with many issues and 
problems. Solving these issues and problems by being your own advocate is intervening
to influence the adversity.
<br>
<br>
Self-advocacy is a specific action and a process.  Thre is an adage which best describes this principle: give a fish to a hungry person and you will temporarily alleviate hunger; teach a hungry person to fish and you can help permanently alleviate the hnuger.  Alleviation of the hunger is the product or action of this intervention.  Teaching the hungry person to fish is the process.
<br>
<br>
Your needs are met by being informed of the resources available in your community.  The information as to what is provided is available and it si up to you to follow through and dvelop your own decision-making and problem-soving skills. Take personal responsibility for your own circumstances, recognize the causes and consequences of the problem, and develop the skills and knowledge edge necessary to approach and resolve these problems.
<br>
<br>
To access the system, use the tool of information by being awre of your local elected officials, school board trustees, counsellors, MLAs, and MPs.  Your school counsellors, teachers and principal, parents or  <a href="www.multimedia.edu/bicss/bicss.htm">Burnaby Information & Community Services Society</a> (299-5778) can assist you with this process.
<br>
<br>
You have a right as a citizen to contact your elected officials, teachers or school principal to cut through the system (red tape).

Assessing these avenues will provide you with an opportunity to develop the skills necessary to resolve future problems.  Self-advocacy represents the following princiles: empowerment, respect and self-efficiency.

<H4><u>Alcohol and Other Drugs</u></H4>
Some people experiment with drugs for curiosity, for kicks, because of peer pressure, 
or to escape emotional problems. Drugs change the way we act, think and feel. Some drugs 
cause depression; some make users feel invincible and can give them a false sense of security; 
some drugs make users feel that they can do anything. These feelings are often unpredictable.
<p>
The dangers of drug experimentation are:
<ul>
	<li>overdose
	<li>physical illness
	<li>use of impure or unknown drugs
	<li>addiction
	<li>impaired judgment
</ul>
<p>
Becoming dependent (getting hooked) on alcohol or drugs may happen immediately or gradually. 
Using drugs may kill you, especially when taken in excess or in the wrong combination. Drugs 
are very unpredictable and their effects on the body vary from person to person.
Alcohol is the most abused drug in Canada. Alcohol is a depressant (downer).
<p>
Alcohol affects parts of the brain and spinal cord in proportion to the amount of alcohol in 
bloodstream. Usual effects of small doses are euphoria, drowsiness, dizziness, flushing, and 
release of inhibitions and tensions. Larger doses produce slurred speech, staggering, double 
vision and stupor.
<p>
Alcohol, even in fairly low doses, impairs driving. In combination with other drugs, a small 
dose of alcohol may produce exaggerated effects.
Beginning 8 to 12 hours after consumption, excessive drinking may produce headache, nausea, 
shakiness and vomiting (hangover).Very large doses can cause death by blocking the brain's 
control over respiration.
<p>
The effect of alcohol may include:
<ul>
	<li>disruptions of drinker's social, family and school life
	<li>liver damage, brain damage
	<li>blackouts (loss of memory)
	<li>impotence, ulcers, disorders of the pancreas
	<li>heart disease
	<li>certain types of cancer
</ul>
<p>
Regular alcohol use induces tolerance, making increased doses necessary to produce the desired 
effect. Chronic users may drink steadily without appearing to get drunk. Their condition may 
go unrecognized, even by themselves, for some time. Chronic drinkers are likely to become 
physically and psychologically dependent. Withdrawal symptoms include jumpiness, sleeplessness, 
sweating and poor appetite, progressing to tremors, convulsions, hallucinations and even death.
<p>
<b>WARNING:</b>Alcohol is a dangerous drug. Games such as "chugging," "card games" and "quarters" 
can kill you.
<p>
<b>WARNING:</b>Drinking or using any drugs during pregnancy is extremely dangerous to the unborn 
baby. Pregnant women who drink excessively may have babies with abnormalities such as mental 
deficiencies, physical deformities or cardiac defects.
<p>
<b>WARNING:</b>Drinking and driving don't mix. It is an offense to drive with a Blood Alcohol 
Level (BAL) of .08% or greater, or to drive while impaired, even if one's BAL is less than .08%.
<p>
Fetal Alcohol Syndrome effects the unborn child.  When a woman drinks alcohol during pregnancy, 
it can physically or mentally damage her unborn baby (fetus).
The effects of alcohol on the unborn child may include;
<p>
<ul>
<li>mental retardation
<li>low birth weight
<li>small head and small build
<li>poor co-ordination
<li>joint problems
<li>heart defects
<li>seizures
<li>behavioural problems
<li>short attention span
</ul>
<p>
<b>WARNING:</b>There is no safe amount of alcohol for a pregnant woman to drink.  Even one 
drink a day may cause problems.  Marijuana (pot, grass, weed, reefer, ganja, joint) and hashish 
(known as hash) are generally smoked or eaten.  Getting high or stoned can make the user feel 
dull and sluggish for some time after. Concentration and short-term memory can be impaired. 
Physical effects include impaired coordination and balance, rapid heart beat, red eyes, dry 
mouth and throat, and drowsiness. THC, the active ingredient, has been detected in bodies of 
fatally injured drivers and pedestrians in Canada and the U.S.A.. The respiratory system can 
be damaged by smoking a single joint of marijuana as it yields twice as much tar as a strong 
cigarette. Studies suggest that normal growth of a baby can be adversely affected by use of 
marijuana during pregnancy.
<p>
The effects of marijuana may include:
<ul>
<li>loss of motivation and interest
<li>lung damage
<li>depression, anxiety, panic, terror, paranoia
<li>time distortion, short term memory loss
<li>impaired ability to drive
</ul>
<p>
Cocaine (C, coke, snow, nose candy) is snorted, injected or smoked. It acts as a stimulant (upper) of the central nervous system.
The effects resemble those of amphetamines with shorter duration. User feels euphoric, energetic, alert; has rapid heart beat and breathing, high body temperature, dilated pupils, sweating, pallor, and a decreased appetite. Large doses can cause erratic or violent behaviour, tremors, incoordination, twitching, hallucinations, pain or pressure in the chest, nausea, blurred vision, fever, muscle spasms, convulsions and death. Users may experience insomnia and stuffy nose as a "hangover" from cocaine.
Characteristic signs of chronic cocaine sniffing are stuffiness and runny nose, chapped nostrils, and perforation of nasal septum.
<p>
The effects of cocaine may include:
<ul>
<li>restlessness
<li>extreme excitability
<li>insomnia, paranoia
<li>hallucinations and delusions
<li>constipation, impotence, difficulty in urinating
</ul>
<p>
Crack is a form of cocaine which appears as small granules that are smoked in a glass pipe 
or tube. Because crack is more concentrated, its use can result in more severe consequences.
<p>
<b>WARNING:</b>Even first time use of cocaine or crack can cause death.
<p>
<b>WARNING:</b>Crack is highly addictive.  A first time user may become addicted.
<p>
<b>WARNING:</b>Freebasing cocaine can cause injury or death from fire or explosion.
<p>
Inhalants "sniffing" glue, aerosols (hairspray, Pam), nail polish, cleaning fluids or gasoline 
can produce mind-altering effects. The effects of abusing these chemicals can cause 
unconsciousness and death.  LSD (acid) is sold on the street as coloured drops on blotting 
paper, on gelatin sheets, and as tablets, capsules or liquid solutions.
The effects are felt within an hour, lasting up to 12 hours. Thinking and concentration 
become difficult, and short-term memory is impaired. Extreme mood swings, including joy, 
inspiration, depression, anxiety, terror and aggression, are common. The drug can induce 
confusion which can cause accidental death.
<p>
The effects of LSD may include:
<ul>
<li>decreased motivation and interest
<li>prolonged depression and anxiety
<li>flashbacks
<li>(LSD) "high" may spontaneously recur days, weeks or even months later
<li>fetal abnormality
</ul>
<p>
PCP (angel dust, elephant, hog) comes in powder form, in crystals, liquid, tablet, capsule 
or paste.  The effects last 3 to 18 hours. It produces a state of intoxication, a sense of 
separation from surroundings, perceptual distortions, and difficulty in concentrating and 
communicating. Users may become highly confused, paranoid, terrified, aggressive or passive. 
Overdose can cause convulsions, coma and death. Accidental death can result from drug-induced 
confusion.
<p>
The effects of PCP may include:
<ul>
<li>persistent speech problems
<li>depression, anxiety or more severe psychological problems Magic Mushrooms psilocybin 
(psilocin) is the active ingredient in several species of mushrooms and other fungi that grow 
throughout Canada.  The effects are felt after about half an hour, and last several hours. 
Symptoms may include fatigue, separation from surroundings, or a sense of heaviness or lightness.
</ul>
<p>
The effects of Magic Mushrooms may include:
<ul>
<li>perceptual distortions
<li>dizziness, abdominal discomfort
<li>numbness of the mouth
<li>nausea, shivering, flushing, sweating
</ul>
<p>
Heroin (H, horse, junk, smack) is fine white or brown powder, usually heavily diluted with powdered milk, sugar, quinine or other substances. It can be sniffed but is usually injected. It is a derivative of morphine, but proves to be more addictive and requires increased amounts to reach the same high. Newborn infants may suffer signs of withdrawal because of their mother's habit.
The effects of heroin may include:
<ul>
<li>user goes into stupor
<li>restlessness, nausea, vomiting
<li>severe constipation
<li>moodiness, menstrual irregularities
<li>insensitivity to pain, contraction of pupils
<li>cold, moist, bluish skin
<li>breathing may slow to complete stop,resulting in death Amphetamines (speed, bennies, ice) 
are uppers. These drugs cause hallucinations, delusions, and paranoia. Users may feel extremely 
anxious, fearful and suspicious.
</ul>
<p>
The effects of amphetamines may include:
<ul>
<li>malnutrition
<li>mental illness similar to paranoia
<li>prone to violence
</ul>
<p>
Prescription drugs (sleeping pills, pain killers, cold remedies, tranquilizers) can cure 
illness and block pain, and sometimes their beneficial effects are needed.
Prescription drugs can also cause dependency and side effects that interfere with life. 
Prescription drugs are not safe for use by anyone other than the person for whom they were 
prescribed.  
<p>
Tobacco (nicotine) is found in cigarettes, snuff and other tobacco products. A lighted 
cigarette generates 4000 different chemical compounds. Most smokers are physically and 
psychologically dependent on tobacco. Tar accumulates in the lungs. Inhaling smokers subject 
themselves and people around them to very high carbon monoxide levels. Those who quit smoking 
generally achieve the same health levels as non-smokers after a few years, although some damage 
may not be completely reversible.
<p>
Cigarette smoke can be unhealthy and irritating to non-smokers, in particular people with 
allergies, children and people who already have heart or lung disease. Laws and regulations 
restricting use of tobacco in public places have been introduced across Canada.
<p>
The effects of smoking may include:
<ul>
<li>increased heart rate and blood pressure
<li>drop in skin temperature
<li>faster breathing
<li>cancer of the lungs, mouth and throat
<li>respiratory disease
<li>blockage of blood vessels
<li>stomach ulcers
<li>each cigarette cuts 5.5 minutes from smoker's lifespan
</ul>
<p>
The babies of women who smoke tend to weigh less at birth than those of non-smokers; the risk 
of prematurity, miscarriage and stillbirth is greater. Studies suggest that a mother's smoking 
can have a detrimental effect on a child's growth, intellectual development and behaviour.
Caffeine is the world's most popular drug. It is found in coffee, tea, cocoa and cola drinks. 
It is also found in aspirin, non-prescription cough and cold remedies, diet pills and some 
street drugs. People who suddenly stop using caffeine after long term use experience withdrawal 
syndrome. The symptoms may include headaches, irritability and mood changes.
<p>
Getting help:  someone who abuses alcohol or other drugs may be unable to recognize the 
seriousness of their problem. It is important to seek information about how to get help for 
yourself or a friend. There are many positive alternatives to doing drugs. Help is available.

<H4><u>Counselling (Emotional Health)</u></H4>
Being emotionally (mentally) healthy means feeling reasonably good about yourself and others. 
It does not mean feeling good all the time. No one does. Everyone has strong feelings, 
particularly about the emotional issues facing them. You are not alone.
If bad feelings begin to interfere with your mental health and normal activities, 
they may be warning signs of emotional problems.
<p>
These warning signs include:
<ul>
<li>trouble dealing with parents or family
<li>sudden, extreme changes in mood or behaviour
<li>depression, prolonged unhappiness,withdrawal from friends and activities,and lack of 
interest
<li>feelings of uneasiness, fear or imagined danger
<li>jumpiness, irritability	
<li>increased physical health concerns
<li>not working up to potential in school or sports
<li>trouble sleeping/lack of appetite
</ul>
<p>
Emotional problems are not hopeless or incurable. An emotionally troubled person can get help.
COUNSELLING is a confidential opportunity to discuss personal issues with someone you can trust. 
You explain to a counsellor how you are feeling and why you think you are feeling that way. In 
the process of explaining those feelings, you can learn how to understand yourself better and 
how to make more knowledgeable decisions about your life.
<p>
Sometimes friends and relatives who are good listeners can help you make decisions. Trust your 
feelings and find someone who makes you feel comfortable.
If your problems seem too difficult or too personal to discuss with a friend or relative, then 
you may need to find a trained counsellor.
<p>
Mental health centres and other agencies provide counselling on issues such as:
<ul>
<li>loneliness
<li>difficulty with making friends
<li>drug or alcohol misuse/abuse
<li>sexuality
<li>peer pressure
<li>depression and anxiety
<li>confused thoughts, reality testing
<li>family problems
</ul>
<p>
Some agencies allow counsellors to see a teenager without parental permission. Call first to 
determine policies. Ask about special services for teens, fees and appointment times. Remember, 
don't let anything keep you from getting the help you deserve. For assistance in locating 
COUNSELLING, please call:<ul><li>your own family doctor<li>your school counsellor or community health nurse</ul>

<H4><u>Eating Disorders</u></H4>
Many young people mistakenly pursue a thin, muscular body in the belief that it is the "ideal" 
body shape. This unrealistic goal is reinforced by the fashion, fitness, mass media and tobacco 
industries in advertising their products. THERE IS IN FACT NO SINGLE IDEAL BODY SHAPE.
Two eating disorders related to the pursuit of the "ideal" body are threatening the health and 
happiness of young people today. They are Anorexia Nervosa and Bulimia. They can have devastating
effects on sufferers and their families. They can be fatal.
<p>
Anorexia Nervosa is a disorder characterized by an intense fear of becoming obese. Lack of 
self-esteem, depression and feeling fat in spite of noticeable thinness result in behaviours 
such as deliberate self-starvation, excessive exercising, "pickiness" in food choices and 
serious weight loss.
<p>
Bulimia is also characterized by an excessive concern about body weight and shape. Bulimics 
engage in recurrent episodes of binge eating which result in fear of being overweight. This is 
followed by weight control methods such as self-induced vomiting, fasting, use of diuretics, 
purging with laxatives and excessive exercising.
<p>

information and help by contacting:</b>

<H4><u>Car Accidents</u></H4>
WHAT TO DO IN CASE OF A CAR ACCIDENT:
DO NOT PANIC. Do not move your car until the police arrive unless it is causing a safety hazard.
<p>
Exchange the following information with the other driver:
<ul>
<li>year and make of car
<li>licence plate number
<li>driver's licence number
<li>name and address of driver
<li>telephone numbers - home/business
<li>name and address of vehicle owner
<li>name and address of witnesses
<li>police accident report number
</ul>
Write a description of how the accident happened, include time, date and location.

<H4><u>Multiculturalism</u></H4>
The Burnaby and New Westminster communities are made up of many different nationalities. People from around the world choose to live here. Some immigrants and new Canadians have a difficult time adjusting to their new surroundings. There are several organizations that can help to assist with adjustments to life in Canada.
<p>
Multicultural societies develop educational programs and services, in response to community needs, to promote the integration and full participation of all ethnocultural groups into the life of the community.

<H4><u>Racism</u></H4>
Racism is more than telling ethnic jokes. It is a deep-rooted attitude which influences the way people view the world and upon which they base their personal interactions. Racist ideas fall on a continuum starting with stereotypes and biases to fully developed theories of racist superiority which may be held unconsciously.
<p>
The racism most of us encounter on a day-to-day basis is usually subtle.
<p>
Our physical features and how people react to us heavily influences how we view ourselves. Subtle forms of racism, like racist jokes, insidiously attack a person's identity, eat at one's self esteem, invade one's dreams and can render a person helpless to self determine.
<p>
Adults do not necessarily have a monopoly on racism. Youth who themselves are forming an identity and questioning the status quo in so many area can be cruel and heartless, unthinkingly perpetuating racial myths and racist behaviour.
<p>
Do not minimize the importance of dealing with racism. If you feel you are subject to racism, you should speak to someone about it. Your close friends sometimes do not even understand how something which seems harmless to them can affect you negatively.
A school counsellor, a teacher whom you trust, or a parent who can empathize may be able to help develop strategies to deal with racism. There are also community and provincial organizations which have expertise in this area and may be able to guide you.
If you recognize racism in yourself, you too need help. It is not healthy to find your own identity and power by ridiculing or destroying someone else's. Speak about it with someone who can help.

<H4><u>Sexual Assault/Rape</u></H4>
Sexual assault is any forced or coerced sexual act. It can be anything from unwanted touching to rape. It is an act of violence and abuse of power, not just the result of an uncontrollable sex urge. While anyone can commit a sexual assault, over half of all sexual assaults occur between people who know each other.
<p>
Rapists choose victims who are vulnerable. Victims are often vulnerable because they know and trust their assailants. However, be sensible and avoid isolated places.
<p>
Date Violence:  Understand that men and women have a right to set personal sexual limits  and that "NO" means "NO";
<ul>
<li>don't assume that flirtatious behaviour is a signal for sex
<li>clearly communicate your limits, "ESP" does not work
<li>do not confuse "scoring" with having a successful social encounter
<li>do not respond to pressured sex as a means of developing a relationship
<li>be aware of vulnerable situations and have alternatives, 
<li>react negatively to unwanted physical and sexual pressure
</ul>

TRUST YOUR INSTINCTS
Avoid drugs and alcohol - 75% of males and 55% of females who were involved in acquaintance rapes had been drinking or taking drugs just before the sexual attack.
<p>
If you are assaulted, do whatever you need to do to get out alive. Afterwards, go to a safe place and call for assistance:

<H4><u>Suicide Prevention</u></H4>
Some teenagers go through life hiding their problems and feelings from the world, their families and their friends. If someone talks to you about suicide, take it seriously. People need to talk to someone if they can't cope with life. A friend may tell you about suicidal feelings and ask you to keep it a secret. Being a good friend means that YOU WILL NOT KEEP THIS A SECRET.
<p>
You must tell someone you can trust (parent, teacher, member of the clergy or counsellor). Suicide threats are cries for help from people who don't realize that they have other choices.
<p>
Mentioning suicide does not give people the idea or push them over the edge. Talking frankly permits people to discuss painful feelings and can prevent them from committing suicide. This period of crisis usually lasts a short time. With help, people can get past their crisis period and start to work through the feelings and problems that are bothering them.
Anyone has the potential to commit suicide.
<p>
Here are a few ways to help someone who is feeling suicidal:
<uL>
<li>be willing to listen
<li>don't make the person feel guilty about his/her feelings
<li>get help by encouraging the person to call a suicide prevention crisis line or to seek professional counselling
</ul>
<p>
If you have any questions about suicide, or are experiencing a crisis in your life that seems too difficult to handle, you can call these numbers for help:

<H4><u>Social Activities</u></H4>
It is important to put aside some time for yourself. Have fun, go out and meet others. Make new friends.
Volunteering is one way for you to join forces with people who make good things happen. It is also a way to learn new skills and explore possible careers.
<p>
A good track record of volunteer activities is valuable work experience. Become involved with your school, church, youth group or through your local volunteer centre.
Burnaby Volunteer Centre 	294-5533
Greater Coquitlam Volunteer Centre 	524-9808
<p>
The agencies listed below are good places to find adventure, hang out, meet people, dance, listen to music and talk. They have people there who are interested in helping kids grow and enjoy life.

During the last four years, PreText has produced high-quality written content for a number of the world's best-known creators of CD-ROM titles and Web, including Microsoft, Starwave, and Amazon.com.

As Lewis Carroll's Alice In Wonderland opens, a bored Alice sits on a river bank with nothing to do: "Once or twice she had peeped into a book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, 'and what is the use of a book,'" thought Alice, 'without pictures or conversations?'" <P>

That was 130 years ago. With the birth of multimedia, the book Alice longed for has arrived. At its best, multimedia combines words, video, sound, photographs, images, and animation to provide a sumptuous, interactive banquet of ideas and information for the mind and the senses. <P>

But it is a medium still very much in its infancy. Much of what is produced focuses too much on technical wizardry for its own sake. Too often forgotten is the fact that at its best, multimedia is still a storytelling medium. Even in the "nuggetized" world of Web sites where information is often conveyed in short chunks, narrative flow and dramatic momentum are crucial. <P>

At PreText we have been exploring multimedia as a narrative art form for four years. We are experts in the alchemical process of combining storytelling and technology to create compelling and engaging entertainment created specifically for the multimedia environment. <P>

At PreText our expertise is in storytelling and writing; the art of crafting narrative that brings a Web site or a CD-ROM title to life. During the past two years we've worked to develop relationships with creative people who are exploring the boundaries of interactive media. The result is a virtual multimedia studio of skilled and experienced writers, designers, and developers who share our belief in compelling storytelling. We feel strongly that this collaborative, studio approach is the key to creating great multimedia products.
 
<P>
Our strategic partners include Workshop 4, Inc., a multimedia design firm headed up by Charles Willi. Before starting Workshop 4, Willi designed Microsoft Complete Baseball and Microsoft Complete NBA Basketball. Recent Workshop 4 projects include The Wilderness Game, an interactive educational kiosk created for the National Park Service; Complete Reference Library, a CD-ROM reference title published by Mindscape; and the Doonesbury Web site. 
<P>

Other strategic partners include Kopetz Bolich Design, designers of PreText's serial comedy Silicon Fusion; Twister Technologies, a Seattle firm specializing in HTML and back-end programming; and Matt Bennett a multimedia developer with experience in a broad range of development platforms, and special expertise in interactive training.

Dear Hunter:<BR> 

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
I <I>am</I> sorry that it took so long to arrange for your release. I was stunned that the prosecutor requested bail of $5 million. I must say you didn't do yourself any favors when you locked yourself in your office during the search. Although now I know why you didn't want them to have access to your hard drive. Some of the files might be in violation of the Interstate Electronic Transmission of Smutty Images Act.<BR> 

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Here is the status of the case: Apparently, each of your previous three products contains hidden lines of code pertaining to the latest developments in a variety of esoteric scientific fields. In SumWare, for example, a user who knows the proper sequence of keyboard commands can access hidden functions that solve complex equations in bio-thermoplastics. (Strange, given that the original release of SumWare randomly converted decimal points to commas and added three zeros, making it difficult even to balance a checkbook.) <BR>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
According to my sources, CIA operatives have found that an anti-government group in Hoezbagistan (see attached) is using these codes to develop sophisticated missiles for use against Western businesses, specifically targeting fast-food establishments. <BR>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Most of the materials seized last week will be returned tomorrow, except 1) records of Dede Thibodeau's trip through Central Asia last year; 2) all of the correspondence and technical work for the last two years from Victor Gooseggi and an employee named &quot;Chris&quot; (do you have any idea what Chris's last name is?); and 3) your hard drive. <BR>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Sometime in the next month, the FBI will want to speak with Victor and Chris. Prosecutors may request that Dede return to this country for questioning.<BR> 
In the meantime, you might want to see what you can find out about the hidden functionality in your products. And I'd suggest you confine your Internet surfing to sports and travel.<P> </BLOCKQUOTE>

Beifdzhurki, Hoezbagistan -- Insurgent rebels conducted a surprise pre-dawn attack on a cluster of Western fast-food establishments in this capital city today, according to an unnamed spokesman in the State Department. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
No one was hurt in the raid but breakfast was an hour late. There were unconfirmed reports of widespread looting in the city's onion-ring district. &quot;This place is chaos,&quot; said an anonymous junior attache attache at the embassy in Beifdzhurki. &quot;Believe me, this is not what I in mind when I took the Foreign Service exam.&quot;

A rebel group called the Hoezbagi Insurgent Faction Against the Colonial Hegemonist's Odious Waste (HIFAT CHOW) claimed responsibility for the attack in a letter to the BASS News Agency. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Hoezbagistan is yet another country created by the breakup of the former Soviet Union. U.S. officials seeking closer economic ties with the fledgling republic are encouraging fast-food restaurants to establish a commercial beachhead in hopes of averting an election-year junta. But as Walter Walhenstan, a professor of Hoezbagistan studies at the University of Rural Wyoming, said, &quot;We don't like corndogs here. What makes you think they'll go for 'em over there?&quot; 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
In a written communiqu&eacute;, rebel leader Suliman Gooseggi said the guerrillas are fighting to restore and preserve the country's culinary heritage against Hoezbagi modernists who favor Western cooking. &quot;Besides,&quot; the Stanford-educated Gooseggi added, &quot;corndogs make me sick!&quot; 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Western diplomats report that a &quot;grease-seeking&quot; missile scored a direct hit on the deep-fat fryer in use at Porkfinger, one of the restaurants involved. It is believed that HIFAT CHOW may have illegally obtained the lipid-locating technology from an American company. According to sources at the Justice Department, an investigation of that company may soon lead to arrests. They declined to name the company, however. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Officials also declined to say whether drugs or Pat Sajak were involved. Meanwhile, a U.S. Congressman campaigning in Vermont blamed pregnant poor people for the attack. <BR>

<P>
Dear Ms. Mentz,<BR>

<P>
Thank you for dropping by our office last week. I am rolling a cigarette now. After consulting with my colleague, Hiram Rabinowitz, I have decided to take on your case. <BR>

<P>
How sorry I was to hear of the disappearance of your son, Randy, into the clutches of the Anka-Right Society. How terrible for you this must be. I am now shaping the cigarette into a fine cylinder with my slender, manicured fingers. My research into this cult shows that they exhibit a deranged fascination with the famous pop singer of the 1970s, Paul Anka. They believe that the lyrics to Anka's hit tunes, such as &quot;Havin' My Baby,&quot; &quot;One Man Woman, One Woman Man,&quot; and &quot;Lonely Boy,&quot; contain certain keys to successful living that only those with the proper awareness can decode. <BR>

<P>
I am now lighting the cigarette with my engraved platinum Zippo. The smoke curls mysteriously above my glossy, razor-cut hairstyle. <BR>

<P>
I think, Candace--may I call you that?--that we can find your son. Discreet inquiries have traced the Anka cult to the Haight-Ashbury district of San Francisco. Luckily my colleague, Hiram, has close ties with the San Francisco P.D. vice squad. I am exhaling through my sculpted nostrils. We are now commencing this inquiry. As you know, our fees are $200 per day plus expenses. We will let you know when we have achieved results in this important investigation.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
Warmest salutations,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

<P>
Dear Mom and Dad:<BR>

<P>
Exciting news! Today Candy Mentz, one of the VPs around here, asked me to sit in on a meeting for this new product called No!Ware. Granted, she only wanted me to take notes, but the prospect was a lot more interesting than making coffee, which is what I mostly did until the FBI confiscated the coffee maker. <BR>

<P>
Anyway, during the meeting, Victor Gooseggi--a brilliant developer who's from Hoezbagistan (sorry Dad, I know you don't like to be reminded about bailing me out of jail at 3 in the morning)--pointed at me and said, &quot;We need perspective of spring chicken to this place. Which road is No!Ware going in your mind?&quot; <BR>

<P>
You would have been proud of me!! I told them Silicon Fusion has a corporate responsibility to ensure that in the new information age, people aren't polarized into haves and have nots. Candy looked displeased, but Victor said I had &quot;hit the pail with the bread,&quot; which I took as a compliment. He also put me in charge of what he called the &quot;Disadvantaged Outreachment for Differently Unabled Usability Testing and Enfranchisement of All the World's Peoples Committee.&quot; I'm still a little unclear on what he has in mind, but I'm excited anyway.<BR>

<P>
Not too much else to report. I haven't heard from Clive in weeks. I hate to say it Mom, but maybe you were right about him.<BR>

<P>
Hope you both are doing well! Write soon--and since I don't get my first check for a couple of weeks, any extra $$ you could send would be appreciated!! <BR>

<P>
Love ya!! xxoo<BR>

<P>
To wend your way through our story, just click on the items below. For some background information on our cast of characters, try the &quot;Personnel&quot; files. 
<P>
<B>And now, to the business at hand . . . </B>
<P As our drama begins, Silicon Fusion's tyrannical, cigar-puffing,  suspender-wearing president has hired a new administrative assistant  to replace the last one he scared away.  <P>
Meanwhile, the Silicon Fusion brain trust (we use the term &quot;brain trust&quot; loosely) is struggling to find a way to squeeze enough work out of the company's under-motivated employees to get a new product out the door before the firm's financial backers pull the plug once and for all.
<P>
And, as if that wasn't enough, the results of a Justice Department investigation into Silicon Fusion's relationship with a group of culinary guerrillas in a certain small but strategically located former Soviet Republic are about to be revealed . . .
<P>
<B>So, without further ado, we present Silicon Fusion!</B>

Subj: Temporary Assignment
<br>
Date: 96-12-04 13:23:48 EST
<br>
From: zeldam@temptress.com (Zelda Marcos, President, Temptress, Inc.)
<br>
To: ravennaf@hyperlink.com

<P>
Dear Ms. Furlong:<BR>

<P>
I'm pleased to inform you that the Temptress agency has secured a temporary full-time position for you. The job is with Silicon Fusion, a leading high-tech firm. You are to act as administrative assistant to Hunter Highbridge, president of Silicon Fusion. He requested someone who is bright and motivated with strong interpersonal, communication and organizational skills, a solid background in word processing, and some marketing experience. But everyone wants caviar at cat food prices, don't they?<BR>

<P>
Your part-time jobs at Clothed Minds and Chai High Caf&eacute; during the 18 months since you graduated from Swale College didn't precisely qualify you, but we were able to convince Mr. Highbridge of your suitability for this position. The fact that you were editor of the <I>Swale Daily Mudraker </I>seemed to satisfy them on the communications skills front. I was able to make your senior project (<I>Breaking the Frame: Images of Ritual Abuse and Patriarchal Domination in the Paintings of Norman Rockwell)</I> sound like a level-headed exploration of American art history. I managed to gloss over your arrest outside the embassy of that former Soviet republic last spring. (Which one was it? Kohlrabistan? Rutabagastan?) <BR>

<P>
Mr. Highbridge has indicated that there is no dress code at Silicon Fusion, but I would suggest that you not change your hair color too often early on. <BR>

<P>
You are to start on Monday. Please call me to confirm your acceptance of the offer. <BR>

<P>

Dear Ravenna:
<P>
How nice to get an "e-mail letter" from you. It was so good of you and your brother to show us how to go "on-line." It makes your father and I feel so "with-it" and "wired."
<P>
It sure is great, honey, that you found a "real job!" I just knew that if you kept at it, something real good would come along. 
<P>
I know I shouldn't "nag" but I just wanted to remind you how important it is to "make a good impression" at your new job. I know that all the kids are "doing it" these days, but I just don't think it's such a good idea for you to wear that ring through your nose. It just gives people the "wrong impression."
<P>
That's all for now. Your father says to say "hello."
<P>
Love,
<P>
Mom

This time, we've got the right product at the right time. If we ship our new Internet security application No!Ware soon, we can leverage our positioning and maximize the potential upside to seize the strategic high ground and establish dominance in this critical space in the marketplace.
<P>
If not . . . well let's just say that some of you are going to be looking for jobs before I go crawling back to my in-laws for yet another infusion of capital. 

<P>
It's time we rededicated ourselves to the value of a good 18-hour work day. If we're going to meet this deadline, we're going to have to maximize the work ethic around here. I'd like everyone to spend a little less time cheering on the company Ultimate Frisbee team and a little more time making the Ultimate Sacrifice; a little less hacky-sacking in the hallways and a little more hacking at the computer terminals. Got it?

<P>
To kick things off, I'm scheduling a company-wide meeting for next Wednesday. I want this to be part rally, part harangue. Time to put a little fear back in the workplace. Like I always say, "Meaningful Threats + Empty Promises = Improved Productivity."
<P>
Here's my outline for the meeting. <P>
<OL>
<LI>Opening Remarks--Candy: Digital Convergence Means War. Introduce me.
<LI>Cue Music : "Nowhere Man" (Roscoe: Find some third-rate rock group to record the first few lines with the last word changed: "He's a real No!Ware man. Sitting in his No!Ware land. Making all his No!Ware plans. For EVERYONE.")
<LI>I take the stage dressed in commando black. Either A) I get lowered from the rafters with a knife between my teeth, or B) I come out with three Dobermans straining at the leash. Flash pots might be good, too.
<LI>Life-sized dummy of the chairman of our arch rival MindWarp tossed on stage. Dogs rip it to shreds. (Smear it with hamburger first?)
<LI>I give speech. (Roscoe: Find me a copy of the movie <I> Patton.</I>)
<LI>Candy tears off blazer and blouse to reveal "We're going No!Ware. Fast!" T-shirt.
<LI>Roscoe, Victor toss No!Ware Fast T-shirts to crowd.
<LI>Closing chant: "Where are we going?" "No!Ware" "When are we going?" "Now!"

Re: Justice Department Action <P>


Dear Hunter:<P>
You'd better clear your schedule for the next couple of weeks. Attached is a copy of a document I received today. Apparently, the Justice Department is instituting legal action against you and Silicon Fusion for supplying restricted technology to a rebel group in one of the former Soviet republics. As best as I can make out, this rebel group is waging holy war against the spread of Western fast food into their country, and somehow, they're using Silicon Fusion technology to further their cause. I'm assuming that this is some kind of misunderstanding. Given your company's history of &quot;technological innovations,&quot; it's hard to imagine what this rebel group has that could possibly be a threat to anyone but themselves. <P>
Still, I advise you to treat this with the utmost seriousness. If convicted, you could face up to 30 years in prison. The fines could wipe out Silicon Fusion and take a big chunk out of your wife's trust fund as well. I pulled some strings at the Justice Department to forestall your arrest and the summary closure of Silicon Fusion. In the meantime, you better do some digging to find out what this is all about.<P>
By the way, where the hell is Hoezbagistan?<P>

Clive:
<P>
You better answer my e-mail one of these days, or I'll find 
myself another bass player.
<P>
Well . . . Another 45 minutes and I will have survived Week 1 
at my new job. 
<P>
There was a big company meeting on Wednesday, like some sort of 
fascist pep rally or something. Highbridge (I told you about 
him . . . small man, big ego) strides onstage dressed like 
Rambo. One of the vice presidents followed close behind with a 
pack of Dobermans foaming at the mouth. A dummy was tossed on 
stage and the VP let the dogs loose. But they went after 
Highbridge instead of the dummy. (Maybe someone said "get the 
dummy," and they got confused!) Apparently, Highbridge had 
rubbed hamburger on the dummy, but forgot to wash his hands. 
Fortunately, the doctors were able to re-attach his pinky. 
<P>
I like the technology guy, Victor Gooseggi. He's one of those 
brilliant migrs from the former Soviet Union. Hoezbagistan, 
in fact. Remember, I got arrested at the demonstration outside 
the Hoezbagistan Embassy last year? Anyway, he has this 
charming habit of butchering Americanisms. I asked him why he 
looked so glum the other day and he said. "Oh it is to nothing. 
Is only I wake up on wrong side of dread." 
<P>
So when are you coming back? You said that Land Mine's "World" 
tour of the Upper Midwest was only going to last three weeks 
and you've been gone for almost two months. If you're not back 
soon, I'm going to shave off the rest of my hair.
<P>
Hold on, there seems to be some kind of commotion in the lobby 
. . . I'll be right back.
<P>
. . . whoa . . . gotta run. There are about 20 federal agents 
in the lobby and they've got a search warrant. Something about 
a violation of the transfer of military technologies act or 
something. More later . . . 
<P>
Much love,
<P>
Ravenna

<h2>Diagnostic <a name="Evaluation">Evaluation</a> of the Dog
with Clinical Signs Indicative of Hyperadrenocorticism</h2>
<p>If hyperadrenocorticism is suspected in a patient based on
history, physical examination, and clinical signs, initial
laboratory tests should be performed to aid in differentiation of
other concurrent disease processes. </p>
<p>Once a presumptive diagnosis is made, screening tests should
be performed in order to establish a diagnosis of
hyperadrenocorticism. If, based on screening tests, the diagnosis
is established, additional diagnostic tests are performed in
order to aid in the differentiation of dogs with
pituitary-dependent hyperadrenocorticism (Cushing's disease) from
dogs with functional adrenal tumors. </p>
<p>Note: Patients with a history of recent or repetitive
exogenous corticosteroid administration and clinical signs and
laboratory abnormalities consistent with hyperadrenocorticism
should be tapered from corticosteroids for a period of two weeks,
and then remain off of corticosteroids for a period of six weeks
prior to performing screening tests. The ACTH stimulation test
can be used to differentiate iatrogenic hyperadrenocorticism from
the naturally occurring disease. Treatment for dogs diagnosed as
having iatrogenic hyperadrenocorticism involves tapering and
discontinuation of medications containing corticosteroids. </p>

<p><strong>DESCRIPTION: <br>
</strong>ANIPRYL&#174; (selegiline hydrochloride) 2 mg, 5 mg, 10
mg, 15 mg, and 30 mg tablets are almost white, flat tablets
containing 2, 5 10, 15 or 30 mg of the 1-isomer of selegiline HC1
(1-deprenyl HC1). The inactive ingredients are Lactose, Starch,
Povidone, Magnesium Stearate, and Talc. </p>
<p><strong>ACTION: <br>
</strong>ANIPRYL&#174; has been shown to be effective treatment
for pituitary dependent hyperadrenocorticism (PDH) in dogs as
demonstrated by amelioration of clinical signs and improved
regulation of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis. In
each of three clinical trials there was a progressive improvement
in endocrine function, as documented by results of low dose
dexamethasone suppression (LDDS) tests (1,2). Significant
clinical improvement was also demonstrated (1,2). Typical
clinical signs of PDH include polydipsia, polyuria, increased
frequency of urination and loss of housetraining, panting,
reduced activity, changes in sleep patterns, altered appetite,
obesity, alopecia, abdominal distention, reduced skin elasticity,
thin skin, and poor hair growth (1-3). In clinical trials, dogs
with PDH treated with ANIPRYL&#174; exhibited decreased body
weight and improved body conformation determined by measurement,
as well as amelioration of dermatologic signs (skin thickness and
elasticity, alopecia, pyoderma), and regrowth of hair (1,2).
Quality of life/general health was significantly improved based
on increased behavioral and cognitive responses such as higher
activity level, increased interaction with and responsiveness to
the owner, decreased polydipsia and panting, improved
housetraining habits and sleep patterns (1,2). </p>
<p>The LDDS test is used to confirm dysregulation of the HPA
axis, and to monitor endocrinologic response to therapy with
ANIPRYL&#174; (1,2,4). Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)
secretion from the pars intermedia of the canine pituitary gland,
and corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) mediated ACTH release
from the pars distalis are tonically inhibited by central nervous
system dopamine levels (5-7). Loss of this tonic inhibition
results in increased secretion of ACTH, which results in adrenal
hyperplasia and increased production of cortisol (7).
Hypothalamic dopamine concentrations are decreased in dogs with
PDH (8). Selegiline helps restore depleted central dopamine
levels and facilitates dopaminergic transmission by several
mechanisms, especially potent selective, irreversible inhibition
of MAOB (1,9). Selegiline also increases the synthesis and
release of dopamine into the synapse, and inhibits dopamine
reuptake (9). Selegiline or its metabolites may enhance release
of other neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine (9). </p>
<p>In the clinical trials noted above, dogs treated with
ANIPRYL&#174; exhibited progressive improvement in neuroendocrine
function, as demonstrated by improvement (normalization in some
patients) of LDDS test results (1,2). The precise mechanism for
this continued improvement is unknown, but may involve
neuroprotection or nerve rescue, in addition to the mechanisms
noted above. Experiments in laboratory animals demonstrated that
selegiline enhanced the survival of neurons after nerve trauma or
exposure to neurotoxins (10,11). </p>
<p>Canine PDH is a neuroendocrine disease which shares numerous
features in common with several neurodegenerative disorders
(2,12). For example, behavioral signs and cognitive impairment in
subjects with HPA axis dysregulation may resemble some of the
behavioral and cognitive impairments in people with Parkinson's
or Alzheimer' s disease (12,13). Clinical trials in people with
these disorders have demonstrated that selegiline improves
cognitive and other CNS functions (14,15). Studies in laboratory
and pet dogs have also revealed age associated cognitive
dysfunction which is responsive to selegiline therapy (13,16,17). </p>
<p>Some neurodegenerative diseases, especially Parkinson's
disease, may represent abnormally rapid brain aging (18).
Parkinsonian patients treated with selegiline lived longer than
those not receiving the drug (19). Furthermore, laboratory
animals treated with selegiline exhibited significantly longer
life compared to placebo treated animals (20). </p>
<p><strong>TOXICITY: <br>
</strong>Selegiline hydrochloride was administered orally to
beagle dogs once daily for one year at doses of 0, 1, 4 or 16
mg/kg. The no effect level was found to be 1 mg/kg. The following
clinical signs were noted in some dogs at higher doses:
salivation, panting, repetitive movements, decreased weight gain
and changes in activity level. </p>
<p><strong>INDICATIONS: <br>
</strong>ANIPRYL&#174; tablets are indicated for the treatment of
uncomplicated canine pituitary dependent hyperadrenocorticism.
They are not indicated for treatment of other forms of Cushing's
syndrome. </p>
<p><strong>PRECAUTIONS: <br>
</strong>Endocrine function testing to confirm pituitary
dependent hyperadrenocorticism should be performed by a licensed
veterinarian prior to initiation of therapy. If complications of
PDH are evident at the time of diagnosis or emerge during
ANIPRYL&#174; therapy the patient should be evaluated and, if
warranted, alternative therapy considered. Concurrent use of
ANIPRYL&#174; in conjunction with other therapy of canine PDH has
not been reported. ANIPRYL&#174; should not be administered at
doses exceeding those recommended. </p>
<p><strong>REPRODUCTION: <br>
</strong>The effect of ANIPRYL&#174; on reproduction in the bitch
has not been determined. </p>
<p><strong>CONTRAINDICATIONS: <br>
</strong>ANIPRYL&#174; is contraindicated in patients with known
hypersensitivity to this drug. Controlled studies to determine
the interaction of selegiline when administered with other drugs
have not been conducted in dogs. To date, patients enrolled in
clinical trials have not been reported to exhibit adverse drug
interactions with heartworm prophylaxis, a variety of
antimicrobials, anthelmenthics and analgesics. Concurrent use of
selegiline with other MAO inhibitors, such as Amitraz, is not
recommended. In humans, selegiline is contraindicated for use
with meperidine and this contraindication is often extended to
other opioids. Further experience in humans has revealed adverse
interactions between nonspecific MAO inhibitors and tricyclic
antidepressants such as fluoxetine. Although to date no such
interaction has been reported for selegiline in any nonhuman
species, it seems prudent to avoid such combinations in dogs. </p>
<p><strong>SIDE EFFECTS: <br>
</strong>During clinical trials eighty seven dogs treated with
ANIPRYL&#174; for as long as 2 years were monitored for the
occurrence of adverse events. No serious adverse events thought
to be related to ANIPRYL&#174; therapy were reported and no
adverse drug interactions were reported. </p>
<p><strong>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION: <br>
</strong>After confirmation of the diagnosis of PDH,
ANIPRYL&#174; is recommended orally once daily at an initial dose
of 1 mg/kg (0.45 mg/lb) body weight. During the first two months
of therapy, the patient should be re-evaluated periodically for
clinical response by history and physical examination. If no
improvement in clinical signs or physical examination findings is
evident by 2 months the dose can be increased to a maximum of 2
mg/kg once daily, and the dog re-evaluated in similar fashion one
month later. If there is still no improvement or if at any time
clinical signs progress, the patient should be evaluated for the
presence of concurrent disorders, including performance of
appropriate laboratory tests or other studies as warranted. In
dogs whose clinical signs of PDH progress despite ANIPRYL&#174;
therapy in the absence of concurrent disease, alternative therapy
should be considered. </p>
