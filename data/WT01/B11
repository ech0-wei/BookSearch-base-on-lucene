<HR>

<H1> NSU - First Manufacturer of Wankel Rotary Engines </H1>

<P> NSU was founded in 1873 and moved to Neckarsulm in Lower Swabia in
1880.  It wasn't until 1892 that it got the name NSU.  Motorcycles were
first produced in 1901.  Cars and trucks were produced from 1905 through
the end of the 1920s.  In 1955 it was the largest motorcycle
manufacturer in the world.

<H2> Early Research </H2>

<P> In 1951 contacts were established with <A
HREF="dr-wankel.html">Felix Wankel</A>.  Dr-Ing. Walter Froede was the
first to visit.  He was director of NSU's motorcycle racing program.  It
was his recommendation that led to NSU's collaboration with Wankel.

<P> Wankel's first work was on rotary valves and rotary superchargers.
One of his designs was attached to a 50cc NSU motorcycle, boosting the
air pressure 45psi to increase the horsepower to 13.5 bhp.  This cycle
set a world speed record for its class of 120 mph at the Bonneville salt
flats.

<P> By 1953 Froede had become head of research and development.  NSU's
head engineer was against rotary engine development, but a year later
Wankel and Froede persuaded the board to allow engine research if Wankel
would share the patents and not receive any increase in consulting fees.
Wankel was able to hire his long time associate, Ernst H&ouml;ppner.
After discarding a four-lobed design the three-lobed rotor in a two
lobed epitrochoid [<A HREF = "glossary.html#epitrochoid">gloss</A>] was
born as the <A HREF="rce.html#DKM">DKM</A> 54.

<H2> Early Success </H2>

<P> Testing began in January 1957.  Unfortunately management had
personality conflicts with Wankel so he was not invited on February 1,
1957 when the DKM 54 was fired up for the first time on the third try.
The fuel was based on methanol.  Gasoline was first used in April,
yielding 15 bhp at 9000 rpm.  The engine ran for two hours by the
end of May at 21 bhp.  By June 1958 it had survived a 100 hour test.

<P> Froede had the insight to perform a design inversion on the engine,
resulting in the <A HREF="rce.html#KKM">KKM category</A>, which quickly
completely dominated the field.  Wankel did not like this variation
because it was less smooth, and had more sealing problems since the apex
seals experienced greater forces because the rotor orbited the
stationary gear.  However it had other advantages, not the least of
which was the engine did not have to be disassembled to change the spark
plugs (though the first KKM did have plugs in the rotor).

<H2> Licensing Supports NSU </H2>

<P> The motorcycle industry was changing as incomes increased and cars
became more affordable.  NSU began adapting by introducing a two
cylinder car in 1958.  However, Wankel RCE licensing fees were an
important means of staying afloat.  Curtiss-Wright became the first
licensor on Oct. 21, 1958 and made <A
HREF="engines.html#Curtiss-Wright">a large commitment</A> to the RCE.

<P> NSU was very astute in requiring license holders to share research
results with all others (although <A HREF="corvette.html">GM</A>
obtained an exemption).  This was important because there were only
seven years between the first firing and the first production
automobile.  Plucky NSU and its licensors had to compete with about a
hundred years of development of the reciprocating engine.  Early on NSU
was shocked by how quickly <A HREF="mazda.html">Toyo Kogyo (Mazda)</A>
was developing engines.  This spurred NSU on because Mazda did not have
to pay any fees until NSU offered a car for sale that could reliably run
50,000 kilometres.

<H2> <A NAME="Spider"> NSU Spider 1964-1967 </H2>

<P> NSU road tested the Wankel in 1960 for the first time.  Later that
year they showed a preliminary version of the Spider, a descendant of
the Sport Prinz at a Munich meeting of German engineers.  Wankel spoke
to the conference and won over the many skeptics in the audience.

<PRE>
Displacement      1 x 497 cc
Horsepower        50 bhp at 5000 rpm, 54 bhp at 6000 rpm
Torque            52 lb-ft at 2500 rpm, 54 at 3000, 57 at 3500 rpm
Top Speed         95 mph
</PRE>

<P> The Spider competed with the Austin Healey Sprite, which had 5 more
horses, but the same top speed.  It was about 4 % more expensive than
the Austin and 16 % more expensive than the Fiat 850 Spider.  About 2375
were produced, although figures of 3000 and 5000 have been reported.

<H2> <A NAME="Ro80"> NSU Ro80 1968-1977 </H2>

<P> Development began in August 1961 and it was officially shown at the
1967 Frankfurt Auto Show.  Originally it was to have a two rotor engine
with 2 x 300 cc capacity.

<P> The design of the Ro80 was quite advanced for its time.  It was
front wheel drive.  Suspension was fully independent.  It had four-wheel
disk brakes with dual circuits as a safety feature.  Aerodynamic drag
coefficient was 0.35, amazingly low for its time, though this was
ultimately 0.39 with larger tires and cooling openings.  Though weight
distribution was 63/37 front/rear it handled very well.  Chief stylist
was Claus Luthe.

<P> About 33,900 were produced.  A three rotor successor was being
readied in 1969, but about this time NSU was swallowed by Volkwagen /
Audi.  Peter Hofbauer made a five chamber KKM which later became a
compressor.  His design is said to be the only RCE without a low
pressure stage to function as a diesel engine.  Political intrigue,
financial pressures and conservatism at VW snuffed out rotary
development.

<PRE>
Displacement      2 x 497 cc
Horsepower 1973   115 bhp DIN at 5000 or 5500 rpm (or 129 hp at 5500, 1967)
Torque            112 lb-ft at 4500 rpm
Weight            2955 lb (or 2668 lb)
Top Speed         112 mph
Price             DM 14,150
</PRE>

<H2> <A NAME="TowBoat"> NSU Skier Controlled Tow Boat </H2>

3000 were built.  They had a KKM 150 engine.

<H2> <A NAME="Ro135"> NSU Ro135 Marine Engine </H2>

<H2> NSU History </H2>

<P> NSU has its history recounted on an interesting page titled "<A
HREF="http://motorcycle.com/mo/mcmuseum/nsu.html">The Rise and Fall of
the NSU Empire</A>: From Knitting Machines to World Championships and
Finally Obscurity".  Unfortunately there is scant mention of the rotary.

subsequently killed by schrapnel at Dornach (Elsass (Alsace?)) in World
War I as an Oberleutnant, and <A
HREF="http://www.genealogy.com/gastel/0200/fam0283.htm">Martha Gertrud
Heidlauff</A> (1879-?).  Dr. Wankel passed away on October 9, 1988,
Lindau, W. Germany, where he did much of his research and where
Wankel R&D is located.

<P> Wankel left school at the age of 19, but he gained academic
recognition within his own time when he was awarded an honorary
doctorate degree from Technische Universit&auml;t M&uuml;nchen in 1969.
His first job was apprenticing in sales for a publisher in Heidelberg,
but he devoted his energy to tinkering, especially after losing the
sales job in 1924.

<P> Wankel's first attempt to receive a patent was in 1926 for a "grease
turbine", but it was predated by an Enke design from 1886.  In 1933 he
applied for a patent for a <A HREF="rce.html#DKM">DKM</A> engine, which
he received in 1936.

<P> In the following years, Wankel mostly made his way by ingenious work
on rotary valves and sealing technology for BMW, DVL, Junker, and
Daimler-Benz.  During this time he developed various DKM prototypes and
also rotary pumps and compressors.

<P> After the end of the war in 1945 his development was interrupted,
but by 1951 he interested NSU in development.  This lead to
collaboration with Walter Froede, head of the motorcycle racing program,
who would ultimately make the decision to adopt the <A
HREF="rce.html#KKM">KKM</A> type.

<P> The first truly functional Wankel rotary engine was a DKM type that
ran in February 1957.  By May a prototype was able to run for two hours
and produce 21 bhp.  The first KKM engine ran on July 7, 1958.

<P> There are Felix-Wankel-Strasse streets in Heilbronn, Dachau, and
Neckarsulm, all in Germany.

<P> Dr. Wankel had a strong impulse towards animal welfare.  <A HREF =

<H1> RCE Theory and Design </H1>

<H2> The RCE Rotor Moves Inside an Epitrochoid Curve </H2>

<P> A Rotary Combustion Engine (RCE) as invented by <A HREF =
"dr-wankel.html">Felix Wankel</A> and developed by Walter Froede differs
from a <A HREF = "glossary.html#piston-engine">Piston Engine</A> in four
primary ways:

<UL>

<LI> The RCE Rotor supercedes the piston engine's piston.

<LI> The RCE Eccentric Shaft [<A HREF =
"glossary.html#eccentric">gloss</A>] supercedes the piston engine's
crankshaft and connecting rods.

<LI> The RCE Peripheral Housing [<A HREF =
"glossary.html#peripheral">gloss</A>] supercedes the piston engine's
cylinder.

<LI> Intake and exhaust ports [<A HREF = "glossary.html#port">gloss</A>]
in the housings eliminate valves, camshafts, and timing belts.

</UL>

<P> The Housing shape is an epitrochoid [<A
HREF="glossary.html#epitrochoid">gloss</A>] curve (more properly,
peritrochoid) [<A HREF="glossary.html#peritrochoid">gloss</A>].  It is
generated by rolling a circle around another circle.  The rolling circle
is half the size of the generating circle.  Drexel provides an extended
discussion of the <A HREF =
"http://wwwtdec.coe.drexel.edu/TDEC/MFE/comp_alg/eewm/exploration15/exp15-deriv.html">mathematics</A>
of the epitrochoid curve and the rotor shape.

<P> <STRONG> Java Demonstration of <A HREF="j-epi.html">Generating an
Epitrochoid</A> (about 44 KB) </STRONG>

<H2> The Wankel RC Engine is an Otto Cycle Engine (Four "Stroke") </H2>

<P> <STRONG> Java Demonstration of <A HREF="j-wankel.html">RC Engine
Cycles</A> (about 104 KB) </STRONG>

<H2> There are two main types of RCE </H2>

<UL>

<LI> <A NAME="KKM"> <B> KKM </B> </A> <EM> Kreiskolbenmotor </EM> or
planetary rotation motor (PLM), distinguished by one stationary
peripheral housing.  The rotor moves in an orbit and propels an
eccentric shaft.  This is easier to manufacture, cool, and maintain than
DKM.  Intake and exhaust passages are better.  Better cooling is
achievable.  It is more compact.  Modern rotaries are KKM types.

<LI> <A NAME="DKM"> <B> DKM </B> </A> <EM> Drehkolben Maschine </EM> or
single-rotation engine (SIM), the first RCE, has the distinctive feature
of an inner rotating housing and rotor moving in circular motion around
a fixed central shaft.  This requires disassembling the motor to change
spark plugs, perhaps the main reason it was discarded.  However, DKM is
the smoothest of the two, and high rates beyond 25,000 rpm are possible.
Bearing loads are lighter.

</UL>

<P> The rotary combustion engine must not be confused with "rotary"
aircraft engines which are piston cylinders arranged in a circle.  The
whole engine rotates.

<H2> Advantages </H2>

<UL>

<LI> Light weight and compact.

<LI> Smooth:  no reciprocating motion.

<LI> Extended power "stroke" rotation of the output shaft: 270 degrees
vs. the 180 degrees of a piston.

<LI> Fewer moving parts: no valves, connecting rods, cams, timing
chains.  Intake and exhaust timing are accomplished directly by the
motion of the rotor.

<LI> Flat torque curve because no valves are used.

<LI> Cooler combustion means fewer oxides of nitrogen.  Catalytic
converters lessen this advantage.

<LI> Separation of combustion region from intake region is good for
<A HREF="hydrogen.html">hydrogen</A> fuel.

</UL>

<H2> Disadvantages </H2>

<UL>

<LI> High surface to volume ratio in combustion chamber is less 
thermodynamically efficient.  The Wankel's long and narrow chamber
makes for long flame travel, but this is countered by the Mazda's
two spark plugs (three on some racing engines).

<LI> Higher fuel consumption.  Thus <A HREF="mazda.html">Mazda</A> has
been successful with the <A HREF="rx-7.html">RX-7 sports car</A>, a market
where fuel consumption is less of an issue.  Only 16 years after the
first engine ran, the 1973 oil crisis devastated the RCE before it had
sufficiently developed to become more economical.

</UL>

<H2> History of Rotary Machines </H2>

<P> Designs for rotary engines were proposed as early as 1588 by
Ramelli, though it took the development of the Otto cycle engine in 1876
and the advent of the automobile in 1896 to set the stage for a proper
rotary combustion engine.

<P> Other early designs were made by Huygens in 1673 and Kepler.  James
Watt made a rotary piston steam engine in 1759.

<HR>

<P> Wankel engines use cycloidal gearing, an old and unusual form of
gearing used in watches, Roots blowers, screw compressors, and pumps.

<P> Power figures are SAE net unless noted SAE gross, DIN, or JIS.
Early (1960 and before) German horsepower figures are almost certainly
gross even if not marked as such.  American horsepower appears to have
gone to net about 1970. Multiplying JIS by .80 or .85 gives SAE net.

<P> Engine capacities are quoted as single chamber capacity.  Various

<H1> The Rotary Engined Chevrolet Corvettes </H1>

<P> In 1970, Chevrolet obtained a licence for the <A HREF =
"dr-wankel.html">Wankel</A> <A HREF = "rce.html">RCE</A> from <A HREF =
"nsu.html">NSU</A> and began building a two-rotor and a four-rotor
Corvette [1, 2].  A fibreglass model is approved in June 1971 by GM
Pres. Ed Cole [4].

<P> On Jan. 14, 1972, a chassis was shipped to Pininfarina, Turin, Italy
so that the body could be constructed by the famed design studio [4].
In June of the same year, a 2 rotor Corvette with a steel body was
viewed by GM management [4, 5].  The same year GM commissioned a
two-rotor version of the XP-882 and built it as the XP-987GT [2].

<P> In January 1973, a Corvette body was built for an experiment
four-rotor car [4].  By April, the GALCIT wind tunnel in California was
used to test the aerodynamic qualities of the 4-rotor Corvette [4].  In
September 13, 1973 a 266 ci two-rotor Corvette was shown in Frankfurt,
Germany [1, 3].  The four-rotor 390 ci Corvette was shown at Paris,
France on Oct. 4, 1973, as well as the two-rotor [1].

<P> On September 24, 1974, GM Pres. Ed Cole postponed the introduction
of the Wankel engine, ostensibly due to emissions difficulties [6].  He
retired the same month.

<P> The 74 Chevy Vega was originally planned for a rotary engine.  This
was delayed to 1975, but this was dropped in 1974.  The engine was a two
rotor water cooled with oil cooling of the rotors.  There was a single

<H2> <A NAME = "Matsuda"> Jujiro Matsuda (1875 - 1952) </H2>

<P> Matsuda was born August 6, 1875, 12th son of a fisherman in the
Hiroshima Prefecture.  His father died when he was three years old.  At
the age of 13 he got a job in a blacksmith shop in Osaka.  At the age of
20, in 1894 he started his own shop and employed 50 workers, but a
recession drove him out of business.  He tried again eleven years later
in converted cow shed.  His eldest son, Tsuneji (1897?-1971), pumped air
for the furnace.

<P> Jujiro Matsuda invented and patented a pump. It sold well, so he
formed the Matsuda Pump Partnership.  He was edged out a few years later
when the company was taken over.

<P> In 1912 Jujiro formed Matsuda Works.  In one year it employed 4000
workers to produce four million artillery fuses for the Russian Czar's
government.  Then it became Japan Armament Manufacturing Company.
Later he left to create a new Matsuda Works in Hiroshima.  Nihon Steel
Manufacuring Co. took this over.

<H2> <A NAME = "Toyo"> Toyo Kogyo 1920, 1927 </H2>

<P> A group of investors including Matsuda took over a failing Abemaki
tree cork company in January 1920, naming it Toyo Cork Kogyo Company
Limited.  Toyo means Orient and Kogyo means industry. Jujiro became
president the next year.

<P> In September 1927, Matsuda reformed the company as Toyo Kogyo Kaisha
(Company) Limited to grow out of Cork and into industrial production.  A
test run of 30 motorcycles were manufactured in 1930 or earlier, since
one of them won a race that year.

<H2> <A NAME = "MazdaDA"> Mazda Type DA Motorized Tricycle Truck 1931 </H2>

<P> Ahura Mazda is the Zoroastran lord of light, creator of the
universe.  The name is also very close to Matsuda.  Toyo Kogyo
successfully produced these 500cc three wheelers with differential
transmissions beginning in 1931.  A small passenger sedan protoype was
made in 1940, but this had to be abandoned.

<H2> <A NAME = "recovery"> Recovery after Atom Bomb </H2>

<P> The atom bomb was dropped on August 6, 1945, but the company was
fortunate that less than half of the plant was destroyed.  In 1950 Toyo
Kogyo produced the Type CT three-wheeler with 1157 cc V twin (32 bhp).
This was very successful.  In May 1960 the R360 air cooled coupe was
introduced with a 356 cc two cylinder rear mounted engine.  In 1962
there was the 358 cc four cylinder Carol sedan.  1963 saw the model
800 and Familia four with front engines and rear drive.

<P> Jujiro's son Tenuji became President of the Company in 1951. Jujiro
passed away in March 1952.  Tsuneji succumbed to a lung inflammation in
1971.  His son Kohei succeeded him until he stepped down in 1977.

<P> In 1984 the company name was changed to Mazda Motor
Corporation. Mazda has assembly plants in 21 countries and exports to
120 countries.

<H2> <A NAME = "RCE-events"> RCE Events at Mazda </H2>

<P> In 1973, Mazda sold 104,960 cars in the US, twice the previous
year's total.  More than 92 percent had rotary engines.  The next year,
after the gas crisis had made its impact felt, Mazda sold only 61,192
cars in the US.

<H1> Glossary of Terms </H1>

<DL>

<DT> <A NAME="apex"> Apex <DD> One of the three tips of the rotor.

<DT> <A NAME="bridgeport"> Bridge Port <DD> A radical alteration to
the intake ports of an RCE, extending them, but maintaining a bridge
of metal to retain rotor seals as they pass by.

<DT> <A NAME="eccentric"> Eccentric Shaft <DD> The shaft that the rotors
move around.  It has sections that are offset from the center.
Supercedes the piston engine's crankshaft.

<DT> <A NAME="epitrochoid"> Epitrochoid <DD> The curve that defines the
inner surface of the peripheral housing.  Generated by rolling a circle
around another circle (<A HREF = "j-epi.html">demonstrated in 44 KB of
Java</A>).  Perhaps should more correctly called peritrochoid.

<DT> <A NAME="housing"> Housing <DD> Supercedes piston cylinder walls
and head.  Two kinds: peripheral and side.  The latter has three
sub-types: front, central, and side (depending on the number of rotors).

<DT> <A NAME="peripheral-housing"> Peripheral Housing <DD> The metal
housing that contains the rotation of the rotor.  The shape is an
epitrochoidal curve.  It supercedes the piston engine's cylinders.

<DT> <A NAME="peritrochoid"> Peritrochoid <DD> Perhaps this is the
more correct name for epitrochoid.

<DT> <A NAME="piston-engine"> Piston Engine <DD> Plebian combustion
engine characterized by masses of metal being jerked backwards and
forwards.  Had 100 year headstart over RCE.

<DT> <A NAME="port"> Port <DD> An opening in the peripheral or side
housing to admit the air-fuel mixture or release the combustion
products.

<DT> <A NAME="porting"> Porting <DD> Modifying the intake ports
by cutting away metal.

<DT> <A NAME="RCE"> RCE <DD> Rotary Combustion Engine.  Not to be
confused with Restricted Coulomb Energy neural networks.

<DT> <A NAME="seals"> Seals <DD> Metal seals for the rotor tips and
sides supercede piston rings.  Rubber seals to mate the peripheral and
side housings.

<DT> <A NAME="side-housing"> Side Housing <DD> Fixed plate against which
a rotor slides.  Three sub-types: front, central, and side (depending on
the number of rotors).

<DT> <A NAME="tribology"> Tribology <DD> The study of friction.  From
French from Greek <EM>tribein</EM> to rub.

<DT> <A NAME="wankel"> Wankel <DD> <A HREF = "dr-wankel.html">Felix
Wankel</A>, inventor of the RCE.  Sometimes loosely used as a term for
an RCE.  As a point of trivia, this is also a Dutch and Afrikaans word
meaning "shaky, unstable, fickle" with senses of "stagger, reel".  In
that sense, one could make the observation that the rotor falls around
the stationary gear when being driven by the combustion.

<H1> Hydrogen Powered Rotaries </H1>

<H2> Mazda Weighs Plans </H2>

<BLOCKQUOTE> Mazda is weighing plans to market a hydrogen fueled auto
said to outperform electric vehicles. One of the biggest remaining
questions is when to start. Mazda says timing of the launch hinges on a
government program to develop a hydrogen fuel distribution
network. Japan's MITI reportedly aims to have infrastructure in place to
support widespread use of hydrogen as a transport fuel by 2010. Mazda
claims its hydrogen vehicle - based on a Wankel rotary engine - has a
range of 230 km and a top speed of 150 km/hr. By comparison, the
automaker says, electric vehicles typically can travel no more than 180
km without recharging and achieve top speeds of 130 km/hr, while
gasoline fueled cars have ranges as high as 590 km and top speeds of 183
km/hr. </BLOCKQUOTE>

Mazda has begun a two year trial period for its experimental
low-pollution hydrogen rotary engine (RE) vehicle.  The Cappella Cargo
van model vehicle will burn a hydrogen fuel that when burned will not
emit carbon dioxide.  <A HREF = "mazda.html">Mazda</A> will lend the
vehicle to the Hirohata Steel Mill for use as their company van and

<H2> Fuel of the Future </H2>

<PRE>
To: [rx7@world.std.com]
Date: Sat, 12 Nov 1994 11:19:08 -0800
From: monito@ (<A HREF="../index.html">Alan Marr</A>)
Subject: Hydrogen Rotaries: the facts
</PRE>

<P> Mazda Hydrogen fueled cars have all been rotaries:

<PRE>
HR-X1  not hydride, 2 seat, spacy commuter look.
HR-X2  metal hydride, 4 seat, dowdy.
MX-5   metal hydride, Miata body, front twin rotor, rear drive.
</PRE>

<P> Hydrogen has a low ignition temperature so the standard four stroke
engine is prone to pre-detonation and backfiring through the intake
ports.  The <A HREF="rce.html">rotary engine</A> separates the intake
ports from the combustion area so there are no hot spots in the intake
phase.

<P> The hydrogen Miata is 400 kg (880 lb) heavier than the standard car.
This is partly because a 300 kg (660 lb) H2 fuel tank replaces the
standard 50 kg (110 lb) for a full gasoline tank.
Thus it is encouraging that it performs as well as it does.
Intriguingly, the prototype has a left side driver (US).  Mazda also
has an electric prototype using fuel cells, also with a 400 kg
increase in weight.  MX-5 is the international designation of Miata.

<PRE>
			Gasoline	Hydrogen	Electric
Power (HP)              120             110
Top Speed kmh (mph)	183 (114)	150 (93)	130 (81)
0-40 kmh (25 mph) sec	  2.5		  2.9		  4.2
0-100 kh (62 mph) sec	  9.4		 13.0		 21.5
Refueling time            3 minute?      15 minute       hours?
</PRE>

<P> The view from the driver's seat:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
    Inside the hydrogen car, everything is standard apart from a small
    pressure instrument - the fuel gauge...  Starting the hydrogen car
    is no different from starting the petrol model, and engine noise
    sounds familiar too.
</BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE>
    ... the intake system combines a pre-mix air/fuel system for light
    load driving...  There is also a direct-injection system through a
    dedicated hydrogen port which opens when the air intake port is
    closed.  This is effective in increasing available power for
    higher speed driving...
</BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE>
    When the fuel pressure gets low, the power drops noticeably and
    the car slows dramatically.  Changing down the gears makes little
    or no appreciable difference and even with 20 percent pressure
    available, the car is effectively unable to carry on.  Refuelling
    these prototypes takes about 15 minutes from start to finish.
</BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE>
    The electric car is completely different...  There is very little
    engine braking so you have to start using the brakes much earlier
    than normal.  And the engine is virtually silent, which make tire
    and wind noise much more apparent.
</BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE>
    Battery technology is holding up the whole electric car movement:
    development has failed to produce a satisfactory alternative to
    nickel cadmium batteries (like those in the Mazda) or the standard
    lead acid type which cause so many of the problems.  They make
    electric cars heavy, expensive, and poor performers, with very few
    miles possible between each lengthy charge-up.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P> Mazda is investing much more heavily in hydrogen research than
electricity.  Seiji Tanaka, head of Mazda R&#38;D, says

<BLOCKQUOTE>
    Our first objective is to use available fuels more efficiently by
    producing better engines.  At present we are researching the
    Miller cycle and developing lean-burn technology.  Our second
    objective is to investigate alternative fuels such as natural gas
    and methanol and electric cars.  But this will not cut pollution.
    Hydrogen offers many advantages over all these, especially
    electric cars, and with the rotary fuelled by hydrogen,
    performance is very close to the petrol engine.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P> Japan's MITI is sponsoring the New Sunshine Project.  The goal is to
use hydrogen power "to replace 3 percent of electrical power, 10
percent of city gas use and 5 percent of transportation energy supply
by 2010".

<P> Mazda is trying to convince the California Air Resources Board to
admit the hydrogen rotary as a Zero Emission vehicle.  The issue is
the tiny amounts of hydrocarbon output because of the engine
lubricant.

<P> Hydrogen faces infrastructure hurdles and public concern over safety.
Metal hydrides are a safe mobile storage method.  Hydrogen is in some
ways safer than gasoline since the vapour rises into the atmosphere
and doesn't collect on the ground.

<H2> <A NAME="HRX-2"> HRX-2 at 30th Tokyo Motor Show </H2>

<P> Mazda's HRX-2 "is powered by a hydrogen burning rotary engine and
has a virutally 100% recyclable body structure.  It's been developed
with the potential to use liquid-crystal polymer fibre-reinforced
plastic.  This plastic is in the process of further research for
practical use.  The plastic-made upper-body can be easily detached from
the metal chassis.  The electrical and control systems are integrated
into one area.  Therefore, this structure makes it easier to disassemble
the body and to sort, by material make-up.  The HRX-2 is an updated
version of the HR-X which was exhibited at the 29th Tokyo Motor Show.
it has improvements in driving performance and cruising range."

<HR>

<P> Mazda Motor Corp is already bench-testing a Miata equipped with a
hydrogen-powered rotary engine as part of its bid to be the first
automobile manufacturer to market a hydrogen-powered vehicle.  Mazda
expects the vehicle to have a one-tank range of 248 miles, which is
twice as long as that of the HR-X concept car shown at the 1991 Tokyo
Motor Show.  The hydrogen-powered rotary engine is also being tested in
Mazda's Capella Cargo wagon.

<H2> Mazda Advances Environmentally-Correct HR-X:  Powered by Hydrogen </H2>

<P> The refined Mazda HR-X shown above is a concept car that runs on
pure, renewable hydrogen, and emits primarily only water vapor.  It has
been improved since its original debut in 1991 by Mazda engineers to
improve its performance and increase its fuel efficiency. The Mazda
vehicle shows that hydrogen can be safely used as a fuel.

<P> The metal hydride tank is shown being fueled below, with one
hydrogen fuel line, and two lines which run cooling water through the
tank.  During refueling, the metal hydride in the tank warms as it
absorbs hydrogen, and the water cools it to allow more to be
absorbed. When the engine is running, the warm engine coolant water is
circulated through the tank to warm the metal hydride, causing the
hydrogen fuel to be released.

<P> Unlike piston-engines, the rotary engine has separate intake and
combustion chambers.  This allows the rotary engine to avoid the
backfiring and preignition problems that other engines have experienced.
The rotor draws the air and hydrogen in as it passes the top of the
cycle, then moves the mixture to the lower right and compresses it,
where it is ignited to drive the engine.

<P> The HR-X hydrogen car's rotary engine delivers 100 horsepower, which
is nearly the same as the <A HREF = "rx-7.html">original RX-7</A>.  This
concept car, shown at the Tokyo Motor Show, and auto shows in New York
and Los Angeles, has generated much excitement and public awareness of
hydrogen as a fuel with today's technology.  Mazda's break ahead of the
other auto companies is truly an advancement to the solar hydrogen
industry.

<H2> Remarks at Solar Hydrogen Industrial Workshop at UCLA, Ca, Feb. 8,
1993 </H2>

<P> Vahe Kluejian, Manager of Research, Mazda Motor Company:

<P> Mazda developed the hydrogen fueled rotary engine as an option to
meet new emission standards.  The rotary engine is more difficult to
reduce emissions in, except with hydrogen.  With the oncoming ZEV,
hydrogen is the future fuel.  Mazda plans to use metal hydrides or any
nonliquid for safety.  Their main problem has been convincing regulators
that hydrogen is viable.  Mazda has built three test vehicles, and more
are being built for real-world standards for fleet testing and
demonstration.  Mazda's hydrogen car can be made commercial in 1998-2000
per the ZEV specification.

<H2> <A NAME = "SeriesI"> <A NAME = "1stgen"> First Generation 1979-1985 </H2>

<P> <A HREF = "mazda.html">Mazda</A> formally started the project in
1976 when it was called X605.  The first prototype was completed in
1977.  It was introduced to America as a 79 model on April 24, 1978
since production began in March (<A HREF =
"http://aruba.ccit.arizona.edu/~rockd/brochure.html">brochure</A> (heavy
graphics)).  A slogan Mazda used was "It's the real thing. A sports car
with all the traditional virtues and then some."  One magazine's
headline was "The Rotary Revolution has begun".  Thus began Mazda's
passion for pure sport cars that has continued through three generations
and includes the Miata and <A HREF = "rx-01.html">RX-01</A>.

<P> The 12A engine (2 x 573 = 1146 cc) had two side intake ports and one
peripheral exhaust port per rotor.  There was a thermal reactor.
Transmissions were four and five speed manual and three speed auto.

<P> American models were two seaters only, though a 2+2 was offered in
Japan due to relaxed crash standards.

<P> A good <A HREF =

<P> The P designates "production". Upgraded interior materials.
Production changed October, 1979.

<H3> P815 </H3>

<P> It appeared in August 1980.  The rear and tail lights were redesigned
eliminating the "Baroque depression".  Front bumper, air dam changed.
The Japanese variant had rotor inspired aluminum wheels.

<H3> GSL Model </H3>

<P> This began in 1980 (part of P815 run) as the "Leather Sport", 2500
units, and became the GSL in 1981.

<H3> <A NAME = "SeriesII"> Series II </H3>

<P> In 1981 they were restyled, most visibly in the rear.

<H3> P130 </H3>

<P> An stop-gap version appeared in July 1982, the P130, with an improved
engine for better fuel economy.  A high output audio system was an option.
It was called "Black Dynamite".

<H3> <A NAME = "SeriesIII"> P132 or <A NAME = "gslse"> GSL-SE Model 84-85 </H3>

The SE saw the re-introduction of the 13B engine, last seen in the 1978
RX-4, but now rated at 135 bhp because of Dynamic Effect Intake (DEI),
six port induction (2 by 3), and electronic fuel injection.  In Japan,
there was a P132 with a 12A turbocharged engine.  Power steering was
offered for the first time.  The interior was upgraded, but this did
not appear in the Japanese turbo version.

<H2> <A NAME = "2ndgen"> Second Generation 1986-1991 </H2>

<H3> <A NAME = "SeriesIV"> First Half 86-88 </H3>

<P> The 13B engine was the only size offered.  Power was increased to
146 bhp.  The Turbo II engine had 182 bhp.

<P> These are distinguishable by a return to round tail lights.  Under
the hood, horsepower was increased by 10 %.

<H2> <A NAME = "3rdgen"> Third Generation 1993 to Present </H2>

<P> The RX-7 was <EM>Motor Trend's</EM> Import Car of the Year.  The
engine comes in one version only, sequential twin turbo.

<P> The 93 RX-7 easily sustained 112-135 mph on the German Autobahn for
over 200 miles, getting 11.6 mpg.  When speed was lowered below 113 mph,
economy was raised to 14 mpg.

<P> Citro&#235;n's first brush with the RCE was a variant idea of de
Lavaud.  <A HREF = "nsu.html">NSU</A> and Citro&#235;n formed a company
called Comobil in 1964 or 65.  In 1967 they set up Comotor S.A. in
Luxembourg.  In 1970 some Citro&#235;n M35s were made which used an NSU
KKM 500 engine in modified Ami 8s.  They have hydraulic suspension like
the GS and 49 hp for a top speed of 144 kmh (89 mph) (compare this with
the Ami 8's 123 kmh or the 1973 Ami Super's 140 kmh).  212 were made in
1970 and 49 in 1971.

<P> GS Birotor: Citro&#235;n GS Birotor with a KKM 622 (107 bhp).  This
was first shown at the 1973 Frankfurt automobile show.  I think this may
have had the Berline body style.  They had a top speed of 175 kmh from
107 DIN hp (vs. 151 kmh, 60 hp for GS).  834 were built in 1974, 31 in
1975.  A Van Veen OCR 1000 used a 100 bhp Comotor engine, probably the
KKM 622, in 1974.  It had a top speed of 150 mph.

I mentioned this book in passing a few weeks ago but I'll post the info
once again for all those that missed it.  It's a wonderful book with all
sorts of interesting data and tons of great pictures.  If you want to
learn more about your car and about the <A HREF="rx-7.html">RX-7
family</A> and how exactly the rotary engine came about, you might want
to grab this book.  It's interesting how the [first] Wankel engine was
designed to run smoothly at 25,000 rpm's but wasn't practical because
the engine had to be disassembled to <A HREF="rce.html#DKM">change the
spark plugs</A>.  Anyway, The book covers everything from July 1, 1958
when the first rotary engine ran [KKM], to the <A
HREF="corvette.html">GM rotary</A>, all the way thru to the <A
HREF="rx-7.html#3rdgen">1994 RX-7</A> R2.

<P> The Mazda 787B won overall the 59th 24 Hours of Le Mans (24 Heures
de Le Mans) on June 22-23, 1991, at the Sarthe circuit, Le Mans, France.
<A HREF="mazda.html">Mazda</A> was the first Japanese winner of the
race, and the only winner with a rotary engine.  The winners (Johnny
Herbert, Bertrand Gachot, and Volker Weidler) drove 362 laps and 4923.2
km (3059.1 miles), 27.2 km ahead of the second place car.  The average
speed was 205.3 kph.  They lead from lap 320 to the end (the last three
hours).

<P> In 1990, FISA decided that starting in 1992 no RCE engines would be
allowed.

<P> The R 26B engine that won was normally aspirated and had four rotors
and three sequential spark plugs per rotor.  It produced 700 bhp at 9000
rpm and 62 mkg torque at 6500 rpm (448 lb-ft).  Fuel was electronically
injected and consumption was 51.881 liters per 100 km at an average
speed of 213.58 kph (excluding pit stops).  The air intakes had
continuously variable geometry controlled by the engine electronics.
The transmission had 5 speeds (full synchromesh) from a Porsche design
gearbox and a limited slip differential.

The Mazda 787B car weighed 830 kg (1831 lb).  The chassis was designed
by Nigel Stroud and the body was carbon fibre.  Wheelbase was 2.66 m by
1.53/1.50 m and overall size 4.78 by 1.99 m.  It had 18 in wheels,
ventilated carbon fibre brakes.  Tires were Dunlop 300-640x18 front and
355-710x18 rear.

<IMG SRC="../Images/c111-ykho-h100.jpg" WIDTH=137 HEIGHT=100
	ALIGN=MIDDLE> C111.

<P> Daimler-Benz made several <A HREF = "rce.html">Rotary Combustion
Engine</A> (RCE) <A HREF = "engines.html#Daimler-Benz">prototypes</A> from
1962 into the early 70s.  Some were developed for small sedans, but the
one of most spectacular vehicles ever to flaunt a rotary was the
two-seat C111, complete with gull-wing doors.  The engine was placed
mid-ship.  Sixteen prototypes were built.

<P> The C111 had three- and four-rotor engines, first shown in 1969 and
1970, respectively.  The three-rotor could generate 280 bhp and move the
car 0 to 60 in 4.9 seconds.  The latter developed as much as 400
horsepower, though it was usually tuned for the street at 305
horsepower.  There were interesting innovations such as a variable
length intake and an anti-lock braking system (ABS).  The car was a
heavy 2900 pounds, but was capable of 185 mph and 0-60 mph in less than
5 seconds.

<P> The project was headed by Dr Hans Liebold.  It ultimately fell
victim to the oil crisis and a timid board with a "not-invented-here"
attitude.  This was a shame because the cars were unfailingly reliable.

<P> As of 1990, Daimler-Benz was the main supporter of TES, <A

<P> The Norton Manufacturing Company was created in 1898 by James
Landsdowne Norton.  Motorcycles were built as early as 1907 and winning
races.  By 1913 it had become Norton Motors Ltd and was making
motorcycles in Birmingham, England.

<P> Norton's involvement with <A HREF = "rce.html">rotary combustion
engines</A> began with the amalgamation of Norton-Villiers and
BSA-Triumph to form Norton-Villiers-Triumph (NVT) in 1973.  The
Birmingham Small Arms Co., Ltd., (BSA) had obtained an <A HREF =
"nsu.html">NSU</A> license in July 1972 a Wankel project codenamed P41.
They had built a <A HREF = "engines.html#FichtelSachs">Fichtels &#38;
Sachs</A> motor into a Victor frame for testing.

<P> In 1974 through 1976 financial troubles almost scuttled NVT.  The
P41 project was then located at the Shenstone, Lichfield, Staffordshire
facilities.  Around 1977 work was moved to Birmingham to an experimental
laboratory.

<H2> <A NAME="InterpolII"> Norton Interpol II Motorcycle </H2>

<P> Norton Motors (1978) Ltd was formed in 1978 as a motorcycle division.  A
number of RCE prototypes had been shown to the press and received
favourably.  25 Mark I prototypes were built in 1979.  In 1981 a Mark II
appeared, which eventually went into production as the Interpol II.  130
machines were purchased by police forces in 1983.  Additional units were
bought by the British armed forces and the Royal Automobile Club.

<H2> Norton F1 Race Motorcycle </H2>

<P> Trevor Nation had great success racing Norton rotaries beginning in
1988.  In 1990 he won the MCN TT Superbike championship.

<P> Steve Spray first raced a Norton rotary in Oct. 1988.  He won the
Formula One race at Brands Hatch on a Saturday and the Powerbike
International on the Sunday.  This was after riding it for the very
first time on the Friday.  He also won the 1988 ACU 1300cc championship.

<P> The F1R was to be produced for race privateers.  Initially 12 were
to be produced.  Specs included racing callipers and discs, six gears,
and magnesium alloy wheels. Price complete only &#163;27,000.

<H2> <A NAME="record"> British Motorcycle Land Speed Record </H2>

<P> The record had been set in 1978 at 191 mph by Roy Daniels riding a
Triumph with two engines and supercharging.

<P> In the autumn of 1990 an F1 race engine was installed in Alex
Macfadzean's Penetrator streamlined motorcycle.  Mike Booys rode it to
191.89 mph for a new 750cc record.  Unofficial runs were at 200 mph.

<H2> <A NAME="drone"> Norton Aircraft and Target Drone Engines </H2>

<P> NR642: 90 bhp from 60 kg total weight with integrated reduction
gearbox.  Twin rotor by 294 cc gives 588 cc.  At cruise, Specific fuel
consumption (SFC) of 0.51 lb / bhp per hour.  Uses leaded or unleaded,
Avgas or Mogas fuels.  In field trials, 1989, when it was chosen by the
joint McDonnell Douglas / Development Sciences Corporation team as the
best engine for short range Remote Piloted Vehicles (RPV).  This engine
was approved by the CAA for civilian passenger aircraft in December
1990.  During testing, the engine is run for 150 hours at 8000 rpm,
disassembled, reassembled and run again for 150 hours.  This is like
driving at a constant speed of 120 miles per hour for 35,000 miles with
only one stop.

<P> In 1990 Norton contracted Rogers Aviation in Cranfield, England, to
install a Cessna 152 with an NR642 for testing.  One was powering a
Seabird Sentinel pusher prop light aircraft in 1989.  Two were in an
Ivan Shaw TwinEze, cruising speed 175 knots, two pusher props of 53 in
diameter.  Ivan Shaw was GM of Aviation Composites Ltd, a former branch
of the Lotus car company.

<P> NR622: similar to NR642, but has a lower prop line and a lighter
gearbox.  82 bhp.  The latest model is the P62 which increases its
output to 90 bhp by using an exhaust ejector system of rotor cooling.

<P> NR731: 38 bhp from 10 kg (23 lb) constant speed engine.  Low
Specific fuel consumption: 0.52 lb/bhp per hour at cruise.  Air cooled.
In production, 1989.  Formerly P73.  Was fitted into Banshee 300 RPV
military target drone.

<P> NR801: Ultra light and compact liquid cooled RPV engine.  294cc by
one rotor.  40 bhp at 6000 rpm or 50 bhp at 75000 rpm, 23 kg including
integrated 1.5 kw alternator.  Was in pre-production in 1989.

<H2> Norton Hovercraft. </H2>

<P> Bill Yates put a P60 engine for thrust and an NR731 for list into a
homebuilt one man hovercraft.  The vehicle finished second in the
British National Formula One championship, winning two more races than
the champion.

<H2> Norton's Demise </H2>

<P> In 1987 a group of investors headed by Philippe Le Roux took over,
forming Norton Group PLC, mainly for the value of its properties.  When
these turned out to be less than anticipated it was realized that the
Norton name was irrevocably tied to motorcycles.  Thus RCE motorcycle
production was funded.

<P> <A NAME="Roton"> In October 1989 Brian Crighton left Norton to form
the Roton Company which planned to produce motorcycles in Australia.
They won 6th and 7th in their first race in March 1991 at Caldwell Park.
Grant Hodson rode the Roton to win the Australian F1 Championship two
part race at Oron Park that year.  Steve Spray was also riding.

<P> In 1990 Le Roux said "The Norton F1 is the Porsche of the motorcycle
world.  It is a superb example of British innovation and technology and
will take the Norton name into the 1990s as one of the most prestigious
names in motorcycling."  Combining this with the engine business and the
Commando spare parts business, prospects appeared to be looking up.
Then Le Roux departed as chief executive officer in 1991.

<P> A Department of Trade and Industry investigation was launched in
1991 to look into the activities of all the members of the Norton group,
including Pro-fit (American pipe), Minty (furniture), and FUS (German
fastenings).  The outcome is not known to this writer.  A motorcycle
magazine claimed that Norton was looted financially in the early 90s.

<P> Production Cars (Group N), Touring Cars (Group A) and Grand Touring
Cars (Group B) may run rotary engines.  <A HREF =
"http://www2.fia.com/fia/regle/reg_tec/252-a.htm">Article 252</A> states
"The equivalent cubic capacity is 1.5 times the volume determined by the
difference between the maximum and minimum capacities of the combustion
chamber."

<H2> Rally Racing </H2>

<P> Malcolm Smith and Jack Sreenan won Mazda's first pro rally in 1975
at the SCCA Mojave 24 Hour Rally.  The vehicle was the Rotary Pickup
truck sponsored by Alaskan Brand.

<H2> Midget Racing </H2>

<P> Drew Fornoro drove Gene Angelillo's upright midget powered by a 13B
to the North East Midget Racing Association (NEMA) championship in 1985.
Racing officials decided to handicap the rotary engine and restricted it
to a 12A.  They won again in 1986 in a lay-down midget.  The association
decided to bar rotary combustion engines from competition, claiming they
had no way to measure it.

<H1>Der NSU Spider, das erste Serienauto der Welt mit dem NSU
Wankel-Kreiskolbenmotor</H1>

<P> Die Idee eines Motors ohne oszillierende Bewegungen um eine
komplizierte Kurbelwelle und die notwendige Steuerung von Ein- und
Ausla&szlig;ventilen wurde in den 50er Jahren in einer Zusammenarbeit
von dem Erfinder <A HREF = "dr-wankel.html">Felix Wankel</A> und den <B>
NSU Motorenwerken </B> verwirklicht.  Nach vielen Spekulationen und
gezielt gestreuten Indiskretionen &uuml;ber den neuen <A HREF =
"rce.html#KKM">Motor</A> mu&szlig;te man im Januar 1960 auf einer
eigens einberufenen VDI-Tagung im Deutschen Museum an die
&Ouml;ffentlichkeit gehen. Auf einer improvisierten B&uuml;hne wurde auf
einer LKW- Pritsche der erste Kreiskolbenmotor der &Ouml;ffentlichkeit
vorgef&uuml;hrt.  Zahlreiche B&ouml;rsenspekulationen um die
M&ouml;glichkeiten des neuen &quot;Wundermotors&quot; und
Abschl&uuml;sse mit Lizenznehmern in aller Welt zwangen<B> NSU</B>
kurzfristig ein serienm&auml;&szlig;iges Fahrzeug mit dem neuen Motor
vorzustellen und dessen Gebrauchst&uuml;chtigkeit unter Beweis zu
stellen.

<P> Auf der IAA 1963 wurde nach langem Z&ouml;gern des erste Serienauto
mit Wankel-Kreiskolbenmotor vorgestellt. Es handelte sich um ein kleines
Cabrio, dessen Verwandtschaft zu dem seit 1959 produziertem Sport-Prinz,
einem Prinzen mit 600 ccm Viertakt-Twin-Motor und 30 PS mit
Coup&eacute;-Karosserie vom italienischen Designer Nuccio Bertone nicht
zu &uuml;bersehen war.

<P> Doch es sollte noch fast ein Jahr dauern bis die Serienfertigung des
NSU Wankel-Spiders anlief. Zahlreiche Detailprobleme an dem neuen
Motorkonzept erforderten intensive Nachbesserungen, bevor das kleine
Auto mit nur 500 ccm Kammervolumen, aber einer Leistung von 50 PS den
ersten Kunden &uuml;berlassen werden konnte. Etliche von ihnen waren als
enthusiastische Tester f&uuml;r das Betriebsverhalten des neuen
Triebwerkes im rauhen Alltagsbetrieb herangezogen worden.  So wurde vom
Werk auch eine gro&szlig;z&uuml;gige Kulanzregelung bei Motorproblemen
geboten, meistens fielen zur damaligen Zeit nicht mehr Kosten als die
einer gro&szlig;en Inspektion f&uuml;r die mutigen Kunden an. Per
Expre&szlig; wurde ein Ersatzaggregat herangeschafft und gegen das
waidwunde ausgetauscht. Die ausgebauten Motoren wurden im Werk auf ihre
Schw&auml;chen untersucht, die h&auml;ufigsten Ausfallursachen
lokalisiert und sofort behoben und flossen als Verbesserungen in die
laufende Kleinserienfertigung ein.

<P> <IMG SRC = "../Images-GG/gg-pan-spi.jpg" WIDTH = 199 HEIGHT = 173
LOWSRC = "../Images-GG/gg-pan-spi-h043.jpg" ALIGN = LEFT>

<P> Um die Leistungsf&auml;higkeit des neuen Triebwerkes eindrucksvoll
zu beweisen, nahmen die Fahrzeuge an zahlreichen motorsportlichen
Wettbewerben erfolgreich teil. Im Jahre 1966 wurde Karlheinz Pannowitz
Deutscher Gran-Tourisme-Rallye Meister und 1967 wurde Siegfried
Spie&szlig; auf dem NSU Wankel-Spider Deutscher Automobilbergmeister
aller Hubraumklassen und Kategorien. Der bei Sportveranstaltungen als GT
mit 1000 ccm eingestufte Spider, also 2/3 seines theoretisch
m&ouml;glichen Gesamthubraums. Noch heute werden Autos mit Wankelmotor
in Deutschland nicht nach Hubraum, da es diesen ja eigentlich gar nicht
gibt, sondern nach dem zul&auml;ssigen Gesamtgewicht versteuert.

<P>

<BR>

<CENTER> <IMG SRC = "../Images-GG/gg-gtspid66-h272.gif" HEIGHT = 272
WIDTH = 301> </CENTER>

<P> Nachdem erste sportliche Erfolge von Werksfahrzeugen gesammelt
worden waren, entschlo&szlig; man sich zu Anfang des Jahres 1966
f&uuml;r interessierte Sportfahrer eine Sonderserie mit einem getunten
Motor, der jetzt 65 PS bei 7500 min-1 leistete, ein verbessertes
Fahrwerk mit verst&auml;rkten Bremsen und ge&auml;ndertem Fahrwerk
anzubieten. Diese Fahrzeuge wurden direkt vom Werk aus beim T&Uuml;V in
Heilbronn im Einzelabnahme f&uuml;r den Stra&szlig;enverkehr
zugelassen. Da der Wankelmotor keine Nockenwelle und Ventile besitzt,
war es ein leichtes den Motor durch &Auml;nderung des Einla&szlig;kanals
und die Verwendung einer optimal abgestimmten Abgasanlage an die neuen
Bedingungen anzupassen. Da der Motor bei hohen Drehzahlen sich nicht
selbst abregelt sind Drehzahlorgien bis in vierstellige Regionen
m&ouml;glich gewesen, was allerdings den zahlreichen filigranen
Dichtelementen im Dauerbetrieb nicht besonders gut bekommen
ist. Leistungssteigerungen bis zu 100 PS sind im reinen Rennbetrieb
realisiert worden.

<IMG SRC = "../Images-GG/gg-kkm502p.jpg" WIDTH = 320 HEIGHT = 264 LOWSRC
= "../Images-GG/gg-kkm502p-h066.jpg" ALIGN = LEFT>

<P> Zum Fahren eines normalen Spiders im Alltagsbetrieb ben&ouml;tigt
man keine besondere Eingew&ouml;hnungsphase, empfehlenswert ist doch der
Blick auf den serienm&auml;&szlig;igen elektronischen Drehzahlmesser, um
den roten Bereich jenseits von 7500 min-1 nicht allzu oft zu ignorieren,
da keinerlei mechanische Ger&auml;usche hier Einhalt gebieten. Mit
wachsenden Drehzahlen gibt sich das kleine Kraftpaket, das fast
unscheinbar ans Getriebe angeflanscht ist, mit turbinenartigen
Laufeigenschaften wesentlich zufriedener als im etwas rauhen Leerlauf,
wo es an einen Zweitaktmotor erinnert.

<P> Im Wankelmotor l&auml;uft ein echter Viertaktproze&szlig; ab, bei
jeder Umdrehung der Exzenterwelle wird ein 270 Grad Arbeitstakt
ausgef&uuml;hrt, dabei dreht sich der L&auml;ufer mit einem Drittel der
abgegebenen Drehzahl in einer kreisenden Bewegung um die zentrale
Exzenterwelle.

<P> Doch trotz des wackeren Erscheinungsbildes und der hervorragenden
Fahreigenschaften des kleinen Sportwagens kam er w&auml;hrend seiner
Bauzeit von 1964 bis 1967 nicht &uuml;ber eine Produktionszahl von 2375
Einheiten hinaus. Heute sind beim Kraftfahrtbundesamt in Flensburg noch
100 Fahrzeuge registriert. Sie verk&ouml;rpern auch heute noch mit viel
Aufwand in Betrieb gehalten, den Pioniergeist der NSU Konstrukteure und
der Bereitschaft sich neuen Aufgaben zu stellen.

<P> Der NSU Wankel-Spider lieferte f&uuml;r das Werk wertvolle
Erkenntnisse &uuml;ber den neuen Motor und die Problematik des unsteten
Fahrzeugbetriebes, die wertvolle Hilfen bei dem bereits in der
Entwicklung befindlichen gro&szlig;en Wankel-Wagen, dem <A
HREF = "nsu.html#Ro80">Ro80</A> lieferten, der in seinem Vorstellungsjahr
als revolution&auml;rstes Auto mit fl&uuml;sterndem Wankelmotor und
revolution&auml;rem aerodynamischem Karosseriedesign neue
avantgardistische Ma&szlig;st&auml;be setzte und daf&uuml;r zu Auto des
Jahres 1967 gek&uuml;rt wurde. Doch da&szlig; ist eine andere
Geschichte.

<H1> Jim Downing's Racing Team </H1>

<H2> 24 Hours of Le Mans 1996, June 15th and 16th </H2>

<P> Jim Downing's team (incl. Y. Terada and F. Freon) finished 25th
after a five hour pit stop.  They won the LMP2 class.  The team was one
of 10 invited and so was exempt from pre-qualifying. They were the
Mazdaspeed team, car #20.

<H2> 24 Hours of Daytona 1996 </H2>

<P> Jim Downing led his Mazda Kudzu DLM No. 63 to third place in the
1996 24 Hours of Daytona, winning a purse of $24,850.  They <A HREF =
"http://www.p9.com/daytona_grid.html">started</A> at position 10 with a
time of 1:48.355.  The drivers were Jim Downing, Butch Hamlet, Tim
McAdam, and Barry Waddell.  They completed 697 laps.  Hamlet passed a
Porsche on the last lap to take third.  They might have placed higher
but not for a gearbox rebuild in the 21st hour.  Here is what two of the
drivers had to say:

<DL>

<DT> Jim Downing: <DD> We were in third place in WSC in the second
hour, at least briefly. Then we managed to shoot ourselves in the foot a
few times. We had a long stop when a gear tooth broke, we had a new
A-arm break, but nothing real big, other than the gearbox. I'm
thrilled. For a new car to make this distance is about all you can hope
for.

<DT> Barry Waddell: <DD> This was my first 24-hour race. The Downing
team has done this race a lot and they made my first stint at this very
comfortable. The car was very comfortable every stint I did,
particularly at the end, which was just as fast as at the beginning. The
car got better as the driver got better, and I enjoyed it a lot.

</DL>

<P> Hardy Haussecker's GTS-2 Pettit Racing Mazda RX-7 was <A HREF =
"http://198.133.164.203/Issues/4354.html">eliminated in the 24th
hour</A> when another driver hit the car.

<H2> 12 Hours of Sebring March 17, 1996 </H2>

<H1> Hercules W2000 (DKW) </H1>

<P> <EM> Thanks are due to Reiner Nikulski who submitted this page.</EM>

<P> The Hercules (Herkules) works have existed for more than 100 years
and are one of the oldest motorbike works. They belong to the Sachs
group who produce automotive products like clutches, shock absorbers and
small engines for severall purposes.  Sachs was one of the first
licensees of the new <A HREF = "nsu.html">NSU</A> / <A HREF =
"dr-wankel.html">Wankel</A> rotary engine in 1960.  They developed and
built more than 35,000 Wankel engines mostly for stationary purposes.
Characteristic was the air-cooling and the charge-cooled rotor.  The
biggest one was the 294 cc "KM 914" for generators and snowmobiles.
This KM 914 was the basis of all Hercules and <A HREF =
"norton.html">BSA (later Norton)</A> motorbikes.

<P> The first Hercules W 2000 was shown at the German IFMA motorbike
show in 1970 to see the public's reaction on a rotary bike. It had the
Sachs KM 914 engine and a BMW gearbox and driveshaft. Only one prototype
was produced.

<P> In 1973 Hercules built 50 W 2000 in a "pre-series" and sold them
only to Hercules dealers.  It had the KC 24 engine, which was based on
the KM 914 but was fitted for use in motorbikes.  A six-speed gearbox
with chain-drive was now installed. Characteristic for the pre-series
bikes was the yellow fuel tank.

<P> Production began in 1974 with the KC 27 engine. The Bike was sold in
England as DKW because that name was more popular in England and Sachs
owned the rights of that name, too. Special motorbikes based on the W
2000 have been driven in long-distance races and were very succesful in
off-road sports. A 50,000 km endurance test at the N&#252;rburgring in
1975 showed very low wear.  Hercules made prototype studies with a
water-cooled engine in a BMW/5 frame and a more conventional looking
engine on a 7 speed gearbox of the Hercules GS Two-stroke.  For the last
year of production the W 2000 got an oil-injector to avoid the mixing of
fuel and oil.  Overall 1800 Hercules W 2000 have been built.  After
stopping the production of rotary engines Sachs sold the tooling
machines to Norton. There is a IG Hercules W 2000 in germany, a DKW
owners club in England and a "Rotary Recycle" in USA.

<H2> Ford Tightens Embrace of Mazda </H2>

<EM> Reported on RX-7 mail list. </EM>

<P> Tokyo, April 12, 1996 (Reuter)

<P> Mazda Motor Corp said on Friday it and Ford Motor Co had agreed on a
closer tie-up aimed at creating the world's strongest automobile group
in the future.

<P> "Mazda and Ford have agreed to boost the existing strategic
cooperation on a global basis," Mazda said in a statement issued in
Tokyo.  "The strengthening of the ties means a continuation of the
business relationship between the two companies which started in the
1960s and a steady expansion of the relationship which followed an
equity tie-up in 1979. With this move we aim to become the world's
strongest group in the future," it said.

<P> Ford will boost its stake in Mazda to 33.4 percent from 22.54
percent and install a seconded Ford executive as Mazda's president, the
statement said.  Analysts say the one-third stake will give the U.S. car
giant a greater say in the running of Mazda, Japan's fifth-largest
vehicle manufacturer.

<P> Under the deal, Mazda will also make an allocation of 144.1 million
shares to Ford worth 52.3083 billion yen ($484 million). Mazda said this
needed governmental approval.

<P> Mazda said its president Yoshihiro Wada would become chairman and be
replaced by Henry Wallace, a Ford official already seconded to Mazda and
currently serving as Mazda's executive vice president.

<P> Through the agreement, Mazda and Ford would aim to increase their
respective profits, Mazda said, adding that the agreement would not
involve any sacrifice by either firm.

<P> Mazda said it would maintain a clear, separate identity and continue
its own distribution of Mazda-developed products.  It also said it would
maintain its own distribution network.  The agreement would allow both
companies to fully utilise their resources in order to boost efficiency
and competitiveness, Mazda said.  "We will each become a source of
products to the other in order to increase efficiency and gain from the
merits of scale to further boost competitiveness," it said.

<P> Mazda said Sumitomo Bank Ltd, a key shareholder, positively
supported its agreement with Ford. It did not elaborate.

<H2> Ford takes wheel at Mazda with new president, ups stake </H2>

<KBD> From: bclark@ccmailpc.ctron.com </KBD>

<P> TOKYO - Ford Motor Co. is taking the wheel at Mazda Motor Corp., a
move that could give the U.S. company a foothold in Asia and provide a
much-needed boost for the ailing Japanese automaker.

<P> The two companies said in a joint statement Friday that Ford would
increase its share in Mazda to 33.4%, and that Mazda's president would
step aside, ceding management control to a former Ford executive.

<P> The increased share alone does not give Ford control, but analysts
said that coupled with the management shakeup, it effectively puts the
U.S. company in the driver's seat.  "Ford and Mazda believe that closer
coordination of our cooperative strategies and plans, particularly in
the areas of product development, manufacturing and distribution of
vehicles, will enable both companies to improve competitiveness and to
achieve improved economies of scale and efficiencies," Wayne Booker,
executive vice president of Ford, said in a statement.

<P> Analysts saw benefits for both companies.

<P> "This means that Mazda has decided that it would be very difficult
to accomplish financial recovery on its own," said Masahiro Kushida, an
auto analyst at Daiwa Research Institute, a private research
organization.  "It's a big relief for Mazda that it can expect firm
backing from Ford."  Ford, for its part, can benefit from Mazda's
technology know-how in compact cars, while raising its profile in Asia,
Kushida said.

<P> In recent years, Ford has been pouring cash and management expertise
into Mazda, which has seen its sales sag significantly since the decade
began. Ford bought about 25% of Mazda in 1979, and had maintained the
level of its stake until now.

<P> Under the shakeup, Mazda's president, Yoshihiro Wada, will take the
largely ceremonial post of chairman. Wada is a banker who had been sent
in from Sumitomo Bank, the second-largest shareholder in Mazda after
Ford.  Replacing him is former Ford Venezuela president Henry Wallace,
who became executive vice president of the Japanese company in 1994.

<P> Mazda said in a statement that it would maintain a "distinct
identity" and would continue to offer its own products through its own
distribution channels.

<P> In recent years, Mazda's high domestic production ratio and
dependence on exports have made it vulnerable to the strong yen, which
makes Japanese products more expensive overseas.  Mazda's performance in
the U.S. market has been dismal. Its U.S. sales in 1995 fell 24% from
the previous year. So far in 1996, its sales have been down 18% from a
year ago.  And the automaker lost $380 million in the fiscal year that
ended in March 1995. It was in the midst of a restructuring program to
trim its payrolls to 26,000 workers by March this year, for a total
reduction of 4,000 jobs over three years.  Larger Japanese automakers
like Toyota and Honda have had better success in shielding themselves
from currency fluctuations by aggressively moving production offshore.

<P> Ford and Mazda jointly manufacture vehicles in Michigan and New
Zealand, and they have announced a venture to build pickup trucks in
Thailand. They also have collaborated on the development of vehicles,
the latest being the 1997 versions of the Ford Escort and Mercury
Tracer.

<HR>

<P> Can anyone report on the Detroit News Business page from Sunday
Apr. 7?  With the color picture of a red RX-7 under the title
"... failure of Japanese Marketing".  Apparently Autoweek shows a
Miata at the New York Auto Show with "RX lines".

1974 RX-4 <A HREF = "#Wagon">Wagon</A>

<P> The powerful 13B engine made its debut in 1974 with the advent of
the RX-4 and broadened its availability when it appeared in the RX-5
Cosmo in 1976.  That year ports were shrunk for better fuel economy.
When both lines were discontinued in 1978, the engine went into
hibernation until 1984 when it appeared in the RX-7 GSL-SE.

<P> Rotor tips came with cast-iron <A HREF = "seals.html">seals</A>
and the design was changed to two pieces.  There were now only three
side seals (from six).  Engine cooling was improved by increasing
the size of the passages.  Rotor recesses were deepened.

<P> Seats were either vinyl or crushed velour.  The speedometer read up
to 130 mph, the tach up to 8000 rpm.  The dash and the center console
were integrated.

<H2> <A NAME = "Sedan"> RX-4 Sedan </H2>

<P> The bumpers on the sedan and wagon had full length barrier strips,
unlike the coupe.  The sedan was overdecorated compared to the coupe and
wagon since it had an odd adornment of the C pillar (rear pillar).

<HR>

<H1> RCE Theory and Design </H1>

<H2> The RCE Rotor Moves Inside an Epitrochoid Curve </H2>

<P> A Rotary Combustion Engine (RCE) as invented by <A HREF =
"dr-wankel.html">Felix Wankel</A> and developed by Walter Froede differs
from a <A HREF = "glossary.html#piston-engine">Piston Engine</A> in four
primary ways:

<UL>

<LI> The RCE Rotor supercedes the piston engine's piston.

<LI> The RCE Eccentric Shaft [<A HREF =
"glossary.html#eccentric">gloss</A>] supercedes the piston engine's
crankshaft and connecting rods.

<LI> The RCE Peripheral Housing [<A HREF =
"glossary.html#peripheral">gloss</A>] supercedes the piston engine's
cylinder.

<LI> Intake and exhaust ports [<A HREF = "glossary.html#port">gloss</A>]
in the housings eliminate valves, camshafts, and timing belts.

</UL>

<P> The Housing shape is an epitrochoid [<A
HREF="glossary.html#epitrochoid">gloss</A>] curve (more properly,
peritrochoid) [<A HREF="glossary.html#peritrochoid">gloss</A>].  It is
generated by rolling a circle around another circle.  The rolling circle
is half the size of the generating circle.  Drexel provides an extended
discussion of the <A HREF =
"http://wwwtdec.coe.drexel.edu/TDEC/MFE/comp_alg/eewm/exploration15/exp15-deriv.html">mathematics</A>
of the epitrochoid curve and the rotor shape.

<P> <STRONG> Java Demonstration of <A HREF="j-epi.html">Generating an
Epitrochoid</A> (about 44 KB) </STRONG>

<H2> The Wankel RC Engine is an Otto Cycle Engine (Four "Stroke") </H2>

<P> <STRONG> Java Demonstration of <A HREF="j-wankel.html">RC Engine
Cycles</A> (about 104 KB) </STRONG>

<H2> There are two main types of RCE </H2>

<UL>

<LI> <A NAME="KKM"> <B> KKM </B> </A> <EM> Kreiskolbenmotor </EM> or
planetary rotation motor (PLM), distinguished by one stationary
peripheral housing.  The rotor moves in an orbit and propels an
eccentric shaft.  This is easier to manufacture, cool, and maintain than
DKM.  Intake and exhaust passages are better.  Better cooling is
achievable.  It is more compact.  Modern rotaries are KKM types.

<LI> <A NAME="DKM"> <B> DKM </B> </A> <EM> Drehkolben Maschine </EM> or
single-rotation engine (SIM), the first RCE, has the distinctive feature
of an inner rotating housing and rotor moving in circular motion around
a fixed central shaft.  This requires disassembling the motor to change
spark plugs, perhaps the main reason it was discarded.  However, DKM is
the smoothest of the two, and high rates beyond 25,000 rpm are possible.
Bearing loads are lighter.

</UL>

<P> The rotary combustion engine must not be confused with "rotary"
aircraft engines which are piston cylinders arranged in a circle.  The
whole engine rotates.

<H2> Advantages </H2>

<UL>

<LI> Light weight and compact.

<LI> Smooth:  no reciprocating motion.

<LI> Extended power "stroke" rotation of the output shaft: 270 degrees
vs. the 180 degrees of a piston.

<LI> Fewer moving parts: no valves, connecting rods, cams, timing
chains.  Intake and exhaust timing are accomplished directly by the
motion of the rotor.

<LI> Flat torque curve because no valves are used.

<LI> Cooler combustion means fewer oxides of nitrogen.  Catalytic
converters lessen this advantage.

<LI> Separation of combustion region from intake region is good for
<A HREF="hydrogen.html">hydrogen</A> fuel.

</UL>

<H2> Disadvantages </H2>

<UL>

<LI> High surface to volume ratio in combustion chamber is less 
thermodynamically efficient.  The Wankel's long and narrow chamber
makes for long flame travel, but this is countered by the Mazda's
two spark plugs (three on some racing engines).

<LI> Higher fuel consumption.  Thus <A HREF="mazda.html">Mazda</A> has
been successful with the <A HREF="rx-7.html">RX-7 sports car</A>, a market
where fuel consumption is less of an issue.  Only 16 years after the
first engine ran, the 1973 oil crisis devastated the RCE before it had
sufficiently developed to become more economical.

</UL>

<H2> History of Rotary Machines </H2>

<P> Designs for rotary engines were proposed as early as 1588 by
Ramelli, though it took the development of the Otto cycle engine in 1876
and the advent of the automobile in 1896 to set the stage for a proper
rotary combustion engine.

<P> Other early designs were made by Huygens in 1673 and Kepler.  James
Watt made a rotary piston steam engine in 1759.

<HR>

<P> Wankel engines use cycloidal gearing, an old and unusual form of
gearing used in watches, Roots blowers, screw compressors, and pumps.

<H2> Mazda Weighs Plans </H2>

<BLOCKQUOTE> Mazda is weighing plans to market a hydrogen fueled auto
said to outperform electric vehicles. One of the biggest remaining
questions is when to start. Mazda says timing of the launch hinges on a
government program to develop a hydrogen fuel distribution
network. Japan's MITI reportedly aims to have infrastructure in place to
support widespread use of hydrogen as a transport fuel by 2010. Mazda
claims its hydrogen vehicle - based on a Wankel rotary engine - has a
range of 230 km and a top speed of 150 km/hr. By comparison, the
automaker says, electric vehicles typically can travel no more than 180
km without recharging and achieve top speeds of 130 km/hr, while
gasoline fueled cars have ranges as high as 590 km and top speeds of 183
km/hr. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<H2> <A NAME = "test"> The Search for Low-pollution Vehicles Continues </H2>

Mazda has begun a two year trial period for its experimental
low-pollution hydrogen rotary engine (RE) vehicle.  The Cappella Cargo
van model vehicle will burn a hydrogen fuel that when burned will not
emit carbon dioxide.  <A HREF = "mazda.html">Mazda</A> will lend the
vehicle to the Hirohata Steel Mill for use as their company van and
driven for at least 20,000 kilometers.

From: monito@ (<A HREF="../index1.html">Alan Marr</A>)
Subject: Hydrogen Rotaries: the facts
</PRE>

<P> Mazda Hydrogen fueled cars have all been rotaries:

<PRE>
HR-X1  not hydride, 2 seat, spacy commuter look.
HR-X2  metal hydride, 4 seat, dowdy.
MX-5   metal hydride, Miata body, front twin rotor, rear drive.
</PRE>

<P> Hydrogen has a low ignition temperature so the standard four stroke
engine is prone to pre-detonation and backfiring through the intake
ports.  The <A HREF="rce.html">rotary engine</A> separates the intake
ports from the combustion area so there are no hot spots in the intake
phase.

<P> The hydrogen Miata is 400 kg (880 lb) heavier than the standard car.
This is partly because a 300 kg (660 lb) H2 fuel tank replaces the
standard 50 kg (110 lb) for a full gasoline tank.
Thus it is encouraging that it performs as well as it does.
Intriguingly, the prototype has a left side driver (US).  Mazda also
has an electric prototype using fuel cells, also with a 400 kg
increase in weight.  MX-5 is the international designation of Miata.

<PRE>
			Gasoline	Hydrogen	Electric
Power (HP)              120             110
Top Speed kmh (mph)	183 (114)	150 (93)	130 (81)
0-40 kmh (25 mph) sec	  2.5		  2.9		  4.2
0-100 kh (62 mph) sec	  9.4		 13.0		 21.5
Refueling time            3 minute?      15 minute       hours?
</PRE>

<P> The view from the driver's seat:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
    Inside the hydrogen car, everything is standard apart from a small
    pressure instrument - the fuel gauge...  Starting the hydrogen car
    is no different from starting the petrol model, and engine noise
    sounds familiar too.
</BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE>
    ... the intake system combines a pre-mix air/fuel system for light
    load driving...  There is also a direct-injection system through a
    dedicated hydrogen port which opens when the air intake port is
    closed.  This is effective in increasing available power for
    higher speed driving...
</BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE>
    When the fuel pressure gets low, the power drops noticeably and
    the car slows dramatically.  Changing down the gears makes little
    or no appreciable difference and even with 20 percent pressure
    available, the car is effectively unable to carry on.  Refuelling
    these prototypes takes about 15 minutes from start to finish.
</BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE>
    The electric car is completely different...  There is very little
    engine braking so you have to start using the brakes much earlier
    than normal.  And the engine is virtually silent, which make tire
    and wind noise much more apparent.
</BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE>
    Battery technology is holding up the whole electric car movement:
    development has failed to produce a satisfactory alternative to
    nickel cadmium batteries (like those in the Mazda) or the standard
    lead acid type which cause so many of the problems.  They make
    electric cars heavy, expensive, and poor performers, with very few
    miles possible between each lengthy charge-up.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P> Mazda is investing much more heavily in hydrogen research than
electricity.  Seiji Tanaka, head of Mazda R&#38;D, says

<BLOCKQUOTE>
    Our first objective is to use available fuels more efficiently by
    producing better engines.  At present we are researching the
    Miller cycle and developing lean-burn technology.  Our second
    objective is to investigate alternative fuels such as natural gas
    and methanol and electric cars.  But this will not cut pollution.
    Hydrogen offers many advantages over all these, especially
    electric cars, and with the rotary fuelled by hydrogen,
    performance is very close to the petrol engine.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P> Japan's MITI is sponsoring the New Sunshine Project.  The goal is to
use hydrogen power "to replace 3 percent of electrical power, 10
percent of city gas use and 5 percent of transportation energy supply
by 2010".

<P> Mazda is trying to convince the California Air Resources Board to
admit the hydrogen rotary as a Zero Emission vehicle.  The issue is
the tiny amounts of hydrocarbon output because of the engine
lubricant.

<P> Hydrogen faces infrastructure hurdles and public concern over safety.
Metal hydrides are a safe mobile storage method.  Hydrogen is in some
ways safer than gasoline since the vapour rises into the atmosphere
and doesn't collect on the ground.

<H2> <A NAME="HRX-2"> HRX-2 at 30th Tokyo Motor Show </H2>

<P> Mazda's HRX-2 "is powered by a hydrogen burning rotary engine and
has a virutally 100% recyclable body structure.  It's been developed
with the potential to use liquid-crystal polymer fibre-reinforced
plastic.  This plastic is in the process of further research for
practical use.  The plastic-made upper-body can be easily detached from
the metal chassis.  The electrical and control systems are integrated
into one area.  Therefore, this structure makes it easier to disassemble
the body and to sort, by material make-up.  The HRX-2 is an updated
version of the HR-X which was exhibited at the 29th Tokyo Motor Show.
it has improvements in driving performance and cruising range."
<EM> Quoted from the page on <A
HREF = "http://www.worldtel.com/cajad/manufact/mazda/mazinfo.htm"> Mazda
Motor Corporation</A>.</EM>

<HR>

<P> Mazda Motor Corp is already bench-testing a Miata equipped with a
hydrogen-powered rotary engine as part of its bid to be the first
automobile manufacturer to market a hydrogen-powered vehicle.  Mazda
expects the vehicle to have a one-tank range of 248 miles, which is
twice as long as that of the HR-X concept car shown at the 1991 Tokyo
Motor Show.  The hydrogen-powered rotary engine is also being tested in
Mazda's Capella Cargo wagon.

<P> This <A HREF = "http://157.182.81.100/H2/Hydrogen">review</A>
provides a good overview of hydrogen as it can be applied to internal
combustion engines, but makes no specific mention of the RCE.

<P> The two following items are from <EM>Hydrogen Today</EM>, Vol. 4, No. 1,
1993, official publication of the <A
HREF="http://www.getnet.com/charity/aha/">American Hydrogen
Association</A>.

<H2> Mazda Advances Environmentally-Correct HR-X:  Powered by Hydrogen </H2>

<P> The refined Mazda HR-X shown above is a concept car that runs on
pure, renewable hydrogen, and emits primarily only water vapor.  It has
been improved since its original debut in 1991 by Mazda engineers to
improve its performance and increase its fuel efficiency. The Mazda
vehicle shows that hydrogen can be safely used as a fuel.

<P> The metal hydride tank is shown being fueled below, with one
hydrogen fuel line, and two lines which run cooling water through the
tank.  During refueling, the metal hydride in the tank warms as it
absorbs hydrogen, and the water cools it to allow more to be
absorbed. When the engine is running, the warm engine coolant water is
circulated through the tank to warm the metal hydride, causing the
hydrogen fuel to be released.

<P> Unlike piston-engines, the rotary engine has separate intake and
combustion chambers.  This allows the rotary engine to avoid the
backfiring and preignition problems that other engines have experienced.
The rotor draws the air and hydrogen in as it passes the top of the
cycle, then moves the mixture to the lower right and compresses it,
where it is ignited to drive the engine.

<P> The HR-X hydrogen car's rotary engine delivers 100 horsepower, which
is nearly the same as the <A HREF = "rx-7.html">original RX-7</A>.  This
concept car, shown at the Tokyo Motor Show, and auto shows in New York
and Los Angeles, has generated much excitement and public awareness of
hydrogen as a fuel with today's technology.  Mazda's break ahead of the
other auto companies is truly an advancement to the solar hydrogen
industry.

<H2> Remarks at Solar Hydrogen Industrial Workshop at UCLA, Ca, Feb. 8,
1993 </H2>

<P> Vahe Kluejian, Manager of Research, Mazda Motor Company:

<P> Mazda developed the hydrogen fueled rotary engine as an option to
meet new emission standards.  The rotary engine is more difficult to
reduce emissions in, except with hydrogen.  With the oncoming ZEV,
hydrogen is the future fuel.  Mazda plans to use metal hydrides or any
nonliquid for safety.  Their main problem has been convincing regulators
that hydrogen is viable.  Mazda has built three test vehicles, and more
are being built for real-world standards for fleet testing and
demonstration.  Mazda's hydrogen car can be made commercial in 1998-2000
per the ZEV specification.

<H2> <A NAME = "Matsuda"> Jujiro Matsuda (1875 - 1952) </H2>

<P> Matsuda was born August 6, 1875, 12th son of a fisherman in the
Hiroshima Prefecture.  His father died when he was three years old.  At
the age of 13 he got a job in a blacksmith shop in Osaka.  At the age of
20, in 1894 he started his own shop and employed 50 workers, but a
recession drove him out of business.  He tried again eleven years later
in converted cow shed.  His eldest son, Tsuneji (1897?-1971), pumped air
for the furnace.

<P> Jujiro Matsuda invented and patented a pump. It sold well, so he
formed the Matsuda Pump Partnership.  He was edged out a few years later
when the company was taken over.

<P> In 1912 Jujiro formed Matsuda Works.  In one year it employed 4000
workers to produce four million artillery fuses for the Russian Czar's
government.  Then it became Japan Armament Manufacturing Company.
Later he left to create a new Matsuda Works in Hiroshima.  Nihon Steel
Manufacuring Co. took this over.

<H2> <A NAME = "Toyo"> Toyo Kogyo 1920, 1927 </H2>

<P> A group of investors including Matsuda took over a failing Abemaki
tree cork company in January 1920, naming it Toyo Cork Kogyo Company
Limited.  Toyo means Orient and Kogyo means industry. Jujiro became
president the next year.

<P> In September 1927, Matsuda reformed the company as Toyo Kogyo Kaisha
(Company) Limited to grow out of Cork and into industrial production.  A
test run of 30 motorcycles were manufactured in 1930 or earlier, since
one of them won a race that year.

<H2> <A NAME = "MazdaDA"> Mazda Type DA Motorized Tricycle Truck 1931 </H2>

<P> Ahura Mazda is the Zoroastran lord of light, creator of the
universe.  The name is also very close to Matsuda.  Toyo Kogyo
successfully produced these 500cc three wheelers with differential
transmissions beginning in 1931.  A small passenger sedan protoype was
made in 1940, but this had to be abandoned.

<H2> <A NAME = "recovery"> Recovery after Atom Bomb </H2>

<P> The atom bomb was dropped on August 6, 1945, but the company was
fortunate that less than half of the plant was destroyed.  In 1950 Toyo
Kogyo produced the Type CT three-wheeler with 1157 cc V twin (32 bhp).
This was very successful.  In May 1960 the R360 air cooled coupe was
introduced with a 356 cc two cylinder rear mounted engine.  In 1962
there was the 358 cc four cylinder Carol sedan.  1963 saw the model
800 and Familia four with front engines and rear drive.

<P> Jujiro's son Tenuji became President of the Company in 1951. Jujiro
passed away in March 1952.  Tsuneji succumbed to a lung inflammation in
1971.  His son Kohei succeeded him until he stepped down in 1977.

<P> In 1984 the company name was changed to Mazda Motor
Corporation. Mazda has assembly plants in 21 countries and exports to
120 countries.

<P> In 1973, Mazda sold 104,960 cars in the US, twice the previous
year's total.  More than 92 percent had rotary engines.  The next year,
after the gas crisis had made its impact felt, Mazda sold only 61,192
cars in the US.

1976 when it was called X605.  The first prototype was completed in
1977.  It was introduced to America as a 79 model on April 24, 1978
since production began in March (<A HREF =
"http://aruba.ccit.arizona.edu/~rockd/brochure.html">brochure</A> (heavy
graphics)).  A slogan Mazda used was "It's the real thing. A sports car
with all the traditional virtues and then some."  One magazine's
headline was "The Rotary Revolution has begun".  Thus began Mazda's
passion for pure sport cars that has continued through three generations
and includes the Miata and <A HREF = "rx-01.html">RX-01</A>.

<P> The 12A engine (2 x 573 = 1146 cc) had two side intake ports and one
peripheral exhaust port per rotor.  There was a thermal reactor.
Transmissions were four and five speed manual and three speed auto.

<P> American models were two seaters only, though a 2+2 was offered in
Japan due to relaxed crash standards.

six port induction (2 by 3), and electronic fuel injection.  In Japan,
there was a P132 with a 12A turbocharged engine.  Power steering was
offered for the first time.  The interior was upgraded, but this did

<HR>

<P> David Wood wrote 11 Mar 1996 to rec.sport.snowmobiles:

<BLOCKQUOTE> Arctic Cat had at least two different rotary engines in
several different models.  First there was the 303.  This engine was
used until '74, I believe, and after that they used the 295.  Both
engines were made by Sachs.  The rotaries could be found in Panthers
(naturally, what engine couldn't?) and Cheetahs and probably others such
as the Puma.  I had a 75 Cheetah with the 295 and there were a few
things to look out for.  One, the recoil needed to be well greased at
all times.  There was a zerk fitting on the top for this purpose.  If it
wasn't lubricated the recoil had a tendency to self destruct.  Since the
fuel pump is *mechanical* on the 295 and driven by an eccentric on the
end of the crankshaft which sticks through the recoil the recoils are
difficult to find.  Two, the fuel pump.  If the eccentric bearing went
bad the end of the fuel pump push rod would get worn away and soon there
would be no fuel getting pumped.  Both of these problems are easy to
avoid with a little maintenance but would definitely be something to
look for if you were to buy one of these machines.  My Cheetah had a
boatload of torque and was great for a work sled.  Oh yeah, belts can be
kind of hard to find, too, because no one has the correct one listed for
that application and if you do have to replace a recoil or fuel pump
they were about $70 used 7 or 8 years ago.  </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE> OMC put 500cc rotaries in both Johnson and Evinrude
snowmobiles. They were very large sleds, but had electric start and
reverse to make them a little easier to live with.  These engines came
in two flavors, 35 and 45 horsepower.  I haven't heard much about the
35s but the 45s had some trouble with the shaft of the secondary
throttle plate breaking and allowing the plate into the engine thus
destroying the rotor housing.  I know two people that seem to have a
morbid fascination with these things and have at least half a dozen of
them between the two.  Most of them are just used for parts, however, as
only two of the 6 or so sleds are in running shape, so that says
something about the OMCs I would say.  </BLOCKQUOTE>

<P> The powerful 13B engine made its debut in 1974 with the advent of
the RX-4 and broadened its availability when it appeared in the RX-5
Cosmo in 1976.  That year ports were shrunk for better fuel economy.

<P> Rotor tips came with cast-iron <A HREF = "seals.html">seals</A>
and the design was changed to two pieces.  There were now only three
side seals (from six).  Engine cooling was improved by increasing
the size of the passages.  Rotor recesses were deepened.

<HR>

<H1> Engine Seals </H1>

<P> As early as 1924 <A HREF = "dr-wankel.html">Felix Wankel</A>
realized that sealing would be one of the biggest problems in developing
a rotary combustion engine.  In the late 20's and early 30's he made
many experiments.  His research in this field allowed him to make
several advances.  These led to contracts with BMW and other companies.

<P> There are two kinds of areas on the rotor that need sealing: the
apices (plural of apex) and the sides.  The peripheral housings are
actually slightly larger than a true epitrochoid.  This is done to
improve sealing by preventing unnecessary seal movement.

<P> Before 1986, the apex seals had two pieces, one of which is a small
triangle.  Since 1986, the long piece was split along its length
horizontally so now the apex seal is composed of three pieces.  The
thickness was reduced from 3 mm to 2 mm.  These seals are backed with a
single spring bar before 1986 and two spring bars from 1986 on.

<P> The material is cast iron alloy.  The top rubbing surface is
chill hardened by an electron beam.

<P> The side seals are 1.0 mm before 1986 and 0.7 mm there-after.  They
are made of sintered iron.  This provides some self-lubrication as it
rubs against the nitrided iron surface of the side housing.

<P> Water seals are used between the peripheral and side housings [<A
HREF = "glossary.html#housing">gloss</A>].  In 1986 the grooves in which
they fit were moved from the peripheral to the side housing.

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Wankel Engine</FONT> {wang'-kul}

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>T</FONT>he Wankel engine is an advanced type of
internal-combustion engine developed in 1956 by <A HREF =
"dr-wankel.html">Felix Wankel</A>, a German mathematician [engineer -
<FONT SIZE=-1>AM</FONT>].

<P> The <A HREF = "rce.html">Wankel engine</A> differs greatly from
conventional engines.  It retains the familiar intake, compression,
power, and exhaust cycle but uses, instead of a piston, cylinder, and
mechanical valves, a triangular rotor that revolves around the eccentric
[shaft].  The three apexes, or tips, of this rotor remain in constant,
snug contact with the combustion-chamber walls.  The only other moving
part is the crankshaft.  The Wankel engine has 40 percent fewer parts
and roughly one-third the bulk and weight of a comparable reciprocating
engine.

<P> In addition to the simplicity of design, there is little or no
vibration in the Wankel.  There are no problems with heat dissipation,
hot spots, or detonation, all of which are considerations in the
conventional reciprocating engine.  Wankel engines, most of which are
liquid-cooled, are capable of running at unusually high speeds for long
periods of time.  The motor exhibits a high power-to-weight ratio and an
exceptionally good torque curve at all engine speeds.

<P> Within the Wankel, three chambers are formed by the sides of the
rotor and the wall of the housing.  The shape, size, and position of
these chambers are constantly altered by the rotor's clockwise rotation
and the faster rotation of the eccentric [shaft].  The usual four-stroke
cycle occurs with the simple valving and power-stroke frequency of the
two-stroke engine.  The rotor opens the intake port and the fuel and air
enter as in the conventional engine.  The rotor continues, closing the
intake port by passing beyond it; then compression begins, followed by
ignition, combustion, and expansion for the power stroke until the apex
seal at the tip of the triangle opens the exhaust port.  The exhaust
cycle then takes place, again with no speed-restricting valve mechanism.
The engine is unique in that the power impulse is spread over
approximately 270 degrees of crankshaft rotation, as compared to 180
degrees for the conventional reciprocating two-stroke engine.  Although
it is still an experimental engine for most manufacturers, the Japanese
auto maker <A HREF = "mazda.html">Mazda</A> has used the Wankel to power
some of its <A HREF = "rx-7.html">sports models</A>.  The major problems
with Wankels -- or rotary engines, as they are often called -- has been
their low fuel efficiency and the difficulty of designing engines of
larger than two-rotor capacity.  In the late 1980s, however, a
three-rotor engine was introduced [to production].

Baier</A>, a Professor of Geometry at Technische Universit&auml;t
M&uuml;nchen, 1960-71 who worked with NSU and Wankel on eine
Rotationskolbenmaschine.  Wankel had arrived at the peripheral housing
shape by practical means.  In 1954 Baier identified the mathematical
classification of the shape as epitrochoidal [<A HREF =

1960 which gives some mathematical treatment of the RCE.  He assisted

<H2> Federation International de L'Automobile </H2>

<P> Production Cars (Group N), Touring Cars (Group A) and Grand Touring
Cars (Group B) may run rotary engines.  <A HREF =
"http://www2.fia.com/fia/regle/reg_tec/252-a.htm">Article 252</A> states
"The equivalent cubic capacity is 1.5 times the volume determined by the
difference between the maximum and minimum capacities of the combustion
chamber."

<H2> Rally Racing </H2>

<P> Malcolm Smith and Jack Sreenan won Mazda's first pro rally in 1975
at the SCCA Mojave 24 Hour Rally.  The vehicle was the Rotary Pickup
truck sponsored by Alaskan Brand.

<H2> Midget Racing </H2>

<P> Drew Fornoro drove Gene Angelillo's upright midget powered by a 13B
to the North East Midget Racing Association (NEMA) championship in 1985.
Racing officials decided to handicap the rotary engine and restricted it
to a 12A.  They won again in 1986 in a lay-down midget.  The association
decided to bar rotary combustion engines from competition, claiming they
had no way to measure it.

<LI> May 10, 1996: <STRONG> <A HREF = "independent.html">Wallace Vows to
Build Mazda</A></STRONG> "It is not a strategy (to let Mazda disappear).
It is a strategy to build Mazda".  Yearly earnings are to be released
next week. Mazda will have a quarterly meeting at the end of the month.

<LI> April 12, 1996: <STRONG> <A HREF = "ford.html">Ford Tightens
Embrace of Mazda</A></STRONG>.  Ford increased its ownership of <A HREF

"http://www.carmag.co.jp/news/9604/news_9604_002.html">Simulation
Technology for Mazda's Rotary Engine Wins Award"</A> </STRONG> from the
Japan Society of Mechanical Engineers.  Yuji Hamai of Mazda's Technical
Research Center did research titled "Numerical Study of the Flow Field
Inside Rotary Engines".  Some of the airflow in a rotary engine can
become supersonic, making simulation difficult.

<LI> April: There will be no 1997 RX-7 for sale in North America.

<LI> Feb. 20: <STRONG><A HREF = "groundless.html">Mazda Denies Demise of
Rotary</A></STRONG>.  Ronald Leicht (from Ford), Mazda's senior managing
director, said the engine's fate will depend on customer needs.  A Mazda

development, with eight Moller engines.  There is also an Aerobot.
Prospects look good and the Air Force has contracted production of 100
engines in Davis, California.

<LI> Aug. 1995: Mazda began a <A HREF = "hydrogen.html#test">two year

I attended several Forums ate Sun-N-Fun, and took notes which I
thought I might share.  I was principally interested in Mazda
Rotarys as a potential replacement for an io-360-a1a.  Below are
my notes of Crooks's Forum.  He has taken a conservative
approach, and come up with a 160Hp engine which looks likely to
be highly reliable.  Please understand that these are my notes
of his talk and may contain errors, and even if I took accurate
notes, I can't vouch for Crook's claims.

His engine is installed in an RV-4.  It is 934 lbs empty and has
a top speed of 200+.  The airframe is stock, including cowling.

The weak spot in the Mazda wankel basic design is the apex
sealing.  Mazda has had an acceptable solution to sealing since
1972.

Crook's goal was to match the power to weight ratio of a
Lycoming o-320, beat its cost and produce a solution in 6 months.

An o-320 has a published weight of 276lbs + accessories.
An o-320 weighs 355-385lbs all up minus the prop.
Crooks' Mazda weighs 340lbs all up minus the prop.

Note that published aircraft engine weights do not include many
systems and accessories and do not represent the all up weight
of the installed engine.

A overhauled o-320 goes for $8,000.00.  Crook built his engine
for $5,2200.00 and could easily best that price if he did it
again.

His engine is basically stock.  He made changes principally to
eliminate features that are obviously for automotive purposes. 
Principally to reduce emissions or to increase low end torque. 
Neither of which is needed for the aircraft application.

He made no changes that would increase BMEP since BMEP scales
with internal stress and high relyability was his goal rather
than high performance.

You should ask for coils and cooling parts for your engine at
the salvage yard [or better yet arrange to remove the engine
yourself].  These are not mounted to the engine and you save a
lot by having them included in the price of a salvaged engine.

He looked at a wide variety of engines and developed a short
list of o-320 replacements as follows:  Honda Prelude, Subaru
2.2l Legacy, and Mazda 13B.

The 13B has a higher fuel burn.  Crook vigured the increased
cost of auto fuel over the life of the engine was acceptable.

He burns 8.2 gph at 192 mph or at 75% power.
He usually cruises at 150 mph and burns 5.2 gph.

The crank (eccentric) shaft of the 13B is STOUT.  Crook has
heard of no failures of this part, even in auto racing.  The
rotors are also heavily built and are not prone to fail.

Redrives:  Powersport and Ross were discussed.  Crook mentioned
the problem that there are a lot of redrives marketed, but only
some vendors have actual stock developed and waiting to ship. 
Some are really still in the development phase. Crook used a
Ross unit.  The Ross unit uses a torsional isolating plate like
in an auto clutch.  The Ross unit uses the Ford C-6 planetary
gearset.  Powersport strives to eliminate gear lash [Everitt
Hatch in a seperate forum described their approach to torsional
resonance issues as one based on increasing the stiffness of the
system and thereby driving the harmonics up out of the
opperating range].  The Powersport costs 3 times as much as the
Ross unit.  The Ross installation guide calls for turning the
engine 90 degrees about the crank axis.  They probably did this
in order to stick the distributor out the side and keep it in
the cowl.  If you use an electronic fuel injection system
there's no reason to rotate the engine.  Crook mounted his
engine upright and beleives that this will help cooling since
1/3 of engine heat leaves via the oil cooler and the oil was
ment to drain down by Mazda.

Fuel System:  The stock fuel injection system is bulkey, and
unneseccarily complex for an aircraft application.  It is
designed to reduce emissions and to increase low end torque. 
Crook disregarded this and instead used three motorcycle carbs. 
In selecting the carbs he observed the following rules.  1) all
carbs mix fuel in the same ratio 2) in general you need 1 square
inch of carb throat for each 50Hp.  You might need more area on
an engine with especially short sharp intake breaths, but the
Mazda makes a long smooth inhale.  He used three carbs for the
simple reason that he had three sets of holes on the block to
cover.

By using three carbs he gains the added benifit of induction
redundancy.  Ehe engine will run at reduced Hp on the center
carb alone, or on the outside carbs together without the center
carb.

Ignition:  On a 1985 or earlier engine, the stock distributor
will work even if the engine had electronic ignition.  The Mazda
comes stock with two plugs per combustion chamber so it seems a
shame to abandon the opportunity to have completely redundant
ignition.  Having discarded the stock EFI the stock electronic
ignition went with it, so a new ignition system was called for. 
Crook is an electronics guy by trade so he developed his own
ignition modules. ( he will sell them at close to cost)

Cooling:  Center of Gravity considerations precluded adding a
belly scoop for radiators.  Crook used the empty space in the
RV-4s cheek cowls for his radiators.  He used automotive
airconditioning evaporator colers as radiators "they're not the
best radiators you can buy, but they're the best $5.00 radiators
you can buy."  The rotors are oil cooled and 1/3 of total engine
heat leaves by way of the oil.  It is essential to keep oil temp
below 210 degrees (measured after the oil cooler).  Otherwise
you will degrade the rubber oil seals on the sides of the
rotors.  Crook used the standard Mazda oil cooler.  Later
engines have an electric cooling oil bypass valve for the rotor
cooling.  This is to warm the engine up faster to reduce
emissions.  Failure of this valve could lead to grief.  Remove
it.

Exhaust:  The exhaust temp is about 200 degrees hotter than in a
piston engine.  Crook used 1-3/4 inch 321 stainless steel for
his exhaust.  He fiddled with tuning the exhaust, but at the Hp
he will be operating he found no significant advantage and
installed an untuned exhaust.  For 1986 engines or later an
engine installed in the car with a turbo can be run without the
turbo.  Crook recomends 1986 or later engines.  The engine is
LOUD without a muffler, but is quite quiet with a muffler
installed.

Intake:  Many Mazda's will tune intake.  Crook didn't.  His
intake runners are less than an inch.  The stock Mazda engine
has a valve within the block in the intakes that will restrict
flow under certain conditions to accelerate flow and improve low
end torque.  This is not needed in the aircraft and a failed
valve could cause engine damage.   Crook glued these open with
high temp epoxy.

The gasket in the rebuild kit is thicker than the one from the
factory.  The oil sealing o-ring isn't.  This spaces the faces
farther apart and leads to failure of the o-ring.  Crook says to
disregard the gasket and use standard gasket glop instead.

Crook now published a newsletter on Mazda conversion, and also a
manual on his conversion.  He will also sell ignition modules.

His planes's number is N84TC.

<H1> Mid-West Rotary Combustion Engines </H1>

<P> <STRONG>Mid-West Engines</STRONG> were kind enough to supply
substantial information which I turned into two pages, one containing <A
HREF = "mid-west-bkgd.html">background information</A>, and the other
containing <A HREF = "mid-west-eng.html">engine data</A>.  Those pages
should be consulted before proceeding with the rest of this page, which
mostly consists of diverse related information.

<P> In 1994 a Mid-West Aero engine was <A HREF =
"http://www.aviation.span.ch/flight/varia/ukpfa.html">mentioned
installed</A> in a Cessna 150 general aviation plane.  A Mid-West
water-cooled Wankel rotary in an 18m ASH-26E has now <A HREF =
"http://www.avnet.co.uk/MHonArc/europa.9510/msg00001.html">completed its
certification</A> in Germany.  
An engine has also been used by Glaser Dirks in a motorglider.

<P> A net correspondent reported that it was announced in <EM> Sport
Aviation </EM> that a Mid West 100 lb 90-100 hp engine has been
certified under JAR.  Price might be around $10,000.

<P> The University of Birmingham School of Manufacturing and Mechanical
Engineering <A HREF =
"http://www.bham.ac.uk/ManMechEng/Research/power.htm">Power Transmission
Laboratory</A> (PTL) is investigating rotary engines, beginning with "a
seal-less Wankel engine, which has developed into an Advanced Wankel
Engine Concept project" (AWEC) in cooperation with Mid-West "to develop
an adiabatic engine of greater performance" over the period 1994-97.

<P> The AWEC project seeks to attack the apex and side seal problems of
the Wankel engine by finding a way of eliminating them.  For aircraft
applications, the PTL is also conducting research into combining the
counterbalance weight into the shaft speed reduction gearbox to achieve
an overall reduction in weight.  PTL is looking into multi-rotored and
banked Wankel engines.

<HR>

<H1> Mid-West Engines:  Background </H1>

<EM> The following information was kindly supplied by Mid-West. </EM>

<P> Mid West Engines Ltd. located at Gloucestershire Airport, Staverton,
near Gloucester, has just confirmed satisfactory completion of the
development of its GAE100R rotary engine for light aircraft. This was
recognized on February 1st, 1996, by the official presentation to the
Company by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) of the engine's
Certification to JAR-E for Full Public Transport Category.

<P> The Mid West rotary engine is based on a design conceived by <A HREF
= "dr-wankel.html">Felix Wankel</A> in the 1930's although the first
functional prototype was not completed until the 1950's. Many companies
have investigated the potential of the Wankel rotary engine but only the
Japanese automobile company <A HREF = "mazda.html">Mazda</A> has it in
series production by fitting it to the high-performance <A HREF =
"rx-7.html">RX-7 sports car</A>.

<P> Mid West, attracted by the low vibration / high specific output of
the rotary engine, continued a development programme in 1994 to adapt
the basics of the <A HREF = "norton.html">Norton rotary motorcycle</A>
engine for manned-flight applications.

<P> The <A HREF = "rce.html">rotary engine</A> has only three main
components; the main housing is machined internally to an algebraic
formula conceived by Wankel, referred to as an epitrochoid, and bearing
a resemblance to a fat figure-of-eight. The rotor is triangular in shape
with convex flanks and runs on an eccentric portion of the output
shaft. An internal gear on one end of the rotor engages with a fixed
timing gear on an end housing, ensuring the correct orbital motion of
the rotor. Due to the reduction ratio of this gearing, the rotor spins
at only one third of the speed of the output shaft.

<P> Spring-loaded <A HREF = "seals.html">seals</A> at each of the three
corners of the rotor rub on the surface of the epitrochoid and separate
the individual phases of combustion occurring on each flank of the
rotor. As the rotor sweeps around inside the housing, each flank sees a
varying volume between itself and the housing and creating the
conventional phases of the four-stroke cycle: Induction : Compression :
Expansion : Exhaust.

<P> This sequence of events is occurring on each flank of the rotor and
results in a total of three power impulses for each complete revolution
of the rotor or one power impulse for every complete revolution of the
output shaft. In this respect, power delivery is similar to that of a
two-stroke engine.

<P> In a sequence similar to an axial-flow turbine engine, gases in the
rotary engine flow in one direction only; inducted gases following the
direction of rotor rotation through compression and then expansion to
exhaust. Thus the induction / compression section of the rotor housing
remains relatively cool whereas the expansion / exhaust section is much
hotter and requires careful management of cooling. Early automobile
engines suffered excessive rotor seal wear due in part to differential
expansion caused by this variation distorting the ideal machined
profiles.

<P> New and improved materials are now available, and solutions
developed by MWE using the latest technology have overcome the problems
resulting in a power unit lighter than a conventional reciprocating
engine, giving a long life between overhauls, and of particular interest
for aircraft applications.

<P> An almost unique feature of the Mid West rotary engine is that the
torque curve is flat over a very wide speed range. As horsepower is
effectively torque multiplied by speed, greater speed produces more
power, although as speed increases, internal losses (friction etc.) also
increase. However, the results of speed increases on reciprocating
engines can result in dramatic failures as stress levels multiply. Pure
rotary motion and near perfect dynamic balance of the Mid West engine
ensure that increasing speed does not cause significantly increased
stress levels. In practice, limiting speeds of Mid West engines are
established as a satisfactory balance between power output and an engine
life with a high margin of safety.

<P> Reduction gearboxes fitted as an integral part of Mid West rotary
engines and incorporating torsional dampers, allow the propeller to turn
 relatively slowly. The reduction ratio of the twin-rotor GAE100R unit,
for example, allows the propeller to experience six power impulses per
revolution. That sort of power  from a conventional direct-drive would
require a twelve cylinder four-stroke engine to achieve the same
smoothness of delivery. Similarly the single rotor GAE50R can be equated
to a six cylinder, direct-drive engine. Any vibration which may be felt
from a Mid West engine can almost certainly be attributed to imbalance
in the propeller.

<P> The GAE50R single rotor engine produced by Mid West carries
certification to JAR-22 and is being purchased by Alexander Schleicher
for the ASH 26 powered sailplane; to date, more than 120 units have been
delivered. The engine delivers 50 BHP at 7,500 rpm and is also suitable
for microlights, ultra-lights, etc.

<P> Liquid cooling of the main engine castings, patented forced-air
cooling of the rotor internals, precisely metered oil flow to the
bearings, and a sophisticated high energy duplicated ignition system all
contribute to the quality and reliability of the engines. Mid West,
drawing on experience of many thousands of hours of development testing
and on experience from their customers, are confident that their rotary
engines, designed, developed, and built by a small team at Staverton and
accredited by the CAA, are the best in the market.

<P> Technical specifications are available for two engines: <A HREF =
"mid-west-eng.html#GAE100R"> Type GAE 100 R</A> Certification to JAR - E
and <A HREF = "mid-west-eng.html#AE50R"> Type AE 50 R</A> Certification
to JAR - E.

<H1> Graupner/OS Model Engine </H1>

<H2> 5 cc </H2>

<P> This engine was designed by Graupner in West Germany and
manufactured by OS in Japan.  As far as I know, it has been manufactured
continuously since 1971 or earlier, though it was some time later that
they could be imported into the US because a license needed to be
negotiated with Curtiss-Wright.

<P> Clarence Lee wrote in RC Modeler magazine at that time "to say I was
very surprised and impressed with the performance of the engine would be
an understatement. ...this one really hauls!" (RC Modeler Magazine).

<P> Rotor and housings are steel.

<P> Power is remarkable, evocative of engines in the range of .35 to
.45, which is good because it weighs more than the average .30.
Operation of the engine is very smooth.  The engine responds well to
muffling and is very quiet.  The engine starts more easily if it is
"quite wet", which make sense for sealing.  Fuel consumption seemed a
little on the high side, about 8 to 10 minutes on a six ounce tank.

<H1> Rotary Engine Research, Especially Wankels </H1>

<P> Perhaps the most interesting area of research is Mazda's application
of <A HREF = "hydrogen.html">Hydrogen fuel</A> to the RCE.

<P> <A NAME = "Moller"> <A HREF = "http://bozemanlegg.com/~mi/">Moller
International</A> - Home of the RotaPower Engine.  "Making new concepts
in personal transportation a reality", which refers to their powered
lift vehicle in development, with eight Moller engines. There is also an
Aerobot.  The Air Force has contracted production of 100 engines.
Fascinating history from 1962.  There is a new color photograph of the
engine.

<P> The University of Birmingham School of Manufacturing and Mechanical
Engineering <A HREF =
"http://www.bham.ac.uk/ManMechEng/Research/power.htm">Power Transmission
Laboratory</A> is investigating rotary engines, beginning with "a
seal-less Wankel engine, which has developed into an Advanced Wankel
Engine Concept project" in cooperation with <A HREF =
"mid-west.html">Mid-West</A> "to develop an adiabatic engine of greater
performance."  They are also working on an oscillatory rotary engine
(ORE) (cat-and-mouse principle).

<P> The Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) is a large research facility
that has numerous automotive projects.  At the end of its 1995 Annual
Report section on <A HREF =
"http://www.swri.org/3pubs/ar1995/eflvs.htm">Engines, Fuels, Lubricants,
and Vehicle Systems</A> they remark about their contribution to ARPA
research in hybrid electric vehicles using natural gas: "Rotary and
turbine engines are [also] being investigated because they are able to
generate even higher power for a given engine density, and they can
provide significant reductions in scale and emissions."  On another page
they show an image of a <A HREF =
"http://www.swri.org/3PUBS/BROCHURE/D03/ELHYBVEH/order.HTM">hybrid
electric bus</A> which apparently has a rotary engine.



<P> It was reported in 1992 that research is continuing at Wankel R&D in
Lindau, Germany, under Dinkwort Eiermann.  This may be funded to some
extent by Daimler Benz.  If you know about this, please <A HREF =
"mailto:rce@monito.com">communicate</A> with the editor.

<P> <STRONG> Alternatives to the Wankel </STRONG>

<P> Prof. Jami.J. Shah reports about his research on <A HREF =
"http://asudesign.eas.asu.edu/projects/engine/">An Integrated Model of a
Rotary Engine</A> with David W. Toppenberg, graduate student at Arizona
State University <A HREF = "http://asudesign.eas.asu.edu/">MAE Design
Automation Lab</A>.  NASA is sponsoring.  The engine appears to have six
lobes in the housing and four lobes on the rotor.  The page has links to
three Figures about Heat Transfer, Solid Geometry, and Finite Elements.
Toppenberg did a Masters thesis on "Ultra-light Rotary Engine Design"
(8/92-5/94).

<P> See also the annotations about the <A HREF =
"annotated.html#RandCam">Rand Cam</A> engine and about <A HREF =
"annotated.html#miscellaneous">other variations of rotary engines</A>.

<P> David Munday reports on a talk Tracy Crook gave at the April 15,
1996 Sun-N-Fun on "<A HREF = "munday1.html">Mazda Performance
Update</A>".  Cook has a newsletter.

<P> <A HREF = "munday2.html"><EM>Contact!</EM></A> magazine has several
articles on Mazda conversions.

<P> Dave Klingler reports remembering that "Duncan Aviation used to
produce a single rotor version of a [Mazda] 12A, essentially a 12A cut
in half".  The weight may have been around 160 lbs, and power about
90-100 hp with tuned exhaust.  Duncan is a controversial figure.
Klingler continues "I knew him [Dan Duncan] for a short time, and around
me he was an extremely honest man and a wealth of information about
aviation rotaries."

<P> <A HREF =
"http://www.azstarnet.com/~cmddata/homebuilt/vendors/engines/powerplant.html">Michael
Kraus</A> lists many aircraft engines.  111 piston engines have power
and weight figures.  The power to weight ratios (hp to lb) vary from
0.33 to 0.86, and the average is 0.604.  Additionally, three Hirth F30
(two-stroke?), a "Wankel turbo", and a Solar T62 turbine are listed with
power to weight ratios of 0.94, 1.10, 1.20, 1.20, and 1.30 respectively.

<CENTER> <H2> Opinion </H2> </CENTER>

<H1> Whither Wankel? </H1>

<P> <EM> May 25, 1996 </EM>

<P> We find ourselves at a flexion point in the path of the Rotary
Combustion Engine (<A HREF = "rce.html">RCE</A>).  The 1996 RX-7 has
been canceled in North America, but not necessarily the line, though
recent word is grim.  The <A HREF = "rx-01.html">RX-01</A> concept car
is an excellent continuation of Mazda's aggressive and purist approach
to the sports car.

<P> Consider what has been accomplished.  The RCE powered the first
Japanese car to win the <A HREF = "lemans.html">24 Hours of Le Mans</A>.
It has set a world land speed record for its class at 384 kph or 238
mph.  A model RCE has been in production for over 25 years.  The engine
has been adapted to <A HREF = "hydrogen.html">hydrogen</A> fuel and
Diesel operation.  Over one million <A HREF = "rx-7.html">RX-7</A>
sports cars have been produced with rotary combustion engines.

<P> These milestones have been achieved in about one third of the
development time of five major propulsion systems, three of which are
internal combustion piston engines (Figure).  The history is even more
severe since development has mostly been driven by two companies: <A
HREF = "nsu.html">NSU</A> and Mazda, while the dozens of other companies
have almost exclusively focused on piston engines.  Furthermore, the
RCE has been excluded or penalized by most if not all racing bodies,
strangling research and development.

<IMG SRC = "../Images/propuls.gif" WIDTH = 519 HEIGHT = 206>

<P> Four manufacturers currently produce engines (<A HREF =
"mazda.html">Mazda</A>, Moller, <A HREF = "mid-west.html">Mid
West</A>, and <A HREF = "graupner.html">OS/Graupner</A>) that are being
installed in cars, boats, planes, powered lift craft, and toys.  The 5
cc OS/Graupner Wankel model engine holds two distinctions: the smallest,
and the longest in production.  Unfortunately, the first three are in
transient positions.  Mid West is the result of several corporate
resuscitations and reorganizations.  Moller is newly manufacturing
engines.  Mazda is losing money and has to answer more and more to Ford.

<P> What of the future?  The Mazda RX-01 with MSPRE engine is an obvious
candidate to turn into a sports car that I believe would sell well if
the price were reasonable.  Mid West and Moller engines have the
potential to perform well in aircraft applications.

<P> One of the more interesting potentials is the Ultra Low Emissions
Hydrogen RCE.  It provides the best combination of high performance
and low emissions.

<P> Alan Marr.

<P> There are many pages referenced throughout the other pages at this
site, in addition to those here.  Categories are <A HREF =

<H2> <A NAME = "misc"> Miscellaneous (Mostly RX-7) </H2>

<P> <EM> In no particular order. </EM>

<P> <A HREF = "http://www.mazda.co.jp/">Greeting Mazda</A> is the name
of the pages from Mazda Motor Corporation itself in Japan.  As of this
writing, the pages are in Japanese, but English is promised soon.

<P> One of the best sites I have found is the San Francisco <A HREF =
"http://members.aol.com/barx7club/">Bay Area RX-7 Club</A>'s page.  This
page includes the best vendor list I've seen so far.

<P> Australia gives us the <A HREF =
"http://www.vision.net.au/~hirpm/index.html">HiRPM site</A>, which is
one of the more complete available.  Included is valuable information on
<A HREF =
"http://www.vision.net.au/~hirpm/wankel/porting.html">porting</A> Mazda
engines.  Gerhard Geiling, a contributor in German here, wrote for HiRPM
some English language material about <A HREF =
"http://www.vision.net.au/~hirpm/nsu/index.html">NSU Ro80</A>.

<P> Brooks Weisblat has an innovative page that uses image-maps to
explain features of the <A HREF =
"http://bio.fsu.edu/~weisblat/index.html">third generation RX-7</A>.
It was recently updated with action autocross pictures.

<P> Information is available from Michael Boulanger on his <a
HREF = "http://www.iii.net/users/mboulang/mazdarx7/mazdarx7.htm"> Mazda
RX-7 page</a>.

<P> Kane has an extensive gallery that is worth a visit.  Pictures on
view include RX-01s from an Australian perspective, one of which is the <A
HREF = "http://www.hawkesbury.uws.edu.au/~kanef/pictures.htm">Best Curve
in the Road Image</A> I've seen in a while, as well as a good shot that
shows the aerodynamic slot in the front.  You can find early RXs and
a sharp boat.

<P> High in the stakes for best slogan is <A HREF =
"http://www.canuck.com/~dwiles/">No Rotor, No Motor</A>.  There I found
the most extensive continent wide list of <A HREF =
"http://www.canuck.com/~dwiles/classifieds/ads.html">classified ads</A>
of RX-7s for sale and wanted.

<P> More information should be available from the <A HREF =
"ftp://ftp.att.com/pub/rx7/index.html"> RX7Net Home Page </A> but was
not available at this writing.  A correspondent has said new pages
are under construction.

<P> Norway has a page on the <A HREF =
"http://www.stud.his.no/~hegle/mazda.html">Mazda Cosmo RX-5</A> which
consists mostly of specifications.

<P> Dave Disney has a page with images and information on <A HREF =
"http://funnelweb.utcc.utk.edu/~disney/">headers and presilencers</A>.

<P> <A HREF = "http://aruba.ccit.arizona.edu/~rockd/">Dave Rock</A> has
an interesting page with some great photos.  He also has a good page on
the <A HREF = "http://aruba.ccit.arizona.edu/~rockd/brochure.html">79
RX-7</A> featuring the brochure.  It is 1.7 to 2 MB, which is a lot of
data that is worth visiting.  The brochure pages are skillfully scanned.
They are full of detailed cutaway drawings, photos, slogans, and
explanatory copy.  A classic product introduction for their time, I'd
say.

<P> <A HREF = "http://206.99.236.10/~klong/rx7.html">Second Generation
RX-7</A> issues are discussed in this very long page, with particular
attention to fixes for technical problems and performance modifications.
There is a summary list of Technical Service Bulletins.

<P> Theron Muller writes about <A HREF =
"http://www.engg.ksu.edu/KSE/rotary/rotary2.html">Re-Engineering the
Wankel</A>.  It is a reasonable summary of the Wankel, but has a couple
of factual errors such as claiming a compression ratio of 4.  At the end
there is a claim that the rotary engine is prone to dieseling, something
I have not read anywhere else and which is contrary to my own
experience.  One can see the <A HREF =
"http://www.engg.ksu.edu/KSE/rotary/rotframe.html">article formatted by
HTML</A> with a diagram that has gears that don't mesh and a housing
shape that is not epitrochoidal.  The re-engineering reference is to the
RandCam engine, which is not a Wankel.  The RandCam diagram has several
spelling errors.  This appears to have appeared in the "Kansas State
Engineer", V. 81, N. 3, Spring 1996.

<P> <A HREF = "http://www.engin.umd.umich.edu/~maxc/rx7home.html">Max
Cooper</A> discusses the Rotary Combustion cycle and lists some
vendors and other sites.  I especially like the use of the rotor for
the background.

<P> <A HREF =
"http://woodruffn121.residence.gatech.edu/users/Yossarian/WebPages/car.html">Derrick
Whittle</A> has some images including an exploded view of the engine.

<P> <A HREF = "http://www.wieckphoto.com/Auto/MAZDA/">Wieck</A> has some
good photos.

<P> <A HREF = "http://www.primenet.com/~shafted/mazda.htm">Aric Shen</A>
provides a look at a serious enthusiast and an amusing study of frat-boy
attitudes.

<P> There is information about
<A HREF = "http://www.worldtel.com/cajad/manufact/mazda/mazinfo.htm">
Mazda Motor Corporation</A>.

<P> Doug Fortune has a page about experimental <A HREF =
"http://www.cuug.ab.ca:8001/~fortuned/homeop.html">Rotary Engines for
Homebuilt Aircraft</A>.

<P> A Wankel <A HREF =
"http://ed1.eng.ohio-state.edu/Bestof92/WankelEngineStack.sea.hqx">animation
using a HyperCard stack</A> is one of the ITEA Technology Education
Software Bank's Best of 92.

<P> Kevin Wyum has a page with many interesting <A HREF =
"http://www.servtech.com/public/hsm/rx7.html">third generation
pictures</A>.  There is also a page of pictures of <A HREF =
"http://www.servtech.com/public/hsm/KTW.html">modifications</A> to his
car, but he warns that they are not current.  His car was mentioned in
<A HREF = "http://www.turbomagazine.com/march/isra.html">Turbo
Magazine's</A> March 1996 and May 1995 issues as the "World's Fastest
new-generation RX-7".  This car is <A HREF = "http://www.canuck.com/~dwiles/classifieds/ads.html">for sale</A>.

<P> Jeff Littrell sounds a note of <A HREF =
"http://www.bhs.com/fca/mazda/"> caution</A> about 3rd gen. RX-7s,
especially 1993.

<P> RotaryRckt@aol.com has a site with an original title:  <A HREF =
"http://users.aol.com/RotaryRckt/Peri.html">Peritrochoid</A>.  It is
partly constructed.  There is information about a non-standard turbo
and 13B combination.

<H2> <A NAME = "merch"> Merchandise </H2>

<P> Superchips has modifications available for second generation RX-7s
that are <A HREF = "http://www.superchips.com/rx7asp.htm">normally

<H2> <A NAME = "AltAlt"> Alternatives to the Alternative Engine </A> </H2>

<P> The Wankel rotary combustion engine can be considered as the
alternative four phase engine.  Here are some rotary engines other than
Wankels that can be grouped as the <A HREF = "#RandCam">Rand Cam</A> and
<A HREF = "#miscellaneous">miscellaneous</A>.

<P> <STRONG> <A NAME = "RandCam"> Rand Cam </STRONG>

<P> The <A HREF = "http://www.worldtel.com/regtec/">Rand Cam Rotary
Diesel</A> engine is perhaps the main alternative to the Wankel type
RCE.  It uses sliding vanes, but manages to avoid valves.  <A HREF =
"http://www.newswire.ca/releases/April1996/03/c0494.html">Testing begins
in April</A>.  Evaluation and improvements have been contributed by <A
HREF = "http://www.cira.wvu.edu/cur_proj.html">CIRA, W. Virginia
University</A>.  A technical article is referenced through one of the <A
HREF = "http://www.osti.gov/html/eren/3301.html">EREN search pages</A>.

<P> Lockheed Martin is developing a rotary powered <A HREF =
"http://jefferson.vf.mmc.com/extest/ASD_unmanned.html">Unmanned Aerial
Vehicle</A> for tactical reconnaisance.  The page linked in the next
paragraph indicates this might be a Rand-Cam.  The engine will have two
rotors, "large displacement", stratified charge, oil cooling, and will
take heavy fuel (JPG-5 and 8).  The advantages needed are high power to
weight ratio, low vibration at 6000 rpm, and low parts count for
logistic simplicity.

<P> Rand-Cam and Alliant TechSystems propose to power a UAV with <A HREF
= "http://popularmechanics.com/popmech/tech/U095L.html">this engine</A>.

<P> <STRONG> <A NAME = "miscellaneous"> Miscellaneous (alternatives to
the alternative to the alternative engine) </STRONG>

<P> <A NAME = "Thalo"> The site for Thalo is an example of what all
alternative technology sites should be: <A HREF =
"http://www.cerfnet.com/~thalo/">clear and informative</A>.  They do not
attempt to be mysterious like so many other sites.  There are clear
diagrams, detailed explanations, and an animation showing the principle
of operation.  The design uses a four-stroke cycle to drive five pairs
of opposed pistons in an air-cooled frame that rotates.  As of June 1996
they have yet to produce an engine.  The design is also to be applied
to pumps.

<P> <A NAME = "Cir-Com"> The Cir-Com <A HREF = "http://www.circom.com/">
Goodman Circular Rotary Engine</A> was invented by William A. Goodman
who was awarded patent 5,036,809 on Aug. 6, 1991, which he assigned to
Cir-Com Development Corporation.  It seems there is a full scale model
in existence to simulate the engine, and several proposed designs.  The
site does not explain the principles of operation but has several
interesting pictures.  It appears to be a multi-bladed design.  You are
invited to send them money to find out the specifications.  They are
seeking investors.

<P> Oldrich Nos mentions his <A HREF =
"http://www.photobyte.on.ca/photobyte/onos/invent.htm#AUTOMOTIVE">Continuous
Combustion Rotary Engine</A> invention.

<P> Stefan Bakos has invented what he calls the <A HREF =
"http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/invent/engine3.htm">Compulsory
Rotary Engine</A>.  It has US Patent 3,863,611.  He claims it is free
from pollution, its filtered output being water, air and oxygen.
Neither the page nor the image give a clear explanation, so it can't be
determined how it relates to the Wankel engine.  There appear to be four
rotors with three lobes, but the apexes are greatly rounded.  The
picture shows an air intake system reminiscent of the RX-7 Turbo II
intercooler.  It has writing that appears to say 1782 cc.

<P> The <A HREF = "http://zim.com/bmp/rvice">RVICE</A> Rotary Vane
Internal Combustion Engine (RVICE) does not have a working model in
existence, nor even a name of a person on the page to take credit for
the design, though the keywords "Dana Michael Inman" do appear in very
fine print.  By the anonymous inventor's own evaluation it appears to be
similar to an earlier Bancroft design, who did build some prototypes.

<P> <A HREF =  "http://personalwebs.myriad.net/tgunn/engine-2.htm"> Perlex
Inc. Rotary Power Engine</A>.  This is not a Wankel rotary engine but is
instead a variation, rooted in the Ramelli device from Italy, 1588.
This page is simply text, probably a press release about a test on
Nov. 1, 1985.

<P> The Newbold powerplant is said to be a turbo reciprocating
rotating-block engine.  I found out by starting at one of the <A HREF =
"http://www.osti.gov/html/eren/3301.html">EREN search pages</A>.

<P> Koichi Hirata has invented a <A HREF =
"http://www.mech.saitama-u.ac.jp/kiriki/rotary.html">Rotary Displacer
Stirling Engine</A>.

<P> Pangman has invented a rotating vane engine.  I found a reference at
one of the <A HREF = "http://www.osti.gov/html/eren/3301.html">EREN
search pages</A>.

<P> The "something for nothing" folks are at it again.  Hartmann has
resuscitated an article from Popular Mechanics June 1979 that describes
a mis-named "<A HREF = "http://www.overunity.de/wankel.htm">magnetic
wankel motor</A>".  The inspiration for the wankel designation is the
stator that has an air gap that varies from 0.1 mm to 5 mm away from the
circular rotor.  It is claimed to use less current than conventional
motors.  It has no connection to Wankel shapes or principles.

<H2> Marginal or Related Interest </H2>

<P> William Chui has written a few pages about <A HREF =
"http://commando.me.berkeley.edu/~willchui/reuleaux.html">Franz
Reuleaux</A> which are mildly interesting to those with a geometrical
bent, though there is a slight confusion about what constitutes a Wankel
rotary engine (RVICE creeps in).  Also, according to my reading of
Ansdale, the Wankel rotor is not a Reuleaux triangle.

<P>"<A HREF =
"http://www.wri.com/mathematica/books/bookcalcproj.html">Calculus </A>
Projects Using <em>Mathematica</em>", Revised Edition.  Just the table
of contents.  Apparently has a chapter on the Wankel Rotary Engine.

sports cars have been produced with rotary combustion engines.

<P> These milestones have been achieved in about one third of the
development time of five major propulsion systems, three of which are
internal combustion piston engines (Figure).  The history is even more
severe since development has mostly been driven by two companies: <A
HREF = "nsu.html">NSU</A> and Mazda, while the dozens of other companies
have almost exclusively focused on piston engines.  Furthermore, the
RCE has been excluded or penalized by most if not all racing bodies,
strangling research and development.

<IMG SRC = "../Images/propuls.gif" WIDTH = 519 HEIGHT = 206>

<P> Four manufacturers currently produce engines (<A HREF =
"mazda.html">Mazda</A>, Moller, <A HREF = "mid-west.html">Mid
West</A>, and <A HREF = "graupner.html">OS/Graupner</A>) that are being
installed in cars, boats, planes, powered lift craft, and toys.  The 5
cc OS/Graupner Wankel model engine holds two distinctions: the smallest,
and the longest in production.  Unfortunately, the first three are in
transient positions.  Mid West is the result of several corporate
resuscitations and reorganizations.  Moller is newly manufacturing
engines.  Mazda is losing money and has to answer more and more to Ford.

<P> What of the future?  The Mazda RX-01 with MSPRE engine is an obvious
candidate to turn into a sports car that I believe would sell well if
the price were reasonable.  Mid West and Moller engines have the
potential to perform well in aircraft applications.

<P> One of the more interesting potentials is the Ultra Low Emissions
Hydrogen RCE.  It provides the best combination of high performance
and low emissions.

		HEIGHT=99 WIDTH=100 ALT="Dr. Wankel Image">

Felix Wankel was born August 13, 1902 in Lahr in the Black Forest in
Germany, an only child of <A
HREF="http://www.genealogy.com/gastel/0200/fam0284.htm">Rudolf Wankel</A>
(1867-?), a senior forestry official (Grossh. Bad. Oberfoerster)
subsequently killed by schrapnel at Dornach (Elsass (Alsace?)) in World
War I as an Oberleutnant, and <A
HREF="http://www.genealogy.com/gastel/0200/fam0283.htm">Martha Gertrud
Heidlauff</A> (1879-?).  Dr. Wankel passed away on October 9, 1988,
Lindau, W. Germany, where he did much of his research and where
Wankel R&D is located.

<P> Wankel left school at the age of 19, but he gained academic
recognition within his own time when he was awarded an honorary
doctorate degree from Technische Universit&auml;t M&uuml;nchen in 1969.
His first job was apprenticing in sales for a publisher in Heidelberg,
but he devoted his energy to tinkering, especially after losing the
sales job in 1924.

<P> Wankel's first attempt to receive a patent was in 1926 for a "grease
turbine", but it was predated by an Enke design from 1886.  In 1933 he
applied for a patent for a <A HREF="rce.html#DKM">DKM</A> engine, which
he received in 1936.

<P> In the following years, Wankel mostly made his way by ingenious work
on rotary valves and sealing technology for BMW, DVL, Junker, and
Daimler-Benz.  During this time he developed various DKM prototypes and
also rotary pumps and compressors.

<P> After the end of the war in 1945 his development was interrupted,
but by 1951 he interested NSU in development.  This lead to
collaboration with Walter Froede, head of the motorcycle racing program,
who would ultimately make the decision to adopt the <A
HREF="rce.html#KKM">KKM</A> type.

<P> The first truly functional Wankel rotary engine was a DKM type that
ran in February 1957.  By May a prototype was able to run for two hours
and produce 21 bhp.  The first KKM engine ran on July 7, 1958.

<P> There are Felix-Wankel-Strasse streets in Heilbronn, Dachau, and
Neckarsulm, all in Germany.

<P> Dr. Wankel had a strong impulse towards animal welfare.  <A HREF =

<CENTER><H1> Some RCE Vehicle Production and Sales Numbers </H1></CENTER>

<P> In 1973, Mazda sold 104,960 cars in the US, twice the previous
year's total.  More than 92 percent had rotary engines.


<P> A total of 474,565 first generation RX-7 were produced (from X605
through P132) from 1978 through July 1985.  Almost 80 % or 377,878 were
exported to the US.  By 1990, a million RX-7s had been produced.

<P> I spoke with someone at Mazda last year and was given the total 
production #'s for the 93 intro year of approx. 20,000 worldwide.
Of the 20,000 93 RX7's 1,800 R1 packages were produced worldwide.

<P> Is the figure that was posted accurate only 5,000 odd rx7's sold in the 
U.S. of the 93 model year. WOW, that means approximately 550 R1's in the 
US. cool that could make it worth some money in the not too distant future.
I don't remember which one but some magazine recently published a list of 
cars likely to be collectors items in the future. The 93 RX7 was one of 
them, one of the only Japanese cars to potentialy increase in value, the 
numbers explain why.

<P> Kevin T. Wyum<BR> 93 RX7-R1

<HR>

The Japan Times reported on Feb. 20, 1996 that production of the RX-7
totaled 5,200 units in 1995, and an additional 330 rotary Eunos Cosmos
were produced.

1996)</EM>

<P> <FONT SIZE=+2>M</FONT>azda <FONT SIZE=+2>M</FONT>otor Corp. denied a
newspaper report Feb. 20 that said the automaker may stop production of
its rotary engine, a trademark technological feature.  Hiroshima-based
<A HREF="mazda.html">Mazda</A> is the only automaker in the world to
mass-produce rotary engines, which are more compact and high-powered
than piston engines but have high fuel consumption.

<P> Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported that Mazda is studying the possibility
of halting production of the engine, quoting remarks by Ronald Leicht,

<P> Mazda Motor Corp. may stop producing rotary engines, Vice President
Ronald Leicht, who is responsible for domestic sales, has told The Nihon

engines.  Leicht implied that Mazda will stop production unless
prospects improve for sales of the RX-7 sports car, which is equipped
with rotary engines.

<P> However, only consumers can decide the fate of the engines, Leicht
said.

<P> Stopping production is expected to reduce annual expenses by several
billion yen, with over 50 workers engaged in development and design
reassigned elsewhere.

<P> Mazda, which set up a marketing headquarters in January, will make a
final decision this year following the reconsolidation of its sports car
business with Ford Motor Co., a top Mazda shareholder.

<H2> Wallace Vows to Build Mazda, Maintain Identity </H2>

<EM> Reported on RX-7 mail list May 10, 1996 </EM>

<P> TOKYO (Reuter) - Henry Wallace, who will become the first
foreigner to head a major Japanese corporation, vowed Thursday
to turn around troubled Mazda Motor Corp. while keeping it
independent of its American big brother, Ford Motor Co.

<P> The Ford executive, who will takeover as Mazda's president
next month, said Ford was not aiming to swallow up the Japanese
firm and wanted to maintain Mazda's separate identity. The two
firms have a long-standing relationship.

<P> ``It is not a strategy (to let Mazda disappear). It is a
strategy to build Mazda,'' Wallace, who was brought in by Ford
two years ago to help run financially troubled Mazda, told a
news conference.

<P> Hiroshima-based Mazda has been struggling to overcome slow exports
due to the strong yen and poor domestic sales. Ford announced last month
that it would increase its equity investment in Mazda in a deal under
which Wallace, currently executive vice president at Mazda, will take
the helm of Japan's fifth largest carmaker in June.  The equity deal
gave Mazda a 52.31 billion yen ($498 million) capital infusion and
raised Ford's stake to one-third from one-quarter.  Mazda has forecast
nil net profit for the year that ended March 31 after reporting parent
net losses of almost 80 billion yen ($761 million) in the two years
before that.

<P> Wallace said earnings details and the forecast for the current year
would be released next week, when the company issues its financial
statement.  He said Mazda was making progress toward profitability by
cost-cutting and restructuring, but that it still had a long way to go
before achieving its profit goals.  "I think we are making progress,"
he said, but added: "We are at a threshold ... We have a long time to
go before we would be at a (profit) level I would be comfortable with."

<P> Wallace said both Mazda and Ford could benefit from various
synergies, such as in sales and distribution or in eliminating
duplication.  ``But frankly, we haven't sat down with Ford to talk with
them,'' he added.  He said there would be a quarterly meeting at the end
of this month, but added that he did not expect any major decisions on
the synergies.

<P> Wallace said Mazda would focus on building up its Japanese business
and put more of an emphasis on production overseas.  The company also
would continue to strengthen its business in North America, Europe, Asia
and Latin America.

<H1> O&#249; Ira Wankel? </H1>

<P> <EM> 25 Mai, 1996 </EM>

<P> Nous se trouvons &#224; point de flexion dans la journ&#233;e de
Moteur Rotatoire &#224; Combustion (<A HREF = "rce.html">MRC</A>).  La
RX-7 de 1996 pour Am&#233;rique du Nord a &#233;t&#233; cancel&#233;.
Le reportage n'est pas optimiste.  Le v&#233;hicule conceptuelle <A HREF
= "rx-01.html">RX-01</A> continu&#233; l'approach pure et aggressif de
Mazda au voiture sportif.

<P> R&#233;fl&#233;chissons sur les accomplissements.  Le MRC a
gagn&#233; le <A HREF = "lemans.html">24 Heures Du Mans</A>.  Il a
faites un record mondiale de 384 kph.  Un mod&#232;le MRC a
&#233;t&#233; fabriqu&#233; pour plus que 25 ann&#233;es.  Le moteur a
&#233;t&#233; adapt&#233; au gaz <A HREF =
"hydrogen.html">hydrog&#232;ne</A> et la mode Diesel.  Plus qu' un
million de voitures sportif <A HREF = "rx-7.html">RX-7</A> a
&#233;t&#233; manufacture avec les moteurs rotatoire &#224; combustion.

<P> Ces accomplissements a &#233;t&#233; accompli en circa un troisieme
de temps de d&#233;veloppement des systemes majeur de propulsion (trois
sont moteurs &#224; combustion internal avec piston).  R&#233;gardez la
figure.  L' histoire est m&#234;me plus s&#233;v&#232;re parce que la
d&#233;veloppement a &#233;t&#233; faites par deux companies pour la
plus part: <A HREF = "nsu.html">NSU</A> et Mazda, quand les douzens d'
autres companies a concentr&#233; exclusivement sur les moteurs piston.
De plus, les moteurs rotatoire a &#234;tre exclu&#233; ou penalis&#233;.
Ca a l'effet d' &#233;trangl&#233; la r&#233;cherche et
d&#233;veloppement.

<IMG SRC = "../Images/propuls.gif" WIDTH = 519 HEIGHT = 206>

<P> Quatre companies faites moteurs maintenant: <A HREF =
"mazda.html">Mazda</A>, Moller, <A HREF = "mid-west.html">Mid
West</A>, and <A HREF = "graupner.html">OS/Graupner</A>.  Ils sont
install&#233;e en voitures, bateaux, avions, et jouets.  The 5 cc
OS/Graupner Wankel moteur mod&#232;le est la plus petits et la plus long
de production.  Malheureusement, les trois premiers se trovent dans
situations transitoire.  Mid West est nouvellement revenir &#224; la
vie.  Moller a commenc&#233;e fabriquer moteurs.  Mazda perd monnaie et
dois repondre plus en plus &#224; Ford.

<P> Quelle avenir?  La Mazda RX-01 avec MSPRE moteur est un candidate
fort pour tourn&#233; &#224; voiture sportif que je crois veux vende
bien si la prix etais raisonable.  Mid West et Moller a la potential de
performer bien en avions.

<P> Un des plus interessant potentials est le MRC Hydrogen pour
Extrem&#234;ment Bas &#201;missions.  Ils faits la plus belles
combinaison de haute performance et bas &#233;missions.

<P> Alan Marr.

<CENTER> <H2> L'Opinion </H2> </CENTER>

<H1> O&#249; Ira Wankel? </H1>

<P> <EM> 25 Mai, 1996 </EM>

<P> Nous se trouvons &#224; point de flexion dans la journ&#233;e de
Moteur Rotatoire &#224; Combustion (<A HREF = "rce.html">MRC</A>).  La
RX-7 de 1996 pour Am&#233;rique du Nord a &#233;t&#233; cancel&#233;.
Le reportage n'est pas optimiste.  Le v&#233;hicule conceptuelle <A HREF
= "rx-01.html">RX-01</A> continu&#233; l'approach pure et aggressif de
Mazda au voiture sportif.

<P> R&#233;fl&#233;chissons sur les accomplissements.  Le MRC a
gagn&#233; le <A HREF = "lemans.html">24 Heures Du Mans</A>.  Il a
faites un record mondiale de 384 kph.  Un mod&#232;le MRC a
&#233;t&#233; fabriqu&#233; pour plus que 25 ann&#233;es.  Le moteur a
&#233;t&#233; adapt&#233; au gaz <A HREF =
"hydrogen.html">hydrog&#232;ne</A> et la mode Diesel.  Plus qu' un
million de voitures sportif <A HREF = "rx-7.html">RX-7</A> a
&#233;t&#233; manufacture avec les moteurs rotatoire &#224; combustion.

<P> Ces accomplissements a &#233;t&#233; accompli en circa un troisieme
de temps de d&#233;veloppement des systemes majeur de propulsion (trois
sont moteurs &#224; combustion internal avec piston).  R&#233;gardez la
figure.  L' histoire est m&#234;me plus s&#233;v&#232;re parce que la
d&#233;veloppement a &#233;t&#233; faites par deux companies pour la
plus part: <A HREF = "nsu.html">NSU</A> et Mazda, quand les douzens d'
autres companies a concentr&#233; exclusivement sur les moteurs piston.
De plus, les moteurs rotatoire a &#234;tre exclu&#233; ou penalis&#233;.
Ca a l'effet d' &#233;trangl&#233; la r&#233;cherche et
d&#233;veloppement.

<IMG SRC = "../Images/propuls.gif" WIDTH = 519 HEIGHT = 206>

<P> Quatre companies faites moteurs maintenant: <A HREF =
"mazda.html">Mazda</A>, Moller, <A HREF = "mid-west.html">Mid
West</A>, and <A HREF = "graupner.html">OS/Graupner</A>.  Ils sont
install&#233;e en voitures, bateaux, avions, et jouets.  The 5 cc
OS/Graupner Wankel moteur mod&#232;le est la plus petits et la plus long
de production.  Malheureusement, les trois premiers se trovent dans
situations transitoire.  Mid West est nouvellement revenir &#224; la
vie.  Moller a commenc&#233;e fabriquer moteurs.  Mazda perd monnaie et
dois repondre plus en plus &#224; Ford.

<P> Quelle avenir?  La Mazda RX-01 avec MSPRE moteur est un candidate
fort pour tourn&#233; &#224; voiture sportif que je crois veux vende
bien si la prix etais raisonable.  Mid West et Moller a la potential de
performer bien en avions.

<P> Un des plus interessant potentials est le MRC Hydrogen pour
Extrem&#234;ment Bas &#201;missions.  Ils faits la plus belles
combinaison de haute performance et bas &#233;missions.

<P> Alan Marr.

<P> Je souhait quelqu'un peut perfectionne mon traduction.

        Early Intervention</strong></a> </p>
        <p>The diagnosis of an infant's deafness is a most
        painful time for parents, but also the time of greatest
        hope. The earlier a child's residual hearing is
        stimulated by speech, the faster and further language
        will progress. </p>
        <p>This is why St. Joseph's offers a specialized early
        intervention Parent-Child program. As we support and
        counsel parents in coping with their child's diagnosis,
        we also guide them in their role as the child's first and
        most important teachers of language. </p>
        <p>For toddlers up to approximately age 2 1/2, parents
        and child together attend individual one-hour sessions
        one or more times a week. Through social, motor and
        cognitive activities, parents learn to assist in
        developing their child's auditory/verbal skills in the
        home. </p>
        <p>&#160; </p>
        <p><a name="Nursery Class"><strong>Nursery Class</strong></a> </p>
        <p>A three morning a week nursery class offers children
        ages 2 1/2 to 3 1/2 a fun and effective combination of
        activities to stimulate their development. In small
        classes, they develop group interaction experiences while
        enjoying age appropriate activities. Part of the day
        includes individual speech and listening therapy for each
        child. </p>
        <p>&#160; </p>
        <p><a name="Preschool"><strong>Preschool</strong></a> </p>
        <p>Academic , language and developmental class activities
        of an age-appropriate level are conducted in a full-day,
        five day a week preschool program. The preschool
        generally enrolls children between the ages of 3 1/2 and
        5. Inclusion of children slightly younger or older is
        considered, based upon individual evaluations. </p>
        <p>As socialization, motor and cognitive skills continue
        to develop, the children advance into a more concentrated
        academic and speech program. The curriculum is designed
        to prepare them for kindergarten and primary classrooms,
        either in the mainstream or in a dedicated deaf-education
        setting. </p>

        <p>Educational and speech rehabilitation therapy is
        offered on an individual basis for cochlear implanted
        children of all grade school ages. As a pioneer in the
        development of post-implant language therapy, St.
        Joseph's program offers a level of expertise and
        experience unsurpassed in the nation. </p>
        <p>Through phonetic discrimination and auditory
        comprehension drills, therapists teach implanted students
        how to decode newly available sounds and translate them
        into improved speech and language. </p>
        <p>Private therapy sessions of one-half hour to an hour
        are offered by appointment during regular hours or after
        school. </p>

        <h2>Information </h2>
        <h3>Mission Statement </h3>
        <p>St. Joseph Institute for the Deaf is committed to the
        auditory/oral education, spiritual and emotional growth,
        and personal development of hearing impaired children and
        young adults. We -- as faculty, board management and
        support personnel -- work together to give the gift of
        spoken language to those who would otherwise not know it. </p>
        <p>The Institute's teaching resources are first applied
        in the earliest stages of language development, always in
        a teaching partnership with parents. Preschool and
        primary programs combine general education with an
        intensive program for language development. A residential
        option attracts students from communities across the
        nation where no age-appropriate auditory/oral programs
        exist. </p>
        <p>Since we seek to have our students effectively
        mainstreamed into society, our formal curriculum
        concludes at the end of the eighth grade. Continuing
        educational guidance and family and child support
        programs extend through the high school and college
        years. </p>
        <p>St. Joseph Institute's 158 year history and
        international reputation impose obligations of continued
        leadership: an involvement in educational research, the
        prudent incorporation of biomedical and technical
        advances and the professional development of educators of
        the deaf. </p>
        <p>The Institute's environment combines familial warmth
        with assured professionalism. While our work is
        ecumenical, we bring to it a distinctive Catholic spirit,
        reflecting the values and traditions of the Sisters of
        St. Joseph of Carondelet. These values are evident in our
        commitment &quot;to serve those who would otherwise be
        unserved.&quot; To this mission we dedicate our energies
        and those resources which our benefactors generously
        provide. </p>

        <h2>Information </h2>
        <h3>An Overview </h3>
        <p>St. Joseph Institute for the Deaf is dedicated to one
        remarkable work: teaching hearing impaired children to
        listen and to speak. </p>
        <p>The Schools success is just as remarkable -- 97% of
        its graduates go on to mainstream high schools and 93%
        attend college. Many earn graduate and professional
        degrees. One is on the White House staff. </p>
        <p>Yet, numbers alone cannot measure the help, the hope
        and the happiness that St. Joseph's has given to
        generations of children and their parents. There is a
        singular, proud theme to St. Joseph 's 150-year history:
        doing one thing uncommonly well, with dedication and
        love. </p>
        <p>In 1837, two Sisters of St. Joseph came to frontier
        St. Louis from Lyon, France at the request of Bishop
        Joseph Rosati. They came to open a log cabin school for
        &quot;the education of mutes.&quot; It became the first
        school for deaf children west of the Mississippi. </p>
        <p>The Sisters devoted their lives to this work without
        fully realizing that St. Joseph's would achieve the
        international recognition the School enjoys today. They
        responded to a call to serve, that hearing impaired
        children might be able to hear and answer their own calls
        to happiness. </p>
        <p>In 1934, St. Joseph's took a bold step, forsaking the
        manual communication of the day to embrace the
        auditory/oral philosophy it has championed to this day.
        Today, St. Joseph's faculty is a diverse, highly trained
        and broadly experienced group of educators. But they are
        no less committed to the Institute's historic mission. </p>
        <p>St. Joseph's is one of only three auditory/oral
        schools in the U.S. offering a residency option. The
        School has attracted students from over 40 states and
        many foreign countries. Dozens of families move to St.
        Louis to enroll children in the School. In addition to
        the superb education, there is the home-like setting of a
        10-acre suburban campus and the personal concern of the
        Institute's faculty and staff. </p>
        <p>A private, non-profit school, St. Joseph's is open to
        all children without regard to race, religion, sex or the
        family's ability to pay. Financial aid is available to
        all who evidence need. </p>
        <p>St. Joseph's continues to break new ground in the
        advancement of deaf education. In the early 1980's it
        became a pioneer in early intervention of hearing
        impaired infants with the opening of a formative speech
        center that teaches parents how to be their child's first
        teachers of language. </p>
        <p>In 1983, the Institute came to the forefront again
        with its cochlear implant rehabilitation program, now the
        nation's largest. Over the past decade, St. Joseph's has
        responded to this biotechnical breakthrough with
        educational services designed specifically for implanted
        students. </p>
        <p>The School is actively involved in educational
        research. It was selected as the primary participant in a
        multi-year Indiana University study of speech improvement
        in cochlear implanted children. </p>
        <p>St. Joseph's is a teacher of teachers. The Institute
        serves as a practicum center for up to 50 undergraduate
        teachers of the deaf, speech pathology and audiology
        students each year. Professional educators from such
        countries as Italy, Argentina, Canada, and Australia
        regularly visit the School to study its methods. </p>
        <p>Although proud of these contributions to research and
        training, St. Joseph's is, first and foremost, a school
        that teaches deaf children. It is not, however, a school
        for deafness. Its model programs exist to help hearing
        impaired children become self-determining adults who will
        have a voice in their future. </p>

        <h2>Information </h2>
        <h3>Molloy Parent-Child Center </h3>
        <p>One out of every 400 babies born in the United States
        suffers a significant hearing loss. Often, medical
        science cannot identify the cause of deafness, let alone
        prevent or cure it. </p>
        <p>The diagnosis of a child's deafness is a most painful
        time for parents, but also the time of greatest hope. The
        earlier a child's residual hearing is stimulated by
        speech, the faster and further language skills progress. </p>
        <p>That is why, in 1981, St. Joseph Institute for the
        Deaf established its Molloy Parent-Child Center. The
        Center works exclusively with young children from birth
        to five years of age, offering formative language therapy
        in the auditory/oral philosophy. The Center also helps
        hearing children who have delayed speech and language. </p>
        <p>But this is truly a parent-child program. Parents are
        supported and counseled as they cope with the normal
        range of emotions and demands accompanying their child's
        diagnosis. The Center's staff instructs parents in their
        role as the child's first and most important teachers of
        language. </p>
        <p>For toddlers up to age three, parents and children
        attend weekly one-hour sessions together in the Molloy
        Center. Parents learn to assist the child in developing
        auditory-verbal communication skills through social,
        motor and cognitive activities which the parents can
        continue at home. Additional sessions are conducted with
        the child and therapist to reinforce and expand the
        language growth. </p>
        <p>Children ages two to three attend the Center's Nursery
        program in very small groups or private sessions to
        receive age-appropriate therapy. SJI's pediatric
        audiological services are available to all Molly Center
        children. </p>
        <p>Molly's setting is distinct and purposeful. In a
        quaint stone cottage on the wooded campus of St.
        Joseph's, the Center is a small replica of a home,
        featuring a kitchen, bedroom and family room. This warm,
        home-like setting is comforting to children and parents
        alike. But it also serves an important learning function
        by allowing the infants to associate concepts and sounds
        with the object and environment of their homes. </p>
        <p>The Molloy Center has helped more than 500 children
        and their parents lay the early, critical foundation for
        future listening and speaking skills. How important can
        this type of program be to a child? </p>
        <p>In 1993, the National Institutes of Health determined
        that early detection of a hearing loss and immediate
        language therapy such as that offered by the Molloy
        Center can: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>increase the child's high school reading level by
                four grades, and</li>
            <li>increase the student's lifetime earning power by
                as much as $800,000.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Molloy Parent-Child Center was founded by Sr.
        Arline Eveld, M.Ed., P.Dipl., who, in developing this
        model program, drew upon her 30 years of training and
        experience in deaf education and the Institute's 150
        years of success in helping deaf children. </p>
        <p>The Molloy Center annually provides evaluation and
        referral services to hundreds of parents throughout the
        nation, assisting them in identifying the professional

        <h2>Information </h2>
        <h3>Educational &amp; Language Development with
        Audiological Support </h3>
        <p>The academic program provides a pre- and elementary
        school curriculum, in combination with auditory/oral
        training, for profoundly hearing impaired children age
        three through eighth grade. </p>
        <p>The academic goal of the School is to move students
        into mainstream schools at the earliest appropriate age. </p>
        <p>However, instilling the gifts of listening and spoken
        language, which give our students an opportunity to reach
        their full academic, social and personal potential, is
        the true hallmark of St. Joseph's. </p>
        <p>Strong moral development is another component of this
        education. Proper judgment, conduct and appearance, and
        the values which guide them, are taught to the children
        and reflected in the staff. </p>
        <p>The &quot;culture&quot; at St. Joseph's is a balance
        of hard challenges and soft hearts. The School sets high
        expectations for its students and does everything it can
        to help each child achieve them. St. Joseph's is not
        content for its graduates to cope. They are encouraged to
        excel. These students meet any measure of success
        including, most importantly, their own. </p>
        <p>These accomplishments come gradually. The
        auditory/oral approach requires intense work over a long
        period. Students are given curricula designed to their
        individual needs. They are also given a lot of personal
        attention: the student/teacher ration is 3:1. </p>
        <p>The teaching of listening and speech never stops at
        St. Joseph's, regardless of time, place or situation. All
        faculty and staff encourage the children to constantly
        use oral communication. Formal speech therapy is
        conducted daily in one-on-one sessions, in reading class,
        in cochlear rehabilitation for implanted students, and in
        all general education courses. </p>
        <p>The academic program is organized into three
        departments: primary, middle and upper schools, which are
        equivalent to a mainstream school's grades K-1, 2-4 and
        5-8 respectively. </p>
        <p>Middle and upper school operate on the departmental
        schedule. All students take a full complement of
        mainstream courses taught by trained educators of the
        deaf with specialties in these academic subjects. </p>
        <p>This well-rounded curriculum includes computer class,
        science lab, art, cognitive development, library/media
        center periods, physical education and field trips. </p>
        <p>A complete pediatric audiology department on-site
        ensures that the children have the highest quality
        technical assistance. The audiology department conducts
        diagnostic testing of each child's hearing level on a
        regular basis and calibrates the students' personal
        hearing devices as well as the School's FM systems to
        maintain their optimum operation levels. </p>
        <p>SJI's education offers deaf children what other
        children have, with one nice exception. Our students
        don't get in trouble when talking in class. </p>

        <h3>Cochlear Implant Rehabilitation </h3>
        <p>St. Joseph's is among the nation's preeminent centers
        for cochlear implant rehabilitation. A dedicated program,
        under the direction of therapy specialists, has attracted
        more implanted students to SJI than any other school in
        America. </p>
        <p>The cochlear implant is the most advanced technology
        designed to transmit sound for profoundly hearing
        impaired persons. But without post-implant therapy, a
        child reaps only partial benefit from the device because
        it merely makes new sounds available. The child must be
        taught how to decode these new sounds and translate them
        into improved speech and language. </p>
        <p>A cochlear implant bypasses the damaged inner ear by
        means of a multi-channel electrode that provides auditory
        information directly to the brain. Not all hearing
        impaired children would benefit from an implant. St.
        Joseph's speech therapists and audiologists play a
        critical role in evaluating a child's candidacy for one. </p>
        <p>For those students who are candidates, a cochlear
        implant, along with therapy, offers the potential to
        significantly advance their language ability, and with
        it, their quality of life. </p>
        <p>Having counseled an increasing number of implanted
        students during the 1980's. the institute committed its
        resources to a formal rehabilitation program in 1987. </p>
        <p>At that time, it enrolled four implanted students.
        This number doubled each of the next several years until
        currently one-third of SJI's student body has cochlear
        implants. </p>
        <p>All implanted students meet individually with the
        director of the rehabilitation program for one half hour,
        every day of the school year, for up to three years.
        Through phonetic discrimination and auditory
        comprehension drills, the students learn to decode the
        new sounds and use them in speech formation. This is in
        addition to the speech and auditory training they receive
        in their other classes. </p>
        <p>The audiology department closely monitors the mapping
        of the implant as the child first gets used to new sounds
        and then becomes increasingly capable of processing them. </p>
        <p>The Institute maintains a strong professional
        relationship with a number of the nation's leading
        cochlear implant surgical teams. It is committed to
        remaining at the fore front of new technology benefiting
        hearing impaired children </p>

        <h2>Information </h2>
        <h3>Students Entering the Mainstream </h3>
        <p>The Institute's primary academic goal is to develop in
        students the auditory/oral skills that will enable them
        to successfully continue their education in a mainstream
        school. </p>
        <p>The Institute not only maintains a 97% rate of success
        in achieving this goal, it is doing it quicker. Eighth
        grade graduations which featured 20 or more students in
        the past, have more recently been held for single-digit
        graduating classes. This is a result of more students
        mainstreaming at earlier ages. </p>
        <p>While individual students still reach this goal at
        different stages, ranging from kindergarten to eighth
        grade, all of them do it with the help of the mainstream
        program. To prepare a student for this climb up the
        educational ladder, the mainstream program provides a
        transitional period, helping to ensure that the eventual
        move is a successful one. </p>
        <p>Students enter the program when they are judged by
        their parents, teachers, principal and staff psychologist
        to be one to two years away from full-time inclusion.
        Over this one- to two- year period, the student spends
        half of the day at SJI, then is accompanied by the
        program coordinator to and from the mainstream school for
        a half day of classes. </p>
        <p>The coordinator meets with each student's mainstream
        teacher in advance to review the child's profile,
        abilities, interests and academic record. The student's
        individual curriculum is divided between the schools to
        avoid subject duplication while assuring a fully-rounded
        education. Course work at St. Joseph's continues to
        include speech therapy. </p>
        <p>The experience at the new school becomes the student's
        first formal use of auditory/oral training outside the
        environs of St. Joseph's. This experience involves a
        balance of academic and social inclusion since the
        student participates fully in all activities at the
        mainstream school. </p>
        <p>The program coordinator, psychologist, teachers and
        principal regularly evaluate each child's adjustment,
        academic and social. These evaluations, which include
        input from the mainstream teacher and the students
        themselves, are shared with the parents. All factors are
        weighed in determining the pace toward eventual full
        mainstreaming. </p>
        <p>Their success in this mainstream transition provides
        students the foundation to relate to a broader world in
        which they will meet their challenges and achievements. </p>

        <h3 align="left">Residential Life </h3>
        <p align="left">Children come from all over the country
        to attend St. Joseph Institute. </p>
        <p align="left">St. Joseph's is one of only three schools
        of its type in the United States offering an on-campus
        residency program for its students, making it possible
        for them to receive the quality of auditory/oral
        education that isn't available in their home communities. </p>
        <p align="left">While the decision to board a youngster
        is a difficult one, more than 30 children from 15 states
        and several foreign countries are enrolled at SJI as
        resident students by their parents. The auditory/oral
        education is seen as that important, and that good. The
        residency program can't replace a child's real home, but
        it has earned the confidence of these parents. </p>
        <p align="left">Four dormitory wings spread across the
        10-acre tree-shaded campus in the suburbs of St. Louis.
        Separate units house younger children, older boys, and
        older girls, along with the full- and part-time staff who
        care for them. These living units are connected with the
        rest of the School to improve ease of movement,
        supervision and safety. </p>
        <p align="left">Normally, two children share a room which
        is brightly, comfortably, but not completely furnished.
        The children add the finishing touches and put their own
        &quot;posterized&quot; stamp of identity on their rooms. </p>
        <p align="left">The children have use of TV and rec.
        rooms, a gymnasium, two playgrounds, a soccer field and
        room to run. All meals are prepared and served in a
        dining room that echoes with the sound of children's
        voices at every meal (and snack time). </p>
        <p align="left">Child care staff must have, as
        prerequisites, strong character and sensitivity to the
        children's needs. Upon these personal traits, St.
        Joseph's develops its staff through daily in-service
        training in child care, child development, first aid,
        speech and language development, and supervisory
        procedures. This staff, along with a nurse, provides
        round the clock supervision. </p>
        <p align="left">Resident life at SJI includes study time
        and tutoring, balanced by plenty of organized and
        unstructured leisure time. At all times, the children are
        encouraged by house parents to practice auditory/oral
        skills. This continuity of communication reinforces what
        is learned in the classroom. </p>
        <p align="left">There is other informal teaching which
        the staff imparts. Good grooming, table manners, proper
        public behavior and other qualities children need to be
        taught are addressed in an ordered but loving
        environment. </p>
        <p align="left">The staff uses individual care plans to
        address each child's special needs. These plans are
        written with input from parents and teachers. They note
        the child's strengths, weaknesses, special interests,
        medical or dietary needs, personality, study habits and
        more. </p>
        <p align="left">The residence program is a reflection of
        the Sisters of St. Joseph's call &quot;to serve those who
        would otherwise be unserved.&quot; It also demonstrates
        the national distinction which the Institute long ago
        earned and so consistently maintains. </p>

        <h2>Information </h2>
        <h3>Co-Curricular Program </h3>
        <p>Healthy, fun after school activities are good for all
        children. To deaf children, they can mean much more. </p>
        <p>For deaf children to prosper in the broader world,
        they need more than the academic and communication skills
        described thus far. Developing other interests and
        talents, important to any child, particularly helps with
        a deaf child's transition to the mainstream. </p>
        <p>St. Joseph's broadens its students' lives with a
        diverse co-curricular program of after school activities.
        These activities offer youngsters exercise, develop new
        interests, stimulate creativity and provide an important
        release from an intense day at school. </p>
        <p>The program is open to all students, providing an
        extra opportunity for day and resident students to
        interact outside of class. It also offers a quality
        after-care option to working parents. </p>
        <p>The activities contained in the program include clubs,
        sports, and hobbies. </p>
        <h4>Clubs </h4>
        <p>Boy Scout and Girl Scout programs for all ages are
        conducted throughout the school year. They offer the
        traditional Scouting activities, in meetings and off
        campus events. In the Mission Club, upper school students
        gain awareness of the needs of others in the community,
        and they plan activities and fund-raisers to reach out
        and help their neighbors. The Drama Club offers creative
        expression in mime, make up, acting, improvisation and
        monologues, all culminating in a Spring performance. </p>
        <h4>Sports </h4>
        <p>Youngsters have the opportunity to play a variety of
        sports on organized teams and/or in their own backyard or
        gym. SJI students participate in soccer, volleyball,
        basketball and track leagues. In many cases, they play on
        or against teams which have both hearing and deaf
        children. Individual sports such as golf, tennis,
        swimming and ice skating are also part of the program. </p>
        <h4>Hobbies </h4>
        <p>Trained volunteers and staff lead or teach activities
        such as dance, music, art, magic, aerobics, gardening,
        collecting and martial arts. </p>

        <h2>Information </h2>
        <h3>Administration, Faculty and Staff </h3>
        <p>In early 1993, the Institute's Board of Directors
        completed an integrated Long Range Plan to establish St.
        Joseph's as the nation's leading auditory/oral school for
        hearing impaired children. </p>
        <p>Guided by this plan and managing from our mission,
        Institute President Michael Keller and St. Joseph's
        management team are advancing that vision for the
        betterment of our children. </p>
        <p>The school program is under the direction of Sister
        Joyce Buckler, Principal for the past 39 years has made

<A NAME="intro"><H3>INTRODUCTION:</H3>

<ul>

In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) is a procedure which offers hope to couples who otherwise are unable to conceive.  Tens of thousands of healthy children have been born worldwide as a result of IVF.  Nevertheless, it is important for all couples considering IVF to fully understand the process as well  as its limitations.<BR>

<BR>


This document is meant to provide the relevant
information concerning our In Vitro Fertilization
(IVF) Program. We hope the pamphlet will
answer most of your questions. If you require
further clarification please contact the GOAL
<a href="staff.htm">Program staff</a> (telephone (613) 761-4100, Fax (613)
724-4942, email <a href="mailto:pclaman@civich.otttawa.on.ca">pclaman@civich.otttawa.on.ca</a>).<BR>

<A NAME="view"><H3>OVERVIEW OF IVF:</H3>

<ul>

In order for a pregnancy to occur, an egg has to be released from the ovary and unite with a sperm.  Normally this union, called fertilization, occurs within the fallopian tube, an organ which joins the uterus (womb) to the ovary.  However, during the process of IVF this union occurs in a laboratory after both eggs and sperm have been collected.  The fertilized eggs are then transferred to the uterus to continue growth.  
<p>
There are six major steps in the in vitro fertilization process.  All of these are done on an out-patient basis:<BR>

<BR>

<ol><li>Stimulation and monitoring of the development of ripening egg(s) in the woman's ovaries.<BR>

<BR>

<li>Collection of the eggs.<BR>

<BR>

<li>Collection and preparation of the sperm sample (ejaculate).<BR>

<BR>

<li>Incubation of the egg(s) and sperm together in
the laboratory, to allow for fertilization and early
embryo growth. If the sperm are of poor quality,
fertilization is facilitated by injection of sperm
into egg using micro manipulation techniques
(<a href="icsi.htm">ICSI</a>).
<p>

<li>Transfer of the embryo(s) into the uterus.

<p>

<li>A two-week wait for a pregnancy or menstruation.

<A NAME="stages"><H3>IVF STAGES IN DETAIL:</H3>



<UL>
<A NAME="eggdevelop"><B><I>Stimulation of Egg Development:</I></B><BR>

<BR>

Fertility drugs are given to control the timing of egg ripening and to increase the chance of collecting more than one egg.  At the GOAL Program, we will generally employ a combination of drugs to induce the growth of multiple egg follicles.  This process is called "super-ovulation".<BR>

<BR>

The drugs most commonly used, GnRH agonists and menotropins are taken by daily injection.  GnRH agonists are a medication used to "switch off"  the patient's own hormone signals in order to prevent them from interfering with the super-ovulation process.  Menotropins are a medication which consists of the natural follicle stimulation hormone (FSH) that stimulate the ovary to produce egg containing follicles.  IVF nurses will teach you to administer some of the medication yourself by injection or nasally spray. <BR> 

<BR>

Soon after menotropins treatment has started, the growth of these follicles must be monitored carefully by daily blood hormone levels and ultrasound testing.  The daily blood tests will be used to monitor Estrogen levels (a hormone produced by the follicle) and commence at menotropins Day 4 or 5.  Ultrasound (a diagnostic procedure which uses sound waves to produce pictures of the ovaries) will be used to assess the growth of follicles by observing their increase in size.  The ultrasound technique used for this process at the GOAL Program will involve the gentle placement of a round probe into the vagina for a short ultrasound scan.  <A HREF="figure1.htm">(see fig. 1.)</A>  Results of these tests will allow the physicians to make the necessary medication adjustments in order to get the best follicle development. <BR>

<BR>

Occasionally treatment may have to be cancelled during this process if the ovary does not respond.  If this occurs, a different protocol and/or starting dose of menotropins will be employed for the next IVF attempt.  <BR>

<BR>
<font size="-2"><A HREF="#table_contents">BACK TO THE TOP OF DOCUMENT</A></font>
<p>

<a name="retrieval"<I><B><A HREF ="day1.htm">Egg Retrieval:</A></B></I><BR>

<BR>

After at least 3 follicles have reached a diameter of 17 mm size on ultrasound, another hormone called HCG (Human Chorionic Gonadotropin) will be administered.  This hormone initiates the final maturation of the eggs.  HCG is given late in the evening with the egg retrieval (OPU) scheduled about 34 hours later.<BR>

Example: April 14, HCG at 11:00 pm, <BR>

April 16, OPU at  9:00 am.<BR>

<BR>

Patients are asked to come to the GOAL Program one hour prior to the scheduled egg retrieval.  The woman is asked to change into as hospital gown and an intravenous line will be started by one of the IVF nurses.  A tranquillizer will be given into the intravenous line prior to the procedure.  This will make you relaxed and drowsy but will not put you to sleep.  An intravenous antibiotic is also given to prevent infection.  The cervix is frozen with a local anesthetic and you will be given medications to reduce the pain of the procedure.<BR>

<BR>

The procedure used for egg retrieval at the GOAL Program employs the same vaginal ultrasound probe that was used for follicle monitoring.  An aspiration needle attached to the ultrasound probe will be advanced through the vagina and into the follicles of the ovary.  The follicle fluid and <a href="icsi.htm#cellphoto">eggs</a> will be aspirated into a test tube <A HREF ="figure2.htm">(figure 2)</A>.  The fluids are then handed off to laboratory personnel who will look at the fluid and search for an egg.   After egg retrieval, the woman goes to a recovery area and may leave 2 hours later after the effects of the sedatives have worn off.  <BR>

<BR>

As eggs are found they will be examined under a microscope.  Each egg is then cultured for another 4 to 6 hours, until fully mature in its own plastic dish containing a special growth fluid (media).<BR>

<BR>
<font size="-2"><A HREF="#table_contents">BACK TO THE TOP OF DOCUMENT</A></font>
<p>

<A NAME="sperm"><I><B>Sperm Collection:</B></I><BR>

<BR>
When applicable the male partner will be asked
to produce a semen sample by masturbation
shortly after the egg retrieval. In men who do not
produce sperm in their ejaculate, sperm will
have to be retrieved from them (MESA or TESA)
which can be arranged at the Goal Program. Men
who have poor sperm quality or low numbers of
sperm may have their sperm injected into the
eggs using micro manipulation techniques <a href="icsi.htm">(ICSI)</a>.
Donor sperm may be used as an option to be
discussed and arranged by one of the IVF
physicians prior to starting the IVF treatment. <BR>

<BR>
<font size="-2"><A HREF="#table_contents">BACK TO THE TOP OF DOCUMENT</A></font>
<p>

<A NAME="invitro"><I><B>In Vitro Fertilization:</B></I><BR>

<BR>

After a process, in which the sperm are separated
from the semen, each mature egg is mixed with a
proper number of sperm (usually about 50,000).
If the sperm are of poor quality, fertilization is
facilitated by injection of sperm into egg using
micro manipulation techniques <a href="icsi.htm">(ICSI)</a>.
<p>
On the following morning, eggs are examined
under the microscope. Fertilization will be
evident by the entry of sperm whose genetic
material will be seen as a small area in the egg,
termed the male pronucleus. Similarly, the egg's
genetic material forms a female pronucleus.
These two pronuclei fuse and the fertilized egg
then begins to divide becoming what is now
called a preimplantation embryo<a href="icsi.htm#cellphoto"> (pre-embryo)</a>. <BR>

<BR>
<font size="-2"><A HREF="#table_contents">BACK TO THE TOP OF DOCUMENT</A></font>
<p>

<A NAME="embryo"><I><B><A HREF ="day23.htm">Embryo Transfer:</A></B></I><BR>

<BR>

If fertilization is successful the pre-embryos will then be transferred into the woman's uterine cavity.  A maximum of three embryos will be transferred for women less than 35 years of age and four embryos for women 35 years or older.<BR>

<BR>

This transfer technique is accomplished by placing the pre-embryos (in a small droplet of culture medium) inside a fine plastic tube (transfer catheter) which is then inserted into the uterus through the cervix during a vaginal examination <A HREF ="figure3.htm">(figure 3)</A>.  The process lasts only a few minutes.  Afterwards we will ask the patient to rest for two hours following which she can return home and is requested to take it easy for 1 or 2 days.<BR>

<BR>
<font size="-2"><A HREF="#table_contents">BACK TO THE TOP OF DOCUMENT</A></font>
<p>

<A NAME="cryo"><I><B>Embryo freezing and Cryopreservation:</B></I><BR>

<BR>

Couples who have more good embryos than they can use may have the "extras" or "surplus" frozen for their future use, provided they have signed appropriate consents PRIOR to starting their IVF therapy and have paid the necessary fees for the procedure.<BR>

<BR>
<font size="-2"><A HREF="#table_contents">BACK TO THE TOP OF DOCUMENT</A></font>
<p>

<A NAME="followup"><I><B>Follow-up:</B></I><BR>

<BR>

	If there is no menstrual bleeding 17 days after the embryo transfer, a blood test for pregnancy will be arranged.  If the test is positive, an ultrasound examination will be arranged within the next two weeks.  Once ultrasound confirms the presence of a healthy pregnancy, the IVF physician will discuss plans for pregnancy care with you.
<p>
For those who live at a distance from Ottawa,
telephone follow-up visits may be arranged.

<A NAME="rates"><H3><a href="intro.htm">SUCCESS RATES:</a></H3>


<ul>

<A NAME="reproduction">

<I><B>Normal Human Reproduction:</B></I><BR>

<BR>

	Many people are surprised to realize that normal human reproduction is a relatively inefficient process.  In a healthy couple, the probability of fertilization for any particular exposure of egg to sperm may be as high as 80%, but by the time of the first expected menstrual period after ovulation approximately one-half have miscarried.  The menstrual period may not even be delayed and the couple not even realize that an early pregnancy has been lost.  If a menstrual period is actually missed, as many as one-fourth of these pregnancies end in miscarriage.  Thus, the probability of a live birth after properly timed intercourse through one menstrual cycle in a normally fertile couple is thought to be no higher than 20%.<BR>

<BR>
<font size="-2"><A HREF="#table_contents">BACK TO THE TOP OF DOCUMENT</A></font>
<p>

<a name="cycle"><I><B>IVF Cycle:</B></I><BR>

<BR>

It must be acknowledged that problems can and
do arise at any point during the In Vitro
Fertilization process. To date the rate of live
births (per treatment started) following IVF in
well established and reputable clinics are about
20% per treatment cycle. <a href="intro.htm">Success rates at the Goal
Program</a> have been better than reported by the
average IVF clinic.<BR>

<BR>

	With these data, it must be emphasized that
successful conception and childbirth cannot be
guaranteed by an IVF Program, even if the
couple undergoes multiple attempts. The
probability of success depends on many factors
including: the woman's age (success rates are
much lower when over 38 years old), addictions
(alcohol, smoking) and ovarian response to the
stimulating medications.<BR>

	Problems which may arise during IVF treatment include:<BR>



<UL><IMG SRC="bulblue.gif">A poor hormone response to the medication.  If this happens treatment will be terminated before follicular aspirationcan take place.  This causes IVF to be delayed to a later cycle (up to 3-6 months).<BR></UL>

</ul>

<a name="risk"><H3>POSSIBLE RISKS OF IVF TREATMENT:</H3>



	There are some risks and discomforts associated with the procedure.<BR>

<BR>

<ul>
<a name="injection"><I><B>Injections:</B></I><BR>

<BR>

Medication injections can cause some local irritation and repeated blood testing can be associated with mild discomfort and bruising of the arm.<BR>

<BR>
<font size="-2"><A HREF="#table_contents">BACK TO THE TOP OF DOCUMENT</A></font>
<p>

<a name="medication"><I><B>Medications:</B></I><BR>

<BR>

The "fertility drugs" may over stimulate the
ovary and cause some pelvic discomfort due to
the formation of ovarian cysts. Rarely, (in 2 - 3%
of women) these drugs can cause so much
ovarian over-stimulation that hospitalization and
medical therapy is needed.<BR>

<BR>
<font size="-2"><A HREF="#table_contents">BACK TO THE TOP OF DOCUMENT</A></font>
<p>

<a name="egg"><B><I>Egg Retrieval:</B></I><BR>

<BR>

The ultrasound egg retrieval procedure presents
a rare possibility of infection or injury to
abdominal organs or blood vessels. Although
pain medicine (intravenous narcotics and local
anesthetic) is given, some discomfort will be
experienced during the egg retrieval process.<BR>

<BR>
<font size="-2"><A HREF="#table_contents">BACK TO THE TOP OF DOCUMENT</A></font>
<p>
<a name="transfer"><B><I>Embryo Transfer:</I></B><BR>

<BR>

The transfer of 3-4 embryos not only increases the
chances of a pregnancy but also increases the
chance of multiple pregnancy (e.g., twins, or
triplets). For this reason not all your embryos
will be returned to you if there are more than 3 or
4 of them.<BR>

<BR><font size="-2"><A HREF="#table_contents">BACK TO THE TOP OF DOCUMENT</A></font>
<p>

<a name="malformations"><I><B>Fetal and Newborn Malformations:</B></I><BR>

<BR>

IVF-ET does not increase the chance of an
abnormal child being born. Hundreds of
thousands of normal healthy children have been
born worldwide form this treatment. Similar to
normal conception, two to three percent of infants
born from IVF have some malformation or
abnormality. <BR>

<BR>

<font size="-2"><A HREF="#table_contents">BACK TO THE TOP OF DOCUMENT</A></font>
<p>
</ul>
<a name="approach"><H3>TEAM APPROACH:</H3>

<ul>

IVF is a complicated procedure involving physicians, nurses, scientists, laboratory technologists, sonographers and counsellors.  We are proud of the excellent team we have assembled to assist you throughout this process.  If you experience any problems or have concerns, please let us know.<BR>

<BR>
<font size="-2"><A HREF="#table_contents">BACK TO THE TOP OF DOCUMENT</A></font>
</ul>
<p>


<a name="psychosocial"><H3>PSYCHOSOCIAL COMPONENT OF OUR PROGRAM:</H3>

<ul>

The process of In Vitro Fertilization is associated with a certain degree of emotional strain.  For the majority of couples, IVF represents the final hope for pregnancy after a long and difficult course of investigation and infertility treatment.  The IVF process is demanding, outside your control, occurs in an unfamiliar environment, and has no guarantee of a successful outcome, all of which contribute to stress.  While most couples find their way to cope with the stresses of the IVF procedure, all couples will be aware of the pressures which it places upon them.  The GOAL program personnel want to ensure that your decision to enrol in the program is well informed and carefully considered.  They are ready to share in your concerns.  If needed, a psychologist is available to counsel or help you with stress management (no charge).<BR>

	<p> Ontario residents will not be billed for
most medical, laboratory or counseling services as long as these
services are paid for by the Ministry of Health (i.e.. if the cause
of infertility is obstruction of the Fallopian tubes).<br>
Out-of-province residents are charged for each IVF attempt.

<br> In addition to fees paid to the Goal Program, all patients will be
responsible for their drug costs. Patients are encouraged to obtain coverage
for these drugs from an insurance company. For non-Ontario
residents payment in full by a certified cheque is required
before the initial interview with the nurse.  </p>

	<CENTER><B><H2>SPERM MICROINJECTION (ICSI)<br><br>

	INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</H2></B></CENTER>

<HR>



<H3><B>History</B></H3>

Sperm microinjection (Intra-cytoplasmic spermatozoa injection -ICSI) was developed mainly to treat severe male infertility.  It has been researched over the last ten years, but its effectiveness has been demonstrated only in late 1993 in Brussels, Belgium.  ICSI allows infertile couples with a severe male factor to have genetically related offspring.
<p>

<h3>For more detailed information on the history and technique of ICSI click 
<a href="http://www.inciid.org/icsi.html">here </a>
</h3>



<br>

<H3><B>Who is ICSI for?</B></H3>

<IMG SRC="bulred.gif"> Severe male infertility

<ul> Severe oligospermia (<1,000,000 sperm/mL)<BR>

Severe asthenospermia (low motility)<BR></ul>

   

<IMG SRC="bulred.gif">Absence or less than 5% fertilization rate after conventional in vitro  fertilization (ordinarily associated with undetected male infertility in the semen analysis or with light to moderate infertility)<br>

<BR>

<IMG SRC="bulred.gif">In vitro fertilization after epididymal sperm aspiration (MESA: removal of sperm from the testicles using microscopic surgery).<BR>

<br>

<IMG SRC="bulred.gif">Polyspermia (more than one sperm entering the egg) in conventional in vitro fertilization.<BR>

<BR>

<br>

<H3><B>What is ICSI?</B></H3>

This new technique facilitates laboratory fertilization via the microinjection of one sperm inside the egg. Sperm with a low motility can thus be helped to penetrate the shell around the egg (zona pellucida), and achieve sperm-egg fusion.  A single living sperm, even with poor motility, can fertilize the egg.  Only the microinjection aspect of this technique, done in the laboratory, differs from conventional IVF.  In ICSI, the woman must follow the same procedure as for IVF with ovarian stimulation and ovum pick-up, followed by laboratory fertilization and embryo transfer after 48 hours.

<br>

<br>

<br>
<a name="cellphoto">
<IMG SRC="icsi1.jpg" align=right><h3></a>
The micropipette containing a single spermatozoon is pushed through the zona pellucida and the oolemma into the ooplasm at 3 o'clock.</h3><BR>

<p>



<br>

<br>

<H3><B>Results of fertilization with ICSI</B></H3>

<IMG SRC="bulred.gif">Less than 15% ova damage<BR>

<br>

<IMG SRC="bulred.gif">71% of microinjection ova will produce embryos<BR>

<br>

<IMG SRC="bulred.gif">90% of attempts result in embryo transfer<BR>

<br>

<IMG SRC="bulred.gif">Clinical pregnancy rates:

         <ul>20% per trial<BR>

         25% per embryo transfer<BR></ul>

<IMG SRC="bulred.gif">Fetal abnormality rate is the same as in the general population.

<br>

<br>

<br>

<H3><B>Impact</H3></B>

The wonder of ICSI lies in the fact that the pregnancy rate with this technique, for severe male infertility, is the same as with conventional IVF for tubal factor infertility.  ICSI allows many infertile couples, whose only choices had been insemination with donor sperm or adoption, to become parents of their own genetically related children, thereby reducing the indications for TDI (Therapeutic Donor Insemination) and adoption.

	March, 1995

<h2>GENERAL RESEARCH INTEREST:</h2>


         My general interest is on the biochemistry/physiology of spermand male reproductive cells.  Three main
lines of research I have been focusing on in the last 11 years are:<br>
<table cellspacint=10>
<tr><td valign=top>     1.  <td>     The cell biology/biochemistry of sperm capacitation and sperm-egg interaction. This line
             of research has been performed since 1985 when I first joined the human In Vitro Fertilization
             (IVF) Program at Beth Israel Hospital,Boston.  The information obtained from this study
             is pertinent to the IVF process.  The present focus on this research studies is an characterization
             and discerning the role of sulfogalactosylglycerolipid (SGG) and its binding protein (sulfolipidimmobilizing
             protein 1-SLIP1) as sperm capacitation and sperm-egg interaction.  See details for research
             support below.
</tr>
<tr><td valign=top>     2.  <td>     Male contraception.  I started to be interested in this  line of research since I was in Thailand,
             my homeland country, as it is one of the most populated countries in the world.  This interest
             was carried on when I moved to Harvard Medical School in 1981.  Specifically, I was studying
             the molecular mechanisms of gossypol, a male contraceptive used in China, on Sertoli cells. 
             From 1981-1987, I received a number of operating grants for this study including four
             from the Rockefeller Foundation and one from World Health Organization as well as one
             subcontract from NIH through H.G. Pars Company.  I held one grant (1989-1992) on
             the effects of gossypol on kidney cells from the Rockefeller Foundation.  In addition, it
             is expected that the obtained information from the study described in 1) would lead to development
             of  immunocontraceptives and vaginal contraceptives based on molecules specific to gametes. 
</tr>
<tr><td valign=top>     3.   <td>    Reproductive biotechnology related to the IVF.  I have developed interest in alleviating
             male infertility problems using laboratory procedures.  This line of my research interest
             was funded by NSERC as well as operating fund from the human IVF program (GOAL)
             at the Ottawa Civic Hospital.</tr>
</table>
         I was in Thailand from 1975 to 1981 as a  faculty member and an independent investigator in the Department
of Biochemistry, Mahidol University.  My research interest, additional to the male contraception field (as described
above), lied in the fields of the structure of sperm chromatin (as evidenced by publications #9-11, 14-16), sperm
maturation and sperm motility (as evidenced by publications #6-7, 10).  These research activities were supported
by the Ford Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation, World Health Organization, International Planned Parenthood
Foundation (IPPF), and the NRC of Thailand.<br>

Relevant Experience to the Thai Canadian HRD Project:  I am a Thai citizen who understands the Thai culture and
language very well.  I have experience as a faculty member and a research scientist in Thai, American and Canadian
academic institutes.  Although I have lived in North America for the past 12 years, I still keep in touch with Thai colleagues
by yearly visit, which includes seminar presentation at various universities.  In addition, I had several Thai scientists
working in my laboratory.  I keep in touch with other Thai professionals in North America and serve as a task force
member to the Association of Thai Professionals in America and Canada.  Furthermore, I regularly attend international
meetings and conferences and have numerous connections with scientists around the world.  My research activities
have been funded both by international organizations as well as MRC Canada.  My research and expertise in reproductive
technology has allowed me to work closely with clinicians in the human In Vitro Fertilization and Embryo Transfer
Programs and in clinically-oriented research projects.  The clinical treatment, applied science and technology are important
for generating revenues for sustaining the proposed Thai-Canadian HRD Project.  
<br><br>
     A number of Thai scientists and clinicians have been trained in my laboratory at the Loeb Research Institute,
these include Drs. Sopit Wongkham and Malivalaya Namking (participants in this Linkage Program) and clinician,
Dr. Pansak Sugkraroek, Praram 9 Hospital, (a collaborative Partner Institute in this Linkage Program) 
<br><br>
     Recently, I have written a Planning Mission and Visit Proposal to CIDA which was awarded to support Drs.
Sopit Wongkham and Kamoltip Brown to visit the University of Ottawa (March 30, 1994 to April 12, 1994).  After
meetings and discussions with a number of the Canadian faculty members, we have prepared this CIDA Linkage Project.

<B>MNR Introduces Red Tape Changes
</B>
</CENTER><P>
Natural Resources Minister Chris Hodgson today proposed changes to reduce Red Tape that will protect more than $11 million annually for forest renewal and improve a number of planning regulations.<P>

"MNR's proposed red tape changes will ensure that $11 million in forest renewal money continues to be dedicated to our forests," said 
Mr. Hodgson.  "Another key red tape change will improve MNR's planning on Crown land.  We will maintain our ability to manage natural resources sustainably."<P>

MNR will protect forest renewal funds by amending the Crown Forest Sustainability Act to clarify that funds dedicated by the forest industry to the provincial Forest Renewal Trust fund are Crown assets for forest renewal.  This amendment avoids the risk of these funds being subject to federal taxation.  All the money in the renewal trust fund will be available for forest renewal.  This is consistent with the original intent of the Crown Forest Sustainability Act.<P>

"MNR's Red Tape changes will affect 17 pieces of legislation and eliminate unnecessary regulations.  The changes are part of the government's commitment to reduce the costs of government while improving public services," Mr. Hodgson said.<P>

Changes to the Public Lands Act will improve MNR's land-use planning process for Crown land.  MNR will set clear rules for appropriate, environmentally sensitive development and give industries working on Crown land more certainty about making business decisions.<P>

Changes to Ontario Parks legislation will increase the maximum fine for damaging park natural and cultural heritage and other offences to $25,000, from $5,000.  Changes will also allow MNR to enforce clean-up and repair orders.<P>

Lakes and Rivers Improvement Act changes emphasize public safety, increase the level of fines, streamline the approval process for construction and repair of dams, and add the ability to issue a 
stop-work order consistent with protecting public health and safety.<P>

MNR will streamline forestry legislation by reducing 11 Acts to five and by repealing outdated legislation.  Key elements of five Acts will be consolidated into a proposed new Forestry Act that will cover MNR's commitment to assisting forestry on private land.  To help protect valuable private forests, fines are being increased for improper cutting of trees.<P>

Changes to the Forest Fires Prevention Act remove red tape from declaring Restricted Fire Zones during serious periods of forest fires.  Restricted Fire Zones are a tool MNR uses to help protect public safety during forest fire emergencies.<P>

MNR proposes changes to the Conservation Authorities (CA) Act to follow up on the province's earlier introduction of changes that clearly identify flood control and the protection of provincially significant conservation lands as the provincial interest in CA matters.  Participating municipalities will determine the other work of CAs.   New changes to the CA Act remove the province from unnecessary intrusion into local decision-making.<P>

Changes in surveying legislation will transfer the responsibility for developing standards for monumentation to the Association of Ontario Land Surveyors, whose members have the expertise and experience to administer the activity.  Changes to the Mining Act will allow for the consolidation of three regulations covering the disposition of 
Crown-owned oil and gas into one regulation.<P>

MNR will post all its proposed Red Tape amendments on the Environmental Bill of Rights (EBR) registry for 45 days for public review and comment.  The names of people to contact are included with each posted amendment.  MNR will consider comments it receives before finalizing proposed amendments.<P>

<B>Background Information on MNR's Red Tape Changes
</B>
</CENTER><P>
The Ministry of Natural Resources has proposed changes to reduce Red Tape in forestry and forest fire legislation, the Conservation Authorities Act, the Public Lands Act, the Lakes and Rivers Improvement Act, provincial park legislation and surveying legislation.<P>

Many of the changes will improve the delivery of government services; others update aspects of legislation, consolidate a number of Acts into simpler, more-focused legislation and remove unnecessary regulation.  In some cases, MNR used Red Tape changes as an opportunity to improve government by strengthening fines and the ability to control activities related to natural resources management.  The changes will also create new opportunities for business and industry involved in resource management activities.<P>

MNR will maintain its ability to manage natural resources sustainably.  This fact sheet outlines the intent of the changes to various pieces of legislation.<B><P><BR>


Crown Forest Sustainability Act (CFSA):</B><P>
MNR will add a clause to the CFSA to resolve tax issues between the forest industry in Ontario and the federal government.  The change will clarify that funds dedicated by the forest industry to the provincial Forest Renewal Trust Fund are Crown assets for forest renewal.  This amendment protects forest renewal funds by clarifying that funds dedicated by the forest industry to the provincial Forest Renewal Trust Fund are Crown assets for forest renewal.  This will avoid the risk of these funds being subject to taxation.<P>

All the money in the renewal trust fund will be available for forest renewal.  This is consistent with the original intent of the Crown Forest Sustainability Act.<P><BR>

<B>Forestry legislation:</B><P>
MNR will reduce the number of Acts related to forestry to 5 from 11.  MNR will consolidate key elements of five Acts into a proposed new Forestry Act which will:<P>
<UL>
<LI>incorporate parts of the Woodlands Improvement Act (WIA) covering MNR's commitment to assisting forestry on private land.  MNR will repeal the WIA
<LI>include parts of the Trees Act that authorize municipal governments to enact bylaws that cover what can be done with trees in a municipality.  MNR will repeal the Trees Act
<LI>increase fines for improper cutting of trees to help protect important forest resources on private land and increase other fines
<LI>include parts of the Forest Tree Pest Control Act to provide authority for dealing with serious insect infestations on Crown or private land.  MNR will repeal the Pest Control Act
</UL><P>

MNR will also repeal the Spruce Pulpwood Exportation Act and the Settler's Pulpwood Protection Act because the CFSA covers these Acts and will repeal the Forestry Workers Employment Act because current labor legislation addresses this Act.<P><BR>

<B>Forest Fires Prevention Act:</B><P>
Changes remove Red Tape from declaring Restricted Fires Zones during serious periods of forest fires.  Restricted Fire Zones are a tool MNR uses to help protect public safety during forest fire emergencies.<P><BR>

<B>Public Lands Act:</B><P>
Changes clarify MNR's ability to conduct land use planning.  The ministry will improve its land use planning process, set clear rules for appropriate, environmentally sensitive development and give industries working on Crown land more certainty about making business decisions.<P>

Other changes:<P>
<UL>
<LI>shorten the time to sell a piece of Crown land larger than five hectares making the time frame consistent with the treatment of small lots
<LI>simplify the sale of waterlots under the Act
<LI>simplify the process for transferring administrative control of public land to other provincial ministries, to Crown agencies or to the federal government
<LI>establish the province's ability to remove conditions on patents that restrict the right of landowners to develop natural resources on their land
<LI>allow MNR to develop management agreements to use public land with government and non-government organizations
<LI>simplify the setting of fees for using public land
</UL><P><BR>

<B>Ontario Parks legislation:</B><P>
Changes increase the maximum fine for damaging park natural and cultural heritage and other offences to $25,000, from $5,000, consistent with fines by other agencies.<P>
Other changes:<P>
<UL>
<LI>allow MNR to enforce clean-up and repair orders
<LI>define the authority of Park Wardens
<LI>simplify and consolidate regulations covering activities in parks
</UL><P><BR>


<B>Lakes and Rivers Improvement Act:</B><P>
Some changes emphasize public safety and increase the level of fines.<P>Other changes:<P>
<UL>
<LI>streamline the approval process for construction and repair of dams
<LI>add the ability to issue a stop-work order consistent with protecting public health and safety and with protecting natural resources
<LI>allow the development of management agreements
<LI>repeal sections of the Act that relate to log drives (using lakes and rivers to move timber), because the activity has not been undertaken for years
<LI>use the municipal tax system to collect debts from private landowners to reimburse MNR for work it does to deal with unsafe structures around water that pose a public risk

</UL><P><BR>


<B>Conservation Authorities (CA) Act:</B><P>
Changes will follow up on the province's earlier introduction of changes that clearly identify flood control and protection of provincially significant conservation lands as the provincial interest in CA matters.<P>
The latest changes:<P>
<UL>
<LI>will clarify the CA role in hazard management consistent with the provincial interest in provincial policy statements.
<LI>will revise regulations on fill and construction to focus on important wetlands, shorelines and other natural hazard areas
<LI>will streamline approval of CA regulations
<LI>will provide municipalities in a CA watershed with at least 30 days notice of proposed budgets and levies
<LI>will remove the province from involvement in CA business that is not related to the provincial interest.  This includes grouping municipalities for appointment of members to a CA, enlarging a CA, amalgamating CAs, and a number of housekeeping changes.
</UL><P><BR>


<B>Surveying legislation:</B><P>
Complementary changes to the Surveys Act and the Surveyors Act will transfer the responsibility for developing standards for monumentation to the self-governing Association of Ontario Land Surveyors, whose members have the expertise and experience to administer these standards.  Any proposals made by the association require government approval before implementation.  Monumentation refers to physical reference points placed during the surveying of land.<P><BR>

<B>Mining Act:</B><P>
Changes will allow for the consolidation of three regulations covering the disposition of Crown-owned oil and gas into one regulation.<P><BR>

<B>Public Review of MNR's proposed red tape changes:</B><P>
MNR will post all its proposed Red Tape amendments on the Environmental Bill of Rights (EBR) registry for 45 days for public review and comment.  The names of people to contact are included with each posted amendment.  MNR will consider comments it receives before finalizing proposed amendments.

<IMG SRC="Mandat.gif"><P>
<BODY>
<H3>BUT DU MRN</H3>
Contribuer au bien-&ecirc;tre environnemental, social et &eacute;conomique de l'Ontario gr&acirc;ce au d&eacute;veloppement durable des ressources naturelles.<P>
<H3>OBJECTIFS DU MRN</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Assurer des &eacute;cosyst&egrave;mes sains &agrave; long terme par la protection de nos pr&eacute;cieuses ressources en terres, en eaux, en for&ecirc;ts et en faune, ainsi que de leurs fondements biologiques;
<LI>Assurer la disponibilit&eacute; continue et &agrave; long terme de nos ressources naturelles au profit des Ontariens et Ontariennes; soit, pouvoir l&eacute;guer aux g&eacute;n&eacute;rations futures les richesses naturelles dont nous jouissons aujourd'hui encore;
<LI>Prot&eacute;ger le patrimoine naturel et les caract&eacute;ristiques biologiques d'importance provinciale;
<LI>Prot&eacute;ger les vies humaines, les ressources et les propri&eacute;t&eacute;s contre les incendies de for&ecirc;t, les inondations et l'&eacute;rosion.
</UL>
Ces objectifs n&eacute;cessitent l'adoption d'une d&eacute;marche &eacute;cosyst&eacute;mique pour la gestion des ressources naturelles de l'Ontario, la notion d'<I>&eacute;cosyst&egrave;me</I> englobant autant les activit&eacute;s socio-&eacute;conomiques humaines que l'&eacute;volution du milieu naturel.<P>
&Eacute;tant donn&eacute; que la propri&eacute;t&eacute; essentielle d'un &eacute;cosyst&egrave;me sain est sa durabilit&eacute;, on peut aussi d&eacute;crire le but du MRN comme &eacute;tant d'assurer la vitalit&eacute; des &eacute;cosyst&egrave;mes en &eacute;quilibrant les exigences environnementales, &eacute;conomiques et sociales.<P>
Contraintes fiscales et changements rapides forcent les gouvernements &agrave; concentrer leurs efforts sur les r&eacute;sultats.  Pour un minist&egrave;re, la port&eacute;e de ses responsabilit&eacute;s se trouvera plus clairement d&eacute;finie et pourra &ecirc;tre syst&eacute;matiquement &eacute;valu&eacute;e si les r&eacute;sultats attendus sont d&eacute;finis clairement, les priorit&eacute;s d&eacute;termin&eacute;es avec pr&eacute;cision et les contributions de diverses activit&eacute;s, fonctions et strat&eacute;gies &eacute;valu&eacute;es avec plus de rigueur.<P>
<H3>AVANTAGES</H3>
La r&eacute;alisation des quatre objectifs avanc&eacute;s ci-dessus se traduit par des avantages consid&eacute;rables pour la province :<P>
<UL>
<LI>&eacute;cosyst&egrave;mes sains
<LI>milieu naturel sain et sans dangers pour les humains
<LI>emplois bas&eacute;s sur l'exploitation des ressources
<LI>stabilit&eacute; des collectivit&eacute;s
<LI>vitalit&eacute; concurrentielle des industries des ressources naturelles
<LI>revenus pour la province
<LI>loisirs de plein air
</UL><P>
La part que contribue le MRN &agrave; chaque avantage varie d'une r&eacute;gion de la province &agrave; l'autre.  D'autres organismes gouvernementaux et d'autres secteurs de la soci&eacute;t&eacute; y contribuent &eacute;galement.<P>

<B>Red And White Pine In Ontario<P>
FACT SHEET</B></CENTER><P>
Ontario has almost 4 million hectares of red and white pine, with a concentration ranging from 10 per cent to more than 40 per cent on any given stand.  This includes red and white pine in protected areas, conservation reserves and areas available for logging.<P>

Forest areas where red and white pine are the dominant species (40 per cent or more of all species present on any given stand), cover 723,658 ha.<P>

In forest areas where red and white pine dominate, more than 124,000 ha are classified as old red and white pine.  In these areas, MNR policy on the conservation of old growth pine will ensure that red and white pine forest ecosystems, including old growth stands, are present on the landscape now and in the future.<P>

To qualify as red and white pine old growth, a forest must meet certain criteria including the presence of old trees, associated trees and other plants, and little or no traces of activities such as logging.<P>

MNR has protected 66,000 ha of old growth red and white pine - 46,000 ha in provincial parks and conservation reserves, and 20,000 ha in no-cut reserves in forest management areas.  The following table shows the total area of red 
and white pine forests older than 120 years that are protected in Ontario:<P>

</TABLE><P>
This protection of red and white pine across its range includes 16,345 ha of old growth red and white pine forest in Quetico Wilderness Park in Northwestern Ontario, and in the Southcentral Region, 955 ha as part of 11,250 ha of protected red and white pine 81 years and older in Algonquin Park.<P>

 Of the total 66,000 ha area, nearly 11,000 ha is old growth red and white pine that is protected in the Temagami area.  A citizens committee, the Comprehensive Planning Council (CPC), recommended that the government protect 12 old growth red and white pine sites in Temagami.  The government accepted the CPC's recommendations on old growth.<P>
<B>Protection and Regeneration</B><P>
MNR has adopted a <I>Conservation Strategy For Old Growth Red and White Pine Ecosystems in Ontario</I>.  It commits MNR to protecting representative areas of old growth red and white pine forests to allow those areas to evolve through natural ecological processes.<P>
A key feature of MNR's conservation strategy is to leave healthy old trees (120 years and older), snags (standing dead trees), dying and rotting trees on red and white pine sites after logging.  MNR's goal is to ensure that a range of ages from young to old red and white pine trees are left in areas across the forested landscape.<P>
Where possible, protected areas will be surrounded by young red and white pine forest, so that the full range of ages is maintained to replace old growth in protected areas that change as a result of successional pressures such as wildfire and individual tree mortality.<P>
To ensure genetic conservation, natural regeneration, and wildlife habitat protection in red and white pine forests, MNR will leave healthy, mature seed trees in the harvested area, including some of the straightest and oldest, as well as dead and dying trees.  In addition, tree tops and limbs of harvested trees are left on the forest floor to provide wildlife habitat.<P>
In addition to protection and regeneration, the conservation strategy identifies other goals:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Ensuring that in a stand where it is the dominant species, red and white pine will be maintained.<P>
<LI>Ensuring that red and white pine areas are not reduced to less than current levels.<P>
<LI>Restoring red and white pine areas, guided by historical records, within the bounds of silvicultural funding at the management unit level.<P>
<LI>Ensuring an age distribution that maintains old red and white pine stands in areas across the forested landscape.<P>
<LI>Providing a sustainable supply of red and white pine to the forest industry.

<B>The Owain Lake Block<P>
FACT SHEET</B></CENTER><P>

The Owain Lake Block is located about 10 km west of the southern end of Lake Temiskaming, approximately 45 km south-east of the town of Temagami.  This 
321-ha harvest area is part of a larger, mature forest containing stands of red, white and jack pine. The Owain Lake Block is being partially logged.<P>

Significant portions of the Owain Lake Block were harvested before.  It is likely that the area was harvested before the turn of the century.  In addition, aerial photographs taken in 1946 show conclusively that approximately half of the block was harvested sometime between the late 1930s and the early 1940s.<P>

The Comprehensive Planning Council (CPC), a citizens committee, considered 
Owain Lake when it reviewed sites to be protected as old growth.  The government accepted the CPC's recommendations that the Owain Lake Block did not qualify as a representative old growth site that should be protected from harvest.<P>

Following extensive public consultation, the CPC recommended a land-use strategy for Temagami that included recommendations on protecting old growth red and white pine areas.  The government accepted the CPC's recommendations on protecting old growth.<P>

<B>Conservation Strategy</B><P>

In planning for harvesting in the Owain Lake Block, MNR has applied its <I>Conservation Strategy For Old Growth Red And White Pine Forest Ecosystems</I>.  This means that many old trees in the Owain Lake Block will not be logged in 1996 and after any future shelterwood harvests; snags, dying and rotting trees will be left standing; and tree tops and limbs will be left on the forest floor.  In addition, the plan leaves 93 ha in no-cut reserves where no logging will take place.<P>
 
The plan permits partial logging in 228 ha of the block.  Species to be harvested include jack pine, spruce, poplar and white birch, as well as red and white pine.  The "shelterwood system" used in the Owain Lake Block is a widely recognized harvesting method that encourages natural regeneration by leaving healthy mature trees standing, as well as snags, tree tops and limbs on the forest floor.<P>

<B>Temagami Old Growth Red And White Pine</B><P>

MNR has protected nearly 11,000 ha old growth red and white pine in the Temagami area.  This includes all 12 old growth red and white pine sites that the CPC recommended for protection.<P>

<B>Old Growth in Ontario</B><P>

Protected areas in Ontario where old growth red and white pine is the dominant species (40 per cent or more), cover 66,000 ha - 46,000 ha in provincial parks and conservation reserves, and 20,000 ha in no-cut reserves in forest management units.  As the dominant species on any given stand, old red and white pine cover more than 124,000 ha in Ontario.<P>

Forests containing a component of red and white pine cover almost 4 million ha in Ontario, in an area that covers much of Southern Ontario, north to Lake Temiskaming and west to an area just south of Wawa.  The red and white pine range also covers an area around Thunder Bay, Dryden, Fort Frances and Kenora.  Both species are common in the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence forest region.<P>

<CENTER><B>Province Adopts Strategy to Enhance<BR>
Environmental Protection in Temagami</B></CENTER><P>

The province today announced a comprehensive land-use strategy for the Temagami area that will increase environmental protection, protect more old growth sites and resolve long-standing land-use issues.<P>

"Our government has promised fair and common-sense principles for meeting the objectives of environmental protection in Temagami," said Natural Resources Minister Chris Hodgson.  "This 
land-use strategy sets up a framework that will protect the environment, improve community stability and, after years of uncertainty, get on with the job of enhancing the quality of life in the Temagami area."<P>

Through the land-use strategy, MNR will create Protected Areas that prohibit resource extraction and Special Management Areas that require careful management of resource extraction.  In both areas MNR will allow and encourage recreation and tourism.  These areas will provide additional protection around Lady Evelyn-Smoothwater Provincial Park.  Together these areas total 300,000 hectares, an area about three times the size of the 100,000 hectares of forests and waters protected in seven provincial parks in the Temagami area.<P>

The province developed its comprehensive strategy from the 39 recommendations the Comprehensive Planning Council (CPC) presented to the government in April..<P>

"The CPC and predecessors spent nearly a decade undertaking extensive consultation with the public and studying land-use issues before recommending locally developed solutions," Mr. Hodgson said.<P>

The province's strategy adopts 22 of the CPC recommendations without change and adopts the other 17 recommendations with minor changes.<P>

As part of the strategy, the province will protect an additional 2,628 hectares of old growth red and white pine and will also protect the 3,520 hectare North Obabika site, which includes 939 hectares of old growth red and white pine.  Protected old growth red and white pine sites will cover 10,800 hectares in provincial parks, the Lake Temagami skyline reserve and a new protection zone.<P>

"This government recognizes the importance of old growth forests.  That_s why we_ve increased the area of protected old growth red and white pine," Mr. Hodgson said.  "We also recognize the importance of protecting headwaters in the Lady Evelyn-Smoothwater park area and through the strategy we have added the necessary safeguards."<P>

The province has also acknowledged the need to resolve outstanding issues with local aboriginal communities.  To provide the opportunity for resolution, the province has set aside lands that could form part of a land claim settlement.  The Ontario Native Affairs Secretariat will pursue a resolution over the next two years.<P>




"We want to improve the quality of life for all communities in the Temagami area and that is why we have included in this strategy significant measures that allow us to work out agreements with local aboriginal communities," Mr. Hodgson said..<P>

Through the new strategy, MNR will establish four new land use zones in the Temagami area.  These zones were recommended by the CPC.  They are:
<UL>
<LI>Protected Areas where logging, mineral and aggregate extraction are not permitted
<LI>Special Management Areas where resource extraction will be allowed under special prescriptions to ensure protection of significant resource values
<LI>Integrated Management Areas where resource extraction and development will be carefully managed and public access will be less restricted than in the Protected and Special Management areas
<LI>Developed Areas where resource management will be permitted and controlled to ensure it is compatible with other uses.
</UL><P>
MNR will also spend until September 30 working with local interests to examine a new governance structure for Temagami as part of the ministry's acceptance of the CPC recommendation on this issue.<P>

As a result of the implementation of the new comprehensive strategy, staking of new mining claims will be allowed to resume in areas identified for resource development.  Following a notice period, staking will begin September 17.  The notice period will be longer than the usual 60-day period to notify claim holders of the re-opening and to produce new, up-to-date maps for use by claim seekers.<P><BR>

Chronology of Public Consultation on
Temagami Land Use Planning


</B></CENTER><P><BR>

Over the past decade, land use and resource management issues in the Temagami area have been the subject of considerable public debate -- and a great deal of public consultation -- in an attempt to resolve the issues.  This fact sheet offers a chronology of those public consultation efforts, including the significant groups and decisions involved, from 1987 to the present.<P>

<TABLE BORDER="1" WIDTH="100%" CELLPADDING=6>
<TR VALIGN="TOP">
<TD WIDTH="25%">
<B>December 1987:</B></TD><TD>	The Temagami Area Working Group (TAWG) is established by then Natural Resources Minister Vincent Kerrio to review and recommend solutions to land and resource use conflicts on the Crown land area around Lady Evelyn-Smoothwater Provincial Park.</TD></TR>

<TR VALIGN="TOP">
<TD WIDTH="25%">
<B>January to 
March 1988:</B></TD><TD>		TAWG hosts public meetings, receives submissions from interested groups and delivers its report to the Minister.  Its recommendations include making Temagami a model district in the management of its forestry, recreation, tourism and earth and life science features.  It also recommended the creation of a citizens' committee to advise the government on Temagami land use and resource management issues.</TD></TR>

<TR VALIGN="TOP">
<TD WIDTH="25%">
<B>July 1988:</B></TD><TD>		The Temagami Advisory Council (TAC) is established to advise the government on land and resource management matters in the area, including advice on the construction of an extension to the Red Squirrel Road.
</TD></TR>

<TR VALIGN="TOP">
<TD WIDTH="25%">
<B>August 1989:</B></TD><TD>		Then Natural Resources Minister Lyn McLeod announces the Temagami Area Comprehensive Planning Program (CPP), and sets a completion date of March 31, 1992.  TAC is asked to seek public participation and develop recommendations for a comprehensive land use and resource management plan.</TD></TR>

<TR VALIGN="TOP">
<TD WIDTH="25%">
<B>January 1990:</B></TD><TD>	TAC meets with more than 25 organizations to gather comments on draft objectives it has designed to guide the comprehensive planning program.</TD></TR>

<TR VALIGN="TOP">
<TD WIDTH="25%">
<B>August to
September 1990:</B></TD><TD>	TAC holds open houses in seven communities to discuss the background information that will be used to prepare its comprehensive land use and resource management plan, and invites comments on a revised set of planning objectives.</TD></TR>

<TR VALIGN="TOP">
<TD WIDTH="25%">

<B> May 1991:</B></TD><TD>		Then Natural Resources Minister Bud Wildman replaces TAC with the Comprehensive Planning Council (CPC) to strengthen the role of local communities in the management of natural resources in the Temagami area, and extends the deadline for the comprehensive plan to March 31, 1994.  The Ontario government and the Teme-Augama Anishnabai jointly establish the Wendaban Stewardship Authority (WSA) to develop a Forest Stewardship Plan for four townships at the centre of the Temagami area.</TD></TR>

<TR VALIGN="TOP">
<TD WIDTH="25%">
<B>July 1992:</B></TD><TD>		The WSA hosts a meeting with local individuals and interested groups to discuss methods for public participation in the development of its Forest Stewardship Plan.</TD></TR>

<TR VALIGN="TOP">
<TD WIDTH="25%">
<B>September 1992
to September 1993:</B></TD><TD>	The CPC conducts public consultations on behalf of the province and the Teme-Augama Anishnabai as part of the negotiations for a Treaty of Co-existence.  As a result of the negotiations, the Teme-Augama Anishnabai join the CPC on an interim basis.  The deadline for the comprehensive plan is again extended, to March 31, 1996.</TD></TR>

<TR VALIGN="TOP">
<TD WIDTH="25%">
<B>October 1993:</B></TD><TD>	After two more public meetings to identify problems and outstanding issues, and receive comments on goals and objectives, the WSA hosts a final public review and critique of the planning options and zoning decisions in its Forest Stewardship Plan.</TD></TR>

<TR VALIGN="TOP">
<TD WIDTH="25%">
<B>May to
August 1994:</B></TD><TD>		The CPC releases three alternative scenarios for the Temagami Comprehensive Planning Area (excluding the area covered by the WSA's Forest Stewardship Plan).  The scenarios reflect a range of potential land use alternatives, degrees of commercial development and resource protection.  The CPC seeks public reaction by holding open houses and workshops in four communities, and through 14 meetings with interested organizations.</TD></TR>

<TR VALIGN="TOP">
<TD WIDTH="25%">
<B>February 1995:</B></TD><TD>	Then Natural Resources Minister Howard Hampton announces Ontario's intention to protect the Obabika Lake North old-growth site, a significant provincial example of old-growth pine forest.  At the same time, the province removes all or parts of nine townships located northeast of Lady Evelyn-Smoothwater Provincial Park from the Temagami Comprehensive Planning Area.<P>
 The WSA officially submits its Forest Stewardship Plan, and the government directs the CPC to incorporate it into the comprehensive plan.<P>

The Teme-Augama Anishnabai withdraw from the CPC, pending the resolution of outstanding concerns with the government.</TD></TR>

<TR VALIGN="TOP">
<TD WIDTH="25%">
<B>June 1995:</B></TD><TD>		The CPC releases an update on its comprehensive plan, and circulates a single, comprehensive land use map that attempts to show how the many competing demands on the Temagami-area resources can be accommodated.</TD></TR>

Description of Land-Use Zones<BR>
in the Temagami Comprehensive Planning Area



</B></CENTER><P><BR>

The government has established four land-use zones in the Temagami Comprehensive Planning Area.  These four zones, together with provincial parks, form the basis for future land-use in the Temagami area.  The land-use zones reflect seven years of public consultation on appropriate land-use in the Temagami area, and are designed to ensure that the needs of all resource users -- both recreational and commercial -- can be accommodated, while ensuring that significant ecological and other natural resource values are protected and managed.<P>

This fact sheet describes the four land-use planning zones in the Temagami Comprehensive Planning Area, as well as the seven provincial parks in the area.  It also outlines the purpose, allowable activities and access for each zone.<P>


<B>1.	Protected Areas</B><P>

<I>Description</I><P>

Protected Areas are land-use zones that include important ecological features such as representative old-growth red and white pine sites; the headwaters of rivers flowing through Lady Evelyn-Smoothwater Provincial Park; significant wetlands; provincially significant ecological and geological features; and significant recreational areas.<P>

<I>Purpose</I><P>

Protected Areas are designed to support the ecological integrity of the Temagami area's existing parks, and to recognize and protect areas that have natural heritage and remote recreation values.  Commercial activities such as timber harvesting and mining and aggregate extraction will not be allowed to take place in Protected Areas, and management plans will be developed to provide over-all direction and specific details on the use and management of each of the Protected Areas.<P>

<I>Allowable Activities/Access</I><P>

Commercial timber harvesting, mining and aggregate extraction are not permitted in Protected Areas.  The allowable land-uses in these zones focus on low-intensity, non-consumptive recreation and tourism -- to provide opportunities for activities such as fishing, hunting, trapping, snowmobiling, canoeing, hiking and cross-country skiing -- and on the protection of significant ecological values.  Prescribed fire will be considered as a method for managing habitat and maintaining natural ecosystems.
 Protected Areas will not generally be accessible by motorized vehicles, although crossings may be allowed.  Aircraft landings and snowmobile access will generally be permitted, but new commercial land-use permits or cottages will not be allowed.<P><BR>


<B>2.	Special Management Areas</B><P>


<I>Description</I><P>

Special Management Areas are land-use zones that have value for resource extraction, as well as existing and potential tourism and recreation opportunities.  Controlling access to these zones will ensure that these values are protected and managed appropriately.<P>


<I>Purpose</I><P>

Special Management Areas will be subject to carefully planned access, to accommodate a variety of land-uses, and to reduce the potential for resource user conflicts.  These zones will provide the public with access to remote hunting, fishing and tourism opportunities, such as remote, "back-country" hiking or canoeing.  In addition, the zones will allow companies to undertake resource extraction and other commercial activities, under carefully planned conditions of access.<P>

Special Management Areas will protect existing tourism infrastructure, while also providing new economic development opportunities -- such as the creation of new trails for snowmobilers, cross-country skiers and hikers, packaged fly-in "eco-tours," and other forms of low-impact, "back-country" recreation.<P>

Special Management Areas will also enable resource managers to identify and protect significant values that need to be managed by special prescriptions, such as the Lake Temagami Skyline Reserve, the North Lady Evelyn River headwaters, the Makobe River headwaters and the Montreal River wetlands.  Planned access to these zones will also facilitate the protection of self-sustaining fisheries and indigenous wildlife populations.<P>


<I>Allowable Activities/Access</I><P>

Special Management Areas are designed to allow and encourage remote recreation and tourism opportunities.  Resource extraction and development will also be permitted in these zones, but will be carefully managed to ensure that the activities are compatible with other significant uses and values in the area.  This will be accomplished through access controls and area-of-concern planning done as part of the Forest Management Planning process.
 Access to Special Management Areas will be carefully planned to provide users with a variety of remote and "back-country" recreational opportunities.  The public will have access to Special Management Areas by motorboat, canoe, trail (snowmobile, cross-country ski or hiking), aircraft, mountain bike, horse and ATV in existing locations, where resource features and values are not threatened.  Locations allowing the use of ATVs will be identified and designated as "Special Management Areas -- ATV Use."<P>

In some Special Management Areas -- such as the Lake Temagami Skyline Reserve and the Montreal River wetlands -- mineral exploration will be allowed, but commercial timber harvesting will not be permitted.  By contrast, in other zones -- such as the North Lady Evelyn River headwaters area -- commercial forestry will be permitted, subject to an approved management plan, but mining-related activities will not be allowed.  Special operating conditions will need to be developed for timber harvesting, mining and aggregate extraction operations in the Makobe River and the Anvil Lake-Willow Island Creek headwaters.<P>

Personal use permits for harvesting trees and using wood (e.g., fuel wood, dock-building material) will be considered in Special Management Areas, subject to the access planning for each area.  Mining-related activities in these zones will be controlled by existing provincial legislation, regulations and policy.<P><BR>


<B>3.	Integrated Management Areas</B><P>


<I>Description</I><P>

Integrated Management Areas are land-use zones in which resource management and development and recreational activities will be integrated, allowing commercial timber harvesting, mining and aggregate extraction to take place alongside recreational uses.<P>

In Integrated Management Areas, resource extraction and development will be carefully managed, to ensure that the activities are compatible with other significant uses and values in the area.  While some access controls may apply in these zones, there will likely be moderate to frequent contact between resource users.<P>

<I>Purpose</I><P>

Integrated Management Areas are designed to promote access to both tourism-related and resource extraction activities, while ensuring that these activities occur with a minimum of conflict between resource users.  These zones will allow a range of uses by a variety of resource users -- offering opportunities for both recreational and commercial activities, while facilitating the protection of significant ecological and other natural resource values.<P>

<I>Allowable Activities/Access</I><P>

Integrated Management Areas will provide access to "front-country" tourism and recreation activities, such as bear management areas, main-base lodges, canoe routes, portages and trails.<P>

Where timber harvesting occurs in an Integrated Management Area, there will be a need for aesthetic management on important roads, along lake shores, trails and near tourism establishments.  Appropriate measures will be described in the forest management plans.  Mining-related activities in these zones will be controlled by existing legislation, regulations and policy.<P>

Access to Integrated Management Areas will be less restrictive than in Protected Areas and Special Management Areas.  There will be few, if any, restrictions on road use, but no new or unplanned motorized public access to lakes will be permitted.  All access to Integrated Management Areas will be planned, and specific road use strategies will be developed to minimize user conflicts and protect resource values in each zone.<P>

Integrated Management Areas are designed to accommodate a higher intensity of fish and wildlife use and management.  For example, most easy-access, "put-and-take" fisheries will be located in these zones.  However, fisheries management and habitat protection will be emphasized through controls and/or access restrictions and regulations.  Fire management agreements may also be negotiated in Integrated Management Areas.<P><BR>


<B>4.	Developed Areas</B><P>


<I>Description</I><P>

Developed Areas are land-use zones that contain mainly privately-owned land, including agricultural land, but also include some Crown land.  While some privately-owned and developed land exists in other zones, Developed Areas are zones in which most of the land is developed, and where the natural and/or human environments have been significantly modified.<P>

<I>Purpose</I><P>

Developed Areas reflect the fact that land-use in some parts of the Temagami area -- particularly in and around towns and villages -- is subject to municipal control.  These zones recognize existing development, and will permit additional development to occur, while ensuring the protection of significant ecological and other values, and the sustainable management of natural resources on Crown land.<P>
<I>Allowable Activities/Access</I><P>

Developed Areas can sustain a mix of development activities, including commercial timber harvesting, mining and aggregate extraction, as well as "front-country" tourism and recreation facilities and related activities.  Where demand warrants, Developed Areas can also provide greater opportunities for utilizing Crown land for tourism-related activities, such as building new trail networks.<P>

Although mining-related hazards may exist in Developed Areas, provisions under the Mining Act ensure that rehabilitation takes place.  Resource extraction and development in Developed Areas will be carefully managed to ensure that the activities are compatible with other significant uses and values in the area.  Mining-related activities will be controlled by existing legislation, regulations and policy. <P>

In general, local municipalities are responsible for planning appropriate land-uses on patent lands within Developed Areas.  Some municipalities, for example, have restrictions that apply to hunting and fishing activities, and/or access controls on municipally-owned land.<P>

Cultural heritage protection, conservation and natural heritage protection are municipal responsibilities on municipally-owned land.  As well, the Planning Act requires municipalities to have regard for a range of provincial interests when they undertake local planning, including significant Crown resources.  The Crown Forest Sustainability Act also provides authority to harvest Crown timber on private lands, and an interim policy provides direction on licensing, scaling, work permits and Crown charges.<P>

In Developed Areas, fire suppression will be the immediate response to the occurrence of fire, and fire management agreements will be negotiated with individual municipalities.  Prescribed fire may also be considered and used for specific resource management purposes.<P>

Rehabilitation of fish and wildlife habitat will occur in Developed Areas, and access to Crown land in these zones will be planned.  Road use strategies will be developed to minimize conflicts between resource users and to ensure the protection of significant resource values.<P><BR>

<B>5.	Provincial Parks</B><P>

<I>Description</I><P>

There are seven provincial parks within the Temagami Comprehensive Planning Area -- one wilderness class park, four waterway class parks, and two recreation class parks:<P>

<I>Lady Evelyn-Smoothwater Provincial Park</I> is a 72,400-hectare wilderness class park whose significant features include the highest known point of land in Ontario.<P>

<I>Obabika River Provincial Park</I> was created as a 17,000-hectare waterway class park containing a diverse range of water-based recreation settings, with extensive shoreline concentrations of old-growth red and white pine forests.  In 1996, the government confirmed that it is adding a 3,520-hectare area to the park to protect the Obabika River North old-growth red and white pine forest, bringing the park's total area to 20,520 hectares.<P>

<I>Makobe-Grays Provincial Park</I> is a 1,427-hectare waterway class park encompassing the Makobe River at its point of departure from Lady Evelyn-Smoothwater Provincial Park, north to the Town of Elk Lake.<P>

<I>Solace Provincial Park</I> is a 5,943-hectare waterway class park consisting of several small lake environments connected by small portages.<P>

<I>Sturgeon River Provincial Park</I> is a 3,350-hectare waterway class park consisting of a riverine system typical of many in the Canadian Shield.<P>

<I>Finlayson Point Provincial Park</I> is a 37-hectare recreation class park on the shore of Lake Temagami, one kilometre south of the Village of Temagami.<P>

<I>W.J.B. Greenwood Provincial Park</I> is a 465-hectare recreation class park site (currently undeveloped) on the south shore of Bay Lake, two kilometres south of the Town of Latchford.<P>

<I>Purpose</I><P>

The goal of Ontario Parks is to provide a variety of outdoor recreation opportunities, and to protect provincially significant natural, cultural and recreational environments in a system of parks.  This goal is supported by the four objectives of protection, heritage appreciation, recreation and tourism.<P>
<I> Allowable Activities/Access</I><P>

The activities allowed in provincial parks are governed by the Provincial Parks Act, appropriate provincial park policies established by the Ministry of Natural Resources, and by existing and future management plans developed for each park.<P>

Conserving Old-growth Red and White Pine Forest Ecosystems<BR>
in the Temagami Comprehensive Planning Area

</B></CENTER><P><BR>
<B>Old-growth Red and White Pine Forests in Temagami</B><P>

One of the special features of the Temagami Comprehensive Planning Area is the presence of old-growth red and white pine forest ecosystems.  Today's old-growth red and white pine forests occur within a relatively narrow band that runs across central Ontario, from the Temagami area in the east to the shores of Lake Superior, as well as in some parts of northwestern Ontario.<P>

In its report to the government, the Comprehensive Planning Council (CPC) expressed support for MNR's approach to protect and conserve old-growth red and white pine forest resources.  The council also proposed a strategy for managing Temagami's red and white pine stands for old-growth characteristics.  The Minister of Natural Resources has accepted the CPC's recommendation that more must be done to inform and educate the public about old-growth forests, and that this should be done during the forest management planning process.<P>

<B>Protecting Temagami's Old-growth Forests</B><P>

During the late 1980s, much of the focus on old-growth forests in Temagami was on the Obabika Lake North Old-growth site.  In 1996, the Government of Ontario has protected this site by expanding the boundaries of Obabika River Provincial Park.  (For further information, please see the fact sheet on the Obabika Lake North Old-Growth Red and White Pine Forest.)<P>

The CPC recommended protection for 44 per cent of the old-growth red and white pine area in the Temagami Comprehensive Planning Area.  Preliminary work by the Ministry of Natural Resources in identifying areas of concern for additional protection has raised the old-growth red and white pine area being protected in Temagami to 52 per cent.  Through its forest management and other land use planning activities, MNR has a provincewide track record of a 65-per-cent level of protection for old-growth red and white pine forests.  Using this as a guideline, the ministry expects that Temagami's old-growth red and white pine forest areas will ultimately achieve this rate of protection.<P>

The Ministry of Natural Resources is implementing a provincewide conservation strategy designed to conserve Ontario's old-growth red and white pine forest ecosystems.  Fundamental to this strategy is the principle that representative ecosystems in the natural range of Ontario's old-growth pine forests constitute a valuable part of the province's natural heritage, and must be protected for future generations.
 MNR's old-growth conservation strategy was developed from recommendations of the Old Growth Forests Policy Advisory Committee.  The goal of the strategy is to ensure that red and white pine forest ecosystems -- including old-growth -- continue to be present now and in the future.  The strategy also includes forest protection and landscape management objectives.<P>

Under the strategy, old-growth pine forests are identified as representative and protected for future generations.  MNR uses a complex range of factors -- including the age of the trees, species associations, diversity, lack of disturbance, stocking, size and integrity -- to assess each old-growth site and determine the methods for protecting or managing the resources.  Around each old-growth site identified as representative, the ministry establishes ecological unit boundaries that take into account the site's natural and cultural heritage, tourism and recreation values.<P>

The Crown Forest Sustainability Act requires that all forest resources in Ontario be managed sustainably, under the provisions of specific forest management plans developed with broad public consultation.  Forest management in Ontario is also subject to the provisions of Environmental Assessment Act.<P>

<B>Restoring Nature's Balance</B><P>

Ontario's strategy for conserving old-growth pine forest ecosystems ensures that this important resource will exist into the future.  Modern silvicultural approaches, such as the shelterwood and seed tree systems, ensure that sufficient seed and good seed beds are available for red and white pine to regenerate after harvesting.<P>

Clear-cutting is not an allowable harvesting approach in old-growth red and white pine forests in the Temagami area.  The shelterwood approach guides commercial operators in adopting special techniques during the harvest and site preparation of old-growth pine forests.  In part, these techniques are designed to re-create the conditions in a forest after a major fire -- conditions which red and white pine trees find ideal for natural regeneration.<P>

A number of techniques are used to ensure that many of the special characteristics of old-growth forests -- including the presence of "super canopy trees," and older, declining and dead trees -- remain present on the site after harvesting.  The techniques allow areas of old-growth forest to be harvested, while providing many of the habitat requirements for the development of another old-growth forest in the future.
 In some areas, efforts to encourage natural pine regeneration are supplemented by planting.  When available, cones from felled old-growth red and white pines are collected and the seeds used to produce new pine seedlings.  The seedlings are planted in areas that originally supported old-growth stands -- giving the young trees a head start on a long and healthy life, and increasing the likelihood that they will one day form part of a thriving Crown pine forest.<P>

Lake Obabika North Old-growth Forest

</B></CENTER><P><BR>
Temagami's Lake Obabika North area served to focus attention in Ontario on old-growth red and white pine forest ecosystems.  In June 1996, the Minister of Natural Resources confirmed that the government is adding a 3,520-hectare area to Obabika River Provincial Park, to protect the old-growth forest red and white pine site.<P>

Protection of the Lake Obabika North old-growth site is part of a provincial conservation strategy for old-growth red and white pine forest ecosystems being implemented by the Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR).  This conservation strategy will ensure that all generations continue to enjoy these important resources.<P>

The province will accomplish its conservation goals by setting aside selected old-growth red and white pine areas for protection, and by managing others to enable them to retain their old-growth characteristics during sustainable forest management.<P><BR>

<B>A Valuable Resource</B><P>

The Lake Obabika North old-growth red and white pine forest is located on an upland, broken-sandy-till plain landform.  The site is the best representative old-growth red and white pine-dominated conifer and mixed forest on this landform in the Temagami area.  The forest was first identified in the Iles report of 1990, which detailed the results of a study designed to provide an inventory of old-growth red and white pine stands in the area.<P>

The Lake Obabika North old-growth site contains trees that are 130 to 300 years old.  Tree height and diameter varies over the site, with a maximum height of 30 metres and diameter of 75 centimetres.  Typical characteristics of old-growth forests include large live trees, standing dead tree snags and fallen logs on the forest floor.  Other notable features include large live trees with old fire scars, and younger seedlings and sapling pine that indicate the ecological role of recurring forest fires in maintaining conditions for the regeneration of the forest.  Much of the Lake Obabika North pine forest shows no sign of having ever been disturbed.
 The Lake Obabika North old-growth red and white pine forest supports a healthy mix of other tree species -- as well as the Temagami area's highest concentration of old-growth red and white pine -- and is important to the Aboriginal people living in the area.<P>

The forest landscape is quite distinctive, with extensive cliff and talus slopes, cold seepage springs and bogs.  The high relief associated with the area and the undisturbed old pine landscape of the ridges and hillsides contribute to its aesthetic quality.  Much of the area selected for protection has been identified as a provincially significant Area of Natural and Scientific Interest (ANSI).<P><BR>

<B>Size and Location</B><P>

Obabika River Provincial Park's original area was about 17,000 hectares.  In 1996, the government confirmed that it is adding 3,520 hectares to the park, specifically to protect the Lake Obabika North old-growth site, which occupies parts of Shelburne and Delhi Townships, at the north end of Obabika Lake, and extends west from the lake along the Obabika River, north to Wakimika Lake, and east to Bob Lake.<P><BR>


<B>Allowable Activities/Access</B><P>

A range of recreation- and tourism-oriented activities will be allowed in this provincially protected old-growth area.  Such activities can include wildlife viewing, fishing, hunting and camping, as well as other forms of low-impact recreation.  Scientific research, environmental monitoring and outdoor education will also be encouraged.<P>

To ensure that the area's natural values are protected, commercial timber harvesting, mining and mineral exploration, hydroelectric development, new road construction and other industrial activities will not be allowed.  Access to the site, which is on one of Ontario's most popular canoe routes, will generally be by canoe or boat.<P>

Detailed planning for the Lake Obabika North old-growth area will be done as part of the development of the provincial park management plan.<P>

Provincial Parks<BR>
in the Temagami Comprehensive Planning Area


</B></CENTER><P><BR>

The goal of Ontario Parks is to provide a variety of outdoor recreation opportunities, and to protect provincially significant natural, cultural and recreational environments in a system of parks.  This goal is supported by the four objectives of protection, heritage appreciation, recreation and tourism.<P>

Provincial parks offer a high level of protection for natural resources and other significant ecological and heritage values.  Access to parks is carefully controlled, and management plans are developed for each park with public input to set the park's overall direction and appropriate activities that can take place within it.  Mining, mineral exploration and commercial timber harvesting are not allowed in provincial parks.<P>

There are seven provincial parks in the Temagami area:
<UL>
<LI><I>Lady Evelyn-Smoothwater Provincial Park</I> is a 72,400-hectare wilderness class park.  The park was created in 1983 and, as a wilderness class park, offers the highest available level of resource protection within the provincial park system.  Lady Evelyn-Smoothwater's significant features include the highest known point of land in Ontario, and the park supports a diverse mix of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems -- including the original habitat of the endangered Aurora Trout, and several Brook Trout and Lake Trout communities.  Wetlands, upland meadows, rock lands and forest and plant species typical of the transition zone between the Boreal and the Great Lakes Forest Regions are found across the park.<P>

Although Lady Evelyn-Smoothwater was created as a wilderness class park, several non-conforming activities -- such as hunting, trapping and mineral exploration and development -- were initially allowed to continue.  For several years after the park was created, the Liskeard Lumber Road continued to be used for both timber hauling and recreational access.  However, in May 1988, the Government of Ontario decided to eliminate these non-conforming uses from all provincial parks.  The Liskeard Lumber Road was closed to timber hauling by the end of 1991.  Motorized use of the road for recreational access is still permitted, but a gate closure is enforced for the core of the park between June 15 and September 15.  All current activities and uses in the park will be reviewed during the development of the park's management plan, which is currently being prepared.  This  process will determine the extent to which non-conforming uses will be permitted in the future through consultation with affected stakeholders and communities.<P>

<LI><I>Obabika River Provincial Park</I> is a waterway class park with an original area of about 17,000 hectares.  The park contains a diverse range of water-based recreation settings, with extensive shoreline concentrations of old-growth red and white pine forests.  In 1996, the government confirmed that it is adding 3,520 hectares to the park to protect the Lake Obabika North old-growth forest stand, bring the total park area to 20,520 hectares.  (For further information on old-growth forest stand protection, please refer to the following fact sheets:  Conserving Old-Growth Red and White Pine Forest Ecosystems in the Temagami Comprehensive Planning Area; and  Lake Obabika North Old Growth Red and White Pine Forest.)<P>

<LI><I>Makobe-Grays Provincial Park</I> is a 1,427-hectare waterway class park encompassing the Makobe River at its point of departure from Lady Evelyn-Smoothwater Provincial Park north to the Town of Elk Lake.  Regulated as a provincial park in 1985, the Makobe River is swift in the spring, when the water flow is controlled by the surrounding geology, but becomes a small-stream waterway by the summer.<P>


<LI><I>Solace Provincial Park</I> is a 5,943-hectare waterway class park consisting of several small lake environments connected by small portages.  Jack pine and white birch are the park's dominant forest species, and some of its lakes support self-sustaining Lake Trout populations.<P>

<LI><I>Sturgeon River Provincial Park</I> is a 3,350-hectare waterway class park, and is a river system typical of many found in the Canadian Shield.  The free-flowing system consists of rapids that pass over bedrock sills and narrows that separate small-lake widenings.<P>

<LI><I>Finlayson Point Provincial Park</I> is a 37-hectare recreation class park on the shore of Lake Temagami, one kilometre south of the Village of Temagami.  The oldest provincial park in the Temagami area, Finlayson Point was created in 1963, and serves the demand for car camping from regional travellers on Highway 11.  The park contains 114 campsites nestled in a distinctive forest setting of large-diameter, old-growth red and white pine trees.<P>

<LI><I>W.J.B. Greenwood Provincial Park</I> is a 465-hectare recreation class park on the south shore of Bay Lake, two kilometres south of the Town of Latchford.  The park was regulated in 1986, and protects early successional white birch forest, scattered stands of white and red pine, and stands of sugar maple and yellow birch.  Although existing demand from car-based campers is currently well served along Highway 11, the park may be suitable for the future development of trails and boat-in camping to promote increased tourism and recreation in the Temagami area.
</UL><P><BR>


<B> Resource Protection</B><P>

The four waterway class parks in the Temagami area -- Makobe-Grays, Obabika, Solace and Sturgeon River -- interconnect with Lady Evelyn-Smoothwater Provincial Park.  Collectively, they protect a network of outstanding natural and cultural heritage features, including:
<UL>
<LI>90 kilometres of cold water streams;
<LI>seven major self-sustaining Lake Trout lakes and other lakes that sustain Brook Trout populations;
<LI>the most northerly sugar maple forest in the eastern part of the 4E Site-Region;
<LI>some of the best examples of old-growth forest stands in the Temagami area, including red and white pine-dominated communities;
<LI>ancient Aboriginal travel routes, including portages, campsites and sacred sites, such as Maple Mountain;
<LI>a network of historic fire towers; and
<LI>remote camping in highly attractive settings.
</UL><P><BR>

<B>Economic Impact</B><P>

Back-country recreation, commercial fly-in operations and guided wilderness travel through Lady Evelyn-Smoothwater and the connecting waterway class parks make a strong contribution to tourism in the Temagami area.  A recent study estimates total back-country recreation use of the area's parks and Crown land at 60,000 user-days per annum.<P><BR>


<B>Management Status</B><P>

The operation of provincial parks is subject to individual park management plans, which are developed with public consultation.  The Ministry of Natural Resources approved a management plan for Finlayson Point Provincial Park in 1985, and the park plan is currently under review.  Management plans are currently being prepared for the six other provincial parks in the Temagami area, and these should be completed by the spring of 1998.<P>

<B>Lands Set Aside Pending Resolution<BR>
of Temagami-area Aboriginal Land Claims
</B></CENTER><P><BR>
<B>Background</B>
<UL>
<LI>In 1885, pursuant to the Robinson Huron Treaty of 1850, the federal government surveyed land known as the Austin Bay Tract, on the south-east side of Lake Temagami, as a potential reserve for Aboriginal people living in the area.  The area surveyed comprised 65 square miles.  However, the provincial government of the day did not agree to the creation of the proposed reserve, and the Austin Bay Tract remains provincially owned Crown land today.<P>

<LI>In 1971, an official Reserve was established for the Temagami First Nation on Bear Island in Lake Temagami.  The area of the reserve is one square mile.  However, the Aboriginal people living in the area continue to claim a much larger area.<P>

<LI>In 1973, in order to advance a claim to ownership of their traditional territory, comprising 4,000 square miles, the Teme-Augama Anishnabai -- or TAA, which represents the Temagami First Nation and other Aboriginal people in the area -- filed formal land cautions with the Registrar of Titles on the 4,000 square-mile area, involving 110 geographic townships in and around the Temagami area.<P>

<LI>The land caution did not affect commercial forestry operations, but prevented the staking of new mining claims and new tourism-related economic development.<P>

<LI>In 1993, the Government of Ontario and the Teme-Augama-Anishnabai negotiated an Agreement-in-Principle designed to settle the outstanding land claim.  However, the Agreement-in-Principle was not ratified by the local Aboriginal people.<P>

<LI>During the negotiations for the Agreement-in-Principle, two categories of land were proposed:<P>
<UL>
<LI>land that would be under the sole jurisdiction and management of the Aboriginal people; and
<LI>land that would be managed under joint stewardship of the Aboriginal people and the provincial government.
</UL><P>
<LI>Working through the courts, the provincial government succeeded in 1995 in having the land caution removed on the 110 townships in and around the Temagami area.  The government will open most of the Crown land in the former caution area to staking under the Mining Act.<P>



<LI>Within the former caution area, there are a number of long-standing mining claims and mining leases, but the land caution prevented the owners of the claims and/or leases from actively working on the site.
</UL><P><BR>




<B>Ontario's Approach</B><P>
<UL>
<LI>The Government of Ontario is setting aside a significant area of land in the Temagami area to provide new economic development opportunities for local Aboriginal people, and to facilitate the settlement of the Teme-Augama Anishnabai land claim.<P>

<LI>The area being set aside contains the land in the Austin Bay Tract, and other lands that would have been under the sole jurisdiction of Aboriginal people under the non-ratified Agreement-in-Principle of 1993.  The government anticipates that some or all of the set-aside land could figure in the settlement of the outstanding land claim.<P>

<LI>The set-aside lands, while remaining Crown land, will not be opened to staking under the Mining Act, and the provincial government will make no new development or resource commitments on this land without the consent of the Temagami First Nation or the TAA.  Any of the land that does not figure in the settlement of the TAA's land claim will revert to the Crown's administrative jurisdiction, and will be managed according to the land-use recommendations for the Temagami Comprehensive Planning Area as put forward by the Comprehensive Planning Council, and as they may be amended by Ontario.
</UL><P><BR>


<B>Implementation</B><P>
<UL>
<LI>Existing mining claims and leases on Crown land in the former caution area -- except for those lands within the area to be set aside for settlement of the Aboriginal land claim -- will be honored, and the province will uphold the legal right of the claim owners and leaseholders to explore and develop their mining rights.<P>

<LI>The set-aside area will not be included in the land base used to calculate the Maximum Allowable Depletion (MAD) for the Temagami Management Unit forest management plan.<P>

<LI>Economic development opportunities on the set-aside land -- such as forestry, mining or land disposition -- will be subject to recommendations from the Chief and Council of the Temagami First Nation, and the Chief and Executive Council of the Teme-Augama Anishnabai.  The Crown's representatives for receiving such recommendations will be the ministries of Natural Resources and Northern Development and Mines.<P>


<LI>Any development that ultimately occurs on the set-aside lands will be governed by applicable provincial laws, policies and regulations.  For example, any new forestry activities would require an amendment to the existing Temagami Management Unit Forest Management Plan.<P>

<LI>In determining appropriate recommendations for the set-aside lands, the Ontario government will encourage Aboriginal representatives to consider maximizing the economic benefits to the members of their communities.
<LI>The government has proposed setting aside these lands in the Temagami area for a two-year period, to facilitate the resolution of the Aboriginal land claim.  If a land claim settlement has not been reached by the end of this period, the government will review the status of the lands.

<TITLE>Temagami Land Use Zones Map</TITLE>

<!-- Date: Friday, June 28, 1996  2:52 PM -->

</HEAD>

<BODY BGCOLOR = "FFFFFF">

<CENTER><IMG SRC="temagas.gif"></CENTER><P><BR>
To view this map in greater detail, click <A HREF="map2.html">here</A>.<P><BR>
	
<CENTER><H2>Summary of Land Use Zones in the Temagami 
Comprehensive Planning Area</H2></CENTER><P>
There are four land use zones in the Temagami Comprehensive Planning Area.  These four zones, together with provincial parks, form the basis for future land use in the Temagami area.  This fact sheet summarizes the rationale and purpose of the four land use zones and provincial parks in the area, and lists common planning elements that apply to all zones.<P><BR>


<H3>Temagami-area Land Use Zones</H3><P>

<B>Protected Areas.</B>  In Protected Areas, no commercial timber harvesting, mining or aggregate extraction will be permitted.  Land use will focus on low-intensity, non-consumptive recreation and tourism, and on the protection of significant ecological values, with allowable activities such as fishing, hunting, snowmobiling, canoeing, hiking and cross-country skiing.<P>

<B>Special Management Areas.</B>  In Special Management Areas, access will be carefully planned, and resources will be managed to ensure that significant values are protected.  Remote recreation and tourism will continue to be allowed and encouraged.  Resource extraction and related development will also be permitted, but will be carefully managed to ensure that the activities are compatible with other significant uses and values in the area.  This will be accomplished through access controls and area-of-concern planning done as part of the Forest Management Planning process.  Within Special Management Areas, sub-zones have been created to permit access by all-terrain vehicles (ATVs).  Some Special Management Areas may allow timber harvesting but not mining, while others may permit mineral exploration but not timber harvesting.<P>

<B>Integrated Management Areas.</B>  In Integrated Management Areas, there will be fewer restrictions on public access for recreation and resource management/extraction activities, and both types of activities will be permitted.  Resource extraction and related development will be carefully managed in Integrated Management Areas to ensure that the activities are compatible with other significant uses and values within the area.<P>

<B>Developed Areas.</B>  Developed Areas contain mainly privately-owned land, including agricultural land, but also include Crown land.  Resource extraction and related development will be permitted on Crown land within Developed Areas, but the activities will be carefully managed to ensure that they are compatible with other significant uses and values in the area.  Mining activity on privately-owned land is subject to the provisions of the Mining Act, and other relevant legislation.<P><BR>


<H3>Provincial Parks</H3>

There are seven provincial parks within the Temagami Comprehensive Planning Area - one wilderness class park, four waterway class parks, and two recreation class parks.  Wilderness parks offer the highest level of protection of resources and other ecological values, and have more restrictions on access and use.  The activities allowed in provincial parks are governed by the Provincial Parks Act, by appropriate provincial park policies established by the Ministry of Natural Resources, and by existing and future management plans developed for each park.<P><BR>

<H2>Raccoon Rabies -- The Facts</H2>
</CENTER>

<B>What is raccoon rabies?</B><P>

It is a strain of rabies spread mainly by raccoons, and is carried in the animal's saliva.  Humans and other animals can become infected through a cut or scratch from an animal with rabies, or if the rabies virus comes in contact with the moist tissues of the mouth, nose or eyes..<P>

<B>At present, raccoon rabies is not found in Ontario.</B><P>

Although Ontario raccoons have occasionally been infected with rabies, it has been with the arctic fox strain.  This type of rabies has been present in Ontario since the 1950s.<P>

Before the Ministry of Natural Resources initiated rabies control in 1989, about 2,000 rabid animals were confirmed in Southern Ontario each year.  On average, fewer than 20 of them were raccoons.  To date, no raccoon in Ontario has ever been detected as having the raccoon strain of rabies.<P>

<B>Where is raccoon rabies and why should we care about it?</B><P>

Raccoon rabies was first noted in Florida in the 1940s.  It has been travelling slowly northward toward Ontario since then.  It is well established on the New York side of the Niagara River and cases have been reported close to the St. Lawrence River near Gananoque.  <P>  

Ontario has a large raccoon population, especially in urban areas.  This is why it is important for Ontarians living in urban areas to understand raccoon rabies and how to protect themselves and their families against the disease.<P>


	
<B>Is raccoon rabies different from other strains of rabies?</B><P>

No. Raccoon rabies kills raccoons, other animals and humans in the same way as other strains of rabies do.  The only difference is that it is spread primarily by raccoons<P>

<B>What can people do to prevent exposure to raccoon rabies?</B><P>

People can protect themselves and their pets from raccoon rabies in the same way they protect themselves from other strains.  You should vaccinate your pets, avoid stray or wild animals, and call your doctor if you think you may have been in contact with a rabid animal.<P>

There are precautions and protective measures that have been succesful in Ontario for many years.  Please see other fact sheets in this series for more information.<P>

<B>What treatment is available against rabies?</B><P>

All people who are knowingly exposed to rabies must be treated immediately.  This treatment usually consists of a series of five injections given over a one-month period.  The treatment is safe and effective.  No human death has been directly linked to raccoon rabies.  The last reported death in Ontario from any strain of rabies was in 1967.<P>

<H2> Rabies -- Protecting Your Family and Your Pets</H2>
</CENTER>



Raccoon rabies is a strain of rabies spread mainly by raccoons.<P>

<B>At present, raccoon rabies is not found in Ontario.</B>  However, it is just like any other rabies strain. You can protect your family and your pets from any rabies strain by observing the following rules:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Have your pets vaccinated according to instructions from your veterinarian.

<LI>Warn your children to stay away from wild or stray animals.

<LI>Raccoon-proof your home.  You may want to contact a professional for advice, or raccoon-proof your home yourself.

<LI>Take measures to discourage wild animals from taking up residence in your home or on your property.  For example, cover up potential entrances, such as uncapped chimneys, loose shingles and openings in attics, roofs and eaves.  (See Fact Sheet "Discourage Raccoons From Moving In.")

<LI>Do not attempt to trap raccoons which are causing damage to your property.  Instead, contact a professional animal control officer to remove nuisance raccoons.

<LI>Do not trap and transport nuisance raccoons to a new location.  You could help spread the disease.

<LI>Do not keep wildlife, including raccoons, as pets.  It is against the law.

<LI>Report any animals behaving strangely to your local animal control office.


<LI>Don't touch dead or sick animals.  

<LI>If you think any member of your family has been in contact with a rabid animal, immediately call your doctor or go to your local emergency care centre.

<H2>Recognizing the Symptoms of Raccoon Rabies</H2>
</CENTER>

<B>What is raccoon rabies?</B><P>
	
It is a strain of rabies spread primarily by raccoons.<P>

<B>At present, raccoon rabies is not found in Ontario.</B><P>

Raccoon rabies, like all strains of rabies, is a viral disease carried in an animal's saliva.  Humans and other animals can be infected by a rabid animal through a cut or scratch, or through contact with the moist tissues of the mouth, nose or eyes.<P>

<B>What are the symptoms of rabies?</B><P>

Rabies can manifest itself as "dumb" or "furious" rabies.<P>

In dumb rabies:
<UL>
<LI>some animals may become depressed and retreat to isolated places
<LI>wild animals, especially skunks, may lose their fear of humans
<LI>animals may show signs of paralysis such as abnormal facial expressions, drooping head, sagging jaw, or paralyzed hind limbs
</UL>
In furious rabies:
<UL>
<LI>animals may show extreme excitement and aggression
<LI>animals may gnaw and bite their own limbs
<LI>animals may attack stationary things or other animals
<LI>bouts of furious rabies usually alternate with periods of depression
</UL>



<B>How long does it take for an animal to get rabies after it is infected?</B><P>

The time between exposure to the virus and the onset of symptoms can range from about two weeks to many months.<P>

<B>Can animals have rabies without showing any symptoms?</B><P>

Yes.  The rabies virus can be found in animal saliva days before any obvious symptoms develop.  However, all animals that have the virus will develop symptoms and eventually die of the disease.<P>

<H2>Discourage Raccoons From Moving In
</H2>
</CENTER>
Wild animals belong in the wild.  For their protection and your own, they should not be allowed to take up residence inside or near your home.  <P>  

Although some mammals are more susceptible to some strains of rabies, any animal can be infected by any strain of rabies.  A strain not found Ontario and which is spread by raccoons, is approaching the province.  Those areas where Ontario is linked to New York State, such as the Niagara Region or at international bridges along the St. Lawrence are the most vulnerable.<P>

<B>Keep raccoons away</B><P>
<UL>
<LI>Do not provide food or shelter for raccoons or other wild animals.  It is against the law to keep wildlife, including raccoons, as pets.<P>

<LI>If your pet's food is usually left outside, bring it in at the end of the day.
</UL>
<B>Raccoon-proof your home</B><P>

You may want to contact a professional for advice, or raccoon-proof your home yourself:
<UL>
<LI><B>Cover up potential entrances</B>, such as uncapped chimneys, loose shingles and openings in attics, roofs and eaves.  If you're not sure where raccoons are getting in, sprinkle flour around potential entrances and check for footprints later.  You can also stuff a rag or ball of paper in a suspect hole and check later to see if it has been removed.<P>

<LI><B>Make a raccoon den unlivable.</B>  Sprinkle naphtha flakes around the area or hang ammonia-soaked cotton rags near the entrance and keep the area brightly lit.  Raccoons dislike loud noises, bright lights and strong smells.  Use the same methods in your garden or in the area where you keep your garbage or composter.<P>


<LI><B>Always cover composters and garbage cans.</B>  Use a bungie cord or a heavy weight to keep the lid in place.<P>

<LI><B>Make sure that all raccoons or other animals have left before sealing up holes in any part of a building. </B> This is especially important between May and July when there may be young.<P>

<LI><B>Block the entrances to a raccoon den</B> once you're sure all the animals have left.  You can use sheet metal.  Repair siding and holes in buildings, and use heavy rustproof screening to cover open air vents or chimneys.<P>

<LI><B>Trim all overhanging tree branches</B> or any other structure that animals might use to get on to the roof of a residence or detached building.

</CENTER>


<B>What is the TVR program?</B><P>

The TVR program is a preventive measure to protect raccoons in certain areas of the province against the spread of the raccoon strain of rabies.  The program is active in the Niagara Peninsula between the Niagara River and the Welland Canal and in the vicinity of bridge border crossings along the St. Lawrence River at Cornwall, Iroquois, Prescott and Gananoque.<P>

<B>Why is it necessary?</B><P>

It is necessary because of the approach of raccoon rabies from the United States.  Raccoon rabies is a strain of rabies carried primarily by raccoons.  At present, this strain is not found in Ontario but has been confirmed in raccoons, on the New York state side of the Niagara River and close to the St. Lawrence River near Gananoque.<P>

<B>How does the program work?</B><P>

With the assistance of local trappers hired for their expertise, Ministry of Natural Resources staff set out live-trap cages to catch raccoons without harming them.  The raccoons are then vaccinated against rabies, marked with ear-tags that will identify them as vaccinated, and released unharmed at the site where they were captured.<P>

In 1995, the program vaccinated 72.5 per cent of the raccoon population in the buffer zones in the Niagara Region and along the St. Lawrence River.  Trapping will continue this year, from June to November.<P>

Vaccinating a large number of raccoons in these areas against rabies will contain or slow the spread of the disease, should it move into Ontario along natural routes.<P>

<B>Where are traps placed?</B><P>

The traps are placed by Ministry of Natural Resources staff in any area that raccoons are known to inhabit, including private land.  The public can expect to see wildlife technicians setting cages and checking them within 24 hours for raccoons.<P>

<B>What happens if other animals, such as pets, are caught in the traps?</B><P>

Although other animals may inadvertently be caught, they cannot be harmed by the traps.  The cages are checked within 24 hours and any other animals will be released.  The public should not attempt to release any animal from these cages.<P>

<H2>If Raccoon Rabies is Confirmed in Ontario  
</H2>
</CENTER>

<B>What happens if a case of raccoon rabies is confirmed in Ontario?</B><P>

If a case of raccoon rabies is confirmed in Ontario, Ministry of Natural Resources staff will implement a point-control program near the point of discovery, in an effort to contain the disease and prevent it from spreading to the rest of Ontario's raccoons and other mammals.  This would be necessary only if a case occurs outside of treated areas in the Niagara Region and around the bridge border crossings along the St. Lawrence River where raccoons have been vaccinated against raccoon rabies.<P>  

<B>How does a point-control program work?</B><P>

In urban areas, the program involves humanely euthanizing the raccoon and skunk population within a two-kilometre radius of the confirmed case.  Within a further two-kilometre area raccoons and skunks will be vaccinated in order to create a buffer zone of inoculated animals.  In rural areas, all raccoons within a radius of four kilometres will be euthanized, and those within a further four-kilometre radius will be vaccinated.<P> 

The difference in area relates to how far the raccoons are likely to travel within a given period.  Urban raccoons inhabit a much smaller territory than raccoons living in less populated areas.<P>  

<B>Why is it necessary to euthanize some animals?</B><P>

Rabies takes some time to incubate.  Infected animals may not show symptoms of the disease for weeks.  By the time a case of raccoon rabies is confirmed, the disease likely has taken hold in the area and vaccination may no longer be an effective control in the immediate area.<P>

By humanely euthanizing raccoons in the area where a case is confirmed - as they are likely to be infected - and by vaccinating the surrounding raccoon population, the chances of eliminating the disease and preventing it from spreading are increased.<P>

<B>How does the vaccination program work?</B><P>

With the assistance of local trappers hired for their expertise, the Ministry of Natural Resources will set out live-trap cages to catch raccoons without harming them.  Cages are checked within 24 hours and trapped raccoons are vaccinated.  They are also marked with ear-tags so they can be identified as vaccinated and are released at the point of capture.<P>

<B>What role will the public play in this process?</B><P>

The public can follow the same preventive measures that are successful against any strain of rabies.  Vaccinate pets, warn children to stay away from wild or stray animals, and report any animal that behaves strangely to your local humane society, or police department.<P>

If you travel across the region, raccoons are known to "hitch a ride" on trucks and other vehicles.  There is a risk that rabies could be spread far into the province this way.  Before you begin your trip, or after a road-side stop, make sure that you have not "picked up" or are carrying raccoons in your vehicle.<P>

<H2>Contingency Planning in Ontario<BR>
A Community Response to the Threat of <BR>Raccoon Rabies
  
</H2>
</CENTER>
A strain of rabies, spread by raccoons, is advancing northward through New York state.  It may enter Ontario in 1996 unless widely co-ordinated protective actions are taken.  The Ontario Raccoon Rabies Task Force has put in place a strategic plan for countering this threat.  This includes leading a program of preventive action involving local organizations, the provincial government and the federal government.  The result of this preventive action are a series of raccoon rabies community contingency plans.<P>

<B>What is a community contingency plan?</B><P>

It is an action plan at the local level that will:
<UL>
<LI>help keep raccoon rabies out of Ontario
<LI>help contain an outbreak if it should occur
<LI>help people to protect themselves and their communities.
</UL>
	Using a model developed in the Niagara Region, the plan outlines where raccoon rabies might enter a community, who would be affected, who should be alerted first, what needs to be done quickly, who does what needs to be done and, finally, how the citizens are kept informed.<P>

<B>Who creates community contingency plans?</B><P>

	Local representatives from government and non-government agencies, companies and individuals that have an interest in raccoon rabies.  These may include: the local health unit, police department, clerk's office, animal control agency, humane society, wildlife rehabilitators, wildlife control companies (or local trappers' council) and the local offices of the ministries of Natural Resources; Health; Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs; and Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada.<P>

<B>Who can I talk to about my community's contingency plan?</B><P>

<H2>May is Rabies Awareness Month
</H2>
</CENTER>

May has been declared Rabies Awareness Month to help increase public knowledge of how to prevent and avoid rabies.  Local agencies are encouraged to promote this month so that people will be better able to protect themselves, their children and their pets.<P>

Southern Ontario once held the unhappy title of "Rabies Capital of North America."  In 1967, the Ontario and federal governments combined resources to ensure that research into the cause and spread of the disease went hand-in-hand with measures to protect the public.  Using an oral vaccine dropped from airplanes, the Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR) has been immunizing red foxes, the main carrier of rabies to livestock and pets, who may then pass on the disease to humans. <P> 
<B>Is the threat of rabies disappearing?</B><P> 
<UL>



<LI>Not yet.  Although Ontario is making progress in eliminating fox rabies, a variant of rabies spread by raccoons is moving quickly through the northeastern United States.  Unless it can be stopped, this type of rabies 	will spread into Ontario.<P> 
<LI>To create a protective barrier, MNR has inoculated raccoons against rabies in areas where diseased animals are most likely to enter Ontario.  Researchers are working to develop an oral vaccine for raccoons so that aerial vaccination could be used to eliminate the disease over large areas, if it were to reach Ontario.  It is important that people know what to expect so that they can take precautions against spreading the disease by unwittingly transporting racoons from outside Ontario into the province, or moving them around inside the province.<P> 
</UL>
<B>How can people protect themselves?</B><P> 
<UL>
<LI>Being aware of how you can protect yourself from rabies is your number-one defence.  You should vaccinate your pets, avoid stray or wild animals, and call your doctor and your local health unit if you think you may have been in contact with a rabid animal. 
<LI>Various government departments and the veterinary profession are working together in the fight against rabies.  They are members of a Raccoon Rabies Task Force which is helping communities throughout Ontario develop a local action plan for managing any localized raccoon rabies outbreak and to prevent it from spreading.  Several communities already have such a plan in place.

<H2>Controlling Fox Rabies in Ontario</H2>
</CENTER>

Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR) researchers believe they have found a way to stop wildlife rabies in its tracks.  If current trends continue, they expect that by the year 2001 they will have eliminated fox rabies from Ontario by air-dropping from one to two million vaccine-baits a year over southern Ontario.<P>

<B>Why should Ontario worry about rabies?</B><P>

The Arctic strain of fox rabies has been a serious and persistent problem in Ontario since 1959.  Until recently, southern Ontario had more reported cases of animal rabies than any other province or state in North America.  In the past, this has cost governments more than $6 million a year in diagnosis; investigation of reports of animal bites to see if rabies was involved; treatment of humans contacting rabid animals; compensation to farmers for loss of livestock; cost of quarantine and research.  Pet owners spend an additional $50 million a year having their pets vaccinated.  The last human death in Ontario due to fox rabies was in 1967.<P>

<B>How have we approached the problem?</B><P>

The Ministry of Natural Resources Rabies Unit, in conjunction with scientists from Connaught Laboratories and Queen's and McMaster universities and the universities of Toronto and Guelph, attacked rabies at its source: the red fox.  Research has centered on immunizing wild foxes.  Scientists now believe that if they are able to immunize a large enough percentage of the "carrier species" population that spreads rabies, the disease will die out completely.  <P>  

<B>Moving towards a solution</B><P>

Vaccinating wildlife on a large scale poses many challenges.  Several existing rabies vaccines work well when injected, but injecting wild foxes was out of the question.  An alternative was to deliver the vaccine orally, in a bait.  The rabies vaccine is a living virus and, therefore, quite delicate.  It has to be absorbed in the mouth, for if it were released in the stomach it would be destroyed.  Current baits contain 1.8 millilitres of rabies vaccine sealed in a small plastic blister-pack embedded in each one.<P>



Finding a vaccine bait that wouldn't be ignored by foxes was another challenge.  Not only must the bait be attractive for foxes to eat, it must be easy to mass produce, and easy to store, handle and distribute over large areas.  Most of all, researchers needed to ensure the blister pack of vaccine would be chewed along with the bait.  The successful bait is a mixture of fats, wax and flavoring.   <P>   

<B>Testing some answers</B><P> 

In 1989, after many years of small-scale studies, MNR researchers began a five-year trial in rabies control.  They started in a 30,000-square-kilometre area in rural eastern Ontario.  They chose an area large enough to prove that it was the bait program, and not simply a natural cycle, that would change the level of rabies.<P>
    
Every October, specially equipped ministry aircraft have dropped baits for the wild foxes at a density of 20 baits per square kilometre along flight lines spaced from 1.3 to 2 kilometres apart.  Three Twin Otters are outfitted with special bait-dispensing machines.  Navigation is done using the latest satellite and computer technology so that millions of baits are spread uniformly and at a predetermined density.  The number of baits delivered is computer controlled and carefully recorded.  This helps ensure a minimal number of baits are wasted.<P>

<B>How are we doing?</B><P>

A rabid fox has not been found in the region since September 1993.  From 1970 to 1989, the treated region had been averaging 385 cases of animal rabies a year.  By 1993, that had dropped to 16.  Of those 16, seven were bats, and one a fox infected with a bat strain of rabies.  Bats carry their own forms of rabies, and since bats in Ontario are small and insect-eating, they are not affected by the rabies vaccination program.<P>   

In 1993, the experimental program was expanded to the rest of the rabies zone in southern Ontario.  Rabies dropped to its lowest level in Ontario since 1961.  In 1995, three aircraft took 10 days to distribute 1.8 million baits over 84,000 square kilometres, thereby covering all of the rabies-affected area in southern Ontario.  Whereas Ontario had averaged 2000 cases of rabies per year during the 1980s, at the end of 1995, there were only 323.<P>

<B>Rabies in the city</B><P>

In Metropolitan Toronto (pop. 2.4 million), a city with extensive ravines, parklands, large red fox populations, and a history of rabies problems, rabies vaccine-baits are distributed by hand in the spring and in the fall. <P> 


<B>Skunks can spread rabies too</B><P>

Since 1987, the ministry has undertaken an experimental program to vaccinate skunks in a sector of the city (Scarborough) which had been experiencing a consistently, high incidence of skunk rabies.  Since the oral vaccine in a bait does not work for skunks, scientists developed a system (TVR) to live-trap, vaccinate by injection, and release the animals.  Only three cases have been diagnosed to date in that area since 1987, and none since 1990.<P>

<B>Raccoons and Rabies</B><P>

The raccoon strain of rabies has been moving northward in the United States for several years.  It is now established on the New York side of the Niagara River and within 10 kilometres of Gananoque on the St. Lawrence River.  Since raccoons were often attracted to the live traps set out for the skunk population in the Scarborough study, information was collected on raccoons captured in the traps for use at a later date.  This knowledge has been pivotal in the current strategy for keeping raccoon rabies out of Ontario.  In 1994, MNR immunized about 64 per cent of the raccoon population in the Niagara Region in an area between the Welland Canal and the Niagara River, with the intention of creating a buffer zone of protected raccoons at the point where the potential for a rabid raccoon to stray into Ontario is very high.  In 1995, scientists added new buffer zones along the St. Lawrence River to this program.  They also cooperated with a New York State experiment to airdrop an American-made vaccine against rabies for raccoons.  Ontario supported these efforts to stop raccoon rabies before it reaches the province.  MNR will continue to maintain Ontario's buffer zones of vaccinated raccoons in 1996.<P>


<B>Using what we are learning about rabies in foxes on raccoon rabies</B><P>

As part of the long-term strategy for wildlife rabies control, MNR's Rabies Research Unit has also tested and confirmed how many baits are needed to airdrop rabies vaccine to immunize a raccoon population.  They have found the flavor that raccoons prefer and expect to be able to use this method in about two to four years when a cost-effective oral rabies vaccine for raccoons becomes available. <P>

<H2>Cats - A Link With Rabies</H2>
</CENTER>

Why think about cats when it's fox and raccoon rabies we're facing in Ontario?<P>

While both foxes and raccoons are the primary carriers for those strains of rabies, cats provide a link for the transmission of rabies from foxes and raccoons to people.<P>

May is Rabies Awareness Month in Ontario and the Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR) and its partners want to increase public knowledge of how to avoid rabies.<P>  

The ministry's Rabies Research Unit has been working since 1989 to eliminate the fox strain through an aerial baiting program.  MNR expects to have eliminated fox rabies in Ontario by the year 2001.  Although there are no reported cases of the raccoon strain in Canada, it has slowly been working its way north through the United States and has now been found close to Ontario at the New York State border.  It could be a problem if it reaches Ontario, because the province has a large raccoon population.<P>

<B>The Trap-Vaccinate-Release Program</B><P>

Three of the most likely transmission routes by which infected racoons might enter the province are across the Niagara River, across the St. Lawrence River, or by accidental transport on trucks, trains, recreational vehicles or boats.<P>

The Rabies Research Unit has been working over the past few years to create a buffer zone against raccoon rabies between the Niagara River and the Welland Canal by immunizing raccoons through a trap-vaccinate-release (TVR) program.  In 1995, the ministry created additional zones at bridges along the St. Lawrence River, where infected raccoons could easily cross from New York State.<P>

The TVR program uses humane live-traps to catch raccoons.  The animals are vaccinated, then marked with an ear-tag and released.  The ministry hopes that by doing this, the spread of raccoon rabies can be contained or slowed if it comes into the province.<P>


										
<B>Protect your pets</B><P>

If raccoon rabies reaches Ontario, cats in the outbreak area present a potential risk to public safety because of their close association with both raccoons and people. <P>

Pet owners, and anyone who comes into contact with cats, should take steps to protect their pets and family.<P>

Many people keep their cats indoors during the day, but let them outside at night. This is when they are most likely to come into contact with raccoons, who also prowl at night.  Both often frequent the same areas.  Rabies experts encourage people to keep their cats confined or on a leash, especially during the evening.  In many municipalities, this is already mandatory.<P>

It is very important that pet owners make sure their cats (or dogs) have been vaccinated so they do not catch and pass on rabies. <P>

Most pet cats in Ontario are vaccinated.  However, there is also a problem with barn cats and feral cats (unowned cats who live in the wild). <P> 

Barn cats are usually very hard to catch, and therefore are not often vaccinated.  Wild cats present a special problem because they don't have  owners who can have them vaccinated.  The exact number of feral cats is unknown, but there are many who live throughout the province in rural areas, on farms and in cities.<P>
  
To make sure your pet cat is not mistaken for a feral cat, get it a collar so it can be identified as having had a vaccination.  A collar, or other means of identification should also have your telephone number on it.<P>

<B>Protect Yourself</B><P>

The best way to protect yourself, your family and your pets from all strains of rabies is to have your pets vaccinated, keep away from stray or wild animals, and call your doctor if you think you may have been in contact with a rabid animal.<P>

Humans and animals can become infected with rabies by saliva from a rabid animal coming into contact with a cut or scratch, or in contact with the moist tissues of the mouth, nose or eyes.<P>

Any direct contact with a wild animal needs to be taken seriously even if an animal appears to be healthy.  Rabies incubate in a raccoon for some time before symptoms appear.<P>

If you think you or a member of your family has been in contact with a rabid animal, wash the affected skin thoroughly with anti-bacterial soap and hot water and contact your doctor or local health department immediately.<P>

										.
Anyone who is exposed to rabies must be treated immediately.  Rabies is fatal if untreated.  The treatment which is safe and effective is usually a series of five injections given over a one-month period.<P>



<B>Detecting Rabies in Animals</B><P>

Rabid animals may become depressed and retreat to isolated places.  Wild animals, especially skunks, lose their fear of humans.  The animals may show signs of paralysis such as abnormal facial expressions, drooping heads, sagging jaws or paralysed hind limbs.<P>

Some animals may show extreme excitement and aggression.  They may gnaw and bite their own limbs, and may attack stationary objects or other animals.  Bouts of aggressive, rabies-induced behaviour often alternate with periods of exhaustion and depression.<P>

If you see an animal that is acting strangely, you should report it to your municipal animal control agency, humane society or the police.<P>

<CENTER><H2>True or False - A Quiz About Rabies</H2></CENTER><BR>

1. <B>A good way to avoid rabies is to avoid direct contact with all wild animals and with unfamiliar domestic animals.</B>

<FORM METHOD="text">  
<SELECT NAME="answer">
<OPTION>Answer here<OPTION>TRUE</SELECT>
</FORM>
Rabies virus is in the saliva of a rabid animal.  If the saliva enters your body by a bite or a scratch, or if it comes into contact with the moist tissues of your eyes, nose or mouth, you could probably get rabies.<BR> (ref. <A HREF="rab4.html">If You or a Family Member Has Been Exposed to Rabies</A>)<P><BR><BR>

2. <B>My cat can get rabies from a raccoon.</B><P>
<FORM METHOD="text">  
<SELECT NAME="answer">
<OPTION>Answer here<OPTION>TRUE</SELECT>
</FORM>
A rabid raccoon can give rabies to any mammal, including cats, dogs and people.  Even though cats are household pets, we sometimes forget to have them vaccinated against rabies.  They can then pass rabies on to us.<BR> (ref. <A HREF="rabiescat.html">Cats - A Link With Rabies</A>)<P><BR><BR>

3. <B>We can be sure that only if an animal is foaming at the mouth and attacks people it is rabid.</B>
<FORM METHOD="text">  
<SELECT NAME="answer">
<OPTION>Answer here<OPTION>FALSE</SELECT>
</FORM>
Even if rabies virus is already in the animal it takes time for damage to the brain to cause outward signs, such as the aggressive behaviour of "furious" rabies.  Some other symptoms of rabies might also be paralyzed hind legs which cause the animal to stagger or its head may droop (ref. <A HREF="rab3.html">Recognizing the Symptoms of Raccoon Rabies</A>).  Some rabid animals have no visibal symptoms at all.<P><BR><BR>   

4.<B>Raccoon rabies is not more dangerous than other kinds of rabies.</B>
<FORM METHOD="text">  
<SELECT NAME="answer">
<OPTION>Answer here<OPTION>TRUE</SELECT>
</FORM>
All types of rabies are very dangerous and you must get treatment if you suspect you or your pet have been in contact with a rabid animal.  Vaccination protects against all types of rabies.<BR> (ref. <A HREF="rab1.html">Raccoon Rabies -- The Facts</A>)<P><BR><BR>

5. <B>I can help protect myself against rabies by having my pet vaccinated regularly.</B>
<FORM METHOD="text">  
<SELECT NAME="answer">
<OPTION>Answer here<OPTION>TRUE</SELECT>
</FORM>
You should also avoid wild animals or strays and be sure to get medical help immediately if you think you may have been in contact with a rabid animal.  Unless cats or dogs have been identified as vaccinated against rabies, we can't be sure they're not rabid without special testing.<BR> (ref. <A HREF="rab1.html">Raccoon Rabies -- The Facts</A> and <A HREF="rab5.html">If You Suspect Your Family Pet Has Been Exposed To Rabies</A>)<P><BR><BR>




6. <B>An animal that has rabies can be saved by rabies vaccines.</B>

<FORM METHOD="text">  
<SELECT NAME="answer">
<OPTION>Answer here<OPTION>FALSE</SELECT>
</FORM>

An unvaccinated animal that has contracted rabies can't be saved.<BR> (ref. <A HREF="rab3.html">Recognizing the Symptoms of Raccoon Rabies</A>)<P><BR><BR>  

7. <B>A person who has been exposed to rabies has to get very painful treatment to survive.</B>
<FORM METHOD="text">  
<SELECT NAME="answer">
<OPTION>Answer here<OPTION>FALSE</SELECT>

<B>Hodgson Announces Measures to Restore Elk
</B>
</CENTER><P>
Natural Resources Minister Chris Hodgson today announced that the government will restore elk populations in Ontario.<P> 

"We want to bring elk back to Ontario," said Mr. Hodgson.  "This is a beautiful animal that was once native to much of the province. We are working with two committees to get elk restoration under way." .<P>

The two committees responsible for implementing the project are made up of representatives from interested groups and from government.  The elk restoration technical committee includes professional staff from the Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters, Parks Canada and MNR. This committee is coordinating the technical aspects of the project, including identification of potential release sites, animal care and post-release assessment.<P>

The elk restoration advisory committee includes representatives from Cambrian College, Safari Club International, the Northern Ontario Tourist Outfitters Association, the Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters, the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation, the Ontario Federation of Agriculture, the Ontario Fur Managers Federation, a French River tourist outfitter and MNR. This committee is  responsible for raising the almost $200,000 needed for research, project implementation, communications and community consultation.<P>

"I am really pleased to see this wide variety of interested groups pulling together for the betterment of wildlife in Ontario," 
Mr. Hodgson said.<P>

Elk disappeared from Ontario in the late 1800s because of overharvesting and changes in habitat. In the 1930s, in an effort to restore populations, elk from western Canada were introduced to several parts of the province.  Two small herds originating from that reintroduction effort still exist in the French River area south of Sudbury. Cambrian College and Laurentian University have been leading research on these herds to determine why they have not expanded over the years.<P> 

"This research will be extremely important in determining how best to proceed with the restoration program," said Mr. Hodgson.<P>

A short list of potential release sites will be finalized early this winter. Consultation with local communities and interested groups will then take place.<P>

Plans are being developed for a pilot release of 50 animals at one site during the early winter of 1998. Tentative arrangements have been made to obtain these animals from Elk Island National Park in Alberta.  The elks' ability to adapt to their new environment will be carefully monitored.  Future releases will be based on the outcome of this assessment program.<P>

"This restoration project is an important part of the government's commitment to rehabilitating the Ontario landscape by restoring populations of wildlife native to the province,"  Mr. Hodgson said.<P>

<B>Support For CWIP Continues, Says Hodgson
</B>
</CENTER><P>
The Ministry of Natural Resources provided $191,000 to fund volunteers working on 140 Community Wildlife Involvement Program (CWIP) projects across Ontario in 1996, announced Natural Resources Minister Chris Hodgson.<P>

"I am very pleased that MNR has been able to continue supporting this valuable wildlife program and I want to thank all the volunteers who donated their time and energy," said Hodgson.  "CWIP projects are grass-root efforts and they demonstrate the substantial contributions that dedicated individuals and groups are prepared to make to Ontario's wildlife."<P>

Examples of some projects undertaken in 1996 are the erection of osprey platforms by the Friends of Charleston Lake and wild turkey trapping and relocations performed by the South-Central Big Game Association.  Other types of CWIP projects undertaken this year include habitat rehabilitation, tree planting, nesting box construction, clover seeding and wild rice planting.<P> 

Under the CWIP program, MNR provides start-up money and technical expertise to organized volunteers after their wildlife project is approved by the ministry.  This start-up money is primarily used for purchasing materials and supplies while a group or individual provides all the labour to complete the project.<P>

To qualify for CWIP funding, a project must meet one or more of the following objectives:<P>
<UL>
<LI>increased variety, abundance and distribution of Ontario's wildlife and wildlife habitat
<LI>increased knowledge of Ontario's wildlife resources
<LI>stronger relations between landowners, outdoor recreationists and interest groups.
</UL>
Funding for CWIP projects now comes from the special account established last year by MNR to support fish and wildlife management activities using revenue collected from fish and wildlife licence fees, royalties and fines.<P>

Interested groups or individuals should contact their local MNR District Office for further information on the program or projects in their area.<P>

<B>Hodgson Announces Conservation Tax Improvements
</B>
</CENTER><P>
"Tax reforms that promote the environmental stewardship of private forest land and conservation lands will be permanently worked into the property-tax process," Natural Resources Minister Chris Hodgson announced today.<P>

"These changes fulfil our promise to improve the property-tax system to promote better management of private woodlands and the protection of Ontario's natural heritage," said Hodgson.  "Property taxes will be reformed so that there is a long-term commitment to support landowners who protect and conserve their woodlands and significant natural heritage areas."<P>

"These reforms will lead to better stewardship of Ontario's forests, which the international marketplace demands," said Hodgson.  "Through these reforms, Ontario can keep its markets open, which is good for the economy and creating jobs."<P>

These measures follow Hodgson's announcement last year of the reinstatement of the Managed Forest Tax Rebate, an interim measure that was first created in 1975 but terminated in 1993 by the former NDP government, which had other spending priorities.<P>

The changes today are part of the government's response to the tax recommendations of the Who Does What committee.  The changes are consistent with both the government's commitment to replace interim property-tax rebates with long-term tax reforms that recognize the importance of environmental protection and the proposals contained in the report of the Mike Harris Task Force on Rural Economic Development.  The changes will go into effect in the 1998 tax year.<P>

Under the changes, the Managed Forest Tax Rebate Program and the Conservation Land Tax Reduction Program will be replaced by a system that reduces the tax rate on eligible lands through the regular property-tax process. These changes will also reduce the tax assessment on most of these lands.<P>

The tax rate for eligible managed forest land will be set at 25 per cent of the local residential tax rate while there will be no tax on eligible conservation lands.  Landowners will need to apply to have eligible land covered by the changes, and management plans will still be required for managed forests.  The minimum size of eligible land is four hectares (about 10 acres) for forests and 0.2 hectares (about half an acre) for conservation lands.  The elimination of the rebate programs also means the elimination of any rebate cap. <P> 

Rick Monzon, Executive Director of the Ontario Forestry Association, called the changes "Terrific.  I like the idea of reducing the acreage and I am happy that the rebate is being replaced by a more realistic assessment and mill rate."<P>

Lynn McIntyre, Secretary of the Ontario Woodlot and Sawmill Operators Association, said that the association agrees with the government move. 
"We view this as a positive step in sustaining private land forestry in Ontario."<P>

Protection of private woodlands benefits snowmobile clubs.  Landowners who have participated in the Managed Forest Tax Rebate Program are 
often more receptive to allowing recreational access to private woodlots.<P>

"The Province of Ontario has been a big partner in the development of snowmobiling in Ontario," said Tim West, Manager of External Relations for the Ontario Federation of Snowmobile Clubs.  "Any changes that have a positive impact on landowners are also a big plus for us."<P>

This tax change for managed forest and conservation lands will also apply to eligible lands owned by Conservation Authorities, which are ineligible under the existing rebate programs.<P>

"These changes will reduce red tape for private landowners and may affect tax revenues for some municipalities," Mr. Hodgson said.  "The government is working to address any impact the changes have."<P>

Mr Hodgson also indicated that there would be no effect on the existing provincial funding program for the operation and maintenance of flood control works.<P>

<B>Managed Forest Tax Rebate Program and <BR>
Conservation Land Tax Reduction Program

</B>
</CENTER><P>
Since its introduction in 1975 (retroactive to the 1973 tax year), the Managed Forest Tax Rebate Program has been instrumental in encouraging private woodlot owners to manage their properties for the long-term sustainability of the environment.  The program offered a 75-per-cent rebate on property taxes for the managed forest portion of a qualifying property.  The program was cancelled by the previous NDP government in 1993, which had other spending priorities.  The current government reinstated the program in February, 1996 in keeping with a commitment made in the report of the Mike Harris Task Force on Rural Economic Development released in 1994.<P>  

The Conservation Land Tax Reduction Program was introduced for the 1987 tax year and has been offered without interruption since then.  The program aims to ease the property-tax burden that threatens the preservation of land vital to Ontario's natural heritage.  It offers a 100-per-cent tax rebate for qualifying lands.<P>

Both programs were intended to be short-term solutions to address unfair property-tax systems that penalize people for protecting important natural areas.  The government is moving ahead with its commitment to tax reform that ensures there is a permanent commitment to the environment and is making changes as part of its response to the recommendations of the Who Does What  committee.  These long-term, permanent property-tax reforms eliminate the need for the Managed Forest Tax Rebate and Conservation Land Tax Reduction programs. <P> 

Starting in the 1998 tax year, eligible managed forests and conservation lands, including such lands owned by Conservation Authorities, will be assessed in a similar manner to farmlands, upon application by the landowner.   Farmland in Ontario is assessed on the basis of current value in current use.  The tax rate for eligible managed forests will be set at 25 per cent of the residential tax rate of the local municipality, while eligible conservation lands will be exempt from property taxes.  This means that property owners will benefit from lower taxes rather than having to wait for the government to process a rebate, as occurred in the past.<P>

These new measures bring greater fairness to the property-tax system and promote responsible environmental stewardship.<P>

<B>Ontario Parks - Paddling In A New Direction
</B>
</CENTER><P>
Natural Resources Minister Chris Hodgson said today that <I>Ontario Parks</I> made significant gains during its first six months of operation.<P>

I am impressed with how quickly <I>Ontario Parks</I> has delivered on commitments made less than a year ago,  Mr. Hodgson said.   In particular, it has made solid improvements in the areas of customer service, facilities and partnerships. <P>

Mr. Hodgson announced the new <I>Ontario Parks</I> structure for the provincial parks system on May 1, 1996.<P>

<I>Ontario Parks</I> has two basic objectives.  One is to maintain and protect Ontario s world renowned 265 parks and irreplaceable natural and cultural heritage.  The other objective is to manage parks more efficiently.  This includes providing opportunities for involvement by partners and by the private sector to allow the parks system to continue to prosper in a challenging fiscal environment.<P>

Key areas where <I>Ontario Parks</I> has made significant progress include:<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Creating More Parks</B> - Through many partnerships, new nature reserve parks are being considered, including Wainfleet Bog, Calder Island, Shaw Woods, Lyal Island, Carden Alvar, Holland River Fens and Alfred Bog, as well as selected Carolinian forest and Great Lake sites.<P>

<LI><B>Enhancing Existing Parks</B> - In Algonquin, after successful negotiations with CN Rail in 1996, a 128-km rail line right-of-way running through the park has been added to the park s landbase.  Under a proposal now in the final stages of public review, Wabakimi Provincial Park would be expanded from 155,000 hectares to almost 900,000 hectares, and MNR is committed to regulating the new boundary early in 1997.  And in 1996, Massasauga became the newest operating provincial park, with 135 interior camp sites, sheltered bay and coves.<P>

<LI><B>Facility Improvements</B> - <I>Ontario Parks</I> has made some good business investments to upgrade existing facilities, such as the addition of 1,162 new Hydro sites to the parks system.  This resulted in an additional $800,000 in revenue during the 1996 season.  At Balsam Lake, for instance, 64 sites were converted to electricity, for an increase of $22,000 in revenue.  And at Mississagi, a co-op project with Ontario Hydro resulted in the installation of $50,000 worth of solar equipment and storage battery packs to operate lights and power in the park.  Also, new campgrounds are being constructed in parks including Sandbanks and Bass Lake.<P>

<LI><B>Customer Service</B> - <I>Ontario Parks</I> is reaching out and delivering information and services in new and effective ways.  In particular, our <A HREF="http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/MNR/parks/index.html">Web site</A> on the Internet is a resounding success, with close to 20,000 hits in its first six months.  People now have access to more information directly from home, in addition to interactive functions and games related to parks and the many opportunities they offer.  An excellent opportunity for unlimited use of provincial parks is provided by our new season permits, at $30.00 for the 1996-97 winter permit and $40.00 for the summer permit.  Convenient and economical, they also make great gifts.  And to serve more visitors, many parks now offer facilities accessible to persons with disabilities, while some parks also offer rental accommodation such as permanent tent-like structures called  yurts , and renovated park lodges and cabins.<P>

<LI><B>Partnerships</B> - More than 100 responses have been received to a prospectus sent to businesses earlier this year to develop major corporate partnerships.  Meanwhile, under existing partnerships with the private sector and community groups, many provincial parks, including Pakwash, Killarney, Peters Woods and Lake Nipigon, are already showing signs of 
increased activity.<P>
</UL>
Based on what has been achieved to date, I am more confident than ever that <I>Ontario Parks</I> will ensure the parks system continues to be a provincial showcase, enhancing tourism and business objectives for Ontario,  Mr. Hodgson added.<P>

<I>Ontario Parks</I> is accountable to the Minister through a soon-to-be appointed board of directors, and oversees a special purpose account for retaining and managing parks revenues.<P>

<B>CFIP Funding Hits Record Level, Says Hodgson
</B>
</CENTER><P>
The Ministry of Natural Resources provided $515,000 in funding to support volunteers in 242 fishery improvement projects across Ontario in 1996, announced Natural Resources Minister Chris Hodgson.<P>

"This is the largest amount MNR has ever invested in its Community Fisheries Involvement Program in a single year," Hodgson said.<P> 

MNR's Community Fisheries Involvement Program (CFIP) provides seed money and technical expertise to organized volunteer groups that have had projects approved by the ministry. Typical activities include: fish culturing and stocking projects, spawning bed restorations, stream rehabilitations, fish transfers, fish ladders and fishery assessments.  CFIP funds are generally used for materials and supplies with the volunteer group providing all the necessary labor to complete the project.<P>

 "The CFIP program facilitates worthwhile fishery projects throughout the province, but it is only possible because of the great contributions in time and energy provided by dedicated CFIP volunteers," said Minister Chris Hodgson.  "I want to heartily thank all the participating individuals and groups for their vital assistance and pledge my ministry's continued support for this important program."<P>

Aside from providing direct benefits to Ontario fisheries, CFIP projects also enrich the volunteers who take part in them. Participants contribute to the resource while also learning about the finer points of fishery management.<P>

Funding for CFIP projects now comes from the special account established last year by MNR to support fish and wildlife management activities using revenue collected from fish and wildlife licence fees, royalties and fines.<P>

Groups receiving CFIP funding in 1996 included: tourist outfitters, fish and game clubs, schools, First Nations, service clubs, lake groups, cottagers' associations and community associations. The average CFIP contribution in 1996 was approximately $2,130 per project.<P>

Interested groups or individuals should contact their local MNR District Office for further information on the program or projects in their area.<P>

<BODY BGCOLOR = "FFFFFF">
<IMG SRC="Mandate.gif"><P>
<BODY>
<H3>MNR'S GOAL</H3>
To contribute to the environmental, social and economic well-being of Ontario through the sustainable development of natural resources.<P>
<H3>MNR'S OBJECTIVES</H3>
<UL>
<LI>To ensure the long-term health of ecosystems by protecting and conserving our valuable soil, aquatic resources, forest and wildlife resources as well as their biological foundations.
<LI>To ensure the continuing availability of natural resources for the long-term benefit of the people of Ontario; that is, to leave future generations a legacy of the natural wealth that we still enjoy today.
<LI>To protect natural heritage and biological features of provincial significance.
<LI>To protect human life, the resource base and physical property from the threats of forest fires, floods and erosion.
</UL>
This calls for an ecosystem-based approach to the management of Ontario's natural resources, with ecosystems defined to include the economic and social activities of humans as well as the natural environment.<P>
Since the essential attribute of healthly ecosystems is sustainability, MNR's goal can also be described as the maintenance of ecosystem health through the balancing of environmental, economic and social components.<P>
Fiscal constraints and rapid change are moving governments to concentrate on outcomes. The accountability of a ministry can be more clearly defined and systematically evaluated if these preferred results are clearly defined, priorities are more explicitly determined, and the contribution of various activities, functions and strategies are more rigorously assessed.<P>
<H3>BENEFITS</H3>
Accomplishing the above four objectives contributes to significant benefits in Ontario.<P>
<UL>
<LI>healthy natural ecosystems,
<LI>a healthy and safe natural environment for people,
<LI>resource based jobs,
<LI>community stability,
<LI>competitive, natural resource-based industries,
<LI>revenue to the Province,
<LI>outdoor recreation.
</UL><P>
MNR's contribution to each benefit varies across the province. Other government agencies and other sectors of society also contribute to these benefits.

<B>Hodgson Expands Sport Fishing Opportunities
</B>
</CENTER><P>
Natural Resources Minister Chris Hodgson today announced that the ministry is taking action to increase recreational fishing opportunities for lake trout across south-central Ontario.<P>

Based on recommendations from the new Fish & Wildlife Advisory Board, Mr. Hodgson said that effective January l, l997, 48 lakes will be open to lake trout fishing with:<P>
<UL>
<LI>no slot limits,
<LI>a daily catch limit of two fish,
<LI>two lines allowed for ice fishing, 
<LI>permission to use live bait.
</UL>
On six additional lakes stocked by MNR as 'put, grow and take' lakes, fishing seasons will be expanded to open January l. (See <A HREF="lake.html">lake lists</A> for details.)<P> 

"As a result of requests by the public, I asked the Fish and Wildlife Advisory Board to consider options which would benefit the lake trout fishery and increase recreational fishing opportunities," Mr. Hodgson said.  "The board worked closely with MNR staff to build on the lake trout strategy we had developed earlier."<P>

The Minister also announced that MNR will be initiating lake surveys in l997 and l998 on each of the 48 lakes to determine the best future management strategy. These surveys will be funded from Ontario fishing and hunting licence revenues. New ministry legislation has made it possible for these revenues to be used directly to benefit fish and wildlife programs.<P>

"In response to the Minister's request, we conducted an extensive review with the angling public, fishery biologists with the Ontario Federation of Anglers & Hunters, and MNR fish management staff," Fish and Wildlife Advisory Board Chairman Phil Morlock said. "Our recommendations are built on the foundation that conservation of the resource is the first priority, which is the message we also received from the angling public across central Ontario."<P>

The Minister has asked MNR staff to continue to work closely with the board and local committees to streamline lake trout regulations and to explore other management options that can continue to improve the quality of fishing in the region.<P>

<B>George Simmons Appointed To Review Tag Allocations
</B>
</CENTER><P>
Natural Resources Minister Chris Hodgson today announced the appointment of 
George Simmons to review the Ministry of Natural Resources' tag allocation systems for moose and deer.<P>

"I want to improve MNR's tag allocation systems and I have asked George Simmons to provide me with advice on how to do it," said Natural Resources Minister Chris Hodgson. "We are aware from our mail surveys that 56 per cent of responding hunters are dissatisfied with the current approach. With 110,000 moose hunters applying annually for approximately 20,000 tags in Ontario, we know we can't eliminate all complaints, but I hope we can reduce them substantially."<P>

Mr. Simmons has a background in municipal politics in central Ontario. His qualifications to conduct this review include his many years of experience hunting moose and deer in Ontario and his strong desire to see the quality of hunting in this province maintained and improved.<P>

Mr. Hodgson has instructed Mr. Simmons to meet with executives of provincial and local wildlife associations across the province between now and March 31, 1997 and to submit a written report by April 30, 1997. MNR hopes to implement recommendations for improvements in time for the 1997 hunting season.<P>

As of December 11, 1996,  Mr. Simmons had already met with officials of the Ontario Conservation Officers Executive, the Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters Big Game Committee and a hunt camp group.<P> 

Hunters who wish to contribute to the review process should make their views known to the officers of wildlife or hunting organizations to which they belong. Before making his final recommendations, Mr. Simmons will again contact all the groups making submissions to see if  they have any additional comments or recommendations.<P>

Interested members of the public can also submit their input and recommendations in writing directly to Mr. Simmons. Address submissions to: George Simmons, General Delivery, Irondale, Ontario, K0M 1X0. Submissions may also be sent by fax to:  (705) 755-2508.<P>

<B>MNR Studies Walleye Populations In Lac Seul
</B>
</CENTER><P>
Natural Resources Minister Chris Hodgson today announced that MNR and a group of partners will conduct a three-year study of the walleye population in Lac Seul, one of the major recreational lakes in northwestern Ontario.<P>

"This study will ensure the regulations we have in place are sufficient to protect the lake's walleye population over the long term," said Mr. Hodgson.  "A healthy walleye population is important for the continued economic health of this area which is widely celebrated for its great fishing."<P>

This is the first year of the three-year project designed to monitor new fisheries regulations such as the slot size and trophy limits that came into effect in the early 1990s. <P> 

Ministry of Natural Resources staff from both the Sioux Lookout and Red Lake offices will work in partnership with the Lac Seul Advisory Committee (LSAC), the local chapter of the Federation of Ontario Anglers and Hunters, the Sioux Lookout/Hudson Tourist Association, the 
Ear Falls/Perrault Falls Tourist Association and more than a dozen area tourist operators.  The goal of this partnership is to protect the lake's walleye population for generations to come. <P> 

"The slot size and trophy regulations were recommended to the ministry to prevent an over-harvest situation from developing," said Gary Beardsley, a member of the LSAC and a tourist operator on the lake.  "The project has increased local interest in monitoring Lac Seul's high quality fishery. We are pleased to contribute to projects like this which will benefit everyone over the long term."<P>

In an effort to conduct an extensive two-week netting study of Lac Seul's walleye population this past September, ministry partners provided manpower and equipment totalling about $21,000.  MNR provided about $17,000 including the staff expertise to design and supervise the project and analyse the results.  Similar preparations are being arranged for the next two years of this study.<P>

During the random netting study this September, a few lodge guests who were present became interested and even asked to help out.<P>

"One of the lodge guests from Minnesota told us that the netting program was an incredible learning experience," said Al Mathews, MNR's Sioux Lookout District Manager.  "He wrote a note to MNR to thank the lodge owners for their efforts to keep Lac Seul the best fishing lake he had ever seen."  
Mr. Mathews commended MNR's partners for their commitment to get more involved in gathering information that is used to make fisheries management decisions.<P> 

Lac Seul is about 150 kilometres long and 1,500 square kilometres in area, making it the second largest lake wholly in Ontario. Due to its size, Lac Seul comprises the entirety of Division 30 as described in the Sport Fishing Regulations Summary. A variety of fish species is found within the seven management zones of Lac Seul, including walleye, northern pike, smallmouth bass, and muskellunge.<P>  

Walleye is the favourite sport fish of the thousands of visitors who come to Lac Seul from all over the world to fish.  If data gathered from this project result in recommendations for changes to current regulations, the public will be advised and asked for comment through the Lac Seul Advisory Committee and the MNR.<P>

<B>Minister Announces Next Steps in Wabakimi Park Expansion
</B>
</CENTER><P>

Natural Resources Minister Chris Hodgson today announced a final public review  of the proposed boundary for the expansion to Wabakimi Provincial Park in Northwestern Ontario.<P>
 
"I'm committed to expanding Wabakimi Provincial Park as soon as possible," Mr. Hodgson said.  "To finish the process of park expansion, we want a final review of the proposed boundary for the park."<P>

MNR is seeking public input into the proposed new boundary for Wabakimi  Provincial Park.  The proposal is to add more than 700,000 hectares to the  existing Wabakimi Wilderness Park which is 155,000 hectares.  At close to  900,000 hectares, this provincial park would be the largest provincial park  within the forested region of Ontario, and the second biggest provincial park in the province, the largest being Polar Bear Provincial Park.<P>
 
 This area is well known for its ecological features and recreational  opportunities. The proposal to expand the park builds on the recommendations of  a boundary review committee that represented local interests.<P>

MNR's proposal to expand Wabakimi will create an extensive protected area with no mining, timber harvesting and hydroelectric development. The permitted uses recommended for the park recognize the importance of protecting the environment while encouraging recreation and related economic activity, particularly tourism.<P>

Ministry staff will work with Aboriginal communities adjacent to the proposed  new boundary on arrangements that will see their traditional uses of the area continues.<P> 

MNR has developed an information package on the boundary proposal that is available through Ontario's Environmental Registry.  Copies are also available through the MNR's Northwest Regional office.  The deadline for comments is January 31, 1997.<P>

Following the public review and park regulation, the park management planning process will begin. There will be more public involvement during the park management planning stage.<P>

The Ministry of Natural Resources is undertaking a final public review of the boundary for its proposal to expand Wabakimi Provincial Park from 155,000 hectares to close to 900,000 hectares (ha).  Natural Resources Minister Chris Hodgson announced a final review period on December 12, 1996.<P>

Wabakimi Provincial Park is located approximately 300 kilometres north of Thunder Bay, near the community of Armstrong in Northwestern Ontario. The Ministry of Natural Resources will analyse the comments from the public review before regulating the proposed park boundary early next year.<P><BR>

<B>1. Comments are requested on a specific proposal for an expanded boundary for Wabakimi Park.</B><P>
In 1992 the Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR) initiated a review of the original boundary of Wabakimi Provincial Park to look at the park's size, shape and representation of natural features. A proposal to expand Wabakimi was announced in April of 1995 with many details about the proposed expansion left to be worked out before the park could be regulated.<P>

These details included minor boundary adjustments and an accurate mapping of the boundary location. MNR staff have completed this work in the boundary proposal now available for public comment.  A Boundary Proposal Information Package is available that includes a map of the proposed expansion.<P><BR>


<B>2. General comments are requested regarding the permitted uses recommended for the expanded area.</B><P>
The Wabakimi Park Boundary Committee, representing local interests, recommended permitted uses for an expanded park based on ecosystem protection, recreation opportunities and maintenance of existing remote tourism activities. <P>

MNR's boundary proposal reflects the input of the committee.  Many of the current recreational and economic uses within the proposed expanded park area will continue to be permitted.  These include remote tourism, mechanized travel, hunting, trapping and bait fishing.  These are outlined in detail in the Boundary Proposal Information Package.<P>

More detailed consideration will be given to the extent and location of some permitted uses during park management planning.<P><BR>

<B>What other information is found within the final boundary proposal?</B><P>
The boundary proposal includes information on accommodating many of the current uses of the area through a unique framework of permitted uses recommended for the expanded park area.  The proposal also recommends that the expanded park area be classified as a Natural Environment Park.  The original 155,000-hectare Wabakimi Provincial Park will retain its wilderness classification.  Traditional Aboriginal uses will continue within all of the expanded park area.<P>

There is an area of 550 ha of leased mining claims near the northwestern edge of the proposed expansion.  Discussions are continuing with the primary leaseholder regarding the status and future of these claims.<P><BR>

<B>What happens after the review?</B><P>
The Minister of Natural Resources plans to proceed with park regulation after this review of the boundary proposal.  It is anticipated that regulation will occur in the spring of 1997.  Park regulation will be followed by a more detailed park management planning phase, during which additional public comments will be requested.<P>

MNR will amend the District Land-use Guidelines for Nipigon and Ignace to reflect the approved boundary and permitted uses resulting from this review.<P><BR>
<I><B>How to get the information package:</B></I><P>
Copies of the Boundary Proposal Information Package that provides additional details are available by calling (807) 475-1251.  The information is also on Ontario's electronic Environmental Registry (ER) and can be accessed using a home computer and modem (dial 1-800-667-9979). The ER is also available at most public libraries.<P><BR>

</CENTER><P><BR>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="w1.jpg"></CENTER><P><BR>
The Ministry of Natural Resources proposes an expansion to Wabakimi Provincial Park from 155,000 hectares to close to 900,000 hectares.  After expansion, Wabakimi Provincial Park will be the largest area of protected boreal forest in Ontario and the second largest provincial park (Polar Bear being the largest). The proposed boundary expansion will add substantially to the conservation values already included within the existing Wabakimi Provincial Park boundary, without compromising established recreational and tourism uses.<P><BR>

Some of the key values of the expanded park are summarized below:<P>

<B>Woodland Caribou:</B><P>
<UL>
<LI>the boundary proposal incorporates a large portion of high-value caribou habitat (a total of 550,000 hectares)
<LI>the area will include key winter habitats, calving lakes and travel corridors
<LI>the expansion area is sufficiently large to provide for seasonal habitat requirements of many of the area's caribou
<LI>an estimated 300 or more woodland caribou inhabit the expanded park area for at least part of the year
</UL><P><BR>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="w3.jpg"></CENTER><P>
<B>Landscape Features:</B><P>

<B>New MNR Guidelines For Some Activities On Crown Land
</B></CENTER><P>
The Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR) has in place new guidelines that outline how to conduct some activities on Crown land that no longer require a work permit.  The guidelines are designed to help protect public safety and the environment.<P>

The new guidelines cover activities for which MNR used to issue work permits under legislation such as the <I>Public Lands Act</I> and the <I>Lakes and Rivers Improvement Act</I>.  MNR's new guidelines provide information on how to conduct such activities as mineral exploration, the construction of floating or pole-supported docks and logging activities such as road building covered under the <I>Crown Forest Sustainability Act</I> (CFSA).<P>

MNR still requires permits for many activities on Crown land.  For example, MNR requires a permit for dredging activity that has the greatest potential for environmental harm including dredging new boat channels, swimming areas, and dredging to remove rocks and boulders. Other examples of permits MNR still requires include ones for:
<UL>
<LI>structures that occupy more than 15 square metres of shorelands (examples: concrete docks, boat ramps, docks and boathouses with a total crib surface area greater than                      15 square metres)
<LI>dredging and filling activities
<LI>construction of breakwalls
<LI>construction of all new roads
<LI>construction of trails, other than for mineral exploration purposes
<LI>construction of bridges and dams
<LI>installation of large culverts or culverts draining a large area
<LI>construction of most buildings on public land
removal of aquatic vegetation
</UL>
MNR encourages people to contact their nearest ministry district or area office to obtain a fact sheet that outlines the guideline for the activity they want to undertake.  The fact sheets are listed at the end of this document.  Ministry staff will work with the public to ensure that a clear understanding exists regarding responsibilities and MNR's enforcement mandate for ecological sustainability.<P>

MNR only eliminated permits that will not compromise ecological sustainability or public safety or permits that duplicated other forms of approval.<P>

Companies, agencies and individuals continue to be responsible for insuring that their actions won't harm public safety or ecological sustainability when working on Crown or private land. People conducting activities on Crown or private land are expected to comply with all other federal and provincial legislation such as the <I>Federal Fisheries Act</I>, the CFSA, <I>the Mining Act</I>, <I>the Endangered Species Act</I> and the <I>Planning Act</I>.<P>

MNR has already issued new burning guidelines that replace the need for fire permits for the burning of piles of wood, leaves and grass, or fires for cooking or warmth within the province's fire regions.  The fire guidelines simplify the rules for the use of fire.  They outline the types of fires people may use without a permit, the safe burning times during the day when those fires can be set, and the safe size of the fire allowed.  Fires must be kept under control and must comply with the Forest Fires Prevention Act.  MNR still requires permits for large fires such as burning debris from forestry operations.  MNR retains the right to ban all fires when forest fire conditions are extreme.<P>

The changes to reduce the need for some fire and work permits has cut red tape, reduced the number of permits the ministry previously required, and will save more than $1 million in unnecessary paperwork and staff time.  Before the changes in permitting, MNR processed about 59,000 individual permits a year.  The ministry expects to reduce that total number by about 80 per cent.  More than 37,000 of the reduction comes from eliminating unnecessary fire permits that MNR used to issue for small fires, and for incinerators.<P>

<B>WORKING AROUND WATER?<BR>
What you should know about <BR>Fish Habitat and Building Docks and Boathouses<P>
FACT SHEET</B></CENTER><P>
The waters in front of your property are important fish habitat.  To maintain the shoreline waters so that fish may continue to live in these areas, you need to build your waterfront structures with care.<P>

This fact sheet provides important information for property owners planning to build a dock or boathouse.  It outlines the types of docks and boathouses that require a work permit under the Public Lands Act.  For situations where permits are not required, this fact sheet outlines best management practices for dock or boathouse construction.  If these practices are followed, fish habitat will be protected in most cases.<P>
 
<B>PERMITS</B><P>

The beds of most waterbodies in Ontario are legally public land. In the past, any dock or boathouse built on this land needed a work permit from the Ministry of Natural Resources.  Recent legislative changes removed the requirements for work permits for most docks and boathouses.  Listed below are the types of docks and boathouses that do, and do not, require a permit.<P>

Keep in mind that if your property fronts onto the Rideau or Trent-Severn Waterway, these areas are under <B>Federal</B> jurisdiction.  Approval for in-water and shoreline works in these areas will be granted by the Department of Canadian Heritage, Parks Canada.<P> 
<OL>
<LI><B>Docks and boathouses which WILL NOT require a work permit:</B><P>
<UL>
<LI>Cantilever docks
<LI>Floating docks and floating boathouses
<LI>Docks and boathouses supported by posts, stilts, or poles
<LI>Boathouses built above the high water mark
<LI>Crib docks and crib boathouses where the total supporting crib structure (including historical crib structures) does not exceed 15 sq. metres in surface area.

<LI>Any combination of the above (e.g. a floating dock with a crib 
 < 15 sq. metres).
<LI>Boat lifts and marine railways
<LI>Removal of an old dock or boathouse
</UL><P>
<LI><B>Docks and boathouses which WILL require a work permit:</B><P>
<UL>
<LI>Crib docks and/or boathouses where the total surface of all historical cribs and the proposed new cribs exceeds 15 sq. metres in surface area.
<LI>Docks with solid foundations (e.g. concrete), jetty docks, or docks constructed with steel sheeting
<LI>Boathouses with solid foundations (e.g. concrete)
</UL>
</OL>
If you plan to build any of the structures described in section 2, you will need approval under the Public Lands Act through the work permit process.   You can obtain a work permit application form by contacting your local MNR office. <P> 

Projects that require a work permit, pose a significant risk to the environment.  MNR may visit the site to assess the habitat in the area.  This takes time, so submit your application early in the planning process.<P> 

Construction of any type of two story boathouse, or single story boathouse with living accommodations, on Crown land is not covered under the Ministry's free use policy.  As a result, although you do not need a work permit, you will require land use occupational authority under the Public Lands Act, at an appropriate fee.  If you are thinking about building any type of two story boathouse or a boathouse with living accommodation, contact your local MNR office early in the planning stage.<P> 
  
Keep in mind that you may need other approvals.  Approval from one government agency does not guarantee that you will be able to obtain approval from another agency.<P> 

<B>BE ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY</B><P> 

The federal Fisheries Act provides for the protection of fish habitat.  Under this Act, no one may carry out work that harmfully alters, disrupts or destroys fish habitat, unless there is clear authorization.  Also, no one is permitted to deposit a harmful substance in water frequented by fish.  Breaking these regulations can mean substantial fines of up to $1,000,000, risk of imprisonment, and you may be required to cover the costs of returning the site to its natural state.<P>   

If you suspect your property is adjacent to a spawning or nursery site for species such as lake trout, brook trout,  walleye, pike, muskellunge, talk to staff at your local MNR office, or have your project reviewed by an environmental consultant.  These fish species often have only one spawning/nursery site in the waterbody.  Any structure placed near these sites could affect fish habitat and result in fewer fish.<P> <BR>
<B>BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES</B><P>

The following best management practices will help to ensure that your dock or boathouse will not harmfully alter or destroy fish habitat.  Following these practices will help to ensure that the terms and conditions of the federal Fisheries Act are not violated. <P> 

In addition, it's a good idea to talk to local contractors, engineers, and building supply outlets, to ensure that all aspects of your project are completed properly.<P>
<UL> 
<LI><B>Select a structure which minimizes disturbance to the river or lake bottom:</B> Cantilever, floating and post-supported boathouses and docks do not disturb river or lake bottoms or restrict the movement of water near the shore.  These structures can actually improve fish habitat by providing fish with extra shelter from predators.   From a fish habitat perspective, these structures are preferred.  If your dock requires a concrete abutment, this should be located entirely on the upland property, above the high water mark.<P>
 
<LI><B>Limit the size of crib foundations:</B> Crib foundations for docks and boathouses are acceptable if there is bridging between them which enables water to circulate.  Small cribs are preferred.  Vertical planking is not recommended along the dock, because it can restrict water movement.  Remember, if the total surface area of your cribbing exceeds 15 square meters, including existing or old cribs, you will need a permit from MNR.<P>
 
<LI><B>Use clean rocks taken from dry land:</B> If you are planning to build a crib dock or boathouse, use rocks that are clean and free of soil.  The rocks must not be taken from the lake or river bottom, or the shoreline.  Removal of rocks from these areas could destroy fish habitat and result in charges under the federal Fisheries Act.<P>
 
<LI><B>Avoid any solid structures without bridging:</B> Generally, MNR will not approve solid docks made from cement or steel sheeting.  These structures are vulnerable to ice damage, destroy fish habitat, and can create stagnant backwater areas.<P>
 
<LI><B>Be careful with pressure-treated wood:</B> If you are planning to use pressure- treated lumber, all cutting, end sealing, staining, etc. should be done well back from the water.  The wood should be completely dry before being placed in the water.  These practices will help to reduce the amount of contaminants released into the waterbody.<P>
 
<LI><B>Avoid projects which involve in-water dredging and filling:</B> Dredging and filling may be harmful to fish and their habitat.  If your project involves dredging or filling, you will need a permit.<P>
 
<LI><B>Do not work in the water during the spawning and nursery period for those fish species in your waterbody:</B>  In-water construction activities during spawning and nursery periods could kill eggs and young fish.  If you are planning intensive, in-water construction activities, contact your local MNR district office for details on timing your project to protect fisheries. <P>
</UL>
For more detailed advice on how to perform in-water works in an environmentally friendly manner, contact your local MNR office.<P>

<B>WORKING AROUND WATER?<BR>
What you should know about <BR>the Lakes and Rivers Improvement Act
<P>
FACT SHEET</B></CENTER><P>
The Lakes and Rivers Improvement Act gives the Ministry of Natural Resources the mandate to manage water-related activities, particularly in the areas outside the jurisdiction of Conservation Authorities.  The purpose of the Act is to manage the use of the waters of the lakes and rivers of Ontario, to regulate improvements in them, and to provide for:<P>
<UL>
<LI>preserving public rights in or over water;

<LI>protecting the interests of riparian owners;

<LI> management of fish, wildlife and other natural resources dependent on such waters;

<LI>preserving natural amenities; and

<LI>ensuring the suitability of the location and nature of improvements.
</UL>

The waters in front of your property are important fish habitat.  To maintain the shoreline waters so that fish may continue to thrive in these areas, water-related structures should be built with care.<P>

This Fact Sheet provides important information for planning and building the types of "projects" that <B>require</B> a permit under the Lakes and Rivers Improvement Act.<P>

For situations where a permit is <B>not required</B>, this Fact Sheet outlines some best management practices.  It also identifies several reference documents to aid in carrying out work in an environmentally sound manner.  If these practices are followed, fish and wildlife habitat as well as riparian interests can be protected.<P>

The Lakes and Rivers Improvement Act applies to both private and public lands covered by water.  In the past, the LRIA required approvals for any dam built on this land; i.e. a work permit from the MNR.  Recent legislative changes removed the permit requirements for some types of projects, but not for others.  Table 1 indicates what does and does not require an approved work permit under the Act.<P><BR>

If you plan to build the structures identified in Table 1 as requiring a work permit, you will need approval under the Lakes and Rivers Improvement Act.  You can obtain a work permit application form by contacting your local MNR office.<P>

Projects that require a work permit, can pose a potentially significant risk to the environment.  MNR may visit the site to assess the habitat in the area, as well as other environmental concerns.  This takes time, so submit your application early in the planning process.<P>

Keep in mind that you may need additional approvals.  For example, property fronting on the Rideau Canal or the Trent-Severn Waterway, is under Federal jurisdiction; for in-water and shoreline works approval, contact the Department of Canadian Heritage, Parks Canada.  Bridges and large culverts may require Canadian Coast Guard approval under the Navigable Water Protection Act.<P>

It is also important to remember that approval from one government agency does not guarantee that you will be able to obtain approval from another agency.<P>

<B>BE ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY</B><P>

Construction activities in water disrupt water flows and cause changes to water quality and fish habitat.  The federal Fisheries Act provides for the protection of fish habitat.  Under this Act, no one may carry out work that harmfully alters, disrupts or destroys fish habitat, unless there is specific project authorization.  Also, no one is permitted to deposit a harmful substance in water frequented by fish.  A conviction under the Fisheries Act can result in fines of up to $1,000,000 and/or imprisonment, and you may be required to cover the costs of restoring the site.<P>

Construction activities in water can affect fish habitat in three ways:<P>
<UL>
<LI>placement of fill or building in-water structures can cover important spawning beds or feeding areas;

<LI>digging and filling in water introduces sediment that can be transported downstream a considerable distance. Sediment can kill fish, destroy spawning beds, and cover food sources (4); and

<LI>an improperly placed culvert can block fish migration routes if there is insufficient water depth, or if stream flows are too fast.
</UL>
If you suspect your property is adjacent to or upstream from a spawning or nursery site for species such as lake trout, brook trout, walleye, pike, or muskellunge, your activities could place important fish habitat at risk.  You should either talk to staff at the local MNR office, or have your project reviewed by an environmental consultant.  The destruction of a single spawning or nursery site can result in a reduced fish population in the waterbody.  Such destruction of habitat could lead to charges under the federal Fisheries Act.<P> 

At certain times of the year, fish are more vulnerable to harm from sediment than at other times.  The risk of killing newly laid fish eggs can be reduced considerably by timing construction outside the fish spawning, incubation, and fry emergence times.  This occurs at different times for different fish species.  The local MNR office can provide information on times to avoid working in the specific waterbody you are located on.<P> 

Being environmentally friendly requires understanding the consequences of your actions, the use of designs engineered to perform the function intended, reduction of short term construction impacts to the lowest level possible and elimination of any long term damage to the ecosystem.  A reference source that sets out good design and construction practices for the installation of bridges and culverts is the "Environmental Guidelines For Access Roads and Water Crossings3. " <P> <BR> 

<B>BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES</B><P>

The following examples of best management practices will help you ensure that your project will not harmfully alter or destroy fish or wildlife habitat.  Following these practices will reduce the chances of violating the Fisheries Act.  It is also a good idea to talk to a biologist and an engineer to ensure that the design and construction aspects of your project are completed properly.<P>
<UL>
<LI>Waterways must not be blocked so as to impede the free movement of water and fish.<P>
 
<LI>Culvert and bridge openings must be sized to pass flood flows expected during the life of the structure.<P>
 
<LI>Mitigation measures for erosion and sediment control must be used to reduce sediment entering the water to the lowest level practically achievable.<P>
 
<LI>Fill material placed below high water level within the floodplain of water bodies must be erosion resistant.<P>
 
<LI>The use of heavy construction machinery on stream or lake beds is discouraged during spawning and incubation periods and must be kept to an absolute minimum at other times.<P>
 
<LI>Fill slopes and waterway banks disturbed during construction must be trimmed to a stable angle of repose and protected from erosion.  Upon completion of the project, any temporary fill, surplus culverts, refuse, etc. must be removed from the construction area and disposed of in a satisfactory manner.<P>
 
<LI>Measures must be taken to prevent contamination of waterbodies by foreign materials such as lumber, nails, logs, brush, fuel, oil, lime, cement, asphalt, calcium chloride, sodium chloride, oil base wood preservatives, and herbicides.<P>  
 
<LI>Minimize the duration of construction, and stabilize exposed soils as soon as possible after final grades are established.<P>
 
<LI>Stabilize the site by encouraging the re-establishment of vegetation as quickly as possible:  Avoid late fall or winter construction for works requiring vegetative stabilization.<P>
 
<LI>Avoid winter construction where soil compaction is critical to the structural integrity of the works (e.g. dams and culverts).<P>
 
<LI>Avoid construction on streams during high flows or periods when a spring flooding may occur.<P>
 
<LI>Protect existing vegetation as much as possible - it is nature's erosion control cover.<P>
 
<LI>Select a structure which minimizes disturbance to the river or lake bottom:  For example, cantilever, floating and post-supported dock structures minimize disturbance to river or lake bottoms, and allow the movement of water near the shore.  These structures can actually improve fish habitat by providing fish with extra shelter from predators. From a fish habitat perspective, these structures are preferred.<P>
 
<LI>Limit the area of disturbance:  For example, a crib dock can be built with bridging between the cribs to enable water circulation.  Small cribs are preferred. Construction which restricts water movement is not recommended.  Remember, if the total surface area of your cribbing exceeds 15 square meters on the lake/river bottom, including existing or old cribs, you will need a permit from the MNR.<P>
 
<LI>Use clean granular materials or rock fill, taken from dry land:  Materials that are coarse, with few particles of sand size and finer, will minimize sediment transport and provide a stable structure resistant to erosion.  Material must not be taken from the lake or river bottom or the shoreline, unless it has been specifically authorized by MNR.<P> 
 
<LI>Plan construction operations and materials to minimize impact on water quality:  For example, if you are planning to use pressure treated lumber in a project, all cutting, end sealing, staining, etc. should be done well back from the water. <P> 
<LI>The treated surface should be completely dry before being placed in the water.  These practices will help to reduce the amount of contaminants released into the waterbody.<P>
 
<LI>Avoid in-water dredging:  Dredging may be harmful to fish and their habitat.  If your project involves dredging, you will need a permit.<P>
 
<LI>Avoid critical spawning and nursery periods:  In-water construction activity should not occur during the spawning and nursery period for those fish species in the waterbody at the project site.  It could kill eggs and young fish.<P>
 
<LI>For high risk projects, develop a Sediment Control Plan to guide the builders:  These plans set out the construction sequence, expected operations that could cause sediment to enter the waterbody, and measures that will be taken to control erosion and sediment.<P>
 
<LI>Learn about potential impacts of construction and techniques to minimize the impacts:  Information is available in the following MNR publications:<P>

What you should know about <BR>Fish Habitat and Controlling Aquatic Plants

<P>
FACT SHEET</B></CENTER><P>
Aquatic plants are a natural part of healthy aquatic ecosystems.  Plants play an important role in the ecology of shoreline areas, and they provide habitat in which fish can spawn, hatch their eggs, feed, and hide from predators.  Aquatic plants also help maintain water quality by stabilizing sediments.<P>

The Ministry of Natural Resources aims to maintain and improve the quality of fish habitat in Ontario so that fish will continue to have healthy places to live.  If you own or lease waterfront property, you can help protect the fish in your lake or river by protecting fish habitat along your waterfront.<P>

Having too many aquatic plants can interfere with boats, swimming and other water activities.  At times, some control may be necessary.  However, indiscriminate removal of aquatic plants can harm the environment and destroy fish habitat.<P>

This fact sheet provides important information for property owners planning to remove aquatic plants.  It outlines when a work permit under the Public Lands Act is required.  For situations where permits are not required, this fact sheet outlines best management practices for aquatic plant removal.  If these practices are followed, fish habitat will be protected in most cases.<P><BR>
<B>PERMITS</B><P>

Anyone proposing to apply a herbicide for the control of aquatic plants must first obtain a permit issued by the Ministry of Environment and Energy (MOEE) under the Pesticides Act.  If you are planning to use a herbicide, you will not need a work permit from MNR.<P>

Keep in mind that if your property fronts onto the Rideau Canal or Trent Severn Waterway, these areas are under Federal jurisdiction.  To obtain approval for in-water and shoreline works in theses areas, contact the Department of Canadian Heritage, Parks Canada.<P>

If you wish to remove aquatic plants by physical or mechanical methods (e.g. using rakes, mechanical harvesters or bottom barriers) you may need a work permit from MNR.  The beds of most waterbodies in Ontario are legally public land.  Historically, any project which involved aquatic plant removal on this land needed a work permit.  Recent legislative changes removed the requirements for work permits for some aquatic plant removal projects.  Listed below are the projects that do, and do not, require a permit under this legislation:<P>
<OL>
<LI><B>Aquatic plant removal projects which WILL NOT require a work permit:</B><P>

Removal of up to 100 sq. metres of aquatic vegetation annually from any lake or stream located south of the line formed by Highway 7 from Lake Huron (at Sarnia) to Sharbot Lake at Highway 38, and the area south of Highway 401 from Kingston to the Quebec border.<P>

<LI><B>Aquatic plant removal projects which WILL require a work permit:</B><P>

If you plan to remove any amount of aquatic vegetation from a lake or stream in the area north of Highway 7 from Lake Huron to Sharbot Lake; or the area north of Highway 401 from Kingston to the Quebec border, you will need approval through the work permit process. <P>
 
	Removal of more than 100 square metres of aquatic vegetation annually from any lake or stream located south of Highway 7 from Lake Huron to Sharbot Lake, and south of Highway 401 from Kingston to the Quebec border.
</OL>

If your project involves in-water dredging (removal of rocks or sediment from the bottom) or filling, you require a permit from MNR.<P>

Projects that require a work permit can pose a significant risk to fish habitat.  MNR may visit the site to assess the habitat in the area.  This takes time, so submit your application early.   You can obtain a work permit application form by contacting your local MNR office.<P>   

Keep in mind that you may also need other additional approvals (i.e. Parks Canada). Approval from one government agency does not guarantee that you will be able to obtain approval from another agency.<P> <BR> 

<B>BE ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY</B><P>

The federal Fisheries Act provides for the protection of fish habitat.  Under this Act, no one may carry out work that harmfully alters, disrupts or destroys fish habitat, unless there is clear authorization.  Also, no one is permitted to deposit a harmful substance in water containing fish.  Violations can mean substantial fines of up to $1,000,000, risk of imprisonment, and a requirement to cover the costs of returning the site to its natural state. <P><BR> 

<B>BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES</B><P>

The following best management practices will help to ensure that your aquatic plant removal project will not harm fish habitat.  Following these practices will also help to ensure that the federal Fisheries Act is not violated.<P>

To protect the aquatic environment, all plant control projects must be carefully planned and evaluated.  Important factors include:<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Control methods:</B>  Many control methods are available for aquatic plants.  These include raking, removing by hand, mechanical harvesting, using cutter-bar devices, bottom barriers such as mats or blankets, and the use of chemicals (herbicides).  Generally, the preferred methods from a fish habitat perspective are hand removal and raking.  The use of  cutter bar devices or mechanical harvesting is also acceptable provided disturbance of the lake bottom is minimized.<P>  

<LI><B>To use a herbicide:</B>  MOEE must approve your project, and you will need to obtain a Permit to Purchase and/or Perform a Water Extermination.  Contact your local office of MOEE.<P>

<LI><B>How much to remove:</B> The amount of plant material you may remove depends on the conditions in your waterfront site.  Factors include the fish species present, the abundance and distribution of plants, and the reasons why you are controlling the plants.<P>

Generally, in lakes with extensive plant growth, you may remove up to 100 square metres of aquatic plants.  However, in lakes with limited plant growth, removal of even small amounts of plant growth may be unacceptable.<P>  

<LI><B>Dispose of the plants on dry land:</B> If the plants are removed by physical or mechanical methods, they should be temporarily placed in a holding site distant from the shoreline before disposal.  This prevents leaching of nutrients back into the water.<P>
	
<LI><B>Timing is critical:</B> Warm-water fish species spawn during spring and early summer.  Removing aquatic plants at this time could kill eggs and young fish.  If you do not require a permit, we recommend that you only remove vegetation after the second or third week in June.<P>  

If you are in an area where a permit is required,  the permit will specify the exact time of removal.<P>  

<LI><B>Avoid projects which involve in-water dredging and filling:</B> Dredging and filling may be harmful to fish and their habitat.  If your project involves filling or dredging (removal of rocks or sediment from the bottom), you will need a permit.<P>  <BR>

What you should know about Fish Habitat and Dredging

<P>
FACT SHEET</B></CENTER><P>
Shoreline waters are home to hundreds of aquatic species including fish.  The nearshore area is where fish lay their eggs, feed, and seek protection from predators.  Changes to these areas can threaten their survival. <P>

The Ministry of Natural Resources' goal is to maintain and improve the quality of fish habitat so that fish will continue to have healthy places to live.  If you own or lease waterfront property, you can help protect the fish in your lake or river by protecting fish habitat along your waterfront.<P>
	
Dredging is the removal or displacement of any material from the bottom of a lake or stream.  It can destroy the areas that fish need to live, breed and feed.  If you want to dredge a large area, there is a good chance you will harm fish habitat.  In addition your dredging project can stir up the material on the bottom of your lake or river, and this may affect water quality for you and your neighbours.<P> 

If you decide to dredge, you will need to take special care to preserve fish habitat.  This fact sheet provides important information for property owners planning to dredge.  It outlines when a work permit under the Public Lands Act is required.  For situations where permits are not required, this fact sheet outlines best management practices for dredging.  If these practices are followed, fish habitat will be protected in most cases.<P><BR>

<B>PERMITS</B><P>

The beds of most waterbodies in Ontario are legally public land.  Historically, any project which involved dredging on this land or on shorelands (defined as the area below the high water mark) required a work permit from the Ministry of Natural Resources.  Recent legislative changes remove the requirement for a work permit for some dredging projects.  Listed below are the projects that do, and do not require a permit under this legislation.<P>

Keep in mind that if your property fronts onto the Rideau Canal or Trent-Severn Waterway, these areas are under <B>Federal</B> jurisdiction.  Approval for in-water and shoreline works in these areas will be granted by the Department of Canadian Heritage, Parks Canada.<P>

</UL>
</OL><P>
Projects that require a work permit can pose a significant risk to fish habitat.  To assess the impact of your project on the environment, MNR may visit the site.  This takes time, so submit your application early.   You can obtain a work permit application form by contacting your local MNR office. <P>  

You may also need other additional approvals (e.g. Conservation Authorities).    Approval from one government agency does not guarantee that you will be able to obtain approval from another agency. <P><BR> 

<B>BE ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY</B><P>

The federal Fisheries Act provides for the protection of fish habitat.  Under this Act, no one may carry out work that harmfully alters, disrupts or destroys fish habitat, unless there is clear authorization.  Also, no one is permitted to deposit a harmful substance in water containing fish.  Violations can mean substantial fines of up to $1,000,000, risk of imprisonment, and a requirement to cover the costs of returning the site to its original state.<P>

Dredging can effect water quality and destroy those areas that fish and wildlife live. Before deciding to dredge, consider the cost of the project and the cost of maintenance.  Also consider if there are alternatives.  For example, could you drive your boat around that shoal, stump or rock, or use an offshore mooring or swimming raft?<P><BR>

<B>BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES</B><P>

The following best management practices will help to ensure that your dredging project will minimize harm to fish habitat and ensure that the federal Fisheries Act is not violated. <P> 
<UL>
<LI><B>Dredging methods:</B>  Many methods are available for dredging.  These include removing material by hand or shovel, and mechanical methods such as a backhoe or other heavy equipment.  The preferred methods from a fish habitat perspective are hand removal and shoveling.<P>  

<LI><B>How much to remove:</B> The size of the area you may dredge depends on your project type and the conditions in your waterfront site.  Factors include the fish species present, the habitat at the site, the type of substrate, and the reasons why you are dredging.<P>

	For those dredging projects that do not require a permit (e.g. dredging to install a private water line, or heat loop) minimize the size and depth of the area to be dredged.<P> 
	
	Generally, those types of activities that require a permit (dredging for a boat channel or swimming/beach area) pose a high risk to fish habitat.  The size of the area to be dredged should be kept to a minimum.  For example, dredging for a single boat channel should be no wider than six metres.<P>  

	A boat channel can be shared among adjacent property owners.  For safety reasons, shared or community boat channels need to be wider than single channels.  In most cases, community channels should not exceed eight metres in width.<P>  

	If you need a work permit, the permit will specify the area that can be dredged.<P>    

<LI><B>Disposal of the dredge material:</B>  If the dredged material is made up of material that will not be transported by wave action, (e.g. gravel, rocks, boulders), it is a good idea to redistribute this material in the area immediately adjacent to the site on the lake/stream bottom.  These materials provide excellent places for fish to lay their eggs, hide, and feed.  Therefore by placing this material back into the lake (near the original site) you are moving that excellent fish habitat to another spot.  Just be sure that you are not creating a navigational hazard.<P>  

If however the materials are fine (silt, sand, clay),  then all dredged material must be disposed of on land, and it must be suitably contained to prevent it from washing back into the water.   Fine dredged material such as silt and sand can cover the areas that fish need to feed and reproduce.  In addition these fine materials can affect water quality so you must ensure that the dredged material does not enter your neighbour's property. It is a good idea to cover the trench or dredged area with gravel or cobble material.  Gravel/ cobble is stable and will not be transported by wave action.  It is also very good fish habitat.<P>  

If you require a work permit you should outline, in your work permit application form, specifically where the dredged material will be placed.<P>  

You cannot dispose of dredged material in open waters unless you have special authorization from the Ministry of the Environment and Energy.  In some cases you may also require approval from the Canadian Coast Guard.  If you get approval, a series of rigorous chemical tests must be done to ensure the dredged material will not harm the water quality.  You will be required to pay for these tests.<P>  

<LI><B>Timing is critical:</B> In-water dredging activity should not occur during the fish spawning and nursery period since it could kill eggs and young fish.  If you are planning, in-water construction activities, contact your local district office for details on timing your project to minimize impacts on the aquatic environment. <P>  

If your project requires a permit, the permit will specify the exact time of dredging.<P>  

<LI><B>Maintain or preserve bankside or shoreline vegetation.</B>  Shrubs and trees growing adjacent to lakes and streams are important.  This vegetation provides overhead cover for fish, shade to minimize warming of the water, and a source of food for fish as insects fall off the vegetation into the water.  Near-shore vegetation also provides benefits to wildlife in the form of nesting sites, cover from predators, etc.  In addition, the vegetation can help stabilize the soils in the area thereby minimizing erosion.<P>  

The removal of some vegetation adjacent to the waterbody may be necessary to allow access of equipment.  All areas should be stabilized to prevent erosion and replanted as soon as possible.<P> 

<LI><B>Avoid areas with aquatic plants.</B>  Aquatic plants play an important role in the ecology of shoreline areas.  Where possible, avoid dredging in these areas.  If you must dredge in these areas contact your local office of the Ministry of Natural Resources.  You may need authorization through the work permit process to remove aquatic vegetation.<P> 

<LI><B>Avoid spawning and nursery areas.</B> If you suspect your property is adjacent to a spawning or nursery site for species such as lake trout, brook trout, walleye, pike or muskellunge, we advise you to either talk to staff at your local MNR office, or have your project approved by an environmental consultant before you dredge.  These fish species often have only one spawning/nursery site in the waterbody.  Any in-water construction activity near these sites could affect fish habitat and result in fewer fish.<P>  
 
<LI><B>Protect water quality:</B> A sediment or silt screen should be installed around the work area prior to starting.  After the work is completed, the screen should be carefully removed after all of the sediment has settled on the lake bottom.<P>  

Work in the water on calm days.  This will help prevent the suspension of fine sediment particles into the water column by wave action and will ensure the silt screen is not disturbed by wave action.<P><BR>

<B>WORKING ON CROWN LAND<BR>  
What you should know about Mineral Exploration,<BR>  Building Construction and Road and Trail Construction.
<P>
FACT SHEET</B></CENTER><P>
Approximately 87% of the land in Ontario is owned and managed by the provincial Crown.  This land base includes the beds of, or land under, most navigable waterways.  The Ministry of Natural Resources is charged with managing that land base for the people of Ontario in an ecologically sustainable manner. <P>

This fact sheet provides important information for individuals and companies intending to carry out mineral exploration, building construction or road/trail construction on Crown land in Ontario. <P><BR>

<B>MINERAL EXPLORATION </B><P>

<B>PERMITS</B> <P>

Since 1989 mineral explorers carrying out certain mineral exploration activities on unpatented mining claims have been required to apply for work permit approval under the Public Lands Act (PLA).  Recent legislative changes to the PLA now limit work permit approval to the construction of roads and buildings.  <P>

However, those engaged in exploration are still responsible for conforming with other legislation while carrying out their activities. <P>
<OL>
<LI>Activities that will not require a work permit under the Public Lands Act:
<UL>
<LI>prospecting activities including clearing, mechanical stripping, bulk sampling, drilling and blasting; and

<LI>prospecting activities requiring the movement of heavy equipment,  drilling rigs,  etc.,<P>
</UL>

<LI>Activities which WILL require a work permit under the Public Lands Act:
<UL>
<LI>building construction.  Buildings are defined as structures consisting of a roof, wall or floor, but do not include floating structures, docks, boathouses, tents or ice huts.
</UL>
</OL>
<B>Plan ahead.</B>  If there is no existing road accessing the proposed area, apply well in advance to allow time for your application to be reviewed.<P>

<B>OTHER APPROVALS</B><P>

The removal of the requirement to get Public Lands Act work permits does not relieve mineral explorers from getting the applicable approval of other agencies (including Ministry of Northern Development and Mines, Ministry of Environment and Energy, Ministry of Labour).  Additionally they are expected to continue to comply with all other Federal and Provincial legislation such as the following: <P>
<UL>
<LI>Federal Fisheries Act - activities such as drilling on or near watercourses, trenching or stripping near watercourses that could lead to the harmful alteration of fish habitat;

<LI>Crown Forest Sustainability Act - the cutting of Crown owned trees during road construction or advanced exploration (as defined in the Mining Act);

<LI>Endangered Species Act - actions that will impact on endangered species of flora and fauna;

<LI>Planning Act.
</UL>
The following groups or individuals should be considered, and consulted where appropriate, by the mineral explorer before the work begins:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Surface rights owners  - where the surface rights are owned separate from the mining rights;

<LI>First Nations communities.
</UL>
<B>BE ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY</B><P>

Many mineral exploration activities, if not carried out in an environmentally conscious manner,  have the potential to cause a negative impact on the environment.  Fortunately, most individuals and companies involved in mineral exploration are aware of that potential and  operate in a manner so as to avoid any  problems or impacts.  Exploration activities that commonly impact on the environment and suggestions to lessen these impacts are listed below:<P>

<I>Drilling</I> - normally there is very little impact from drilling , however, when conducted on ice or in or near water, the potential for allowing a deleterious material to enter the water is increased.  This could lead to a violation of both the Fisheries Act and the Environmental Protection Act.  Ensure that you can contain all of the fluids and cuttings to allow for appropriate disposal away from the water.<P>

Another area where drilling can have an impact is when located near an endangered species during a critical  period of that organism's life cycle.  This may be more a case of appropriate timing rather then a prohibition on drilling.  For instance,  delaying drilling near a raptor nesting site is critical when the birds are breeding, incubating,  and rearing their young.<P>

Activities in or near water can impact on fish and fish habitat.  You are reminded that the Fisheries Act provides for the protection of fish habitat by stating that no one may harmfully alter, disrupt or destroy fish habitat   Also, no one is permitted to allow a deleterious substance to enter a waterbody frequented by fish. (A deleterious substance is any substance that when added to water alters the water in such a way as to be harmful to fish or fish habitat.  Common deleterious substances are sand and silt that have been stirred up from the bottom during construction work or allowed to erode into the watercourse).<P>

<I>Trenching</I> - trenching can lead to hazards for both humans and animals when the trench is left in poor condition.  Trenches are often left open to allow verification of work reported as well as ensuring the scientific benefit of viewing the exposed mineralization.  However,  care should be taken to protect the safety of other users and to protect the person who created the trench from liability.<P>

For instance, trenches that do not expose mineral soil should be filled in before leaving the area.  Trenches that need to be left open should be sloped to at least a 2:1 grade and the excavated material should also be sloped to at least a 2:1 grade to avoid  potential injuries to passersby.  In addition you will want to consider excavating an escape route from the trench.<P>

Trenches leading to water should be stabilized to avoid any erosion of loose material into the watercourse.  The eroded material would likely constitute a deleterious material resulting in a violation of the Fisheries Act and possibly the Environmental Protection Act. <P>

<I>Landowner Concerns</I> - because some exploration work involves heavy machinery the potential for  noticeable changes to the land surface rights holder are very real.  People involved in exploration activities on mining land where the surface rights are owned by someone other than the Crown should be aware of this sensitivity and seek to reduce the anxiety through consultation or possibly by avoiding working on/in certain sensitive sites.  Often these precautions result in time saved for the explorer because potentially contentious issues are avoided. <P>

Included in this area of discussion are the locations in the province which are known to be of concern to the local First Nation communities.  Examples would be activities conducted  in close proximity to Reserves or areas subject to a land claim and sites that are considered to have ceremonial or religious value.<P>

<I>Blasting</I>  - activities like blasting can be harmful when carried out near endangered wildlife species during  critical periods of their life cycle.  This could lead to inadvertent violations of the Endangered Species Act.  Blasting that takes place within a waterbody must be in accordance with the April, 1990 Department of Fisheries and Oceans' "GUIDELINES FOR THE USE OF EXPLOSIVES IN CANADIAN FISHERIES WATERS'. <P>

Blasting in water can create a number of unwanted environmental concerns such as harmful alteration or destruction of fish habitat contrary to the Fisheries Act.<P>

<I>Stripping</I> - care must be taken when stripping overburden from a site to ensure that an endangered species of flora or fauna , or its habitat,  is not destroyed or interfered with.  Stripping near watercourses can also create the potential for erosion and care should be taken to stabilize the removed material.<P><BR>


<B>BUILDING CONSTRUCTION</B><P>

<B>PERMITS</B><P>

The construction of most buildings and structures on Crown land normally requires the approval of MNR under the Public Lands Act in the form of a land use occupational authority.  Since 1989, any construction must be carried out in accordance with a work permit.<P>

Recent legislative changes have amended the Public Lands Act so that some buildings and structures no longer require work permit approval under the Public Lands Act.  The definition of a building that is contained within the new Regulation is "a structure consisting of a roof, wall or floor but does not include floating structures, docks, boathouses, tents or ice huts." <P> 
<OL>
<LI>Buildings or Structures which will not require a work permit under the Public Lands Act:<P>
<UL>
<LI>floating structures, ice fishing huts, tents; 

<LI>docks and boathouses , provided the structure is not supported by a solid foundation; 

<LI>crib docks and crib boathouses where the total surface area of all cribs is less than 15 square meters;

<LI>maintenance and improvements to existing recreation and outpost camps.  Maintenance of existing hunt camps (referred to as recreation camps) and outpost camps is subject to the conditions contained in the land use permit that authorizes the existence of those buildings on Crown land.<P>
</UL>

NOTE: all buildings and structures constructed in the water MUST be in front of, and often attached to, the constructors' private property.<P>

<LI>Buildings and structures which WILL require a work permit under the Public Lands Act:
<UL>
<LI>construction of all new buildings consistent with the definition of a building mentioned above (e.g., recreation camps, outpost camps, trap cabins, commercial fish camps, recreational trail shelters and buildings constructed by the resource harvest industry).  
</UL>
</OL>
Anyone intending to construct or place a building, as described above,  on Crown land will need the prior approval of a Public Lands Act work permit.  You may obtain work permit applications from your local MNR office, but remember to plan ahead and apply well in advance of your proposed construction date.<P>  

<B>OTHER APPROVALS</B><P>  

The construction of most  buildings and structures on Crown land normally requires separate land use occupational authority.  This authority is processed by the local MNR staff and often requires the payment of rent.<P>  

It is the responsibility of the constructor of any building or structure including docks, boathouses, etc. to comply with all existing laws and requirements.  For instance,  most buildings and structures placed in areas in municipalities require building permit approval before construction.  All buildings must be built in accordance with the Ontario Building Code.<P><BR> 

<B>ROADS AND TRAILS</B><P>  

<B>PERMITS</B><P>  

Since 1989, the clearing of any Crown land required the prior approval of a Public Lands Act work permit.  Often that clearing was the first step in the construction of a road or trail.  Recent legislative amendments have removed this requirement.<P>  

However,  the amended legislation requires work permit approval for the construction of roads and trails.  Trails are defined as "a path over public land not used for mineral exploration or extraction". <P>  
<OL>
<LI>Roads or Trails that will not require a work permit under the Public Lands Act:  
<UL>
<LI>all roads or trails that already exist and do not require construction;

<LI>all roads and trails that are constructed as part of a forest operation activity that is subject to the Crown Forest Sustainability Act (CFSA);

<LI>all trails constructed for mineral exploration or extraction;

<LI>general maintenance of existing roads and trails  such as grading, brushing, trail grooming, etc.<P>
</UL>
<LI>Roads or Trails that WILL require a work permit under the Public Lands Act:
<UL>
<LI>all new roads constructed on Crown land (except those subject to CFSA);

<LI>all new trails except those constructed for mineral exploration or extraction purposes;

<LI>existing roads or trails that are altered, widened, etc.,  other than what could be considered normal maintenance.
</UL></OL><P>
Work permit applications can be obtained from your local MNR office.  Remember to plan ahead and submit your application well in advance of your proposed construction date to allow for the necessary MNR review.<P>

<B>OTHER APPROVALS</B><P>

Some roads or trails that are constructed may require separate land use occupational approval under the Public Lands Act.  You will be advised by the local MNR staff should this requirement apply to any road or trail that you have received approval to construct.<P>

The Ministry of Transportation requires approval (entrance permits) for any road or trail that provides access from, across or to a highway right of way.<P>

<B>BE ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY</B><P>

The construction of roads and trails on Crown land can often impact directly on the environment.  However often there are impacts which are not so obvious .  For instance,  the clearing may cause violations of the Endangered Species Act,  access corridors may be created that allow increased pressure on a remote fishery,  remote tourism values may be affected through the creation of vehicle access to an area,  or neighboring landowners may resent having access created  to a previously boat access only area.<P>

It is important to consider all of these issues when any trail or road is planned.  Often you will be required to resolve any issues before a work permit will be issued.<P>

All roads and trails constructed on Crown land must be done so in accordance with the publication "ENVIRONMENTAL GUIDELINES FOR ACCESS ROADS AND WATER CROSSINGS, 1988". <P>

<B>Red And White Pine In Ontario<P>
FACT SHEET</B></CENTER><P>
Ontario has almost 4 million hectares of red and white pine, with a concentration ranging from 10 per cent to more than 40 per cent on any given stand.  This includes red and white pine in protected areas, conservation reserves and areas available for logging.<P>

Forest areas where red and white pine are the dominant species (40 per cent or more of all species present on any given stand), cover 723,658 ha.<P>

In forest areas where red and white pine dominate, more than 124,000 ha are classified as old red and white pine.  In these areas, MNR policy on the conservation of old growth pine will ensure that red and white pine forest ecosystems, including old growth stands, are present on the landscape now and in the future.<P>

To qualify as red and white pine old growth, a forest must meet certain criteria including the presence of old trees, associated trees and other plants, and little or no traces of activities such as logging.<P>

MNR has protected 66,000 ha of old growth red and white pine - 46,000 ha in provincial parks and conservation reserves, and 20,000 ha in no-cut reserves in forest management areas.  The following table shows the total area of red 
and white pine forests older than 120 years that are protected in Ontario:<P>

</TABLE><P>
This protection of red and white pine across its range includes 16,345 ha of old growth red and white pine forest in Quetico Wilderness Park in Northwestern Ontario, and in the Southcentral Region, 955 ha as part of 11,250 ha of protected red and white pine 81 years and older in Algonquin Park.<P>

 Of the total 66,000 ha area, nearly 11,000 ha is old growth red and white pine that is protected in the Temagami area.  A citizens committee, the Comprehensive Planning Council (CPC), recommended that the government protect 12 old growth red and white pine sites in Temagami.  The government accepted the CPC's recommendations on old growth.<P>
<B>Protection and Regeneration</B><P>
MNR has adopted a <I>Conservation Strategy For Old Growth Red and White Pine Ecosystems in Ontario</I>.  It commits MNR to protecting representative areas of old growth red and white pine forests to allow those areas to evolve through natural ecological processes.<P>
A key feature of MNR's conservation strategy is to leave healthy old trees (120 years and older), snags (standing dead trees), dying and rotting trees on red and white pine sites after logging.  MNR's goal is to ensure that a range of ages from young to old red and white pine trees are left in areas across the forested landscape.<P>
Where possible, protected areas will be surrounded by young red and white pine forest, so that the full range of ages is maintained to replace old growth in protected areas that change as a result of successional pressures such as wildfire and individual tree mortality.<P>
To ensure genetic conservation, natural regeneration, and wildlife habitat protection in red and white pine forests, MNR will leave healthy, mature seed trees in the harvested area, including some of the straightest and oldest, as well as dead and dying trees.  In addition, tree tops and limbs of harvested trees are left on the forest floor to provide wildlife habitat.<P>
In addition to protection and regeneration, the conservation strategy identifies other goals:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Ensuring that in a stand where it is the dominant species, red and white pine will be maintained.<P>
<LI>Ensuring that red and white pine areas are not reduced to less than current levels.<P>
<LI>Restoring red and white pine areas, guided by historical records, within the bounds of silvicultural funding at the management unit level.<P>
<LI>Ensuring an age distribution that maintains old red and white pine stands in areas across the forested landscape.<P>
<LI>Providing a sustainable supply of red and white pine to the forest industry.
</UL><P><BR>

<B>The Owain Lake Block<P>
FACT SHEET</B></CENTER><P>

The Owain Lake Block is located about 10 km west of the southern end of Lake Temiskaming, approximately 45 km south-east of the town of Temagami.  This 
321-ha harvest area is part of a larger, mature forest containing stands of red, white and jack pine. The Owain Lake Block is being partially logged.<P>

Significant portions of the Owain Lake Block were harvested before.  It is likely that the area was harvested before the turn of the century.  In addition, aerial photographs taken in 1946 show conclusively that approximately half of the block was harvested sometime between the late 1930s and the early 1940s.<P>

The Comprehensive Planning Council (CPC), a citizens committee, considered 
Owain Lake when it reviewed sites to be protected as old growth.  The government accepted the CPC's recommendations that the Owain Lake Block did not qualify as a representative old growth site that should be protected from harvest.<P>

Following extensive public consultation, the CPC recommended a land-use strategy for Temagami that included recommendations on protecting old growth red and white pine areas.  The government accepted the CPC's recommendations on protecting old growth.<P>

<B>Conservation Strategy</B><P>

In planning for harvesting in the Owain Lake Block, MNR has applied its <I>Conservation Strategy For Old Growth Red And White Pine Forest Ecosystems</I>.  This means that many old trees in the Owain Lake Block will not be logged in 1996 and after any future shelterwood harvests; snags, dying and rotting trees will be left standing; and tree tops and limbs will be left on the forest floor.  In addition, the plan leaves 93 ha in no-cut reserves where no logging will take place.<P>
 
The plan permits partial logging in 228 ha of the block.  Species to be harvested include jack pine, spruce, poplar and white birch, as well as red and white pine.  The "shelterwood system" used in the Owain Lake Block is a widely recognized harvesting method that encourages natural regeneration by leaving healthy mature trees standing, as well as snags, tree tops and limbs on the forest floor.<P>

<B>Temagami Old Growth Red And White Pine</B><P>

MNR has protected nearly 11,000 ha old growth red and white pine in the Temagami area.  This includes all 12 old growth red and white pine sites that the CPC recommended for protection.<P>

<B>Old Growth in Ontario</B><P>

Protected areas in Ontario where old growth red and white pine is the dominant species (40 per cent or more), cover 66,000 ha - 46,000 ha in provincial parks and conservation reserves, and 20,000 ha in no-cut reserves in forest management units.  As the dominant species on any given stand, old red and white pine cover more than 124,000 ha in Ontario.<P>

Forests containing a component of red and white pine cover almost 4 million ha in Ontario, in an area that covers much of Southern Ontario, north to Lake Temiskaming and west to an area just south of Wawa.  The red and white pine range also covers an area around Thunder Bay, Dryden, Fort Frances and Kenora.  Both species are common in the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence forest region.<P>

<B>Outdoors Cards Due for Renewal in 1996


</B>

</CENTER><P>
The Ministry of Natural Resources reminds anglers and hunters to check the expiry date of their Outdoors Card.  Cards issued in 1994 expire at the end of 1996 and need to be renewed.<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="oc.gif"></CENTER><P>

Application forms will be mailed automatically to the address on file for those whose current card is coming up for renewal.  Cardholders who were expecting a renewal form and have not received it by late November should call toll-free 1-800-387-7011.<P>

Forms should be completed and returned to MNR immediately to ensure that they are processed in time before the beginning of the next fishing or hunting season.  This is especially important for hunters who plan to enter one of the 1997 wildlife draws.<P>

The fastest and easiest way to renew an Outdoors Card is by telephone using a Visa or Mastercard.  Instructions for renewing by telephone are contained in the mailed renewal package.<P>

Anglers and hunters must have a valid Outdoors Card to purchase a fishing or hunting licence.<P>

<B>50th Anniversary <BR>
of the Conservation Authorities Act


</B>

</CENTER><P>
This year marks the 50th anniversary of the passage of the Conservation Authorities Act, a landmark piece of legislation that addressed the poor land-use practices and lack of flood control measures in the 1940s which led to frequent and damaging floods, extensive soil erosion, and insecure water supplies.<P>

Today, through the work of conservation authorities across much of the province, Ontario has incorporated watershed-based resource management planning,  and flood control measures into municipal and provincial strategic plans.<P>

"In recognizing this milestone in Ontario's history of  resource management," said Chris Hodgson, Minister of Natural Resources, "we salute the long-standing tradition of water management, natural heritage protection and outdoor recreation Ontario's conservation authorities have brought to their communities."<P>

"While we are celebrating 50 years of community-based watershed conservation in 1996, more importantly, we are looking to the future and the challenge of providing essential watershed services in a rapidly changing fiscal environment," said 
Gerry Houston, Chair of the Association of Conservation Authorities.<P>

"The government will continue to work with conservation authorities and municipalities to further define their roles, and to achieve efficient service delivery, while ensuring that Ontario's tradition of watershed-based resource management is maintained and strengthened in the years to come," said Mr. Hodgson.<P>

In celebration of the 50th anniversary, the ACAO is planning events and activities over the next six months.<P>

<B>Province Adopts Strategy to Enhance<BR>
Environmental Protection in Temagami

</B>

</CENTER><P>
The province today announced a comprehensive land-use strategy for the Temagami area that will increase environmental protection, protect more old growth sites and resolve long-standing land-use issues.<P>

"Our government has promised fair and common-sense principles for meeting the objectives of environmental protection in Temagami," said Natural Resources Minister Chris Hodgson.  "This 
land-use strategy sets up a framework that will protect the environment, improve community stability and, after years of uncertainty, get on with the job of enhancing the quality of life in the Temagami area."<P>

Through the land-use strategy, MNR will create Protected Areas that prohibit resource extraction and Special Management Areas that require careful management of resource extraction.  In both areas MNR will allow and encourage recreation and tourism.  These areas will provide additional protection around Lady Evelyn-Smoothwater Provincial Park.  Together these areas total 300,000 hectares, an area about three times the size of the 100,000 hectares of forests and waters protected in seven provincial parks in the Temagami area.<P>

The province developed its comprehensive strategy from the 39 recommendations the Comprehensive Planning Council (CPC) presented to the government in April.<P>

"The CPC and predecessors spent nearly a decade undertaking extensive consultation with the public and studying land-use issues before recommending locally developed solutions," Mr. Hodgson said.<P>

The province's strategy adopts 22 of the CPC recommendations without change and adopts the other 17 recommendations with minor changes.<P>

As part of the strategy, the province will protect an additional 2,628 hectares of old growth red and white pine and will also protect the 3,520 hectare North Obabika site, which includes 939 hectares of old growth red and white pine.  Protected old growth red and white pine sites will cover 10,800 hectares in provincial parks, the Lake Temagami skyline reserve and a new protection zone.<P>

"This government recognizes the importance of old growth forests.  That's why we've increased the area of protected old growth red and white pine," Mr. Hodgson said.  "We also recognize the importance of protecting headwaters in the Lady Evelyn-Smoothwater park area and through the strategy we have added the necessary safeguards."<P>

The province has also acknowledged the need to resolve outstanding issues with local aboriginal communities.  To provide the opportunity for resolution, the province has set aside lands that could form part of a land claim settlement.  The Ontario Native Affairs Secretariat will pursue a resolution over the next two years.<P>

"We want to improve the quality of life for all communities in the Temagami area and that is why we have included in this strategy significant measures that allow us to work out agreements with local aboriginal communities," Mr. Hodgson said.<P>

Through the new strategy, MNR will establish four new land use zones in the Temagami area.  These zones were recommended by the CPC.  They are:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Protected Areas where logging, mineral and aggregate extraction are not permitted
<LI>Special Management Areas where resource extraction will be allowed under special prescriptions to ensure protection of significant resource values
<LI>Integrated Management Areas where resource extraction and development will be carefully managed and public access will be less restricted than in the Protected and Special Management areas
<LI>Developed Areas where resource management will be permitted and controlled to ensure it is compatible with other uses.
</UL>
MNR will also spend until September 30 working with local interests to examine a new governance structure for Temagami as part of the ministry's acceptance of the CPC recommendation on this issue.<P>

As a result of the implementation of the new comprehensive strategy, staking of new mining claims will be allowed to resume in areas identified for resource development.  Following a notice period, staking will begin September 17.  The notice period will be longer than the usual 60-day period to notify claim holders of the re-opening and to produce new, up-to-date maps for use by claim seekers.<P>

<B>Hodgson Announces $929,000 For Etobicoke Lakeshore
</B>

</CENTER><P>
TORONTO -- Natural Resources Minister Chris Hodgson today announced that Ontario will provide $929,000 in funding this year for a project to redevelop the City of Etobicoke's motel strip, bringing the province's total commitment to about $4 million.<P>
	
"Etobicoke Motel Strip Park will become an important new green space on the city's lakeshore, and will form a link in the Lake Ontario Waterfront Trail that is currently being developed across the Greater Toronto Area," Mr. Hodgson said.<P>

The project -- which received approval in 1992 and will cost an estimated 
$8.3 million -- involves the creation of the park, a nine-hectare (13-acre) green space on the south side of Lakeshore Boulevard West between Park Lawn Road and Palace Pier Court.  The province has contributed close to $4 million to date toward the project, with matching funds provided by the City of Etobicoke, the Metropolitan Toronto and Region Conservation Authority and the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto.<P>

Mr. Hodgson noted that the provincial funding will be used to help create the park, protect the Lake Ontario shoreline, improve the near-shore fisheries habitat and build an innovative treatment facility to improve the quality of storm water discharged into Lake Ontario from the local community.<P>

<B>MNR Urges Caution with Fireworks on Canada Day Weekend 
</B>

</CENTER><P>
Given the current serious forest fire situation in Northern Ontario, the Ministry of Natural Resources is asking the public to use caution when setting off fireworks this Canada Day weekend.<P>

"The forest fire situation in the north is serious enough to warrant the province's commitment of 4,100 firefighters and support staff to suppress the more than 175 forest fires currently burning," said Natural Resources Minister Chris Hodgson. "We call upon people in communities with severe fire hazard conditions to use extreme caution if they decide to set off fireworks."<P>

Local municipal bylaws may apply regarding the setting off of fireworks.  Members of the public should contact their local municipality before planning any event using fireworks.  MNR is also reminding the public that they are responsible for any fire resulting from fireworks, and that they could be fined or charged under the Forest Fires Prevention Act if their actions result in a forest fire.<P> 

A Restricted Fire Zone (RFZ) will continue to be in effect in the West Fire Region over the Canada Day weekend, or until fire hazard conditions are significantly reduced.  The Restricted Fire Zone for the East Fire Region is scheduled to expire at midnight, June 26, 1996.<P>   

For the exact boundaries of these areas, the public should contact their local MNR office.<P>

Under the RFZ regulation, all burning permits are suspended and all open fires are prohibited, including campfires.  The regulation does permit the use of a portable stove or charcoal installation but the public is asked to exercise caution.<P>

<B>MNR Moves to Conserve Fisheries Resource




</B>

</CENTER><P>
Natural Resources Minister Chris Hodgson announced that the ministry plans to manage commercial fishing by issuing commercial fishing licences to two Aboriginal communities in the waters around the Bruce Peninsula.<P>

"In keeping with its commitment to finding a resource management solution that is fair and equitable, and which respects the legal rights of First Nations, MNR is instituting a regulated system that we believe fairly accommodates these rights.  At the same time, it will provide for a healthy, sustainable fishery that will benefit all the people of Ontario," said Mr. Hodgson.<P>

Mr. Justice Fairgrieve's 1993 decision regarding Aboriginal fishing in Lake Huron and Georgian Bay accepted the Crown's right to regulate fishing for the purposes of conservation and resource management, and that the Aboriginal right to fish was not an exclusive right.<P>

Through the commercial licences, the ministry is providing the two First Nations 50 per cent of the commercially allowable Bruce Peninsula catch. This is equivalent to approximately 540,000 kilograms (1.2 million pounds) of fish, mostly whitefish and chub.  Chinook salmon, rainbow trout and brown trout are not included in any provincial commercial allocations.<P>

"The ministry is providing  a fair and reasonable allocation to First Nation commercial fishers in the waters around the Bruce Peninsula," Mr. Hodgson said. <P> 

Since 1993, MNR has spent approximately $2 million on commercial fishing buyouts and leasebacks for the waters surrounding the Bruce Peninsula. In addition, the ministry spent $400,000 on pre-negotiation discussions which took place with the two First Nations in 1994 and 1995.<P>

"We would have preferred a negotiated arrangement with the two First Nations.  However, the reasonable efforts by both this government and the previous one, including the provisions of thousands of dollars to support discussions with the First Nations, were unsuccessful." Mr. Hodgson said.<P>

MNR will regulate the Bruce Peninsula Aboriginal fishery by issuing a commercial fishing licence under the Aboriginal Communal Fishing Licences Regulations (ACFLR), a mechanism designed by the federal government following the Supreme Court of Canada <B>Sparrow</B> decision.  The ACFLR are applicable in Quebec and Ontario, as well as in federally managed fisheries across the country.  They also permit the First Nations flexibility and are best suited to communal use, while ensuring that the commercial fishery is regulated, and fish stocks are protected.<P>

MNR has been in discussion with the First Nations regarding fishery management for three years without reaching a negotiated solution.  This decision is unique to the area and does not affect other First Nations in the province.<P>

In the recent <B>R v. Nikal</B> case, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that licensing is a necessary first step to the preservation and management of the fisheries resources and that licensing will not of itself constitute an infringement of Aboriginal rights.<P>

<B>Rabies Prevention Program 
in the Greater Toronto Area




</B>

</CENTER><P>
The Ministry of Natural Resources will live-trap and vaccinate raccoons and skunks in Scarborough and place vaccine baits for foxes in greenbelt areas and ravines between Hamilton and Oshawa as part of a continuing program to control rabies.<P>

The Scarborough program will run from July 2 through to the end of August, while the fox baiting program will run from July 8 through to the end of September.<P>

The trap-vaccinate-release (TVR) program in Scarborough will cover a 
60-square-kilometre area bounded by Highway 401 to the north, Lake Ontario to the south, Victoria Park Avenue to the west, and Markham Road to the east.<P>

"We have assigned 10 ministry staff to the Scarborough TVR area," said Natural Resources Minister Chris Hodgson.  "They will be setting live-traps, and all captured raccoons and skunks will be tagged for identification, vaccinated against rabies by injection, then released."<P>

MNR is asking the public to leave the traps alone, especially if they contain animals.  The traps will be checked regularly. <P>

The Scarborough TVR program has been so successful that the 60-square-kilometre area has been free of rabies in skunks for more than seven years. Data collected from the program has also enabled the ministry to develop a strategy to keep raccoon rabies out of Ontario.  That strategy is being used along the Niagara and St. Lawrence rivers to block the spread of raccoon rabies into Ontario.<P>

The fox vaccine-bait program covers an area from Hamilton to Oshawa.  The northern boundary from Hamilton to Mississauga is Highway 5.  From Mississauga to Pickering the northern boundary is Major Mackenzie Drive, and from Pickering to Oshawa the northern boundary is Taunton Road. <P>

MNR staff and volunteers will place 40,000 chicken/cod baits containing rabies vaccine in ravines and near fox dens.  Each bait carries a label that reads, "Rabies Vaccine, 
DO NOT EAT," and MNR is asking the public not to touch the packets.<P>

The vaccine is not harmful to humans or to pets and other animals.  However, it will not protect pets and other animals from rabies.  Pet owners should ensure that their pets are properly vaccinated against rabies.<P>
	
Since the fox vaccine baiting program started in 1989, there have been only three cases of rabies in foxes in the Greater Toronto Area.  Metro has been free of rabid foxes for two years.<P>

The goal of the ministry's rabies vaccine programs is to immunize between 60 and 70 per cent of the target animal population against rabies.  MNR research shows that if a high percentage of animals are immunized, a rabies outbreak does not take hold in the animal population.<P>

<B>MNR Expands Restricted Fire Zone
</B>

</CENTER><P>




       

      Because of extremely dry forest conditions, combined with the high
        number of fires already burning across Ontario, the Ministry of Natural
        Resources has significantly expanded the Restricted Fire Zone (RFZ)
        currently in effect in Ontario.<P>

        "Effective midnight tonight, the Restricted Fire Zone now will include
        the MNR districts of Sault Ste. Marie, Sudbury, North Bay, and all of
        Manitoulin Island," said Natural Resources Minister Chris Hodgson.
        "This is a serious fire situation and we are using all our resources to
        control it."<P>

        The RFZ, first introduced at noon Friday June 14, covers all of
        northwestern Ontario and those parts of northeastern Ontario located
        north of a line running from the Quebec border at Mattawa and along
        Highway 17 and the French River.<P><P>

        There are currently more than 200 fires burning in the province,
        covering an area of about 230,000 hectares. Sixty-one of these fires
are considered problem fires. There have been more than 370 new forest
        fires reported in Ontario between Tuesday June 11 and Tuesday June 18.<P>

        "Our provincial fire program is responding efficiently and quickly to
        ensure human safety and the protection of valuable resources," said
        Mr. Hodgson. "I'm pleased that the forest industry is also pitching in
        by curtailing a lot of its regular harvest activities, and providing
        suppression assistance with crews and heavy equipment," Mr. Hodgson
        added.<P>

        Under the RFZ regulation, all burning permits are suspended and all
        open fires are prohibited, including fires for cooking or warmth.  The
        regulation does permit the use of portable stoves or charcoal
        installations, but the public is asked to exercise caution.<P>

        "High temperatures and windy conditions, which cause erratic and
        dangerous fire behavior, are expected to continue for the next few
        days," Mr. Hodgson said.  "The danger of new forest fires starting will
        remain extremely high. We are seeking the public's cooperation in
        helping to prevent any new starts as a result of  human activity."<P>

<B>Antlerless Deer Tag Draw:<BR>  New Telephone Application System On-Line June 17



</B>

</CENTER><P>
To help improve customer service, hunters can apply for the draw for antlerless deer validation tags by telephone, Natural Resources Minister Chris Hodgson announced today.<P>

"This new 1-900 telephone application system will make the 1996 antlerless deer validation tag draw more efficient and cost-effective," said Mr. Hodgson.  "Hunters can still apply by mail, the way they always have, but the telephone system offers many advantages over the mail application system." <P>

"Results will be available faster than ever before," Mr. Hodgson added.  "Starting September 3, hunters can dial a dedicated 1-800 toll-free number to find out if they have received an antlerless deer tag."<P>

The telephone numbers are contained in a brochure that has been mailed to all deer hunters who have applied at least once for the draw during the last three years. The brochure explains in detail how to access the telephone application system and includes a worksheet to help applicants prepare all the information they will need when they make the call to the 1-900 line.  A $5.10 fee is charged for every call and it will appear on the caller's next telephone bill.<P>

The telephone application system opens at 7:00 a.m. (EDT) on June 17 and closes at midnight (EDT) on July 31. Hunters can apply from home seven days a week, 24 hours a day. The service is available in English and French, at two different numbers.<P>

"All you need is your valid hunting-version Outdoors Card number and the numbers of your first and second choice Wildlife Management Units (WMUs)"  Mr. Hodgson said.  "Another feature of the telephone system that hunters will like is that they don't need to buy a deer licence before the draw.  They will have to buy a licence if they have drawn a tag and wish to hunt an antlerless deer or an antlered deer."<P>

Hunters can access this system with a rotary-dial telephone or a touch-tone. Hunters should note that cordless phones, radio phones, cellular phones and pay phones will not work with the system.<P>

<B>Illegal To Buy Or Sell Spawn<BR> 
From Angler-Caught Fish



</B>

</CENTER><P>
Under an amendment to the <I>Game and Fish Act</I>, anglers who fish anywhere in Ontario are prohibited from selling the spawn of fish caught.  It is also illegal for anyone, including baitfish dealers, to purchase spawn from anglers. <P>

The amendment to Section 72, which took effect January 1, 1996, states that: "Except under the authority of a licence and in accordance with the regulations, no person shall sell, offer for sale, purchase, barter, culture or be concerned in the sale, purchase, barter or culture of fish other than species designated in the regulation."<P>

Fish spawn can only be sold by a licensed aquaculturist.  Bait fish dealers can purchase spawn from licensed aquaculturalists for resale to anglers.<P>

This new regulation will protect natural fish populations in Ontario's lakes and rivers by prohibiting anglers from harvesting fish for commercial gain.<P>

<B>MNR Declares Restricted Fire Zone
For Most Of Northern Ontario</B>

</CENTER><P>
A Restricted Fire Zone (RFZ) will be in effect across all of northwest and parts of northeast Ontario starting at noon today.<P>

"The fire situation is reaching extreme levels and is now affecting most of Northern Ontario," said Natural Resources Minister Chris Hodgson. "We are introducing the RFZ to reduce the risk of person-caused fires at a time when there are increasing demands on our fire fighting resources."<P>

The RFZ covers all of northwestern Ontario and, in the east, all lands north of a line running from the Quebec border just south of New Liskeard and running through Gogoma, Chapleau, and Wawa, and south of the Albany River.  For the exact boundaries of each of these areas, the public should call their local MNR office.<P>

"The situation is not as critical in the east as it is in northwestern Ontario, but the high number of lightning starts, combined with high winds and continuing hot, dry weather are forcing us to take preventative measures across most of the north," Mr. Hodgson said.<P>

Currently, there are 249 active fires in Ontario, most of them in the northwest, involving  approximately 31,200 hectares of forest lands.<P>

Under the RFZ regulation, all burning permits are suspended and all open fires are prohibited, including campfires.  The regulation does permit the use of a portable stove or charcoal installation but the public is asked to exercise caution.<P>

"With the Forest Fire Weather Index reaching extreme levels, we need the public's cooperation to ensure that no new fires are started in and around forest areas," added Mr. Hodgson.

<B>Ontario Plans to Continue Raccoon Vaccination Program


</B>

</CENTER><P>
MNR will vaccinate raccoons again this year along the Niagara River and in an area along the St. Lawrence River to prevent raccoon rabies from entering Ontario.<P>

The trap-vaccinate-release (TVR) program is scheduled to take place between June and November this year.  Under the two TVR programs, raccoons will be trapped, vaccinated and released within a 680-square-kilometre area between the Welland Canal and the Niagara River, and along an area 3 to 10 kilometres deep on the St. Lawrence River.<P>

"Trained MNR staff will conduct the TVR programs by setting up live traps," said Natural Resources Minister Chris Hodgson. "Captured raccoons, skunks and foxes will be tagged for identification, vaccinated by injection with rabies vaccine, then released.  Ministry staff will check the traps every morning."<P>
	
MNR is asking the public to leave the traps alone, especially if they contain animals.<P>

To date, there are no confirmed cases of raccoon rabies in Ontario.  However, raccoon rabies has been reported in New York State, along the banks of the Niagara River, and within 
10 kilometres of the St. Lawrence River in an area across from Gananoque.<P>

This will be the third year for the TVR program in the Niagara area.  During the 1995 season, MNR captured 75 per cent of the raccoon population in that area.  It is the second year for the TVR program in the St. Lawrence region, which has also been identified as a likely entry point for raccoon rabies.<P> 

For the second year, a study which involves testing blood samples from a number of wild raccoons for signs of certain viruses, will be conducted in the TVR areas of the St. Lawrence and the whole Niagara Peninsula.  Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada requires that this study be done before any consideration can be given to using oral rabies vaccines for raccoons.  Oral vaccine is currently being tested in the United States as an approach to preventing rabies in raccoons and other wildlife.<P>

Contingency plans have been developed by MNR and its partners on the province's Raccoon Rabies Task Force should raccoon rabies be reported in areas other than those with TVR programs.  A provincial contingency plan is also in place if raccoon rabies should enter Ontario.<P>

As well, the Ministry of Natural Resources is continuing its work on eliminating fox rabies in Ontario this year.  Since 1989, aerial baiting programs have taken place throughout the province and, by 2001, MNR expects to have eliminated fox rabies from Ontario.<P>

A rabies hotline with two toll-free numbers is available to the public for direct and immediate access to information on rabies.<P>

<B>Algoma, Wawa Forest Companies Unite<BR> to Apply for Sustainable Forest Licence 

</B>

</CENTER><P>


Five Sault Ste. Marie area forest companies today advised the Ministry of Natural Resources that they are in a position to negotiate a Sustainable Forest Licence (SFL) for the Algoma and Wawa Management Units.<P>

A shareholders' agreement between St. Marys Paper Ltd., AGAWA Forest Products Ltd., Midway Lumber Mills Ltd., Jager Strandboard Limited Partnership, and Levesque Plywood Ltd., will pave the way for the companies to apply to MNR for an SFL.<P>

"The shareholders agreement is a major step toward the development of Sustainable Forest Licences for the Algoma and Wawa management units," said Natural Resources Minister            Chris Hodgson.  "This is part of our new business relationship with the forest industry that will ensure the long-term sustainability of resources and forest-dependent communities."<P>
  
An SFL is a 20-year renewable licence through which the licensee becomes responsible for all aspects of forest management planning and renewal.  In return, the licence provides the company with access to a long-term wood supply and greater control over forest operations and planning activities.  The company also has its own account in the Forest Renewal Trust fund.  With this fund, a portion of the harvesting fees paid by the company are collected for future silvicultural works on its SFL management unit.<P> 	

"Our companies are committed to sustainable forestry and are ready, willing and able to assume our new responsibilities," said Mike Barker, spokesperson for the companies.<P>
	
The licence applicants will submit a detailed business plan including their specific goals and responsibilities for forest operations and planning activities, as well as business and financial information in support of their proposal. Once draft plans for the  Algoma and Wawa units are completed and accepted by MNR, they will form the basis for the proposed SFL.<P>

"Prior to approving an SFL on the Wawa and Algoma Management Units, MNR will want to be satisfied that existing wood commitments to the industry will continue to be met, and that the arrangements put in place for existing smaller companies and operators are fair," said Wawa  District Manager Quentin Day.<P> 

The proposed SFLs will undergo a 30-day public review. The public will be invited to participate through media notices, a public advertisement, letters to local stakeholders groups, and public meetings.<P>

<B>New Partnership for Fur Management in Ontario

</B>

</CENTER><P>
Natural Resources Minister Chris Hodgson today announced that MNR will officially recognize the Ontario Fur Managers Federation (OFMF) as the provincial organization representing the interests of licensed trappers.<P>

"The Ministry will begin immediately to develop and negotiate a new business relationship with the Federation," said Mr. Hodgson.  "Partnerships such as this are an example of the government's new way of doing business.<P>  

"This partnership will continue to position Ontario as a leading jurisdiction in resource management in North America," added Mr. Hodgson.<P>

"We represent the interests of 10,500 licensed trappers in Ontario and we are committed to establishing this new business relationship with the Ministry," said Murray Monk, president of the OFMF.  "Fur harvesting in one of the oldest industries in North America, and this partnership will enable us to move fur management into the next century," Mr. Monk added.<P> 

The OFMF is a grass-roots organization made up of individual trappers, local trapper councils and a board of directors elected by trappers across the province.  The federation is committed to educating and training trappers, harvesting at sustainable levels and working with other groups to ensure the future of the trapping industry.<P>

"We want to ensure that trapping remains a vibrant and sustainable industry in Ontario, one that will continue to be naturally renewable," said Mr. Monk.<P>

"I have assigned Ron Lessard, Sault Ste. Marie District Manager to work with the federation as General Manager to assist in development of the new business relationship," Mr. Hodgson said.  The federation's head office will be in Sault Ste. Marie.<P>

<B>MNR Sets New Burning Guidelines


</B>

</CENTER><P>

The Ministry of Natural Resources has developed simpler rules for the use of fire that remove the need for people to get a fire permit for small fires within new guidelines.  These guidelines apply to the province's fire regions.
<P>
"We have developed simpler guidelines that clearly outline the types of fires people can set without a permit.  These guidelines apply to lighting a fire for purposes other than cooking or warmth and require the person to keep the fire small and under control at all times," said Natural Resources Minister Chris Hodgson.<P>
 
The new guidelines result from changes to the Forest Fires Prevention Act.  Under these changes, people no longer require a permit for burning grass, leaves, or woody debris, provided the fires fall within the guidelines. People are not allowed to start a small fire during the day, since that's the time of greatest fire risk.  All small fires must now be started no sooner than two hours before sunset, and must be extinguished two hours after sunrise or earlier.  Specific conditions about the size of a fire also apply.  In all cases, a responsible person must attend the fire until it is out, and adequate tools and water to contain the fire must be kept on hand. <P>

"The new guidelines about safe burning times are a significant change from the past since they allow a person to set a small fire without a permit as long as the rules are strictly followed," said Mr. Hodgson.  
"During forest fire season, and when weather conditions are extreme, MNR will still reserve the right to ban all fires."<P>

Anyone wishing to start a small fire under the new guidelines must remember that he or she is fully responsible for that fire.  People must keep the fire under control and comply with the Forest Fires Prevention Act.  Measures under the Act related to safe burning, such as warnings, fines and, or charges, will continue to be in place.<P>

The conditions and specifications for incinerators are still in force, but permits are not required.  However, permits will still be required for any large-scale, open burning.<P>

"The Forest Fires Prevention Act applies within the province's fire regions, including municipalities located within those regions," Mr. Hodgson said.  "The only exception would be if a municipality has a bylaw regulating burning and requires a permit.  In this instance, the bylaw would take precedence."<P>

For more information on municipal bylaws, the public should contact their nearest municipal fire department.  Information on the province's fire regions and the new guidelines is available at MNR District and Area offices.<P>

<B>1996 Provincial Parks Season Has Begun

</B>

</CENTER><P>
This year, most provincial parks in southern Ontario opened on May 10, while in Northern Ontario, opening season for many parks will begin May 17.<P>

As in previous years, an alcohol ban is in place from May 10 to May 20 in selected provincial parks across the province.  (List of provincial parks provided at end of release.)<P>

With the creation of Ontario Parks, visitors will begin to see some changes in how provincial parks are being managed this year.<P>

"Ontario Parks now have a revenue-retention system that ensures money raised at the parks stays within the parks system," said Natural Resources Minister Chris Hodgson.  "Ontario's provincial parks will be operating more like a business as we work with potential partners and sponsors to ensure park visitors receive the services and products they want and need, and to ensure that our parks continue to be the finest in the world."<P>

Ontario's 265 provincial parks cover 6.2 million hectares and attract more than eight million visitors annually.<P>

"The protection of Ontario's natural and cultural heritage within provincial parks continues to be a priority for this government," said Mr. Hodgson.  "As we enter what is expected to be another busy season, I would like to thank the people of Ontario for their ongoing support and interest in Ontario's provincial parks."<P>

The <I>1996 Provincial Parks Guide</I> provides detailed information about Ontario's provincial parks.  The guide will be available soon at provincial parks, MNR offices, Ontario Travel Information centres, and Natural Resources Information Centres in Toronto and Peterborough.<P>

A telephone report on campsite vacancies will be available on weekends only, from Victoria Day to the third weekend in June, then daily until Labour Day, by calling 1-800 ONTARIO (668-2746) or (416) 314-0998 in Toronto. <P>


Information about provincial parks is also available from Travel Ontario offices or by calling their toll-free travel numbers:<P>

<B>Regulatory Restructuring for Aggregates and Petroleum Industries
</B>

</CENTER><P>


Ontario is changing the way it regulates the aggregates and petroleum industries to make industry more accountable for meeting strict provincial standards, Natural Resources Minister Chris Hodgson announced today.<P>

As part of the government's ongoing efforts to eliminate barriers to job creation, the ministry has been working with the Red Tape Review Commission to reduce the impact of its regulations and practices on business growth.<P>

"Changes to the ministry's aggregates and petroleum programs will eliminate red tape and inefficiency, streamline delivery and remove barriers to private sector job creation," said Mr. Hodgson.<P>

"This restructuring will maintain Ontario's leadership in regulating the two industries, and improve MNR's enforcement capability to ensure regulatory compliance," Mr. Hodgson added.<P>

MNR will work with the aggregates industry to develop a compliance partnership where the industry will be responsible for day-to-day site inspections and monitoring, while the ministry will concentrate on auditing and enforcement.<P>

"I am also pleased to announce changes to modernize petroleum regulations and bring them more in line with other jurisdictions," Mr. Hodgson said.
A new type of well licence, for example, will make regulatory and administrative processes more efficient, while making it clear that landowners and well operators are responsible for registering their wells and meeting strict provincial standards.  Changes to the Act will also support enforcement efforts, by increasing the maximum fine for offences under the Petroleum Resources Act to $500,000 from $10,000.<P>

Increased efficiency will also result from the move to simpler, more concise regulations, combined with clearly defined, detailed technical standards.  These standards will allow MNR to be more responsive to emerging issues, while providing the industries with greater clarity about how they should manage their operations. <P> 

These standards will be developed in consultation with industry representatives, and other key stakeholders, and will be similar to current Canadian Standards Association standards governing hydrocarbon storage.

<B>Non-Renewable Resources<BR>
FACT SHEET
</B>

</CENTER><P>
The Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR) is changing the way it regulates Ontario's aggregate, petroleum and brine industries.<P>

Through business planning, MNR has restructured its non-renewable resource programs (aggregates, petroleum and brine) to shift more responsibility for direct program delivery to industry.  MNR will concentrate its core focus on policy development, the setting and enforcement of standards, and approvals of permits and licences.<P>

This new business approach will also involve a shift from complex, detailed legislation and regulations to ones that are simpler and more streamlined, backed by detailed technical standards.  This is similar to the approach taken with the forest industry under the Crown Forests Sustainability Act.<P>

The restructuring of the ministry's non-renewable resources program is consistent with the government's plan to provide better government services at a reasonable price to taxpayers.  It will help to reduce the cost of government, eliminate red tape, and remove barriers to private sector job creation.<P>

The aggregates and petroleum industries will become more accountable for meeting provincial standards.  Through compliance partnerships, responsibility for day-to-day site inspections and monitoring will be transferred to industry. <P> 

MNR will be responsible for auditing industry operations to ensure compliance with legislation and standards, and for enforcing the law in situations of non-compliance.  The revised Acts enhance enforcement through increased fines, longer licence suspensions and a longer time period to initiate prosecution.  Companies, agencies and individuals will remain liable for their actions.<P>
<BR>
<B>Changes to Aggregates Industry Regulation</B>
<UL>
<LI>Detailed guidelines will be provided in technical standards, which will be developed in consultation with industry and other key stakeholders.  They will be published and available to all stakeholders and will provide greater clarity than the current regulations.<P>


<LI>Industry will be responsible for day-to-day site inspections and monitoring to ensure compliance with legislation, regulations and standards.  Industry will be required to submit compliance reports to the ministry and will be held legally accountable for the accuracy of those reports.  MNR will verify the accuracy of reports through random auditing.  Two pilot projects in 1995 proved very successful in ensuring compliance. <P> 


<LI>Public authority and personal aggregate permits will be eliminated to help facilitate streamlining of the program. Currently public authority and personal permits have a restriction which prohibits the resale of extracted material. Permit holders will now be able to obtain a new aggregate permit if they can meet applicable standards.  If they are unable to meet the standards, they will have to get their aggregate from another licensed operation.<P>

<LI>In keeping with the trust fund model developed in the Crown Forest Sustainability Act, a trustee will assume responsibility for the functions associated with the aggregates trust fund. The trust has been established to collect and disburse annual licence fees; administer the Abandoned Pits and Quarries Rehabilitation Fund; and, administer a new pooled trust fund to provide for rehabilitation where aggregate permits and licences have been revoked as a result of default (e.g. bankruptcy).<P>

<LI>The Aggregate Producers Association of Ontario will be responsible for the administration and delivery of the rehabilitation program associated with the Abandoned Pits and Quarries Rehabilitation Fund.
</UL><P><BR>
<B>Changes to Regulation of the Petroleum and Brine Industries</B>
<UL>
<LI>Similar to the aggregates industry, legislation and regulations governing the petroleum and brine (salt solution mining) industries will be streamlined and simplified.  Operational standards will be developed to provide detailed, technical guidelines for the industry.  These standards will be similar to the current Canadian Standards Association standard for hydrocarbon storage.<P>

<LI>MNR will continue to conduct field inspections with strengthened powers. For example, inspectors will have the authority to order the plugging of wells.<P>

Private inspectors, certified by the ministry, will also be used. This combination will provide a solid framework to guarantee operations are complying with Ontario's environmental standards.<P>


<LI>The revised Petroleum Resources Act enhances enforcement, including increasing fines (to a maximum of $500,000 from $10,000) and extending the time period for initiating prosecution.<P>

<LI>The current well permit system, which only addresses the regulatory functions associated with drilling, will be changed to a life-cycle well licence.  This will require adherence to operational standards for the life of the well, from the initiation of well drilling to the final plugging and abandonment.  The activities covered include drilling, production, maintenance, and change in well status or purpose.  A life-cycle well licence will eliminate the need for annual production and rig licences and special brine well permits under the Mining Act.<P>

<LI>A new trust account funded by industry will pay for the operation of the geological core and chip library managed by MNR, ensuring the continuation of this information and research service to the industry and academic institutions. <P>

<B>May is Rabies Awareness Month
</B>

</CENTER><P>
May is Rabies Awareness Month, a comprehensive government and community partnership to educate Ontarians about the threat of rabies. <P> 
            
Co-sponsors of the program include the Ontario ministries of Natural Resources (MNR), Health, and Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, as well as Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, the Ontario Veterinary Medical Association and the Six Nations of the Grand River.  <P> 

"The fight against rabies is important," said Chris Hodgson, Ontario's Minister of Natural Resources.  "We must take every precaution to ensure that all strains of rabies will eventually be controlled," Mr. Hodgson added. <P> 
 
This year's rabies awareness program focuses on cats and how they can spread rabies to humans. During May, local Community Contingency Planning Teams will be organizing activities to educate the public on rabies and rabies prevention. <P> 
 
The best protection against rabies is for people to ensure their pets are vaccinated and kept away from stray domestic or wild animals. If they suspect that they, or their pets, may have come in contact with a rabid animal, they should call their doctor or veterinarian immediately. <P> 
 
Cats left outside, especially at night, may come into contact with foxes and other wild animals such as raccoons. Rabies experts suggest keeping cats indoors, or on a leash, especially in the evening. Cats and dogs should also wear a collar which properly identifies their owner.  <P> 

There is an ongoing concern that raccoon rabies -- which has been identified on the New York State side of the Niagara River, and within 10 kilometres of the 
St. Lawrence river near Gananoque -- may enter Ontario.  <P> 

A raccoon immunization program, called Trap-Vaccinate-Release  (TVR), has created a buffer zone against raccoon rabies in that portion of Ontario between the Niagara River and the Welland Canal.  Additional buffer zones have also been created at bridges along the Ontario side of the St. Lawrence River, where infected raccoons could enter from New York State.  <P>  

Through this program, raccoons are live-trapped, vaccinated, ear-tagged and released.  MNR hopes that the TVR program will contain or slow the spread of raccoon rabies. <P> 
 
MNR's Rabies Research Unit has also developed a contingency plan on how any potential spread of raccoon rabies will be contained in areas where the animals have not been vaccinated. This could occur where raccoons with rabies enter Ontario as "stowaways" on transport trucks, recreational vehicles or boats.  <P> 

The Ministry of Natural Resources is also continuing its work on eliminating fox rabies in Ontario.  Since 1989, aerial baiting programs have taken place throughout the province and, by 2001, MNR expects to have eliminated fox rabies in Ontario. <P> 
            
For more information on rabies, please call toll-free at 1-800-461-2036 (general line). The number for persons with impaired hearing is 1-800-387-5559.

<B>MNR Congratulates Winner of the 1995 Greg Clark Award
</B>

</CENTER><P>

Rick Charles is the winner of the 19th annual Greg Clark Outdoor Writing Award sponsored by the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources.<P>

Mr. Charles won the award for an article on lake trout entitled "Save the Lakers", which was published in the Fishing 1995 edition of  Outdoor Canada magazine.<P>

"I congratulate Mr. Charles on winning this award and I commend him on his choice of subject," said Natural Resources Minister Chris Hodgson.  "It is important for us to find ways to protect the province's trout populations.  Through the activities of anglers and fish and game clubs, and the use of proper angling and live-release techniques,  I am confident we can preserve trout populations in Ontario."<P>

The Greg Clark Outdoor Writing Award commemorates the late Greg Clark, a prominent conservationist and outdoor writer whose career as a reporter, columnist, humorist and story-teller spanned almost 60 years.  The competition was administered by the Canadian Science Writers' Association.<P>  

The article detailed the importance of lake trout as both a national fish, and as a popular fish in Ontario.  It also informed readers about the considerable interest this species has generated in the angling community and how it is valued from both an ecological and economic standpoint.  
Mr. Charles describes the concerns over declining lake trout populations in Ontario, and explains how the Ministry of Natural Resources and some U.S. states are looking into ways of sustaining the trout population.<P>	

"I am especially honored to receive the Greg Clark award," said Mr. Charles. "Mr. Clark has been an idol of mine for many years, and his writing has been an inspiration to me as I am sure it is to many writers.  I am currently working on a series of short stories.  As I write, I try to keep the spirit of Greg Clark alive by adopting his approach to outdoors storytelling, humour and reflections on life," he added.<P>

Mr. Charles works as a full-time freelance writer.  He spent most of his professional career in Toronto as an on-air broadcaster and news director as well as a national anchor for Broadcast News and Canadian Press.  He has also taught broadcasting at Humber College in Etobicoke. <P>

<B>North American Award for Ontario Conservation Officers
</B>

</CENTER><P>

Two Ontario Conservation Officers have received the prestigious Shikar-Safari International Wildlife Officer of the Year Award for outstanding achievements in wildlife conservation in Ontario.<P>

The award recognizes Conservation Officers James A. Abbott, Timmins District, and David Arbour, Kemptville District, for their accomplishments in dealing with crimes against wildlife through the Crime Stoppers Program in Ontario.<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="shikar.gif"></CENTER><P>
"I congratulate Jim Abbott and Dave Arbour for their excellent work with Crime Stoppers," said Natural Resources Minister Chris Hodgson.  "They have contributed greatly to our goal of protecting Ontario's wildlife."<P>

The two Conservation Officers have been working jointly since 1991, actively promoting Crime Stoppers in their respective areas and across the province. In 1994, the two were invited to join the Ontario Advisory Board (OAB) of Crime Stoppers as MNR provincial representatives.<P>

"Through its association with Crime Stoppers, MNR has entered a new era of community-based law enforcement," said Mr. Abbott.  "Increased public participation over the last five years has resulted in a more effective approach by the ministry to crimes against wildlife."<P>

"We have received tremendous response from all stakeholders," said Mr. Arbour.  
"We want to acknowledge members of the community at large for their enthusiastic participation from the very start.  We also thank our superiors and colleagues in MNR for their continued support." <P>

Crime Stoppers is a non-profit organization relying solely on community support such as fund-raising.  The program receives no government funding.<P>

Based on a partnership between the community, media, law-enforcement agencies, and members of the public, Crime Stoppers invites anyone with information on a crime to report it to the local program.  If the information leads to an arrest, the caller is eligible for a reward while being ensured of complete anonymity.<P>

<B>MNR Minister Chris Hodgson Lifts Ban On Prescribed Burning
</B>

</CENTER><P>

Natural Resources Minister Chris Hodgson announced today that he has lifted the ban on prescribed burning in Ontario.<P>
         
"I am satisfied that the implementation of the recommendations from the review carried out last fall will result in enhanced safety procedures and effectiveness, within Ontario's prescribed burn (PB) program," said Mr. Hodgson.<P>
         
Mr. Hodgson immediately requested a review of prescribed burns and placed a ban on such burns last summer after two burns in the Wawa area escaped their boundaries.<P>
         
A Prescribed Burn Review Committee, which included representatives from the MNR, the Fire Marshal's Office, the municipality of Dubreuilville, Hearst Forest Management Inc. and the Canadian Forestry Service, presented recommendations in December for improvements in the management of prescribed burns.<P>
         
The recommendations included earlier identification of problem fires; a revised and more extensive PB planning manual for fire managers; and improved weather monitoring and long-term forecasting.<P>

This year MNR and its clients plan 35 prescribed burns involving a total area of approximately 4,500 hectares.  The burns are primarily for site preparation for silviculture, ecosystem restoration, vegetation management and wildlife habitat enhancement.  They range in size from one hectare burns for ecosystem restoration in southern Ontario, to a 1,400-hectare site preparation burn in Northern Ontario.<P> 
         
"The use of prescribed burning as an effective and efficient forest and ecological management tool is widely recognized but it is not without a degree of risk,"           Mr. Hodgson said. "However, I am very confident that with the implementation of the recommendations we have further minimized any such risks."<P>

<B>Prescribed Burn Program<BR>
FACT SHEET
</B>

</CENTER><P>

In the final report presented last fall, the review of Ontario's prescribed burn (PB) program made 17 recommendations to the Minister of Natural Resources. The implementation of these recommendations have been summarized into four sections:  Operations, Planning, Communications, and Future Development.<P>
 
<B>Operations:</B>  Ontario's PB program now recognizes "problematic control" as a potential fourth stage of prescribed burning.  This is defined as a condition when the prescribed burn (during any of its three stages of ignition, control or demobilization) is not developing as planned and the fire could potentially escape or consume more resources and funds than was planned.<P>

Specific criteria have been developed to invoke more aggressive action to extinguish the burn once this declaration has been made.<P>
 
<B>Planning:</B>  A complete review of the Prescribed Burn planning manual this past winter has resulted in the preparation of a revised interim manual.  This will be replaced in June by a final version which incorporates the recommendations of the review committee.<P>
 
New planning initiatives cover: criteria to be used in the planning process that will direct more aggressive control and management; planned contingencies for fires that go beyond prescribed boundaries, and which also may have environmental impacts;  specific directions for communicating with communities in close proximity to burn projects.<P>

<B>Communications:</B>  A more structured approach to communications both internally and externally has been developed.  The communications section of the PB planning manual has been greatly expanded, and places greater emphasis on communications after ignition and during problematic control.<P>

<B>Future Development:</B>  The PB program has upgraded internal weather forecasts through a new agreement with Atmospheric Environment Services, which also includes enhanced long-term forecasting and application.  MNR's Fire Science and Technology Unit is also evaluating new developments in the field of infrared scanning technology, and their application to fire operations.

<CENTER><B>Ontario Parks - A New Approach To Park Management In Ontario</B></CENTER><P>

Natural Resources Minister Chris Hodgson today announced the launch of Ontario Parks, marking the beginning of a new era in the 100-year history of provincial parks in Ontario.<P>

"With the creation of Ontario Parks, the government is charting a bold new course in park management in Ontario," said Mr. Hodgson.  "As an organization within MNR, Ontario Parks will operate like a business.  It will work closely with business partners, and provide our customers with the products and services they want and need.  Most of all, it will ensure that Ontario's provincial parks system remains one of the finest in the world." <P>

Mr. Hodgson made the announcement this morning at the official opening of the new Sandbanks Provincial Park entrance way.<P>

Ontario Parks is the first entrepreneurial program of its kind in the Ontario Government.  It is designed to maintain the goals and objectives of the existing parks system while managing the parks more efficiently.  It will be accountable to the Minister through a newly-appointed board of directors, and will develop a "special purpose account" for retaining and managing park revenues.<P>

"Maintaining our parks system and protecting Ontario's irreplaceable natural heritage is a priority with this government, and a core responsibility for MNR," said Mr. Hodgson.  "The new organization will provide opportunities for the private sector and allow the provincial parks system to continue to prosper in a challenging fiscal environment.<P>

"Ontario Parks will ensure that the parks system continues as a provincial showcase, enhancing tourism and business objectives for Ontario," Mr. Hodgson added.<P>

<CENTER><B>Ontario Parks - A New Business Model for Ontario's Provincial Parks<BR>
FACT SHEET
</B></CENTER><P><BR>

The objective of creating <B>Ontario Parks</B> is to improve the delivery of programs and services in key parks to increase revenues and, in turn, to sustain other parks.<P>

<B>Ontario Parks Mandate</B><P>

<CENTER><I>"To protect, plan, develop and manage Ontario's system of <BR>provincial parks while improving their self-reliance."</I></CENTER><P>

This includes helping the province to establish new provincial parks and to safeguard the unique cultural, recreational and natural features of the provincial parks system through responsible land use planning.<P><BR>

<B>Ontario Parks</B> will fulfil this mandate by providing a variety of outdoors recreational opportunities to the public and providing natural and cultural heritage protection within the park system.<P>

There are four objectives for the provincial parks program:<P>
<UL>
<LI>the protection of significant elements of our natural and cultural landscape
<LI>the opportunity for exploration and appreciation of our natural and cultural heritage
<LI>the provision of recreational opportunities, ranging from day use to wilderness experiences
<LI>the encouragement of economic benefits through tourism.
</UL><BR>
<B>Ontario Parks</B> will balance the wants and needs of visitors for new services and programs, with a continued commitment to natural and cultural heritage protection.<P><BR>

<B>Business Objectives</B><P>

<B>Ontario Parks</B> has set the following business objectives:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Provide strong leadership in natural and cultural protection.
<LI>Improve customer service and market our products and services effectively.
<LI>Move toward financial self-reliance in the parks.
<LI>Operate more like a business.
<LI>Build management and workforce excellence in business operations.
<LI>Be a leader in building a new business model in government.
<LI>Involve the private sector in program delivery, from service contracts to park contracting to partnerships.
</UL><BR>
<B>Business Plan</B><P>
<UL>
<LI>A brand name for Ontario's provincial parks: <B>Ontario Parks</B>
<LI>A new visual identity will be developed.
<LI>The Minister of Natural Resources has the authority to establish a new board of directors.  The board will be chaired by the Deputy Minister.  It will have members from outside the Ontario government with interests in areas such as the environment, tourism, business, finance and education.
<LI>A special purpose account for retaining and managing park revenues (fees, licences, permits, rentals) will be developed.  It will improve customer service, maximize revenues and make park operations more efficient and accountable.
<LI><B>Ontario Parks</B> will be able to set or change park fees and charges, subject to the Minister's approval.
</UL><BR>
<B>Financial Projections</B><P>

<B>Ontario Parks'</B> business plan covers the five-year period 1996-2001. During that time:
revenues are expected to increase to $20 million from $15 million; and
cost recovery on operating and capital expenditures is expected to improve to 70 per cent from 45 per cent over the five-year period.<P> <BR>

<B>Ontario Parks Today</B>
<UL>
<LI>Today, Ontario's 265 provincial parks cover 6.2 million hectares. On average, parks receive some 8.5 million visits every year, with 20 per cent coming from outside of Ontario. <P>

<LI>Services offered in provincial parks include camping, picnic areas, visitor centres, museums, beaches, and trails for hiking, biking, skiing and snowmobiling.  In addition, popular programs include outdoor education, resource management and research.<P>

<LI>All parks are open to the public and offer a variety of day-use and camping facilities.  Of the 265 provincial parks, 105 are classified as "operating" and 160 as "non-operating".  Only operating parks have staff on site. However, facilities in non-operating parks are maintained, and the public is welcome to walk into the parks and enjoy most traditional activities.<P>

<LI>Fifteen of the current 105 operating parks are scheduled to become non-operating parks, unless suitable partners can be found or other cost-saving measures are implemented. This will achieve a saving of $515,000. The parks are Batchawana Bay, John E. Pearce, Lake on the Mountain, Lake Nipigon, Mark S. Burnham, Middle Falls, Missinaibi, Obatanga, Pakwash, Peche Island, Peter's Wood, Port Bruce, Potholes, The Shoals and Tidewater.<P>

<LI>In addition, 12 parks may be operated with partners.  This could provide a saving of $834,000.  The parks are: Caliper Lake, Driftwood, Fushimi Lake, Greenwater, Inverhuron, Kap-kig-iwan, Lake of the Woods, Marten River, Mississagi, Ojibway, Ouimet Canyon and Windy Lake.<P>

<LI>As part of the continuing process to bring greater efficiency and effectiveness to government program delivery, Ontario Parks will offer new opportunities for service contracts within provincial parks in 1996.  This will save the parks system approximately $1 million.<P>

<LI>Services that may be contracted include: road and ground maintenance, garbage disposal, janitorial services and snow removal.  Service contracts will be established through a public tender process.<P>

<B>Legacy 2000 - A Partnership to Secure Natural Areas in Ontario
</B>

</CENTER><P>
The Ontario government and The Nature Conservancy of Canada today announced Ontario Parks Legacy 2000 -- a new and innovative partnership using public and private funds to help complete a  system of parks and other protected areas in Ontario by the end of  this century.<P>
         
"With this partnership, the government is able to move forward to secure significant natural areas for the protection and enjoyment of future generations," said Natural Resources Minister Chris Hodgson. "This land acquisition will also assist us in research and education efforts to develop a better understanding of Ontario's natural environment," Mr. Hodgson added. <P>    
         
"Our organization has a long history of working with both private and public sector partners to preserve some of the best remaining examples of Ontario's diverse natural heritage," said John Eisenhauer, Executive Director of The Nature Conservancy of Canada. "Through the Ontario Parks Legacy 2000 program, and with a higher level of support from private sources, the Nature Conservancy looks forward to securing new park lands for the benefit of wildlife and as a continuing legacy for the people of Ontario," Mr. Eisenhauer added.<P> 
                
The Nature Conservancy of Canada is a national organization  dedicated to securing and protecting significant natural areas in Canada, and has worked in partnership with MNR over the years.<P>
         
The Ontario Parks Legacy 2000 agreement is based on a four-year plan, under which the Nature Conservancy of Canada will conduct a campaign to raise funds for the acquisition of new parkland worth at least $4 million before April 1, 2000.<P>
         
Annual reports prepared by the Nature Conservancy will provide updates on the funds raised and details on important land acquisitions.

<B>1996 Moose Hunting Season
</B>
</CENTER><P>

Hunters are reminded that applications for the adult moose hunt validation tag draw must be received no later than 4:30 p.m., May 15, 1996, and that a valid Outdoors Card is required to enter the tag draw.<P>

The number of tags in some Wildlife Management Units has been reduced this year.  However, some WMUs are in a position to offer more tags than last year.<P>

The largest reduction in the number of tags issued has taken place in WMU 35, in an area north of Sault Ste. Marie District.  This is because of a decline in the moose population coupled with a greater than planned harvest of bull moose in 1995.  For similar reasons other WMUs, including 13, 15B and 21A in Thunder Bay District, have seen a smaller number of tags issued than WMU 35.<P>

Areas where an increase has occurred this year include WMU 42, in North Bay District, where the number of tags is up to 105 in 1996 from 65 in 1995, and WMU 47, in Parry Sound District, where the number of tags jumped to 340 from 230.<P>

For more information, hunters can obtain a copy of the 1996 Moose Hunter's Fact Sheet at all licence issuers and local MNR offices.<P>

Outdoors Card holders are required to submit renewals at least three weeks before the May 15 adult moose validation tag draw deadline to avoid delays and help ensure they receive a new card in time to participate in the draw.  Cards can be renewed by mail or by calling the automated Outdoors Card renewal hot line, at  1-800-288-1155.  The fastest method is to renew by phone.<P>

<B>Hiawatha First Nation To Govern Serpent Mounds Park</B>
</CENTER><P>
The Chief of the Hiawatha First Nation and the Ontario Minister of Natural Resources have stated that effective April 1, 1996, the Government of Ontario will no longer lease Serpent Mounds Park.<P>

"Given the current value of the Serpent Mounds property, the province can no longer afford to continue to operate the park and provide fair compensation to the First Nation for use of the land," said Natural Resources Minister Chris Hodgson.<P>

"My ministry is turning over all the park's fixed assets to the Hiawatha First Nation, and should the First Nation be in a position to operate the park, our staff will assist, where possible, in setting up the park operation to create an economic development opportunity for the community," added Mr. Hodgson.<P>

The parties agree that the park offers an excellent economic opportunity for the First Nation and surrounding communities.<P>

"Should financing be forthcoming, Hiawatha is looking forward to operating the park, keeping it open to visitors and protecting the area as a natural site which has cultural, historical and spiritual significance to Native peoples throughout North America," said Hiawatha First Nation Chief Frank Cowie. <P>

Serpent Mounds Park is located south of Highway 7 near Rice Lake and the village of Keene.  Owned by the Hiawatha First Nation, the site has been leased by the province for the past 41 years to operate as a provincial park.<P>

The park is named for ancient Aboriginal burial mounds found in the area.  The Serpent Mounds site is unique in Canada.  Nine burial mounds located in the park enclose the remains of Aboriginal people who gathered on the shores of Rice Lake more than 2,000 years ago.  Six of the mounds combine to form the shape of a serpent.<P>

<B>Ontario's Provincial Parks Start Reservations May 1</B>
</CENTER><P>
Ontario's provincial parks system is standardizing its 1996 campsite reservation service, meaning most park reservations will begin being accepted May 1.<P>   
                              
There are only four exceptions to this policy:  Algonquin, Point Farms and Sauble Falls, where reservation services open April 1, and Quetico which accepts reservations starting February 1 as part of backcountry travel packages.<P>
               
In the past, a few other provincial parks have also offered early reservation services.  Campers who have previously booked campsites at these parks by telephone, mail, or in-person will now be able to do so, beginning May 1.<P>
               
"This measure will reduce our operating costs," said Natural Resources Minister Chris Hodgson. "We have tried to choose cost-saving measures that have the least impact on our park customers.  We will have more than two months in which to process reservations before the busy July-August camping period," Mr. Hodgson added.<P>
               
"We will be working hard to accept customers' requests starting May 1," said Ontario Parks Managing Director, Norm Richards.  "This year, another eight parks will implement the new computerized reservation/registration system, which will allow us to process applications faster.  Now more than 80 per cent of our reservations will be handled through this computer service." <P>
               
For more information about Ontario provincial parks, visitors can call 1-800-668-2746, or within Metro Toronto (416) 314-0944.<P>

<B>Minister Signs Licence for 1996 Family Fishing Weekend</B>
</CENTER><P>

Ontario Natural Resources Minister Chris Hodgson today signed the documents that will enable the 1996 Ontario Family Fishing Weekend to take place across the province in early July.<P>

The documents were signed at the Ontario Out Of Doors 1996 Fishing Show in Toronto.  The Ontario Family Fishing Weekend is designed to encourage participation in recreational fishing, especially by Ontarians who have never or seldom fished.<P>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="fun.gif">
"During the weekend of July 5 to 7, the people of Ontario and other Canadians will have a unique opportunity to enjoy recreational fishing without having to buy a licence," Mr. Hodgson said.  "The Family Fishing Weekend is becoming a tradition in Ontario. It gives people who only thought about fishing an opportunity to try it and to learn about conservation and rehabilitation of Ontario's fishing resources."<P>

The weekend is made possible through the work of a steering committee comprising of representatives from the Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR), the Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters, the Association of Conservation Authorities of Ontario, the Canadian National Sportsfishing Foundation, Resorts Ontario, and representatives from the tourism and tackle industries.<P>

"The Family Fishing Weekend is a fine example of partnership at work," said Mr. Hodgson.  "All partners on the steering committee contribute expertise and significant resources to make this a perfect weekend for all Ontarians to enjoy fishing."<P>

This is the third consecutive year that MNR and its partners are offering the licence-free fishing weekend.  Studies done last year show that in addition to providing excellent recreational and educational opportunities, the event brought more people out to fish.  This should stimulate the fishing and tourism industries across the province in the long run.<P>

The Fishing Show, where today's signing ceremony took place, is being held until February 18 at the International Centre in Mississauga.  It is an annual event with promotional activities and displays that attracts some 40,000 anglers.<P>

<B>Government Re-introduces Managed Forest Tax Rebate
</B>
</CENTER><P>

Natural Resources Minister Chris Hodgson today announced the re-introduction of the Managed Forest Tax Rebate Program (MFTRP) to promote sound environmental practices in the management of private woodlands.<P>

"The program will ensure that owners of private forest lands are in a better position to manage their woodlots for the long-term health of the environment," Mr. Hodgson said.<P>

The MFTRP -- which is being re-introduced as an interim measure until the property tax system is reformed -- is designed to promote better management of private woodlands, contribute to the overall health of Ontario's forest ecosystems, and create rural economic development opportunities.  It was first introduced in 1973 but was cancelled in 1993 by the previous NDP government which had other spending priorities.<P>

To control expenditures, the new program has an expenditure ceiling of $4 million.<P>

"The Managed Forest Tax Rebate will nicely complement MNR's Private Land Resources Stewardship Program and sustainability fund," said Mr. Hodgson.  "Together, they will effectively encourage and support owners to invest in the management of their forests based on environmentally sound practices."<P>

The Ministry will work with the Ontario Forestry Association (OFA) and the Ontario Woodlot and Sawmill Operators' Association (OWSOA) to conduct information sessions for private woodlot owners across Ontario.<P>

"We are pleased to be working with the Ministry on this important initiative which will benefit both woodlot owners and the environment," said Rick Monzon, OFA's Executive Director.<P>

"This program will ensure that communities continue to reap the benefits of well-managed private forest lands," said Harry Barr, President of OWSOA.<P>

"Snowmobile clubs depend on the goodwill of private landowners who permit organized recreational trails to cross their property.  The MFTRP was very helpful in promoting a broader view of the importance of recreational access to private woodlots and the OFSC has strongly advocated its 
re-establishment," said Ron Purchase, General Manager of the Ontario Federation of Snowmobile Clubs.<P>

Mr. Hodgson also announced that MNR's Private Forest Sustainability Fund will be reduced to $1 million from $2 million as a further cost-control measure.  The fund was established in 1994 to support MNR's community-based programs that encourage good management of private forests.<P>

Information sessions will be conducted in various locations across Ontario during March and April, 1996.<P>

<B>Hodgson Announces Emergency Deer Feeding
</B>
</CENTER><P>

Natural Resources Minister Chris Hodgson today announced that MNR staff in
Sault Ste. Marie, North Bay, Parry Sound, Bracebridge and Bancroft have declared an emergency status for deer because of the severity of this winter's weather.<P>

"We have set up an emergency feeding program," Mr. Hodgson said.  "Without these measures, conditions for deer could be critical by late March.  MNR staff are monitoring the status of deer herds in other areas."<P>

Repeated snowfalls and unusually cold temperatures this winter have depleted the animals' fat reserves, which could result in high losses without emergency feeding.<P>

To deal with this situation, MNR has set up a feeding program with the assistance of several major partners, including the St. Joseph Hunters and Anglers Association, the Loring-Restoule Deer Feeding Fund, the Wildlife Winter Feeding Fund Inc. administered by Jack Newton of Huntsville, and the DeerSave Fund of the Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters in Peterborough.<P>

While the mid-January thaw helped briefly to make the situation less critical, recent snowfalls have again restricted deer movements.  Deer started moving into their winter yards in late November - a month earlier than normal - where they fed on vegetation that they would have required later in the winter.<P>

"Many clubs, groups and individuals have contributed time, money and effort breaking trails, providing feed and donating money, Mr. Hodgson said.  "Their help is greatly appreciated and will continue to be needed to help reduce stress on deer wintering in these key locations."<P>

Individuals and groups can help by donating funds to a group directly involved with this program, or by contacting the local MNR office.<P>

<B>Now Illegal To Buy Or Sell Angler-Caught Fish
</B>
</CENTER><P>
Under an amendment to the Game and Fish Act, anglers, who fish anywhere in Ontario, are prohibited from selling their catches of fish. It is also illegal for anyone to purchase fish caught by anglers.<P> 

The amendment to Section 72, which took effect January 1, 1996, states: "Except under the authority of a licence and in accordance with the regulations, no person shall sell, offer for sale, purchase, barter, culture or be concerned in the sale, purchase, barter or culture of fish other than species designated in the regulation."<P>

Yellow perch angled from the waters of Lake St. Francis in eastern Ontario may continue to be sold, but only within the United Counties of Stormont, Dundas and Glengarry.<P>

The sale of angler-caught fish has long been an issue within Ontario's angling community. With this new regulation, angling will focus on the recreational values of fishing and no longer involve commercialization of the fish caught.<P>

<B> Ministry of Natural Resources Releases <BR>
Report on Prescribed Burn Program
</B>
</CENTER><P>
The Ministry of Natural Resources today released the results of the
review of its prescribed burn program.<P>

The report says prescribed burning is an effective and efficient
resource management tool, but recognizes that there is always an
element of risk when utilizing fire within the forest.<P>

Natural Resources Minister Chris Hodgson established the review in
August as a result of prescribed fires in MNR's Wawa and Hearst
districts that escaped their boundaries.  The minister also ordered a
ban on the prescribed burn program at that time.<P>

In the new year, the minister will announce his plans for prescribed
burns in Ontario and launch an action plan to address some of the
report's recommendations.<P>

"I am impressed with the report.  I want to thank the members of the
review team for their extensive analysis of our prescribed burning
program," said Mr. Hodgson.<P>

"Our goal now is to implement and develop ways to continue to
minimize the risk to the public and to refine the use of prescribed
burns in sustainable forestry," Mr. Hodgson said.<P>

Members of the review team included representatives from the Office
of the Fire Marshal, forest industry, Canadian Forest Service, the
Township of Dubreuilville, and MNR. (Please see attached list)<P>

The complete report, which lists 17 specific recommendations
involving nine areas of focus, is available from the Natural
Resources Information Centres, in Toronto and Peterborough; through
MNR district offices in Wawa and Hearst; and through the Provincial
Fire Response Centre in Sault Ste. Marie.<P>

<B>MNR Awarded Two-Year Coyote & Fox Rabies Contract in Texas
</B>
</CENTER><P>
The Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources has been awarded a two-year contract to drop 2.5 million baits over more than 100,000 square kilometres to help in the fight against coyote and fox rabies in Texas.  Texas will pay all MNR expenses including salaries.<P>

"I am very pleased that MNR has been awarded this contract," said Natural Resources Minister Chris Hodgson.  "This is further proof of Ontario's worldwide reputation for excellence in rabies research and technology."<P>

The contract begins January 2, 1996.  Last February two MNR Twin Otter aircraft were used in the experimental fight against coyote rabies in the state.  An estimated 800,000 rabies baits were dropped over an area of more than 31,000 square kilometres in less than two weeks.<P>

The plan this year is to expand the coyote rabies bait drop zone to include the area baited last February, and to drop grey fox rabies bait in another part of the state.<P>

During the experimental drop last February, MNR air service staff flew and maintained the two aircraft, while MNR rabies research staff trained their Texas counterparts in the use of the Ontario-designed bait dropping equipment.  The Ontario team included a Queen's University computer specialist who provided navigational data to ensure precise coverage of the target areas.<P>

This year's expanded MNR mission to Texas includes crews for three Twin Otters, five rabies research staff, and the Queen's University computer specialist.  They will work every day for one month to complete the project.<P>

Ontario is well on the way to eliminating fox rabies in the province.  The fox rabies control project, started in 1989, is expected to eliminate the disease in Ontario by the year 2001.<P>

This fall MNR dropped 1.8 million fox rabies vaccine baits in southern Ontario.  In addition, the ministry provided aircraft, baiting machines and staff for similar, smaller-scale, bait-dropping projects in areas of New York State and Quebec which border Ontario.<P>

<B>Motel Strip Redevelopment Clears Hurdle
</B>
</CENTER><P>
The Ontario government has cleared the way for the Metropolitan Toronto and Region Conservation Authority to expropriate five properties along Etobicoke's motel strip.  The expropriation is a major component of the redevelopment project that will create a waterfront park.<P>

"This redevelopment plan was 25 years in the making," Mr. Hodgson said.  "It represents a unique blend of private and public interests, and it is good for Etobicoke and Metro.<P>

"This will create jobs and stimulate the economy," Mr. Hodgson said.<P>

The motel strip redevelopment plan includes private commercial and residential development, along with development by the conservation authority of a new waterfront park and roadway.<P>

"The park will link the Etobicoke Humber Bay parks to the western beaches in Toronto," said Mr. Hodgson. "It is also an important part of the stormwater management system that is necessary if the rest of the development in the area is to go ahead".<P>

The properties being expropriated will form part of the park.  The conservation authority has already negotiated agreements with other landowners, developers and public agencies for the rest of the land it needs.<P>

<B>MNR Adopts Local Recommendations <BR>For New Trout Fishing Regulations
</B>
</CENTER><P>
After two years of public consultation, the Ministry of Natural Resources today announced important changes to trout fishing regulations in South-Central Ontario.  The most recent round of public consultation occurred earlier this fall when Minister Chris Hodgson called on five local advisory committees to make recommendations on how to rehabilitate declining trout populations.  The changes take effect on January 1, 1996 and affect close to 200 lakes in the Bracebridge, Minden/Haliburton, Bancroft, Mazinaw and Pembroke areas.<P>

Most of the regulatory changes apply to lakes with naturally reproducing brook trout and lake trout.<P>

"Trout have been in decline in some parts of South-Central Ontario for many years," said Mr. Hodgson.  "In addition to development and pollution from faulty septic systems, overharvest has played a significant role in the decline."<P>

Under the new regulations, some trout lakes will be closed for fishing during the winter and early spring, and others will be subject to slot size limits plus a one-line restriction.  Slot size limits are a kind of catch-and-release fishing procedure that require anglers to release fish of reproductive size.  Fish larger and smaller than the "slot" may be kept.<P>

"Ice fishing in this part of Ontario is a time-honoured pastime and an integral component of the rural Ontario winter tourism economy", said Mr. Hodgson.  "We simply can't afford to lose this precious resource, so we must take steps now to ensure that it will be there for generations to come".<P>

The Ministry of Natural Resources will continue working with the local advisory committees for years to come.  "I want to congratulate and thank the members of the five committees for the hard work they've done to date", said the Minister.  "It has only just begun though.  The process of finding local solutions to local problems must continue.<P>

"I'm calling on individual anglers and the fish and game clubs of Ontario to help in this move to rebuild fish stocks," said Mr. Hodgson.  "Proper angling and live-release techniques are key to rebuilding trout populations and I am confident that anglers will play their part to preserve lake trout and brook trout."<P>

The Minister also announced new regulations to provide greater fishing opportunities in some other lakes.  "In divisions 7, 15, and 29, rainbow trout and splake seasons will now be open year round," he said.<P>

The ministry is advising anglers to familiarize themselves with the new regulations before the trout season opens on January 1.  Anglers should contact their local MNR office for details about specific lakes and to inquire about alternate angling opportunities in their area.<P>

<B>MNR Signs New Partnership Agreement<BR>
With Trent University and Sir Sandford Fleming College</B>
</CENTER><P>
<IMG SRC="logos.gif"><P>
PETERBOROUGH -- The Ministry of Natural Resources, Trent University and Sir Sandford Fleming College today signed a new Partnership Agreement, focusing on the goals and mandates common to the three organizations, particulary in the areas of natural resources, environment, ecosystems management and related operations.<P> 

"Partnerships are key to achieving the ministry's primary goal of sustainable development of natural resources," said Natural Resources Minister Chris Hodgson.  "This partnership with Trent and Sir Sandford Fleming has been a priority for the ministry.  It is an excellent example of the spirit of cooperation the government wants to foster in building relationships with private and public agencies," Mr. Hodgson added.<P>

"Partnerships with the public and private sectors are an important priority for Trent as a means of strengthening our research and teaching capabilities," said Trent University President Leonard Conolly.  "Given Trent's recognized expertise in environmental studies, this new partnership makes perfect sense for the university and brings tangible benefits to all three organizations," Dr. Conolly added.<P> 

"This agreement provides an opportunity for Sir Sandford Fleming College to expand and enrich these relationships in ways which will better serve its students, the community and the citizens of Ontario," said Sir Sandford Fleming President Dr. Brian Desbiens.<P>

The Partnership Agreement is a statement of intent by the organizations to undertake ongoing discussion, maintain working committees, identify potential efficiencies and explore partnership opportunities in five broad categories:  strategic business development, community development/social integration, training/education, sharing resources and information, and co-operative research.<P> 

Initially, the agreement will be for five years, and may be renewed for another five years.<P>

<B>MNR Denies Permit to Dredge Lake Bed
</B><P>
In the interest of public safety, Natural Resources Minister Chris Hodgson has denied Bedrock Resources Inc. a permit to extract sand from the bottom of Lake Ontario along Toronto's eastern beaches.<P>

"Based on available evidence, the project may pose a risk to public health and to the environment," Mr. Hodgson said.  "In addition, information brought recently to our attention raises uncertainty concerning potential impacts on the environment."<P>

A Toronto Board of Health report states that the project could cause contaminants to be released into surrounding waters.  This could have adverse effects on drinking water quality, sewer outfall operations, general lakeshore water quality, and fish and other aquatic habitat.<P>

"Field data and model studies show that the effects of the disturbance of lake bed sediments by underwater dredging are largely unpredictable," Mr. Hodgson said.<P>

Under the <I>Aggregate Resources Act</I>, the Minister can refuse to issue an aggregate permit if he considers that the resulting operations would be contrary to public interest.<P>

<B>Prescribed Burn Studies Continue </B><P>
Natural Resources Minister Chris Hodgson today announced that a 10-member panel will study ways to improve Ontario's prescribed burn program and better protect public safety and private property.<P>
The panel will focus on a thorough review of four prescribed burns that escaped their boundaries in the Wawa and Hearst districts in August and propose measures to improve current provincial practices.  Mr. Hodgson's announcement follows his recently receiving a preliminary report on the prescribed burns.<P>
"We will move to try to prevent a situation such as the Dubreuilville fire from ever happening again," Mr. Hodgson said.<P>
Bob French, a field service manager with the Office of the Fire Marshal, and Al Stewart, regional director of MNR's Central Region, co-chair the program review panel.  Other members include representatives from the forest industry, the municipality of Dubreuilville, the Canadian Forest Service and a cross-section of MNR staff.<P>
Mr. Hodgson launched the initial review of the program on August 22, following the escape of the prescribed burns in northeastern Ontario that were ignited by MNR crews on August 2.<P>
The two Wawa district burns, fanned by extreme winds, turned into wildfires by August 20, forcing a week-long evacuation of some 1,000 residents of Dubreuilville.<P>
The preliminary report contains a brief summary of the ministry's prescribed burn program, a chronological account of the Wawa and Hearst prescribed burns, cost estimates, and an overview of this summer's fire and drought conditions.<P>
"I expect to receive the final report by November 30, 1995," Mr. Hodgson said.  "The ban on prescribed burns that I had ordered in August remains in effect, but I am lifting the ban on slash pile burning."<P>
<I>The Preliminary report and fact sheets on the prescribed burns program are available at the Natural Resources Information Centre,

<B>MNR Participates in New York State<BR> 
Aerial Bait Drop for Raccoon Rabies</B><P>
The Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources will participate this weekend in an aerial bait drop in New York State, designed to test an oral rabies vaccine to slow or stop raccoon rabies.<P>
MNR scientists will team up with research veterinarians and wildlife biologists from Cornell University's College of Veterinary Medicine for the project which begins on October 14 and runs to October 16, weather permitting.<P>
Two different baits -- one produced in Ontario, the other in the United States and both containing a U.S. approved oral rabies vaccine, will be distributed in two areas of New York State -- Niagara County, and portions of Jefferson, Lewis and St. Lawrence counties near the St. Lawrence River.<P>
The New York trials objectives are to establish a barrier of vaccinated raccoons to stop the advance of the raccoon rabies front along the St. Lawrence, and to try and stop an already existing outbreak of raccoon rabies in Niagara County, New York.<P>
The New York project will test both vaccine-baits to see if the raccoons eat the baits and also which one they prefer.<P>
The two baits, will be distributed at a rate of one per three acres. The cream- coloured Ontario-made baits have a distinctive smell and are made of beef tallow, wax, icing sugar and marshmallow essence. The American-made polymer bait consists of fish meal, a binder and fish oil and is brown in colour.<P>
Ontario stands to benefit from the New York State project because it contributes to provincial efforts to prevent the spread of raccoon rabies into Ontario. It will also provide new information on which bait, at what density, we should use if raccoon rabies does get into Ontario.<P>
Along with on-site technical advice, MNR is providing two Twin Otters, specially equipped with baiting machines and computerized flight line navigation system for the aerial drops.<P>

<hr>
<p>We are a pioneer and acknowledged leader in applying advanced mathematics, statistics and Computational Intelligence (C.I.) 
to market analysis and money management. </p>
<p>Computational Intelligence is one of the <i>fastest growing areas of market research on Wall Street Today.</i> It is computer 
intervention or assistance in tasks requiring human reasoning, intelligence, intuition and imagination. Using knowledge based 
<a href="./technolo/es.htm"><b>&quot;expert&quot; systems </b></a>, <a href="./technolo/nn.htm"><b>neural networks </b></a>and <a href="./technolo/ga.htm"><b>genetic algorithms </b></a>, this technology is capable of resolving problems of 
uncertain outcome that normally require human judgment and experience. </p>
<p>Properly programmed, the results of such problem solving efforts are accurate within a very narrow range of tolerance or 
confidence. Looking at today's market place, with its thousands of inter-relationships and increasing number of variables that 
continue to grow exponentially, C.I. is revolutionizing the way we approach market analysis. </p>
<p>A C.I. system can do mechanically what a team of skilled market analysts would do. What makes it better, is that it <i>can 
analyze more data faster and more reliably than a human can</i> and do it without bias or emotion. The most crucial 
investment decisions are made at market turning points. That is where human emotion gets in the way of judgment. The 
computer eliminates that problem. </p>
<p>C.I. systems offer distinct advantages over traditional methods of analysis. They have the ability to efficiently process 
thousands of pieces of data and consider millions of possible combinations to discover relevant relationships that may not 
otherwise be apparent. Such analysis is extremely rapid, unemotional, and unaffected by personal bias. These systems are 
dynamic and self adapting. Unlike conventional market analysis that relies on static approaches, these new methods are able to 
adjust to changing market conditions and downplay or eliminate factors that are no longer relevant. </p>
<p>The LBS System provides a dynamic, <i>self adapting decision mechanism that is intelligently sensitive to changing market 
conditions.</i> The process is disciplined, completely objective and highly risk-averse. </p>
<p>As a leading provider of advanced technology-based investment management services worldwide, LBS is driven by client 
needs and a pursuit of excellence in developing solutions for those needs. </p>

<h1><img src="../pics/computer.gif" align=bottom border=2 width=100 height=80> Investment Programs **</h1>
<p>&#160; </p>
<h2>MANAGED EQUITY PORTFOLIOS (MEP)</h2>
<p>LBS offers three unique individually managed portfolios - Large Cap, MidCap and Core equity. These programs employ two 
branches of Computational Intelligence: neural networks and genetic algorithms. The MEP program allows the individual 
investor to participate in the same strategies employed by some of the country&#146;s largest institutional investors.<br>
</p>
<h2 align=left>ASSET ALLOCATION</h2>
<p align=left><strong>Focused Sector Opportunities</strong><br>
An aggressively managed mutual fund program that rotates client assets among Fidelity Select Funds, using LBS technology to 
periodically shift assets to the three sectors (of 35) deemed to have the greatest performance potential for the intermediate 
term.</p>
<p align=left><strong>SMAART...a first of its kind global asset allocation program</strong><br>
This program manages risk by diversifying assets globally among 6-8 stock and bond funds selected from 10 asset classes. 
Each fund is pre-screened for excellence. Accounts are dynamically rebalanced and re-weighted as market conditions dictate. 
With the simplicity of a single account, SMAART provides clients with an investment in multiple mutual funds and a strategy 
designed to reduce investment risk.<br>
</p>
<h2 align=left>INVESTMENT RISK MANAGEMENT</h2>
<p align=left><strong>Individual Mutual Fund and Variable Annuities</strong> <br>
LBS manages investment risk for over 300 mutual funds and variable annuities covering a broad spectrum of global equity and 
fixed income asset classes. OMNI, LBS&#146; proprietary risk management model, is designed to keep accounts invested in rising 
markets and shift them to the safety of money markets when the systems anticipate a period of high risk.</p>
<p align=left><strong>MAXIMIZER - an LBS exclusive</strong><br>
In this program, LBS selects the funds, using technology to identify and invest accounts in three to four equity funds from a 
pre-screened universe of domestic or international funds. When OMNI anticipates a period of high risk, accounts are 
transferred to the safety of money markets; when a buy signal is registered, the universe is re-analyzed and accounts <br>
are reinvested in funds exhibiting the greatest relative strength and momentum at that time. With the convenience of a single 
account, this program is designed to rotate clients&#146; investments among top performing domestic or international funds. This 
strategy seeks maximum returns while controlling market risk.</p>
<p align=left><strong>Global Advantage</strong><br>
The Global Advantage program is designed to combine, in a single account, LBS&#146;<u> Investment Risk Management</u> signals with 
an asset allocation approach. The driving force behind the program is the inverse correlation demonstrated by U.S. and foreign 
equity markets. Based on our intermediate market forecasts, the program shifts assets among domestic equities, international 
equities, and money markets.</p>

<h2 align=center>January 1997 Quarterly Update - Our View of the Market </h2>
<hr>
<p><b>Portfolio Manager's Corner - Risk Management Individual Funds and Variable Annuities</b></p>
<p><b>Domestic Equities - </b>OMNI has proven to be on target with the re-entry signal generated August 2nd. The Lipper Mid Cap 
Index has surged ahead 9.21% as of December 31st, with the Lipper Growth and Income Fund charging ahead 12.55%. As 
in 1995, the Energy, Banking, and Semiconductor sectors have led the way, benefiting from their ability to impose their pricing 
power on the consumer.</p>
<p>As we moved into the fourth quarter, LBS' proprietary systems were indicating the market was poised to move 5-7% higher. 
Interest rates were on the decline, and the overall sentiment of the market was constructive. Ours was cautious optimism, 
however, as earnings season was once again upon us.</p>
<p>The Dow broke through the 6,000 barrier for the first time on October 14th, as earnings ranged from in-line to better than 
expected. The overriding concern for the market remained the tenuous control over Congress held by the Republican party. 
This concern led to increased jockeying by portfolio managers, and the market held in a tight trading range through the 
election.</p>
<p>The election results brought relief to the financial markets, as Republicans were able to maintain control of the Congress. This 
resulted in a drastic increase in trading activity, as well as a tremendous volatility breakout to the upside. Heavy short covering 
fueled the breakout, and the equity market played catch-up with the bond market. Investors were looking for liquidity, and 
large capitalization stocks were the recipient of heavy inflows. A gap began to develop between the S&amp;P 500 index and the 
Frank Russell 2000, a broader-based index. This divergence is typical of a market which may be on the last legs of a rally. 
However, the market continued to exhibit upward momentum.</p>
<p>Alan Greenspan wrecked havoc on the psyche of the market in early December, as he wondered aloud how we would know 
when investors were exhibiting &quot;irrational exuberance&quot;. Perhaps when all regard to inherent market risk is discounted? Despite 
Mr. Greenspan's musings on the rationality of the markets, the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee elected to leave 
interest rates unchanged. This news was digested well by the exchanges, and we continued to probe the upper resistance 
levels.</p>
<p>As we head into the New Year, we remain cautiously optimistic. The market has formed a &quot;double-top&quot;, and interest rates 
have begun to rise. In general, the equity markets have moved inversely to interest rates. Caution, vigilance, and a disciplined 
approach will be the keys to navigating a potentially volatile 1997.</p>
<p><b>International Equities - </b>LBS remained headed into the fourth quarter fully invested in both international equity categories. 
Many international indices were at all-time highs heading into the quarter, with several European bourses exhibiting particular 
strength. The Eurotop 100 index (similar to the S&amp;P 500) advanced 20% in 1996, benefiting from slow growth and strong 
bond markets. The bond market was fueled by nations running budget deficit reduction programs to comply with the 
standards set for the pending European Monetary Union. London's FTSE 100 Index returned 22.1% in dollar terms.</p>
<p>Asia did not fully participate in the international rally. In fact, Japan was down 16.2% in dollar terms, and has sustained 
several 2%+ daily losses. LBS exited the Asia Pacific category on December 19th, and as we go to press the Nikkei Index 
has broken down through the 19,000 support level.</p>
<p><b>Utilities, Gov't Bonds, Muni Bonds, Int'l Bonds</b> - We entered the fourth quarter fully invested in all bond categories. The 
yield on the 30 year long bond tumbled as traders began to discount any possibility of the Fed hiking interest rates. A slowing 
economy, as evidenced by the 2.1% annual increase in 3rd quarter GDP (this versus the 4.8% seen in the second quarter) 
and rising unemployment figures were the impetus for the declining yield. Labor costs have not increased as rapidly as in the 
past, which helped keep inflation moderate.</p>
<p>Utilities, which normally presage activity in the bond market, staged a nice rally in late October. The bond market, however, 
was focused on the pending election. The Republicans were able to hold their majority in Congress, and the bond market 
celebrated, driving the yield on the long bond down to 6.46%, a thirty basis point drop from the first day of the quarter.</p>
<p>December saw a marked increase in the volatility of the bond market. December 11th brought rumors from London of waning 
Japanese demand for our bonds (the Japanese are by far the biggest foreign owners of our debt securities). LBS exited all 
interest related categories on the heels of this news, with the exception of high yield bonds, which continue to show incredible 
resiliency. We move into the new year with bonds at a critical juncture. We remain on the sidelines, with a readiness to 
re-enter these categories should fourth quarter economic growth be softer than anticipated.</p>
<p><b>Gold - </b>LBS entered the fourth quarter as we had the third, in the safety of money markets. This market was suffering from a 
marked malaise, and was having trouble finding any legs. Given the deterioration earlier in the year (most of which LBS had 
sidestepped), our system was looking for any signs of strength. Again, the pending election seemed to affect this highly volatile 
and illiquid market. </p>
<p>Just after the election, the gold market seemed to bottom. LBS re-entered the gold market on November 13th. This entry was 
met with a quick uptick in prices, but the market never truly found its legs. European central banks are rumored to be selling 
heavily, regardless of their effect on the market. The seeming lack of inflation was also contributing to the continued troubles of 
this market. We move into the first quarter with a sell signal pending.</p>
<p><b>Int'l Maximizer - </b>This portfolio remains invested in Europe, which has outperformed the Asia Pacific area (see above). </p>
<p><b>Domestic Maximizer</b> - These portfolios have retained their large market capitalization bias, which has served us extremely 
well over the past quarter. Investors have been making the flight to liquidity, and this has bolstered the valued of large cap 
stocks<font size=2>.</font> &#160;</p>

<h1>Genetic Algorithms</h1>
<p>Genetic algorithms are general-purpose search techniques for solving complex problems. Based upon genetic and evolutionary 
principles, GAs work by repeatedly modifying a population of artificial structures through the application of selection, 
crossover, and mutation operators. The choice of an appropriate structure for a particular problem is a major factor 
determining a GAs success. GAs are capable of operating upon a variety of structures, including binary strings (Goldberg, 
1989), computer programs (Koza, 1992), neural networks (Whitley, Starkweather, &amp; Bogart, 1990), and <i>if-then</i> rules 
(Bauer, 1994). GAs have traditionally been used for optimization, but with a few enhancements, can be applied to 
classification and prediction as well. </p>
<p>We first examine how a traditional GA performs optimization. The goal in optimization is to find the best possible solution to a 
problem. In real-world problem solving, one does not usually know the best possible solution. Therefore, a more realistic 
objective is to find a <i>good</i> solution; or, given a current benchmark, to search for a <i>better</i> solution. A GAs <i>fitness function</i> 
measures the quality of a particular solution. </p>
<p>The traditional GA begins with a population of <i>n</i> randomly generated structures, where each structure encodes a solution to the 
task at hand. The GA proceeds for a fixed number of generations. During each generation, the GA improves the structures in 
its current population by performing selection, followed by crossover, followed by mutation. After a number of generations, the 
GA converges, meaning that all structures in the population become identical or nearly identical. The user typically chooses the 
best structure of the last population as the final solution. </p>
<p><i>Selection</i> is the population improvement or &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; operator. Basically, it duplicates structures with higher 
fitnesses and deletes structures with lower fitnesses. A common selection method is to randomly choose two structures from 
the population and hold a tournament, advancing the fitter structure to the crossover stage. A total of <i>n</i> such tournaments are 
held to fill the input population of the crossover stage. </p>
<p><i>Crossover</i>, when combined with selection, results in good components of good structures combining to yield even better 
structures. Crossover forms n/2 pairs from the mutation stage. The offspring are the results of cutting and splicing the parent 
structures at various crossover points. The crossover stage advances a total of n elements to the mutation stage. </p>
<p><i>Mutation</i> creates new structures that are similar to current structures. With a small, prespecified probability, mutation 
randomly alters each component of each structure. The mutation stage advances <i>n</i> elements to the selection stage of the next 
generation, completing the cycle. </p>
<p>Figure 1 illustrates one generation of a GA with a population of size <i>n</i> = 4. Structures are represented as rectangles, each 
containing two square components. Components may take on one of two values, represented by the colors, black and white. 
Assume that structures with two black components have the highest fitness, structures with two white components have the 
lowest fitness, and mixed structures have intermediate fitness. The selection stage holds four tournaments between randomly 
chosen pairs of individuals. The crossover stage then cuts and splices structures at component boundaries. Finally the mutation 
stage, through random choices, mutates only the leftmost component of Structure 9, yielding Structure 13. Although the initial 
population has no optimal structures, after the generation shown, an optimal structure emerges (Structure 14). </p>

<h1>Expert Systems</h1>
<p>Expert systems are computer programs designed to review a set of facts (knowledge base) and apply a set of rules to arrive at 
the same conclusion that a team of experts would make if presented with the same set of facts. There are three primary 
components to an expert system: rules, knowledge base, and inference engine. </p>
<p>An expert system begins by capturing human expertise in the form of IF/THEN rules. For example, the rule &quot;IF the traffic light 
is red THEN step on the brake,&quot; captures one small aspect of driving expertise. Often dozens (or hundreds) of such rules are 
required to arrive at solutions to complicated problems. </p>
<p>The next step in the process involves applying the rules against a set of facts to determine which rules apply. Embedded within 
the expert system is an inference engine which determines when and how to apply the rules. </p>
<p>The unique order in which the rules are applied to a given set of facts allows the expert system to be dynamic. As one might 
expect given the features and capacity of these technologies, the number of potential good solutions to a problem can be vast. 
To further analyze the vast array of good solutions, LBS employs another type of Computational Intelligence known as Genetic 
Algorithms. </p>

<h1>Neural Networks</h1>
<p>Neural networks, also referred to as neural nets, mimic the human brain's most powerful ability, that of pattern recognition. A 
neural net can make a decision or a prediction by drawing on an inventory of patterns previously learned, seeking the one most 
relevant to the current situation. What distinguishes neural nets from &quot;classical&quot; Artificial Intelligence paradigms, such as 
rule-based systems, is that they &quot;learn&quot; by example and modify themselves, rather than having to be programmed with specific 
preconceived rules. </p>
<p>Neural nets use layers of real or &quot;simulated&quot; electronic neurons with various numeric weights. These weights are dynamically 
modifiable in the &quot;training&quot; phase representing the connection strengths between them to &quot;learn&quot; a predictive ability. A trained 
neural net can be described as a matrix of neurons and connection strengths that represent the &quot;solution&quot; to a problem. 
Commercially available neural net shells, as well as those still being researched, use a variety of algorithms to adjust the 
connection strengths between the neurons until convergence is achieved and the system is able to make correct predictions 
with a significant percentage of accuracy. Once the network successfully sets the weights of the connections to produce the 
correct output, the trained net is ready to use as a predictive or diagnostic tool. </p>

Arizona Institute of Reproductive Medicine, LTD, was established to
provide childless couples with a single source for both men and
women to obtain comprehensive evaluation and the latest
technically advanced infertility testing. Since that time we have
witnessed dramatic and continuous advancements in testing and
procedures that bring new hope to those with problems of
infertility, both male and female.<p>

The Institute is equipped with state of the art research
laboratory facilities. Three separate laboratories are
maintained within the mid-town Phoenix facility as follows;<p>

The In-Vitro Fertilization Laboratory cultures eggs and embryos prior to 
embryo transfer. Eggs and embryos are evaluated using highly
specialized microscopes to determine maturity levels. Humidified
incubators are carefully monitored to assure control of temperature
and gas concentration. Highly qualified personnel can perform
micromanipulation to inject sperm into the egg intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI) 
or assist hatching of the fertilized egg (embryo). On-site
cryopreservation and storage units allow us to "bank" a couples
embryos for future use. Our embryo bank also offers donated
embryos for persons who are unable to produce their own eggs.<p>

The Andrology Laboratory's functions include semen analysis, male
and female antibody testing, hamster egg penetration test and
preparation of sperm specimens for artificial insemination and in-
vitro fertilization. Cryopreservation of sperm enables us to store
a patient's sperm as well as maintain a comprehensive donor pool
(Arizona Sperm Bank, est. 1973) for clients unable to produce their
own sperm.<p>

The General Medical Laboratory provides a broad range of testing
including hormonal assays which give the physician prompt and
complete analysis needed for OB/GYN and infertility evaluation.<p>

El Instituto Arizonense de Medicina Reproductiva, Ltd. Fue establecido
para proporcionar a parejas sin hijos, una fuente distinta tanto para 
hombres y mujeres de obtener una completa examinacion  y los ultimos
avances tecnicos en pruebas de infertilidad. Desde entonces, hemos sido
testigos de los dramaticos y continuos progresos en pruebas de infertilidad
tanto para hombres como para mujeres.

<p>El Instituto esta equipado con lo mas avanzado en tecnologia para la 
investigacion de laboratorio, dispone de tres laboratorios separados, que
se encuentran localizados muy cerca del area del centro de Phoenix.</p>

<p>El laboratorio de In-Vitro Fertilizacion, cultiva ovulos y embriones antes
de transferirlos. Ovulos y embriones son evaluados,  usando microscopios
altamente especializados para determinar los niveles de madurez. Incubadoras
de Humedad son monitoreadas cuidadosamente para asegurar el control de
temperatura y concentracion de gas. Personal altamente calificado, puede
llevar a cabo micromanipulacion del esperma dentro del ovulo (Injeccion
intracitoplasmica del esperma) y asistencia en la zona pelucida del ovulo
fertilizado (Embrion). Tambien Cryopreservacion y  unidades de almacenaje
nos permite "Guardar como en un banco" los Embriones de las Parejas para
el uso futuro de ellos. Nuestro Banco de Embriones tambien ofrece Embriones
Donados, para aquellas personas, quienes no pueden producir sus propios
ovulos.</p>

<p>La funcion del Laboratorio de Andrologia incluye, analisis del semen, pruebas
para Anticuerpos en el hombre y en la mujer y preparacion de muestra de
esperma para inseminacion artificial e In-Vitro Fertilizacion. La cryopreservacion
del esperma nos permite almacenar el esperma de los pacientes tanto como
para mantener un completo conjunto de donadores de esperma (Se establecio
este Banco de Donadores Esperma de Arizona, en 1973), para clientes incapaces de producir
su propio esperma.</p>

<p>El Laboratorio General, provee una amplia variedad de pruebas, incluyendo
evaluaciones Hormonales, las cuales le dan al Doctor un pronto y completo
analisis, necesitadas para OB/GYN (Obstetricia/Ginecologia) y evaluacion
para infertilidad.</p>

<HR></center>
<p>Since age 14, when Dr. Tamis' father taught him ovarian transplantation, the younger Tamis has
 been involved with research.  That research background has been a dominant characteristic of his
 approach to medicine, and that philosophy permeates all aspects of this institution.</p>
<p>One can summarize our approach to medicine, especially infertility, with two statements:<p>
<ul><b>Build a better "mouse trap."</b>
<ul>Whether one discusses our innovative C.A.R.E. financial package, our
individualized approach to stimulation protocols, or our various routes of
hormone administration.  We constantly look for ways to improve what we do, thus
staying at the cutting edge of our field.</ul></ul>
<p>
<ul><b>Infertility is "a mystery."</b>
<ul>Thus our approach to treating the patient is one of being the "detective" hired to
look for the clues to your individual problem.  Without searching for those clues,
one will have difficulty correcting infertility.  Some patient present themselves to
us with very obvious problems, but for most, the cause of their infertility is
complicated. requiring innovative management.</ul></ul></p>
<p>
<ul><b>Not all infertility treatment requires high tech procedures</b>
<ul>Long before invitro fertilization was developed for humans (did you know it was
performed successfully in the rabbit in 1930?), Dr. T@s has had a deep
involvement in evaluating and treating infertility problems.  Today, we still believe
that most problems of fertility can be treated by simply looking for the "clues" that
each patient or couple presents.  Thus, careful evaluation of hormone levels, timing
of ovulation in relationship to LH surge, onset of menses post LH surge, etc many
times can be the signal for simple hormonal manipulation without the need for high
tech procedures.  The easiest way to achieve a pregnancy - is the best way!</ul></ul></p>
<p>
<ul><b>Integrin</b>
<ul>At the end of 1994, we began participating with Dr. Lessey at the University of
North Carolina evaluating failure of invitro fertilization with regards to the
presence or absence of integrin within the endometrium.  The data obtained from
our involvement with Dr. Lessey's group has helped us a high success rate with
frozen embryo transfers in natural cycles in 1995.
Along with the above, Dr. Tamis has been actively involved in the fight for women's reproductive
health.  Thus, the Institute's staff cares for all women - single, married, or otherwise - concerned about their reproductive status.</ul></ul></p>

<p><b>SPERM INJECTION FOR SEVERE MALE INFERTILITY</b></p>
<p></p><p></p></center><p>One of the latest, and most exciting advances in treatment of infertility has been in the area of male factor problems.  Low numbers, poor quality, or absence of sperm have limited the ability to help the couple where the main cause of their infertility was the husbands sperm.  In the past, these couples would have had to resort to donor sperm insemination, or adoption.</p>
<p>Today, it is possible to help these patients with the latest technology of <b>Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injectin (ICSI)</b>. In this procedure, one sperm is injected directly into the egg allowing fertilization to occur.  Thus, minute amounts of sperm can be worked with, for one only needs enough sperm to inject the eggs available, i.e., 10 sperm if one has 10 eggs available.  Because of that, the Arizona Institute of Reproductive Medicine can help couples where:</p>
<ul>
<img src= i_mgmt/redbut.gif width=20 heigth=20>  men have had vasectomies (tubes tied)<br>
<img src= i_mgmt/redbut.gif width=20 heigth=20>  men born without a vas (the tube from the testicle to the outside)<br>
<img src= i_mgmt/redbut.gif width=20 heigth=20>  men with failed vas reversals<br>
<img src= i_mgmt/redbut.gif width=20 heigth=20>  men with extremely low counts<br>
<img src= i_mgmt/redbut.gif width=20 heigth=20>  men with Sertoli Cell Only Syndrome<br>
</ul></center>
<p>It is important to understand that there are many ways to perform sperm counts.  Most commercial laboratories do not spend the time needed to locate minute amounts of sperm.  We have several patients that have been told that they did not have sperm, when in truth, we have located sufficient sperm to allow us to achieve pregnancies via <b>Intracytolplasmic Sperm Injection</b>.</p>

<p>The technology of <b>Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI)</b> was introduced by us in Arizona in 1993. <b>Our success rate in 1995 using ICSI shows the 57% of mature eggs captured fertilized normally, resulting in an ongoing pregnancy rate in women less than 40 of 50%</b>.  We have obtained <b>sperm directly from the testicle by either sperm aspiration or testicular biopsy</b> done in the office and successfully fertilized 42% of eggs injected.  Our first set of <b><u>twins</b></u> recently delivered and celebrated Fathers Day with their dad.</p>

<p>If you believe that a male factor fertility problem exists, call our office for further information, or come visit us and see the modern facility that is here to help you.</p></center>

</PRE><center><h2><b>INYECCION DE ESPERMA PARA SEVERA INFERTILIDAD
MASCULINA</b></h2>
<p></p><p></p><img src="i_mgmt/sound.gif"><font color="#F08080"> This page is MIDI Sound Ready!</font color><hr></center>
<p>Uno de los mas recientes y mas fascinantes avances en tratamiento de infertilidad, ha sido en el area de los problemas de factores masculinos.  Bajo conteo, probre calidad del esperma o ausencia de el, ha limitado la habilidad de ayudar a la pareja donde la principal causa de su infertilidad fue el esperma del esposo.  En el pasado esta parejas hubieran recurrido a inseminacion con donador de esperma o a la adopcion.</p>
<p>Hoy en dia, es posible ayudar a esos pacientes con la mas reciente tecnologia de <b>Inyeccion
Intracitoplasmisca del Esperma (ICSI)</b>, en este procedimiento un esperma es directamente inyectado dentro del ovulo, permitiendo que ocurra la fertilizacion.</p>

<p>De esta manera, con una minima cantidad de esperma puede trabajarse, solamente necesitas suficiente esperma para inyectar ovulos disponibles, como por ejemplo: 10 espermas, para 10 ovulos disponibles, debido a esto El Instituto de Arizona de Medicina Reproductiva, puede ayudar a parejas en:</p>
<ul>
<img src= i_mgmt/redbut.gif width=20 heigth=20>   Hombres que han tenido Vasectomia<br>
<img src= i_mgmt/redbut.gif width=20 heigth=20>   Hombres que han nacido sin el conducto (es un tubo que va desde el testiculo hacia afuera)<br>
<img src= i_mgmt/redbut.gif width=20 heigth=20>   Hombres que han fracasado la reversion de la vasectomia</br>
<img src= i_mgmt/redbut.gif width=20 heigth=20>   Hombres con extremadamente bajo conteo de esperma</br>
<img src= i_mgmt/redbut.gif width=20 heigth=20>   Hombres con el Sindrome de Sertoli Cell<br>
</ul>
<p>Es importante entender que hay muchas maneras de hacer un conteo de esperma.  Casi todos los laboratorios comerciales no toman el tiempo necesario para localizar pequenas cantidades de esperma. Tenemos varios pacientes que les han dicho que no tienen esperma, cuando en verdad hemos localizado suficiente esperma para permitirnos concebir en embarazo por medio de la <b>Inyeccion Intracitoplasmica del esperma (ICSI)</b>.</p>

<p>La tecnologia de <b>(ICSI) <b>fue introducida en Arizona por nosotros, en 1993.  Nuestro exito en 1995 usando ICSI se observa que el 57% porciento de ovulos maduros capturados, fertilizaron normalmente, resultando en un porcentaje de embarazos que siguen su curso en 50% porciento, en mujeres menores de 40 anos de edad.  Hemos obtenido esperma directamente del testiculo, ya sea por aspiracion del esperma o biopsia testicular hecha en la oficina, exitosamente fertlizando ovulos inyectados en un 42% porciento.</p>

<p>Nuestro primer par de Gemelos recientemente ha nacido y celebrado el dia del Padre con su papa.</p>

<p>Si usted cree, que existe un problema de fertilidad de factor masculino, llame a nuestra oficina por informacion o venga a visitarnos y ver las instalaciones modernas que estan aqui, para ayudarle.</p>

<p></p><p></p><img src="i_mgmt/sound.gif"><font color="#F08080"> This page is MIDI Sound Ready!</font color><hr>

<p>Desde la edad de 14 anos, cuando el padre del Doctor Tamis, le enseno como tranplantar ovarios en ratones, el joven Tamis ha estado envuelto en el campo de la investigacion.  Este conocimiento en la investigacion ha sido una caracteristica dominante de sus avances en la medicina, y esta filosofia abarca todos los aspectos de esta Institucion.</p>

<p>Uno puedo resumir los puntos principales de nuestros avances in la medicina, especialmente en infertilidad, en estas cuatro declaraciones.</p>

<h2>CONSTRUIR UNA MEJOR  VERSATILIDAD </h2>

<p>De esta manera algunos hablan de nuestro inovador paquete finaciero llamado  C.A.R.E , nuestro interes por individualizar los protocolos de estimulacion, o nuestras variadas rutas en la administracion hormonal. Constantemente buscamos formas de llegar a ser mejores en lo que hacemos, de esta manera estamos a la vanguardia en nuestro campo.</p>

<h2>INFERTILIDAD ES UN  MISTERIO </h2>

<p>Con nuestro interes de tratar a los pacientes como si fueramos unos  detectives ; que han sido contratados para encontrar una pista para su individual problema.  Sin esta busqueda para esas pistas, se tendria dificultad en corregir infertilidad.  Algunos pacientes se presetan con problemas faciles de percibir, pero la gran mayoria de ellos, la causa de su infertilidad es complicada, requiriendo un manejo inovador.</p>

<h2>NO TODO EL TRATAMIENTO DE INFERTILIDAD REQUIERE PROCEDIMIENTOS DE ALTO TECNOLOGIA</h2>

<p>Antes de que In-Virtro Fertilizacion fuera desarrollado para humanos.  Sabia usted que fue exitosamente hecho en conejos en 1930?  El Dr. Tamis ha estado profundamente ligado a la evaluacion y tratamiento de problemas de infertilidad.  Hoy en dia, creemos que la mayoria de los problemas pueden ser tratados solo buscando simplemente las  pistas  que cada paciente o pareja presenta.  De esa manera, evaluacion cuidadosa de niveles de hormonas, tiempo de ovulacion en relacion con prueba positiva de la hormona luteinizante (LH), conteo de dias despues de la hormona luteinizante (LH) al periodo menstrual, muchas veces puede se una senal, para una sencilla manipulacion hormonal si ninguna necesidad de tener procedimientos de alta tecnologia.  La via mas facil de concebir un emarazo - es el mejor camino!</p>

<p>Proteina B3 o Integrin, que se encuentra alrededor del endometrio.  La informacion obtenida de nuestra participacion con el grupo del Dr. Lessey, nos ha ayudado a incrementar nuestro porcentaje de exito, en Transferencia de Embrion Congelado en ciclos de forma natural en 1995.</p>

<p>Junto con todo esto que hemos mencionado aqui arriba, el Dr. Tamis, ha estado activamente envuelto en la lucha por los derechos de la salud reproductiva de la mujer.  Asi como el, el equipo del Instituto les da sus servicios a todo tipo de mujer, ya sea solteras, casadas o caulquier mujer mujer que tenga algun problema reproductivo.</p>

<LI>The S&amp;P 500 Index of large company stocks gained 8.34% during the fourth quarter, translating to a solid 22.96% return for 1996.  The economic environment of steady growth and low inflation, coupled with strong corporate earnings, helped fuel the stock market rally.
<LI>Annual returns were led by the performance of the technology and financial sectors, which gained 42.34% and 31.79%, respectively.  The capital goods and energy groups, both of which returned in excess of 20% during the year, also performed very well.
<LI>Communications services and utilities, with annual returns of -1.88% and 0.73%, respectively, were the poorest performing groups in the Index.

<B><I>Information presented is for the Fund's I Shares. Average annual total returns were 22.26%, 18.93%, 14.60% and 13.33% for the 1, 3, 5 year and since inception (1/31/87) periods, respectively, for the period ended 12/31/96. </I></B></I>

<P><I>
<B><I>These returns include reinvestment of dividends and capital gains. During this period, some of the Fund's fees may have been waived; if these fees were not waived, total return would have been lower. Results represent past performance and do not guarantee future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate, and shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than original cost.</I></B></I>

<P><I>
<B><I>Prior to November 11, 1994, Norwest Bank Minnesota, N.A. managed a collective trust fund with investment objectives and policies substantially the same as those of the Fund. The performance for the Fund includes the performance of the predecessor collective investment fund for periods before it became a mutual fund on November 11, 1994. The collective investment fund performance was adjusted to reflect the Fund's 1994 estimate of its expense ratio for the first year of operations as a mutual fund. The collective investment fund was not registered under the 1940 Act or subject to certain investment restrictions that are imposed by the Act. If the collective investment fund had been registered under the 1940 Act, the collective investment fund historical return may have been adversely affected.  Distributed by Forum Financial Services, Inc.  Mutual Funds are not FDIC OR FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD INSURED AND MAY LOSE VALUE.  NO BANK GUARANTEE.</I></B></I>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Except with respect to Ready Cash
Investment Fund, Shares become entitled to receive dividends on
the next Fund Business Day after acceptance of an order and are
not entitled to receive dividends declared after the day on which
their redemption becomes effective. Ready Cash Investment Fund
Shares become entitled to receive dividends on the day of the
acceptance of an order and are not entitled to receive dividends
declared on or after the day on which their redemption becomes
effective.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Dividends of net investment income
currently are declared and paid at least annually by each Fund
in accordance with the Fund's dividend policy. For Intermediate
U.S. Government Fund, Total Return Bond Fund and Stable Income
Fund, dividends currently are declared and paid monthly and for
Ready Cash Investment Fund are declared daily and paid monthly.
Each Fund's net capital gain, if any, is distributed at least
annually, typically in December.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Shareholders may choose to have
dividends and distributions of a Fund reinvested in shares of
that Fund (the &quot;Reinvestment Option&quot;), to receive dividends
and distributions in cash (the &quot;Cash Option&quot;) or to
direct dividends and distributions to be reinvested in shares
of another fund of the Trust(the &quot;Directed Dividend Option&quot;).
Plan, IRA and KEOGH accounts are automatically assigned the Reinvestment
Option. All dividends and distributions are treated in the same
manner for Federal income tax purposes whether received in cash
or reinvested in shares of a fund.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Under the Reinvestment Option,
all dividends and distributions of a Fund are automatically invested
in additional Shares of that Fund. All dividends and distributions
are reinvested at a Fund's net asset value as of the payment date
of the dividend or distribution. Shareholders are assigned this
option unless one of the other two options is selected. Under
the Cash Option, all dividends and distributions are paid to the
shareholder in cash. Under the Directed Dividend Option, shareholders
of a Fund whose shares in a single account of that Fund total
$10,000 or more may elect to have all dividends and distributions
reinvested in shares of another fund of the Trust, provided that
those shares are eligible for sale in the shareholder's state
of residence. For further information concerning the Directed
Dividend Option, shareholders should contact the Transfer Agent.

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Bold">Taxation of the Funds. </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Each
Fund is treated as a separate corporation for Federal tax purposes
and intends to continue to qualify for each fiscal year as a regulated
investment company under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended. In addition, each Fund intends to distribute all of its
net investment income and capital gain each year. Accordingly,
it is anticipated that the Funds will not be liable for Federal
income or excise taxes on their net investment income and capital
gain.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Bold">International Fund-International
Portfolio. </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">International
Portfolio is not required to pay Federal in-come taxes on its
net investment income and capital gain, as it is treated as a
partnership for Federal tax purposes. All interest, dividends
and gains and losses of International Portfolio are deemed to
have been &quot;passed through&quot; to International Fund in
proportion to its holdings of International Portfolio, regardless
of whether such interest, dividends or gains have been distributed
by International Portfolio or losses have been realized by the
International Portfolio. Investment income received by International
Fund from sources within foreign countries may be subject to foreign
income or other taxes. International Fund intends to elect, if
eligible to do so, to permit its shareholders to take a credit
(or adeduction) for foreign income and other taxes paid by International
Portfolio. Shareholders of Inter-national Fund will be notified
of their share of those taxes and will be required to include
that amount as income. In that event, the shareholder may be entitled
to claim a credit or deduction for those taxes.<BR>

<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Bold">General. </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Dividends
paid by a Fund out of its net investment income (including any
realized net short-term capital gain) are taxable to shareholders
as ordinary income. Distributions by a Fund of realized net long-term
capital gain, if any, are taxable to shareholders as long-term
capital gain, regardless of the length of time the shareholder
may have held shares in the Fund at the time of distribution.
If Fund shares are sold at a loss after being held for 6 months
or less, the loss will be treated as long-term capital loss to
the extent of any long-term capital gain distribution received
on those shares.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">All capital gain distributions
paid by a Fund and all dividends paid by a Fund (except Total
Return Bond Fund and Ready Cash Investment Fund) and received
by a shareholder reduce the net asset value of the shareholder's
shares by the amount of the distribution or dividend. Furthermore,
a dividend or distribution made shortly after the purchase of
shares by a shareholder, although in effect a return of capital
to that particular shareholder, would be taxable to the shareholder
as described above.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">It is expected that a substantial
portion of the dividends to shareholders of each Equity Fund,
except International Fund, and a portion of each Balanced Fund's
dividends to shareholders will qualify for the dividends received
deduction for corporations. The amount of such dividends eligible
for the dividends received deduction is limited to the amount
of dividends from domestic corporations received during a Fund's
fiscal year. To the extent International Fund invests in the securities
of domestic issuers, the dividends to shareholders of the Fund
may qualify for the dividends received deduction for corporations.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">The Funds may be required by Federal
law to withhold 31 percent of reportable payments (which may include
taxable dividends, capital gain distributions and redemption proceeds)
paid to individuals and certain other non-corporate shareholders.
Withholding is not required if a shareholder certifies that the
shareholder's social security or tax identification number provided
to the Trust is correct and that the shareholder is not subject
to backup withholding for prior under-reporting to the Internal
Revenue Service.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Reports containing appropriate
information with respect to the Federal income tax status of dividends

or distributions of net long-term capital gain, if any, paid with
respect to the shares of a Fund held by a tax-deferred account
will not be taxable to that account. Currently, distributions
from such accounts will be taxable to individual participants
under applicable tax rules without regard to the character of
the income earned by the account.<BR>

<B><FONT SIZE=2>Management of the Funds</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The investment adviser to each Fund (the &quot;Adviser&quot;)
is Norwest Investment Management, a part of Norwest Bank Minnesota,
N.A. (&quot;Norwest&quot;). Norwest is a subsidiary of Norwest
Corporation, a multi-bank holding company that was incorporated
under the laws of Delaware in 1929. As of December 31, 1995, Norwest
Corporation was the 11th largest bank holding company in the United
States in terms of assets. As of that date, the Adviser managed
or provided investment advice with respect to assets totaling
approximately $23 billion. Except for International Fund, the
Adviser makes investment decisions for the Funds and continuously
reviews, supervises and administers each Fund's investment program.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Subject to the Adviser's general oversight, Crestone
Capital Management, Inc. (&quot;Crestone&quot;), a subsidiary
of Norwest, acts as investment subadviser to Small Company Stock
Fund. Subject to the Adviser's general oversight, Schroder Capital
Management International Inc. (&quot;Schroder&quot;) acts as investment
subadviser to Diversified Equity Fund, Growth Equity Fund and
each Balanced Fund (Schroder, Crestone and the Adviser are sometimes
referred to collectively as the &quot;Advisers&quot;). Schroder
also serves as International Portfolio's investment adviser. 
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Norwest serves as the Trust's transfer agent, dividend
disbursing agent and custodian, and provides certain administrative
services to International Fund. The manager of the Trust and distributor
of its shares is Forum Financial Services, Inc. (&quot;Forum&quot;).
Forum also serves as administrator of Core Trust. See &quot;Management
of the Funds - Investment Advisory Services&quot; and &quot;Administrative
and Other Services.&quot; <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Purchase and Redemption of Shares</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Shares of beneficial interest of each Fund are offered
without a sales charge and may be redeemed without charge. Norwest
offers investors in the Funds various periodic investment and
redemption services. The minimum initial investment in each Fund
is $1,000, except that the minimum initial investment in Ready
Cash Investment Fund is $100,000. See &quot;Purchases and Redemptions
of Shares.&quot; <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Certain Risk Factors</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>There can be no assurance that any Fund will achieve
its investment objective or that Ready Cash Investment Fund will
maintain a stable net asset value. Except for Ready Cash Investment
Fund, each Fund's net asset value will fluctuate based upon changes
in the value of the Fund's portfolio securities and, accordingly,
upon redemption an investment in a Fund may be worth more or less
than its original value. The Fixed Income Funds' net asset values
will tend to vary inversely with movements in interest rates and
the potential for appreciation in a Fixed Income Fund in the event
of a decline in interest rates may be limited or negated by increased
principal prepayments on certain mortgage-backed securities held
by the Fund. The policy of investing in smaller companies employed
by Small Company Stock Fund, Small Company Growth Fund and the
Equity Funds and Balanced Funds that invest in small company securities
entails certain risks in addition to those normally associated
with investments in equity securities. Similarly, Contrarian Stock
Fund's policy of investing in securities that may be out of favor
with many institutional investors and International Fund's policy
of investing directly or indirectly in foreign securities entail
certain risks in addition to those normally associated with investments
in equity securities. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>By investing solely in International Portfolio, International
Fund may achieve certain efficiencies and economies of scale.
Nonetheless, this investment could also have potential adverse
effects on International Fund. Investors in International Fund
should consider these risks, as described under &quot;Other Information
- Core Trust Structure.&quot; <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>An investment in any Fund involves certain risks,
depending on the types of investments made and the types of investment
techniques employed. All investments by the Funds entail some
risk. Certain investments and investment techniques, however,
entail additional risks, such as investments in foreign issuers,
issuers with limited market capitalization, mortgage- or asset-backed
securities, zero-coupon bonds and options, futures contracts,
forward contracts and swap agreements. The use of leverage by
certain Funds through borrowings, margin transactions, short sales,
reverse repurchase agreements and other investment techniques
involves additional risks. For more details about each Fund and
its investments and risks, see &quot;Investment Objectives, Policies
and Risk Considerations&quot; and &quot;Appendix A: Investments,
Investment Strategies and Risk Considerations.&quot; <BR>

<FONT SIZE=2>The purpose of the following table is to assist investors
in understanding the various expenses that an investor in the
Funds will bear directly or indirectly. There are no transaction
charges in connection with purchases, redemptions or exchanges
of Shares. None of the Funds has adopted a Rule 12b-1 plan with
respect to the Shares and, accordingly, no Fund incurs distribution

<I>*Effective April 1, 1996, Managed Fixed Income Fund will be
renamed &quot;Diversified Bond Fund.&quot; <BR>
</I>
<P>
(1) For a further description of the various expenses incurred
in the operation of the Funds, see &quot;Management of the Funds.&quot;
For Contrarian Stock Fund, Small Company Stock Fund, Total Return
Bond Fund and Ready Cash Investment Fund, the amounts of expenses
are based on amounts incurred during those Funds' most recent
fiscal year ended May 31, 1995 and for the other Funds during
their most recent fiscal year ended October 31, 1995. With respect
to Contrarian Stock Fund, Small Company Stock Fund, Index Fund
and Total Return Bond Fund, expense information has been restated
to reflect current expenses, as if these expenses had been in
effect for each Fund's most recent fiscal year. <BR>
<P>
The table reflects an increase in Income Equity Fund's advisory
fee from 0.50% which is expected to be approved by that Fund's
shareholders at a meeting to be held in April 1996. Prior to such
approval, the Fund will continue to pay an advisory fee of 0.50%
of its average daily net assets. <BR>
<P>
Absent actual (or, in the case of Contrarian Stock Fund, Small
Company Stock Fund and Total Return Bond Fund, estimated) expense
reimbursements and fee waivers, the Investment Advisory Fees of
Contrarian Stock Fund, Small Company Stock Fund, Managed Fixed
Income Fund, Total Return Bond Fund and Ready Cash Investment
Fund would be: 0.80%, 1.00%, 0.35%, 0.50% and 0.38% respectively.
Absent actual (or, in the case of Contrarian Stock Fund, Small
Company Stock Fund, Index Fund and Total Return Bond Fund, estimated)
expense reimbursements and fee waivers, Other Expenses and Total
Operating Expenses of each Fund would be, respectively: Diversified
Equity Fund: 0.43% and 1.08%; Growth Equity Fund: 0.44% and 1.34%;
Contrarian Stock Fund: 0.77% and 1.57%; Small Company Stock Fund:
0.81% and 1.81%; Small Company Growth Fund: 0.45% and 1.35%; Large
Company Growth Fund: 0.55% and 1.20%; International Fund: 1.21%
and 1.66%; Income Equity Fund: 0.62% and 1.27; Index Fund: 0.49%
and 0.64%; Conservative Balanced Fund: 0.51% and 0.96%; Moderate
Balanced Fund: 0.45% and 0.98%; Growth Balanced Fund: 0.45% and
1.03%; Intermediate U.S. Government Fund: 0.60% and 0.93%; Managed
Fixed Income Fund: 0.47% and 0.82%; Total Return Bond Fund: 0.67%
and 1.17%; Stable Income Fund: 0.68% and 0.98%; Ready Cash Investment
Fund: 0.35% and 0.73%. Fee waivers are voluntary and may reduced
or eliminated at any time. <BR>
<P>
(2) International Fund's Other Expenses include the Fund's pro
rata portion of the operating expenses of International Portfolio,
which will be borne indirectly by International Fund shareholders.
As long as its assets are invested in International Portfolio,
International Fund pays no investment advisory fees directly.
International Fund pays Forum a management fee, and Core Trust
pays Forum an administration fee for its services to International
Portfolio, of which International Fund bears its pro rata portion.
The Board of Trustees of the Trust believes that the aggregate
per share expenses of International Fund and International Portfolio
will be approximately equal to the expenses International Fund
would incur if its assets were invested directly in foreign securities.
Pursuant to an exemptive order obtained from the SEC, Diversified
Equity Fund, Growth Equity Fund, Conservative Balanced Fund, Moderate
Balanced Fund and Growth Balanced Fund invest portions of their
assets in other portfolios of Core Trust, each of which bears
certain expenses not reflected in the table. See &quot;Investment
Objectives, Policies and Risk Considerations - Investments in
Core Trust&quot; and &quot;Management of the Funds - Expenses
of the Funds.&quot;<BR>
<P>
(3) Other Expenses for the Funds include transfer agency fees
payable to Norwest at annual rates of 0.10% of Ready Cash Investment
Fund's average daily net assets attributable to Institutional
Shares and 0.25% of each other Fund's average daily net assets
attributable to I Shares. Other Expenses for Contrarian Stock
Fund, Small Company Stock Fund, Total Return Bond Fund and Ready
Cash Investment Fund also include custodial fees payable to Norwest
at a annual rate of up to 0.05% of each Fund's average daily net
assets; Norwest charges no custodian fees to the other Funds,
but they incur subcustodian fees. In addition, Other Expenses
for International Fund include administrative service fees payable
to Norwest of 0.25%. <BR>

The above table is a hypothetical example that indicates the expenses
an investor would pay assuming a $1,000 investment in each Fund,
a 5 percent annual return, reinvestment of all dividends and distributions,
and full redemption at the end of each period. The example is
based on the expenses listed in the &quot;Annual Fund Operating
Expenses&quot; table above. The 5 percent annual return is not
a prediction of and does not represent the Funds' projected returns;
rather, it is required by government regulation. <I>The example
should not be considered a representation of past or future expenses
or return. Actual expenses and return may be greater or less than
indicated. 2.</I>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The Funds offered through this Prospectus consist
of seventeen Funds, each with distinct investment objectives and
policies: nine Equity Funds, three Balanced Funds and five Fixed
Income Funds. Most of the Funds invest their assets in singular
investment styles that correspond to their objectives. Of the
Equity Funds, two Funds - Diversified Equity Fund and Growth Equity
Fund - invest their assets in several different equity investment
styles. The use of multiple equity investment styles by each of
these Funds - through percentage allocations consistent with the
Fund's investment objective - is intended to reduce the risk associated
with the use of a single style, which may move in and out of favor
during the course of a market cycle. The Balanced Funds invest
specified percentages of their assets in accordance with the investment
styles of Diversified Equity Fund and three to five different
fixed income investment styles. The Balanced Funds rebalance their
portfolios periodically and Diversified Equity Fund and Growth
Equity Fund rebalance their portfolios daily to maintain specified
percentages of assets invested in particular investment styles.
The percentage of a Fund's assets invested using a specified investment
style may be changed at any time by the Adviser in response to
market or other conditions. The investment objective, policies
and risk considerations of each Fund are described below. For

techniques and additional risk considerations associated with
those investments and techniques, see &quot;Investment Objectives,

<B><FONT SIZE=2>INVESTMENTS IN CORE TRUST</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>International Fund currently seeks to achieve its
investment objective by investing all of its investment assets
in International Portfolio, a separate Portfolio of Core Trust.
In addition, the Trust has received an exemptive order from the
SEC under which Diversified Equity Fund, Growth Equity Fund, Conservative
Balanced Fund, Moderate Balanced Fund and Growth Balanced Fund
(collectively the &quot;Blended Funds&quot;) currently invest
the portions of their assets that are managed in a small company,
an index and an international investment style, respectively,
in Small Company Portfolio, Index Portfolio, and International
Portfolio II (the &quot;Blended Portfolios&quot;). These Portfolios
are each separate portfolios of Core Trust. By pooling their assets
in the Blended Portfolios, the Blended Funds may be able to achieve
benefits that they could not achieve by investing directly in
securities. See &quot;Other Information - Core Trust Structure.&quot;
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The investment objectives and policies and investment
risk considerations for International Portfolio II and Index Portfolio
are identical to the investment objectives and policies and investment
risk considerations of International Fund and Index Fund. The
investment objective of Small Company Portfolio is to provide
long-term capital appreciation by investing primarily in small
and medium-sized domestic companies that are either growing rapidly
or completing a period of significant change. This Portfolio invests
its assets in the investment styles of Small Company Stock Fund
and Small Company Growth Fund and a small company &quot;value&quot;
investment style described below; in the future, this Portfolio
may invest its assets in accordance with additional small company
investment styles. <BR>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Equity Funds</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>To achieve their investment objectives, the Equity
Funds invest primarily in common stocks and other equity securities.
International Fund currently invests exclusively in International
Portfolio which invests primarily in common stocks and other equity
securities of foreign issuers. See &quot;Other Information - Core
Trust Structure.&quot; The domestic securities in which an Equity
Fund invests are generally listed on a securities exchange or
included in the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated
Quotation (NASDAQ) National Market System but may be traded in
the over-the-counter securities market. Under normal circumstances,
each of the Equity Funds will invest substantially all of its
assets, but not less than 65 percent of its total assets, in equity
securities.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Diversified Equity Fund</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>
follows a &quot;multi-style&quot; approach designed to minimize
the volatility and risk of investing in equity securities. The
Fund's portfolio combines five different equity investment styles,
those of four of the Equity Funds - Large Company Growth Fund,
International Fund, Income Equity Fund and Index Fund - and a
small company investment style (the &quot;Small Company style&quot;)
that in turn utilizes the investment styles of Small Company Stock
Fund and Small Company Growth Fund (the &quot;Small Company Stock
Fund style&quot; and the &quot;Small Company Growth Fund style,&quot;
respectively) and a small company value investment style (the
&quot;Small Company Value style&quot;). The Fund utilizes different
equity investment styles in order to reduce the risk of price
and return volatility associated with reliance on a single investment
style. Because Diversified Equity Fund blends five equity investment
styles, it is anticipated that its price and return volatility
will be less than that of Growth Equity Fund, which blends three
equity investment styles. The Fund generally invests the following
percentages of its total assets in the indicated investment styles:

The management of the Fund's assets is divided among the Fund's
six portfolio managers, including four who are also the portfolio
managers for corresponding Equity Funds. Three portfolio managers

response to market or other conditions. <BR>
<P>
<B>Growth Equity Fund</B> follows a &quot;multi-style&quot; approach
designed to reduce the volatility and risk of investing in equity
securities. The Fund's portfolio combines three different equity
investment styles, those of two of the Equity Funds - Large Company
Growth Fund and International Fund - and a small company investment
style (the &quot;Small Company style&quot;) that in turn utilizes
the investment styles of Small Company Stock Fund and Small Company
Growth Fund (the &quot;Small Company Stock Fund style&quot; and
the &quot;Small Company Growth Fund style,&quot; respectively)
and a small company value investment style (the &quot;Small Company
Value style&quot;). The Fund utilizes different equity investment
styles in order to reduce the risk of price and return volatility
associated with reliance on a single investment style. It is anticipated
that the Fund's price and return volatility will be somewhat greater
than those of Diversified Equity Fund, which blends five equity
investment styles. The Fund generally invests the following percentages

Investors should refer to the descriptions below of each of the
foregoing Equity Funds and the Small Company style for a discussion
of the objectives, policies and risks involved in the investments
and investment techniques of those styles and, accordingly, of
the portions of Growth Equity Fund invested using those styles.
The management of the Fund's assets is divided among the Fund's
four portfolio managers, including three who are also the portfolio
managers for corresponding Equity Funds. Three portfolio managers
jointly co-manage the assets allocated to the Small Company style.
The percentage of a Fund's assets invested using a particular
investment style may be changed at any time by the Adviser in
response to market or other conditions. <BR>
<P>
<B>Contrarian Stock Fund</B> invests according to the basic premise
of the Adviser's &quot;contrarian&quot; investment approach: that
security prices change more than fundamental investment values
because consensus thinking often results in severe undervaluation
of securities whose immediate problems are obvious and whose longer
term prospects are, therefore, viewed too negatively. This consensus
pessimism can create investment opportunity. Consistent with this
underlying approach, the Adviser will purchase stocks whose prices
are temporarily depressed, either because they are out of favor
with, or simply ignored by, the investment community. <BR>
<P>
The basis of the Adviser's contrarian investment approach is the
comparison of the value and the price of a security. The Adviser
generally analyzes a security's value in terms of recovery earnings
and potential share price over a three-year investment time horizon.
Typically, stocks that the Adviser considers for purchase will
tend to have significantly depressed prices and relatively low
price to book value ratios. <BR>
<P>
The Fund's policy of investing in securities that may be temporarily
out of favor differs from the investment approach followed by
many other mutual funds with a similar investment objective. Such
mutual funds typically do not invest in securities that have declined
sharply in price, are not widely followed, or are issued by companies
that may have reported poor earnings or that may have suffered
a cyclical downturn in business. The Adviser believes, however,
that purchasing securities depressed by temporary factors may
provide investment returns superior to those obtained when premium
prices are paid for issues currently in favor. <BR>
<P>
The Fund may invest in preferred stock and securities convertible
into common stock and may invest up to 20 percent of its total
assets in foreign securities and in American Depository Receipts
and other similar securities of foreign issuers. See &quot;Investment
Policies - Equity Funds - International Fund - Foreign Investment
Risks and Considerations.&quot; In addition, the Fund may invest
in fixed income securities that are rated, at the time of purchase,
within the three highest rating categories assigned by a nationally
recognized statistical rating organization such as Moody's Investors
Service, Standard &amp; Poor's and Fitch Investors Service L.P.,
or which are unrated and determined by the Adviser to be of comparable
quality. These instruments may have fixed, floating or variable
rates of interest. See &quot;Additional Investment Policies -
Fixed Income Securities and Their Characteristics.&quot; <BR>
<P>
<B>Small Company Stock Fund, Small Company Growth Fund and the
Small Company style</B> each invest primarily in the common stock
of small and medium size domestic companies which have a market
capitalization well below that of the average company in the Standard
&amp; Poor's 500 Composite Stock Price Index. Market capitalization
refers to the total market value of a company's outstanding shares
of common stock. Small Company Stock Fund considers small and
medium companies as those whose market capitalizations are less
than $1 billion at the time of the Fund's purchase, although it
is anticipated that investments will be primarily in companies
with capitalizations of less than $750 million. Small Company
Growth Fund considers small and medium companies to be those with
market capitalizations less than $750 million at the time of the
Fund's purchase. <BR>
<P>
Under normal circumstances, Small Company Stock Fund, Small Company
Growth Fund and the components of the other Funds that invest
in the Small Company style will invest at least 65 percent of
their total assets in common stock issued by small and medium
size companies. <BR>
<P>
In selecting securities for <B>Small Company Stock Fund</B>, the
Adviser seeks securities with significant price appreciation potential,
and attempts to identify companies that show above-average growth,
as compared to long-term overall market growth. The companies
in which the Fund invests may be in a relatively early stage of
development or may produce goods and services which have favorable
prospects for growth due to increasing demand or developing markets.
Frequently, such companies have a small management group and single
product or product line expertise that, in the view of the Adviser,
may result in an enhanced entrepreneurial spirit and greater focus
which may allow the firms to be successful. The Adviser believes
that such companies may develop into significant business enterprises
and that an investment in such companies offers a greater opportunity
for capital appreciation than an investment in larger more established
entities. Small companies frequently retain a large part of their
earnings for research, development and investment in capital assets,
however, so that the prospects for immediate dividend income are
limited. <BR>
<P>
Small Company Stock Fund may invest in preferred stock and securities
convertible into common stock and may invest up to 20 percent
of its total assets in foreign securities and in American Depository
Receipts, European Depository Receipts and other similar securities
of foreign issuers. See &quot;Investment Policies - Equity Funds
- International Fund - Foreign Investment Risks and Considerations.&quot;
In addition, the Fund may invest in fixed income securities of
small companies that are rated, at the time of purchase, within
the three highest rating categories assigned by a nationally recognized
statistical rating organization such as Moody's Investors Service,
Standard &amp; Poor's and Fitch Investors Service, L.P., or which
are unrated and determined by the Adviser to be of comparable
quality. These instruments may have fixed, floating or variable
rates of interest. See &quot;Additional Investment Policies -
Fixed Income Securities and Their Characteristics.&quot; <BR>
<P>
In selecting securities for <B>Small Company Growth Fund</B>,
the Adviser seeks to identify companies that are rapidly growing
(usually with relatively short operating histories) or that are
emerging from a period of investor neglect by undergoing a dramatic
change. These changes may involve a sharp increase in earnings,
the hiring of new management or measures taken to close the gap
between its share price and takeover/asset value. The Fund may
invest up to 10 percent of its total assets in foreign securities
and in American Depository Receipts and other similar securities
of foreign issuers. See &quot;Investment Policies - Equity Funds
- International Fund - Foreign Investment Risks and Considerations.&quot;
The Fund may not invest more than 10 percent of its total assets
in the securities of a single issuer. The Fund does not currently
invest in preferred stock and securities convertible into common
stock but reserves the right to do so in the future. <BR>
<P>
In selecting securities allocated to the <B>Small Company style</B>
component of Growth Equity Fund, Diversified Equity Fund and the
Balanced Funds, the Adviser uses the Small Company Stock Fund
style, the Small Company Growth Fund style and the Small Company
Value style, currently allocating 1/3 of its assets to each style.
<BR>
<P>
<I>Prior to December 11, 1995, the Small Company style did not
allocate any assets to the Small Company Value style. The allocation
of 1/3 of assets invested in the Small Company style to the Small
Company Value style is expected to be complete by June 1, 1996.
The Small Company style may in the future allocate its assets
to additional investment styles.</I> <BR>
<P>
In selecting portfolio investments, the Small Company Value style
focuses on securities that are conservatively valued in the marketplace
relative to their underlying fundamentals. Value investing provides
investors with a less aggressive way to take advantage of growth
opportunities of small companies. In investing in accordance with
this style, the Adviser will seek to invest in stocks priced low
relative to the stock of comparable companies, determined by price/earnings
ratios, cash flows or other measures. Value investing therefore
may reduce downside risk while offering potential for capital
appreciation as a stock gains favor among other investors and
its stock price rises. <BR>
<P>
<B>Small Company Investment Risks and Considerations.</B> The
companies in which Small Company Stock Fund, Small Company Growth
Fund and the Small Company style components of the other Funds
invest may be in a relatively early stage of development or may
produce goods and services which have favorable prospects for
growth due to increasing demand or developing markets. Frequently,
such companies have a small management group and single product
or product line expertise. These characteristics may result in
an enhanced entrepreneurial spirit and greater focus which may
make those companies successful. The Adviser believes that such
companies may develop into significant business enterprises and
that an investment in such companies offers a greater opportunity
for capital appreciation than an investment in larger more established
entities. Small companies frequently retain a large part of their
earnings for research, development and investment in capital assets,
however, so that the prospects for immediate dividend income are
limited. <BR>
<P>
Investments in smaller companies generally involve greater risks
than investments in larger companies due to the small size of
the issuer and the fact that the issuer may have limited product
lines, access to financial markets and management depth. In addition,
many of the securities of smaller companies trade less frequently
and in lower volumes than securities issued by larger firms. The
result is that the short-term price volatility of small company
securities is greater than the short-term price volatility of
the securities of larger, more established companies that are
widely held. The securities of small companies may also be more
sensitive to market changes generally than the securities of large
companies. In addition, securities that are traded in the over-the-counter
market or on a regional securities exchange may not be traded
every day or in the volume typical of securities traded on a national
securities exchange. As a result, disposition of a portfolio security,
to meet redemptions by shareholders or otherwise, may require
a Fund to sell the security at a discount from market prices,
to sell during periods when disposition is not desirable, or to
make many small sales over an extended period. <BR>
<P>
While securities issued by smaller companies historically have
experienced greater market appreciation than the securities of
larger entities, there is no assurance that they will continue
to do so or that the Fund will be successful in identifying companies
whose securities will appreciate. <BR>
<P>
<B>Large Company Growth Fund</B> invests primarily in the common
stock of large, high-quality domestic companies that have superior
growth potential. Large companies are those whose market capitalizations
are at least $500 million at the time of the Fund's purchase and
whose equity trading volume would permit the sale or purchase
of a large position in the securities of the company in 2 or 3
trading days. Market capitalization refers to the total market
value of a company's outstanding shares of common stock. In selecting
securities for the Fund, the Adviser seeks issuers whose stock
is attractively valued and whose fundamental characteristics both
are significantly better than the market average and which support
internal earnings growth capability. The Fund's holdings may include
the securities of companies whose growth potential is, in the
Adviser's opinion, generally unrecognized or misperceived by the
market. In addition, the Fund may invest up to 20 percent of its
total assets in American Depository Receipts, European Depository
Receipts and other similar securities of large foreign issuers
and may attempt to reduce the overall risk of its foreign investments
by using foreign currency forward contracts. See &quot;Investment
Policies - Equity Funds - International Fund - Foreign Investment
Risks and Considerations.&quot; Under normal circumstances, the
Fund will not invest more than 10 percent of its total assets
in the securities of a single issuer. The Fund does not currently
invest in preferred stock or securities convertible into common
stock but reserves the right to do so in the future. <BR>
<P>
<B>International Fund</B> is designed for investors who desire
to achieve international diversification of their investments
by participating in foreign securities markets. Because international
investments generally involve risks in addition to those risks
associated with investments in the United States, the Fund should
be considered only as a vehicle for international diversification.
<BR>
<P>
As the Fund has the same investment policies as International
Portfolio and currently invests all of its assets in International
Portfolio, the following investment policies are discussed with
respect to International Portfolio only. International Portfolio
normally will invest substantially all of its assets in equity
securities of companies domiciled outside the United States. International
Portfolio selects its investments on the basis of their potential
for capital appreciation without regard to current income. The
Portfolio also may invest in the securities of closed-end investment
companies investing primarily in foreign securities and may invest
in debt obligations of foreign governments or their political
subdivisions, agencies or instrumentalities, and debt obligations
of supranational organizations and foreign corporations. Investment
will be diversified among securities of issuers in foreign countries
including, but not limited to, Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom,
France, the Netherlands, Hong Kong, Singapore and Australia. In
general, International Portfolio will invest only in securities
of companies and governments in countries that Schroder, in its
judgment, considers both politically and economically stable.
International Portfolio has no limit on the amount of its foreign
assets which may be invested in any one type of foreign instrument
or in any foreign country; however, to the extent International
Portfolio concentrates its assets in a foreign country, it will
incur greater risks. <BR>
<P>
International Portfolio may purchase preferred stock and securities
convertible into common stock, and may purchase American Depository
Receipts, European Depository Receipts or other similar securities
of foreign issuers. International Portfolio may also enter into
foreign exchange contracts, including forward contracts to purchase
or sell foreign currencies, in anticipation of its currency requirements
and to protect against possible adverse movements in foreign exchange
rates. Although such contracts may reduce the risk of loss to
International Portfolio from adverse movements in currency values,
the contracts also limit possible gains from favorable movements.
<BR>
<P>
<B>Foreign Investment Risks and Considerations.</B> All investments,
domestic and foreign, involve certain risks. Investments in the
securities of foreign issuers may involve risks in addition to
those normally associated with investments in the securities of
U.S. issuers. All foreign investments are subject to risks of
foreign political and economic instability, adverse movements
in foreign exchange rates, the imposition or tightening of exchange
controls or other limitations on repatriation of foreign capital,
and changes in foreign governmental attitudes towards private
investment, possibly leading to nationalization, increased taxation
or confiscation of foreign investors' assets. <BR>
<P>
Moreover, dividends payable on foreign securities may be subject
to foreign withholding taxes, thereby reducing the income available
for distribution to International Portfolio's shareholders; commission
rates payable on foreign transactions are generally higher than
in the United States; foreign accounting, auditing and financial
reporting standards differ from those in the United States and,
accordingly, less information may be available about foreign companies
than is available about issuers of comparable securities in the
United States; and foreign securities may trade less frequently
and with lower volume and may exhibit greater price volatility
than U.S. securities. <BR>
<P>
Changes in foreign exchange rates will also affect the value in
U.S. dollars of all foreign currency-denominated securities held
by International Portfolio. Exchange rates are influenced generally
by the forces of supply and demand in the foreign currency markets
and by numerous other political and economic events occurring
outside the United States, many of which may be difficult, if
not impossible, to predict. <BR>
<P>
Income from foreign securities will be received and realized in
foreign currencies, and International Portfolio is required to
compute and distribute income in U.S. dollars. Accordingly, a
decline in the value of a particular foreign currency against
the U.S. dollar will reduce the dollars available to make a distribution.
Similarly, if the exchange rate declines between the time after
International Portfolio's income has been earned and computed
in U.S. dollars and the time it is paid may require International
Portfolio to liquidate portfolio securities to acquire sufficient
U.S. dollars to make a distribution. Similarly, if the exchange
rate declines between the time International Portfolio incurs
expenses in U.S. dollars and the time such expenses are paid,
International Portfolio may be required to liquidate additional
foreign securities to purchase the U.S. dollars required to meet
such expenses.<BR>
<P>
<B>Income Equity Fund</B> invests primarily in the common stock
of large, high-quality domestic companies that have above-average
return potential based on current market valuations. Primary emphasis
is placed on investing in securities of companies with above-average
dividend income. In selecting securities for the Fund, the Adviser
uses various valuation measures, including above-average dividend
yields and below industry average price to earnings, price to
book and price to sales ratios. The Fund considers large companies
to be those whose market capitalizations are at least $600 million
at the time of the Fund's purchase. Market capitalization refers
to the total market value of a company's outstanding shares of
common stock. The Fund may also invest in preferred stock and
securities convertible into common stock and may purchase American
Depository Receipts, European Depository Receipts and other similar
securities of foreign issuers. See &quot;Investment Policies -
Equity Funds - International Fund - Foreign Investment Risks and
Considerations.&quot; Under normal circumstances, the Fund will
not invest more than 10 percent of its total assets in the securities
of a single issuer. <BR>
<P>
<B>Index Fund</B> is designed to duplicate the return of the Standard
&amp; Poor's 500 Composite Stock Index (the &quot;Index&quot;)
with minimum tracking error, while also minimizing transaction
costs. Under normal circumstances, the Fund will hold stocks representing
96 percent or more of the capitalization-weighted market values
of the Index. Portfolio transactions for the Fund generally are
executed only to duplicate the composition of the Index, to invest
cash received from portfolio security dividends or shareholder
investments in the Fund, and to raise cash to fund Share redemptions.
The Fund may hold cash or cash equivalents for the purpose of
facilitating payment of the Fund's expenses or Share redemptions.
For these and other reasons, the Fund's performance can be expected
to approximate but not be equal to that of the Index. <BR>
<P>
The Fund may utilize index futures contracts to a limited extent.
Index futures contracts are bilateral agreements pursuant to which
two parties agree to take or make delivery of an amount of cash
equal to a specified dollar amount times the difference between
the index value at the close of trading of the contract and the
price at which the futures contract is originally struck. As no
physical delivery of securities comprising the index is made,
a purchaser of index futures contracts may participate in the
performance of the securities contained in the index without the
required capital commitment. Index futures contracts may be used
for several reasons: to simulate full investment in the underlying

The Index tracks the total return performance of 500 common stocks
which are chosen for inclusion in the Index by Standard &amp;
Poor's (&quot;S&amp;P&quot;) on a statistical basis. The inclusion
of a stock in the Index in no way implies that S&amp;P believes
the stock to be an attractive investment. The 500 securities,
most of which trade on the New York Stock Exchange, represent
approximately 70 percent of the total market value of all U.S.
common stocks. Each stock in the Index is weighted by its market
value. Because of the market-value weighting, the 50 largest companies
in the Index currently account for approximately 45 percent of
its value. The Index emphasizes large-capitalizations and, typically,
companies included in the Index are the largest and most dominant
firms in their respective industries. <BR>

<B><FONT SIZE=2>Balanced Funds</FONT></B>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Conservative Balanced Fund, Moderate Balanced
Fund and Growth Balanced Fund</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2> each invest
in a balanced portfolio of fixed income and equity securities.
Conservative Balanced Fund has the smallest equity securities
component of the three Funds and is the most conservative Balanced
Fund. Growth Balanced Fund has the largest equity securities component
of the three Balanced Funds and is the most aggressive of these
Funds. The equity portion of each Balanced Fund's portfolio uses
the five different equity investment styles of Diversified Equity
Fund. Diversified Equity Fund combines the different equity investment
styles of four of the Equity Funds - Large Company Growth Fund,
International Fund, Income Equity Fund and Index Fund - and investment
in a small company investment style (the &quot;Small Company style&quot;)
in order to reduce the risk of relying on a single equity investment
style. See &quot;Investment Policies - Equity Funds - Diversified
Equity Fund.&quot; The blending of different equity investment
styles is intended to reduce the price and return volatility of
the equity portion of the Balanced Funds. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The fixed income portion of each Balanced Fund's
portfolio uses from three to five different fixed income investment
styles. Conservative Balanced Fund uses five fixed income investment
styles - the investment styles of Managed Fixed Income Fund, Total
Return Bond Fund and Stable Income Fund (the &quot;Managed Fixed
Income Fund style,&quot; the &quot;Total Return Bond Fund style&quot;
and the &quot;Stable Income Fund style,&quot; respectively), a
&quot;positive return&quot; investment style (the &quot;Positive
Return style&quot;) and a short maturity investment style (the
&quot;Short Maturity style&quot;). Moderate Balanced Fund uses
four fixed income investment styles - the Managed Fixed Income
Fund style, the Total Return Bond Fund style, the Stable Income
Fund style and the Positive Return style. Growth Balanced Fund
uses three fixed income investment styles - the Managed Fixed
Income Fund style, the Total Return Bond Fund style and the Positive
Return style. The blending of different fixed income investment
styles is intended to reduce the risk associated with relying
on a single fixed income investment style. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The base allocation among investment styles for each
Balanced Fund is set forth below. As market values of the Funds'
assets change, the percentage of Fund assets invested in any style
may temporarily deviate from the base allocations. In response
thereto, the Adviser will periodically effect transactions for
the Balanced Funds to reestablish their base allocations. In addition,
as the securities markets change, the Adviser may attempt to enhance
the returns of any of the Balanced Funds by changing, within certain
limits, the percentage of Fund assets invested in fixed income
and equity securities. The Adviser may, in its discretion, increase
or decrease the fixed income and equity percentages by up to 5
percent for Conservative Balanced Fund, 10 percent for Moderate
Balanced Fund and 15 percent for Growth Balanced Fund. For example,
the Managed Fixed Income Fund style, the Total Return Bond Fund
style and the Positive Return style of Growth Balanced Fund, each
of which is used currently with respect to 11 2/3 percent of that
Fund's assets (a total of 35 percent), may each be increased to
16 2/3 percent (a total of 50 percent) or decreased to 6 2/3 percent
(a total of 20 percent) of that Fund's assets. In making these
changes, each Balanced Fund is required to limit its redemptions
to no more than 1 percent of a Blended Portfolio's net assets
during any period of less than thirty days. Absent unstable market
conditions, the Adviser does not anticipate making a substantial
number of percentage changes. When the Adviser believes a change
in the base allocation percentages is desirable, it will sell
and purchase securities to effect the change. When the Adviser
believes that a change will be temporary (generally, 3 years or
less), it may choose to effect the change by using futures contract
strategies as described below in &quot;Temporary Allocations.&quot;

Investors should refer to the descriptions of Diversified Equity
Fund (and the five investment styles used by that Fund), Managed
Fixed Income Fund and Total Return Bond Fund for a discussion
of the objectives, policies and risks involved in the investments
and investment techniques of those Funds which relate to the portions
of Growth Balanced Fund that are invested using their investment
styles. The investment policies related to the Positive Return
style are listed below. Management of the Fund's assets is divided
among the Fund's nine portfolio managers - the portfolio managers
of Diversified Equity Fund, Managed Fixed Income Fund and Total
Return Bond Fund and the portfolio managers who manage assets
allocated to the Positive Return style. The percentage of a Fund's
assets invested using a particular investment style may be changed
at any time by the Adviser in response to market or other conditions.
<BR>
<P>
The <B>Positive Return style</B> seeks positive total return each
calendar year regardless of the bond market by investing in a
portfolio of U.S. Government and corporate fixed income investments.
The Adviser's investment with respect to assets invested in this
investment style are divided into two components, short bonds
with maturities of 2 years or less and long bonds with maturities
of 25 years or more. Shifts between short bonds and long bonds
are made based on movement in the prices of bonds rather than
on the Adviser's forecast of interest rates. During periods of
falling prices (generally, increasing interest rate environments)
long bonds are sold to protect capital and limit losses. Conversely,
when bond prices rise, long bonds are purchased. Accordingly,
the average maturity of the portfolio of securities invested in
the Positive Return style will vary. It is anticipated that under
normal circumstances the portfolio of securities invested in this
investment style will have an average dollar-weighted maturity
of between 1 and 30 years. <BR>
<P>
Under normal circumstances, at least 50 percent of the net assets
allocated to this style will be U.S. Government Securities, including
Treasury securities. All securities allocated to this style will
be, at the time of purchase, (i) rated in one of the two highest
long-term rating categories assigned by a nationally recognized
statistical rating organization such as Moody's Investors Service,
Standard &amp; Poor's and Fitch Investors Service, L.P. or (ii)
unrated and determined by the Adviser to be of comparable quality.
No more than 25 percent may be in the second highest rating category.
Investments may include zero-coupon securities, securities with
variable or floating rates of interest and asset-backed securities,
but only 25 percent of the net assets allocated to this investment
style, in the aggregate, may be invested in these securities.
The Positive Return style may not invest in convertible securities,
mortgage pass-through securities or private placement securities.
Within these constraints, the Adviser purchases securities that
it believes have above-average yields. <BR>
<P>
The Short Maturity style seeks to provide a higher total return
than is generally available from money market funds. The assets
allocated to the Short Maturity style will be invested in a portfolio
of high-quality fixed and variable rate fixed income securities.
This investment style is managed to increase income and preserve
or enhance total return by actively managing average portfolio
maturity in light of market conditions and trends. Investments
may include a broad spectrum of short-term instruments of United
States and foreign issuers, including U.S. Government Securities,
and the debt securities of financial institutions, corporations,
foreign governments, municipal governments, supranational organizations
and others. Investments are limited to instruments with a remaining
maturity of 5 years or less. With respect to assets allocated
to this style, the Fund will maintain a dollar-weighted average
portfolio maturity of 1 year or less and, under normal circumstances,
will maintain 50 percent of the assets in instruments with a maturity
of under 1 year. Up to 25 percent of the assets may be non-U.S.
dollar denominated and, with respect to those assets, the Adviser
will attempt to hedge currency fluctuation risk. Investments may
include mortgage-backed securities and other asset-backed securities,
limited to not more than 50 percent and 25 percent, respectively,
of the assets allocated to this investment style. The Fund may
enter into &quot;dollar roll&quot; transactions related to these
investments and may purchase stripped mortgage-backed securities.
The Fund may invest up to 10 percent of its assets allocated to
the style in guaranteed investment contracts issued by insurance
companies. The securities allocated to the style may have variable
or floating rates of interest or principal and may include participation
interests and Municipal Securities. Municipal Securities include
obligations of the states, territories or possessions of the United
States and their subdivisions, authorities and corporations. 
<BR>
<P>
All securities allocated to the Short Maturity style will be,
at the time of purchase, (i) rated in one of the two highest short-term
rating categories by two Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating
Organizations (&quot;NRSROs&quot;) (or, if only one NRSRO has
issued a rating, by that NRSRO), (ii) rated in one of the three
highest long-term rating categories by two NRSROs (or, if only
one NRSRO has issued a rating, by that NRSRO), or (iii) unrated
and determined by the Adviser to be of comparable quality. Of
the securities allocated to this style, no more than 5 percent
may be in any of the lowest permissible rating categories. <BR>
<P>
In order to manage its exposure to different types of investments,
when investing in this style the Adviser may enter into interest
rate, currency and mortgage swap agreements and may purchase and
sell interest rate caps, floors and collars. With respect to assets
invested in this style, the Adviser may also engage in certain
strategies involving options (both exchange-traded and over-the-counter)
to attempt to enhance the return on assets invested in this style
and may attempt to reduce the overall risk of those assets or
limit the uncertainty in the level of future foreign exchange
rates (hedge) by using options and futures contracts and foreign
currency forward contracts. The Adviser's ability to use these
strategies with respect to this style may be limited by market
considerations, regulatory limits and tax considerations. In investing
in accordance with this style, the Adviser may write covered call
and put options, buy put and call options, buy and sell interest
rate and foreign currency futures contracts and buy options and
write covered options on those futures contracts. An option is
covered if, so long as the respective Fund is obligated under
the option, it owns an offsetting position in the underlying security
or futures contract or maintains a segregated account of liquid,
high-grade debt instruments with a value at all times sufficient
to cover the Fund's obligations under the option.<BR>
<P>
<B>Temporary Allocations</B>. In its discretion, the Adviser may
increase or decrease the percentage of assets of each Balanced
Fund that are invested in fixed income and equity securities.
When the Adviser believes that a percentage reallocation will
be of short duration (generally, up to 3 years), the Adviser may
determine to achieve the economic equivalent of a reallocation
without incurring securities transaction costs by using futures
contracts rather than selling and purchasing securities. Under
this strategy, to the extent of the percentage asset allocation
change, the Fund would not be invested in nor subject to the risks
related to the types of individual securities purchased in accordance
with the various investment styles used by the Fund. Rather, the
Fund would be invested in and subject to the risks related to
futures contracts. For a description of futures contracts and
their risks, see &quot;Appendix A: Investments, Investment Strategies
and Risk Considerations - Futures Contracts and Options.&quot;

<B><FONT SIZE=2>Intermediate U.S. Government Fund</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>
seeks to attain its investment objective by investing primarily
in fixed and variable rate U.S. Government Securities. Under normal
circumstances, the Fund intends to invest at least 65 percent
of its assets in U.S. Government Securities and may invest up
to 35 percent of its assets in fixed income securities that are
not U.S. Government Securities. The Fund emphasizes the use of
intermediate maturity securities to lessen interest rate risk,
while employing low risk yield enhancement techniques to add to
the Fund's return over a complete economic or interest rate cycle,
such as adjustable rate securities and swap agreements. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The securities in which the Fund invests will include
mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities, although the
Fund will limit these investments to not more than 50 percent
and 25 percent, respectively, of its total assets. As part of
its mortgage-backed securities investments, the Fund may enter
into &quot;dollar roll&quot; transactions. Certain fixed income
securities are &quot;zero-coupon&quot; securities and the Fund
will limit its investment in these securities, except those issued
through the U.S. Treasury's STRIPS program, to not more than 10
percent of the Fund's total assets. The Fund may also invest in
securities that are restricted as to disposition under the Federal
securities laws (sometimes referred to as &quot;private placements&quot;
or &quot;restricted securities&quot;). In addition, the Fund may
not invest more than 25 percent of its total assets in securities
issued or guaranteed by any single agency or instrumentality of
the U.S. Government, except the U.S. Treasury. The Fund may make
short sales and may purchase securities on margin (borrow money
in order to purchase securities), which are considered speculative
investment techniques. See &quot;Appendix A: Investments, Investment
Strategies and Risk Considerations - Short Sales&quot; and &quot;-
Purchasing Securities on Margin.&quot; <BR>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The Fund primarily will invest in debt obligations
with maturities (or average life in the case of mortgage-backed
and similar securities) ranging from short-term (including overnight)
to 12 years. Under normal circumstances, the Fund's portfolio
of securities will have an average dollar-weighted maturity of
between 3 and 7 years. Under normal circumstances, the Fund's
portfolio of securities will have a duration of between 75 percent
and 125 percent of the duration of the Lehman Intermediate Government
Bond Index, which is used as the Fund's benchmark index as described
under &quot;Other Information - Fund Performance.&quot; Duration
is a measure of a debt security's average life that reflects the
present value of the security's cash flow and, accordingly, is
a measure of price sensitivity to interest rate changes (&quot;duration
risk&quot;). Because earlier payments on a debt security have
a higher present value, duration of a security, except a zero-coupon
security, will be less than the security's stated maturity. <BR>

<I>Each of the two new investment styles, based on disparate investment
criteria, tends to invest in debt obligations with either shorter
or longer maturities than the Fund's current investment style.
Reliance on multiple investment styles is intended to reduce the
price and return volatility of the Fund and provide more consistent
fixed income returns. For a description of each of the Total Return
Bond style and the Positive Return style, see &quot;Investment
Policies - Balanced Funds.&quot; <BR>
</I>
<P>
<B>Total Return Bond Fund</B> invests primarily in U.S. Government
Securities, including mortgage-backed securities, and investment
grade corporate fixed income securities. The Adviser's investment
decisions are based on its analysis of major changes in the direction
of interest rates rather than on attempts by the Adviser to predict
short-term interest rate fluctuations. The Adviser also applies
a contrarian perspective by looking for undervalued segments of
the fixed income market which the Adviser believes offer opportunities
for increased returns. <BR>
<P>
In making its investment decisions for the Fund, the Adviser focuses
on the maturity structure and quality structure of the Fund's
portfolio. When the Adviser's outlook is for rising interest rates
and falling bond values, the majority of the Fund's portfolio
will be invested in securities with short-term maturities in an
effort to ride interest rates up while minimizing the negative
effect of falling bond prices. When the Adviser anticipates interest
rates to fall and bond prices to increase, the Fund generally
will be invested in securities with long-term maturities in an
attempt to lock in high interest rates and capitalize on bond
price appreciation. Accordingly, the average maturity of the Fund's
portfolio will vary from 1 to 30 years. <BR>
<P>
The Fund may invest an unlimited amount of its assets in either
corporate securities, including corporate bonds, debentures and
notes, or U.S. Government Securities. The Fund will be invested
to a greater degree in corporate securities, however, as the spread
between corporate and U.S. Government Securities offers potential
for incremental returns. The Fund limits its investments in variable
or floating rate securities to 5 percent of its net assets. The
Fund does not currently invest in mortgage-backed securities or
enter &quot;dollar roll&quot; transactions, but reserves the right
to do so in the future. <BR>
<P>
The Fund may invest in preferred stocks and securities convertible
into common stock, but may not own the common stock into which
a convertible security converts. The Fund will only purchase securities
(including convertible securities) that are rated, at the time
of purchase, within the four highest long-term or two highest
short-term rating categories assigned by a nationally-recognized
statistical rating organization, such as Moody's Investors Service,
Standard &amp; Poor's and Fitch Investors Services, L.P., or which
are unrated and determined by the Adviser to be of comparable
quality. <BR>
<P>
<B>Stable Income Fund</B> seeks to maintain safety of principal
while providing low volatility total return by investing primarily
in investment grade short-term obligations. The Fund invests in
a diversified portfolio of fixed and variable rate U.S. dollar
denominated fixed income securities of a broad spectrum of United
States and foreign issuers, including U.S. Government Securities
and the debt securities of financial institutions, corporations,
and others. <BR>
<P>
The securities in which the Fund invests include mortgage-backed
and other asset-backed securities, although the Fund limits these
investments to not more than 60 percent and 25 percent, respectively,
of its total assets. In addition, the Fund limits its holdings
of mortgage-backed securities that are not U.S. Government Securities
to 25 percent of its total assets. The Fund may invest any amount
of its assets in U.S. Government Securities, but under normal
circumstances less than 50 percent of the Fund's total assets
are so invested. The Fund may invest in securities that are restricted
as to disposition under the Federal securities laws (sometimes
referred to as &quot;private placements&quot; or &quot;restricted
securities&quot;). In addition, the Fund may not invest more than
25 percent of its total assets in the securities issued or guaranteed
by any single agency or instrumentality of the U.S. Government,
except the U.S. Treasury, and may not invest more than 10 percent
of its total assets in the securities of any other issuer. <BR>
<P>
The Fund only purchases those securities that are rated, at the
time of purchase, within the three highest long-term or two highest
short-term rating categories assigned by a nationally recognized
statistical rating organization, such as Moody's Investors Service,
Standard &amp; Poor's or Fitch Investors Services, L.P., or which
are unrated and determined by the Adviser to be of comparable
quality. See &quot;Additional Investment Policies - Rating Matters&quot;
below. <BR>
<P>
The Fund invests in debt obligations with maturities (or average
life in the case of mortgage-backed and similar securities) ranging
from short-term (including overnight) to 12 years and seeks to
maintain an average dollar-weighted portfolio maturity of between
2 and 5 years. <BR>
<P>
In order to manage its exposure to different types of investments,
the Fund may enter into interest rate and mortgage swap agreements
and may purchase and sell interest rate caps, floors and collars.
The Fund may also engage in certain strategies involving options
(both exchange-traded and over-the-counter) to attempt to enhance
the Fund's income and may attempt to reduce the overall risk of
its investments or limit the uncertainty in the level of future
foreign exchange rates (hedge) by using options and futures contracts
and foreign currency forward contracts. The Fund's ability to
use these strategies may be limited by market considerations,
regulatory limits and tax considerations. The Fund may write covered
call and put options, buy put and call options, buy and sell interest
rate and foreign currency futures contracts and buy options and
write covered options on those futures contracts. An option is
covered if, so long as the Fund is obligated under the option,
it owns an offsetting position in the underlying security or futures
contract or maintains a segregated account of liquid, high-grade
debt instruments with a value at all times sufficient to cover
the Fund's obligations under the option. <BR>
<P>
<B>Ready Cash Investment Fund</B> invests in a broad spectrum
of high-quality, short-term money market instruments of United
States and foreign issuers that are determined by the Adviser,
pursuant to procedures adopted by the Board, to be eligible for
purchase and to present minimal credit risks. These instruments
may be U.S. Government Securities or the securities of financial
institutions, corporations, foreign governments, municipal governments,
supranational organizations and others. The Fund may invest only
in U.S. dollar-denominated instruments that have a remaining maturity
of 397 days or less (as calculated pursuant to Rule 2a-7 under
the Investment Company Act of 1940) and will maintain a dollar-weighted
average portfolio maturity of 90 days or less. The Fund may purchase
securities with ultimate maturities of greater than 397 days only
in accordance with Rule 2a-7. Under that Rule, only those long-term
instruments that have demand features which comply with certain
requirements and certain variable rate U.S. Government Securities
may be purchased. <BR>
<P>
The Fund normally will invest more than 25% of its total assets
in the obligations of domestic and foreign financial institutions,
their holding companies, and their subsidiaries. This concentration
may result in increased exposure to risks pertaining to the banking
industry. These risks include a sustained increase in interest
rates, which can adversely affect the availability and cost of
a bank's lending activities; exposure to credit losses during
times of economic decline; concentration of loan portfolios in
certain industries; regulatory developments; and competition among
financial institutions. The Fund may not invest more than 25%
of its total assets in any other single industry. <BR>
<P>
The securities in which the Fund invests will include mortgage-related
securities, asset-backed securities and participation interests
and may have variable or floating rates of interest or principal.
Except to the limited extent permitted by Rule 2a-7 and except
for U.S. Government Securities, the Fund will not invest more
than 5 percent of its total assets in the securities of any one
issuer. Also, the Fund may not purchase a security if the value
of all securities held by the Fund and issued or guaranteed by
the same issuer (including letters of credit in support of a security)
would exceed 10% of the Fund's total assets. In addition, to ensure
adequate liquidity, the Fund may not invest more than 10 percent
of its net assets in illiquid securities. Under the supervision
of the Board, the Adviser determines and monitors the liquidity
of portfolio securities. <BR>
<P>
High-quality instruments include those that (i) are rated (or,
if unrated, are issued by an issuer with comparable outstanding
short-term debt that is rated) in one of the two highest rating
categories by two nationally recognized statistical rating organizations
(&quot;NRSROs&quot;) or, if only one NRSRO has issued a rating,
by that NRSRO or (ii) are otherwise unrated and determined by
the Adviser to be of comparable quality. The Fund will invest
at least 95 percent of its total assets in securities in the highest
rating category (as determined pursuant to Rule 2a-7). <BR>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT POLICIES</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>All investment policies of a Fund that are designated
as fundamental, and each Fund's investment objective, may not
be changed without approval of the holders of a majority of the
Fund's outstanding voting securities. A majority of a Fund's outstanding
voting securities means the lesser of 67 percent of the shares
of the Fund present or represented at a shareholders' meeting
at which the holders of more than 50 percent of the shares are
present or represented, or more than 50 percent of the outstanding
shares of the Fund. Except as otherwise indicated, investment
policies of the Funds are not fundamental and may be changed by
the Board without shareholder approval.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Investment Limitations.</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>
The Funds have adopted the investment limitations listed below,
each of which is a nonfundamental policy except as noted. These
policies relate to each Fund and, unless otherwise noted, not
to a portion of a Fund invested in a particular investment style.
Other investment limitations, including additional provisions
with respect to the limitations listed below, are described in
the SAI. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Diversification</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>. Each
Fund is a &quot;diversified&quot; portfolio as defined in the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the &quot;1940 Act&quot;).
As a fundamental policy, with respect to 75 percent of its assets,
no Fund may purchase a security (other than a U.S. Government
Security) if, as a result, (i) more than 5 percent of the Fund's
total assets would be invested in the securities of a single issuer
or (ii) the Fund would own more than 10 percent of the outstanding
voting securities of any single issuer. International Fund may
invest up to 100 percent of its investment assets in the International
Portfolio and each other Fund (except Ready Cash Investment Fund)
reserves the right to invest all or a portion of its assets in
another diversified, open-end investment company with substantially
the same investment objective and policies as the Fund. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Concentration.</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2> Except
as noted below, each of the Funds is prohibited from concentrating
its assets in the securities of issuers in any industry. As a
fundamental policy, no Fund may purchase securities if, immediately
after the purchase, more than 25 percent of the value of the Fund's
total assets would be invested in the securities of issuers conducting
their principal business activities in the same industry. This
limit does not apply to investments in U.S. Government Securities,
foreign government securities, repurchase agreements covering
U.S. Government Securities or investment company securities. It
is currently anticipated that the Funds will not concentrate in
securities issued by any single foreign government. Under normal
circumstances, Ready Cash Investment Fund will invest more than
25 percent of its total assets in the obligations of domestic
and foreign financial institutions and their holding companies.
This concentration may result in increased exposure to risks pertaining
to the financial institution industry. These risks include a sustained
increase in interest rates, which can adversely affect the availability
and cost of a bank's lending activities; exposure to credit losses
during times of economic decline; concentration of loan portfolios
in certain industries; regulatory developments; and competition
among financial institutions. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Illiquid Securities.</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2> Each
of the Funds limits its purchase of illiquid securities. No Fund
may knowingly acquire securities or invest in repurchase agreements
with respect to any securities if, as a result, more than 15 percent
(10 percent for Ready Cash Investment Fund) of the Fund's net
assets taken at current value would be invested in securities
which are not readily marketable. Illiquid investments include
</FONT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">securities that are illiquid
by virtue of legal or contractual restrictions on the sale of
such securities and repurchase agreements not entitling the holder
to principal within 7 days. Under the supervision of the Board,
the Advisers determine and monitor the liquidity of portfolio
securities.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Bold">Borrowing and Lending. </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">As
a fundamental policy, each Fund may borrow money for temporary
or emergency purposes, including the meeting of redemption requests,
but not in excess of 33 1/3 percent of the value of the Fund's
total assets as computed immediately after the borrowing. Borrowing
for other than temporary or emergency purposes or meeting redemption
requests is limited to 5 percent of the value of each Fund's total
assets except in the case of Intermediate U.S. Government Fund,
Man-aged Fixed Income Fund and, with respect to their assets invested
in the Managed Fixed Income Fund style, the Balanced Funds. When
a Fund establishes a segregated account to limit the amount of
leveraging of the Fund with respect to certain investment techniques,
the Fund does not treat those techniques as involving borrowings
(although they may have characteristics and risks similar to borrowings
and result in the Fund's assets being leveraged). See &quot;Appendix
A: Investments, Investment Strategies and Risk Considerations
- Borrowing&quot; and &quot;Techniques Involving Leverage.&quot;
As a fundamental policy, no Fund may make loans except for loans
of portfolio securities, through the use of repurchase agreements,
and through the purchase of debt securities that are otherwise
permitted in-vestments for the Fund.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Bold">Margin and Short Sales. </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Except
for Intermediate U.S. Government Fund, no Fund may purchase securities
on margin or make short sales of securities, except short sales
against the box. These prohibitions do not restrict the Funds'
ability to use short-term credits necessary for the clearance
of port-folio transactions and to make margin deposits in connection
with permitted transactions in options and futures contracts.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Bold">Temporary Defensive Position.
</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">When business or financial
conditions warrant, each Fund may assume a temporary defensive
position and invest all or any portion of their assets in cash
or in cash equivalents, including (i) short-term U.S. Government
Securities, (ii) prime quality short-term instruments of commercial
banks, (iii) prime quality commercial paper, (iv) repurchase agreements
with banks and broker-dealers covering any of the securities in
which the Fund may invest directly and (v) shares of money market
mutual funds. During periods when and to the extent that a Fund
has assumed a temporary defensive position, it may not be pursuing
its investment objective. The Funds may from time to time maintain
investments in cash and cash equivalents pending investment in
securities. The International Portfolio and, with respect to the
portion of their assets managed by Schroder, Diversified Equity
Fund, Growth Equity Fund and each Balanced Fund, may hold cash
and bank instruments denominated in any major foreign currency.
Prime quality refers to the two highest short-term ratings of
a nationally recognized statistical rating organization.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Bold">Common Investment Techniques.
</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Each of the Funds may
enter into repurchase agreements (for reasons other than temporary
defensive purposes) and reverse repurchase agreements, may lend
their portfolio securities and may purchase portfolio securities
on a when-issued or forward commitment basis. It is currently
anticipated that the Equity Funds will not enter into reverse
repurchase agreements or purchase portfolio securities on a when-issued
or forward commitment basis to any significant extent.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Bold">Fixed Income Securities and
Their Characteristics. </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Although
each Fund only invests in investment grade fixed income securities,
including money market instruments, an investment in a Fund is
subject to risk even if all fixed income securities in the Fund's
portfolio are paid in full at maturity. All fixed income securities,
including U.S. Government Securities, can change in value when
there is a change in interest rates or the issuer's actual or
perceived creditworthiness or ability to meet its obligations.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">The market value of the interest-bearing
debt securities held by the Funds will be affected by changes
in interest rates. There is normally an inverse relationship between
the market value of securities sensitive to prevailing interest
rates and actual changes in interest rates. In other words, an
increase in interest rates produces a decrease in market value.
Moreover, the longer the remaining maturity of a security, the
greater will be the effect of interest rate changes on the market
value of that security. Changes in the ability of an issuer to
make payments of interest and principal and in the market's</FONT><FONT SIZE=2>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">perception of an issuer's
creditworthiness will also affect the market value of the debt
securities of that issuer. The possibility exists, therefore,
that, the ability of any issuer to pay, when due, the principal
of and interest on its debt securities may become impaired.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Fixed income securities include
those issued by the governments of foreign countries or by those
countries' political subdivisions, agencies or instrumentalities
as well as by supranational organizations such as the International
Bank for Reconstruction and Development. To the extent otherwise
permitted, the Funds may invest in these securities if the Adviser
or Schroder believes that the securities do not present risks
inconsistent with a Fund's investment objective.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Bold">Rating Matters. </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">The
Fixed Income Funds and, with respect to their assets invested
in fixed income investment styles, the Balanced Funds will invest
in securities rated in the categories specified by their investment
policies. The Funds also may purchase unrated securities if the
Adviser determines the security to be of comparable quality to
a rated security that the Fund may purchase. Unrated securities
may not be as actively traded as rated securities. Each Fund may
retain a security whose rating has been lowered below the Fund's
lowest permissible rating category (or that are unrated and determined
by the Adviser to be of comparable quality to securities whose
rating has been lowered below the Fund's lowest permissible rating
category) if the Adviser or Schroder, as appropriate, determines
that retaining the security is in the best interests of the Fund.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">The Fund's investments are subject
to &quot;credit risk&quot; relating to the financial condition
of the issuers of the securities that the Funds hold. To limit
credit risk, the Funds (other than Ready Cash Investment Fund)
may only invest in securities that are investment grade - rated
in the top four long-term investment grades by a nationally recognized
statistical rating organization (&quot;NRSRO&quot;) or in the
top two short-term investment grades by an NRSRO. Accordingly,
the lowest permissible long-term investment grades for corporate
bonds, including convertible bonds, are Baa in the case of Moody's
Investor Service (&quot;Moody's&quot;) and BBB in the case of
Standard &amp; Poor's (&quot;S&amp;P&quot;) and Fitch Investors
Service, L.P. (&quot;Fitch&quot;); the lowest permissible long-term
investment grades for preferred stock are Baa in the case of Moody's
and BBB in the case of S&amp;P and Fitch; and the lowest permissible
short-term investment grades for short-term debt, including commercial
paper, are Prime-2 (P-2) in the case of Moody's, A-2 in the case
of S&amp;P and F-2 in the case of Fitch. A further description
of the rating categories of certain NRSROs is contained in the
SAI. All these ratings are generally considered to be investment
grade ratings, although Moody's indicates that securities with
long-term ratings of Baa have speculative characteristics. As
a money market fund, Ready Cash Investment Fund has separate rating
restrictions.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Bold">Variable and Floating Rate Securities.
</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">The securities in which
the Funds invest may have variable or floating rates of interest
and, under certain limited circumstances, may have varying principal
amounts. These securities pay interest at rates that are adjusted
periodically according to a specified formula, usually with reference
to some interest rate index or market interest rate (the &quot;underlying
index&quot;). The interest paid on these securities is a function
primarily of the underlying index upon which the interest rate
adjustments are based. Such adjustments minimize changes in the
market value of the obligation and, accordingly, enhance the ability
of the Fund to maintain a stable net asset value. Similarly to
fixed rate debt instruments, variable and floating rate instruments
are subject to changes in value based on changes in market interest
rates or changes in the issuer's creditworthiness. The rate of
interest on securities purchased by a Fund may be tied to Treasury
or other government securities or indices on those securities
as well as any other rate of interest or index. Certain variable
rate securities(including mortgage-backed securities) pay interest
at a rate that varies inversely to prevailing short-term interest
rates (sometimes referred to as inverse floaters). For example,
upon reset the interest rate payable on a security may go down
when the underlying index has risen. During periods when short-term
interest rates are relatively low as compared to long-term interest
rates, a Fund may attempt to enhance its yield by purchasing inverse
floaters. Certain inverse floaters may have an interest rate reset
mechanism that multiplies the effects of changes in the underlying
index. While this form of leverage may increase the security's,
and thus the Fund's, yield, it may also increase the volatility
of the security's market value.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">There may not be an active secondary
market for any particular floating or variable rate instrument;
this could make it difficult for a Fund to dispose of the instrument
during periods of market volatility or economic uncertainty or
if the issuer's credit became impaired at a time when the Fund
was not entitled to exercise any demand rights it might have.
A Fund could, for this or other reasons, suffer a loss with respect
to the instrument. The Advisers monitor the liquidity of the Funds'
investments invariable and floating rate instruments, but there
can be no guarantee that an active secondary market will exist
at any time. Ready Cash Investment Fund also may purchase variable
and floating rate demand notes which are unsecured obligations
redeemable upon not more than 30 days' notice. These obligations
include master demand notes that permit investment of fluctuating
amounts at varying rates of interest pursuant to direct arrangement
with the issuer of the instrument. The issuer of these obligations
often has the right, after a given period, to prepay their outstanding
principal amount of the obligations upon a specified number of
days' notice. These obligations generally are not traded, nor
generally is there an established secondary market for these obligations.
To the extent a demand note does not have a seven day or shorter
demand feature and there is no readily available market for the
obligation, it is treated as an illiquid security.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Certain securities may have an
initial principal amount that varies over time based on an interest
rate index, and, accordingly, a Fund might be entitled to less
than the initial principal amount of the security upon the security's
maturity. The Funds intend to purchase these securities only when
the Adviser believes the interest income from the instrument justifies
any principal risks associated with the instrument. The Advisers
may attempt to limit any potential loss of principal by purchasing
similar instruments that are intended to provide an offsetting
increase in principal. There can be no assurance that an Adviser
will be able to limit the effects of principal fluctuations and,
accordingly, a Fund may incur losses on those securities even
if held to maturity without issuer default.<BR>

made after acceptance of an investor's subscription and funds.
An investor's funds will not be accepted or in-vested during the

Undercurrent IRA rules, by directly rolling over a distribution
from a Plan, investors can avoid the 20percent withholding tax

percent of the average annual daily net assets of the Fund in
the event that the Fund is not completely invested in International
Portfolio or another investment company. As International Fund
currently invests all of its assets in International Portfolio,
no fees are payable under that agreement. Pursuant to the investment
subadvisory agreements, the Adviser (and not the Trust) pays Schroder
a fee for its investment subadvisory services; however, that compensation
does not increase the amount paid by the Trust to the Adviser
pursuant to the Adviser's investment advisory agreements.<BR>

under its investment advisory agreement with respect to International
Portfolio II of Core Trust, Schroder receives from Core Trust
an advisory fee of 0.45 percent of International Portfolio II's
average annual daily net assets. Norwest waives all of the advisory
fees payable by Small Company Portfolio and Index Portfolio. Schroder
does not receive a subadvisory fee from any Blended Fund to the
extent that such Fund's assets are invested in International Portfolio
II, and Norwest reimburses International Portfolio II the amount
of the advisory fee the Portfolio pays to Schroder. Accordingly,
duplicative investment advisory fees are not incurred by any Fund.

Trust. Forum provides persons satisfactory to the Board to serve
as officers of the Trust. As of the date of this Prospectus, Forum
acted as manager and distributor of registered investment companies

Forum, whose principal business address is Two Portland Square,
Portland, Maine 04101, is a registered broker-dealer and investment

share-holders, maintaining requisite information flows between
the Fund and the investment adviser to International Portfolio,
monitoring and reporting to the Board on the performance of International
Portfolio and reimbursing the Fund for certain excess expenses.
No fees are payable under this service agreement in the event
that the International Fund is not completely invested in International

In addition, no Fund and no Portfolio of Core Trust has adopted
a Rule12b-1 Plan applicable to the Shares and, accordingly, no

Norwest serves as transfer agent and dividend disbursing agent

The Transfer Agent maintains an account for each shareholder of
the Trust (unless such accounts are maintained by sub-transfer
agents or processing agents), performs other transfer agency and
shareholder servicing functions for the Trust, and acts as dividend
disbursing agent for the Trust. The Transfer Agent is permitted
to subcontract any or all of its functions with respect to all
or any portion of the Trust's shareholders to one or more qualified
sub-transfer agents or processing agents, which may be its or
Forum's affiliates, who agree to comply with the terms of the
Transfer Agent's agreement with the Trust. The Transfer Agent
is permitted to compensate those agents for their services; however,
no such compensation may increase the aggregate amount of payments
by the Trust to the Transfer Agent. For its services, Norwest
is compensated at the annual rate of 0.25 percent of each Fund's
average annual daily net assets attributable to the Shares. In
the case of Ready Cash Investment Fund, Norwest is compensated
at an annual rate of 0.10percent of the Fund's average annual
daily net assets attributable to Institutional Shares and may
be reimbursed for certain expenses related to its transfer agency
services.<BR>

custodian and may appoint subcustodians for the foreign securities
and other assets held in foreign countries. Except as noted below,
Norwest currently receives no additional compensation for its
custodial services, but the Funds will incur the expenses and
costs of any subcustodian. International Fund and, to the extent
they invest in the International Fund style, each Blended Fund
indirectly incurs its pro rata portion of the custodial fees of
Core Trust. The Chase Manhattan Bank, N.A. serves as custodian
of International Portfolio and International Portfolio II and
is paid a fee by Core Trust for its services. Norwest serves as
custodian of Small Company Portfolio and Index Portfolio and currently
receives no additional compensation for its custodial services
with respect to those Portfolios. For its custodian services,
Norwest is compensated for providing custodian services to each

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Each Fund (as well as each Portfolio
of Core Trust) is obligated to pay for all of its expenses, although
Norwest has agreed to reimburse the Trust for certain of each
Fund's operating expenses which in any year exceed the limits
prescribed by any state in which the Fund's shares are qualified
for sale. For more information about Fund expenses, see &quot;Summary
- Expenses of Investing in the Funds.&quot; These expenses include:
interest charges; taxes; brokerage fees and commissions; certain
insurance premiums; applicable fees and expenses under the Trust's
or Core Trust's contracts with the Advisers, Forum, the Transfer
Agent and any custodian; fees of pricing, interest, dividend,
credit and other reporting services; costs of membership in trade
associations; auditing, legal and compliance expenses; costs of
preparing and printing the Trust's prospectuses, statements of
additional information and share-holder reports and delivering
them to existing shareholders; compensation of certain of the
Trust's or Core Trust's trustees, officers and employees and other
personnel performing services for the Trust or Core Trust; and
registration fees and related expenses.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Each Fund's expenses comprise
Trust expenses attributable to the Fund and expenses not attributable
to any particular portfolio of the Trust, which are allocated
among the Funds and all other portfolios of the Trust in proportion
to their average net assets. International Fund's expenses include
the Fund's pro rata share of the operating expenses of International
Portfolio, which are borne indirectly by International Fund's
shareholders. Although the Blended Portfolios do not incur investment
advisory fees, they do incur other administrative and operating
expenses. While the Blended Portfolios' expenses are not borne
directly by the Blended Funds, those expenses have the effect
of reducing the net investment income of the Blended Portfolios.
Expenses of each Blended Portfolio for the period ended October
31, 1995, as a percentage of average net assets, were: Small Company
Portfolio, 0.15 percent, Index Portfolio, 0.17percent and International
Portfolio II, 0.25 percent. Each Blended Fund incurs its pro rata
share of the Blended Portfolios' expenses, but only to the extent
it invests in a Blended Portfolio.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">The Advisers, Forum, the Transfer
Agent and any other service provider to the Funds, International
Portfolio or a Blended Portfolio may elect to waive all or a portion
of their fees. Any such waivers will have the effect of increasing
a Fund's performance for the period during which the waiver was
in effect. No fee waivers may be recouped at a later date. Other
than investment advisory fees, any fee paid by the Trust or Core
Trust may be increased by the Board or the board of trustees of
Core Trust without shareholder approval. Fee waivers are voluntary
and may be reduced or eliminated at any time.<BR>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Each service provider to the Trust
or their agents or affiliates may also act in various capacities
for, and receive compensation from, their customers who are shareholders
in a Fund. Under agreements with those customers, these entities
may elect to credit against the fees payable to them by their
customers or to rebate to customers all or a portion of any fee
received from the Trust with respect to assets of those customers
invested in the Funds.<BR>

<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="FranklinGothic-Demi">FUND PERFORMANCE</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Each Fund's performance may be
quoted in advertising in terms of yield or total return. Both
types are based on historical results and are not intended to
indicate future performance. The Funds' advertisements may reference
ratings and rankings among similar funds by independent evaluators
such as Morningstar, Lipper Analytical Services, Inc. and IBC/Donoghue,
Inc. In addition, the performance of a Fund may be compared to
recognized indices of market performance. The comparative material
found in the Funds' advertisements, sales literature or reports
to shareholders may contain performance ratings. This material
is not to be considered representative or indicative of future
performance.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Bold">Yield. </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">A
Fund's yield is a way of showing the rate of income earned by
the Fund as a percentage of the Fund's share price. Yield is calculated
by dividing the net investment income of the Fund for the stated
period by the average number of shares entitled to receive dividends
and expressing the result as an annualized percentage rate based
on the Fund's share price at the end of the period. A Fund may
also quote a compounded annualized yield which assumes the reinvestment
of dividends paid by the Fund and therefore will be somewhat higher
than the annualized yield for the same period.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Bold">Total Return. </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Total
Return refers to the average annual compounded rates of return
over some representative period that would equate an initial amount
invested at the beginning of a stated period to the ending redeemable
value of the investment, after giving effect to the reinvestment
of all dividends and</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"> </FONT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">distributions
and deductions of expenses during the period. Because average
annual returns tend to smooth out variations in a Fund's returns,
shareholders should recognize that they are not the same as actual
year-by-year results.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Bold">Performance Benchmarks. </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Each
of the Funds uses a benchmark securities index as a measure of
the Fund's performance. These indices may be comprised of a composite
of various recognized securities indices to reflect the investment
policies of Diversified Equity Fund, Growth Equity Fund and each
Balanced Fund, which invest their assets using different investment
styles. These indices are not used in the management of the Fund
but rather are standards by which the Advisers and shareholders
may compare the performance of a Fund to an unmanaged composite
of securities with similar, but not identical, characteristics
as the Fund. For instance, Index Fund's investment objective is
to duplicate the return of the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Composite
Stock Price Index. Accordingly, the Adviser generally uses that
index as a comparison to measure the performance of Index Fund.
The Funds may from time to time advertise a comparison of their
performance against any of these or other indices.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="FranklinGothic-Demi">BANKING LAW MATTERS</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Federal banking laws and regulations
generally permit a bank or bank affiliate to act as investment
adviser, transfer agent and custodian to an investment company
and to purchase shares of the investment company as agent for
and upon the order of a customer. Forum believes that Norwest
and any other bank or bank affiliate that may perform sub-transfer
agent or similar services or purchase shares as agent for its
customers may perform the services described in this Prospectus
for the Trust and its shareholders without violating applicable
Federal banking laws or regulations.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Federal or state statutes or regulations
and judicial or administrative decisions or interpretations relating
to the activities of banks and their affiliates, however, could
prevent a bank or bank affiliate from continuing to perform all
or a part of the activities contemplated by this Prospectus. If
Norwest or another bank or bank affiliate were prohibited from
so acting, its shareholder customers would be permitted to remain
shareholders of the Trust and alternative means for continuing
the servicing of such shareholders would besought. In this event,
changes in the operation of the Trust might occur and shareholders
serviced by the bank or bank affiliate might no longer be able
to avail themselves of its services. It is not expected that shareholders
would suffer any adverse financial consequences as a result of
any of these occurrences.<BR>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="FranklinGothic-Demi">PORTFOLIO TRANSACTIONS</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">The Advisers place orders for
the purchase and sale of assets they manage with brokers and dealers
selected by and in the discretion of the respective Adviser. The
Advisers seek &quot;best execution&quot; for all portfolio transactions,
but a Fund may pay higher than the lowest available commission
rates when an Adviser believes it is reasonable to do so in light
of the value of the brokerage, research and other services provided
by the broker effecting the transaction.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Commission rates for brokerage
transactions are fixed on many foreign securities exchanges, and
this may cause higher brokerage expenses to accrue to International
Fund and each other Fund that invests in foreign securities than
would be the case for comparable transactions effected on United
States securities exchanges.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Subject to the Funds' policy of
obtaining the best price consistent with quality of execution
of transactions, each Adviser may employ Norwest Investment Services,
Inc., Schroder Wertheim &amp; Company and other broker-dealer
affiliates of an Adviser (collectively &quot;Affiliated Brokers&quot;)
to effect brokerage transactions for the Funds. The Fund's payment
of commissions to Affiliated Brokers is subject to procedures
adopted by the Board and, with respect to the Portfolios of Core
Trust, Core Trust's board of trustees, to provide that the commissions
will not exceed the usual and customary broker's commissions charged
by unaffiliated brokers. No specific portion of a Fund's brokerage
will be directed to Affiliated Brokers and in no event will a
broker affiliated with an Adviser directing the transaction receive
brokerage transactions in recognition of research or other services
provided to the Adviser.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Tax rules applicable to short-term
trading may affect the timing of a Fund's portfolio transactions
or its ability to realize short-term trading profits or establish
short-term positions.<BR>

31, 1995, the annual turnover rates of Small Company Growth Fund,

106.55 percent, 240.90percent and 115.85 percent, respectively.
An annual turnover rate of 100 percent would occur if all of the
securities in a Fund were replaced once in a period of 1 year.
Higher portfolio turnover rates may result in higher taxable income
for shareholders and, with respect to Funds that invest in equity
securities, may result in increased brokerage costs to the Fund.
For more information about the port-folio transactions of the
Funds and International Portfolio, see the SAI.<BR>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">The Trust was originally organized
under the name &quot;Prime Value Funds, Inc.&quot; as a Maryland
corporation on August 29, 1986 and on July 30, 1993 was reorganized
as a Delaware business trust under the name &quot;Norwest Funds.&quot;
The Trust has an unlimited number of authorized shares of beneficial
interest. The Board may, without shareholder approval, divide
the authorized shares into an unlimited number of separate portfolios
or series (such as the Funds) and may divide portfolios or series
into classes of shares (such as I Shares), and the costs of doing
so will be borne by the Trust. Currently the authorized shares
of the Trust are divided into 30 series.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Bold">Other Classes of Shares. </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Each
Fund may issue shares of other classes. Funds of the Trust (except
money market funds) currently may issue three classes of shares,
I Shares, A Shares and B Shares, and may in the future create
additional class types. Contrarian Stock Fund, Small Company Stock
Fund, International Fund and Total Return Bond Fund currently
offer A Shares and B Shares in addition to I Shares. Diversified
Equity Fund, Growth Equity Fund, Income Equity Fund, Intermediate
U.S. Government Fund and Stable Income Fund plan to offer A Shares
and B Shares in April 1996. I Shares are offered to fiduciary,
agency and custodial clients of bank trust departments, trust
companies and their affiliates without any sales charges. A Shares
are sold with front-end sales charge or, in some cases, a contingent
deferred sales charge. B Shares are sold with a contingent deferred
sales charge and pay distribution fees. Ready Cash Investment
Fund currently has two classes of shares outstanding, Institutional
Shares and Investor Shares, and may in the future create additional
class types. Institutional Shares are offered with a minimum investment
of $100,000. Investor Shares are offered with a mini-mum investment
of $1,000 and incur greater transfer agency and other expenses
than Institutional Shares. Each class of a Fund will have a different
expense ratio and may have different sales charges(including distribution
fees). Each class's performance is affected by its expenses and
sales charges. For more information on any other class of shares
of the Funds investors may contact the Transfer Agent at 612-667-8833
or 800-338-1348. Investors may also contact their Norwest sales
representative to obtain information on the other classes. Sales
personnel of broker-dealers and other financial institutions selling
the Fund's shares may receive differing compensation for selling
I Shares, A Shares and B Shares of the Funds.<BR>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Bold">Shareholder Voting and Other
Rights. </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Each share
of each portfolio of the Trust and each class of shares has equal
dividend, distribution, liquidation and voting rights, and fractional
shares have those rights proportionately, except that expenses
related to the distribution of the shares of each class (and certain
other expenses such as transfer agency and administration expenses)
are borne solely by those shares and each class votes separately
with respect to the provisions of any Rule 12b-1 plan which pertain
to the class and other matters for which separate class voting
is appropriate under applicable law. Generally, shares will be
voted in the aggregate without reference to a particular portfolio
or class, except if the matter affects only one portfolio or class
or voting by portfolio or class is required by law, in which case
shares will be voted separately by portfolio or class, as appropriate.
Delaware law does not require the Trust to hold annual meetings
of shareholders, and it is anticipated that shareholder meetings
will be held only when specifically required by Federal or state
law. Shareholders have available certain procedures for the removal
of Trustees. There are no conversion or preemptive rights in connection
with shares of the Trust. All shares when issued in accordance
with the terms of the offering will be fully paid and nonassessable.
Shares are redeemable at net asset value, at the option of the
shareholders, subject to any contingent deferred sales charge
that may apply. A share-holder in a portfolio is entitled to the
shareholder's pro rata share of all dividends and distributions
arising from that portfolio's assets and, upon redeeming shares,
will receive the portion of the portfolio's net assets represented
by the redeemed shares.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">As an investor in International
Portfolio, International Fund will be entitled to vote in proportion
to its relative beneficial interest in International Portfolio.
On most issues subject to a vote of investors, as required by
the 1940 Act and other applicable law, the Fund will solicit proxies
from shareholders of the Fund and will vote its interest in International
Portfolio in proportion to the votes cast by its shareholders.
If there are other investors in International Portfolio, there
can be no assurance that any issue that receives a majority of
the votes cast by Fund shareholders will receive a majority of
votes cast by all investors in International Portfolio; indeed,
if other investors hold a majority interest in International Portfolio,
they could hold have voting control of International Portfolio.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">From time to time, a shareholder
may own a large percentage of a Fund. Accordingly, that shareholder
may be able to greatly affect (if not determine) the outcome of
a shareholder vote.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="FranklinGothic-Demi">CORE TRUST STRUCTURE</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">International Fund invests all
of its assets in International Portfolio, a separate series of
Core Trust, a business trust organized under the laws of the State
of Delaware in September 1994. Core Trust is registered under
the 1940 Act as an open-end management investment company. Pursuant
to an exemptive order issued by the SEC, the Blended Funds invest
portions of their assets in Small Company Portfolio, International
Portfolio II and Index Portfolio of Core Trust. Core Trust currently
consists of eight diversified portfolios. The assets of each Portfolio
of Core Trust belong only to, and the liabilities of each Portfolio
are borne solely by, the respective Portfolio and no other Portfolio
of Core Trust.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Bold">International Portfolio. </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">International
Fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing all
of its investable assets in International Portfolio, which has
the same investment objective and policies as the Fund. Accordingly,
International Portfolio directly acquires its own securities and
the Fund ac-quires an indirect interest in those securities. The
investment objective and fundamental investment policies of International
Fund and International Portfolio can be changed only with shareholder
approval. See &quot;Summary,&quot; &quot;Investment Objectives,
Policies and Risk Considerations,&quot; &quot;Management of the
Funds&quot; and &quot;Appendix A: Investments, Investment Strategies
and Risk Considerations&quot; for a complete description of International
Portfolio's investment objective, policies, restrictions, management,
and expenses.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">International Fund's investment
in International Portfolio is in the form of a non-transferable
beneficial interest. As of the date of this Prospectus, the Fund
is the only institutional investor that has invested all of its
assets in International Portfolio. International Portfolio may
permit other investment companies or institutional investors to
invest in International Portfolio. All investors in International
Portfolio will invest on the same terms and conditions as International
Fund and will pay a proportionate share of International Portfolio's
expenses.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">International Portfolio will not
sell its shares directly to members of the general public. Another
institutional investor in International Portfolio that might sell
its shares to members of the general public would not be required
to sell its shares at the same public offering price as International
Fund, could have different advisory and other fees and expenses
than International Fund, and might charge a sales commission.
Therefore, International Fund shareholders may have different
returns than shareholders in another investment company that invests
exclusively in International Portfolio. There is currently no
such other investment company that offers its shares to members
of the general public. Information regarding any such funds in
the future will be available from Core Trust by calling 207-879-1900.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Bold">Certain Risks of Investing in
International Portfolio. </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">International
Fund's investment in International Portfolio may be affected by
the actions of other large investors in International Portfolio,
if any. For example, if International Portfolio had a large investor
other than International Fund that redeemed its interest in International
Portfolio, International Portfolio's remaining investors (including
the Fund) might, as a result, experience higher pro rata operating
expenses, thereby producing lower returns.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">International Fund may withdraw
its entire investment from International Portfolio at any time,
if the Board determines that it is in the best interests of International
Fund and its shareholders to do so. International Fund might withdraw,
for example, if there were other investors in International Portfolio
with power to, and who did by a vote of the shareholders of all
investors (including the Fund), change the investment objective
or policies of International Portfolio in a manner not acceptable
to the Board. A withdrawal could result in a distribution in kind
of portfolio securities (as opposed to a cash distribution) by
International Portfolio. That distribution could result in a less
diversified portfolio of investments for the Fund and could affect
adversely the liquidity of the Fund's portfolio. If International
Fund decided to convert those securities to cash, it usually would
incur brokerage fees or other transaction costs. If International
Fund withdrew its investment from International Portfolio, the
Board would consider what action might be taken, including the
management of the Fund's assets in accordance with its investment
objective and policies by the Adviser and Schroder, the Fund's
investment adviser and subadviser, respectively, or the investment
of all of the Fund's investable assets in another pooled investment
entity having substantially the same investment objective as the
Fund. The inability of International Fund to find a suitable replacement
investment, in the event the Board decided not to permit the Adviser
and Schroder to manage the Fund's assets, could have a significant
impact on shareholders of the Fund.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Each investor in International
Portfolio, including International Fund, will be liable for all
obligations of International Portfolio but not for those of any
other portfolio of Core Trust. The risk to an investor in International
Portfolio of incurring financial loss on account of such liability,
however, would be limited to circumstances in which International
Portfolio was unable to meet its obligations. Upon liquidation
of International Portfolio, investors would be entitled to share
pro rata in the net assets of International Portfolio available
for distribution to investors.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Bold">Core Trust Blended Portfolios.
</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">The Blended Funds are
permitted to invest a portion of their assets which are managed
by using the small company, index and international investment
styles in Small Company Portfolio, Index Portfolio, and International
Portfolio II pursuant to an exemptive order obtained from the
SEC. The conditions of the Trust's exemptive order do not permit
a Fund to invest all of its assets in a Blended Portfolio. Accordingly,
Index Fund does not invest in Index Portfolio and International
Fund does not invest in International Portfolio II.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">The Trust's exemptive order imposes
several substantive conditions. On behalf of each Blended Fund,
the Board is required to review at least annually reports identifying
all instances in which a Portfolio in which the Fund invests buys
a security at approximately the same time that another Portfolio
in which the Fund invests sells the same security. The Board will
consider whether the duplication of brokerage costs resulting
from these transactions is significant. If the duplication of
brokerage costs becomes significant, the Board will adopt procedures
designed to limit duplication. Conservative Balanced Fund, Moderate
Balanced Fund, and Growth Balanced Fund will limit any redemptions
resulting from a reallocation in their respective equity and fixed
income security positions to no more than 1 percent of a Portfolio
during any period of less than 30 days. The Board will determine,
at least annually, that investment in the Portfolios is in the
best interests of the share-holders of each Blended Fund.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">As each Blended Portfolio comprises
investment components of several Blended Funds, a Blended Fund
may be affected by the actions of other Blended Funds with respect
to a particular Blended Portfolio. These risks are similar to
those associated with International Fund's investment in International
Portfolio, as described above. These risks include the possibility
that another Blended Fund might withdraw its investment from a
Blended Portfolio, leading to increased expenses for other Blended
Funds that invest in the Blended Portfolio, or that a Blended
Portfolio's investment policies might be changed in a manner not
suitable to a Blended Fund.<BR>

<LI>Interest rates declined during the first two months of the fourth quarter, with the yield on the five-year Treasury note dropping over 60 basis points.  Comments by Federal Reserve Board Chairman, Greenspan, and rumors of reduced foreign buying caused interest rates to move almost 40 basis points higher during December.
<LI>During the fourth quarter, we increased the Fund's asset-backed sector from 14% to 21%. We also increased our weighting in the corporate sector by 9%.  We decreased the mortgage-backed sector from 29% to 22% over the quarter, selling the last two collateralized mortgage obligations we held.
<LI>During the quarter, we lengthened the Fund's duration from 4.8 to 5.1 years.

<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="FranklinGothic-Demi">Common Stock and Preferred
Stock</FONT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Bold"> Equity Funds, Balanced
Funds, Total Return Bond Fund. </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Common
stockholders are the owners of the company issuing the stock and,
accordingly, vote on various corporate governance matters such
as mergers. They are not creditors of the company, but rather,
upon liquidation of the company are entitled to their pro rata
share of the company's assets after creditors (including fixed
income security holders) and, if applicable, preferred stockholders
are paid. Preferred stock is a class of stock having a preference
over common stock as to dividends and, in the alternative, as
to the recovery of investment. A preferred stockholder is a shareholder
in the company and not a creditor of the company as is a holder
of the company's fixed income securities. Dividends paid to common
and preferred stockholders are distributions of the earnings of
the company and not interest payments, which are expenses of the
company. Equity securities owned by a Fund may be traded on national
securities exchanges, in the over-the-counter market or on a regional
securities exchange and may not be traded every day or in the
volume typical of securities traded on a major national securities
exchange. As a result, disposition by a Fund of a portfolio security
to meet redemptions by shareholders or otherwise may require the
Fund to sell these securities at a discount from market prices,
to sell during periods when disposition is not desirable, or to
make many small sales over an extended period of time. The market
value of all securities, including equity securities, is based
upon the market's perception of value and not necessarily the
book value of an issuer or other objective measure of a company's
worth.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="FranklinGothic-Demi">Convertible Securities</FONT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Bold">
Equity Funds, Balanced Funds, Total Return Bond Fund. </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Convertible
securities, which include convertible debt, convertible preferred
stock and other securities exchangeable under certain circumstances
for shares of common stock, are fixed income securities or preferred
stock which generally may be converted at a stated price within
a specific amount of time into a specified number of shares of
common stock. A convertible security entitles the holder to receive
interest paid or accrued on debtor the dividend paid on preferred
stock until the convertible security matures or is redeemed, converted
or exchanged. Before conversion, convertible securities have characteristics
similar to nonconvertible debt securities in that they ordinarily
provide a stream of income with generally higher yields than those
of common stocks of the same or similar issuers. These securities
are usually senior to common stock in a company's capital structure,
but usually are subordinated to non-convertible debt securities.
In general, the value of a convertible security is the higher
of its investment value (its value as a fixed income security)
and its conversion value (the value of the underlying shares of
common stock if the security is converted). As a fixed income
security, the value of a convertible security generally increases
when interest rates decline and generally decreases when interest
rates rise. The value of a convertible security is, however, also
influenced by the value of the underlying common stock. Contrarian
Stock Fund and Small Company Stock Fund currently intend to limit
their investments in convertible securities, and the other Funds
may only invest in convertible securities, that are investment
grade.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">A Fund may invest in equity-linked
securities, including Preferred Equity Redemption Cumulative Stock
(&quot;PERCS&quot;), Equity-Linked Securities (&quot;ELKS&quot;),
and Liquid Yield Option Notes (&quot;LYONS&quot;). Equity-Linked
Securities are securities that are convertible into or based upon
the value of, equity securities upon certain terms and conditions.
The amount received by an investor at maturity of these securities
is not fixed but is based on the price of the underlying common
stock, which may rise or fall. In addition, it is not possible
to predict how equity-linked securities will trade in the secondary
market or whether the market for them will be liquid or illiquid.

<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="FranklinGothic-Demi">Warrants</FONT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Bold">
Equity Funds, Balanced Funds. </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">A
Fund may invest in warrants, which are options to purchase an
equity security at a specified price (usually representing a premium
over the applicable market value of the underlying equity security
at the time of the warrant's issuance) and usually during a specified
period of time. Unlike convertible securities and preferred stocks,
warrants do not pay a fixed dividend. Investments in warrants
involve certain risks, including the possible lack of a liquid
market for the resale of the warrants, potential price fluctuations
as a result of speculation or other factors and failure of the
price of the underlying security to reach a level at which the
warrant can be prudently exercised (in which case the warrant
may expire without being exercised, resulting in the loss of the
Fund's entire investment therein).<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="FranklinGothic-Demi">ADRs and EDRs</FONT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Bold">
Equity Funds (except Index Fund and Small Company Growth Fund),
Balanced Funds. </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">A Fund
may invest in sponsored and unsponsored American Depository Receipts
(&quot;ADRs&quot;), which are receipts issued by an American bank
or trust company evidencing ownership of underlying securities
issued by a foreign issuer. ADRs, in registered form, are designed
for use in U.S. securities markets. Unsponsored ADRs may be created
without the participation of the foreign issuer. Holders of these
ADRs generally bear all the costs of the ADR facility, whereas
foreign issuers typically bear certain costs in a sponsored ADR.
The bank or trust company depository of an unsponsored ADR may
be under no obligation to distribute shareholder communications
received from the foreign issuer or to pass through voting rights.
A Fund (other than Contrarian Stock Fund and Small Company Stock
Fund) may also invest in European Depository Receipts (&quot;EDRs&quot;),
receipts issued by a European financial institution evidencing
an arrangement similar to that of ADRs, and in other similar instruments
representing securities of foreign companies. EDRs, in bearer
form, are designed for use in European securities markets.<BR>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="FranklinGothic-Demi">U.S. Government Securities</FONT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Bold">
All Funds. </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">As used
in this Prospectus, the term U.S. Government Securities means
obligations issued or guaranteed as to principal and interest
by the U.S. Government, its agencies or instrumentalities. The
U.S. Government Securities in which a Fund may invest include
U.S. Treasury Securities and obligations issued or guaranteed
by U.S. Government agencies and instrumentalities and backed by
the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government, such as those
guaranteed by the Small Business Administration or issued by the
Government National Mortgage Association. In addition, the U.S.
Government Securities in which the Funds may invest include securities
supported primarily or solely by the creditworthiness of the issuer,
such as securities of the Federal National Mortgage Association,
the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation and the Tennessee Valley
Authority. There is no guarantee that the U.S. Government will
support securities not backed by its full faith and credit. Accordingly,
although these securities have historically involved little risk
of loss of principal if held to maturity, they may involve more
risk than securities backed by the U.S. Government's full faith
and credit.<BR>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="FranklinGothic-Demi">Zero-Coupon Securities</FONT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Bold">
Fixed Income Funds, Balanced Funds. </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">A
Fund may invest in separately traded principal and interest components
of securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. Treasury. These
components are traded independently under the Treasury's Separate
Trading of Registered Interest and Principal of Securities(&quot;STRIPS&quot;)
program or as Coupons Under Book Entry Safekeeping (&quot;CUBES&quot;).
The Funds may invest in other types of related zero-coupon securities.
For instance, a number of banks and brokerage firms separate the
principal and interest portions of U.S. Treasury securities and
sell them separately in the form of receipts or certificates representing
undivided interests in these instruments. These instruments are
generally held by a bank in a custodial or trust account on behalf
of the owners of the securities and are known by various names,
including Treasury Receipts (&quot;TRs&quot;), Treasury Investment
Growth Receipts (&quot;TIGRs&quot;) and Certificates of Accrual
on Treasury Securities (&quot;CATS&quot;). Zero-coupon securities
also may be issued by corporations and municipalities.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Zero-coupon securities are sold
at original issue discount and pay no interest to holders prior
to maturity, but a Fund holding a zero-coupon security must include
a portion of the original issue discount of the security as income.
Because of this, zero-coupon securities may be subject to greater
fluctuation of market value than the other securities in which
the Funds may invest. The Funds distribute all of their net investment
income, and may have to sell portfolio securities to distribute
imputed income, which may occur at a time when the Adviser or
Schroder would not have chosen to sell such securities and which
may result in a taxable gain or loss.<BR>

<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Bold">Corporate Debt Securities -
Balanced Funds, Fixed Income Funds, Contrarian Stock Fund, Small
Company Stock Fund. Commercial Paper - All Funds. </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">The
corporate debt securities in which the Funds may invest include
corporate bonds and notes and short-term investments such as commercial
paper and variable rate demand notes. Commercial paper (short-term
promissory notes) is issued by companies to finance their or their
affiliates' current obligations and is frequently unsecured. Variable
and floating rate demand notes are unsecured obligations redeemable
upon not more than 30 days' notice. These obligations include
master demand notes that permit investment of fluctuating amounts
at varying rates of interest pursuant to direct arrangement with
the issuer of the instrument. The issuer of these obligations
often has the right, after a given period, to prepay the outstanding
principal amount of the obligations upon a specified number of
days' notice. These obligations generally are not traded, nor
generally is there an established secondary market for these obligations.
To the extent a demand note does not have a 7 day or shorter demand
feature and there is no readily available market for the obligation,
it is treated as an illiquid security.<BR>

<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="FranklinGothic-Demi">Financial Institution
Obligations</FONT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Bold"> All Funds. </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">A
Fund may invest in obligations of financial institutions, including
negotiable certificates of deposit, bankers' acceptances and time
deposits of U.S. banks (including savings banks and savings associations),
foreign branches of U.S. banks, foreign banks and their non-U.S.
branches (Eurodollars), U.S. branches and agencies of foreign
banks (Yankee dollars), and wholly-owned banking-related subsidiaries
of foreign banks. Short Maturity style of Conservative Balanced
Fund limits these purchases to institutions which at the time
of investment have total assets in excess of 1 billion dollars,
or the equivalent in other currencies.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Certificates of deposit represent
an institution's obligation to repay funds deposited with it that
earn a specified interest rate over a given period. Bankers' acceptances
are negotiable obligations of a bank to pay a draft which has
been drawn by a customer and are usually backed by goods in international
trade. Time deposits are non-negotiable deposits with a banking
institution that earn a specified interest rate over a given period.
Certificates of deposit and fixed time deposits, which are payable
at the stated maturity date and bear a fixed rate of interest,
generally may be withdrawn on demand but maybe subject to early
withdrawal penalties which could reduce the Fund's yield. Deposits
subject to early withdrawal penalties or that mature in more than
7 days are treated as illiquid securities if there is no readily
available market for the securities. A Fund's investments in the
obligations of foreign banks and their branches, agencies or subsidiaries
may be obligations of the parent, of the issuing branch, agency
or subsidiary, or both. Investments in foreign bank obligations
are limited to banks and branches located in countries which the
Advisers believe do not present undue risk.<BR>

an adverse effect on the marketability of portfolio securities
and a Fund might also have to register restricted securities in
order to dispose of them, resulting in expense and delay. A Fund
might not be able to dispose of restricted or other securities
promptly or at reasonable prices and might thereby experience
difficulty satisfying redemptions. There can be no assurance that

ability to honor a demand for repayment of the unregistered security.
A securities contractual or legal restrictions on resale to the

for purchase by institutional buyers in accordance with Rule 144A
under the Securities Act of 1933 or other exemptions, the Advisers
may determine that such securities are not illiquid securities,
under guidelines or other exemptions adopted by the Board. These
guidelines take into account trading activity in the securities

All Funds. </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Each Fund
may borrow money for temporary or emergency purposes, including
the meeting of redemption requests, in amounts up to 33 1/3 percent
of the Fund's total assets. Borrowing involves special risk considerations.
Interest costs on borrowings may fluctuate with changing market
rates of interest and may partially offset or exceed the return
earned on borrowed funds (or on the assets that were retained
rather than sold to meet the needs for which funds were borrowed).
Under adverse market conditions, a Fund might have to sell portfolio
securities to meet interest or principal payments at a time when
investment considerations would not favor such sales. No Fund,
other than Managed Fixed Income Fund, Intermediate U.S. Government
Fund and, to the extent they invest in the Managed Fixed Income
Fund style or the Short Maturity style, the Balanced Funds may
purchase securities for investment while any borrowing equal to
5 percent or more of the Fund's total assets is outstanding or
borrow for purposes other than meeting redemptions in an amount
exceeding 5 per-cent of the value of the Fund's total assets.
A Fund's use of borrowed proceeds to make investments would subject
the Fund to the risks of leveraging. Reverse repurchase agreements,
short sales not against the box, dollar roll transactions and
other similar investments that involve a form of leverage have
characteristics similar to borrowings but are not considered borrowings
if the Fund maintains a segregated account; the use of these techniques
in connection with a segregated account may result in a Fund's

of leveraging involves special risks and may involve speculative
investment techniques. The Funds may borrow for other than temporary
or emergency purposes, lend their securities, enter reverse repurchase
agreements, and purchase securities on a when issued or forward
commitment basis. In addition, certain funds may engage in dollar
roll transactions and Intermediate U.S. Government Fund may purchase
securities on margin and sell securities short (other than against
the box). Each of these transactions involve the use of &quot;leverage&quot;
when cash made available to the Fund through the investment technique
is used to make additional portfolio investments. In addition,
the use of swap and related agreements may involve leverage. The
Funds use these investment techniques only when the Adviser to
a Fund believes that the leveraging and the returns available
to the Fund from investing the cash will provide shareholders
a potentially higher return.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Leverage exists when a Fund achieves
the right to a return on a capital base that exceeds the Fund's
investment. Leverage creates the risk of magnified capital losses
which occur when losses affect an asset base, enlarged by borrowings
or the creation of liabilities, that exceeds the equity base of
the Fund.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">The risks of leverage include
a higher volatility of the net asset value of the Fund's shares
and the relatively greater effect on the net asset value of the
shares caused by favorable or adverse market movements or changes
in the cost of cash obtained by leveraging and the yield obtained
from investing the cash. So long as a Fund is able to realize
a net return on its investment portfolio that is higher than interest
expense incurred, if any, leverage will result in higher current
net investment income being realized by the Fund than if the Fund
were not leveraged. On the other hand, interest rates change from
time to time as does their relationship to each other depending
upon such factors as supply and demand, monetary and tax policies
and investor expectations. Changes in such factors could cause
the relationship between the cost of leveraging and the yield
to change so that rates involved in the lever-aging arrangement
may substantially increase relative to the yield on the obligations
in which the proceeds of the leveraging have been invested. To
the extent that the interest expense involved in leveraging approaches
the net return on the Fund's investment portfolio, the benefit
of leveraging will be reduced, and, if the interest expense on
borrowings were to exceed the net return to shareholders, the
Fund's use of leverage would result in a lower rate of return
than if the Fund were not leveraged. Similarly, the effect of
leverage in a declining market could be a greater decrease in
net asset value per share than if the Fund were not leveraged.
In an extreme case, if the Fund's current investment income were
not sufficient to meet the interest expense of leveraging, it
could be necessary for the Fund to liquidate certain of its investments
at an inappropriate time. The use of leverage may be considered
speculative.<BR>

order to limit the risks involved in various transactions involving
leverage, the Trust's custodian will set aside and maintain in
a segregated account cash, U.S. Government Securities and other
liquid, high-grade debt securities in accordance with SEC guidelines.
The accounts value, which is marked to market daily, will be at
least equal to the Fund's commitments under these transactions.
The Fund's commitments may include (i) the Fund's obligations
to repurchase securities under a reverse repurchase agreement,
settle when-issued and forward commitment transactions and make
payments under a cap or floor (see &quot;Appendix A - Swap Agreements&quot;)
and (ii) the greater of the market value of securities sold short
or the value of the securities at the time of the short sale (reduced
by any margin deposit). The net amount of the excess, if any,
of a Fund's obligations over its entitlements with respect to
each interest rate swap will be calculated on a daily basis and
an amount at least equal to the accrued excess will be maintained

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">A Fund's use of repurchase agreements,
securities lending, reverse repurchase agreements and forward
commitments (including dollar roll transactions) entails certain
risks not associated with direct investments in securities. For
instance, in the event that bankruptcy or similar proceedings
were commenced against a counterparty while these transactions
remained open or a counterparty defaulted on its obligations,
the Fund might suffer a loss. Failure by the other party to deliver
a security purchased by the Fund may result in a missed opportunity
to make an alternative investment. The Advisers monitor the creditworthiness
of counterparties to these transactions and intend to enter into
these transactions only when they believe the counterparties present
minimal credit risks and the income to be earned from the transaction
justifies the attendant risks. Counterparty insolvency risk with
respect to repurchase agreements is reduced by favorable insolvency
laws that allow the Fund, among other things, to liquidate the
collateral held in the event of the bankruptcy of the counterparty.
Those laws do not apply to securities lending and, accordingly,
securities lending involves more risk than does the use of repurchase
agreements. As a result of entering forward commitments and reverse
repurchase agreements, as well as lending its securities, a Fund
may be exposed to greater potential fluctuations in the value
of its assets and net asset value per share. See &quot;Appendix

to repurchase that security from the buyer at an agreed upon price
on an agreed upon future date. The resale price in a reverse repurchase
agreement reflects a market rate of interest that is not related
to the coupon rate or maturity of the sold security. For certain
demand agreements, there is no agreed upon repurchase date and
interest payments are calculated daily, often based upon the prevailing
overnight repurchase rate. Because certain of the incidents of
ownership of the security are retained by the Fund, reverse repurchase
agreements may be viewed as a form of borrowing by the Fund from
the buyer, collateralized by the security sold by the Fund. A
Fund will use the proceeds of reverse</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">
</FONT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">repurchase agreements to
fund redemptions or to make investments. In most cases these investments
either mature or have a demand feature to resell to the issuer
on a date not later than the expiration of the agreement. Interest
costs on the money received in a reverse repurchase agreement
may exceed the return received on the investments made by the
Fund with those monies. Any significant commitment of a Fund's

<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Bold">When-Issued Securities and Forward
Commitments - All Funds. </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">A
Fund may purchase fixed income securities on a &quot;when-issued&quot;
or &quot;forward commitment&quot; basis. When these transactions
are negotiated, the price, which is generally expressed in yield
terms, is fixed at the time the commitment is made, but delivery
and payment for the securities take place at a later date. Normally,
the settlement date occurs within 3 months after the transaction.
During the period between a commitment and settlement, no payment
is made for the securities purchased and no interest on the security
accrues to the purchaser. At the time a Fund makes a commitment
to purchase securities in this manner, the Fund immediately assumes
the risk of ownership, including price fluctuation. Failure by
the other party to deliver a security purchased by a Fund may
result in a loss or a missed opportunity to make an alternative
investment.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">The use of when-issued transactions
and forward commitments enables a Fund to hedge against anticipated
changes in interest rates and prices. If the Adviser or Schroder
were to forecast incorrectly the direction of interest rate movements,
however, a Fund might be required to complete these transactions
when the value of the security is lower than the price paid by
the Fund. Except for dollar-roll transactions, a Fund will not
purchase securities on a when-issued or forward commitment basis
if, as a result, more than 15 percent (35 percent in the case
of Total Return Bond Fund) of the value of the Fund's total assets
would be committed to such transactions.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">When-issued securities and forward
commitments may be sold prior to the settlement date, but the
Funds purchase securities on a when-issued and forward commitment
basis only with the intention of actually receiving the securities.
When-issued securities may include bonds purchased on a &quot;when,
and if issued&quot; basis under which the issuance of the securities
depends upon the occurrence of a subsequent event. Commitment
of a Fund's assets to the purchase of securities on a when-issued
or forward commitment basis will tend to increase the volatility
of the Fund's net asset value per share.<BR>

<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Bold">Dollar Roll Transactions - Balanced
Funds, Fixed Income Funds (except Ready Cash Investment Fund).
</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">A Fund may enter into
dollar roll transactions wherein the Fund sells fixed income securities,
typically mortgage-backed securities, and makes a commitment to
purchase similar, but not identical, securities at a later date
from the same party. Like a forward commitment, during the roll
period no payment is made for the securities purchased and no
interest or principal payments on the security accrue to the purchaser,
but the Fund assumes the risk of ownership. A Fund is compensated
for entering into dollar roll transactions by the difference between
the current sales price and the forward price for the future purchase,
as well as by the interest earned on the cash proceeds of the
initial sale. Like other when-issued securities or firm commitment
agreements, dollar roll transactions involve the risk that the
market value of the securities sold by the Fund may decline below
the price at which a Fund is committed to purchase similar securities.
In the event the buyer of securities under a dollar roll transaction
becomes insolvent, the Fund's use of the proceeds of the transaction
may be restricted pending a determination by the other party,
or its trustee or receiver, whether to enforce the Fund's obligation
to repurchase the securities. The Funds will engage in roll transactions
for the purpose of acquiring securities for its portfolio and
not for investment leverage. Each Fund will limit its obligations
on dollar roll transactions to 35 percent of the Fund's net assets.

Balanced Funds, Intermediate U.S. Government Fund, Managed Fixed
Income Fund, Stable Income Fund. </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">To
manage its exposure to different types of investments, a Fund
may enter into interest rate, currency and mortgage (or other
asset) swap agreements and may purchase and sell interest rate
&quot;caps,&quot; &quot;floors&quot; and &quot;collars.&quot;
In a typical interest rate swap agreement, one party agrees to
make regular payments equal to a floating interest rate on a specified
amount (the &quot;notional principal</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">
</FONT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">amount&quot;) in return
for payments equal to a fixed interest rate on the same amount
for a specified period. If a swap agreement provides for payment
in different currencies, the parties may also agree to exchange
the notional principal amount. Mortgage swap agreements are similar
to interest rate swap agreements, except that the notional principal
amount is tied to a reference pool of mortgages. In a cap or floor,
one party agrees, usually in return for a fee, to make payments
under particular circumstances. For example, the purchaser of
an interest rate cap has the right to receive payments to the
extent a specified interest rate exceeds an agreed upon level;
the purchaser of an interest rate floor has the right to receive
payments to the extent a specified interest rate falls below an
agreed upon level. A collar entitles the purchaser to receive
payments to the extent a specified interest rate falls outside
an agreed upon range.<BR>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Swap agreements may involve leverage
and may be highly volatile; depending on how they are used, they
may have a considerable impact on the Fund's performance. See
&quot;Appendix A - Techniques Involving Leverage.&quot; Swap agreements
involve risks depending upon the counterparties creditworthiness
and ability to perform as well as the Fund's ability to terminate
its swap agreements or reduce its exposure through offsetting
transactions. The Adviser monitors the creditworthiness of counterparties

to make short sales of securities it owns or has the right to
acquire at no added cost through conversion or exchange of other
securities it owns(referred to as short sales &quot;against the
box&quot;) and to make short sales of securities which it does
not own or have the right to acquire. A short sale that is not
made &quot;against the box&quot; is a transaction in which a Fund
sells a security it does not own in anticipation of a decline
in the market price for the security. When the Fund makes a short
sale, the proceeds it receives are retained by the broker until
the Fund replaces the borrowed security. In order to deliver the
security to the buyer, the Fund must arrange through a broker
to borrow the security and, in so doing, the Fund becomes obligated
to replace the security borrowed at its market price at the time
of replacement, whatever that price may be.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Short sales that are not made
&quot;against the box&quot; create opportunities to increase the
Fund's return but, at the same time, involve special risk considerations
and may be considered a speculative technique. Since the Fund
in effect profits from a decline in the price of the securities
sold short without the need to invest the full purchase price
of the securities on the date of the short sale, the Fund's net
asset value per share, will tend to increase more when the securities
it has sold short decrease in value, and to decrease more when
the securities it has sold short increase in value, than would
otherwise be the case if it had not engaged in such short sales.
Short sales theoretically involve unlimited loss potential, as
the market price of securities sold short may continuously increase,
although a Fund may mitigate such losses by replacing the securities
sold short before the market price has increased significantly.
Under adverse market conditions a Fund might have difficulty purchasing
securities to meet its short sale delivery obligations and might
have to sell portfolio securities to raise the capital necessary
to meet its short sale obligations at a time when fundamental
investment considerations would not favor those sales. See &quot;Appendix
A - Techniques Involving Leverage.&quot;<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">If the Fund makes a short sale
&quot;against the box&quot;, the Fund would not immediately deliver
the securities sold and would not receive the proceeds from the
sale. The seller is said to have a short position in the securities
sold until it delivers the securities sold, at which time it receives
the proceeds of the sale. The Fund's decision to make a short
sale &quot;against the box&quot; may be a technique to hedge against
market risks when the Adviser believes that the price of a security
may decline, causing a decline in the value of a security owned
by the Fund or a security convertible into or exchangeable for
such security. In such case, any future losses in the Fund's long
position would be reduced by an offsetting future gain in the
short position. The Fund's ability to enter into short sales transactions
is limited by certain tax requirements. See &quot;Dividends, Distributions

mortgage-backed securities provide monthly payments which consist

are a &quot;pass-through&quot; of the monthly payments made by
the individual borrowers on their mortgage loans, net of any fees
paid to the issuer or guarantor of the securities or a mortgage

but may vary among pools. For example, in addition to fixed-rate,

liquid. The recently introduced private conventional pools of
mortgages(pooled by commercial banks, savings and loan institutions
and others, with no relationship with government and government-related

<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Bold">Average Life and Prepayments.
</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">The average life of
a pass-through pool varies with the maturities of the underlying
mortgage instruments. In addition, a pool's terms may be shortened
by unscheduled or early payments of principal and interest on
the underlying mortgages. Prepayments with respect to securities
during times of declining interest rates will tend to lower the
return of a Fund and may even result in losses to a Fund if the
securities were acquired at a premium. The occurrence of mortgage
prepayments is affected by various factors including the level
of interest rates, general economic conditions, the location and
age of the mortgage and other social and demographic conditions.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">As prepayment rates of individual
pools vary widely, it is not possible to accurately predict the
average life of a particular pool. For pools of fixed-rate 30-year
mortgages, common industry practice is to assume that prepayments
will result in a 12-year average life. Pools of mortgages with
other maturities or different characteristics will have varying
assumptions for average life. The assumed average life of pools
of mortgages having terms of less than 30 years is less than 12
years, but typically not less than5 years.<BR>

<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Bold">Yield Calculations. </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Yields
on pass-through securities are typically quoted by investment
dealers based on the maturity of the underlying instruments and
the associated average life assumption. In periods of falling
interest rates, the rate of prepayment tends to increase, thereby
shortening the actual average life of a pool of mortgages. Conversely,
in periods of rising rates, the rate of prepayment tends to decrease,
thereby lengthening the actual average life of the pool. Actual
prepayment experience may cause the yield to differ from the assumed
average life yield. Reinvestment of prepayments may occur at higher
or lower interest rates than the original investment, thus affecting

Participation Certificates (&quot;PCs&quot;) which represent interests
in mortgages from FHLMC's national portfolio. FNMA and FHLMC each
guarantee the payment of principal and interest on the securities
they issue. These securities, however, are not backed by the full
faith and credit of the United States Government.<BR>

<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Bold">Privately Issued Mortgage-Backed
Securities. </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Mortgage-backed
securities offered by private issuers include pass-through securities
comprised of pools of conventional mortgage loans; mortgage-backed
bonds which are considered to be debt obligations of the institution
issuing the bonds and which are collateralized by mortgage loans;
and collateralized mortgage obligations.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Mortgage-backed securities issued
by non-governmental issuers may offer a higher rate of interest
than securities issued by government issuers because of the absence
of direct or indirect government guarantees of payment. Many non-governmental
issuers or servicers of mortgage-backed securities, however, guarantee
timely payment of interest and principal on such securities. Timely
payment of interest and principal may also be supported by various
forms of insurance, including individual loan, title, pool and
hazard policies. There can be no assurance that the private issuers
or insurers will be able to meet their obligations under the relevant
guarantees and insurance policies.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Bold">Adjustable Rate Mortgage-Backed
Securities. </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Adjustable
rate mortgage-backed securities (&quot;ARMs&quot;) are securities
that have interest rates that are reset at periodic intervals,
usually by reference to some interest rate index or market interest
rate. Although the rate adjustment feature may act as a buffer
to reduce sharp changes in the value of adjustable rate securities,
these securities are still subject to changes in value based on
changes in market interest rates or changes in the issuer's creditworthiness.
Because of the resetting of interest rates, adjustable rate securities
are less likely than non-adjustable rate securities of comparable
quality and maturity to increase significantly in value when market
interest rates fall. Also, most adjustable rate securities (or
the underlying mortgages) are subject to caps or floors. &quot;Caps&quot;
limit the maximum amount by which the interest rate paid by the
borrower may change at each reset date or over the life of the
loan and, accordingly, fluctuation in interest rates above these
levels could cause such mortgage securities to &quot;cap out&quot;
and to behave more like long-term, fixed-rate debt securities.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">ARMs may have less risk of a decline
in value during periods of rapidly rising rates, but they may
also have less potential for capital appreciation than other debt
securities of comparable maturities due to the periodic adjustment
of the interest rate on the underlying mortgages and due to the
likelihood of increased prepayments of mortgages as interest rates
decline. Furthermore, during periods of declining interest rates,
income to a Fund will decrease as the coupon rate resets to reflect
the decline in interest rates. During periods of rising interest
rates, changes in the coupon rates of the mortgages underlying
a Fund's ARMs may lag behind changes in market interest rates.
This may result in a slightly lower net value until the interest
rate resets to market rates. Thus, investors could suffer some
principal loss if they sold Fund Shares before the interest rates
on the underlying mortgages were adjusted to reflect current market
rates.<BR>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Bold">Collateralized Mortgage Obligations.
</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Collateralized Mortgage
Obligations (&quot;CMOs&quot;) are debt obligations that are collateralized
by mortgages or mortgage pass-through securities issued by GNMA,</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">
</FONT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">FHLMC or FNMA or by pools
of conventional mortgages (&quot;Mortgage Assets&quot;). CMOs
may be privately issued or U.S. Government Securities. Payments
of principal and interest on the Mortgage Assets are passed through
to the holders of the CMOs on the same schedule as they are received,
although, certain classes (often referred to as tranches) of CMOs
have priority over other classes with respect to the receipt of
payments. Multi-class mortgage pass-through securities are interests
in trusts that hold Mortgage Assets and that have multiple classes
similar to those of CMOs. Unless the context indicates otherwise,
references to CMOs include multi-class mortgage pass-through securities.
Payments of principal of and interest on the underlying Mortgage
Assets (and in the case of CMOs, any reinvestment income thereon)
provide funds to pay debt service on the CMOs or to make scheduled
distributions on the multi-class mortgage pass-through securities.
Parallel pay CMOs are structured to provide payments of principal
on each payment date to more than one class. These simultaneous
payments are taken into account in calculating the stated maturity
date or final distribution date of each class, which, as with
other CMO structures, must be retired by its stated maturity date
or final distribution date but may be retired earlier. Planned
amortization class mortgage-based securities(&quot;PAC Bonds&quot;)
are a form of parallel pay CMO. PAC Bonds are designed to provide
relatively predictable payments of principal provided that, among
other things, the actual prepayment experience on the underlying
mortgage loans falls within a contemplated range. If the actual
prepayment experience on the underlying mortgage loans is at a
rate faster or slower than the contemplated range, or if deviations
from other assumptions occur, principal payments on a PAC Bond
may be greater or smaller than predicted. The magnitude of the
contemplated range varies from one PAC Bond to another; a narrower
range increases the risk that prepayments will be greater or smaller
than contemplated. CMOs may have complicated structures and generally
involve more risks than simpler forms of mortgage- backed securities.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">The final tranche of a CMO may
be structured as an accrual bond (sometimes referred to as a Z-tranche).
Holders of accrual bonds receive no cash payments for an extended
period of time. During the time that earlier tranches are outstanding,
accrual bonds receive accrued interest which is a credit for periodic
interest payments that increases the face amount of the security
at a compounded rate, but is not paid to the bond holder. After
all previous tranches are retired, accrual bond holders start
receiving cash payments that include both principal and continuing
interest. The market value of accrual bonds can fluctuate widely
and their average life depends on the other aspects of the CMO
offering. Interest on accrual bonds is taxable when accrued even
though the holders receive no accrual payment. The Funds distribute
all of their net investment income, and may have to sell portfolio
securities to distribute imputed income, which may occur at a
time when the Adviser would not have chosen to sell such securities
and which may result in a taxable gain or loss.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Bold">Stripped Mortgage-Backed Securities.
</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Stripped mortgage-backed
securities are classes of mortgage-backed securities that receive
different proportions of the interest and principal distributions
from the underlying Mortgage Assets. They may be may be privately
issued or U.S. Government Securities. In the most extreme case,
one class will be entitled to receive all or a portion of the
interest but none of the principal from the Mortgage Assets (the
interest-only or &quot;IO&quot; class) and one class will be entitled
to receive all or a portion of the principal, but none of the
interest (the &quot;PO&quot; class). Currently, no fund may purchase
IOs or POs.<BR>

Fund. </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Asset-backed
securities represent direct or indirect participations in, or
are secured by and payable from, assets other than mortgage-backed
assets such as motor vehicle installment sales contracts, installment
loan contracts, leases of various types of real and personal property
and receivables from revolving credit (credit card) agreements.
No Fund may invest more than 10 percent of its net assets in asset-backed
securities that are backed by a particular type of credit, for
instance, credit card receivables. Asset-backed securities, including
adjustable rate asset-backed securities, have yield characteristics
similar to those of mortgage-backed securities and, accordingly,
are subject to many of the same risks.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Assets are securitized through
the use of trusts and special purpose corporations that issue
securities that are often backed by a pool of assets representing
the obligations of a number of different parties. Payments of
principal and interest may be guaranteed up to certain amounts
and for a certain time period by a letter of credit issued by
a financial institution. Asset-backed securities do not always
have the benefit of a security interest in collateral comparable
to the security interests associated with mortgage-backed securities.
As a result, the risk that recovery on repossessed collateral
might be unavailable or inadequate to support payments on asset-backed
securities is greater for asset-backed securities than for mortgage-backed
securities. In addition, because asset-backed securities are relatively
new, the market experience in these securities is limited and
the market's ability to sustain liquidity through all phases of
an interest rate or economic cycle has not been tested.<BR>

Fixed Income Fund. </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Changes
in foreign currency exchange rates will affect the U.S. dollar
values of securities denominated in currencies other than the
U.S. dollar. The rate of exchange between the U.S. dollar and
other currencies fluctuates in response to forces of supply and
demand in the foreign exchange markets. These forces are affected
by the international balance of payments and other economic and
financial conditions, government intervention, speculation and
other factors. When investing in foreign securities a Fund usually
effects currency exchange transactions on a spot(i.e., cash) basis
at the spot rate prevailing in the foreign exchange market. The
Fund incurs foreign exchange expenses in converting assets from
one currency to another.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">A Fund may enter into foreign
currency forward contracts or currency futures or options contracts
for the purchase or sale of foreign currency to &quot;lock in&quot;
the U.S. dollar price of the securities denominated in a foreign
currency or the U.S. dollar value of interest and dividends to
be paid on such securities, or to hedge against the possibility
that the currency of a foreign country in which a Fund has investments
may suffer a decline against the U.S. dollar. The Funds have no
present intention to enter into currency futures or options contracts
but may do so in the future. A forward currency contract is an
obligation to purchase or sell a specific currency at a future
date, which may be any fixed number of days from the date of the
contract agreed upon by the parties, at a price set at the time
of the contract. This method of attempting to hedge the value
of a Fund's portfolio securities against a decline in the value
of a currency does not eliminate fluctuations in the underlying
prices of the securities. Although the strategy of engaging in
foreign currency transactions could reduce the risk of loss due
to a decline in the value of the hedged currency, it could also
limit the potential gain from an increase in the value of the
currency. The Funds do not intend to maintain a net exposure to
such contracts where the fulfillment of the Fund's obligations
under such contracts would obligate the Fund to deliver an amount
of foreign currency in excess of the value of the Fund's portfolio
securities or other assets denominated in that currency. A Fund
will not enter into these contracts for speculative purposes and
will not enter into non-hedging currency contracts. These contracts
involve a risk of loss if the Adviser fails to predict currency
values correctly.</FONT>

Fund may seek to enhance its return through the writing (selling)
and purchasing of exchange-traded and over-the-counter options
on fixed income securities or indices. A Fund may also to attempt
to hedge against a decline in the value of securities owned by
it or an increase in the price of securities which it plans to
purchase through the use of those options and the purchase and
sale of interest rate futures contracts and options on those futures
contracts. A Fund may only write options that are covered. An
option is covered if, so long as the Fund is obligated under the
option, it owns an offsetting position in the underlying security
or futures contract or maintains cash, U.S. Government Securities
or other liquid, high-grade debt securities in a segregated account
with a value at all times sufficient to cover the Fund's obligation
under the option. Certain futures strategies employed by a Balanced
Fund in making temporary allocations may not be deemed to be for
bona fide hedging purposes, as defined by the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission. A Fund may enter into</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">

only if the aggregate of initial margin deposits for open futures
contract positions does not exceed 5 percent of the Fund's total
assets.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Bold">Risk Considerations. </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">The
Fund's use of options and futures contracts subjects the Fund
to certain investment risks and transaction costs to which it
might not otherwise be subject. These risks include: (1) dependence
on the Adviser's ability to predict movements in the prices of
individual securities and fluctuations in the general securities
markets; (2) imperfect correlations between movements in the prices
of options or futures contracts and movements in the price of
the securities hedged or used for cover which may cause a given
hedge not to achieve its objective; (3) the fact that the skills
and techniques needed to trade these instruments are different
from those needed to select the other securities in which the
Fund invests; (4) lack of assurance that a liquid secondary market
will exist for any particular instrument at any particular time,
which, among other things, may hinder a Fund's ability to limit
exposures by closing its positions; (5) the possible need to defer
closing out of certain options, futures contracts and related
options to avoid adverse tax consequences; and (6) the potential
for unlimited loss when investing in futures contracts or writing
options for which an offsetting position is not held.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Other risks include the inability
of the Fund, as the writer of covered call options, to benefit
from any appreciation of the underlying securities above the exercise
price and the possible loss of the entire premium paid for options
purchased by the Fund. In addition, the futures exchanges may
limit the amount of fluctuation permitted in certain futures contract
prices during a single trading day. A Fund may be forced, therefore,
to liquidate or close out a futures contract position at a disadvantageous
price.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">There can be no assurance that
a liquid market will exist at a time when a Fund seeks to close
out a futures position or that a counterparty in an over-the-counter
option transaction will be able to per-form its obligations. There
are a limited number of options on interest rate futures contracts
and exchange traded options contracts on fixed income securities.
Accordingly, hedging transactions involving these instruments
may entail &quot;cross-hedging.&quot; As an example, a Fund may
wish to hedge existing holdings of mortgage-backed securities,
but no listed options may exist on those securities. In that event,
the Adviser may attempt to hedge the Fund's securities by the
use of options with respect to similar fixed income securities.
The Fund may use various futures contracts that are relatively
new instruments without a significant trading history. As a result,
there can be no assurance that an active secondary market in those
contracts will develop or continue to exist.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Bold">Limitations. </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Except
for the futures contracts strategies of the Balanced Funds used
for making temporary allocations among fixed-income and equity
securities, the Funds have no current intention of investing in
futures contracts and options thereon for purposes other than
hedging. No Fund may purchase any call or put option on a futures
contract if the premiums associated with all such options held
by the Fund would exceed 5 percent of the Fund's total assets
as of the date the option is purchased. No Fund may sell a put
option if the exercise value of all put options written by the
Fund would exceed 50 percent of the Fund's total assets or sell
a call option if the exercise value of all call options written
by the Fund would exceed the value of the Fund's assets. In addition,
the current market value of all open futures positions held by
a Fund will not exceed 50 percent of its total assets.<BR>

<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Bold">Options on Securities. </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">A
call option is a contract pursuant to which the purchaser of the
call option, in return for a premium paid, has the right to buy
the security underlying the option at a specified exercise price
at any time during the term of the option. The writer of the call
option, who receives the premium, has the obligation upon exercise
of the option to deliver the underlying security against payment
of the exercise price during the option period. A put option gives
its purchaser, in return for a premium, the right to sell the
underlying security at a specified price during the term of the
option. The writer of the put, who receives the premium, has the
obligation to buy the underlying security, upon exercise at the
exercise price during the option period. The amount of premium
received or paid is based upon certain factors, including the
market price of the underlying security or index, the relationship
of the exercise price to the market price, the historical price
volatility of the underlying security or index, the option period,
supply and demand and interest rates.<BR>

<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Bold">Options on Stock Indices. </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">A
stock index assigns relative values to the stock included in the

exercises of stock index options are effected with cash payments
and do not involve delivery of securities. Thus, upon exercise
of stock index options, the purchaser will realize and the writer

<LI>During December, short Treasury notes traded more attractively relative to Treasury bills.  The maturity of December cash management bills forced additional money into the market.  This increased the demand for 6-month and 1-year Treasury bills as investors attempted to reinvest the proceeds from cash management bills, thus lowering their yield and making them less attractive.

<UL>
<LI>Following a three-month rally, interest rates rose steadily during December.  Inflation fears were rekindled when a lower than expected trade deficit, coupled with consumer spending that exceeded expectations, led to an upward revision in fourth quarter GDP.
<LI>During the month, we purchased a Guaranteed Investment Contract (GIC) and three GIC Alternatives at attractive valuation levels into the Fund.
<LI>The Fund retains its high credit quality (AA+) and is currently targeting an average maturity of 2.6 years.
<LI>The Fund's liquidity position remains strong with 14.6% of its assets invested in money market instruments.  During the next 3 months, we will reduce this position by placing intermediate maturity GIC alternatives with high quality issuers

<LI>The Fund performed well during 1996, in line with its benchmark.  During December, however, the Fund's performance lagged its benchmark's by 5 basis points.
<LI>Using cash proceeds, we purchased a LIBOR-based (London Inter-Bank Offered Rate) floating rate note into the Fund during December.  With yield spreads tightening across all market sectors, we are continuing to focus on purchasing securities which represent the best relative values.
<LI>With a targeted duration of 1 year, the Fund continues to provide a yield that is higher than its benchmark's.  The Fund's credit quality remains excellent, averaging 'AAA'.

</H4>
<UL>
<LI>The Fund participated in the strong stock market performance of the fourth quarter and the year.  Its return ranked it near the top third of its Lipper peers for 1996, with a return that was 1.4% higher than that of the average fund in the Equity Income Funds group.
<LI>The best performing sectors for the Fund during the fourth quarter were consumer staples, energy and finance.  Leading the way for consumer staples were the tobacco stocks that advanced on an improving environment regarding political litigation.  The energy group benefited from higher oil and gas prices, while our finance stocks fared well upon anticipation of stronger-than-expected fourth quarter earnings.
<LI>The Fund's fourth quarter performance trailed that of the S&amp;P 500 Index.  The major culprits were the Fund's consumer cyclicals, technology and health care stocks.  Retailers, who count on the holiday shopping season for most of their annual sales, reported only mediocre sales increases over 1995.  Even though we believe that our technology and health care stocks have promising long-term prospects, they produced modest returns during the quarter because of short-term concerns.
<LI>The fundamentals of the Fund continue to compare very favorably with the market indicating positive prospects going forward.  In addition, its long-term performance continues to be very competitive.

The performance for the Fund includes the performance of the predecessor collective investment fund for periods before it became a mutual fund on November 11, 1994. The collective investment fund performance was adjusted to reflect the Fund's 1994 estimate of its expense ratio for the first year of operations as a mutual fund. The collective investment fund was not registered under the 1940 Act or subject to certain investment restrictions that are imposed by the Act. If the collective investment fund had been registered under the 1940 Act, the collective investment fund historical return may have been adversely affected.

The performance for the Fund includes the performance of the predecessor collective investment fund for periods before it became a mutual fund on November 11, 1994. The collective investment fund performance was adjusted to reflect the Fund's 1994 estimate of its expense ratio for the first year of operations as a mutual fund. The collective investment fund was not registered under the 1940 Act or subject to certain investment restrictions that are imposed by the Act. If the collective investment fund had been registered under the 1940 Act, the collective investment fund historical return may have been adversely affected.

<UL>
<LI>The government money market yield curve (yields on securities with maturities of up to 1 year) flattened during the fourth quarter -- yields on 3 and 6-month Treasury bills rose, while the yield on 1-year bills declined by 20 basis points.
<LI>During the quarter, short agency paper continued to be attractively valued versus Treasury bills, offering a yield pick up in excess of 20 basis points.
<LI>Overnight government repurchase rates were relatively high during December, trading near the Federal Funds rate.  This was particularly so on the last day of the year, when year-end borrowing pressures forced overnight repurchase rates above 7%.
<LI>During the quarter, we shortened the Fund's average maturity and built liquidity because we often experience redemptions during December.  This did not negatively impact the Fund's yield, however, because repurchase rates were as high as they were.

<UL>
<LI>The Fund performed very well during 1996 -- it ranked in the top 40% of its Lipper Balanced Funds peer group with a return that was 0.49% higher than that of the average fund in the category.
<LI>The diversified equity portfolio was up 20.43%, placing it near the top half of its Lipper peers for the year and ahead of its benchmark by 69 basis points.  The diversified bond portfolio also performed very well.  Its annual return of 3.44% placed it near the top third of its Lipper peer group of 176 Intermediate Investment Grade Debt Funds.
<LI>The S&amp;P 500 Index of large company stocks posted an 8.34% advance during the fourth quarter and an annual return of 22.96%.  The economic environment of steady growth and low inflation, coupled with strong corporate earnings, helped fuel the stock market rally.
<LI>Bond prices were volatile all year long and reacted swiftly to changes in economic news, particularly on inflation.  Bond yields rose during the year -- the 30-year Treasury bond, which yielded 5.95% at the beginning of 1996, traded in a 125 basis point range during the year to end at 6.65%.

<B><I>Information presented is for the Fund's I Shares. The yield provided is for the 30 days through the end of the above period.  Average annual total returns were 14.25%, 12.07%, 10.45% and 12.11%  for 1, 3, 5 year and since inception (4/30/89) periods,respectively, for the period ended 12/31/96. </I></B></I>

<B><I>These returns include reinvestment of dividends and capital gains. During this period, some of the Fund's fees may have been waived; if these fees were not waived, total return would have been lower.

<P><I>
<B><I>Prior to November 11, 1994, Norwest Bank Minnesota, N.A. managed a collective trust fund with investment objectives and policies substantially the same as those of the Fund. The performance for the Fund includes the performance of the predecessor collective investment fund for periods before it became a mutual fund on November 11, 1994. The collective investment fund performance was adjusted to reflect the Fund's 1994 estimate of its expense ratio for the first year of operations as a mutual fund. The collective investment fund was not registered under the 1940 Act or subject to certain investment restrictions that are imposed by the Act. If the collective investment fund had been registered under the 1940 Act, the collective investment fund historical return may have been adversely affected.</I></B></I>

<B>Performance Highlights</B>
</H4>
<UL>
<LI>The Fund underperformed the S&amp;P 500 Index during the fourth quarter despite a strong finish in December.  During most of the fourth quarter, the stock market continued to be supported by enthusiastic investors who focused on the market's positive fundamental background.  Stock prices ended a strong year on an anticlimactic note in December, however, due to a decline in bonds and some bearish comments by Federal Reserve Bank Chairman, Alan Greenspan.
<LI>This uncertainty about the magnitude of economic growth hurt certain sectors of the Fund, which is heavily weighted in cyclical stocks.  The Fund's retail stocks, including Wal-Mart, the Limited and Dillard Department Stores, were hit hardest as investors pondered whether heavy debt burdens will slow consumer spending in 1997.  The Fund's basic industry stocks (steel, aluminum, chemical, paper) were negatively impacted this quarter as investors contemplated economically sensitive demand levels for 1997.
<LI>Still trading at extremely low valuation levels, the Fund's stocks should outperform in the coming months as investors, with renewed confidence in the economy, again start buying economically sensitive stocks.
<LI>During December, we eliminated our position in AAR Corporation, as this stock reached its predetermined sell price.  We did not add any new names to the Fund during the month.

<UL>
<LI>The Fund performed very well during 1996, outpacing the average fund in its Lipper Growth Funds group by a substantial margin and ranking in the top half of this peer group.
<LI>The Fund's best performing stocks during December included Thermo Electron (which was added to the S&amp;P 500 Index), ADT (which received a hostile takeover offer), Xerox, SunAmerica and York International.  The laggards were  Black and Decker, Cabletron, Lowe's, EDS and American Home Products.
<LI>We added Federal National Mortgage Association (a government-sponsored entity that provides liquidity to mortgage lenders) to the portfolio during December, while no names were eliminated.
<LI>We anticipate that 1997 will be more of a "stock-picker's" market.  We believe that the high quality growth companies which we own in the Fund will perform well in the slow growth economy and challenging market environment that we anticipate.

<UL>
<LI>The Fund's diversified structure enabled it to perform well in last year's volatile fixed income market with a return that placed it near the top third of its Lipper peer group of 176 Intermediate Investment Grade Debt Funds for the year.
<LI>Bond prices were volatile and reacted swiftly to changes in economic news, particularly on inflation.  Concerns that foreign demand for Treasury bonds was drying up also negatively impacted bond prices during the fourth quarter.
<LI>Bond yields rose during the year -- the 30-year Treasury bond, which yielded 5.95% at the beginning of 1996, traded in a 125 basis point range during the year to end at 6.65%.  Intermediate maturity bonds also traded in a similar fashion through the year.  Total returns for bonds of all maturities, however, were modestly positive.

Results represent past performance and do not guarantee future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate, and shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than original cost.Prior to November 11, 1994, Norwest Bank Minnesota, N.A. managed a collective trust fund with investment objectives and policies substantially the same as those of the Fund. The performance for the Fund includes the performance of the predecessor collective investment fund for periods before it became a mutual fund on November 11, 1994. The collective investment fund performance was adjusted to reflect the Fund's 1994 estimate of its expense ratio for the first year of operations as a mutual fund. The collective investment fund was not registered under the 1940 Act or subject to certain investment restrictions that are imposed by the Act. If the collective investment fund had been registered under the 1940 Act, the collective investment fund historical return may have been adversely affected.

<B>Performance Highlights</B>
</H4>
<UL>
<LI>Long-term interest rates declined steadily during the first two months of the fourth quarter from 6.92% to 6.36% before reversing this trend in December, ending the year at 6.64%.  Comments by Federal Reserve Board Chairman, Greenspan, and rumors of reduced foreign buying caused interest rates to move higher during December.
<LI>Even though the Fund's shorter-than-benchmark strategy benefited from rising rates in December, the cumulative underperformance for the quarter still reflected the general decline in rates since September 30.  The Fund's management strategy has worked well for the year, however, with the Fund ranking in the top half of its Lipper peers.
<LI>As the bond market rallied early in the fourth quarter, we shortened the duration of the Fund slightly.  At this point in the business cycle, the Fund is still focused on protecting principal with a duration strategy that is shorter than its benchmark.

<LI>The diversified bond portfolio performed very well during the year.  Its annual return of 3.44% placed it near the top third of its Lipper peer group of 176 Intermediate Investment Grade Debt Funds.  The stable income style gained 5.46% during the year.
<LI>Bond prices were volatile all year long and reacted swiftly to changes in economic news, particularly on inflation.  Bond yields rose during the year -- the 30-year Treasury bond, which yielded 5.95% at the beginning of 1996, traded in a 125 basis point range during the year to end at 6.65%.
<LI>The diversified equity portfolio was up 20.43%, placing it near the top half of its Lipper peers for the year and ahead of its benchmark by 69 basis points.
<LI>The S&amp;P 500 Index of large company stocks posted an 8.34% advance during the fourth quarter and an annual return of 22.96%.  The economic environment of steady growth and low inflation, coupled with strong corporate earnings, helped fuel the stock market rally.

<B><I>Prior to November 11, 1994, Norwest Bank Minnesota, N.A. managed a collective trust fund with investment objectives and policies substantially the same as those of the Fund. The performance for the Fund includes the performance of the predecessor collective investment fund for periods before it became a mutual fund on November 11, 1994. The collective investment fund performance was adjusted to reflect the Fund's 1994 estimate of its expense ratio for the first year of operations as a mutual fund. The collective investment fund was not registered under the 1940 Act or subject to certain investment restrictions that are imposed by the Act. If the collective investment fund had been registered under the 1940 Act, the collective investment fund historical return may have been adversely affected.</I></B></I>

<B>Performance Highlights</B>
</H4>
<UL>
<LI>The Fund had a very successful fourth quarter and year, beating its benchmark and ranking in the top quartile of its Lipper Small Company Growth Funds peer group during both periods.
<LI>During 1996, small company stocks underperformed large company stocks for the second year in a row.  In general, small value stocks outperformed small growth stocks.  The only groups which outperformed the Russell 2000 Index during the year were energy and financial services.  The worst performing sectors were consumer staples, utilities and health care.
<LI>The Fund is currently overweighted in the consumer staples, energy and technology sectors.  There is also a heavy weighting in financial services stocks.  Financial services and energy continue to be core areas in the Fund.
<LI>We are optimistic about the performance of small company stocks during 1997.  Low inflation, promising earnings growth prospects and reasonable valuation levels (relative to large cap stocks) should help small company stocks perform well.

<UL>
<LI>The Large Company Growth Fund sustained a solid performance margin over its benchmark during 1996.  Its annual return placed it in the top 15% of its Lipper Growth Fund peer group of 669 mutual funds.
<LI>The stock market turned in a very impressive year.  In particular, growth stocks performed very well as their earnings stood out amidst moderating profits for the average company.
<LI>As a pure growth style, the Fund participated fully in the growth stock leadership.  Portfolio companies demonstrated their superior fundamental characteristics.  Average annual earnings gains of 23% for the Fund's stocks far exceeded the 6%-8% earnings gains for the S&amp;P 500 Index.
<LI>The performance leaders during the year included Intel, Microsoft, Charles Schwab, Coca-Cola and LM Ericcson.  After broad participation during the first three quarters of the year, portfolio leadership narrowed some in the fourth quarter.

<B>Performance Highlights</B>
</H4>
<UL>
<LI>The Fund performed well during 1996, outperforming its benchmark and ranking in the top half of its Lipper Small Company Growth Funds peer group for the year.
<LI>During 1996, small company stocks materially underperformed large company stocks.  In general, small value stocks outperformed small growth stocks.
<LI>The Fund's fourth quarter results reflected the sharp performance divergence between small cap growth and value stocks.  The Russell 2000 Value Index rose 10% while its Growth Index was flat, paralleling the Fund's Overlooked/ Discovery results during the quarter.  The Fund's energy-related holdings and selected technology stocks, however, performed very well.
<LI>As we enter the new year, we believe that interest in small company stocks will grow as investors seek out those stocks whose appreciation prospects are still bright and which have yet to reach the higher valuations already attained by large cap stocks.
<LI>The Fund is positioned favorably relative to the overall market and possesses potential for dramatic gains.  The Fund's current holdings are expected to grow earnings at 24% per year compared to single digits for the general market (S&amp;P 500 Index), and are valued at only 16x 1997 earnings, well below the 18x P/E accorded the market.

<LI>The Fund is performing very well and is in the top third of its Lipper peer group on a year-to-date basis.  The Fund's yield exceeds that of its yield benchmark, the 5-year Treasury note, by 74 basis points.
<LI>Yields in the intermediate portion (maturities ranging from 3-10 years) of the Treasury yield curve ended the third quarter unchanged.  Volatility was a prevalent factor, however, with yields fluctuating within a 60 basis point trading range.
<LI>During the quarter, we increased the Fund's investment in Treasury notes by 8% to 74%.  We reduced our holding in the agency note sector to 5% as the spreads had become too tight to compensate for the lower liquidity in that market.

<B><I>Information presented is for the Fund's I Shares. The yield provided is for the 30 days through the end of the above period. Average annual total returns were</I></B> 4.13%, 2.44%, 5.46% <B><I>and</I></B> 6.79% <B><I>for the 1, 3, 5 and 10 year periods, respectively, for the period ending 9/30/96. These returns include reinvestment of dividends and capital gains. During this period, some of the Fund's fees may have been waived; if these fees were not waived, total return would have been lower. Results represent past performance and do not guarantee future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate, and shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than original cost.</I></B></I>

<P><I>
<B><I>Prior to November 11, 1994, Norwest Bank Minnesota, N.A. managed a collective trust fund with investment objectives and policies substantially the same as those of the Fund. The performance for the Fund includes the performance of the predecessor collective investment fund for periods before it became a mutual fund on November 11, 1994. The collective investment fund performance was adjusted to reflect the Fund's 1994 estimate of its expense ratio for the first year of operations as a mutual fund. The collective investment fund was not registered under the 1940 Act or subject to certain investment restrictions that are imposed by the Act. If the collective investment fund had been registered under the 1940 Act, the collective investment fund historical return may have been adversely affected.</I></B></I>

<B>Performance Highlights</B>
</H4>
<UL>
<LI>After a recovery in November, international equity markets gave back some of their gains during December.  Most of this decline came from the Far East.  The Hong Kong stock market fell 0.5%; despite this, we believe that it still offers some attractive buying opportunities and added Wharf Holdings Ltd. to the Fund.  The emerging Asian countries that continue to disappoint include Korea and Thailand where December declines were 12.7% and 11.6%, respectively.
<LI>Japan slipped again during December, falling 6.9%.  Disappointing corporate earnings and rising taxes caused much of the weakness.  We continue to expect the rate of corporate profit growth in Japan to be among the best of the developed markets in 1997, which should help the relative performance of the market.
<LI>Shares in Continental Europe remained strong as countries continued to keep a tight leash on monetary and fiscal policies in their on-going efforts to satisfy stringent European Monetary Union requirements.  The Netherlands rose 2.6% during December, France gained 1.0% and the United Kingdom advanced 3.5%.  We restructured a portion of our portfolio by selling Sphinx, a Netherlands manufacturer of furnishings and fittings and CS Holdings, a Swiss financial company, while adding SAP AG, a German software developer.

<LI>The diversified bond portfolio performed very well during the year.  Its annual return of 3.44% placed it near the top third of its Lipper peer group of 176 Intermediate Investment Grade Debt Funds.  The stable income style gained 5.46% during the year, while the short maturity investments segment yielded roughly 6.00%.
<LI>Bond prices were volatile all year long and reacted swiftly to changes in economic news, particularly on inflation.  Bond yields rose during the year -- the 30-year Treasury bond, which yielded 5.95% at the beginning of 1996, traded in a 125 basis point range during the year to end at 6.65%.
<LI>The diversified equity portfolio was up 20.43% for the year, placing it near the top half of its Lipper peers and ahead of its benchmark by 69 basis points.
<LI>The S&amp;P 500 Index of large company stocks posted an 8.34% advance during the fourth quarter and an annual return of 22.96%.  The economic environment of steady growth and low inflation, coupled with strong corporate earnings, helped fuel the stock market rally.

<B><I>Prior to November 11, 1994, Norwest Bank Minnesota, N.A. managed a collective trust fund with investment objectives and policies substantially the same as those of the Fund. The performance for the Fund includes the performance of the predecessor collective investment fund for periods before it became a mutual fund on November 11, 1994. The collective investment fund performance was adjusted to reflect the Fund's 1994 estimate of its expense ratio for the first year of operations as a mutual fund. The collective investment fund was not registered under the 1940 Act or subject to certain investment restrictions that are imposed by the Act. If the collective investment fund had been registered under the 1940 Act, the collective investment fund historical return may have been adversely affected.</I></B></I>

<P>
<B><I>Investment Objective:</I></B> To provide capital appreciation with current income as an incidental goal. The Fund currently  seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing all of its investment assets in Schroder U.S. Smaller Companies Portfolio (the "Portfolio"), a separate portfolio of a registered open-end management company with an identical investment objective. Accordingly, the Small Cap Opportunities Fund's investment experience will correspond directly with the Portfolio's investment experience, as reflected below.

<B>Performance Highlights</B>
</H4>
<UL>
<LI>After several months of underperformance, small company stocks outperformed large company holdings in December, though they ended up underperforming for the year as a whole.  
<LI>For the month of December, health care, consumer staples, financial services and energy were the best performing sectors of the market.  Managed care providers such as Compdent and Healthsource were strong performers after significant weakness earlier in the quarter.  Consumer staples stocks performed well as investors fled retailers and other cyclicals in favor of more conservative consumer stocks.  Financial stocks, like Walden Bancorp, UST Corp. and Banknorth Group, outperformed in the month as earnings estimates were revised upward and merger and acquisition activity continued.  Energy stocks continued to outperform the market; this category was the best performing sector for the year with a strong 76% return.  Our overweight position in the group added to the Fund's performance during the year.
<LI>The weakest performing sectors were utilities, consumer discretionary and technology.  The Fund has no exposure to utilities.  We are overweight, however, in consumer discretionary stocks, which impacted performance during December.
<LI>Looking forward to 1997, we are optimistic about the prospects for smaller company stocks.  We believe that many small companies offer more attractive investment opportunities than larger companies based on both valuation and growth rates.

<LI>The money market yield curve (yields on securities with maturities of up to 1 year) flattened during December -- year-end borrowing demand forced yields higher in very short maturities (overnight to 1 month), while yields fell 10 to 20 basis points for longer maturities.
<LI>We were cautious about holding many securities maturing in January, as rates often decline during that month.  During the quarter, we continued to purchase selected longer securities (maturing in 9 months to 1 year) as we found attractive values.

<B>Performance Highlights</B>
</H4>
<UL>
<LI>The Fund continues to perform extremely well.  Its return matched that of its Lipper peer group average for December and has ranked it within the top 15% of its peers for the quarter, the year and the last 3 years.
<LI>No major changes in average maturity or duration were made during December.  The Fund continues to maintain about a 17 year average maturity and a duration slightly under 8 years.  The portfolio has a high credit quality profile with 75% rated AA or better.  Recent changes in the Fund focused on structure, particularly in improving call protection.
<LI>While analyzing the performance of various sectors of the Fund, it is clear that the best performance came from lower quality holdings.  This was true during December and for the year as a whole.  This is explained by the fact that interest rates moved in no clear direction but within a fairly narrow trading range throughout the year.  Furthermore, interest rates were relatively low, while investors were desirous of higher yields, thereby raising the demand for lower quality holdings and causing quality spreads to narrow.  This benefited the price of lower quality issues.

<LI>The Fund performed superbly all year long with an annual return that was 1.01% higher than that of the average fund in the Lipper Colorado Municipal Debt Funds peer group.  The Fund ranked in the top 10% of this group for the year.
<LI>New issue supply in the municipal bond market increased a great deal after election day, because a number of bond elections were passed by the voters of various cities and school districts.
<LI>Because net admissions into the Fund were minimal during the quarter, only a couple of new names were added to the Fund.  We made no major changes in the Fund during the last three months.
<LI>Longer duration and lower credit quality holdings were the best performing assets in the Fund during the fourth quarter.  Cash equivalents and mortgage revenue bonds were the worst performing sectors.

<UL>
<LI>During the fourth quarter, the municipal bond market rallied.  This was fueled primarily by the fall presidential and congressional elections, which produced no surprises and by the economy, which continued to show signs of slower growth and moderate inflation.
<LI>Yields along the municipal money market yield curve (maturities up to 1 year) declined by 10-15 basis points in the short end of the curve and by 25-30 basis points in the 1-year area.  Yields within the variable rate sector of the municipal market remained relatively unchanged throughout the majority of the fourth quarter.
<LI>During the fourth quarter, the Fund's assets increased by $60 million.  Its yield increased 19 basis points, while its average maturity decreased by 21 days to 54 days.

Once you've read these instructions, click below the title on whichever version you have the bandwidth for to download one of the latest Laugher bits I did for ACN. Read the opening Announcer line as the sound is finished downloading, and your AIFF helper application is starting up. Then, as the sound starts playing, jump right in and perform the script below, continuing as the Announcer. Read the script out loud along with the character. If your timing is right, the character will speak in perfect comedic rhythm with you. Make sure you have your personalized shotgun jingle loaded in the cart machine ready to sting the bit and slam into the stop set or "Get Ready" by the Proclaimers. Record it, send it to your favorite radio station, and wait for the high six-figure contract in the mail!</BLOCKQUOTE><h3>The Laugher: Jackson Us Around</h3><center><b>[<A HREF="resources/sounds/aiff/lojack.aif">Lo-rez .aiff (5 kHz/8 bit mono) 1:49</A>]<br>or<br>[<A HREF="resources/sounds/aiff/midjack.aif">Mid-rez .aiff (11 kHz/8 bit mono) 1:49</A>]</b><br>Copyright &copy1995 American Comedy Network.

You know that if you have to put people on hold, you risk breaking that fragile connection. So you've added either voice mail or an IVR system or a simple answering machine or an automated attendant or some combination to handle the flow of calls and keep people on the line. Right?<h3>The voice they hear makes all the difference in the world.</h3>How does your system sound? Is your company's image in the forground? Does the voice sound like your best salesman or like someone who's never heard of your product? Not only are your callers on the line, your image is on the line. Use this time to market to them, to educate them, entertain them, inform them. Then, sell them.<h3>Press One * Press Two is the right choice.</h3>We design recorded message bases from scratch. We count among our clients small mom and pop operations trying their best to sound big, and huge multinational corporations trying to stay connected with the individual consumer.

But at what cost?</h3>Prices vary from a minimum of $100 for simple answering machine messages to project pricing for scripting and voicing complex IVR, fax back and audiotex message bases. We can turn your project around in as little as 24 hours, and we provide your audio material on whatever medium you need: tape, DAT, reel or sound files.

The rest is pure sarcasm. :)<p><IMG ALIGN=left SRC="resources/images/photos/eliza1.gif" ALT="eliza in the isolette">Eliza Nicole Lawrence was born on July 22nd, 1995 at 8:09 AM, after only 3 contractions. Wendy had asked for and received the one thing she missed out on when she gave birth to our other daughter, Madison Erica, two and a half years earlier...an epidural.<br><br>4 hours later, the neonatologist informed us that they were transferring Eliza to St. Agnes' Neonatal ICU up in Baltimore. She was having problems regulating her glucose levels. Here she is in her isolette, leads and IV's everywhere.<br><br>What a trooper.<br clear=left><hr><IMG ALIGN=right SRC="resources/images/photos/eliza3.gif" ALT="daddy and eliza">While Wendy was in the hospital over the weekend, I went to the NICU to visit Eliza. I was able to hold her hand through an access port in her isolette. The nurses and doctors and the NICU are terrific...they <b>told</b> us things, putting our minds at ease, whereas others in the process didn't.<br><br>It turns out that about 30% of infants born slightly premature and larger than normal have a bit of a problem adjusting their glucose levels. An IV drip that was lessened and eventually removed corrected this imbalance.<br clear=right><hr><IMG ALIGN=left SRC="resources/images/photos/eliza2.gif" ALT="me and wendy and eliza">We went to St. Agnes every day to feed her and watch the staff do there work. After every feeding, they'd do a "chem strip" test to make sure that Eliza was maintaining her glucose levels between accepted norms.<br><br>Once she was able to do that without the drip, she was started on heavier feedings, and eventually was able to go a full 24 hours without dropping below the minumum. We got a chance to hold her a lot, and the nurses kept telling us how great she was doing. This kept us from becoming basket cases. <br clear=left><hr><IMG ALIGN=right SRC="resources/images/photos/eliza4.gif" ALT="wendy and eliza"><br><br>We finally got to bring her home three days after the ordeal began. Wendy got to ride in the back seat all the way home, scrunched between Eliza's car seat and Madison's.<br><br>Stitches and cramps and all, I don't think there's any place else she would have wanted to be.<br clear=right><hr><h3>OK...enough seriousness...</h3><IMG ALIGN=left SRC="resources/images/photos/newborn.gif" ALT="me as a baby">Life began for me on September 20th, 1958 at 8:35 PM. I was born in the exact bed as my mother was 20 years earlier at Cleveland's famed Polyclinic Hospital, and I recall my mother complaining that they still hadn't changed the sheets. <br> <br> Here, my father pauses to admire my Fatty Arbuckle impression before heading down to Dermatology to have his hands surgically separated.<br clear=left><hr><IMG ALIGN=right SRC="resources/images/photos/reading.gif" ALT="harold and me reading">My brother and I loved to read. We especially like to read with 3D glasses on, even if the books weren't in 3D. I miss those incredible headaches to this day. <br> <br>I remember my mother placing me on the counter at the Tobin Page drug store on Euclid Avenue in East Cleveland, where I would show off and read the stock quotes from the Plain Dealer for lollipops and the occasional raw fish. <br> <br>If you look closely, you will see the very top of the National Lampoon tucked away inside our Mighty Mouse comic. Now, *that* kept our attention.<br clear=right><hr><IMG ALIGN=left SRC="resources/images/photos/familytv.gif" ALT="the yarnells">The Yarnells were my parents best friends. They had a TV, and we had a basement that often flooded in those harsh Cleveland Heights springtime thaws. Dave Yarnell, may he rest in peace, was constantly at Thistledown, betting the trifecta, leaving Betty in charge of raising Brucie, Marcie, Tracie and Stacie. <br> <br>Years later, at Stacie's shotgun wedding, Brucie would approach me. "Anything you need, you let me or Anthony know." Anthony cautioned me not to refer to him as 'Brucie' any longer, if I valued being able to speak on the radio.<br clear=left><hr><IMG ALIGN=right SRC="resources/images/photos/gasmask.gif" ALT="me and mom with gasmasks">The air in Cleveland was OK, I guess. I never really found out. One morning, I took off on my tricycle from East 105th and Euclid and headed downtown. Got through Collinwood, Hough, and was almost to East 30th when a policeman stopped me.<br> <br> "I'm going to see my mom where she works at Sterling Lindner," I said brightly.<br> <br>He chided me for not wearing a mask so far from home, handed me a spare from the trunk of his cruiser, and patted my head. He then drove away. By the time I got to Sterling Lindner, it was past closing time. A kindly lady in a very short skirt was standing in front of the store. She and her supervisor, Mr. Smith, took time out of their busy work night to return me safely at home.<br clear=right><hr><IMG ALIGN=left SRC="resources/images/photos/newsboy.gif" ALT="delivering the press">Harold and I had paper routes. He delivered the Plain Dealer, and I delivered the Press. Here is a rare shot of me actually selling the papers, as opposed to sitting on the top stairs of the apartment buildings on Mayfield Road. It was there that I would try my first Swisher Sweet cigar, and it was there that I would first throw up in public.<br> <br>I actually won a trip to Six Gun Territory in Orlando one year for increasing my route by 10 customers. The older carriers who would canvas the neighborhood for new customers, stealing them from the younger boys who actually had routes there, all became strangely ill after a party I held. Mom was right...after a hint or two that it was spiked, they *did* drink the special punch.<br clear=left><hr><IMG ALIGN=right SRC="resources/images/photos/flexible.gif" ALT="cousin donna">Cousin Donna.<br><br>I really don't want to talk about it here.<br clear=right><hr><IMG ALIGN=left SRC="resources/images/photos/theatre.gif" ALT="teen at the movies">Growing up, the theater was always a big part of my life, especially the joy of standing in line for popcorn and Goobers. My mother used to take our family to the movies, and then sneak out in the middle of the first reel. After six or seven years of this, we all began to suspect that something was up. Here, my sister Elaine tries to stop my mother from sneaking out yet again.<br> <br> That's me in the upper right, hoping to hell that Raquel Welch's top falls off, *just* for a moment, in 3-D. This was taken several days befor my own hand separation surgery.<br clear=left><hr><IMG ALIGN=right SRC="resources/images/photos/nun.gif" ALT="mary nachtman">My very first girlfriend, Mary Nachtman. I brought her home to meet my parents, and there was my dad, sitting at the dining room table, shirtless, filling out his driving logs. "Want a sandwich or a beer?" he asked Mary.<br>"No, thank you," she replied.<br><br>"How about a punch in the mouth?" he joked.<br>"Take me home," she demanded.<br><br>She would later enter the convent, muttering all the while and claiming she was saying the Rosary whenever someone noticed.<br clear=right><hr><IMG ALIGN=left SRC="resources/images/photos/promnite.gif" ALT="mike curry and me">Prom night, 1976. Mike Curry and his date, John Bailey and his date, and I and my date all board the bus to the Iron Gate for dinner. Surf and turf had just topped $15 and I was ready. The waitress kept calling me Toots. <br><br>I had an great time that night with my girlfriend, Fawn Archambault, and later, she would surprise me by spending time in my back seat with John Rego. And Milo Swanson. And every other boy in the senior class except Brian Uveges, since he wasn't there. She was too tired to go to Cedar Point the next day.<br clear=left><hr><IMG ALIGN=right SRC="resources/images/photos/pantyrad.gif" ALT="fun at ohio state">I went to Ohio State, and majored in both Computer and Information Science and Broadcast Communications. I also learned that the best friends you'll ever have are the ones you have when you're stealing underwear from the women. The Stadium Dorm is far and away the best place on campus to live, and if it wasn't for being caught in the Unit D utility room in a comprimising position with Arlene Wichter, I might have stayed there for longer than just one year.<br><br>Here, the boys of Unit V display the catch of the day.<br clear=right><hr><IMG ALIGN=left SRC="resources/images/photos/ax.gif" ALT="my first radio job">My first program director, E. Karl, offering me some pointers. <br><br>At WNCI, they had unusual motivational techniques.<br clear=left><hr><IMG ALIGN=right SRC="resources/images/photos/dancers.gif" ALT="dance competition">Along with being on the radio, I also was the DJ at a swanky private nightclub in Upper Arlington called Whisper. We used to have incredibly exciting dance competitions, and the crowds (shown here) would clamor for a good seat.<br><br>It was here that my reputation as a club DJ led to the first of several Billboard DJ of the year awards, as well as several treatable communicable diseases.<br><br><br><br>I still have most of the 12 inch records from my nightclub career, and someday, I'll find a couple of Technics SL-MKII turntables, a GLI mixer, a JBL amp and some Klipsch speakers, and really piss off my neighbors.<br clear=right><hr><IMG ALIGN=left SRC="resources/images/photos/newlywed.gif" ALT="my first marriage">Me and my first wife, Kim. We were married for one year to the day. It was just too hard to balance everything, so we just dropped it.<br clear=left><hr><IMG ALIGN=right SRC="resources/images/photos/headgear.gif" ALT="my sister Elaine">My sister Elaine is actually much prettier than it looks here. She always would come to the openings of the clubs I played at and the events that the radio stations would hold. She's a hair designer, and, as you can see, she's also a fairly competent HVAC engineer.<br><br>Unfortunately, this well-intentioned attempt at marrying the two passions in her life failed to gel properly.<br clear=right><hr><IMG ALIGN=left SRC="resources/images/photos/rolderby.gif" ALT="roller derby">If there was anything in life I wish I had done, it was to be a member of America's Dream Team, the LA Thunderbirds. In the world of Danny Reilly, Ronnie Rains and #747, Big Mama, the circular battlefield of roller derby is poised to make a comeback. You mark my words. And maybe, just maybe, <b>I'll</b> be the one wearing the helmet, getting whipped from the jam, screaming around the track and hipchecking my way to a clean score. And just as I touch my hands to my hips to signal the end of the jam, a chair will come flying through the air. They'll go to a commercial, then come back to see if I'm still alive. <br><br>Man, that's living.<br clear=left><hr>	<center>		<A HREF="home.html"><IMG ALIGN=bottom border=0 SRC="resources/images/bars/bar_home_small.gif"></A><A HREF="radio.html"><IMG ALIGN=bottom border=0 SRC="resources/images/bars/bar_rad_small.gif"></A><A HREF="computers.html"><IMG ALIGN=bottom border=0 SRC="resources/images/bars/bar_com_small.gif"></A><A HREF="p1p2.html"><IMG ALIGN=bottom border=0 SRC="resources/images/bars/bar_p1p2_small.gif"></A><A HREF="olt.html"><IMG ALIGN=bottom border=0 SRC="resources/images/bars/bar_olt_small.gif"></A><A HREF="webstuff.html"><IMG ALIGN=bottom border=0 SRC="resources/images/bars/bar_web_small.gif"></A><A HREF="personal.html"><IMG ALIGN=bottom border=0 SRC="resources/images/bars/bar_per_small.gif"></A><A HREF="mailto:voxtalent@aol.com"><IMG ALIGN=bottom border=0 SRC="resources/images/bars/bar_email_small.gif"></A><hr>		[<A HREF="home.html">Home</A>] [<A HREF="radio.html">Radio</A>] [<A HREF="computers.html">Computers</A>] [<A HREF="p1p2.html">Press1*Press2</A>] [<A HREF="olt.html">OnLine Today</A>] [<A HREF="webstuff.html">Web Design</A>] [<A HREF="personal.html">Personal</A>] [<A HREF="mailto:voxtalent@aol.com">Mail</A>]		<p>		<IMG ALIGN=bottom SRC="resources/images/headers/dhl_banner.gif">		<KBD>			<br>			All contents copyright &#169;1995 David Lawrence.<br><B>Comments?</B> Use this <A HREF="comments.html">form</a> or send me e-mail at <A HREF="mailto:voxtalent@aol.com">voxtalent@aol.com</A>		</KBD>		<hr>	<A HREF="http://www.pointcom.com"><IMG ALIGN=bottom SRC="resources/images/logos/5percmdt.gif" ALT="Yep, we're a Point Top 5% of All Websites Site!"></A><hr> 	<A HREF="http://www.halsoft.com/html-val-svc/">    <IMG SRC="http://www.halsoft.com/html-val-svc/images/valid_html.mcom.gif"     ALT="HTML HaL Mozilla Checked!"></A>	</center></body></html>

("AOL  Inc."), is a computer online, interactive information, communication and transaction service.   The AOL Service is available to an authorized member (hereinafter referred to as "Member," "Members," when used collectively   or "You") through a personal membership account ("Membership"); it is  accessible through a  personal computer, or other access device, using AOL Software (e.g. the software used to  connect to the AOL Service) and a communications connection (e.g., modem, telephone line).<p>1.2  Please read this document carefully.  Please also read the "Rules of the Road."  This  document, the Rules of the Road, and the "Membership Conditions" (which You saw when You  first signed on) are all of the applicable AOL Service rules.  (They collectively comprise the  contract between AOL Inc. and Members and are collectively referred to as the "Terms of  Service" or "TOS").  You can view all of these documents on the AOL Service at any time free  of charge in the "Members' Online Support" department located within the "Member's Services"  Area. <p>1.3  BY COMPLETING THE ENROLLMENT PROCESS AND USING THE AOL SERVICE AND AOL SOFTWARE  (OTHER THAN TO READ THE TOS AGREEMENT AND THE RULES OF THE ROAD FOR THE FIRST TIME), YOU  AGREE TO BE LEGALLY BOUND AND TO ABIDE BY THE TERMS OF SERVICE, JUST AS IF YOU HAD SIGNED  THIS AGREEMENT.  If You do not wish to be bound by our TOS, You may not continue to use the  AOL Service and AOL Software.  In that case, You should immediately terminate your  Membership account and You are prohibited from using AOL Software. <p>1.4  AOL Inc. may modify its TOS at any time and in any manner.  Any modification is effective  immediately upon either a posting on the AOL Service, electronic mail, or conventional mail.  If  any modification to the TOS is unacceptable to You, You may immediately terminate your  Membership as provided in Section 8 below.  YOUR CONTINUED USE OF THE AOL SERVICE FOLLOWING MODIFICATION TO THE TOS SHALL BE CONCLUSIVELY DEEMED AS ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH MODIFICATION.<p>1.5  The Terms of Service Agreement, Rules of the Road and the Membership Conditions  together constitute the entire and only agreement between AOL Inc. and Member with respect  to the AOL Service and AOL Software.  AOL Inc. may discontinue or alter any aspect of the  AOL Service, including, but not limited to, (i) restricting the time of availability, (ii) restricting the availability and/or scope of the AOL Service for certain platforms (i.e., computer types and  operating systems), (iii) restricting the amount of use permitted, and (iv) restricting or  terminating any Member's right to use the AOL Service, at AOL Inc.'s sole discretion and  without prior notice or liability.  AOL Inc. reserves the right to change or add any fees or surcharges at any time effective upon thirty (30) days' prior notice. <p><A NAME="2">2</A>.  Member Responsibilities<p>2.1  Connect Charges.<p>Member is responsible for all charges (e.g., telephone) associated with connecting to the AOL Service through an available access number.  THE ACCESS NUMBER IS  USUALLY, BUT NOT ALWAYS, A LOCAL TELEPHONE CALL.  Please read Section 2.A (ii) of the Rules of  the Road for a more detailed explanation of telephone charges or search "Local Access  Number" under the "Help" menu. To find additional or closer access numbers use keyword "Access."<p>2.2  Equipment. <p>Member is responsible for obtaining or providing all telephone access lines, telephone and computer equipment (including modem), or other access device, necessary to  access the AOL Service.<p>2.3.  Registration.  <p>MEMBER CERTIFIES TO AOL INC. THAT HE/SHE IS AN INDIVIDUAL (E.G., NOT A CORPORATION) AND AT LEAST EIGHTEEN (18) YEARS OF AGE.  AOL Inc. may, at its discretion, enter into special billing arrangements with employers and other entities.  A minor's parent  or legal guardian may authorize a minor's use of Member's account under adult supervision and  with assumption of all liabilities resulting from minor's use.  (Please refer to Section 2.B of the Rules of the Road).  MEMBER AGREES TO PROVIDE AOL INC. WITH ACCURATE, COMPLETE, AND  UPDATED INFORMATION REQUIRED BY THE REGISTRATION TO THE AOL SERVICE ("Member  Registration Data"), including Member's legal name, address, telephone number(s), and  applicable payment data (i.e., credit card number and expiration date or checking account  information).  Member agrees to notify AOL Inc. within thirty (30) days of any changes in  Member Registration Data.  Failure to comply fully with this provision may result in immediate  suspension or termination of your right to use the AOL Service.<p>2.4  Accounts/Charges/Payment.<p>(a)  Accounts.<p> The TOS applies to all sub-accounts and alternate screen names  associated with Member's principal account(s) ("Master Account(s)").  Each Member is responsible for all activities and charges resulting from use of Member's Master Account(s)  under any screen name of the Master Account(s) by any person, and for ensuring full  compliance with the TOS by all users of his/her Master Account(s). AOL Service Master  Account(s) may not be transferred without prior written approval from AOL Inc. and is subject to any limits established by AOL Inc.  <p>(b)  Passwords.  <p>Upon your enrollment as a Member, You will select a unique password.   Member is responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of his/her password and is liable for  any harm resulting from disclosing or allowing disclosure of any password. In the event of a  breach of security, Member will remain liable for any unauthorized use of the AOL Service until  Member notifies AOL Inc. by calling 1-800-827-6364.<p>(c)  Payment.  <p>Current rates for using the AOL Service may be obtained by calling AOL  Inc. Customer Service or by using keyword "Billing." Member will pay all sales, use, value- added, personal property or other governmental tax or levy imposed on the goods or services  billed to his/her Master Account(s), other than taxes based on net income or profits of AOL Inc.   If AOL Inc. does not receive the full amount of Member's AOL Service account balance within thirty (30) days of invoice date, an additional 1.5% (or the highest amount allowed by law,  whichever is lower) per month late charge will be added to Member's bill and shall be due and  payable.  Member shall also be liable for all attorney and collection fees arising from AOL Inc.'s  efforts to collect any unpaid balance of Member's Master Account(s). <p>2.5  Online Conduct.  <p>Any conduct by a Member that in AOL Inc.'s discretion restricts or inhibits any other Member from using or enjoying the AOL Service will not be permitted.  Member  agrees to use the AOL Service only for lawful purposes. Member is prohibited from posting on  or transmitting through the AOL Service any unlawful, harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing,  defamatory, vulgar, obscene, profane, hateful, racially, ethnically or otherwise objectionable material of any kind, including, but not limited to, any material which encourages conduct that  would constitute a criminal offense, give rise to civil liability or otherwise violate any applicable  local, state, national or international law.<p>2.6  Content<p>(a)  Proprietary Rights.<p>Member acknowledges that the AOL Service contains  information, software, photos, video, graphics, music, sounds or other material (collectively, "Content") that are protected by copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets or other proprietary  rights, and that these rights are valid and protected in all forms, media and technologies  existing now or hereinafter developed. All Content is copyrighted as a collective work under the  U.S. Copyright laws, and AOL Inc. owns a copyright in the selection, coordination, arrangement  and enhancement of such Content.  Member may not modify, publish, transmit, participate in  the transfer or sale, create derivative works, or in any way exploit, any of the Content, in whole  or in part. If no specific restrictions are displayed, Member may make copies of portions of the  Content, including copyrighted material, trademarks, or other proprietary materials, provided  that the copies are made only for Member's personal use and that Member maintains any  notices contained in the Content such as all copyright notices, trademark legends or other  proprietary rights notices.  Except as provided in the preceding sentence or as permitted by the fair use privilege under the U.S. copyright laws (see e.g. 17 U.S.C. Section 107), You may not upload,  post, reproduce, or distribute Content protected by copyright, or other proprietary right, without  obtaining permission of the copyright owner.  Use of any software Content shall be governed by  the software license agreement accompanying such software or, if none exists, then such use  shall be proscribed by the terms governing licensing and use of the AOL Software as provided  in Section 6 herein.<p>(b) Distribution/Uploading of Third Party Content.<p>Member may upload to the software  files or otherwise distribute on the AOL Service only Content that is not subject to any copyright  or other proprietary rights protection (collectively, "Public Domain Content"), or Content in which  the author has given express authorization for on-line distribution.  Any copyrighted Content  submitted with the consent of a copyright owner should contain a phrase such as "Copyright  owned by [name of the owner]; Used by Permission."  The unauthorized submission of  copyrighted or other proprietary Content constitutes a breach of the TOS and could subject You  to criminal prosecution as well as personal liability for damages in a civil suit.  Remember You,  not AOL Inc. or its independent contractors, are liable for any damage resulting from any  infringement of copyrights, proprietary rights, or any other harm arising from such submission.     By submitting Content to any "Public Area" (Public Area(s) are those areas of the AOL Service  that are generally accessible to other Members, such as chat rooms, message boards, and file  uploads) You automatically grant, or warrant that the owner of such Content has expressly granted, AOL Inc. the royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive right and license to  use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate and distribute the Content (in whole or part)  worldwide and/or to incorporate it in other works in any form, media, or technology now known  or hereafter developed for the full term of any copyright that may exist in such Content. You  also permit any Member to access, view, store or reproduce the Content for that Member's  personal use.  Subject to this grant, the owner of Content placed on the AOL Service retains  any and all rights which may exist in such Content.<p>(c)  Export.  <p>The U.S. export control laws regulate the export and re-export of  technology originating in the United States.  This includes the electronic transmission of  information and software to foreign countries and to certain foreign nationals.  Member agrees  to abide by these laws -- including but not limited to the Export Administration Act, the Arms  Export Control Act and their implementing regulations -- and not to transfer, by electronic transmission or otherwise, any Content derived from the AOL Service to either a foreign  national or a foreign destination without first obtaining any required government authorization.   Member further agrees not to upload to the AOL Service any data or software that cannot be  exported without prior written government authorization, including, but not limited to, certain types of encryption software.  This assurance and commitment shall survive termination of the  Agreement.  In addition, because the U.S. export control laws currently prohibit nationals of  Cuba, Iran, Libya, North Korea and Syria from gaining access to certain Content on the AOL  Service, nationals of these countries currently may not legally access the AOL Service at this time.<p>(d)  Benefit of Provisions.  <p>The foregoing provisions of this section 2.6 are for the benefit of AOL Inc.   and its independent third-party information providers ("Information Providers"), merchants ("Merchants") and  licensors ("Licensors"), and each shall have the right to assert and enforce such provisions directly on their  own behalf. <p>2.7  Third Party Content.  <p>AOL Inc. is a distributor (and not a publisher) of Content supplied by  third parties and Members.  Accordingly, AOL Inc.  has no more editorial control over such Content than  does a public library, bookstore, or newsstand.  Any opinions, advice, statements, services,  offers, or other information or Content expressed or made available by third parties, including  Information Providers, Merchants (as defined herein), Members, or any other user of the AOL  Service, are those of the respective author(s) or distributor(s) and not of AOL Inc.  NEITHER AOL  INC. NOR ANY THIRD-PARTY PROVIDER OF INFORMATION GUARANTEES THE ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS,  OR USEFULNESS OF ANY CONTENT, NOR ITS MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR  PURPOSE.  (Refer to Section 5 below for the complete provisions governing limitation of liabilities  and disclaimers of warranty.) <p>In many instances, the Content available through the AOL Service represents the  opinions and judgments of the respective Information Provider, Member, or other user not  under contract with AOL Inc.  AOL Inc. neither endorses nor is responsible for the accuracy or  reliability of any opinion, advice or statement made on the AOL Service by anyone other than  authorized AOL Inc. employee spokespersons while acting in their official capacities. (Forum leaders and Member Guides are not authorized spokespersons.)  Under no circumstances will  AOL Inc. be liable for any loss or damage caused by a Member's reliance on information  obtained through the AOL Service.  It is the responsibility of Member to evaluate the accuracy,  completeness or usefulness of any information, opinion, advice or other Content available through the AOL Service.  Please seek the advice of professionals, as appropriate, regarding  the evaluation of any specific information, opinion, advice, or other Content.<p>2.8  Retention of Files.  <p>Member is responsible for retention of all files, information data and  other materials as may be necessary for reconstruction of any files, information material or  messages lost or misprocessed by AOL Inc.<p><A NAME="3">3</A>.  Third-Party Sales and Services<p>3.1  Member may order and purchase merchandise or services from other Members and users  of the AOL Service, who are not affiliated with AOL Inc.  All transactions concerning third-party  ("Merchant") goods or services, including, but not limited to, purchase terms, payment terms,  warranties, guarantees, maintenance and delivery, are solely between Merchant and Member.   AOL Inc. makes no warranties or representations whatsoever with regard to any good or  service provided or offered by any Merchant.  AOL Inc. shall not be a party to a transaction between  Member and Merchant, or be liable for any cost or damage arising either directly or indirectly  from any action or inaction of any Merchant.<p>AOL Inc.'s Rights<p>4.1  AOL Inc. may elect to electronically monitor the Public Areas for adherence to its TOS and may disclose any Content, records or electronic communication of any kind (i) to satisfy any law, regulation or authorized governmental request, (ii)  if such disclosure is necessary to operate the AOL Service, or (iii) to protect the rights or property of AOL Inc., its Members, or Information Providers or Merchants.<p>4.2  AOL Inc. reserves the right to prohibit conduct, communication, or Content which it deems in its discretion to be harmful to individual Members, the communities which make up the AOL Service, AOL Inc.'s or other third-party rights, or to violate any applicable law.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither AOL Inc. nor its Information Providers have the practical ability to restrict conduct, communication or Content which might violate its TOS prior to transmission on the AOL Service, nor can they ensure prompt editing or removal of questionable Content after on-line posting. Accordingly, neither AOL Inc. nor any Information Provider shall assume liability for any action or inaction with respect to conduct, communication or Content on the AOL Service.<p>4.3  AOL Inc. will not intentionally monitor or disclose any private electronic communication unless permitted or required by law.  AOL Inc. may terminate immediately without notice any Member who misuses or fails to abide by the TOS, including, without limitation, misuse of the software libraries, discussion boards, E-Mail, or conference areas.<p>4.4  Unless Member elects otherwise by selecting the appropriate "Marketing Preference" choice (Keyword "Marketing Preferences"), AOL Inc. reserves the right to distribute to merchants or third parties certain general Member information, such as Member's name and mailing address.  AOL Inc. will  not distribute specific Member billing information (i.e. credit card or checking account numbers).<p>5. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AND DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY<p>5.1 MEMBER EXPRESSLY AGREES THAT USE OF THE AOL SERVICE IS AT MEMBER'S SOLE RISK. NEITHER AOL INC., ITS EMPLOYEES, AFFILIATES, AGENTS, THIRD-PARTY INFORMATION PROVIDERS, MERCHANTS, LICENSORS OR THE LIKE, WARRANT THAT THE AOL SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR FREE;  NOR DO THEY MAKE ANY WARRANTY AS TO THE RESULTS THAT MAY BE OBTAINED FROM THE USE OF THE AOL SERVICE, OR AS TO THE ACCURACY, RELIABILITY OR CONTENT OF ANY INFORMATION, SERVICE, OR MERCHANDISE PROVIDED THROUGH THE AOL SERVICE.  NEITHER AOL INC. NOR ANY OF ITS INDEPENDENT NETWORK SERVICE PROVIDERS MAKE ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, THAT ANY AVAILABLE ACCESS NUMBER WILL BE A LOCAL CALL FROM YOUR AREA CODE AND EXCHANGE.<p>5.2 THE AOL SERVICE IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS," "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WARRANTIES OF TITLE OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OTHER THAN THOSE WARRANTIES WHICH ARE IMPLIED BY AND INCAPABLE OF EXCLUSION, RESTRICTION OR MODIFICATION UNDER THE LAWS APPLICABLE TO THIS AGREEMENT.  NO ORAL ADVICE OR WRITTEN INFORMATION GIVEN BY AOL, INC., ITS EMPLOYEES, AGENTS (INCLUDING MEMBER REPRESENTATIVES OR GUIDES), THIRD-PARTY INFORMATION PROVIDERS, MERCHANTS, LICENSORS OR THE LIKE, SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY; NOR SHALL MEMBER RELY ON ANY SUCH INFORMATION OR ADVICE.<p>5.3 UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE, SHALL AOL INC., OR ANYONE ELSE INVOLVED IN CREATING, PRODUCING OR DISTRIBUTING THE AOL SERVICE OR THE AOL SOFTWARE, BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES THAT RESULT FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE AOL SERVICE INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, RELIANCE BY A MEMBER ON ANY INFORMATION OBTAINED ON THE AOL SERVICE; OR THAT RESULT FROM MISTAKES, OMISSIONS, INTERRUPTIONS, DELETION OF FILES OR E-MAIL, ERRORS, DEFECTS, VIRUSES, DELAYS IN OPERATION, OR TRANSMISSION, OR ANY FAILURE OF PERFORMANCE,WHETHER OR NOT LIMITED TO ACTS OF GOD, COMMUNICATIONS FAILURE, THEFT, DESTRUCTION OR UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO AOL INC.'S RECORDS, PROGRAMS OR SERVICES.  MEMBER HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THIS PARAGRAPH 5.3 SHALL APPLY TO ALL CONTENT, MERCHANDISE OR SERVICES AVAILABLE THROUGH THE AOL SERVICE. BECAUSE SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, IN SUCH STATES AOL'S LIABILITY IS LIMITED TO THE GREATEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.<p>5.4 NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, IN NO EVENT SHALL THE TOTAL LIABILITY OF AOL INC., OR ITS EMPLOYEES, AFFILIATES, AGENTS, THIRD-PARTY INFORMATION PROVIDERS, MERCHANTS OR LICENSORS, FOR ALL DAMAGES, LOSSES AND CAUSES OF ACTION WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE, OR OTHERWISE, EITHER JOINTLY OR SEVERALLY, EXCEED THE AGGREGATE DOLLAR AMOUNT PAID BY MEMBER TO AOL INC. IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRIOR TO THE CLAIMED INJURY OR DAMAGE. The foregoing provisions of this Section 5 are for the benefit of AOL Inc., its employees, directors, affiliates, agents, Information Providers, Merchants and Licensors, and each shall have the right to assert and enforce the provisions directly on their own behalf.<p>6. Software License and Use<p>6.1 AOL Inc. grants to Member a limited license to use AOL Software under the following terms and conditions.  All AOL Software provided to You, and each revised version thereof, is licensed, not sold, to You by AOL Inc. only for use in connecting to the AOL Service from the United States of America, Canada, and other authorized locations internationally.  You may use or copy AOL Software only as specified by AOL Inc., and use or copying for any other purpose violates AOL Inc.'s TOS and is prohibited by law.<p>6.2 As an authorized Member, AOL Inc. grants You a personal, non-transferable and non-exclusive right to use, in object code form only, each authorized copy of AOL Software on as many processors (e.g., personal computers) as You reasonably designate for your use and the use of any authorized sub-accounts under your Master Account(s).  (Please remember that You are responsible for all use of the AOL Software and the AOL Service under your Master Account(s).)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Member is prohibited from using AOL Software and/or the AOL Service for the purpose of exceeding the allotted ten (10) free trial-hours of AOL Service per Master Account, or the then-applicable free trial-hours.<p>6.3 You are permitted to archive AOL Software, provided that all such copies contain the same copyright notice and proprietary markings as are on the original AOL Software.  Unauthorized copying of AOL Software, including AOL Software that has been modified, merged or included with AOL Software or any related written material, is prohibited.  You may not translate, reverse engineer or reverse compile, disassemble or make derivative works from AOL Software.  You may not modify AOL Software in any manner or form, including without limitation for the purpose of obtaining unauthorized access to the AOL Service (e.g., hacking).<p>6.4 You may not sublicense, assign or transfer this license or AOL Software without prior written authorization from AOL Inc.  You agree to destroy all AOL Software and related written material together with any copies promptly when no longer needed or authorized for use, including when termination of Membership is effected as provided herein.  As provided in Section 8 herein, termination or suspension by AOL Inc. automatically terminates or suspends (as the case may be) Member's license to use AOL Software.<p>6.5 AOL Inc.'s entire liability and your exclusive remedy with respect to the use of AOL Software shall be the replacement of any diskette deemed by AOL Inc. to be defective.  AOL INC. MAKES NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED WITH RESPECT TO THE AOL SOFTWARE.  IN NO EVENT SHALL AOL INC. BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES WHICH MIGHT RESULT FROM USING AOL SOFTWARE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF INFORMATION OR MATERIAL OF ANY KIND .<p>7. Indemnification<p>7.1 Upon request of AOL Inc., Member agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless AOL Inc. its officers, directors, employees, agents, third party Information Providers, Merchants and Licensees, from any claims and expenses, including reasonable attorney's fees, related to any violation of the TOS by use of Member's Master Account(s), or in connection with the placement or transmission by or through Member of any Content on the AOL Service and its third party Information Providers, Merchants and Members. <p>8. Termination.<p>8.1 Either Member or AOL Inc. may terminate Membership at any time.  Member's only right with respect to any dissatisfaction with any (i) TOS term or policy, guideline, or practice of AOL Inc. in operating the AOL Service, (ii) Content available through the AOL Service or change therein, or (iii) change in the amount or type of fees charged in connection with the AOL Service, is to terminate Membership by delivering notice to AOL Inc., effective the day AOL Inc. receives notification of termination or such specified future date as may be acceptable to AOL Inc.  In the event that a Member's Master Account is terminated or canceled, any online time credited to Member's Master Account(s) is not convertible to cash or other form of credit.<p>8.2 AOL Inc. may terminate Membership, or suspend any individual Member's access to all or part of the AOL Service, without notice, for any conduct that AOL Inc. in its sole discretion believes violates the TOS, interferes with another Member's enjoyment of the AOL Service, or is harmful to another Member, third-party Information Provider, Merchant, Licensor, service provider or AOL Inc.'s interests.<p>8.3 Termination of Membership automatically terminates service to all other users or sub-accounts under Member's Master Account.  Upon termination of Membership, Member shall have no right to (1) access any stored Content on the AOL Service and any such Content will be forfeited, (2) any user time, game, or other credit(s) and such credit(s) will be forfeited, (3) third-party merchandise or services and AOL, Inc. shall have no responsibility to notify any third-party Merchants, nor for any consequences resulting from lack of notification.  Termination or suspension by AOL Inc. automatically terminates or suspends, as the case may be, Member's license to use AOL Software as provided herein. In the event of Termination, Member remains bound by Sections 2, 5, 6, 7, and 9 herein.<p>9. Miscellaneous<p>9.1 Construction. <p> In the event that any portion of the TOS is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the invalid or unenforceable portion shall be construed in accordance with applicable law as nearly as possible to reflect the original intentions of the parties, and the remainder of the TOS shall remain in full force and effect.  The paragraph headings herein are provided only for reference and shall have no effect on the construction or interpretation of the TOS.<p>9.2 No Implied Waiver/Modification.  <p>The failure of either party to insist upon or enforce strict performance by the other party of any provision of the TOS shall not be construed as a waiver of any provision or right. Neither the course of conduct between parties nor trade practice shall act to modify any provision of the TOS.<p>9.3 Applicable Law. <p>The TOS shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia, except with regard to its conflicts of law rules.  Each party irrevocably consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the Commonwealth of Virginia and the federal courts situated in the Commonwealth of Virginia in connection with any action arising under the TOS or relating to the AOL Service or AOL Software.  Any cause of action of Member or its authorized user(s) with respect to the AOL Service or AOL Software must be commenced within one (1) year after the claim or cause of action arose, or be barred.<p>9.4 Trademarks. <p>The "America Online(R) Service" is a registered service mark of AOL Inc. "AOL" is a service mark of AOL Inc. All rights reserved.  All other trademarks appearing on the AOL Service are the property of their respective owners.<p>Legal Notices<p>Under California Civil Code Section 1789.3, California Members are entitled to the following specific consumer rights information:<p>1) Pricing Information.<p>Current rates for using the AOL Service may be obtained by calling 1-800-827-6364.  AOL Inc. reserves the right to change fees, surcharges, monthly membership fees or to institute new fees at any time upon thirty (30) days prior notice, as provided for in the TOS Agreement at Section 1.5.<p>2) Complaints.<p>The Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the Department of Consumer Affairs may be contacted in writing at 1020 N. Street, #501, Sacramento, CA 95814 or by telephone at 1-916-445-1254.<p>General<p>A.  These Rules of the Road set forth how America Online, Inc.  ("AOL Inc.") will operate the America Online Service ("AOL Service") and how Members may use the AOL Service. The Rules of the Road also explain many practical aspects of using the AOL Service.  Please read this document carefully and refer to it as often as necessary.  You should also read the Terms of Service ("TOS") Agreement.  This document, the TOS Agreement, and the Membership Conditions (which you saw when you first signed on) are all of the applicable AOL Service rules and collectively comprise the contract between AOL Inc. and Members and are referred to as the "Terms of Service" or "TOS."  You can view all of the TOS on the AOL Service at any time free of charge in the "Members' Online Support" department located within the "Members Services" area.<p>B.  We believe that these Terms of Service will enhance AOL Inc.'s efforts to make the AOL Service informative, entertaining and, above all, FUN!! for all our Members.  We have tried to explain clearly our Terms of Service, but if any aspect of the TOS is unclear, we welcome your comments.  We hope that these Terms of Service will foster an online community where there is both free exchange of ideas and information, and respect for individual and community rights.<p>Access<p>(i) Equipment.  <p>Most Members will access the AOL Service through a standard residential telephone line, a modem, and a personal computer.  (Please remember that when you are connected to the AOL Service, your telephone or other communications equipment, e.g., fax, cannot be operated on the same line at the same time.)  There are a variety of personal computers that are capable of accessing and using the AOL Service.  For specific technical questions, use the keyword "TechLive." Tech Live is currently open weekdays from 9 a.m. to 2 a.m. (Eastern time) and weekends from 12 p.m. to 1 a.m.<p>(ii) Telephone Charges.  <p>You are responsible for all telephone charges incurred in connecting to the AOL Service through the most locally available access number(s) (sometimes referred to as the local access nodes). DEPENDING ON YOUR PARTICULAR LOCATION, THE ACCESS NUMBER IS USUALLY, BUT NOT ALWAYS A LOCAL TELEPHONE CALL. To find additional or closer access numbers use keyword "Access." If you have any questions about which telephone number is best or whether an access number is a local call, please check with your local phone company.  Any disputes or problems regarding phone service are strictly between Member and the applicable local phone company and/or long distance service provider.<p>Please note that AOL Inc. does not maintain the access numbers used to connect to the AOL Service;  rather they are owned and operated by independent network service providers.  MEMBERS ACCESSING THE AOL SERVICE FROM CANADA WILL BE ASSESSED A SURCHARGE, WHICH IS CURRENTLY TWELVE (12) DOLLARS PER HOUR.<p>If you cannot currently find an access number that is a local call, check the "New Access Number Updates," which is updated monthly and available in the free Members' Online Support department.  (We are continuously expanding the list of local numbers.)  You can also call your long-distance telephone company to see if a calling plan is available to allow you to call a long-distance access number for a flat rate, or to purchase blocks of calling time in advance at a discount.<p>Your AOL Service Account<p>(i) YOU MUST BE AT LEAST EIGHTEEN (18) YEARS OF AGE TO REGISTER FOR THE AOL SERVICE AND BECOME AN AUTHORIZED MEMBER; HOWEVER, A PARENT OR LEGAL GUARDIAN MAY AUTHORIZE A MINOR TO USE HIS/HER ACCOUNT(S) UNDER ADULT SUPERVISION. In that case, the parent or legal guardian recognizes that he/she is fully responsible for the online conduct of such minor, for controlling the minor's access to and use of the AOL Service, and for the consequences of any misuse. The AOL Service offers a "Parental Control" feature that enables the Master Account holder to restrict access to certain areas and features on the AOL Service. Please refer to the Parental Control area in the Members' Online Support department for an explanation of this feature.<p>(ii) You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password. For security purposes, we recommend that you change your password often. (You can do this by entering the "Change Your Personal Password" area in the free Members' Online Support department.)  Although the AOL Service offers a feature that allows you to bypass the password protection, please remember that this feature permits anyone who has access to your computer to easily access your account.  Use of this password bypass feature is at your own risk.  YOU ARE FULLY LIABLE FOR ALL CHARGES UNDER YOUR ACCOUNT AND/OR SUB-ACCOUNT(S), INCLUDING ANY UNAUTHORIZED CHARGES TO YOUR ACCOUNT, UNTIL YOU NOTIFY AOL OF ANY BREACH OF SECURITY BY CALLING AOL AT 1-800-827-6364.<p>(iii) Current rates for using the AOL Service may be obtained by using keyword "Billing."<p>(iv) AOL reserves the right to distribute to merchants or third parties certain general Member information, such as Member's name and mailing address, unless Member elects otherwise by selecting the appropriate "Marketing Preferences" choice within the "Personal Choices" area on the AOL Service. AOL will not distribute specific billing information (i.e. credit card and checking account numbers).<p>(v) AOL encourages you to be creative and have fun with the screen names you choose, but you are also expected to be reasonable and responsible; vulgar or otherwise offensive screen names can offend the sensibilities of many Members, and it is only common courtesy to remember this when you are selecting screen names.  You may not use a screen name to impersonate someone, or a name protected by trademark or copyright law.  You may use a name of a historical person, but not of another living person.  If you are unsure about a screen name, send us an E-Mail using the "Write to Terms of Service Staff" button under keyword "TOS," and select the "Names/Profiles Violations" button. Unfortunately, some Members occasionally select vulgar or otherwise offensive screen names as a joke, or just a momentary lapse of good judgment.  AOL Inc. reserves the right to delete any such screen name, or to request deletion.<p>Online Conduct<p>Please refer to Section 2.5 of the Terms of Service Agreement for AOL Inc's policy on impermissible types of online conduct. Below are some common violations of the Terms of Service. This list is not exhaustive.  AOL Inc. reserves the right, but does not assume the responsibility, to restrict communication which AOL Inc. deems in its discretion to be harmful to individual Members, damaging to the communities which make up the AOL Service, or in violation of AOL Inc.'s or any third-party rights. Please be aware, however, that communication over the AOL Service often occurs in real-time, or is posted on one of the AOL Service's thousands of message boards or libraries, and AOL Inc. cannot, and does not intend to, screen communication in advance.<p>If you witness chat in a public chat room that violates AOL's Terms of Service, you may contact an AOL Service Guide by using the keyword "Guide Pager."  You may also contact AOL's Terms of Service Staff about any violation by using the "Write to the Terms of Service Staff" icon located in the Terms of Service area of the Member's Online Support department.<p>Offensive Communication<p>The AOL Service is a community-oriented service composed of many different communities of people.  Our goal is to provide an interesting, stimulating and fun place for all Members. Using vulgar, abusive or hateful language undermines this goal and is not allowed. Please use your best judgment and be respectful of other Members. Remember, there are children online.<p>If you use vulgar, or abusive language online, even if masked by symbols or other characters, you may either receive an "on-screen-warning" by a Guide or Room Host, or in extreme cases be terminated immediately.<p>A warning indicates that your language is not in compliance with AOL Inc.'s Rules.<p>Should you receive such a warning, take the time to read the TOS Agreement again and these Rules of the Road posted in the free Members' Online Support department.<p>Harassment<p>When a Member targets another specifically to cause him/her distress, embarrassment, unwanted attention, or other discomfort, this is harassment.<p>AOL Inc. does not condone harassment in any form and may suspend or terminate the accounts of any Member who harasses others.<p>You may have a disagreement with someone's point of view -- we encourage lively discussion in our chat rooms and message boards -- but personal attacks, or attacks based on a person's race, national origin, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation or other such affiliation, are prohibited.<p>If you have a disagreement with someone's point of view, address the subject, not the person.<p>Graphic Files<p>AOL Inc. prohibits the transfer or posting on the AOL Service of sexually explicit images or other content deemed offensive by AOL Inc.<p>Scrolling<p>"Scrolling" means repeatedly causing the screen to roll faster than Members are able to type to it.  It is caused by a user entering a set of random characters or by repeatedly entering a carriage return or any such action to a similar disruptive effect.  Scrolling is an expressly prohibited form of disruption.<p>Impersonation<p>This can involve the portrayal of an account in an official capacity, such as AOL Inc. staff or an information provider, authorized Guide or Host, or communication under a false name or a name that you are not authorized to use.<p>Members must avoid the portrayal of AOL personnel or other persons in all forms of online communication, including, but not limited to, screen names, member profiles, chat dialogue and message postings.<p>Room DisruptionThis includes purposefully interfering with the normal flow of dialogue in a chat room.  Room disruption may occur by repeatedly interrupting conversation between Members, or by acting in such a way as to antagonize, harass or create hostility in a chat room.<p>Chain Letters and Pyramid Schemes<p>Transmission of chain letters and pyramid schemes of any kind is not allowed on the AOL Service.  This material places an unnecessary load on our mail system and is considered a nuisance by many Members.<p>Certain chain letters and pyramid schemes are illegal.<p>Letters or messages that offer a product or service based on the structure of a chain letter are also of questionable legality. At minimum, they are a waste of resources and are not permitted on the AOL Service.<p>Advertising and Solicitation<p>You may not use the AOL Service to send unsolicited advertising, promotional material, or other forms of solicitation to other Members except in those specified areas that are designated for such a purpose (e.g., the classified area).<p>Internet Access and Conduct<p>The AOL Service will soon feature comprehensive access to the Internet. When using the Internet and all of its components, Members must conduct themselves responsibly according to the Internet's own particular code of conduct. Participating successfully on the Internet is really a matter of common sense. Although AOL Inc. does not control the Internet, your conduct on the Internet when using your AOL account is subject to the Terms of Service. Because AOL Inc. wants to be a good Internet citizen, it prohibits Members from engaging in certain conduct on the Internet through or by means of the AOL Service including the following:<p>(i) Chain Letters.  Chain letters are prohibited on the AOL Service and are inappropriate on the Internet.  Posting a chain letter to an Internet newsgroup (or via E-Mail on the Internet) may result in your AOL Service account being terminated.<p>(ii) Commercial Communication.  The vast majority of newsgroups and mailing lists on the Internet are not commercial in nature and participants in such groups may object strongly to commercial postings, solicitations, or advertisements.<p>(iii) Other Inappropriate Posts.  Each newsgroup and mailing list on the Internet focuses on a particular set of topics and posts not related to these topics are not welcomed by the participants.  We suggest that all AOL Service Members become familiar with the guidelines, themes, and culture of the specific newsgroups and mailing list in which they wish to participate. Posting patently inappropriate material on the Internet may result in suspension or termination of your AOL Service account.<p>(iv) Copyrighted and Proprietary Materials.  Transmitting to the Internet copyrighted or other proprietary material of any kind without the express permission of the right holder is prohibited and will result in termination of your membership and possible civil and/or criminal liability.<p>Additionally, AOL Inc. does not control the Internet and therefore use of the Internet is at Member's own risk.  Members should exercise their discretion and supervision when allowing any minors under their Master Account to access the Internet.<p>Third-Party Content and Information.<p>Because AOL Inc. encourages open and candid communication, it cannot determine in advance the accuracy of Content transmitted on the AOL Service. AOL is not responsible for screening, policing, editing, or monitoring such Content.  If notified of allegedly infringing, defamatory, damaging, illegal or offensive Content, AOL Inc. may investigate the allegation and determine in good faith and in its sole discretion whether to remove or request the removal of such Content from the AOL Service.  AOL Inc. shall be held harmless from any performance or non-performance by AOL Inc. of such activities, as long as it has acted in good faith.<p>Please use your best judgment in evaluating all information contained or opinions expressed on the AOL Service.  You should be at least as careful in your evaluation of such information and opinions on the AOL Service as you are in everyday life.  It is AOL Inc.'s policy not to endorse, oppose, or edit any opinion expressed by a Member or information or material provided by an independent contractor.<p>Independent contractors who supply information or content to the AOL Service ("Information Provider") endeavor to make it accurate and reliable, but do not guarantee or warrant as so.  In some instances, the information provided may represent opinion and judgment and/or may have been supplied by a Member not in any way under a contract with AOL Inc. <p>Purchasing Products and Services through the AOL Service<p>Please remember that AOL Inc. does not endorse, warrant or guarantee any product or service offered through the AOL Service and will not be a party to any transaction between you and third-party providers of products or services.  As with the purchase of a product or service through any medium or in any environment, you should use your best judgment and exercise caution where appropriate.  Blind opportunity ads and "get rich quick" schemes should be approached with ample skepticism.  The AOL Service cannot mediate disputes and cannot assume responsibility for any outcome.  Be careful, be smart, have fun!<p>Public and Private Communication<p>The AOL Service offers Members the capability to communicate in Public Areas generally accessible to other Members or to communicate privately with another Member.  Public Areas are those features that are generally accessible to other Members, such as, but not limited to, chat rooms, online forums, and message boards.  Private Communication is electronic correspondence sent or received by you to particular individuals. AOL Inc. will maintain the AOL Service Public Areas as an open forum for discussion of a wide range of issues and expression of diverse viewpoints. AOL Inc. will administer standards of online conduct according to its TOS for the enjoyment of all its Members. While we will endeavor to monitor the Public Areas to ensure that online standards are being maintained, AOL Inc. has neither the practical capability, nor does it intend, to act in the role of "Big Brother" by screening public communication in advance.<p>It is AOL Inc.'s policy to respect the privacy of personal electronic communication.  AOL Inc. will not intentionally inspect the contents of an electronic message ("E-Mail" or "Instant Message") sent by one Member to another individual, monitor discussions in private rooms, or dislose the contents of any personal electronic communication to an unauthorized third party, except as required or permitted to do so by law.  AOL  Inc. reserves the right to cooperate fully with local, state, or federal officials in any investigation relating to any Content, including private electronic communication, transmitted on the AOL Service or the unlawful activities of any Member.<p>AOL Inc. reserves the right to remove any Content that it deems in its sole discretion to be a violation of its Terms of Service.  AOL Inc. may terminate immediately any Member who misuses or fails to abide by its Terms of Service.<p>AOL, Inc.'s current general practice is that (i)  E-Mail is retained on the AOL Service for five (5) days after the date it is read and then permanently deleted, and (ii)  unread E-Mail is kept on the AOL Service for approximately thirty (30) days;  however, AOL Inc. makes no warranties of any kind with respect to its E-Mail service and is not responsible for any message which may be misprocessed by AOL Inc.  AOL Inc. reserves the right to change its general E-Mail practice at any time without notice.  If a screen name is deleted, any unread E-Mail sent prior to that deletion will also be removed, as a deleted screen name cannot be reinstated.<hr>	<center>		<A HREF="home.html"><IMG ALIGN=bottom border=0 SRC="resources/images/bars/bar_home_small.gif"></A><A HREF="radio.html"><IMG ALIGN=bottom border=0 SRC="resources/images/bars/bar_rad_small.gif"></A><A HREF="computers.html"><IMG ALIGN=bottom border=0 SRC="resources/images/bars/bar_com_small.gif"></A><A HREF="p1p2.html"><IMG ALIGN=bottom border=0 SRC="resources/images/bars/bar_p1p2_small.gif"></A><A HREF="olt.html"><IMG ALIGN=bottom border=0 SRC="resources/images/bars/bar_olt_small.gif"></A><A HREF="webstuff.html"><IMG ALIGN=bottom border=0 SRC="resources/images/bars/bar_web_small.gif"></A><A HREF="personal.html"><IMG ALIGN=bottom border=0 SRC="resources/images/bars/bar_per_small.gif"></A><A HREF="mailto:voxtalent@aol.com"><IMG ALIGN=bottom border=0 SRC="resources/images/bars/bar_email_small.gif"></A><hr>		[<A HREF="home.html">Home</A>] [<A HREF="radio.html">Radio</A>] [<A HREF="computers.html">Computers</A>] [<A HREF="p1p2.html">Press1*Press2</A>] [<A HREF="olt.html">OnLine Today</A>] [<A HREF="webstuff.html">Web Design</A>] [<A HREF="personal.html">Personal</A>] [<A HREF="mailto:voxtalent@aol.com">Mail</A>]		<p>		<IMG ALIGN=bottom SRC="resources/images/headers/dhl_banner.gif">		<KBD>			<br>			All contents copyright &#169;1995 David Lawrence.<br><B>Comments?</B> Use this <A HREF="comments.html">form</a> or send me e-mail at <A HREF="mailto:voxtalent@aol.com">voxtalent@aol.com</A>		</KBD>		<hr>	<A HREF="http://www.pointcom.com"><IMG ALIGN=bottom SRC="resources/images/logos/5percmdt.gif" ALT="Yep, we're a Point Top 5% of All Websites Site!"></A><hr> 	<A HREF="http://www.halsoft.com/html-val-svc/">    <IMG SRC="http://www.halsoft.com/html-val-svc/images/valid_html.mcom.gif"     ALT="HTML HaL Mozilla Checked!"></A>	</center></body></html>

Just fill out this page. Then print it out on your laser printer, and mail it to me at the address below with a stamped #10 envelope or larger (make sure you put at least two 32 cent stamps on your envelope).

They have amassed a huge following inWashington D.C. where they started.  This FAQ hopes to answer some of thequestions raised by the many fans by pooling the combined knowledge of usall.

GeronimoA.K.A. - Mike Sorce  (Real Name)A.K.A. - Donny G  (Mafia Name)A.K.A. - Dick Cheese  (Fake DJ-Puker Name)A.K.A. - Dixon  (Of the Fake Morning-Zoo-Type Team "The Dixons!")Birthday  9/18/58FAMILYPreviously DivorcedEx-Wife  Name DawnDaughter  Name Amy From Previous marriageWife  Name Freda Sorce, married in 1981Son  Name Bart Sorce (Bart named after Bart Starr who visited Donnywhen he was in the hospital as a young lad.)Dog  Name Brandy.  Springer spaniel.  Dumb as a box of rocks.  Likesto eat cat poop and used tampons.  Don thought Brandy was homosexual fora time.Cat  Name Booboo-Kitty.  Died.  Found dead by Big Frieda inbasement.New cat's name is FurballBrother  Name Jim.  Drives a truck.Lives with wife (Angie) and child (Rachel.)Angie works at Frito-Lay.Jim and Angie were married on the show!Aunt  Name Lola.

Lives in Ocean CityMother-In-Law  name "Big" Freda.  Lives in Ocean City.Don has lived most of his life in the Washington D.C. metropolitanarea; specifically in Great Falls, Virginia.  Don't believe him when he sayshe lives in Dale City in the shadow of Potomac Mills.  He has lived in LosAngeles, and Chicago as well.  He spends his time driving his son, Bart, toschool, watching TV on his big Mitsubishi 35" and Direct TV satellite, workingout (mostly by jogging, and fulfilling his marital obligations for a few minutesat a time.  Last reported weight, 218 lbs.Interesting Facts:Longest sustained sexual act: 11 minutesFavorite TV Show: Star Trek: The Next GenerationBelieves God looks like Jean-Luc Picard.

Thumbelina.  Very short (4-10)Understandably, little is really known about Mike O'Meara.  Mike'slife is not nearly the open book that Don's is.  What information does comeout usually does at some protest from Mike.An allumnus of American University, where he admits to have spentmore times behind a beer than behind a book, Mike lives in Annapolis, MDwhere he drives his rich-guy car to Fairfax, VA every day for the show.  Heis married to Laura, a figure skater/Highway-Love-Connection Contestant/Big-Fan.Mike and Laura have a baby!  Conception was on 09/16/94 (announced to us on02/13/95), and was born Katherine Mary O'Meara, 06/09/95 at 5:53 PM.  She weighed in at 7 lbs. 6Oz.He likes watching TV, as Don does, but on his "Rich-Guy" satellite dish insteadof lowly cable (which is in reference to what Don used to have. Don recentlypurchased his dish.)  He also enjoys playing hockey with former WashingtonCapitals where he frequently gets winded, and throws up!Plays golf, and freely admits how mad he can get out on the course, oftenleading to breaking a few in disgust.Depending on his mood, Mike is either on, or off the sauce.Mike also has a new fascination with Value City and IHOP.

He has a speechimpediment.He's about 5'7" tall, with thinning black hair and glasses.  He looks fairlynormal, except for his missing hand.  Dennis is no longer a virgin, although ittook a lot to accomplish this.  He just recently lost his virginity, despiteDon's gift of a trip to a Reno Whore-house in mid 1993.  Don told him to'satisfy himself' before the actual act.  Dennis found, however, that thiscaused him to be, sort of, spent.  Denise (See 4.07) agreed to assist him in "tripping the Light Fantastique"after winning a Strip Trivia game.  She promised Don & Mike that she wouldhelp Dennis out with his little wish, and Don remembered this some time later.He got Denise to make good on her promise, and he lost it on September 181994 at 2:18 PM (eastern).A tape exists of the event, but no one will release it, however, parts wereplayed on the air.4.02  WandaA.K.A.  - DemitriusWanda is a pre-operative transsexual with a very distinctive voice.Loves St. Pauli Girl, and Martinis.

Used to live the rock-n-roll lifestyle.  Wasbackstage at Woodstock, and lived with rock bands, opening for such names asAlice Cooper.  He took far too many drugs in the 60s, and is paying for it nowby going back to school, moving back with his folks, and getting a new career.He Has written "two sides" "to everything" on his sneekers.  Helikes to say "some people wear their heart on their sleves, Iwear my philosophy on my feet."  He made a model of the humaneye, for school, which he brought to a show (at Dianas request).Drives a car with vanity plates "Artist1c"("Artistic licence" -- he's fond of puns).

MIght've had something to do with Shari.  That's notclear.   Stay tuned.  Don and Mike always seem to allow him toreappear from time to time, or whenever he can get on the airhimself. He's a reasonably articulate fellow (having had Lettersto the Editor published in the Washington post four times), butmelts into a a puddle of mumbling, stumbling, un-funnyboorishness  whenever he's in the presenceof Don-n-Mike, (whose greatness intimidates the hell out of him.)      Has bemoaned his recent lack of luck with the ladies (hecalls it his "long coital dry spell -- a term which Don chose notto use) and once said it would probably have been easier if hewas gay.   He wrote long drawn-out letters, begging for Don'sforgiveness, and submits all sorts of weird ideas (like peanut-butter and marshmallow sandwiches, elevator buttons that could bere-pressed to turn off, a contraption which could allow people tohave sex at speeds of hundreds-of-thrusts per minute, 13-manjuries (so one deranged idiot couldn't side-track the wholeprocess -- since a majority of only 12 would still be required),on and on anon ad nausem.

Her name was Lady Cassandra St.John.  This time, Cassandra actually wentthrough with the sex change, going from being a proud man who served to awoman.She is reputed to have flashed D&M in their studio.There was a series of disgusting dates that Don fixed her up with, thenthey introduced her to a lovely lesbian....They had a fever courtship and were married lesbian style on the Don andMike show 23 July 1993...About a month later she had a falling out with Don on the air and Don kickedhim/her off the show because he/she was making appearances on anotherWashington, D.C. radio station.  Cassandra was/is a Wican Priestess. In otherwords, a pagan witch. Her radio exploits, coupled with the revelation that shewas a he made others in her coven insist that she back off on the witchassociation.  So she droppped down from "Lady Cassandra, Witch" to plainCassandra.  She and Francis (See 4.04) have an afternoon show on a small stationin Maryland, discussing various girl-type things.  They bill themselves as"opposites attract" (ie: "Cassandra's Gay, and Francis isn't...Francis likesguys, Cassandra doesn't...But we get along just fine."4.09  <A HREF="http://axsamer.org/wcxs/djinfo/tom_gavin.html">Tom Gavin</A> - click <A HREF="mailto:tom@axsamer.org">here</A> to mail him a message!Tom Gavin, affectionately known as Tommy, called into the Don and Mike showone day, and fast became one of the regulars.  He was first noticed by hisillegible and mispelled faxes, that looked like an elementary school kid wrotethem.  It was only many months later that he actually called and got on theair.  Tom is famous for the phrases "Hey buddy!", "Yep." "How you doin'?" and "How you doin' out deer goiz?"  He has an accent that would be closelyrelated to someone who is mildly deaf or Elmer Fudd. He has a fondness forShari, since he always gets in a few words directed at her when he realizesthat Don and Mike are going to take the hook out of his mouth (hang up on him.)Also, he is a DJ on an FM cable station in Fairfax County.  It is thepublic access station provided by the Cable Company.That frequency is 94.7 (WCSX), which you can listen to if you have an FMsplitter, or you can listen by tuning in channel 37 on Greater Mediacable in Fairfax county.  Don and Mike enjoy playing his DJ tapes, and goofon him as they do with other people who are in their business.  Hefrequently repeats himself on these tapes, and leaves a lot of dead air.There was a "Tom Gavin's DJ Delights", which served the Baltimore/DC area,but I don't know if this is the same Tom Gavin.He also is a terrific speller.  So good, infact, that he only spelled oneword correctly after a few dozen words for him to attempt.  The phoneticsaren't even there.  He will, in most cases, start off spelling a word forDon and Mike, giving the first letter correctly, then completely blowingthe rest of the word.<H4><A NAME="5">5.00  History</H4>Don Geronimo started in radio at 16 years old.  He worked in New Yorkas a DJ making what he thought was good money, had his own place, and'made-it' with teachers who heard his voice on the radio.  He was a smart-assall his life which landed him in trouble, and in-and-out of many radio jobs.He even did it with a midget, which he likes to talk about.  He has been firedfrom some 20 radio stations!  Most of the time, he's been fired for talking toomuch and playing too few songs.  He has DJ'ed in Los Angeles, Chicago (at WLS),New York City, Detroit at WDRQ (for 6 whole weeks!), WNDE in Indianapolis, WPROin Providence RI, and here in Washington on 3 stations; WPGC where he was justDon Geronimo doing his usual top 40 music-show, WAVA where he and Mike O'Mearareplaced Charlie and Harrigan on "The Morning Zoo!" and now WJFK  where theirantics are legendary.Mike O'Meara spent most of his youth sitting in bean-bag chairs inhis parents basement listening to Iron Butterfly, Boston, and Pink Floyd.Later, he found his way into radio where he worked a couple of CountryStations, and eventually, into WAVA in Arlington, Virginia.Don first joined WAVA (Wave-Uh) in '84 where he did afternoon drive.His son Bart was just born, and constantly called home to talk to his wife,Freda, during the show.  Mike worked as, no joke, the Wave-Uh Van-driver.His job was to schlepp the promotions department's van to and fromappearances.  That's where the two met.They used to yukk it up in the hallways of "The Stinky Station," (andmind you, it DID smell bad) so much that the program director decided to canhis Morning Zoo Show with Charlie and Harrigan in favor of Don & Mike.The Morning Zoo show aired from December of 1985 until June of 1992on WAVA.  Although everything stated above is true, Don and Mike love to tell thefollowing story of how they met:Don was being driven home in heavy traffic in his stretch limou, when heheard a familiar voice eminating from the side of the road.  When Donrecognized the voice belonging to the legendary Sammy Davis jr., he toldFrank (his driver) to stop the car!  To Don's surprise, it was NOT thelegend at all, but a guy, smelling of vomet, BO, and anything else youcould imagine.  Don told this man that his impression was fantastic, andasked him if he'd like to work with Don.  The man was so excited that hepuked all over Don, his upholstery, and a brand new pair of shoes Don waswearing.  This guy was Mike O'Meara, of course.The program directors, over the years, always tried to keep atight rein on them.  "Eleven Songs in a row, not ten, not nine, ELEVEN!"  "Tryand keep the recurring bits at the same times during the day.  If you do CrooksAre Stupid at 9:00, ALWAYS do it at 9:00."  At times, Don & Mike would tryand listen and do what they said, but often, they didn't.  They've beensuspended at least twice in my memory.After a while, Don & Mike came to truly despise program directors fortheir meddling - driving some PD's to tears (Li'l Matt Farber, now workingfor MTV.  His handshake is like a dead fish.  He used to take his shoes offduring meetings and rub his toes.)  They even began a love-hate relationshipwith the Vice-President/General Manager Alan Goodman.Big Al (Your Radio Pal), who was also known as "The Jumpin' Munchkin", wasa balding, annoying little guy whoalways gave nicknames to people he worked with.  I remember he used to alwayssay, "Good Morning Dee!  Good Morning Emm!"Don and Mike hated working at that station.  They gave them nolatitude to do what they wanted, even though their ratings were stellar -sometimes commanding upwards of a 13 share!  They had to get out, but theircontract was very binding.  Their frustrations became apparent several timeswhen they have walked out of broadcasts, been suspended, and blatantlyvocalized their unhappiness.  Some of these setbacks caused "rebirths" ofsorts where Don & Mike would go back to their older styles of broadcastingspawning "The NEW Sound of Don & Mike" and crap like that.  One way, oranother, however, Don & Mike were determined to leave WAVA.Emmiss Broadcasting owned WAVA, but came upon some financial troublein 1992.  Finally, it was reported that WAVA was up for sale.  Salembroadcasting, a Christian Radio organization, bought out the station almostimmediately, but assured the on-air talent that their jobs were assured inthe reorganization.  Even though, Salem didn't own any Top-40 radio stations,they still pretended that they wouldn't change the format to religeous.Well, that was Don & Mike's cue to get out.  They were given offersfrom other radio stations, including Chicago and LA.As an aside comment, when WAVA was being sold, Don and Mike had a job offerfrom KLOS in Los Angeles.  The boys turned it down because they wanted tostay in the Washington, DC area.  They thought that the problems with WAVAwould clear up, and things would be back to normal.  Since they weren'tgoing to take the job, some radio guy (assuming he worked for KLOS at thetime) wanted Don and Mike to hear a few DJ airchecks.  The idea was to gettwo guys who sounded like Don and Mike.  So they both listened to thetapes, and picked a real winner (in true Don and Mike style, of course.).It was so bad that, as a joke, Don and Mike said that they would be perfectfor the job.  This was done purely as a goof.  These two radio guys whichDon and Mike picked to take the LA job were none other than Mark and Bryan.I have no idea how they became number one in LA, but they did.  At least,until Howard Stern kicked them off the top spot.  That makes me happy,since I like Howard as well, but that's just my opinion.  They were made an offer from WJFK andInfinity broadcasting whereas they would buy out Don & Mike's contracts.Things weren't all rosy at WJFK, either.  Not long before theirchange-over, their producer, Frank Murphy, booked Leslie Nielson for theshow.  At the last minute, Leslie's publicist backed out without explanation.Don & Mike proceeded to rip into Leslie's publicist to the point where shefiled a $15 Million lawsuit against Emmis Broadcasting, Don, Mike, andFrank.  The lawsuit followed them to WJFK where it ended in an undisclosedsettlement.Then, finally, in 1993, Don & Mike were syndicated by Infinity.<H4><A NAME="6">6.00  Mike O'Meara's Voices</H4>6.01  Charly StuangstabilacCharly was born, 42 years old, on the anniversary of D&M's first showtogether, December 15, 1985.  Now, turning 51, he's still one of the mostpopular characters on the show.  He is described as 6'5", 250lbs, Mr.Clean-bald, and wears Bib-overalls.  He lives in Gaithersburg where he sharesa duplex with his brother Matthew, and his friend Huggybear.  If anybody hasever seen Full Metal Jacket, and remembers the character of 'Private Pyle,'can imagine what Charly looks like.Charly was married to Baklava Souvlaki, a woman he met at the Nut-Hutseveral years ago.  Their sex-life was reported as amazing.  Charly andBaklava, eventually, split up, but not without producing his only son, CharlyJr.  Charly Jr. grew up unbelievably quickly, and immediately attended somemilitary academy.  Charly and Baklava have since patched things up, but wehaven't heard from her in quite some time.  Incedentally, Baklava's voice wasmasterfully created by our own Diana Silman.  Charly also has a sister,Charlene, with whom Charly does not get along with.  Charlene's voice isperformed by Sherri Liquor.  Even though Charly is 52, Mike seems tomis-calculate all the time.  Don asks, "Charly, how old are you again?"  ButCharly can never get it right, always being off by a few years.  Maybe heshould just say he's 39, eh?Charly has starred in his own hit-TV show on Fox called,appropriately, "Charly's Place."  He has held down several jobs includingvarious duties at Don's house, construction worker, janitor, privateinvestigator, ice-cream taster, highway-maintenance engineer, and was also anurse for the used-to-be fattest man in the world "Hambone."  Consideringhis extensive resume, you would never think that Charly hasn't yet graduatedfrom Gonzaga High-School in downtown Washington, DC.6.02  My Cousin LuigiDon's cousin Luigi came over from Italy just a couple of years ago,and hasn't yet picked up the language.  Although, if you listen carefully,you might pick out the gist of what he's saying.  By far, the funniest voicein Mike's repertoire.6.03  Buddy SurrellFrom the Dick VanDyke show, Buddy needs a squeegee to wipe his face whenhe's  done talking.  He always has Vietnam flashbacks, and can never rememberwho he's talking to after coming out of them..6.04  Raymond BurrBig Ray is well known for his Ironsides role, as well as hispreoccupation with chocolate (See 7.00.)6.05  Telly SavalasWho loves ya, Telly?

Usually accompanies Don's Richard Dryfuss' "CALL 911!!"6.09  Lucille BallSometimes, this voice is rehashed for any female heavy-smoker.Smokes menthols.6.10  Ken BeatriceWMAL (AM-630, in Washington, DC) radio sports-talk DJ.  Very funnyvoice, if you have ever heard Ken's show.  Always ends up the same way, "BYE,NOW!!"6.11  Joe JacobyPumpkin-head Joe, former Washington Redskin, is so large that theRedskins had to contract out to get a helmet built for his super-sized head.No - No - No - Yeah!  My wife enjoys them!  I'm turning into Frankenstein!6.12  Elvis Aaron PresleyBack when Don&Mike and Major Bill Smith were having a bit of a tiff,Mike was working on his INCREDIBLE Elvis voice.  Elvis had apparently calledD&M through the Major, and sounded slurred, and slow.  Mike picked up on itimmediately (See 7.06.)6.13  Major Bill SmithWell, y'all know the Maj's on the level.  Another greatMike-voice.  Likes to eat Corn on the Cob, spam and German Potato Salad!6.14  Alan GoodmanVP/General Manager (former) of WAVA-FM 105.1 in Washington, DC.Flawless, and always funny.  Did some classic bits including the string of"Alan Goodman" movies:  'Goodman: The Movie", "Goodman: The Lucky Man","Goodman: The Prophecy", and "The Last Temptation of Alan Goodman."  (See 5.00.)6.15  Rusty FordFormer production director of WAVA.  Has to be heard to be believed.Because nobody knows who Rusty is, anymore, Mike doesn't do the voice.  Butwhen he did it, it was GREEAAAAAAT!6.16  Maurice ButkusNo longer a voice used by Mike.  Maurice appeared as the sportsreporter for Don & Mike at WAVA.  He was very effeminate, and blatantly ahomosexual character.  It was decided that Maurice had to go as to not createanimosity from the homosexual audience.  Also doubled as the fashionreporter.6.17  Rush LimbaughThis impersonation has actually gotten rave reviews from the 'rhoidsufferer, himself!  Always suffering from 'inflamed hemmerhoidal tiss-yooo,'this man frequents the D&M airwaves.  Rush must sit on a donut for comfort.6.18  RobBay SpiewakUncanny!  Even Rob's grandfather can be fooled!  Loves his KrispyKreme donuts with raspberry filling.  (see 3.02)6.19  Hop-SingAnother great stereotypical voice, Joe!  Loves that gong, and doesDon's laundry.  He is always interested in "sex book, Joe?"6.20  StimpyNot the cartoon character, but one of the former employees of WJFK, where D&Mbroadcast. His most famous line: THAT'S B.S. ROB! It's HOT HOT HOT!6.21  Forrest GumpNot a very good impression, but funny!

Is Don's boyhood idol.),Bullethead (Gordon Liddy), Floyd the Barber, Suzanne Pleshette, Fabio, MichaelEisner, Kate Mulgrew, (Capt. Janeway from Star Trek:Voyager) who has a fascinationwith "Polaric Radiation", Cerf (way too mellow DJ that worked with Don & Mike atWAVA and WJFK) and Mr. Cartoon (which always gives Mike a migrane while doing it.)<H4><A NAME="7">7.00  (In)Famous Stories</H4>7.01  Raymond Burr StoryDon and Mike have a friend in the law enforcement community thatraids and seizes photographs of people in 'peculiar circumstances.'  One ofthe photos showed a much younger Raymond Burr lying on the floor with ayounger man squatting under him doing his business IN RAY'S MOUTH!  Hence,his fascination for 'chocolate.'Wharff!7.02  Danny Thomas StoryD&M always refer to him and glass table-tops, and give away the word 'COPROPHELIA.'For those who have not looked up the word, the long and short of it is, acopropheliac enjoys fecal matter.  As for what "Eggs, Danny-Thomas-Style"are, I couldn't hazard a guess..  He enjoyed watching people do their businesson glass table tops while he was lurking underneath.<A NAME="lola">7.03</A>  Aunt Lola StorySuffice to say, Don's Aunt Lola was a bit drunk at a familygathering, and cornered a teenage Donny in a walk in-closet, and gave him thetongue.  Aunt Lola died of a liver disease.<A NAME="uncle">7.04</A>  Don's UncleDon's mother had a baby but then gave it to her mother (Don'sgrandmother) and she raised him, so Don's Uncle is really his half-brother.His family tried to hide it from him, but couldn't.  Don is now going todivorce his parents because they won't fess up to the information Don hasfigured out...7.05  Superjock StoryLarry Lujack worked at WLS in Chicago with Donny when he was about16 years old.  Lujack had a bit of an attitude, and a huge ego.  He woulddemand that the staff, including Don, call him Superjock.  Also, after-hours,the DJ had the 'buzzer-button' to let people in and out of thebroadcast-building.  So, the story goes, one evening, Larry Lujack, a bunchof Engineers, and Donny were working in the Air-Studio, when Don decided toleave.  When he got to the door, he realized that it was locked.  He lookedinto the security camera and said, "Hey, Larry, let me out!"  Out came a DJPuker voice, "Not until you refer to me as Superjock."  Don huffed, anddecided he would wait.  Well, Don waited for about 2 1/2 hours before hefinally gave in, and called Loojack "Superjock."  As it turns out, it was only15 minutes before another jock relieved Larry, and he pointed out that Don couldhave waited, and that guy would've let him out.  Needless to say, he was laughedat for being so stupid as to not figure that out.  Since then, Don has told thestory many times, including when Don & Buzz (Then Mike Ellston --Hey, anotherDon & Mike Show?!) worked with Lujack, and was actually threatened  with alawsuit to stop telling the story.7.06  Major Bill (R.I.P.) and ElvisMajor Bill Smith (God rest his soul) believes that Elvis is alive,or at least, that's what he'll tell you.  In truth, Don and Mike have beenable to weasel it out of him that he really doesn't believe the big E'salive at all.  He has appeared on numerous talk-shows including D&M's, JoneRivers' and Geraldo Rivera's.Once, Major Bill had someone, whom he believed was the real Elvis,call Don & Mike.  Neither of them really believed it was him, but Mike pickedup on the phony-Elvis's voice, and called Major Bill back pretending to beElvis.  He actually got the ol' Maj to believe that it was really him!  Thatwas the cause of one of the first real fights D&M and Major Bill got into.Lately, however, Major Bill seems to be being taken advantage of bysomeone he calls "The Kid."  It seems that the ol' Maj has been sending moneyto Elvis through The Kid -- about $100,000 a YEAR for the past few years.Don and Mike wanted to put a stop to this immediately, and was able toconvince Major Bill to stop it.  It's too bad there will be no more.7.07  Why Frieda has all the money (The Porsche Story)Back in LA when Donnie was beginning his "big-time" radio career at KIIS-FM,Don used to have to drive this stinking moped to and from home and theradio studio.  He got a bit caught up in the LA lifestyle, and decided hewould go out to a dealership and buy a great big Porsche.  Unfortunately, hewould have to try and keep it a secret from his wife because she wouldn't likehim spending that kind of money.  Infact, they didn't have that kind of moneyto spend.  So, Don used to park about a mile away from his house, and drivethe moped home.  Well, Frieda caught him getting into (or out of, Iforget) the Porsche, and demanded an explanation.  They argued ratherheatedly, and decided they would try and take the car back.Donnie and his child bride drove the Porsche back to the dealershipwhere the salesmen greeted him with "Hey, Donnie!  How's the car, eh?"Don, sheepishly, passed the keys over to them and said, "I can't keep thecar.  I'm giving it back."  The sales guys laughed nervously and replied,"You can't do that.  It's yours!"So, they sued 'im!7.08 The Pat Benetar StoryBack in 1979 Pat Benetar was on a record tour promoting her latest.According to Don, they met one night in a limo with Charlie Kendal, she started to kiss him, and basically, Don gave her the "Thebest night of her life."Cerf (a way too mellow, fellow DJ that worked at WAVA and WJFK) also had a wild bout of sex with Pat, but that did not occur until later.Don found out about it later when Cerf overheard Don talking about it and commented that he had also performed the dirty deed.All of this was flatly denied by Ms. Benetar when she called to promote a concert recently.7.09 Lauren TewesAh, but if we only had the time...The following is scrapped together from discussions on alt.fan.don-n-mike. Mostly from MartinB:Apparently Don was invited to a party at Lauren Tewes' house (he was livingin L.A. at the time.) If I'm not mistaken he was at a ball game (baseball) at the time and left his car at the stadium to go to the party. Once he got there he found himself surrounded by "Hollywood types" including Lauren Tewes who is (was) a coke-head. There were drugs all over the house...mounds of coke on the coffee table etc and Don got so freaked out by it that he hitthe door running and didn't slow down 'til he found a pay-phone and calledFrieda to come and rescue him.          <H4><A NAME="8">8.00  Terms and Definitions</H4>8.01  DBR  - Deep ball rub8.02  Jag  - From the football team "The Jaguars."  Don thoughtit sounded like a cool put down, i.e. "You Jag-off!"8.03  Jagillooly  - Perturbation of Jag (See above) and Jeff Gillooly.Another put down.8.04  Photo-mat  Said when the boys are looking at pretty girls, or are inan uncomfortable situation.8.05  Beve  - Italian for 'Drink!'  Used by RobBay.8.06  "Your finger smells like butt!"Mike had, in his sleep, scratched himself in the itchy eye (See 8.10), and thenext morning, Mike affectionately stroked fiance' (now wife) Laura's hair.  Shemade the initial exclamation.8.08  "Paint your Bald Spot?"A classic tape from the Larry King radio show where a listener asked about oneof his TV appearances where he interviewed John Candy, and he had less hairthan in a more recent interview.  The caller repeated the question over andover until, finally, Larry couldn't take it anymore.  "Aah, sick!"  Heexclaimed.8.09  "I'm a PRO-FESSIoNAL!  Look it up in the book!"Another classic tape from Larry King.  If you haven't heard it, tape theCavalcade of Comedy (network listeners may hear it at the top of the show.Locals will have a better chance at hearing it between 2:00 & 2:30.)Unbelievable!  The tape was made by Aquaman of local DC station WHFS who did itmany years ago, and mixed in some music from Planet of the Apes for dramaticeffect.  It has spawned many quips that you might hear anytime in the show,such as "I'm lost..", "It's way up there..",  and "..and don'tworryabouttheclub..",a slur that is almost unintelligible.And now, the complete transcript, and <A HREF="resources/sounds/au/kingrave.au">sound</A>, of the now infamous tape of Larry King!<h4><center>The Larry King Rave Out</center></h4><BLOCKQUOTE>I got one more question, ah I'm a student of print journalism, and I justwanted to know, ah, what advice do you have for ah ah young people comingup into the field.

I'm talking about journalism field.I'm lost, what do you mean?J-Journalism.  I'm like..I'm I'm a student of Journalism at a college.  And Iwas just wondering the most important aspect of getting into journalism.Not the medical field.  I think you're exhausted from thirty nights.I am exhausted after thirty nights.  No no person, even those of us who aresuperhuman.  Even those of us with ah herculean appetites for the diverseand the bizarre.  Even those of us who ah, who've shown an aptitude to ah..to aaaaaahhh..fight the good fight, and stay the good long battle.  Eventhose of us can get tired.

Probably can guess, how-ever if you imagine D&M laughing at somebodyasking to have his itchy-eye scratched.(Refers to scratching your anus. A sign ofbeing old or having bad hygene)  We all do it at some point.8.11  TeabaggingThis refers to oral sex.  Dipping ones balls in someone's mouth.  Kind of likethe motion that a teabag would make, the balls being the teabag itself.8.12  QueegRefers to G. Gordon Liddy."Queeg" was the name of the Captain of a U.S. destroyer/minesweeper inthe film "The Caine Mutiny."  He's played by Humphrey Bogart, and this isa classic movie, well worth watching.  Basically, Queeg is animcompetent, paranoid nut case, who gets the ship into danger so the crewhas to mutiny.Don & Mike refer to Liddy as "Queeg" because he talks a little bit likethe character, and apparently has over-reacted in a big way to some oftheir antics.  Watch the movie and all will become clear.<H4><A NAME="9">9.00  Games People Play / Recurring Bits</H4>9.01  Low Budget Jeopardy!Opening:"And now it's time for everybody's favorite feature 'LowBudget Jeopardy!'  And now, I'd like to open the door to see which one ofMike's psychotic personalities will be the announcer.."Door opening sound, and Mike's alter ego comes in.  Long discourseusually follows, and then commercial break.Mike's alter ego will say, "Now entering the studio is" contestant1's occupation, and city of residence.  "Please say hi to " name ofcontestant 1.  Repeats for contestant 2.  "And now entering the studio isthe host of Low Budget Jeopardy, and remember DON'T SCREW WITH LQ!  Let'shave a big hand for Alex Trebec Geronimo!"Contestants make usual greetings.Don goes over the rules of the game which include, "Always call meAlex, or as we're playing the game, call me LQ - Lord Quizmaster, alwayscall him " Mike's alter ego's initials, unless otherwise stated.Rules:Two players call in, one is chosen to start off with the firstanswer, unless one is a girl to whit LQ uses the "We like girls more thanboys, so you get to go first" clause.The first player chooses a category.  There are 5 categories with 3answers in each.  Each player, once a category is chosen, MUST complete theentire category before going on to another category.  This is more for LQ'ssanity than anything else.Once the category is chosen, the dollar amount is chosen.  The dollaramounts go from $1 to $2 to $3.  Again, LQ's rules state that the player mustgo from the lowest to highest dollar amounts so as to not confuse LQ.  Theanswer is given by LQ, and the player must come up with the question matchingthe answer.Example:  The category is Celebrity Bra Sizes.  The question is 'HollyHunter."  The player must respond with "What is 34B?"The player MUST state his/her response in the form of a question.Otherwise, the response is ignored, and the second player has a chance tosteal.  To steal the right to choose the next answer, and to win the dollaramount of the category, the first player must answer incorrectly, AND thesecond must answer correctly.When all of the categories are depleted, the scores are tabulated,and the game moves to final jeopardy.  Here, LQ "physically forces [theplayers] to bet it all.."  The players are given a category and a singleanswer.  The players are then given about 30 seconds to come up with thecorrect question, again, in the form of a question.LQ, then wishes them good luck, and puts the contestants on hold,where someone answering the phones will take down the contestants' answers,and relay them on paper to LQ.  Meanwhile, Mike's alter ego tells theaudience what the losers will receive as a consolation prize.  Usuallysomething bogus like 'Rush Limbaugh's Rush to Excellence Suppositories.'Then, he will announce, "Back to Low Budget Jeopardy with Alex TrebecGeronimo."LQ will bring the contestant back where they will give theirresponses on the air.  The responses MUST match what they gave the phonescreeners moments ago, or they will be disqualified.  A correct answer willdouble the cash score, an incorrect answer will knock the player down to zero.The player with the highest dollar value will win, and have $25 addedto their score.  The loser will receive many other gifts which Mike's alterego will announce - each item separated by "But wait..there's more" fromLQ.  In the event of a tie, both players will return during the next game fora rematch.  The players will both get to keep their winnings.  In the eventboth players are knocked down to zero, then two new LBJ contestants will bechosen for the next game.The loser is always asked to "Don't go away mad, just go away."9.02  The Grey Poupon GameA player on the car phone must pull along side someone else inanother car, and ask them, while on the phone AND on the air, the following:"Pardon me, but would you have any Grey Poupon?"The player must speak THOSE words exactly.  Any deviation counts as adisqualification.  If the respondent replies with "But of course.." then theplayer wins a valuable prize.9.03  Honk For CashThe dreaded words 'Honk For Cash' are feared because the game rarelyworks out.  The player must have a car phone, AND A CAR, The player pullsinto a 'Left Turn Only' lane with a light.  The effect is best if the playeris the first or second person in line at the light, and during heavy traffic.Once the light has turned green, the player must put his phoneoutside his car window, and sit silently for 30 seconds.  For everyaggravated honk heard on the phone, the player usually gets cash.If the player speaks during those 30 seconds, or is otherwise deemedas a fraud, he is disqualified.9.04  What My Wife Doesn't Know Won't Hurt HerThis game has been modified, depending on sex, to include "What MyHusband Doesn't Know Won't Hurt Him."  Players call in with deep dark secretsthat they haven't told their respective spouses, yet.  Those with the darkestand juiciest stories get to call their spouses, and tell the story.  Usually,big arguments arise, which makes great radio.9.05  Can You Get To Ten?One of the greatest games ever created.  Don and Mike come up with 10big lies that the players have to tell, on the air, to their parents.  Theplayers must go from the first lie in order to the last.  If the parentbelieves him or her, the player wins.An example game would have lies similar in style to the following:1  Oh a whim, decided to take a flight to Las Vegas.2  Once there, I thought I might go out for a few drinks3  You won't believe it, Wayne Newton was there!4  He was falling down drunk.5  We got to talking, and really struck up great conversation.6  He passed out!7  I decided to drive him back to his hotel8  When we got there, he came to, and invited me into his hot tub.9  We got in the tub, together.10 We had glorious three-way sex.The game is especially funny if the contestant is male.  Also, D&Mhave been known to drag out the comedic value of the bit by not getting backon the phone, and letting the parent know that this was all staged.9.06  The Donny CountdownThere's a little radio station playing inside Don's head, and sincethere aren't any Radio Stations in Washington DC that play any good musicconsistently, Don comes up with what he believes are the top 20 songs of thetime period (Week, Day, whatever).  Hosted by Donny, Buzz, Sherri, andanother Mike O'Meara Personality.  Rush Limbaugh makes a good guest-host.9.07  RobBay Dials for TransvestitesMr. Spiewak calls 1-900 numbers, usually Hot-Transvestite numbers,and pretends he's a pre-operative transsexual named 'Delores.'  Deloresdoesn't like being laughed at.  Probably, the funniest bit to date!9.08  Charly-gramsOnly as Charly can, Charly will call somebody during a specialholiday, usually at the request of a listener, and wish them a HappyBirthday, or other festive greeting.  A mere description does not give thisbit justice!  It is another must-hear!9.09  Who Would You Do?Someone would ask the men in the room, or on the phone, if they couldonly have sex with one or another of two or more choices, which would youchoose.  i.e. Who would you do, Rosanne or Delta Burke?  The answer, Rosanne,of course..9.10  The Phonebooth ChallengeDon would announce the location of a phone booth in a couple ofcities, and call them several minutes later.  The location (city) with themost people congregated at a single phone booth will win valuable prizes.9.11  Phonebooth OlympicsContestant will wait at a predetermined phonebooth for Don & Mike tocall.  Don would then point out the location of another phonebooth close by,and have the contestant sprint over to the other location - sometimes SEVERALlocations.9.12  Portable Phone DestructionContestant would try and find the most entertaining method ofdemolishing his/her portable phone.  The destruction with the most'character' wins valuable prizes.  Good contestants have driven cars overthem, burned them with kerosene, smashed them with hammers, sawed them inhalf with power-saws, ran over them with lawnmowers, but the best one was aguy who swallowed his phone! (headset phone and he had to guzzle pepto-bismolto get it to go down)9.13  Spoons in the DryerContestants are encouraged to put many NOISY things in thedryer, sometimes, even their phones.  The dryer with the most interestingsounds crashing through them wins!  Good contestants have had shards ofglass, spoons, and bowling balls in the dryer.9.14  Send us your Balls!Double Entendre for contestants to send Don & Mike their golf-balls,beachballs, soccer balls, etc. with their names, addresses and so on fordrawings for valuable prizes.9.15  The Don & Mike BowlWas flag football for charity (the Have a Heart Campaign forabused kids) with former and current Redskins.  Last year raised $50,000,and this year was softball because Don broke his hand (FINGER!), anddoesn't wanna get hurt.9.16  Eat the Apple Game!One of D&M's famous bits that can only be done successfully onlocation.  Couples are chosen out of the audience, and the female(usually) places an apple, WEDGES it, you know, right THERE!  The male,usually, gets down on his knees and munches on the apple all the wayaround.  The couple with the quickest 'eat' wins a valuable prize.9.17  Home-Made jingle contest!Listeners are encouraged to send in jingles and D-n-M judge them andpick the best.  To the winner goes a thousand dollars.  There have been threeso far and they were great.  You can hear old entries in the cavalcadesome days.9.18  Highway Love ConnectionSomeone, usually with a celluar phone (D&M will let someone slide on apayphone depending on their mood), will go to a disclosed/popular locationlooking for love.  The caller will give their description of themselves,including their likes/dislikes/personality/occupation/the type of personthey're looking for, etc.  The idea is for someone to listen for the location,and if they like what they hear, they will go and meet the caller.  D&Mwill usually give them a dinner together, and some cheesy outing.  Some ofthese dates have been successful.9.19  Slam-O-RammaRelated to "Spoons in the dryer" (See 9.13).  The object of the game isnoise, noise, and more noise.  A caller will be sure to have lots of itemsin his refridgerator, items which will make a lot of noise.  A good examplewould be glass bottles, or anything breakable..  The person with the loudestsound will win.  D&M will go for the breakage sound.  One guy from KS made hisfridge shudder, shake, rattle and roll for 14.9 seconds.  Although most thinkit was a fake, I guess it's possible if you repeatedly slam the door.9.20 The Vibrator OlympixThis is a game where women call up, hoping to impress Don and Mike with thesound of their vibrator.  The caller is usually asked what the name of thevibrator is.  Sometimes, men will call up with their partner's vibrator.Don and Mike usually speculate that it is really the man's vibrator, butthat he won't admit it.  The object is to find the mostloud/annoying/interesting vibrator sound.  This person usually wins thisparticular contest.9.21  The "My Two Dicks" songDon wrote this after talking about the Bewitched television, show, StarringDick Sargeant and Dick York as Daren Stevens.  It'll make sense as you readthem.Sung to the theme to BEWITCHEDThey're my two Dicks, oh yes they're my two DicksFirst there was York, such a dickThen I changed to Sergeant, hey what a trickI love two Dicks, they're great to have aroundI'm always smiling -- with two Dicks why frown?I'm the witch with the most fun -- can't you seeJust one more Dick--and I'd have threeThey're my two Dicks, oh yes they're my two DicksAnd come what may, I'm proud to tell you thisI'd pass on a love-filled night with the New York Knicks'Cause I'm the witch with two dicks!9.22  Strip TriviaOne of the most beloved games that Don & Mike play.  In this game, the boys trollthe phones for contestants.  They will break in to whatever they're doing totake calls from women, but will take 5 seconds to fill up the roster of men forthe game.  Once assembled in the studio, Don will read questions out of TheTrivial Pursuit book.  The women are ,of course, in the studio with the boys,while the men go over to Buzz's studio with Robbay.  Everyone is introduced tothe listening audience, and then the game begins!Each member has to have five articles of clothing on to start.  As Don asksquestions, people will remove clothing depending on whether the answer iscorrect or not.  If it is, the next person will get a shot.  If it isn't, thenthat person must remove one article of clothing.  The object of the game is tokeep going around until all the people are naked except the one person who isleft clothed.  That is your winner.  All the naked people must run out of theroom to the tune of some sexy sauntry music, where their close await them.During the game, the boys are treated to women doing the "bra thing/trick",while the men (also viewing the nudity of the opposite sex) will be sprayedwith Lysol as they take their clothes off.  The idea is that men really stink,so it is needed.  Robbay usually handles the spraying duties.  Sometimes, thewomen do little dances/flashes for the guys as they are either leaving the room,or while they are topless.  Some of the women are comfy with their nudity,thus will hang around for a few extra seconds.  All the testosterone in thebuilding (as well as listening to the radio) always enjoys this.  (Fill up thebathtub!)  Other times, Don & Mike will not get to look at all because the womenrun out of the room so fast to pick up their clothing.  (What a shame!)9.23  The I Love You Drive-through GameEach car phone contestant must drive through a fastfood drive-through window, andall they are allowed to say is, "I love you!"  If the person on the other endresponds with, "I love you, too!", then you will win.9.24  Bitch, bitch, bitch!Look out guys!  After hearing this game, you'll wonder where your gun is to avoidthat kind of commotion about you by your SO.Don & Mike get women to call and bitch about their husband/boyfriend.  The bestbitch wins.  (enuff said.)9.25  It's all RelativePeople call up and answer questions posed by the boys about the caller's relative.They then call the relative in question, and if that relative answers/matcheswhat the callers' responses were, he/she wins.9.26  The Bark-off for CashSimply put, Don & Mike get the owners of dogs to call up and make their dogsbark.  $1 per bark will be had, and the caller with the most barks will winthe amount of barks combined.9.27  Yo-Ho, Momma!A caller will give D&M a number of their Mom (or whom ever may answer the phone),and all the caller is allowed to say is, "Yo-Ho, Momma!" (or whatever D&M tellthem to say.  The object is to keep the person called on the phone for 60 seconds.If they hangup, then you lose.  If D&M are amused, they may keep you going for 5 minutes before they break into let you know that y9u were successful.9.28  Kill, Maim, or TortureSimilar to the above game.  A caller will tell D&M whom they'd love to kill,maim or torture in their family.  D&M then call a relative and pose the samequestions.  If the relatives' answers/responses match, then the game is won.9.29  Guess The WhoopieD&M ask a caller "When was the last time your parents made love/filled theirmarrital obligations?"

The contestant drives up to a bank with aDrive-Up and a pneumatic tube (it's really important, and someone usually tries to do it with aDriveUp drawer). The contestants tells the teller what's going on, that they are going to send theirphone through the tube and to say "Hello" when the phone gets there. The real trick is that the phonehas to stay on-line (so to speak). We are treated to the sound of the phone being beaten to a pulpby the journey, and the waves of static that are generated from all of the metal and machinery.<H4><A NAME="10">10.00  Other Information</H4>10.01  Contacts1-800-636-1067 STUDIO1-800-636-6410 FAX1-703-691-1607 INFO LINE1-703-691-1900 Switchboard to WJFK.

I GREW UP IN FAIRFAX VA ANDAM A TOTALLY LOYAL "BM" LISTENER.  WHEN ALL OF MY "FRIENDS" SWITCHED TO THEGREASEMAN AND LATER HOWARD STERN AS THEY GOT OLDER, I STUCK WITH THE BOYSTHROUGH IT ALL, AND THEN DELIGHTED WHEN THEY WERE PUT ON IN THE AFTERNOONSON WJFK.

CONTRARY TO WHAT THEY'D HAVE YOUBELIEVE, I GEW UP TOTALLY NORMAL AND WELL ADJUSTED DESPITE HAVING LISTENEDTO THEM DAILY FOR ALL MY YEARS GROWING UP.  I EVEN GRADUATED VALEDICTORIANFROM ROBINSON HIGH SCHOOL IN '91, AND THEN VALEDICTORIAN FROM MY UNDERGRADAT THE CLEVELAND INSTITUTE OF MUSIC (A CLASSICAL MUSIC CONSERVATORY) IN'95.  I WAS DISTRAUGHT WHEN I HAD TO LEAVE D.C. FOR COLLEGE BECAUSE ITMEANT HAVING TO MISS D&M,BUT WAS ECSTATIC WHEN THEY WERE PUT ON WERE 1300 AND EVEN GOT TO BE ON(SIGH, WISH FULFILLMENT) TWICE THE PAST YEAR.

One of my good friends is Big Don O'Brien (of Brian and O'Brien fame) and through him, I got to meet the Don in the D & M show. Anyway, Big Don and I lived in Ocean City for a while, where I was his trusty radio sidekick/monkeyboy/roommate at 95.9 The Coast. He would always talk about Buddy the Parrot, at least, when he wasn't smoking a cigarette.When the two Dons and I were sitting on the beach this summer, with the young Bart in the background, they started laughing about Buddy the Headless Parrot. Both Dons had tears in their eyes.When Don G. got off vacation, Big Don called into the D&M show, and they laughed about Buddy AGAIN. Here's the problem--all I know of this story is that some damned parrot lost his widdle head. Do you have any information that could help me out? Big Don won't tell me anything, except listen to D&M around Christmas.Any info/related stories/juicy dirt would be greatly received.Raymond L.

I have lots of sympathy for you! I don't think people realizewhat dogfood is really made of.

It stated "chicken part". Well that definitely falls under the category of chicken parts. But don'tworry Don, our dog "Tippy" lived for 17 years. That's 119 to you andme.

        anywhere. The Pharmacist at the Professional Compounding

        &quot;&#133;..when one cannot swallow pills or capsules,
        it gets very difficult to take medication. I was so sick
        and the medication I was to take was available in tablet
        form only. My Doctor told me to check with the
        Professional Compounding Pharmacy to see if the
        pharmacist could make the medication into a liquid so I
        could swallow it. I called the pharmacist and he told me
        of course they could. I was able to take the exact
        medication my Doctor ordered for me and swallow it. It
        even tasted good. Thank-you, Professional Compounding
        Pharmacy.<br>

        changed the flavor of my son&#146;s antibiotic to

        prescription for a medication that I needed. When I went
        to the pharmacy it was the exact color that I was
        allergic to. I asked the pharmacist if it was available
        in a different color. He said &quot; no that it only came
        that way.&quot; I did not know what to do. I knew that I
        needed that exact medication but without the dye and that
        my Doctor wanted me to start taking it right away. The
        pharmacist suggested I contact the Professional

        Eleven tablets at one time. Some were the same but he had
        to take several of them to get the amount that he needed
        to take. By the time he swallowed all of them he was
        almost always ready to vomit. The Pharmacist at the
        Professional Compounding Pharmacy suggested that they
        make capsules of the eleven tablets that my brother was
        taking so he would not have to take so many at once. The
        pharmacist was able to reduce the number he had to take
