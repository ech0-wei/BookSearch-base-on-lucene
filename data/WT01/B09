<FONT SIZE="4" FACE="MS Serif" COLOR="Navy">Introduction:</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3" FACE="MS Serif" COLOR="Navy">I am pleased to be back with PLI to discuss the direction of the Administration's export control program.  We have a lot to discuss, so I'll get right into it.<P>

When I spoke to you last year, I mentioned the turning point for our nation's future -- the shift with the end of the Cold War to identifying national security with global economic competitiveness.  In that regard, nothing I said last year has changed.  That shift continues, and the Clinton Administration remains sensitive to it.  But we also have to move beyond it and look ahead at the kind of world we face in the future. <P> 

First, however, I would like to recap the last several years of accomplishments, give you an idea of what we are currently working on, and then lay out a couple of issues I believe will be important as we walk over the bridge into the 21st Century.

<P><FONT SIZE="4" FACE="MS Serif" COLOR="Navy"><B>Accomplishments:
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3" FACE="MS Serif" COLOR="Navy">
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="3" FACE="MS Serif" COLOR="Navy">These last few years have been very busy ones for BXA.  The Administration realized early on that rapid technological change and economic globalization compelled comprehensive reform of our export control system, reform which balances the need to keep sensitive goods and technologies out of the hands of countries of concern without imposing unnecessary or ineffective constraints on U.S. business.  That is precisely why we reformed outdated controls, streamlined our existing export control system and worked to enhance multilateral regimes. <P> 

In the last three years, we have:<P>

</FONT>
<FONT SIZE="3" FACE="MS Serif" COLOR="Navy"><IMG BORDER="0" SRC="Blueball.gif">	substantially liberalized controls on high performance computers, semiconductors and semiconductor manufacturing equipment, Beta-test software, telecommunications equipment, and chemical mixtures, among others;

</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="3" FACE="MS Serif" COLOR="Navy"><FONT SIZE="3" FACE="MS Serif" COLOR="Navy"><IMG BORDER="0" SRC="Blueball.gif">	</FONT>	clarified and simplified the Export Administration Regulations through a comprehensive revision and reorganization, making them more user-friendly, in accordance with the goal set by the Trade Promotion Coordinating Committee (TPCC) in 1993;

</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="3" FACE="MS Serif" COLOR="Navy"><FONT SIZE="3" FACE="MS Serif" COLOR="Navy"><IMG BORDER="0" SRC="Blueball.gif">	</FONT>	improved the export license process through a Presidential Executive Order broadening agency review opportunities while limiting the time for those reviews, providing an orderly procedure to resolve interagency disputes, and establishing real accountability throughout the interagency review process.

</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="3" FACE="MS Serif" COLOR="Navy"><FONT SIZE="3" FACE="MS Serif" COLOR="Navy"><FONT SIZE="3" FACE="MS Serif" COLOR="Navy"><IMG BORDER="0" SRC="Blueball.gif"></FONT></FONT>	completed the transfer of jurisdiction of commercial communication satellites and commercial jet engine hot section technology from the State Department's Munitions List to the Commerce Control List;

</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="3" FACE="MS Serif" COLOR="Navy"><FONT SIZE="3" FACE="MS Serif" COLOR="Navy"><FONT SIZE="3" FACE="MS Serif" COLOR="Navy"><IMG BORDER="0" SRC="Blueball.gif"></FONT></FONT>	amended our national control list of nuclear items to conform more closely with that of our allies, and expanded the number of countries to which exporters can ship nuclear-controlled items via license exception.  This will simplify the license process for U.S. industry;

</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="3" FACE="MS Serif" COLOR="Navy"><FONT SIZE="3" FACE="MS Serif" COLOR="Navy"><FONT SIZE="3" FACE="MS Serif" COLOR="Navy"><IMG BORDER="0" SRC="Blueball.gif"></FONT></FONT>	liberalized our chemical export regulations, consistent with multilateral agreements, so that U.S. exporters in this high volume industry can now ship chemical mixtures containing controlled chemicals under a license exception to most destinations.  We further streamlined controls and reporting requirements on sample chemical shipments;

</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="3" FACE="MS Serif" COLOR="Navy"><FONT SIZE="3" FACE="MS Serif" COLOR="Navy"><FONT SIZE="3" FACE="MS Serif" COLOR="Navy"><IMG BORDER="0" SRC="Blueball.gif"></FONT></FONT>	developed the Special Comprehensive License, which allows experienced, high volume exporters to export a broad range of items under this procedure;

</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="3" FACE="MS Serif" COLOR="Navy"><FONT SIZE="3" FACE="MS Serif" COLOR="Navy"><FONT SIZE="3" FACE="MS Serif" COLOR="Navy"><IMG BORDER="0" SRC="Blueball.gif"></FONT></FONT>	helped establish last July the Wassenaar Arrangement of Export Controls for Conventional Arms and Dual-Use Goods and Technologies, which established multilateral controls on exports of conventional arms and sensitive dual use equipment;

</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="3" FACE="MS Serif" COLOR="Navy"><FONT SIZE="3" FACE="MS Serif" COLOR="Navy"><FONT SIZE="3" FACE="MS Serif" COLOR="Navy"><IMG BORDER="0" SRC="Blueball.gif"></FONT></FONT>	worked to strengthen other multilateral nonproliferation regimes which, in turn, will enhance U.S. exporters' ability to engage in legitimate trade and compete worldwide on a level playing field.  

</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="3" FACE="MS Serif" COLOR="Navy">Defense Diversification: As you know, BXA also does more than administer U.S. export controls.  During these last few years, through our Needs Assessment and Defense Diversification programs, we have made significant strides in reinforcing the U.S. defense industrial base which has had to deal with shrinking defense budgets.  In addition, we continue to work with the Newly Independent States to help them develop effective export control programs and to assist their defense industries in diversifying into civilian lines of production.  We are working with these countries to create new civilian jobs in their own country, while at the same time, matching U.S. firms with potential business opportunities there.

</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="3" FACE="MS Serif" COLOR="Navy">Export Enforcement: I would also be remiss if I didn't mention the important role that our enforcement programs play in protecting our national security and foreign policy interests, particularly as we focus more on specific end-users and end-uses.  Through our nonproliferation, counter terrorism, and national security export enforcement programs, we have conducted hundreds of investigations over the last four years.  These have led to the criminal prosecution of persons who illegally exported zirconium for Iraqi munitions, unlicensed equipment for India's missile program, brokerage services for  Iraqi rocket fuel, and gas masks to suspected Aum Shinrikyo terrorists in Japan, just to name a few.  These investigations also included the first civil charges and penalties for alleged unlicensed exports of biotoxins which are controlled to prevent proliferation.  Other cases involved illegal exports of police shields to Romania and polygraph equipment to South Africa during the periods when those countries' human rights policies did not meet international norms. <P> 

While the issue of enforcement is not always a pleasant topic for many exporters, I cannot stress to you enough the importance of companies to ; &quotknow their customers;&quot  and as always to exercise due diligence in transactions to destinations of proliferation concern, which we continue our efforts to identify.<P>

And in reality, these I have just mentioned are just <I>some</I> of the goals I am proud to say we have achieved.  There is much more work to do and some issues for us just never seem to go away. <P> 
<A NAME="index3"></A>
</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="4" FACE="MS Serif" COLOR="Navy"><B>Next Steps Further Liberalizations:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3" FACE="MS Serif" COLOR="Navy">



</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="3" FACE="MS Serif" COLOR="Navy">In looking at this question we are trying to focus on areas where we can get the biggest bang for the buck, as it were, consistent with our national security priorities (poor choice of cliche!).  That is, are there products, like computers several years ago, where we are controlling in excess of what is necessary for national security and where liberalization would make a significant difference to exporters?<P> 

The two areas that come to mind in that regard are oscilloscopes and machine tools, and we continue to try to come to closure internally on what to do in both areas.  The former is moving more rapidly than the latter.<P>

In addition, we are further analyzing our current licensing profile to identify other sectors that might be in a similar situation.  To be candid, I don't expect a great deal more.  We are down now to less than 9,000 licenses annually, and, increasingly, they are limited to items that are multilaterally controlled or items that are controlled to terrorist or other rogue states where our policy is unlikely to change in the short run.  <P>

At the same time, there is the ongoing need to keep our controls up to date with advances in technology and spreading foreign availability.  One reason our computer liberalization was so significant was because our predecessors delayed action, leaving a large number of items on the list that did not need to be there.  In sectors like electronics, where product life cycles are short, we need to review our policies regularly to make sure we are not continuing to control old generation items that are now widely available from other sources.<P>

Not unrelated to this problem is the question of Wassenaar implementation.  We are now in the process of preparing our control list to conform to that agreed upon by our Wassenaar colleagues.  
<A NAME="index4"></A>
</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="4" FACE="MS Serif" COLOR="Navy"><B>Encryption: </B>

</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="3" FACE="MS Serif" COLOR="Navy">One of the more important and difficult issues BXA has been involved with extensively is encryption.  The Vice President announced on October 1 the Administration's policy, which is intended to balance a number of important equities -- business' need for strong encryption to secure commercial transactions, the individual's need for privacy, and the law enforcement and national security needs of the government.<P>

As we move forward in developing the regulations, it has become clear that this is an extraordinarily complex subject with many fast-evolving technologies, each posing its own special problems and questions.  We are committed to implementing our policy on January 1, and I would urge our business colleagues to be patient.  There has so far been something of a tendency in the business community to assume that when we do not answer a question, the answer must be no.  In fact, we have not answered because there is no answer -- yet.  Grappling with the many issues involved takes time.  I am confident that ultimately we will produce a work product that is grounded in a market-driven approach to the problem and which balances the equities I've mentioned.
<A NAME="index5"></A>
</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="4" FACE="MS Serif" COLOR="Navy"><B>Process Reform:</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="3" FACE="MS Serif" COLOR="Navy">As I indicated, we have also made a lot of progress reforming our process.  Yet more work remains.  We need to make sure the Executive Order is functioning properly, and in that regard I  hope exporters will come forward and report on any problems they are encountering.<P>  

We are also working with our sister agencies to have them delegate back to us those items they have no interest in reviewing.  The Defense Department has done that to a modest degree, but as they become more familiar with the various kinds of applications we face, I expect additional delegations.  We have been working particularly hard on delegating back to us applications for temporary exports -- for trade shows and the like -- but I regret I cannot yet report success.<P>

We also plan a thorough review of the conditions we impose on licenses.  We will look at whether they are realistic and clear, and we will examine how we monitor and enforce them.  Obviously, conditions are not meaningful if there is no follow up to make sure they are being adhered to.
<A NAME="index6"></A>
</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="4" FACE="MS Serif" COLOR="Navy"><B>EPCI</B>

</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="3" FACE="MS Serif" COLOR="Navy">We continue to grapple with revising the enhanced proliferation control initiative (EPCI).  We understand that exporters view EPCI as insufficiently focused, unclear, and too broad in scope to enable them to comply, with or for the government to enforce, its provisions. And we are working on it. <P>

The Trade Promotion Coordinating Committee Deport to Congress of September 30, 1993, stated that the regulations implementing EPCI should be clarified by &quot;narrowing its scope to specific categories of commodities.&quot;  While there is interagency agreement on the need to re-focus EPCI, there is some disagreement on the method to be employed.  Some agencies favor applying EPCI to a &quot;positive&quot; list of items created from the current U.S. dual use export control list, while some favor a &quot;negative&quot; list of items that exporters would be permitted to export without EPCI restrictions.  There is also some discussion on how to revise the lengthy &quot;informed&quot; process.  When a company has been &quot;informed&quot; that a particular transaction presents a risk of diversion, no one else is so informed, and thus, this may leave others free to make the sale. <P>

We are currently awaiting consideration by the National Security Council (NSC) of our proposal to resolve this informal issue, and we expect to discuss the other issues into next year.<P>

<B>CWC</B><P>

We are awaiting ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention.  It is an Administration priority which will be resubmitted to the Congress early in next year.  I am confident that in a less political environment, we will be able to get it approved.  Even so, it will be a significant burden on BXA, which is responsible for receiving industry data declarations and assisting business in preparing them, because we will need to do in two or three months what we had planned on doing in seven -- in all likelihood without any extra money.  So once again, I urge patience.
<A NAME="index7"></A>
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="4" FACE="MS Serif" COLOR="Navy"><B>Export Administration Act:</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="3" FACE="MS Serif" COLOR="Navy">One issue that never seems to go away is the Export Administration Act.  We think that we won a little battle when the Export Administration Act passed in the House of Representatives in the last Congress, but we lost the war when the Senate killed it.<P>  

Their action was the product of several factors -- some turf issues, resistance to Administration policies for both substantive and political reasons, and lack of business community support for legislation.  While the latter is in some respects a compliment -- our liberalizations and reforms have made the Act less important to substantial portions of the business community -- it is also a sign that they see the glass as half empty rather than half full.  They are worried that the bill does not give them everything they want.  My response has been that the bill gives them important procedural and substantive protections that they will need in the face of future Administrations that might be less helpful than this one.  Unfortunately, I have failed to convince them.  The result, I fear, will be that they risk playing defense over the next two years -- fending off legislation that will constrain them instead of supporting our legislation which will provide a firm statutory foundation for moving forward.


</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="3" FACE="MS Serif" COLOR="Navy">That's an update on specifics.  Let me close with a few comments on larger issues.<P>

As I said in the beginning, I have spent a good bit of time the past several years talking about the end of the Cold War and the changes it has brought to our licensing policies.  I think everyone has gotten that message.  Now I see attention turning to what may be the prolonged uncertainty of the future.  From BXA's perspective there are two parts to that -- how we handle rogue, or pariah states, and how we deal with gray-area states, those that are neither friend nor foe; particularly those whose markets are large but whose behavior is often troubling.<P>

An increasing portion of my time is taken up with the latter category, and the most obvious case is China.  Here, we are caught up in a very public debate.  The business community by and large sees and understands the significance of the Chinese market and wants as big a piece of it as they can get.  They also believe, as do I, that more Western business activity in China leads to more Westernization and more acceptance of Western economic rules and norms; and that the economic internationalization of China will spill over into the political sphere as well, ultimately affecting the nature of the Chinese government and the policies it pursues.  <P>

At the same time, however, there is an active and growing group of people, in the Congress, in the media, and in academia, who to various degrees believe that China is heading down a road that leads to them becoming a committed adversary, and believe we should abandon the policy I have described and take a much harder line, including denying them a wide variety of items on national security grounds.<P>

The chairman of the House National Security Committee, for example, in a recent press release, discussed the need to &quot;prevent countries such as China from receiving technologies that they will exploit to increase the strength and effectiveness of their militaries...&quot;  In the next breath, he went on to say, &quot;we must assume that any sale to China is also a sale to the China's People's Liberation Army.&quot;  Putting those two statements together, of course, suggests we should sell nothing to China because we must always assume it will end up in the hands of the PLA, which is presumed to be malevolent.  This, by the way, is not a unique view in the Congress.  <P>

With some occasional bumps in the road, the first course I described is largely the policy we have followed the past two and one-half years, but it is also fair to say the Chinese don't make it easy, which has given the other side plenty of ammunition.  The Administration has spoken out clearly about China's human rights record and its troubling record of support for weapons proliferation in some unstable parts of the world.  We have imposed sanctions against China for the latter behavior twice, and we have legislation on the books imposing Tienanmen Square sanctions.  The Chinese reaction to these steps has usually been less than conciliatory often as much related to internal maneuvering in their hierarchy as to genuine policy differences.  The result is that while our policy has been consistent, its application has led to peaks and valleys in the relationship that have also spilled over into commercial activities.  It has also led to ongoing criticism from those who would treat China as the enemy, that we are not tough enough.  In my judgment, doing that would be a self-fulfilling prophecy that would not only harm our commercial interests in the region but would also complicate the achievement of our foreign policy goals.<P>

At the same time, it is critical that we maintain consistency in our encounters with China.  Nothing would serve us worse than leaving ourselves and the Chinese confused about our goals.  Achieving some consensus between the Administration and the Congress is a key element of that consistency.<P>

<B>SANCTIONS</B><P>

The question of how to deal with pariah states is no easier, though we have been trying to answer it longer.  The United States has a long history of employing a variety of sanctions in such cases, and there is a considerable body of literature devoted to analyzing those actions.  Most of the time scholars have concluded sanctions have little effect, and they frequently hurt the imposer more than the recipient as other countries' exporters rush to fill the trade gap. <P> 

Sanctions work best when they are broadly multilateral, when the target country is small and relatively defenseless, and, I would argue, when sanction-breaking activity is most likely to lead to media criticism and international embarrassment.<P>

Sanctions probably work least well when they are unilateral and are driven by home country politics rather than as part of a well thought-through multilateral strategy. <P>

What is new is the increasingly, successfully assertive role of Congress in the country-of-the month syndrome.  These amendments have been offered for years, but until recently the moderate center used to prevail, and they were defeated.<P>

What is also new is the role of provisions with extra-territorial application,  which is a major expansion of America's efforts to assert its moral and political will.  I understand there will be a major business anti-sanction lobbying effort.  The problem is growing evidence that extra-territoriality works.  Foreign companies do alter their behavior.  Lobbyists will need not only to show the principle of extra-territoriality is bad, but that it is also counterproductive<A name="index8">.</A>

</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3" FACE="MS Serif" COLOR="Navy">
</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="3" FACE="MS Serif" COLOR="Navy">The last time I spoke with you, I touched on the efforts to dismantle the Commerce Department, and the incredible job that Ron Brown was doing to stave off those efforts.  The Department is still here, but he isn't.  What a difference a year makes.  Secretary Brown is no longer with us and I miss him dearly.  He knew so well the complexities of our export control and trade policy and how important it is to the business community that we respond to their concerns, but we were lucky to inherit a Secretary Mickey Kantor who could understand these same complexities and provides the same leadership.<P>

While Secretary Kantor has decided to leave the Department, our policy will remain the same.  You should be confident that we will continue to push for an export control agenda and policy which balances national security and foreign policy interests with our economic interests.  The entire Clinton Administration will continue to provide best quality service into this next Century and to do it in close consultation with the private sector.</FONT><FONT SIZE="4"></FONT>

</font><font size=3 color=navy>Dealing in a balanced fashion with the spread of encryption is one of the most difficult public policy issues we face today.  Our response must address three important interests:  law enforcement, national security and our commercial and privacy interests.  I would like to provide some comments on how the Administration's policy balances those interests, the results of our study of the global encryption market, and our view of S. 1726, which is pending before the Committee.  <P>

Making strong commercial encryption widely available is in the best interest of the United States.  Indeed, it is inevitable, as we learn to exploit the advantages of powerful computers and advanced telecommunications.  These technologies are rapidly leading to the creation of broad electronic networks which will form the basis for communication and commerce in the future. The ability to encrypt electronic messages and data will be essential for electronic commerce and for the full development of information technology.  Businesses and individuals need encrypted products to protect sensitive commercial information and to preserve privacy, and their demand for those products will further facilitate the spread of encryption. <P>   

This trend is also economically desirable.  Protecting the confidentiality of business information will reduce losses from industrial espionage.  Perhaps more important, we are the world's leading producer of information technology with almost half of the world's producers, and roughly half their revenues come from exports.<P>

To retain this leading position and the substantial benefits to our economic health it produces, we must ensure our producers' continued ability to capture foreign market share.  Our companies must be able to meet the growing demand for products with strong encryption.  If they do not, foreign firms will ultimately step in to fill the void.  The United States' policy on encryption must advance the interests of this vital industrial sector.  We must shape our export control policies to allow American companies to take advantage of their strengths in information technology in their pursuit of global markets.<P>

Our problem arises from the fact that the increased use of encryption carries with it serious risks.  The spread of powerful encryption products poses very real problems for law enforcement and for our national security -- as my colleagues have testified.  Any policy on encryption must address these risks if it is to be in the national interest.  The Clinton Administration is making a very serious effort to develop a policy that balances the expanded availability of the strong encryption needed for economic growth and individual privacy with our national security and law enforcement needs.  Most important, we are attempting to do that in close consultation with our allies and the private sector and by working with the market, not against it. <P>    
<a name="index1"></A>        
<B>The Administration's Approach</B><P>

We have been working with industry to develop a framework, based on a key management
infrastructure which would allow government to recover the key where necessary.  This will encourage the use of strong encryption while protecting law enforcement and national security interests.  This framework will be developed and implemented by industry, not the government, and would be available for both domestic and international use.  Participation in it will be voluntary, and Americans will continue to be free to use any encryption they choose in the United States.  This approach clearly differs from previous efforts, such as "Clipper Chip," which contemplated a dominant role for government.  Our approach takes the opposite tack --  a limited government role working with industry to develop supply and demand for products that
will operate in a key management environment.  The federal government will work with industry to set standards for federal use of these products, establish criminal and civil liability for improper certification or release of keys, provide a market through purchases for government agencies, encourage the development of  pilot projects, and negotiate with our trading partners on a common approach to encryption.  We will not dictate the scope or style of the infrastructure, nor the encryption used within it. <P>     

This infrastructure will be based upon trusted parties who will hold keys to confidential data.  In some cases, corporations would hold their own keys if they are willing to meet law enforcement requirements; in other cases, users might choose to use key recovery services provided by trusted third parties.  These trusted third parties will be private entities.  Access to the keys would be provided only to the owners where they have lost or damaged their own key or to law enforcement officials acting under the authority of the courts.  This approach balances economic needs with law enforcement concerns and is one that many of our major trading partners, most
notably the United Kingdom, are also adopting.  The United States is working bilaterally and in the OECD to develop an international framework for a key management infrastructure that will ensure equal protection for consumers and equal access to markets for producers.  Our view is that a global key management infrastructure provides the best means of using strong encryption in a responsible manner.  <P>

We have come to this view after a great deal of work, one element of which I would like to mention -- a study done jointly by the Bureau of Export Administration and the National Security Agency.  <P>
<a name="index2"></A>  
<B>Background and Purpose of the Encryption Study</B><P>

Computer software and hardware companies believe that current encryption export controls are outdated and ineffective and are causing them to lose their global competitiveness.  They assert there are a multitude of strong foreign encryption products available.  In late 1994, in fulfillment of Vice President Gore's earlier commitment, National Security Advisor Anthony Lake directed that a report be prepared assessing the current and future international market for software products containing encryption and the impact of export controls on the U.S. software industry.   <P> 

The Department of Commerce and the National Security Agency jointly prepared the report, which was completed in July, 1995.  The Bureau of Export Administration took the lead in assessing domestic and international markets for encryption and the impact of export controls on U.S. industry, while NSA was responsible for identifying and evaluating foreign encryption software products and international laws and controls governing use, export and import of encryption.  A declassified version of the final report was made available to the public in January 1996.<P>
<a name="index3"></A>  
<B>Methodology and Industry Involvement</B><P>

A wide variety of government agencies, academic experts, commercial information sources, trade associations, and industry representatives were contacted.  No definitive statistics exist regarding the size and composition of the U.S. market for encryption software.  BXA consulted with computer security specialists, market researchers, and academics to create a picture of the current and future domestic market for these products.  We supplemented this information with an informal poll of information security specialists from ten diverse Fortune 500 companies to determine how these firms are currently using encryption software.<P>

To assess the international market, BXA utilized the Foreign Commercial Service in 31 U.S. embassies.  They provided input on demand for encryption in their host countries as well as the estimated U.S. share of the market.  U.S. officials overseas and foreign government officials provided information on foreign laws, regulations, and policies affecting encryption.  We used this information to determine the extent to which regulatory controls influence the international marketability of encryption software products. <P>

Foreign encryption software products were identified and purchased for review.  NSA
cryptanalysts studied the 28 foreign products ultimately obtained to evaluate their strengths and weaknesses.  Finally, in order to determine the impact of existing export controls on U.S. software vendors, BXA worked closely with the Software Publishers Association, Business Software Alliance and other industry groups to develop an industry questionnaire.  The voluntary questionnaire was mailed to about 200 firms believed to be involved in the encryption software market.  It was also posted on the Internet.  Thirty six encryption software producers elected to respond to the questionnaire, which gave them an opportunity to explain and quantify the impact
of export controls on sales, employment, profitability, and product development.  Frankly, this was a disappointing response, despite repeated appeals to the industry, and it has led us to the conclusion that many companies are unwilling or unable to quantify the effects of controls on their operations.  <P>
<a name="index4"></A>  
<B>Major Findings</B><P>

Let me summarize some of our major findings:

<UL><LI> All countries that are major producers of commercial encryption products control exports to some extent, but licensing practices and policies vary significantly.  A few countries,  notably France, Russia, and Israel, also control imports and/or domestic use of  encryption.  Some countries in Europe and elsewhere apparently treat exports to the United States of DES-based software more liberally than the United States treats DES exports to those countries, as evidenced by our ability to procure products purportedly using DES.  The U.S. generally allows export of DES-based products only for financial  institutions.  <P>

<LI> While encryption software currently accounts for only a small percentage of the total software market (1-3%), we expect the future growth trend to be great.  The overwhelming majority of general purpose software products (such as word processors,  database programs, etc.) with encryption capabilities available in U.S. and foreign markets are of U.S. origin.  The U.S. presently has few viable foreign competitors in this market.  The vast majority of these products can be exported without prior U.S. government authorization because they incorporate weaker encryption algorithms (40 bits or less).  <P>

In the security-specific software market, however, U.S. manufacturers face competition in foreign markets from countries such as the United Kingdom, Germany, and Israel.  To a large extent, markets for these products tend to be "national," with local vendors capturing a large portion of their home markets, in part due to the influence of export controls.  In many foreign countries surveyed, exportable U.S. encryption products are perceived to be of insufficient strength.  In about half the countries, overseas sources  believe that U.S. export controls have limited U.S. market share.  Some maintain that  U.S. export controls promote indigenous production of encryption software.<P>

<LI> In the absence of significant foreign competition, the effect of export controls on general  purpose software producers has been minimal so far.  For these products, customers tend  to base purchasing decisions on the primary function of the software (spreadsheet, word processing), not on encryption features.  The vast majority of general purpose products are specifically designed with encryption algorithms to be eligible for export.  Export controls have, however, affected the plans of general purpose software manufacturers to enhance encryption capabilities to meet anticipated demand.  They fear that their foreign competitors may attempt to use encryption features to differentiate their products and capture market share.<P>

<LI> Many domestic security-specific software producers are restricted to the U.S. market because of export controls.  Since security is the primary function of their products, it is  not feasible for them to utilize weaker encryption algorithms that could be exported. These companies believe that there is potential for significant foreign sales, but they are unable to quantify it since they do not market overseas.  Moreover, there is a widespread perception among foreign purchasers that strong U.S. products may not be exported, and  that exportable U.S. products are unsatisfactory.  This perception serves to dampen demand for U.S. products. <P> 

<LI> The existence of foreign products advertising DES or other strong encryption has damaged U.S. competitiveness domestically and abroad, regardless of the accuracy of  those claims.  Some U.S. companies either use or consider using foreign encryption products to communicate worldwide with their customers, suppliers and international  partners.</UL> <P>
<a name="index5"></A>  
<B>Next Steps</B><P>

Our study encouraged us to move ahead with the new approach I mentioned.  This policy is based on key recovery, but it will be a flexible approach developed by and based in the private sector. Cooperation with industry is critical, and we are finding a willingness among many firms to work together toward a solution.  As it will take some time to complete development of this new approach, we are considering a number of interim measures to ease the burden on industry while it moves to a key management infrastructure.  In the expectation of industry cooperation in that regard, the Vice President on July 12 indicated what these measures might include:

<UL><LI> Liberalizations of existing export controls for certain commercial encryption products.<P>

<LI> Pilot management programs to test key recovery with industry and with our trading partners.  <P>

<LI> The creation of a private sector advisory committee to develop performance and technical standards for products the government will purchase.<P>

<LI> And, possibly, the transfer of jurisdiction for commercial encryption products from the  Department of State to the Department of  Commerce.</UL><P>

Our work is not yet done.  We are continuing to consult with industry and international partners to refine our proposal, and we plan to send recommendations to the President this September. Our goal is to develop a flexible, market-driven approach that balances public safety, national security, and economic vitality. <P> 

In the midst of this effort, legislation such as S. 1726 would not be helpful.  Its fundamental flaw is that it does not provide the balanced approach we are seeking and instead would unnecessarily sacrifice our law enforcement and national security needs.  Legislating decontrol of encryption would destroy any hope of developing a consensus on policy; it would be greeted with dismay by our international partners; and it would pose real risks to the safety of Americans. <P>

In addition, from the perspective of the Commerce Department, we have a host of specific concerns about the bill.  In particular, we believe it misunderstands and misstates the role of NIST in regulation and standard-setting.  NIST is not a regulatory agency and does not "regulate" or control private sector use of encryption.  It prepares and recommends to the Secretary for approval Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS), which are intended to assist government agencies and are developed in consultation with the private sector.  Often these standards, of which DES is one, have been adopted and utilized by the private sector in the interest of standardization -- an important objective in this sector but one which will be determined by the market rather than the government.  The private sector has consistently been supportive of NIST's efforts in this area, and it is difficult for us to understand why the authors of S. 1726 would want to preclude that cooperation. <P>

As I said when I began my remarks, encryption is one of the most difficult issues in public policy today, but it is a problem which this Administration is committed to solving in cooperation with industry in a way that reinforces market principles and achieves our varied goals.  We hope that Congress will work with us to facilitate that process rather than obstruct it by passing unnecessary and harmful legislation. <P>

</font><font size=3 color=navy>
Thank you for the opportunity to testify on H.R. 361, the Omnibus Export Administration Act of 1996.  Reauthorization of an Export Administration Act (EAA) that takes into account the end of the Cold War is long overdue.  In addition to helping exporters by bringing the law up to date with current global realities, it is also essential that we enact a new law in order to minimize the possibility of legal challenges under the current emergency authority and to enhance our credibility in international fora.<P>

The Administration supports H.R. 361.  We believe it provides the proper balance for controlling dual-use items while minimizing the burden on U.S. exporters.  We do have concerns about several of its provisions, which my testimony details.  <P>

Before I get to those issues, however, let me explain why enactment of a new EAA is essential.  <P><A Name="index1"></A>

<B>The Need for a  Revised Export Administration Act</B><P>

Simply put, continuing to operate under emergency authority raises the possibility of increasing legal and political complications.  Operating under authority of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), as we have done on a number of occasions, most recently for the past two years, means that we must function under certain legal constraints, and it leaves important aspects of our dual-use export control system increasingly at risk of legal challenge. Operating under emergency authority also can undercut our credibility as leader of the world's efforts to stem the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.   <P>

While I do not want to overstate the case, because these complications are currently surmountable, and we will continue to pursue our export control policies despite them, at a minimum they are likely to consume increasing amounts of resources that could certainly be better used to administer and enforce the export control system effectively.<P><A Name="index2"></A>

<B>Legal Limits</B><P>

In some significant areas, we have less authority under IEEPA than under the EAA.  Foremost among them are the penalty authorities.  The penalties for violations of the Export Administration Regulations that occur under IEEPA, both criminal and administrative, are significantly lower than those available for violations that occur under the EAA.  Even the EAA penalties are too low, having been eroded over the past 17 years by inflation.  One of H.R. 361's most useful enforcement features is its increase in criminal and administrative penalties.  <P>

We rely on the deterrent effect of stiff penalties for export control violations. The longer we are under IEEPA, or even the EAA of 1979, the more the deterrent effect will erode, and companies will begin to think of the lower penalties merely as a cost of doing business, especially for nonproliferation and foreign policy cases. <P>

Another limitation of IEEPA concerns export enforcement agents' police powers (e.g., the authority to make arrests, execute search warrants, and carry firearms).  Those powers lapsed with the EAA.  Our agents must now obtain Special Deputy U.S. Marshal status, which expires and must be renewed annually, in order to exercise these authorities and function as law enforcement officers.  While this complication can be overcome, doing so consumes limited resources that would be better used on enforcement.<P>
Finally, the longer the EAA lapse continues, the more likely we will be faced with attempts to impose additional limits on our authority.  For example, IEEPA does not have an explicit confidentiality provision like that in section 12(c) of the EAA or the similar provision in H.R. 361.  As a result, the Department's ability to protect from public disclosure information obtained concerning export license applications, the export licenses themselves, and related export enforcement information is likely to come under increasing attack on several fronts.  Similarly, the absence of specific antiboycott references in IEEPA has led some respondents in antiboycott cases to argue -- thus far unsuccessfully -- that BXA has no authority to implement and enforce the antiboycott provisions of the EAA and Export Administration Regulations. <P><A Name="index3"></A>

<B>Policy Ramifications</B><P>

The lapse of authority also has domestic and international policy ramifications.  Although we have made great progress in eliminating unnecessary controls while enhancing our ability to control truly sensitive exports, industry has the right to expect these reforms to be certain and permanent.  For example, while the Administration has begun to implement the President's executive order on license processing, which increases the discipline on and timeliness of the license review process, a statutory foundation for that process would send an important message to U.S. exporters that these reforms will not be rolled back.  That will give our exporters the certainty they need to plan their export transactions.<P>

In addition, failure to enact a new EAA that reflects the changed world situation sends the wrong message to our allies and regime partners, many of whom we have been urging to strengthen their export control laws and systems.  We have also been urging, as part of our export control cooperation with the former Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact countries, that those countries adopt control laws passed by their respective parliaments.  Our credibility could be diminished by our own lack of a statute.<P><A Name="index4"></A>

<B>Renewal of  the EAA of 1979</B><P>

Some of these same issues militate against a simple renewal of the EAA of 1979.  For example, as I noted earlier, the penalties of the EAA of 1979 have been substantially eroded by inflation.  In addition, the EAA of 1979 is a Cold War statute that simply does not reflect current geo-political realities.  Its basic national security control authorities are predicated on the existence of
a multilateral regime, CoCom, that ended more than two years ago.  A renewal of the EAA of 1979 is not much better than operating under IEEPA.<P><A Name="index5"></A>

<B>H.R. 361 - The Omnibus Export Administration Act of 1996</B><P>

H.R. 361 makes several needed and significant improvements to the EAA which are similar to those proposed in the Administration's 1994 bill.  They include control authority updated to address current security threats, increased discipline on unilateral controls, and enhanced enforcement authorities.  H.R. 361 also contains provisions consistent with recent Administration licensing process and commodity jurisdiction reforms.<P>

H.R. 361's structure reflects the new challenges resulting from the end of the Cold War.  The basic control authorities are multilateral and unilateral (emergency) controls instead of the national security and foreign policy authorities of the EAA of 1979, just as the Administration's bill proposed.  H.R. 361's new structure explicitly recognizes the preference for compliance with international regimes that the U.S. either is a member of (such as the Wassenaar Arrangement, the Missile Technology Control Regime, the Australia Group, and the Nuclear Suppliers' Group) or may help create or join in the future.  H.R. 361's clear preference and explicit guidelines for multilateral controls is essential for achieving our nonproliferation goals without disadvantaging U.S. exporters.<P>

Another significant positive feature of H.R. 361 is its increased discipline on unilateral controls.  The determinations required by H.R. 361 for the imposition, extension, or expansion of unilateral controls are similar to those proposed by the Administration.  These determinations will require a more precise analysis of the anticipated and actual effectiveness of unilateral controls.  This more precise analysis will ensure that the economic security of the U.S. is not adversely affected by controls which do not significantly advance national security, foreign policy, or nonproliferation
objectives.<P>

H.R. 361 also supports the recent Administration reforms of the licensing and commodity jurisdiction processes.  Its standards for license processing, which are consistent with the new executive order, include shortening the time allowed for review of applications and adding discipline to the interagency process, while permitting all pertinent agencies to review any license
applications.   These reforms improve the system's responsiveness to exporters while also enhancing our ability to meet our national security, foreign policy, and nonproliferation goals.  <P>

Consistent with the President's recent revision of the commodity jurisdiction process, H.R. 361 requires timely settlement of interagency disputes on whether an item is dual-use or munitions.  It also requires increased coordination and transparency among the agencies in commodity jurisdiction and classification determinations.  These reforms will make the export control system more responsive to exporters without diminishing the system's ability to meet our national security, foreign policy, and nonproliferation objectives.<P>

One other area where H.R. 361 makes significant improvements is enforcement.  First, it substantially increases criminal and civil penalties, which, as I mentioned, is long overdue.  Not only has inflation eaten away at the 1979 penalty levels, but global political changes demand the significantly higher civil penalties that H.R. 361 provides for violations of nonproliferation controls in order to add credibility to our efforts.   H.R. 361 also provides greater operational enforcement authority for undercover operations and forfeitures.   These enhancements are particularly important in the current environment, with more diffuse threats, elaborate procurement networks, and suspect end users more difficult to identify.<P><A Name="index6"></A>

<B>Provisions of Concern</B><P>

We do have concerns, however, about H.R. 361's terrorism, unfair impact, antiboycott private right of action, and judicial review provisions, which I will outline.  We also have constitutional concerns which another Administration witness will address.<P>

The Administration shares the Congress' concern about terrorism, and we have adopted a very hard line against terrorist states, including support for Senator D'Amato's Iran-Libya legislation.  However, H.R. 361's terrorism provision would significantly reduce the Administration's flexibility to regulate exports to countries on the terrorist list to reflect unique or changed circumstances.  For example, the Administration would lack the necessary flexibility to supply U.S. government (diplomatic, military, or humanitarian) operations, multilateral peacekeeping and humanitarian missions, International Atomic Energy Agency inspections, and activities of U.S. or third country nationals unaffiliated with the terrorism-list government. <P>

H.R. 361's unfair impact provision is a step backward from the Administration's proposal to clarify exporters' rights to petition for relief from burdensome and ineffective export control requirements.  The provision limits U.S. exporters' statutory right to seek relief by failing to include ineffective controls and competitive disadvantage as statutory grounds upon which U.S. exporters can petition for relief.  Second, it exempts some of the bill's provisions from the unfair impact process entirely.  Third, it fails to explicitly allow unfair impact petitions based on anticipated market conditions. <P>


H.R. 361's authorization of private actions for antiboycott violations could compromise enforcement of the antiboycott provisions of the EAA.  Allowing suits for actual and punitive damages, whether or not a violation has been found through government enforcement action, could jeopardize the record of successful enforcement of the antiboycott law through inconsistent judicial interpretations, diversion of government resources, and private settlements that deny access to evidence.<P>
     
Finally, H.R. 361's judicial review provision should be clarified to ensure it does not inadvertently allow inappropriate judicial review of U.S. foreign and national security policies.  <P>

<B>Conclusion</B><P>

Those are our concerns, Mr. Chairman, and we look forward to working with the Committee to address them.  The important point, however, is the need to act this year on the bill in order to provide the proper balance for controlling dual-use items while minimizing the burden on U.S. exporters.  <P>

<hr></p>

<p>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) has partnered
with consortia like CALSTART throughout the nation to develop leading-edge
transportation technologies, both for commercial and military needs. Headquartered
in Hawaii, California, Indiana, Georgia, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts,
these consortia operate several hundred technology, development and demonstration projects; all in the electric and hybrid electric vehicle industry.</p>

<p>CALSTART presents to you a summary of several DARPA consortia
projects presented recently to a joint meeting with the Partnership for a New Generation Vehicle(PNGV), a U.S. partnership with the Big 3 automakers. Weve also included
information on the PNGV program, which gives their perspective
on needed technologies for more efficient future passenger vehicles.</p>

 - Rules Crimping California Propane Conversions
</H3></A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 California  While propane-powered vehicles still hold the lead in counts of Californias alternative-fueled vehicles, some in the field say the states tough emissions rules are killing the propane conversion industry, reports Oxy-Fuel News. There are currently 45,000 propane-fueled vehicles in California, but the numbers are misleading, advocates say; almost all were in operation before the California Air Resources Board (CARB) tightened its rules in 1992. Conversion kit-makers are now required to pay CARB more than $200,000 per "engine family type" and submit vehicles to 100,000-mile durability tests, which may take as long as six months to complete. Because of various engine configurations, converters can spend millions of dollars to certify one engine size, said Bruce Eikelberger of Alternate Fuel Technology, a conversion company. CARB spokesman Alan Hearst said CARBs goal is cleaner air; it should be up to the industry to find a way to make their kits meet the standards.

 - Nissan 1st Automaker to Offer Lithium-Battery EV
</H3></A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 Japan  Nissan has begun selling lithium-ion battery-powered electric vehicles (EVs)  but only in Japan, reports Kyodo News International. The automaker is the first in the world to offer an EV with the advanced batteries, which, on a pound-for-pound basis, have triple the energy storage of lead-acid batteries and reportedly last longer. Nissan intends to lease 30 Prairie Joy EVs annually, initially to local governments and corporations. Payments will be $259 (320,000 yen) per month for the three-year leases. The car, sometimes referred to as a "station wagon" and sometimes a "sport-utility vehicle," has a 124-mile range between charges. Sony Corp. helped develop the batteries. Honda is also offering EVs with advanced batteries, but its car uses nickel-metal hydride (NiMH) batteries; lithium-ion batteries store 1.5 times the energy levels of NiMH batteries (News Notes 1/10, 6/18, 6/20, 8/6, 10/15, 11/14 and 12/13/96).

 - EPA  Rail Locomotives Must Clean Up Their Act
</H3></A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 Washington, D.C.  For the first time, railroad locomotives will be subject to air pollution rules from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, standards that will require emissions cuts of up to two-thirds, reports the Los Angeles Times. A typical locomotive puts out as many tons of nitrogen oxides (NOx)  a chief ingredient of smog  as 2,000 passenger cars; 18,000 locomotives in the U.S. are responsible for 5 percent of the countrys air pollution. Beginning in 2001, railroads must gradually begin reducing emissions. By 2005, emissions must be cut 50 percent for hydrocarbons and particulates; 66 percent for NOx. Engine modifications are expected to raise engine costs by about 4 percent, according to EPA estimates. Because Californias air is the worst, the railroads have agreed to put the new engines  not yet engineered  in service there first.

 - GMs Bi-Fuel NGV Pickup Launch Approaches
</H3></A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 Detroit  General Motors has officially announced details  such as price, availability and warranties  for the natural gas vehicle (NGV) pickups it will begin offering in spring 1997. The natural gas option on 1997 Chevrolet C2500 and GMC Sierra full-size pickups will be $5,800, but fuel-cost savings, income tax credits and gas-utility incentives will bring the cost down. Fully certified "factory package" bi-fuel pickups  that will run on either gasoline or compressed natural gas (CNG)  will carry 3-year/36,000 mile "Bumper to Bumper Plus" warranties. The carbon-fiber-wrapped steel CNG tanks carry the equivalent of 13 gallons; a standard 34-gallon gasoline tank is also fitted. Production and installation of the natural gas systems will be done under the auspices of IMPCO Technologies (News Notes 1/15, 3/7, 4/11, 5/16, 6/14, 6/19, 7/3, 9/30 and 12/28/96).

 - Olympic Souvenir? How About an Electric Tram?
</H3></A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 Atlanta, Georgia  For souvenir hunters looking for 1996 Summer Olympic Games in Atlanta memorabilia, an offering by Georgia Power just might be a winner: The electric trams that shuttled athletes and coaches around the Olympic Village are now for sale, according to an Electric Vehicle Association of the Americas (EVAA) press release. The 70 trams were used in 24-hour service, but only for 35 days until the games ended. More than 1.3 million passenger trips were logged, but the trams are still in excellent shape. Among the early buyers of the 36-passenger trams have been amusement and state parks, zoos, universities and a church. Each tow trailer, built by Tug Manufacturing, pulls three 12-passenger trailers built by Taylor-Dunn. More information may be obtained by contacting Georgia Power at (770) 216-1315.

 - Unique Mobility to Build a Stealth Bus Drivetrain
</H3></A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 Golden, Colorado  Electric vehicle (EV) drive system-builder Unique Mobility has received a $1.23 million contract to supply an advanced electric drive system for an Advanced Technology Transit Bus (ATTB), or "Stealth Bus." The 18-month contract is with the Metropolitan Transit Authority of Harris County Texas (Houston Metro), which is co-developing the bus along with Northrop Grumman Corp. and the U.S. Department of Transportation. Unique will produce a 107-kilowatt system that includes wheel motors with gear reduction, microprocessor controls and regenerative braking. The hybrid-electric bus uses advanced materials from military and aerospace applications to cut weight without sacrificing strength, hence its nickname. Last October, Northrop rolled out its first bus (News Notes 10/2/96 and 10/8/96).

 - Grand Canyon May Ban Cars, Use Alt-Fuel Buses
</H3></A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 Grand Canyon National Park  The National Park Service may ban nearly all cars from Grand Canyon National Park as part of its plan to get visitors into light-rail trains or alternative-fueled buses. Some 1.5 million tourist-filled cars enter the park each year, causing significant traffic  and smog that obscures canyon views (News Notes 5/30/96). The plan calls for electric buses or methanol-powered buses and light rail trains to cut 80 percent of the vehicle traffic. Those staying at hotels, camping in the park, or traveling on state Route 64 will still be allowed to drive; others will use a massive parking lot to be built outside the park. The proposal is part of a $350 million plan to improve the park for visitors, which numbered about 5 million last year.

 - L.A. Airport Solicits Bids for 39 Clean-Fuel Vehicles
</H3></A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 Los Angeles  Looking to expand its fleet of clean-air vehicles, Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) officials are soliciting bids for 39 new alternative-fueled vehicles. The Department of Airports is looking to buy 10 liquefied natural gas (LNG)-powered transit buses, eight bi-fuel pickup trucks, 16 bi-fuel sedans, and five police sedans powered only by compressed natural gas (CNG). The bi-fuel vehicles are to be capable of running on either gasoline or an alternative fuel. LAX already operates 21 buses on LNG; with another 6 already on order, 71 percent of its 52-bus fleet will operate on the cleaner-burning fuel. The remaining buses will later be converted to LNG. According to the request for bids, LAX estimates the vehicle costs at $300,000 per bus, $25,000 apiece for the bi-fuel vehicles and $30,000 for the CNG police cars.

 - 1,000 Mexico City Taxis to Become NGVs
</H3></A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 Mexico City  Penn Octane Corp. is expected to convert up to 1,000 of Mexico Citys taxis to compressed natural gas (CNG) as part of a wide-ranging agreement reached with private owners of public transportation companies there. Its part of a package deal between four entities that includes a $90 million, 1,500-bus purchase through Penn Octanes recently acquired bus dealership (News Notes 1/18/97), the taxi conversions, and CNG refueling stations to be owned and operated by Penn Octane. Taxi operator Sistema De Transportes En Taxis, S.A. de C.V. will also commit to long-term fuel purchases from Houston, Texas-based Penn Octane. About 70 percent of Mexico Citys air pollution  the worlds worst  comes from vehicles (News Notes 1/25/96, 3/14/96, 10/18/96 and 11/7/96). Natural gas-powered vehicles (NGVs) produce 90 percent fewer emissions than conventional vehicles.

Christine Todd Whitman  marking a new direction for her state  will be directing the New Jersey Transit agency to begin replacing its diesel buses with natural gas-powered buses, reports the Tri-State Transportation Campaigns newsletter. Whitman wants 50 "cruiser buses," or long- versus short-distance buses, and plans a fast-fueling terminal in Howell, Monmouth County, within two years as part of the $35 million project. Clean-air proponents say New Jersey had been reluctant  despite mounting evidence of diesel exhausts unhealthy effects  to do anything about the problem. Natural gas-powered vehicles (NGVs) emit about 90 percent fewer emissions than diesel-powered models, and many fleets report fuel-cost savings of up to 40 percent (News Notes 8/20/96). To further cut emissions, the state is expanding its random roadside inspection program to include fines; more than 20 percent of vehicles tested failed.

 - Singapores Clean Air Stems From Permits, Taxes
</H3></A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 Singapore  Traffic jams  and air pollution  are rare in Singapore because of government policies including "permits" to own cars, stiff gasoline taxes and a toll system charging drivers $1.40 to enter downtown areas, reports Associated Press. In the 25-mile long island country, vehicle ownership is a privilege, not a right. Limited quantities of 10-year ownership permits sell at monthly auctions at prices up to $75,000; most go to dealers selling car-and-permit packages. Authorities also tax gasoline  to nearly $4.50 per gallon  and parking spaces to discourage stores and churches from offering free parking, while closed-circuit television systems monitor traffic flows and coordinate traffic signals. The nation of three million has 350,000 cars, one for every eight people; the rest use plentiful buses, taxis and a mass-transit rail system that covers much of the country. Singapore also plans to install electronic toll-collection systems on all of its major roads by the end of the year.

 - EPA Extends Smog-Plan Comment Deadline
</H3></A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 Washington, D.C.  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has extended  for 60 days  the public comment period for its proposed new rules on ozone and particulate air pollution, reports Reuters. The comment period had been set to close Feb. 18, but will now close April 18. The action means the publication of final rules will also be pushed back from June to August. While some groups  including oil industry lobbyists  say the proposed new rules would cost more than the benefits, doctors, health advocates and administration officials cite studies showing 20,000 American lives and billions of dollars in health costs would be saved each year (News Notes 11/25/96, 12/2/96, 1/15/97 and 1/21/97). The EPAs toll-free comment line is 1-888-TELL EPA.

 - Pena Calls for Plan to Cut Oil Imports
</H3></A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 Washington, D.C.  Saying the country is sliding toward "energy insecurity," Energy Secretary nominee Federico Pena is calling for action to reduce the countrys dependence on oil imports, reports Reuters. "I believe that we will not reverse our slide toward energy insecurity without a set of strategies that address both energy production and consumption and that are coupled with specific targets and timetables to measure performance," Pena said during his confirmation hearing before the Senate Energy Committee. His predecessor at the Department of Energy, Hazel R. OLeary, said recently she believes "wake-up calls" such as price shocks will be needed to spur Americans to conserve energy and give more attention to alternative fuels (News Notes 1/20/97). More than half the oil consumed in the U.S. is imported; in May 1996, usage that month spiked to an average of 9.979 million barrels per day (News Notes 6/4/96 and 8/1/96).

 - Russian Scientists Develop Hydrogen Car Engine
</H3></A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 Moscow  Russian scientists have developed a hydrogen-powered automobile engine that produces only water vapor as exhaust, reports Xinhua. Citing the Rossiskaya Gazeta, the article says the hydrogen is stored in a tank thats similar in size to a conventional gasoline tank, then reacts with oxygen in the air through "a special electrochemical dynamo." Electricity produced in the process is then used to power electric drive motors. The article  lean on details  doesnt say if the system is operating in a vehicle or if the project is merely in the preliminary stages. Automakers worldwide are working on similar "fuel cell" projects: Daimler Benz showed its hydrogen fuel cell-powered vehicle in May 1996 (News Notes 5/14/96); Toyota showed its version in October 1996 (News Notes 10/4/96); and last month Chrysler showed its system that will convert gasoline to hydrogen on-board the vehicle (News Notes 1/6/97).

 - Half of Berkeleys School Buses to be NGVs in 97
</H3></A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 Berkeley, Calif.  The Berkeley Unified School District took delivery of two more natural gas-powered school buses this week as it proceeds with its plan to have half of its fleet running on the cleaner-burning fuel by the end of the year, reports the Alameda Times-Star. The $320,000 buses were paid for with a grant from the Bay Area Air Quality Management District. The school district  like many in the nation  is turning to natural gas because emissions are far less than from gasoline or diesel-powered vehicles, and the refueling and maintenance costs are cheaper too (News Notes 8/20/96 and 1/9/97). Tulsa, Oklahomas school district saved $100,000 last year on fuel costs alone for its natural gas-powered buses.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
 California  While propane-powered vehicles still hold the lead in counts of Californias alternative-fueled vehicles, some in the field say the states tough emissions rules are killing the propane conversion industry, reports Oxy-Fuel News. There are currently 45,000 propane-fueled vehicles in California, but the numbers are misleading, advocates say; almost all were in operation before the California Air Resources Board (CARB) tightened its rules in 1992. Conversion kit-makers are now required to pay CARB more than $200,000 per "engine family type" and submit vehicles to 100,000-mile durability tests, which may take as long as six months to complete. Because of various engine configurations, converters can spend millions of dollars to certify one engine size, said Bruce Eikelberger of Alternate Fuel Technology, a conversion company. CARB spokesman Alan Hearst said CARBs goal is cleaner air; it should be up to the industry to find a way to make their kits meet the standards.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
 Washington, D.C.  For the first time, railroad locomotives will be subject to air pollution rules from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, standards that will require emissions cuts of up to two-thirds, reports the Los Angeles Times. A typical locomotive puts out as many tons of nitrogen oxides (NOx)  a chief ingredient of smog  as 2,000 passenger cars; 18,000 locomotives in the U.S. are responsible for 5 percent of the countrys air pollution. Beginning in 2001, railroads must gradually begin reducing emissions. By 2005, emissions must be cut 50 percent for hydrocarbons and particulates; 66 percent for NOx. Engine modifications are expected to raise engine costs by about 4 percent, according to EPA estimates. Because Californias air is the worst, the railroads have agreed to put the new engines  not yet engineered  in service there first.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
 Japan  Nissan has begun selling lithium-ion battery-powered electric vehicles (EVs)  but only in Japan, reports Kyodo News International. The automaker is the first in the world to offer an EV with the advanced batteries, which, on a pound-for-pound basis, have triple the energy storage of lead-acid batteries and reportedly last longer. Nissan intends to lease 30 Prairie Joy EVs annually, initially to local governments and corporations. Payments will be $259 (320,000 yen) per month for the three-year leases. The car, sometimes referred to as a "station wagon" and sometimes a "sport-utility vehicle," has a 124-mile range between charges. Sony Corp. helped develop the batteries. Honda is also offering EVs with advanced batteries, but its car uses nickel-metal hydride (NiMH) batteries; lithium-ion batteries store 1.5 times the energy levels of NiMH batteries (News Notes 1/10, 6/18, 6/20, 8/6, 10/15, 11/14 and 12/13/96).

<BLOCKQUOTE>
 Golden, Colorado  Electric vehicle (EV) drive system-builder Unique Mobility has received a $1.23 million contract to supply an advanced electric drive system for an Advanced Technology Transit Bus (ATTB), or "Stealth Bus." The 18-month contract is with the Metropolitan Transit Authority of Harris County Texas (Houston Metro), which is co-developing the bus along with Northrop Grumman Corp. and the U.S. Department of Transportation. Unique will produce a 107-kilowatt system that includes wheel motors with gear reduction, microprocessor controls and regenerative braking. The hybrid-electric bus uses advanced materials from military and aerospace applications to cut weight without sacrificing strength, hence its nickname. Last October, Northrop rolled out its first bus (News Notes 10/2/96 and 10/8/96).

<BLOCKQUOTE>
 Atlanta, Georgia  For souvenir hunters looking for 1996 Summer Olympic Games in Atlanta memorabilia, an offering by Georgia Power just might be a winner: The electric trams that shuttled athletes and coaches around the Olympic Village are now for sale, according to an Electric Vehicle Association of the Americas (EVAA) press release. The 70 trams were used in 24-hour service, but only for 35 days until the games ended. More than 1.3 million passenger trips were logged, but the trams are still in excellent shape. Among the early buyers of the 36-passenger trams have been amusement and state parks, zoos, universities and a church. Each tow trailer, built by Tug Manufacturing, pulls three 12-passenger trailers built by <a href=http://www.calstart.org/taylordunn/>Taylor-Dunn</a>. More information may be obtained by contacting Georgia Power at (770) 216-1315.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
 Detroit  General Motors has officially announced details  such as price, availability and warranties  for the natural gas vehicle (NGV) pickups it will begin offering in spring 1997. The natural gas option on 1997 Chevrolet C2500 and GMC Sierra full-size pickups will be $5,800, but fuel-cost savings, income tax credits and gas-utility incentives will bring the cost down. Fully certified "factory package" bi-fuel pickups  that will run on either gasoline or compressed natural gas (CNG)  will carry 3-year/36,000 mile "Bumper to Bumper Plus" warranties. The carbon-fiber-wrapped steel CNG tanks carry the equivalent of 13 gallons; a standard 34-gallon gasoline tank is also fitted. Production and installation of the natural gas systems will be done under the auspices of IMPCO Technologies (News Notes 1/15, 3/7, 4/11, 5/16, 6/14, 6/19, 7/3, 9/30 and 12/28/96).

<BLOCKQUOTE>
 Los Angeles  Looking to expand its fleet of clean-air vehicles, Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) officials are soliciting bids for 39 new alternative-fueled vehicles. The Department of Airports is looking to buy 10 liquefied natural gas (LNG)-powered transit buses, eight bi-fuel pickup trucks, 16 bi-fuel sedans, and five police sedans powered only by compressed natural gas (CNG). The bi-fuel vehicles are to be capable of running on either gasoline or an alternative fuel. LAX already operates 21 buses on LNG; with another 6 already on order, 71 percent of its 52-bus fleet will operate on the cleaner-burning fuel. The remaining buses will later be converted to LNG. According to the request for bids, LAX estimates the vehicle costs at $300,000 per bus, $25,000 apiece for the bi-fuel vehicles and $30,000 for the CNG police cars.

 Grand Canyon National Park  The National Park Service may ban nearly all cars from Grand Canyon National Park as part of its plan to get visitors into light-rail trains or alternative-fueled buses. Some 1.5 million tourist-filled cars enter the park each year, causing significant traffic  and smog that obscures canyon views (News Notes 5/30/96). The plan calls for electric buses or methanol-powered buses and light rail trains to cut 80 percent of the vehicle traffic. Those staying at hotels, camping in the park, or traveling on state Route 64 will still be allowed to drive; others will use a massive parking lot to be built outside the park. The proposal is part of a $350 million plan to improve the park for visitors, which numbered about 5 million last year.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
 New Jersey  New Jersey Gov. Christine Todd Whitman  marking a new direction for her state  will be directing the New Jersey Transit agency to begin replacing its diesel buses with natural gas-powered buses, reports the Tri-State Transportation Campaigns newsletter. Whitman wants 50 "cruiser buses," or long- versus short-distance buses, and plans a fast-fueling terminal in Howell, Monmouth County, within two years as part of the $35 million project. Clean-air proponents say New Jersey had been reluctant  despite mounting evidence of diesel exhausts unhealthy effects  to do anything about the problem. Natural gas-powered vehicles (NGVs) emit about 90 percent fewer emissions than diesel-powered models, and many fleets report fuel-cost savings of up to 40 percent (News Notes 8/20/96). To further cut emissions, the state is expanding its random roadside inspection program to include fines; more than 20 percent of vehicles tested failed.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
 Mexico City  Penn Octane Corp. is expected to convert up to 1,000 of Mexico Citys taxis to compressed natural gas (CNG) as part of a wide-ranging agreement reached with private owners of public transportation companies there. Its part of a package deal between four entities that includes a $90 million, 1,500-bus purchase through Penn Octanes recently acquired bus dealership (News Notes 1/18/97), the taxi conversions, and CNG refueling stations to be owned and operated by Penn Octane. Taxi operator Sistema De Transportes En Taxis, S.A. de C.V. will also commit to long-term fuel purchases from Houston, Texas-based Penn Octane. About 70 percent of Mexico Citys air pollution  the worlds worst  comes from vehicles (News Notes 1/25/96, 3/14/96, 10/18/96 and 11/7/96). Natural gas-powered vehicles (NGVs) produce 90 percent fewer emissions than conventional vehicles.

<H3 align = center><FONT COLOR=#FF0000>Meet America's Transportation Innovators</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Helvetica"></FONT><BR></h3>
<P>

<!---Sample Header Tag--->
<h3><FONT COLOR=#808080></FONT></h3>

Are electric cars becoming a reality?  Has anyone built a "hybrid" vehicle yet?  Whos tackling the technical problems of making cleaner cars?
The answers are yes -- we are.  We are Americas advanced transportation consortia., dedicated to creating good jobs in a new global industry.<p>  
Spread across the breadth of the nation, we represent six regional hubs of technical innovation in advanced transportation (see participant map, pages 14-15).  Focused public investment has meant significant innovation.  Linked in a cooperative information-sharing web, our networks of leading-edge firms and organizations -- many formerly involved in defense efforts  are rapidly tapping Americas talent to create the world's next generation of cars, trucks and buses. <p>
 
<h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>A Bias for Action</FONT></h3><p>
Each of the six consortia are unique.  But by working together through the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA), we are taking the knowledge of a nation and focusing it on electric and hybrid electric vehicle development.  Our charter is not talk and study  we believe in acting and building.   In this year alone we will have placed more advanced vehicles on the road than anyone else in America including automakers.<p>

<h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>Dual-Use</FONT></h3><p>
A key focus of the consortia effort has been to further the development of dual-use technology  components and systems that serve not only commercial vehicle markets but also meet emerging requirements for our nations defense.  The value of this approach is underscored by the fact that much of each regions technology and job growth can be traced back to specific military or space-based initiatives.  Closing the loop with a diverse portfolio of commercial and defense transportation technologies serves not only national priorities, but will strengthen local economies for years to come. <p>

<h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>A Model for Success</FONT></h3><p>
Teamwork, motivation and true public/private cooperation are making it happen.  At the direction of Congress, ARPA in 1993 created an electric and hybrid electric vehicle development program.  ARPA took a modest $25 million federal investment and more than doubled it by partnering with industry.  But you cant buy innovation.  It has to be encouraged.  ARPA realized not all the answers are at the top.  It sought the best talent and approaches from diverse teams of more than 130 private companies working together.  And then set them to work.  <p>

<h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>Tomorrow is Here Today</FONT></h3><p>
We are making the so-called impossible happen today.  <p><ul>
<li> Have you heard of flywheel mechanical batteries?  Theyre real.  Were testing them now.  
<li> Can a car be built entirely of lightweight composite materials?  Ask us.  Were doing it.  
<li> Can an electric car be manufactured affordably?  Look at our design.  Its on the road today.  
<li> Does fast recharging work?  Look up the 24-hour distance record for EVs.  We set it.  
<li> We go from paper to prototype in months, not years.    <p></ul>          
Like a fresh wind blowing across America, there is new spirit of innovation moving across the land.  It is based on cooperation tempered with competition, a can-do approach that encourages the best teams to tackle tough problems on tight deadlines.  And deliver.  It can happen.  Let us show you how.<p>
So please read on and meet Americas innovators.  Because in transportation, America cant afford to stall.<p>








<h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>New ARPA Consortium Formed for Mid-Atlantic States</FONT></h3>

America's newest advanced transportation consortium, the Mid Atlantic Regional Consortium for Advanced Vehicles (MARCAV), has just received ARPA funding to demonstrate and deploy several innovative transportation technology projects. This new consortium focuses the talents of New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, West Virginia, Virginia and Pennsylvania, where it is based.
Some of the first technologies under development include a high efficiency DC motor and controller, composite utility EV and polymer batteries.<p><ul>

<b>Electric Vehicles just make sense on 
		the islands of Hawaii.</b> Take Oahu, for instance. It is no more than 45 miles across, hardly any need for the distance demands accommodated by conventionally fueled vehicles. Most of the driving is done on flat, sea-level roads, ideal conditions for getting the most range out of electric vehicles. Because many of the islands' cities and residents share extremely close quarters, the demand for clean and efficient transportation within this lush environment is not just a goal to shoot for, but a mission.<p>
<h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>
The HEVDP Mission</FONT></h3><p>
Enter the Hawaii Electric Vehicle Demonstration Project (HEVDP).  It was started in 1993 with a $5 million earmark from the Advanced Research Projects Agency.  The coalition itself raised $5.7 million in matching funds for a total $10.7 million in its first year of operation.<p>

<a href="/image/arpaw94a.gif"><img border = 0 align=right src="/image/arpaw94a1.gif"></a><blockquote><b><i>ELECTRIC RIDE -- The Honolulu Public Transit Authority will place two electric transit buses into service in Hawaii.</i></b></blockquote><br clear = all><br><p>

HEVDP is managed by the High Technology Development Program, which operates as an attached agency of the State of Hawaii's Department of Business, Economic Development & Tourism. HEVDP's mission is to:<p><ul>
<li> Maximize the number of new electric vehicles on the road;
<li> Broaden the range of EV types and sizes to fit an increasing array of applications;
<li> Develop EV infrastructure such as EV centers and special chargers;
<li> Provide data acquisition and analysis such as sensors, data acquisition systems and software;
<li> Enhance technical opportunities in the areas of EV conversion and training; and
<li> Support military and commercial EVs by providing warranties and service centers.<p></ul>



<h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>Accomplishments</FONT></h3><p>
HEVDP's key accomplishments to date include:<p><ul>
<li> Designing  and preparing to deploy 37 electric vehicles in Hawaii;
<li> Successfully crash testing S-10 pickups converted by U.S. Electricar to all-electric drive based upon design changes recommended by ARPA coalition crash simulation software.  This software is available on-line via Internet to all consortium members connected to the ARPA Electric Vehicle National Data Center in Hawaii;
<li> Developing electronic data interchange software for EVs;
<li> Developing noise protected sensors and digitizers used for vehicle testing and analysis;
<li> Developing 40-foot transit bus at the Honolulu Public Transit used on regular bus routes.  Expected for roll-out soon.  Electric tank motor reconfigured as electric bus motor;
<li> Setting up an electric vehicle manufacturing facility in Hawaii for U.S. Electricar.  The facility will convert Chevrolet S-10 pickup trucks and Geo Prizms to electric power;
<li> Funding the fast pulse battery charger by consortium member Electronic Power Technology, Inc., also supported by the Southern Coalition for Advanced Transportation. This effort achieved a 24-hour distance world record of 831 miles for an all-electric vehicle without changing batteries;<p></ul>


<img align=right src="/image/arpaw94b.gif"> 
<blockquote><b><i>Our goal is to achieve superior electric vehicle performance and make results available to all coalitions from the National Electric Vehicle Data Center in Hawaii." -- Dr. David Y.Y. Yun Principal Investigator,  HEVDP</i></b></blockquote><br clear = all><br><p><ul>

<li> Developing ARPA-funded 30-foot and 40-foot propane hybrid buses with team members El Dorado National and Kaman Electromagnetics that recover 30% of electric drive energy through regenerative braking due to stop and go routes;
<li> Conducting an EV course with the Kaui Community College to study electric vehicles; 
<li> Opening a composite EV manufacturing facility in Hawaii by Suntera; and
<li> Designing lightweight "from the ground up" Suntera composite electric pickup trucks which have a new "skin and bones" structure design to provide crash protection equivalent to metal vehicles.<p></ul>
<h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>Future Directions</FONT></h3><p>
HEVDP's future involvement in the advanced transportation industry include:<p><ul>
<li> Developing advanced new types of vehicles and doing extensive battery testing and certification;
<li> Developing much more powerful motors; and
<li> Expanding into electric boats and trolleys;   <p></ul>
HEVDP's future plans also involve becoming a manufacturing center using preformed EV parts so that various models can be made quickly and cheaply.

<a href="/image/arpaw94c.gif"><img border = 0 align=left src="/image/arpaw94c1.gif"></a><b><i>CAN'T DRIVE 55 -- ARPA Program Manager Richard Cope burns rubber in CALSTART's running chassis.</i></b></blockquote></i></b><br clear = all><br><p>

<img align=right src="/image/gage.gif"><b><i>"CALSTART recognized the economic and environmental benefits to be gained from the emerging industry of advanced transportation.  CALSTART serves as an example of how the consortium process works, showing how innovative transportation projects can go quickly from paper to prototype." -- Michael J. Gage President and CEO, CALSTART</i></b><p><br clear = all><br><p>


It is fitting that the nations oldest and largest advanced transportation consortium originated in California.  Always on the leading-edge, California finds itself once again facing issues in advance of the world: severe air pollution, defense downsizing, and fundamental changes in the global economy.<p>
These liabilities have actually created major opportunities for the Golden State.  Through CALSTART, it is taking its considerable skills in defense, aerospace and other high-tech industries and applying them to a new industry.  The venture has already shown a return in hundreds of jobs created and thousands more coming, leadership in world-leading technologies, and vehicles on the road that significantly improve air quality.  <p>

<h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>The CALSTART Mission</FONT></h3><p>
CALSTART is a state-wide, non profit consortium dedicated to creating an advanced transportation technologies industry in California that will create high-quality jobs, clean the states air, and improve economic competitiveness.  CALSTART accomplishes its goals by tapping the skills and experience of Californias world-leading defense, aerospace and high tech industries and teaming them with the entrepreneurial spirit for which the state is famous. <p>
This charter has launched CALSTART in just over two years from its original 40 participants to well over 100 firms and organizations.  In that time CALSTART and its private and public partners have created and operated more than 15 major technology programs totaling more than $60 million (mostly privately funded), pushing forward technologies for electric, hybrid electric and natural gas vehicles and systems.  The results have been measured in real products built, placed on the streets and demonstrated, and real companies growing, finding markets and beginning to sell those products.<p>
ARPA is just one of CALSTARTs public partners, but its an important one.  ARPAs approach to innovation matches CALSTART's: seek out the best thinking and technologies; create strategic teams of companies to quickly develop prototypes and products; focus on performance, not paperwork; and operate a network of shared knowledge to maintain industry momentum.<p>

<h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>Accomplishments</FONT></h3><p><ul>
<li> Successful roll-out of the running chassis, essentially the "guts" of an electric vehicle minus the body and interior, proving that a fully capable electric vehicle can be affordably produced in consumer volumes.  Estimated final price with body and interior is under $18,000.  The 7 1/2 month development cycle sets a standard for rapid production;
<li> Nine electric pick-up trucks deployed and operating at Edwards Air Force Base, California's famous flight test center, proving out dual-use capabilities;
<li> hree hybrid electric buses completed and ready for delivery to Vandenberg Air Force Base, the West Coast space launch site.  Vehicles incorporate electric drive systems with a clean, on-board CNG-powered charging system for extended range.  Two commercial hybrid electric buses are under development, to use different drive/generator combinations;

<a href="/image/arpaw94d.gif"><img border = 0 align=right src="/image/arpaw94d1.gif"></a><blockquote><b><i>SWORDS INTO PLOWSHARES -- Sacramento Electric Transportation Consortium fleet pickup and a Stealth Fighter.</i></b></blockquote><br clear = all><br><p>

<img align=left src="/image/arpaw94e.gif"><blockquote><b><i>"The Sacramento Consortium has embraced the vision of 'dual-use' technology development, demonstrating it as a practical reality by developing super efficient composite vehicles, better batteries and state-of-the-art fuel cells for transportation use." -- Mike Wirsch Project Manager, SMUD</i></b></blockquote><br clear = all><br><p>

Utilities throughout California have demonstrated their commitment to alternative fuel vehicles not just to provide the "fuel" for tomorrow's vehicles, but to increase the peak efficiency of their own power generation, and, just as important, to meet the needs of their customers who want cleaner air.<p>
The Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD) has taken a clear leadership role in electric transportation research and development.  It has led the formation of a unique public/private effort which utilizes the technological capabilities of the Sacramento Air Force Logistics Center (SM-ALC) housed at McClellan Air Force Base.  <p>

<h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>The Sacramento Consortium Mission</FONT></h3><p>
Already a model for "dual use" technology, the Sacramento Consortium has successfully leveraged federal funds with millions of private dollars to dramatically enhance electric transportation technology research and development on a national scale.  This venture seeks to:<p><ul>
<li> Provide for a stronger national defense through economic and energy security;
<li> Develop advanced, efficient electric vehicle components and charging infrastructure to minimize utility system impacts of military and civilian electric vehicle charging;
<li> Create and maintain jobs for the nation, state, community, and SM-ALC; and
<li> Improve air quality throughout the nation.<p></ul>

<h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>Accomplishments</FONT></h3><p>
The Sacramento Consortium's significant success to date is attributed to a systems approach to satisfying diverse consumer needs while applying valuable dual-use technologies in the commercial sector.  For the military, drive element flexibility, reduced vehicle silhouette, signature and volume, as well as increased mobility and deployability are considered.  For the commercial side of "dual-use", project goals include consideration of fuel economy, efficiency, air quality, manufacturing scenarios, safety and military benefits --  as many "commercial" vehicles are used to perform various military tasks.<p>

To date, Sacramento accomplishments include:<p><ul>
<li> Developing a lightweight, safe, freeway-capable electric utility pickup, utilizing structural composite materials. The market potential is more than 80,000 units for both military and civilian uses;  
<li> Placing a pre-production prototype vehicle into service in May 1994.  The vehicle is being road and lab tested, and has a range potential of 100 - 155 miles per charge;  
<li> A redesigned second phase prototype vehicle will be in service by April 1995, meeting 1996 FMVSS standards.  Full production assembly is feasible by 1998;
<li> Field testing advanced lead-acid Horizon batteries in 12-16 vehicles within SMUD and McClellan Air Force Base fleets.  These long-life batteries offer marked improvement in vehicle range, efficiency and performance in "real-world" tests;
<li> Producing six hundred of these batteries at a pilot plant; over 36,000 are expected to be produced in 1995.  Site evaluation is underway to locate a full-scale manufacturing facility;
<li> Developing the world's first electro-mechanical flywheel battery (EMFB) intended specifically for vehicular applications;
<li> Designing an optimization model for this flywheel battery that has identified an optimum storage capacity of nearly 4 kWh per unit at minimal cost, in a unit weighing less than 100 pounds; and
<li> Fabricating a vacuum test fixture for the EDU and developing and testing a high-efficiency motor/generator  at speeds approaching 100,000 RPM. <p></ul>

<h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>Future Directions</FONT></h3><p><ul>
<li> Internationally acclaimed Oak Ridge National Laboratories is developing a lightweight, durable rotor.  A fully operational EDU is scheduled for availability by April 1995;
<li> A clear "dual use" example is the development and demonstration of a hybrid-electric propulsion system in a M113 Personnel Carrier;  
<li> 48 three-wheeled neighborhood electric vehicles (NEVs) have been field and market tested.  A four wheeled, higher speed vehicle has been designed and is due for completion and testing by January 1995;  and
<li> The Sacramento consortium is developing advanced proton exchange membrane fuel cell stacks that will be smaller, lighter weight and more cost effective than current fuel cell technologies. This work is expected to result in the development of a transportation-use fuel cell that will significantly increase EV efficiency and range while providing jobs within the aerospace industry.<p></ul>

<a href="/image/arpaw94f.gif"><img border = 0 align=right src="/image/arpaw94f1.gif"></a><blockquote><b><i>RACING TOWARD THE FUTURE -- Live on ESPN, the Notre Dame formula lightning race car whips around the fourth corner turn at Indianapolis Raceway Park in August 1994.  The  Electricore Inaugural Formula Lightning Race was the nation's first televised electric automobile race.</i></b></blockquote><br clear=all><br><p>

<img align=left src="/image/arpaw94g.gif"><blockquote><b><i>"When we gave Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt the keys to a clean electric tram at a wildlife refuge, we were expanding the market niche uses of advanced transportation vehicles.  Electricore is working to keep opening people's eyes about what's possible now."  -- Ellen G. Engleman Executive Director, Electricore</i></b></blockquote><br clear=all><br><p>



<blockquote><b>While the 'Silicon Valley' may be in 
			California,<br>the 'electric fields' will 
			be based on Mid-America."  </b></blockquote><p>


So state the goals of Electricore, the Mid-America Electric Vehicle consortium.  Based in Indianapolis, Indiana, Electricore's participants from 17 states seek to help U.S. automakers reach the critical mass needed to successfully introduce electric vehicles in the region where many of these vehicles may first be built.<p>
Electricore is closely allied with industry participants which include the recently announced AC Delco Systems merger of Delco Remy and AC Rochester to focus on EV/hybrid vehicle technology and alternative fuels.  In addition, General Motors has formed Delco Propulsion Systems, based in Indianapolis, consisting of AC Delco Systems, Allison Transmission and Delco Electronics to coordinate the development of components and propulsion systems and offer sales and marketing of EV batteries, motors and related systems.<p>

<h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>The Electricore Mission</FONT></h3><p>
Electricore is committed to rapidly developing and deploying electric vehicle technology  and products both at home and abroad.  It seeks to create thousands of jobs in Mid-America, significantly improve the environment through the reduction of toxic emissions and, as EVs become a major part of the American transportation system, reduce the nation's dependence on foreign oil.  <p>
Serving as a technology catapult, Electricore is also a successful economic development tool for the region, partnering technological and manufacturing expertise in the unique partnership with ARPA. Over $8 million worth of projects are now being developed with ARPA.  Additional opportunities are now being considered in excess of $10 million.<p>
Electricore pulls together the managerial and technical expertise of its participants, which range from small start-up companies to major corporate manufacturing entities.  While Electricore's manufacturing partners focus on the development of technology for EVs, its utility partners, like the rest of ARPA-supported consortia nationwide, work to design and develop the appropriate infrastructure needed to support the vehicles, whether they be cars trucks or buses for military and commercial applications.<p>
<h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>Accomplishments</FONT></h3><p>
Electricore's accomplishments include:<p><ul>
<li> Partnering with General Motors EV technicians, Electricore worked to establish a land speed record for EVs over 1,000 kg.  Using the GM Impact automobile and AC Delco Systems batteries, the car surpassed all expectations when it achieved a closed course land-speed record of 183.075 mph;<p>
<li> The Cleveland Electric Formula Classic was won by the University of Notre Dame electric formula race car, sponsored by AC Delco Systems. Utilizing advanced technology and batteries, the race car won the pole position with an 85.8 mph lap speed and hit a top speed of 110 mph, winning over 15 other university entries;<p>
<li> Electricore provided a specially designed, all electric tram to the Department of the Interior for use in the Patuxent Wildlife Refuge in Maryland.  The first of its kind, this quiet, non-polluting all-electric vehicle will be used in areas which are environmentally sensitive and contain species on the endangered list.<p></ul>

<h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>Future Directions</FONT></h3><p>
Electricore plans to deploy 15 mid-size electric powered pickup trucks and electric and hybrid electric buses.  Seven trucks will be field tested at both the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division in Indiana and at the Tank Automotive Command base in Michigan.  The hybrid electric powered shuttle buses will be evaluated in real life, real time testing situations in Indianapolis, Indiana and Chattanooga, Tennessee.<p>
Electricore has also created a unique educational program called "Teach the Technology" which partners engineers and students grades 5-12 and in universities to demonstrate the advantages of EV technology and interest students in engineering and EV-related technology careers in science, math, engineering and manufacturing.<p>
Electricore is negotiating with two major cities to use electric vehicle transportation for public transit activities and is expanding its community outreach to increase public awareness of EV technology and its benefits through enhanced communication with government officials, community leaders and economic development specialists.<p><ul>

While Detroit will always remain the "Motor City," there are many excellent reasons why every region of the nation will contribute to the growth of todays transportation industry and the evolution into tomorrows.  Helping spur this evolution from the nations Southern region are the companies, universities and governmental groups making up the Southern Coalition for Advanced Transportation (SCAT). <p>
 Organized in 1993 by Georgia Power Co. and a handful of regional companies, SCAT has grown to include 45 leading utilities, universities and manufacturers ranging from small converters to some of the worlds largest firms.  Together they are working on over $24 million in joint research projects and demonstrations, including a major electric vehicle fleet to support the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta.<p>

<h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>The SCAT Mission</FONT></h3><p>
A key focus of SCAT has been to further the development of dual-use technology  components and systems that serve not only commercial vehicle markets but also meet emerging requirements for our nations defense.
In the latest bidding to the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA), 17 projects proposed by SCAT were selected. These projects will total about $15 million, with over half of the funding coming from SCATs members.
The new research is in addition to last years $9 million for electric vehicle technology projects  $4 million from ARPA and the balance from SCATs members.

<h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>Accomplishments</FONT></h3><p><ul>
<li> SCAT teamed with the Northeast Alternative Vehicle Consortium and the Hawaii Electric Vehicle Demonstration Project to develop and demonstrate a rapid-charging system by Electronic Power Technology, Inc. (EPTI) that permits complete vehicle charging in less than 20 minutes. Using the EPTI system, a 24-hour worlds distance record for EVs of 832 miles was set at the Atlanta Motor Speedway in a Solectria pick-up truck powered by advanced sealed lead-acid batteries from GNB Battery Technologies;
<li> GNB and FMC Corporation worked with SCAT in converting an M113 armored personnel carrier to battery-powered electric drive in time for field demonstrations at the 1994 Clean Air Grand Prix and EXPO in Atlanta.<p></ul>

<h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>Future Directions</FONT></h3><p>
SCATs future ARPA projects are designed to improve overall battery system economics by reducing manufacturing costs and improving performance of batteries and battery charging:<p><ul>
<li> A Virginia team led by Virginia Power will develop a method of combining  EPTIs efficient pulse charge strategy with the GM Hughes inductive charging system to increase net charging efficiency; the system will then be evaluated in an EV using GNBs batteries; 
<li> A Florida East Team led by the Florida Alliance for Clean Technologies and Florida Power & Light will produce a high-efficiency, 200 kw rapid charger capable of mass production at low cost. This team will also develop a "smarter" charging system by which all batteries in a pack are kept equally full and by which EVs switch from battery to flywheel to auxiliary fuel as driving needs dictate;
<li> A Texas Team led by the University of Texas Center for Electromechanics will develop a lightweight, efficient flywheel battery and install it in a hybrid electric transit bus.<p></ul>
Overall, SCATS projects target some of the most important components for emerging electric and hybrid vehicles, including:<p><ul>
<li> Variable field alternators and fuel cells for electric and hybrid EVs;
<li> Power control for motor and ancillary systems, energy management/communication;
<li> Composite flywheel battery manufacturing;
<li> Advanced, efficient charging systems in conductive and inductive battery charging;
<li> High-performance electric drives; and
<li> Lightweight composite plastics for chassis and shells.<p></ul>
All components will be developed and tested on existing SCAT-ARPA platforms as well as on new state-of-the-art buses, airport support equipment and a "highly mobile multi-wheeled vehicle" commonly known as a HMMWV or "humvee."

Sheila Lynch, Executive Director, NAVC</i></b></blockquote><br clear=all><br><p>





The Northeast United States, with its large defense-oriented sector, is poised to find new business, markets and export products in the  upcoming industry of advanced transportation.  The Northeast Alternative Vehicle Consortium (NAVC) helps focus this industry and technology activity in a region ranging from New Jersey to Maine, and reaches out to participants across the Eastern United States.  It is helping define a leadership role for the Northeast in alternative fuel vehicle technology and development.   <p>

<h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>The NAVC Mission</FONT></h3><p>
The Northeast Alternative Vehicle Consortium (NAVC)  is a non-profit association of private/public firms and agencies, working together to promote the advancement of alternative fuel vehicle technologies in the Northeast. <p> 
NAVC's mission is to:<p><ul>
<li> Strengthen the Northeast economy by supporting the creation of highly-skilled technology jobs in the region;
<li> Increase the use of clean-fuel vehicle technology within the Northeast corridor, to help reduce the region's serious air quality problems; and
<li> Expand energy fuel and transportation planning possibilities by the use of alternative fuel vehicles.<p></ul>

<h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>Accomplishments</FONT></h3><p>
In November 1993, and with the support of the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA), NAVC initiated its $11.45 million technology and demonstration program for advanced transportation.  The four-phase program includes:<p><ul>
Part 1: Vehicle demonstrations (pickup trucks, buses, utility vans and passenger vehicles) and infrastructure implementation (electric recharge and a natural gas refueling station) at a military site: Hanscom Air Force Base in Bedford, MA.<p>
Part 2: Civilian pilot projects, testing various vehicles and performance criteria, in each of the six New England states and New York City.<p>
Part 3: Several technology development projects, including lightweight composite vehicles, development of an AC drive system, and a hybrid electric lightweight composite bus.<p>
Part 4: Several educational and informational activities, designed to share developments with other regions, industry and general public.<p></ul>
NAVC has also just released the results of a crucial production cost analysis study of near-term electric vehicle costs.  Prepared by the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy and Tufts University, the report concludes that no dramatic technology improvements are necessary to lower electric vehicle costs.  It found that by 1998 electric vehicle costs will drop substantially, on the order of 35-45% even at conservative production levels, due to economies of scale.<p>
In addition, the study found that, with the exception of the major automakers, current electric vehicle prices range from $15,000 to $45,000.  It also concluded that a converted commuter car costing $22,500 in 1994 should cost roughly $12,500 in 1998, with total purchase, operation and maintenance costs of 17- cents per mile, comparable to the 16-cents a mile expected for similar conventional vehicles. <p>

<h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>Future Directions</FONT></h3><p>
A new funding award from ARPA has enabled the consortium to operate more than $25 million in projects for the advanced transportation industry.  At least 12 new projects will now be able to get underway in the Northeast. These projects include:<p><ul>
<li> Testing and modeling of a lightweight electric vehicle for broad manufacturing capability;
<li> Developing a low-cost, effective modeling program for design and testing of composite body components to meet safety standards;
<li> Upgrading flywheel motor size for bus and heavy-duty vehicle applications;
<li> Providing thermal management for electric vehicles suitable for cold (and hot) weather climates;
<li> Developing and testing EV supercapacitors;
<li> Conducting design testing on hybrid variable reluctance motors;  an
<li> Several projects addressing motor controllers.<p></ul>

<P>
That's the goal for America's military, and it also
applies more than ever to how advanced military technologies are
developed, produced and deployed. Given current budgets, <U>it's
a must</U>.</FONT>
<P>

<img align=left src="/image/arpas95c1.gif" alt="CAPTION = New technologies overcome the old in a
unique partnership between ARPA and consortia nationwide.">
<P>The Advanced Research Projects Agency - ARPA - is
developing critical new technologies faster, smarter, and better
today in a unique cost-shared partnership with industry. As a
result, its projects are placing more advanced electric and hybrid
electric drive systems and technologies on the road than anyone

in military and civilian missions across the nation.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>Innovative Regional Teams</FONT></h3>
<P><ul>
<FONTCOLOR=#000000>ARPA has made this happen by helping
create and support innovative regional teams of technology developers.
These consortia are made up of defense and aerospace firms, hi-tech
companies, national and private labs and universities, utilities
and others. Their task: push the limits on new drive systems and
vehicles. </FONT>
<P>
The results of these efforts are substantial technology
improvements developed quickly at minimal public investment. </FONT>
<P>
What's the critical need for this technology? ARPA
has looked over the horizon and found America's current ground
vehicle systems will be obsolete in just 10 years. What America
needs now for military preparedness is a headstart on what will
move tomorrow's combat vehicles.</FONT>
<P>
What will survive on the battleground of the future?
Something that's quiet... stealthy... ultra-efficient... fast...
requires less logistical support... and can power the next generation
of smart, powerful offensive/defensive capabilities. The answer
is advanced electric drive systems.
</FONT>
<P></ul><h3>
<FONT COLOR=#808080>Leading-Edge Capabilities</FONT></h3>
<P><ul>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>But there's more to the ARPA consortia
than just rapid technology development. Just as important is creating
a flexible manufacturing base to support future military needs,
a base that can support itself in the marketplace while still
providing leading-edge capabilities to America's defense.</FONT>
<P>
This is possible because the very same technologies
so vitally important to our national defense are also critical
to America's industrial and environmental future. These drive
systems have tremendous commercial uses in clean, efficient transportation
systems, as well. That mutual need not only provides the market
base that lowers costs, it's helping speed development and innovation
times tremendously.</FONT>

Hawaii has had a close relationship with the U.S.
Armed Forces long before it became the 50th state. And today,
that association is more prevalent than ever, making the Aloha
State a natural to serve as the hub for one of the seven consortia
on the ARPA team. </FONT>
<P>
All military services are represented within a 375-square
mile area adjacent to Honolulu and stand ready as the power projection
base for the Pacific Theater. To that end, the Hawaii Electric
Vehicle Demonstration Project (HEVDP) is developing technology
for military vehicle application and demonstrating capabilities
on commercial and military vehicles. </FONT>
<P>
Managed by the High Technology Development Corporation,
an agency of the State's Department of Business, Economic Development
and Tourism, the HEVDP Consortium has 40 participating companies/agencies
representing 11 states throughout the country.<BR>

<P>
The advanced transportation technologies industry continues to
expand rapidly, driven by military requirements for more capable,
stealthy vehicles, and by global needs for cleaner, more efficient
transportation.  CALSTART- the nation's largest advanced
transportation consortium - continues to be on the leading edge
of this growth, both in new companies and new capabilities.

<P>
<h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>The CALSTART Mission</FONT></h3>
<P>
CALSTART is dedicated to enhancing the advanced transportation
technologies industry it helped jumpstart in California. It currently
operates 17 different programs in these key areas: electric, natural
gas, and hybrid vehicles, infrastructure and technologies and
Intelligent Transportation Systems. The goals are to create high-quality
jobs, clean the air, and improve economic competitiveness. </FONT>
<P>
CALSTARTis a new business model. It serves
as the link for a highly skilled, diverse network of more than
120 companies and organizations, which works as a flexible &quot;virtual&quot;
organization, rapidly able to respond to military and commercial
technology needs and opportunities.
<P>

<img align=left src="/image/arpas95g.gif"><blockquote><b><i>CALSTART rolled out the nation's first fully integrated
natural gas/electric &quot;hybrid&quot; buses now used as military
transports at Vandenberg Air Force Base.</tt></i></b></blockquote><p><br clear = all><p><br clear = all>
<P>




<h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>Accomplishments</FONT></h3><p><ul>

<li> CALSTART placed the nation's first fully integrated hybrid buses in
December, 1994 at Vandenberg Air Force Base. The three military
transports use an electric drive system coupled to an on-board
natural gas-powered generator. The bus can operate on batteries
alone, on the generator alone, or on both. Combined range nearly
triples that of an electric bus, while cutting diesel pollution
by as much as five times;<p>

<li> Advanced commercial bus variants of the
hybrid drive system are under construction
and due for roll-out soon. One bus will use the FMC high-power
AC drive system, a proven military design whose commercial uses
will help greatly reduce its cost;</FONT>
<P>

<li> An advanced 24kW turbogenerator from NoMac Energy Systems approaches completion. This extremely low-emission turbine generator can operate on multiple fuels, serving as the main power generator on a hybrid vehicle. Integration
of a unit aboard a Vandenberg hybrid bus will allow side-by-side
testing of performance with variant systems. AlliedSignal is completing
its own turbogenerator design;
<P>
<li> The &quot;running chassis&quot; is rapidly moving from prototype
to production phase, with orders for well over 100 of the
electric vehicle chassis and drive systems. The lightweight, aluminum
space frame design is providing a flexible platform for electric
vehicle models;
<P>
<li> Performance, operations and use data is being developed on a fleet
of electric pick-up trucks in service at Edwards Air Force Base
and its Flight Test Center. The vehicles serve flight-line and
other duties at Edwards;
<P>
<li> The Hughes multi-vehicle charging &quot;kiosks&quot;
are completed, with the first one deployed
and operational in Northern California at the Walnut Creek BART
site. The kiosk can control eight, with capacity up to 16, independent
vehicle charging units from the central site.<p></ul>

<h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>Future Directions</FONT></h3>

<p>

CALSTART continues to develop new projects in the most crucial areas of technology development, including ultracapacitors, an energy management controller for hybrids, and zinc-air batteries, among many others. </FONT>
<P>
In natural gas technologies critical to the industry,
CALSTART teams were recently picked for four of seven ARPA development
projects, including sensors and innovative chassis designs.</FONT>
<P>
CALSTART also continues to build relationships with vehicle makers
and those who will use advanced vehicle systems. As one example,
BMW and CALSTART recently co-hosted an Environmental Vehicle Partnering
Workshop to bring together key developers in this new industry.

<h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>Paving The Way for a Thriving New Industry</FONT></h3>

<P>
Combining the electric transportation technology
experience of the Sacramento Municipal Utility District and the
advanced research and development capabilities of McClellan Air
Force Base, members of the Sacramento Electric Transportation
Consortium have made great strides toward developing electric
transportation technologies. This broad&#173;based consortium
is paving the way for a thriving new U.S. manufacturing industry
while enhancing our nation's military readiness.<BR>
</FONT>
<P><h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>The SMUD Mission</FONT></h3>
<P>
The Sacramento Consortium has successfully leveraged
federal funds with millions of private dollars to dramatically
enhance electric transportation technology research and development
on a national scale. Its goals:<P><ul>

<li> Stronger national defense through technological superiority, economic
and energy security;
<P>
<li> Develop advanced, efficient EV components and charging infrastructure
to minimize utility system impacts of military and civilian EV
charging;</FONT>
<P><li> Utilize existing advanced technologies and
highly trained personnel throughout the nation and at McClellan
Air Force Base; </FONT>
<P><li> Improve air quality nationwide.</FONT>
<P><li> Aerojet General Corporation and H Power Systems have begun their project
to develop very compact proton exchange membrane fuel cell stacks
utilizing integrated fluid management made possible by Aerojet's
platelet technology. The consortium is installing a unit in an
existing composite-based vehicle fueled with compressed hydrogen.
This will result in the consortium's first hybrid EV.

</FONT>
<P><h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>Advanced Lead-Acid Battery Testing and Development</FONT></h3><p>

A pack
of <I>Horizon </I>advanced lead-acid batteries, produced by Electrosource,
Inc., has been range-tested in the Sacramento Consortium's composite
<I>Pickup I. </I>With 80% depth of discharge, the vehicle can
travel in excess of 110 miles on a single charge in city traffic
averaging approximately 40 mph.</FONT>
<P>
During the same tests, the vehicle achieved an astonishing
9.23 miles/DC kWh. This high level of efficiency is due partly
to the ultra-efficient battery system, including the high in&#173;out
efficiency of the Horizon batteries, ultra-efficient charging
system and the efficient design of the vehicle itself.</FONT>
<P>
<h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>Purpose&#173;Built Composite EV</FONT></h3><p>
A full&#173;scale model of the Sacramento Consortium's second
generation purpose&#173;built, composite, lightweight and safe
electric vehicle, the <I>Pickup II, </I>was recently unveiled
at the Los Angeles International Auto Show. A fully functional
vehicle will be completed May, 1995. The first generation vehicle
has been in operation since May, 1994, and is operating as a test-bed
for &quot;real&#173;world&quot; testing of the <I>Horizon </I>battery.</FONT>
<P>
The newest, most advanced composite pickup was rolled&#173;out
in May, 1995 in Washington, D.C. A similar vehicle is expected
to be available for fleet purchases in the next two to three years.</FONT>
<P>

<h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>Electromechanical Flywheel Development</FONT></h3><p>

An engineering test unit is being developed for performance
testing. Recently, a prototype motor/generator has completed high-speed
testing exceeding 60,000 rpm. The rotor design has been completed,
materials have been selected and rotor fabrication and testing
will be completed by late Spring, 1995. Progress on other components
is leading toward completion of the Engineering Development Unit
by November, 1995.<BR>

<h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>Neighborhood Electric Vehicles</FONT></h3>
<p>

Pacific Electric Vehicles
has designed and built a four&#173;wheeled neighborhood electric
vehicle based on the Danish three&#173;wheeled City&#173;El. Additionally,
a prototype neighborhood EV is scheduled for delivery this summer.
This economical composite materials-based vehicle will accommodate
two passengers plus about four cubic feet of cargo; be designed
for forty&#173;plus mph cruising speed; and be designed to satisfy
federal safety standards. This vehicle will be ideal for non&#173;highway
travel on military bases and campus&#173;type settings as well
as neighborhoods throughout the nation.us_<BR>

<h3><FONT COLOR=#808080></FONT></h3>

<P>
ARPA's electric and hybrid vehicle program is producing
tangible results in the South as technologies developed by members
of the Southern Coalition for Advanced Transportation (SCAT) begin
to roll at military bases and other locations. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>

<h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>Military Base Deliveries</FONT></h3>

<P>
The Air Force Alternative Fuels Systems
Program Office at</FONT><B> Robins Air Force Base
took delivery in March of its first electric pickup</FONT></B>,
a Dodge Dakota conversion by Georgia Power Company containing
the new Westinghouse Electric Corporation 100-hp AC induction
drive train. This vehicle will soon be followed by two identical
trucks and a <B>31-foot diesel hybrid-electric bus </B>being built
by Metrotrans, Spartan Motors and General Electric.</FONT>
<P>
&quot;I was really impressed with the performance,&quot;
said Major General William P. Hallin, after taking his first spin
in an all-electric pickup. The vehicles will be rotated among
three different directorates at the busy base, which supports
a SAC bomber wing and an avionics group in addition to the Air
Force's worldwide vehicle directorate. All of the vehicles will
incorporate advanced data acquisition systems, providing data
to ARPA's National Data Center on vehicle performance throughout
the base testing period.


<h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>Buses Loaded With Technology</FONT></h3>
<P>
An all-electric shuttle bus will also debut in April
as one of the campus shuttle buses on Atlanta's Georgia Tech campus.
The 32-foot &quot;Stinger&quot; has been built through a partnership
forged under the ARPA program between Westinghouse and Blue Bird
Corporation, a partnership which has already fostered the nation's
first all-electric purpose-built school bus.

<P>
<B>The Tech shuttle bus features all-electric air-conditioning,
a wheelchair lift, 0-50 acceleration in 30 seconds, and an impressive
range of 70-80 miles between charges.</FONT></B>
It also features a rapid recharger engineered by Westinghouse
utilizing Electronic Power Technology's efficient charging system,
allowing an electric &quot;fill-up&quot; in under two hours.</FONT>
<P>
<B>EPTI's efficient pulse charging system</FONT></B>
is also being installed by the owner-operator of the nation's
fastest growing fleet of electric shuttle buses, the Chattanooga
Area Regional Transit Authority. Located inside CARTA's shuttle
park south facility, the 200kW charge system will allow &quot;topping
off&quot; during regular shuttle stops at the station, furthering
SCAT's research into optimum battery charging techniques. Another
unit is destined for Florida's Patrick Air Force Base while a
test unit will go the Naval Surface Warfare Center in Crane, Indiana
for controlled testing with a wide array of battery chemistries
and manufacturers.<p>

<h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>Future Directions</FONT></h3>
<P>
SCAT's members have also begun work
on a number of other projects destined for military settings,
including an advanced hybrid-electric HMMWV (&quot;humvee&quot;)
from Alabama's Pentastar Electronics for the Army's Tank and Automotive
Command and AC induction-powered electric tow tractors from Georgia's
Tug Manufacturing for Robins Air Force Base.

<P>
While complete vehicle systems are among SCAT's highest priorities,
advanced technologies &quot;under the hood&quot; will offer advantages
for military and commercial customers alike. New fuel cell systems
from Florida's Sustainable Power Systems will provide for stealthy
auxiliary power systems, a must for range extension in commercial
settings and a clear asset in tactical and combat settings. New
flywheel systems from a team led by the University of Texas at
Austin will provide load leveling for cars, buses and locomotives
as well as storage for massive pulsed power systems in development
for the military. Advanced motors and controllers will provide
performance superior to today's technologies, and battery management
and charging systems will extend range and improve storage system
costs for vehicles from trucks to armored transports.<BR>

is a non&#173;profit association of private/public companies and
agencies working together to promote the advance of alternative
fuel vehicle (AFV) technologies in the Northeast United States.
<P>

<h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>The NAVC Mission</FONT></h3>

<P>

NAVC's mission is to:</FONT>
<P><ul>
<li> Strengthen the Northeast economy by supporting
the creation of highly skilled technology jobs in the region;
</FONT>
<P>
<li> Increase the use of clean&#173;fueled vehicle technology within
the Northeast corridor to help reduce this region's serious air
quality problems; </FONT>
<P>
<li> Expand energy fuel and transportation planning possibilities by
the use of alternative fuel vehicles.<p></ul>

In partnership with the Advanced Research Projects
Agency (ARPA) of the U.S. Department of Defense, NAVC has enabled
over $29 million of alternative fuel vehicle projects to begin
in the Northeast in the last two years alone. The Northeast is
a natural region for EV/hybrid development. With its traditionally
large defense&#173;oriented sector, its network of universities
and high technology firms, and its air quality problems, the Northeast
has many reasons to move forward through NAVC to develop EV/hybrid
technology projects. These ARPA programs provide economic development,
technology advances and new opportunities for the region.<BR>

<h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>Future Directions</FONT></h3>
<P>
A major market focus of NAVC will be heavy-duty vehicles.
Last December NAVC established its Northeast Clean Bus Committee.
NAVC plans to explore, with bus suppliers, transit authorities,
utilities and others, the opportunities for greater clean fuel
bus operations. This market is also of great interest to the military
because of similar powertrain requirements.</FONT>
<P>
Finally, NAVC is working to expand its links with business partners
in the region on infrastructure development and other market issues.
The ARPA technology programs are providing the foundation for
this emerging dual-use market.<p>

<P>
When it comes to advanced technologies, America must remain the leader.  Technology innovation is the cornerstone of continually modernizing our military - and maintaining our ability to compete in the world economy.
	Whether the battlefield is military or economic, our future success depends on a new generation of combat vehicle capabilities - hard to detect, easy to deploy and support, fast and maneuverable.
<P>




<b>A Partnership That Works</b> 
	<p>In a unique, results-oriented partnership with industry, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is successfully accelerating America's technical progress in advanced vehicles.  The vehicle on this cover - and the technologies highlighted in this report - are examples of that fast track progress.</p>

<blockquote><a href="/reference/image/arpas96d.html"><img border=0 align=right src="/image/arpas96c.gif"></a><center><b>This HMMWV (Humvee) operates on a quiet, powerful, efficient hybrid-electric  drive system.  It represents the face of our future.  And it's being built now.</b></center></blockquote><br clear=all><br>


 
	<p>This HMMWV (Humvee) operates on a quiet, powerful, efficient hybrid-electric  drive system.  It represents the face of our future.  And it's being built now.</p> 

<b>A Clear Need</b>
<p>Through seven regional technology consortia (listed below), DARPA's Electric and Hybrid Vehicle Technology Program has structured the teams to rapidly spur technology advances for leading-edge products.  It is encouraging teams of companies to make them, building the civilian manufacturing support structure to ensure costs are kept low and capabilities high.</p>
	<p>DARPA sees a clear need for new military capabilities.  Future combat vehicles bring greatly increased electrical power requirements for weapons, sensors and defensive systems.  To provide that power while staying highly mobile, DARPA is combining power generation for these systems and propulsion into one system - hybrid electric.</p>
	<p>It means smaller engines running at peak efficiency.  Reduced thermal and acoustic signatures.  A doubling of fuel economy for sustainability in the field.  Lighter-weight, faster and easier to deploy vehicles.  And integrated systems with reduced cost.</p>  
	  
<b>Results Count</b> 
	<p>Through private industry cost-shared projects, the seven DARPA consortia operate a vast range of innovative research, development and deployment programs in all regions of the nation, each pushing forward advanced electric and hybrid electric vehicle technologies.</p>	
<p>What has our unique partnership accomplished?  On the broadest level, the DARPA consortia have proven out a new model for rapid technology development.  By maximizing both cooperation and competition among a skills-rich network of companies, research organizations, labs and universities spanning America, the best technologies are encouraged, quickly developed and tested.  This innovative approach has been recognized for its success by the prestigious Hudson Institute.</p>
	<p>That's the model.  What physical projects can we point to?</p>  
	<p>The pages of this report chronicle significant progress across a range of critical technology areas: </p> 
<ul>
<li><p>You'll find key, "enabling" technologies for electric and hybrid vehicles - such as low-cost power electronics.</p>  
<li><p>You'll discover a staggering array of new, efficient energy generators for hybrid vehicles - from turbogenerators to fuel cells to rotary-engine generators.</p>  
<li><p>You'll see real improvements in energy storage - from advanced lead-acid batteries to flywheel "mechanical" batteries to supercapacitors. </p> 
<li><p>You'll learn about new light-weight, high-strength materials for vehicle bodies and chassis.</p>  
<li><p>And you'll see full vehicle "integrations" - from a new military scout vehicle to Humvees to Bradley fighting vehicles, as well as a range of new clean and efficient civilian vehicles from commuter cars to buses, all able to tap the same technology base.
</p></ul> 
   
<b>Meeting Multiple Missions</b>
	<p>What each of these innovative technology projects share is that each is a part of a broader whole.  The DARPA Electric and Hybrid Vehicle Program is a flexible yet highly coordinated effort to push forward critical vehicle performance goals through increased power generation, improved energy storage, reduced weight and enhanced efficiencies.</p>  
	<p>Please read our report of progress.  We think you'll find a program showing results quickly, cost-efficiently and with an eye toward meeting multiple missions -- from improved military capabilities, to reducing oil imports and enhancing energy security, to meeting critical clean air standards.  These are missions with a future.</p>

<b>What is DARPA?</b>

	<p>DARPA stands for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, the guardian of the future for the Department of Defense.</p>
	<p>Ever heard of the Internet?  DARPA
invented it.</p> 
	<p>Designed to link national labs and researchers, it's fast becoming the global model for civilian communication and commerce.  And DARPA placed America squarely in the middle of the future.</p>
	<p>DARPA's Electric and Hybrid Vehicle Program has the same goal.  Future combat vehicles need to be stealthy, nimble and carry a huge electronic punch.  Recognizing that civilian vehicles increasingly need similar technologies to cut air pollution and reduce dependence on foreign oil, DARPA launched a program to encourage those technologies to be developed and built in the United States.</p>
	<p>The track record to date?  Over 350 American companies are working together - and in competition with each other - to push the limits of energy storage, drive system efficiency and high-power electronics for combat vehicles.</p>
	<p>Maybe just as important - companies around the world are now launching into these same technologies.  That's a sign of their importance and a testament to DARPA's scanning of future needs.</p>
	<p>Just as with the Internet, DARPA is giving us the early lead.  Now we must maintain it, to keep the edge in military capabilities and to carve out another area of commercial leadership in the global market.<P></p></ul>

<H3 align = center><FONT COLOR=#FF0000>Latest Projects Bring Critical Technologies to the Next Level</FONT></h3>
<P>


	<p>CALSTART's partnership with DARPA is pushing forward a range of technology projects to meet the next level of key power and performance goals required not just for military vehicles, but commercial vehicles as well.</p>


<p><blockquote><a href="/reference/image/arpas96-2b.html"><img border=0 align=right src="/image/arpas96-2a.gif"></a><center><b>The Joint Tactical Electric Vehicle (JTEV) will be used to test high-risk components for a new military hybrid reconaissance vehicle.</b></center></blockquote><br clear=all><br></p>




	<p>CALSTART continues the rapid pace of advanced vehicle and technology development.  Within the last year, we placed the nation's first fully integrated hybrid buses at Vandenberg Air Force Base, developed advanced turbogenerators to serve as the main power generators for hybrid vehicles, and installed a multi-vehicle charging kiosk at a transit station in Northern California.  </p>

	<p>This year, CALSTART's partnership with DARPA is pushing forward a range of technology projects to meet the next level of key power and performance goals required not just for military vehicles, but commercial vehicles as well.  CALSTART was particularly successful in advancing flywheel and auxiliary power unit (APU) technologies and hybrid-electric electronics components in the latest round of DARPA-partnered projects.</p>

<p><h3 align><FONT COLOR=#808080>The CALSTART Mission</FONT></h3></p>


	<p>CALSTART's core mission is a broad one: to create a new advanced transportation industry, bringing with it cleaner air and high quality jobs.  As a critical component of this effort, we focus our DARPA programs on advancing electric and hybrid-electric vehicle technologies to meet military and commercial needs. To make this happen, CALSTART acts as an advanced transportation industry "solution provider" that quickly taps its network of more than 185 participating companies and organizations to obtain the resources needed for custom-made, market-oriented solutions to technology barriers.  CALSTART provides these services to the advanced transportation industry:

<ul>
<li> Technology assessment
<li> Strategic partnering
<li> Business incubation
<li> Launching and managing technology projects
<li> Networking and education opportunities
<li> Information services and marketing, including a major Internet Web Site at http://www.calstart.org that is updated twice daily.
</ul>

</p>

<p><h3 align><FONT COLOR=#808080>Accomplishments</FONT></h3></p>


<p>Evidence of these solutions can best be seen through the participants that have led this year's technology drive:

<ul>
<p><li> CALSTART launched the nation's first electric station car program with the San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit District. The first 12 purpose-built EVs are on the road and the final 28 will be delivered later this year.</p>

<p><li> Building on an earlier DARPA program, CALSTART has built two new EV chassis: one for advanced urban vehicles and one for low-cost to Asian countries.</p>

<p><li> CALSTART opened a business cluster at the Alameda Naval Air Station, the base's first civilian reuse project.  The site houses eight businesses in advanced transportation.</p>

<p><li> Capstone Turbine of Tarzana, Calif., developed a compact, lightweight advanced turbine for heavy-duty hybrid electric vehicles, providing equivalent range of conventionally fueled vehicles but with dramatic performance, energy efficiency, and emissions improvements.</p>

<p><li> Jefferson Programmed Power, now at the Alameda Naval Air Station, is developing a programmable DC controller and software to help improve the performance and extend the range of electric vehicles with DC drive trains.

</ul></p>
</p>

<p><blockquote><a href="/reference/image/arpas96-2f.html"><img border=0 align=left src="/image/arpas96-2e.gif"></a><center><b>The Moller rotary-powered auxiliary power unit may enable 70 mile per gallon hybrid vehicles with near-zero emissions</b></center></blockquote><br clear=all><br></p>


<p><h3 align><FONT COLOR=#808080>Future Directions</FONT></h3></p>

<ul>

<p><li> Rocketdyne/Rockwell Corporation of Seal Beach, Calif., will conduct safety and containment testing of a low-cost titanium flywheel using a unique rotor design which allows the flywheel to fail in a very safe mode. </p> 
<p><li> U.S. Flywheel Systems in Newbury Park, Calif., will test four different high-energy density composite rotor flywheel energy storage systems to determine durability and failure modes.  The systems have a projected capability of enduring 10,000 charge/discharge cycles.</p>
<p><li> AVCON will manufacture and test magnetic bearings for four flywheel projects at its Agoura Hills, Calif. facilities to improve the performance of high-speed magnetic bearing systems.</p>
<p><li> Coriolis Corporation of Saratoga, Calif., will demonstrate a low-cost high-voltage circuit breaker that could be used as a battery safety switch, with strong applications to high-powered vehicles such as trucks and tanks.</p>
<p><li> Moller International of Davis, Calif., will develop a very low-emission rotary-powered auxiliary power unit engine for hybrid electric vehicles.  The unit will be tested to determine if target goals of more than 70 miles per gallon and equivalent zero-emissions vehicle emissions are met. </p>
<p><li> Aerovironment Inc. in Monrovia, Calif., and Rod Millen Motorsport will evaluate and test a wide range of high risk components for the second generation Advanced Hybrid Electric Reconnaissance Vehicle (AHERV).  The companies will test traction motors and batteries, among others, in the existing Joint Tactical Electric Vehicle.</p>
<p><li> Alturdyne of San Diego, Calif. will build a 40 kW rotary power unit as a power generator which will be tested aboard a next generation hybrid electric bus.</p>
</ul>	
	<p>CALSTART will continue to help develop critical technologies while also working to encourage large-scale deployment of clean fuel vehicles in market segments where they work best.</p>
	<p>We will also continue to provide the base of information services and education that encourage industry growth, particularly through expansion of our Internet Web Site for Advanced Transportation.</p>

<FONT FACE="Helvetica"></FONT></h3>





<p>Recognized as an industry leader, our consortium has combined the technological capabilities of McClellan Air Force Base, the experience of the Sacramento Municipal Utility District  and the innovation of many private companies to realize the advantages of electric transportation.</p>

<p>Enhancing the nation's military readiness while creating a new industry is among the many substantial benefits derived from the broad-based multilateral effort.  </p>


<p><blockquote><a href="/reference/image/arpas96-3d.html"><img border=0 align=right src="/image/arpas96-3c.gif"></a><center><b>Electrosource is developing the Maximizer battery management system into a robust automotive component.</b></center></blockquote><br clear=all><br></p>



<p><h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>The Sacramento Mission</FONT></h3></p>


	
<p>The Sacramento Consortium's objectives go hand-in-hand with those of the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles (PNGV).  To date, the Consortium has successfully leveraged federal funds with millions of private dollars to dramatically enhance electric transportation technology research and development on a national scale.  Its goals:
<ul>
<p><li> Stronger national defense through technological superiority, economic and energy security:
<li> Develop advanced, efficient EV components and charging infrastructure to minimize utility system impacts of military and civilian EV charging;
<li> Create and maintain jobs for the nation, state, community and McClellan Air Force Base;
<li> Improve air quality nationwide.</p>
</ul>

</p><p><h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>Accomplishments</FONT></h3></p>
<ul>

<p><b>Fuel Cells</b></p>
<p>Testing of H Power Systems' 10 kilowatt proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell stack continues. This stack design will lead to a larger 50 to 70 kilowatt system for test and demonstration in buses.  Additionally, an advanced, multi-fuel processor to convert liquid hydrocarbons to hydrogen for the fuel cell is under development.  	Key to both stack performance and cost reduction are the use of patented platelet technology to reduce separator plate mass and meet cost targets for mass produced systems.</p>

<p><b>Advanced Lead-Acid Batteries</b></p>
<p>Field testing is continuing to prove out the Horizon batteries in a variety of SMUD/McClellan vehicles, including sedans, trucks and vans.  Horizon batteries, produced by Electrosource, Inc., deliver the highest specific energy of any advanced lead acid battery  available for electric vehicles.</p>

<p><b>Electrosource S-Fold Battery for Hybrid Vehicles</b></p>
<p>Development of this technology will result in a battery with high voltage and high specific power, with respect to battery volume and mass (750 to 1,000 w/kg), which is 3 to 4 times greater than its nearest competitor.  This battery model will enable successful operation of PNGV hybrid vehicles in the future.</p>

<p><b>Purpose-built EVs</b></p>
<p> A second generation electric pickup truck, Pickup II, premiered at the 1995 DARPA conference. It is a two passenger, lightweight, all-composite vehicle with the following dimensions:  155" long, 62" high and 61" wide. Already road-tested and receiving rave reviews from fleet users, the Pickup II has front wheel drive, a curb weight of 2,100 pounds, Horizon batteries, Brusa motor (gt20-T) and controller (AMC325), safety glass, and 14 inch aluminum wheels with Michelin Proxima tires.</p>
<p>	A multi-year effort to take the Pickup II to production has been initiated, utilizing as many OEM subsystems and components as possible.  The composite process required for large structural components is being developed and the vehicle is being redesigned for improved manufacturability and cost-effectiveness.</p>

<p><b>EV Testing & Data Collection</b></p>
<p>  Both monthly energy logging and detailed "time-series" data collected for in-depth study of EV performance is yielding valuable information.   This project has been expanded to upgrade monthly logging hardware, add 8 more vehicles to the "time-series" study program, and develop systems to automatically record performance data from fleet EVs.  "Time-series" data systems are able to record 20-40 individual measurements throughout the vehicle every 200 milliseconds.  This data will allow the analysis of entire vehicle performance as well as subsystems within the vehicle and is needed for new vehicle development efforts, utility power planning, fleet operations planning and infrastructure development.</p>

<p><b>Sacramento Battery Test Facility</b></p>
<p>Equipped with two AeroVironment ABC 150 Advanced Battery Cycler Test Systems this new facility is capable of cycling four battery packs in a variety of cycling regimes such as hybrid EV and rapid charge cycles.  Several new battery management systems developed to maximize capacity and protect life of electric vehicle battery packs will be tested and evaluated here.  Additionally, SMUD will field test the Electrosource Maximizer Battery Management System being developed to ensure longer life for advanced batteries.  It will charge each battery in a pack individually to achieve maximum capacity from the battery pack on every cycle.  Voltage and temperature sensors on each battery are used to provide an accurate "state of charge" reading for the driver.  This proven system is being developed to the robust automotive component stage for the EV industry.</p>

<p><b>Electromechanical Flywheel Battery</b></p>
<p> A working engineering test unit will soon be completed.  Due to substantive progress made by American Flywheel Systems, Inc. since 1995, the fabrication of a flywheel rotor system is scheduled for completion by mid-1996, with testing of an electromechanical flywheel battery engineering unit to begin thereafter.</p>

<p><b>Neighborhood Electric Vehicles</b></p>
<p> Pacific Electric Vehicles is scheduled to complete its Peregrin prototype in May of this year.  This economical monocoque composite chassis is a low performance, 40+ mph two passenger vehicle suitable for residential neighborhoods and campus-type settings.</p>

<p>	Electricore, the Mid-America Electric Vehicle Consortium, is successfully building the foundation for true development of the necessary technologies, industrial base and support infrastructure for a viable commercial electric/hybrid-electric vehicle industry.</p>

<p><blockquote><a href="/reference/image/arpas96-4b.html"><img border=0 align=right src="/image/arpas96-4a.gif"></a><center><b>Electricore's participants span the United States, from California to Massachusetts.</b></center></blockquote><br clear=all><br></p>



<p>	This industry is integral to the development of cost-effective military electric and hybrid-electric vehicle applications.  As military demand, alone, will not be large enough to support a defense-unique industrial base, the Electricore consortia partnerships have successfully developed advanced technology systems from the lab to the marketplace, yielding the technology "guts" required for both military and civilian applications.</p>
<p>	Successful project developments include advanced batteries specifically designed for electric vehicles, special battery monitoring packs and safety improvements which have had ground-breaking impact.  Technology developments are having actual impact on the market. In January, 1996 General Motors introduced the EV-1 -- the first production electric vehicle introduced by one of the "Big Three." Two Electricore participants supported the development of the technologies used in this vehicle via design of the electric drive motor system, a drive motor and gear set designed to produce the vehicle with the smoothest possible acceleration. </p>
<p>	Development of the battery pack system occurred concurrently alongside the development of the drive unit and includes a purpose built, deep-cycle, maintenance-free, valve-regulated, lead-acid recombinate battery. This battery is the first of its kind in the market and is the same system used in the DARPA military bus projects.</p>
<p>	The successful marriage of key developmental technologies with civilian markets has underscored the importance of dual use technologies. Current projects which will impact both the military and civilian markets include:</p>

<ul>

<p><h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>Electric Variable Transmission</FONT></h3></p>
<p>	Led by Allison Transmission, the system offers efficiency benefits over the conventional powertrain for high average power vehicle applications. This scalable technology is appropriate for military applications for a HMMWV, a five ton truck or a 25 ton tracked vehicle or civilian applications for a 30' or 40' city bus.
</p>
<p><h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>High Efficiency Air Conditioning</FONT></h3></p>
<p>	Led by Nartron, this advanced high efficiency, microprocessor controlled, turbine driven, modular air conditioner will meet both electric bus requirements, all types of military vehicles including surface, air and watercraft such as locomotives and rail cars, heavy duty trucks, off road equipment, shipboard tower mounted electronics, fixed wing and non fixed wing aircraft.</p>

<p><h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>Synchronous Reluctance Motor</FONT></h3></p>
<p>	Led by Delphi Energy and Engine Management Systems, the SRN represents a new motor design which combines novel manufacturing processes, new composite materials and new control strategies to mass produce advanced motors with optimized efficiencies at lower cost and weight than similar induction motors. These motors will be suitable for electric and hybrid electric military and civilian vehicles including all but the largest tracked military vehicle applications</p>
<p><h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>Non-Invasive Battery Measurement Technology</FONT></h3></p>

<p>	Led by Premium Power of Slidell, Louisiana, this project is developing a new non-invasive technique to measure battery state-of-charge called "Time Domain Spectroscopy."  This technology has many potential applications in all areas of electrochemistry including military electrochemical storage units, quality control in battery manufacturing, accurate on-board electric vehicle "fuel" gauge, as well as medical applications.
</p>

<p><h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>Advanced Mos-Gated Thyristers</FONT></h3></p>

<p>	Led by Rutgers University, this project is designing and fabricating a novel MOS-gated Thyristor, using a SiC wide bandgap semiconductor for high power and high temperature applications in electric vehicles.</p>
<p><h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>Electric/Hybrid Vehicle Virtual Proving Ground</FONT></h3></p>

<p>	Led by the University of lowa, the virtual proving ground focuses on the Army's high mobility Multi-purpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV) with an experimental electric/hybrid drive train. The virtual proving ground is designed to support hybrid-electric vehicle systems, including development of drive train, energy storage, and motors, carrying out simulation based trade off analysis and design optimization.</p>

<p><h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>Lower Management and Storage Systems for Hybrid Electric Drives</FONT></h3></p>

<p>	Led by SATCON, the program develops and tests hybrid electric drive system control and energy storage for a wide variety of military and commercial vehicles using flywheel energy storage units.</p>

	<p>Electric and hybrid-electric vehicle development is truly a national phenomenon, with commercial and military activities firmly moving in all corners of the nation, and the Southern United States region is no exception.</p>

<p><blockquote><a href="/reference/image/arpas96-5b.html"><img border=0 align=right src="/image/arpas96-5a.gif"></a><center><b>GM's Impact was previewed in several Southern markets during 1996 to set the stage for the EV1's launch in 1997.</b></center></blockquote><br clear=all><br></p>



	<p>In the Southern region, GM's decision to go into production on the EV1 sedan and electric S-10 pickup have sharpened the focus on both critical technology development and market realities.  While the focus of much public attention is drawn to the racy EV1 which will initially be offered for sale only in California and Arizona, utilities and other electric transportation partners are already installing infrastructure for the eventual sale of EVs throughout the sunbelt.</p>

<p><h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>Production Ramping Up In the Region</FONT></h3></p>


	<p>Although the EV1 will be produced in Michigan and initially be sold only in the Southwest, the electric pickup will be manufactured in Louisiana and be offered for sale to fleet customers throughout the nation. </p>
	<p>GM's moves have helped create a "race to market" atmosphere which is helping "pull" technologies developed through the DARPA program into commercial and military platforms.</p>
	<p>For example, Chrysler will be counting on AC induction drive trains developed in Maryland by Northrop Grumman (formerly Westinghouse Automotive Systems) and advanced lead-acid batteries from Texas-based Electrosource to power its 1997 model EPIC electric van.</p>

<p><blockquote><a href="/reference/image/arpas96-5d.html"><img border=0 align=left src="/image/arpas96-5c.gif"></a><center><b>Pentastart's high performance hybrid-electric HMMWV featuring advanced lead-acid batteries from Electrosource and permanent magnet motors from Unique Mobility.</b></center></blockquote><br clear=all><br></p>



  
	<p>Electrosource batteries are also at the heart of several military vehicle prototypes, including hybrid-electric HMMWVs being developed by Alabama-based Pentastar Electronics, a division of Chrysler, and a hybrid-electric M113 armored personnel carrier converted by United Defense.  When completed this summer, the HMMWV is expected to outperform conventional HMMWVs in several areas, including speed, maneuverability, stealth, and gradability.  Its permanent magnet motors from Unique Mobility will deliver twice the horsepower to the wheels than the conventional drive system, with three times the overall efficiency.</p>
	<p>Small, efficient permanent magnet motors developed by Fisher Technologies entered production to meet the need for more efficient climate control systems on Ford Ranger upfits by Troy Design & Manufacturing.  High efficiency alternators and traction motors also developed by Fisher under SCAT's DARPA program are being considered by other manufacturers for heavy duty vehicles, including buses.</p>

<p><h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>DARPA Program to Cut Bus Drive Train Costs </FONT></h3></p>


<p>	Electric bus shipments are picking up quickly with sales for 1996 looking to double or triple 1995's figures.  Northrup Grumman is in production in Puerto Rico with its 200KW AC drive train for Blue Bird school buses and transit-style buses, manufactured in Fort Valley, Georgia. General Electric has entered the shuttle bus drive train market with AC induction inverters and motors on buses built by Chattanooga's Advanced Vehicle Systems.</p>
<p>	Both Northrup Grumman and GE are participants in DARPA-funded programs to dramatically slash the price of their heavy-duty drive trains.  These programs focus on reducing parts count, integrated chip design, advanced motor controls, and smarter power electronics.  The GE system, being developed in conjunction with Analog Devices and IXYS, will produce open architecture components for the industry, including a new motor control chip, smart IGBT modules, and a new low-cost AC inverter package.  The goal is a minimum 50% reduction in price, with increased performance, over today's drive package</p>

<p><h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>New Cooperative Thrusts Hasten Technology Development & Market Readiness</FONT></h3></p>


<p>	New SCAT research focus areas include battery management systems, larger battery packs for heavy duty vehicles, flywheel containment testing and a continuation of SCAT's pioneering work in pulse charging techniques.  The flywheel containment program involves development teams from every region of the nation, combined with several national labs, in an DARPA/DOE coordinated program of controlled destructive testing to develop affordable approaches to flywheel containment design.</p>
<p>	SCAT is also increasing its contributions to the DARPA modeling and simulation system, with new emphases on advanced batteries, pulse charging, and multiple drive trains.</p>
<p>	In response to requests by SCAT's 50 plus members, the organization is also expanding its program focus to include major thrusts in education and infrastructure development, including coordinated training programs for residential code officials, and a program of coordinated web page development with the other DARPA 
consortia.</p>

<p>

<p>	The MARCAV regional consortium joined DARPA in July, 1995 to aid the United States in advancing electric and hybrid-electric drive systems and technologies.</p>


<p><blockquote><a href="/reference/image/arpas96-6b.html"><img border=0 align=right src="/image/arpas96-6a.gif"></a><center><b>The hybrid-electric HMMWV, operating in a battery-only mode, eliminates fuel fumes and motor noise, making it difficult for enemy detection.</b></center></blockquote><br clear=all><br></p>

<p>	The MARCAV consortium is operated by Concurrent Technologies Corporation (CTC), an independent nonprofit organization in Johnstown, Pennsylvania. MARCAV develops, demonstrates, and deploys advanced transportation technologies nationwide to improve environmental air quality, increase energy security, rejuvenate the U.S. civil-military industrial base, and increase vehicle performance, particularly for the defense industry.</p>

<p><h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>MARCAV Mission</FONT></h3></p>

<p>	The mission of MARCAV is to pursue research and development technology that will:</p>
<ul>
<p><li> Develop advanced vehicles and components that approach competitiveness with conventional internal combustion engines, on both cost and performance;</p>
<p><li> Demonstrate that clean vehicles can be produced which are attractive to the commercial and military markets; and</p>
<p><li> Provide a mechanism so that innovative technology and entrepreneurial businesses can be developed alone or in partnership with other U.S. industry, leading to the enhancement of the U.S. civil-military industrial base.</p>

</ul>

<p><h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>Developments for Future Defense and Commercial Applications</FONT></h3></p>

<p>	MARCAV's focus on the civil-military industry is illustrated through its many projects. Examples of projects making great progress include the Hybrid Electric High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV), the Utility Electric Vehicle and the Hybrid Electric Bradley Fighting Vehicle.</p>

<p>	The HMMWV, supported by CTC, focuses on converting a conventional HMMWV to hybrid electric power. In other words, the components of the internal combustion engine will be replaced by a smaller diesel motor-generator set in series with dual electric motors. The energy needed for mobility will then be provided through advanced lead-acid batteries. This will minimize the use of imported oil which, in turn, helps the environment, our national security, and our trade deficit. In addition, the Hybrid Electric HMMWV will be capable of operating in a battery-only mode, giving it the ability to move undetected on the battlefield  a huge advantage for U.S. defense operations.</p>

<p>	The Utility Electric Vehicle project, supported by the Keystone Consortium, focuses on demonstrating the feasibility of an all electric, all composite vehicle designed for commercial on-the-road use. This vehicle's low-weight composite structure will enable the vehicle to travel at speeds up to 70 mph. The Utility Electric Vehicle was recently honored at the Composite Fabricators Association Convention with the 1995 Technical Innovation Award, while placing third overall at this international show.</p>

<p><blockquote><a href="/reference/image/arpas96-6d.html"><img border=0 align=left src="/image/arpas96-6c.gif"></a><center><b>Twenty-three of the utility electric vehicles are to be produced within the next three years, using three for crash tests and 20 for road tests.</b></center></blockquote><br clear=all><br></p>

<p>	The Hybrid Electric Bradley Fighting Vehicle project, supported by United Defense, L.P., focuses on converting a standard Bradley Fighting Vehicle to a hybrid electric drive. The objective of this conversion is to demonstrate the automotive and operational advantages of a hybrid electric drive for tracked combat vehicles. The Hybrid Electric vehicle will be enabled by high power density electric drive components developed for heavy-duty applications  a necessity for such combat vehicles.</p>

<p>	MARCAV's developments do not stop here. MARCAV is working on a number of other projects to help improve and upgrade the design, development, and manufacture of defense and commercial electric and hybrid electric vehicles. These include the Hybrid Electric M113 Demonstrator, High Capacity Hydrogen Storage Demonstrators, Fixed Speed Ratio Transmission, Polymer Multi-Layer Capacitors and Batteries, and the implementation of Integrated Product and Process Design (IPPD) throughout the consortia. The newest member to MARCAV's family of projects is the Flywheel Energy Storage System project, focusing on the development of secure flywheel containment units.</p>

<p>	MARCAV's progress on its electric and hybrid-electric vehicle projects is sure to be consistent and abundant. MARCAV looks forward to continued opportunities with the other DARPA consortia and in the defense market.</p>

<p>The Northeast Alternative Vehicle Consortium (NAVC) is a non-profit association of public and private companies and agencies, working to promote the advance of alternative fuel vehicle technologies in the Northeast United States.</p>



<p>	<b>NAVC's mission includes:</b></p>

<ul>
<p><li> strengthening the Northeast economy by allowing for the transfer of existing workforce skills out of exclusively defense related areas and into highly skilled clean-fuel vehicle related jobs with commercial/defense dual-use marketing potential;</p>
<p><li> meeting the region's air quality goals through the use of clean-fueled vehicles;</p>
<p><li> taking advantage of the Northeast's wealth of technology innovators and get them working together.</p></ul>




<p>In partnership with DARPA, NAVC is now managing over $32 million in alternative vehicle technology initiatives.</p>

<p>Through NAVC, this diverse group of organizations can move forward, linked by a common interest in furthering technologies for clean air, sustainable energy/energy security, technological competitiveness and economic development.
</p>


<blockquote><a href="/reference/image/arpas96-7b.html"><img border=0 align=right src="/image/arpas96-7a.gif"></a><center><b>A soldier demonstrates Hughes' easy-to-use inductive charger at Ilanscom Air Force Base.</b></center></blockquote><br clear=all>








<p><h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>Accomplishments</FONT></h3></p>

<p>	NAVC has expanded its program of advanced transportation technology with nine new projects for 1996.  This latest addition to the program brings the total of NAVC-managed projects to nearly 50.</p>

<ul>

<b><p>The Northern Region Thermal Management Technology Project</p></b>

<p>	An ongoing NAVC project that, due to its impressive results thus far, has received funding under this award to expand its program.  The project is managed by EVermont and the Atlantic Center for the Environment.  Vermont's cold, rural environment makes it ideal for the testing and development of advanced thermal management technologies vital to the successful operation of military and civilian EVs.</p>

<p><blockquote><a href="/reference/image/arpas96-7d.html"><img border=0 align=right src="/image/arpas96-7c.gif"></a><center><b>NAVC has provided funding for this charging station which supports a fleet of electric pickup trucks and vans at Hanscom Air Force Base.</b></center></blockquote></p><br clear=all><br>





<b><p>Nickel Metal Hydride Battery Testing in a Cold Weather Environment</p></b>
<p>	Research by Michigan's Ovonic Battery Company has shown no performance loss in nickel metal hydride batteries in temperatures as low as -20 degrees Fahrenheit.  In this project, the Massachusetts Division of Energy Resources and EVermont will test this finding in day-to-day applications.  The initiative also involves testing the nickel metal hydride batteries in hot weather.
</p>

<b><p>Conversions of Sport Utility Vehicles</p></b>

<p>	The New York City Department of Environmental Protection, Wilmington, Massachusetts-based Solectria Corp., Boston Edison, and Hanscom Air Force Base in Bedford, Massachusetts will collaborate on a series of conversions to optimized electric vehicles.  The conversions will be performed at Solectria, followed by testing and analysis at Hanscom AFB, then delivery to New York City and Boston for operation and data collection.  Solectria plans to add the converted sport utility vehicle to its product line, to be available at reduced cost for both military and civilian applications.</p>


<p><blockquote><a href="/reference/image/arpas96-7f.html"><img border=0 align=left src="/image/arpas96-7e.gif"></a><center><b>NAVC is funding development and crash testing of the Solectria Sunrise all-composite electric vehicle.</b></center></blockquote></p><br clear=all><br>

			

<b><p>High Efficiency, High Voltage DC Motor/Controller Design and Development</p></b>

<p>The revolutionary technology results in a motor/controller that exceeds the performance of current technology, yet costs less to produce and also eliminates the need for a conventional transmission. Solectria is working on several concepts in this program.</p>

<b><p>Integrated High Voltage Power Electronic Module</p></b>
<p>	Will provide dramatic cost reduction, simplified installation, and increased safety.</p>

<b><p>Single-Processor Fully Digital AC Motor Controller</p></b>
<p>	Involves redesigning the motor controller to make it fully digital, add computational power, and lower the cost.  The process will simplify manufacturing and produce a more efficient and user-friendly motor/controller system.</p>

<b><p>Horizon Battery/Vehicle Validation</p></b>
<p>	Using Horizon batteries, a battery management system and other related technologies, the system will feature increased range and improved life.  The ambitious initiative aims to establish market viability in just six months.</p>

<b><p>High Voltage Variable Speed AC to AC Motor Drives</p></b>
<p>	D.C. Transformation, Inc. of Beverly, Massachusetts, is doing ground-breaking work on motor drives for military applications.  This project will include a traction drive inverter demonstration.  The payoff of this amazing technology is reduced weight and volume, extreme cost reduction, increased efficiency and superior regulation, control and protection capabilities.</p>

<b><p>Electric Vehicle Monitoring and Display System Commercialization</p></b>
<p>	To be developed by New London, Connecticut's Naval Undersea Warfare Center, the Connecticut Municipal Electric Energy Cooperative, the Thomas G. Faria Corporation of Uncasville, Connecticut, and Solectria Corp.  The team will use their combined expertise to develop a cost-effective instrumentation panel to be used in the Solectria Sunrise, but also adaptable to other vehicles.</p>

</ul><p>	NAVC has also had great success recently with ongoing projects.  A notable example is the NAVC-sponsored Solectria Sunrise, which recently added crashworthiness to its list of remarkable achievements.  The 4-passenger sedan had extremely encouraging results in crash testing.  The damage to both the vehicle and the crash-test dummies were well within allowable limits.  </p>
<p>	Production composite vehicle structures are of great interest to the military for stealth and lightweight strength.  </p>

<p><h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>Future Directions</FONT></h3></p>

<p>	NAVC will continue outreach to further the DARPA military needs of low-cost hybrid and electric vehicle technology and continue to meet the needs of the Northeast for economic development and cleaner air.</p>

: : The item I saw was The News Hour with Jim Lehrer, and the production run quoted was 500, not five thousand.
: : : Saw the 'Zebra' 2-seater white all-electric car on the business news tonight.  A price was mentinoned and a production run of 5000 coming up - I am interested!!!! The report did not mention manufacturer but that most electric cars are under the CALSTART umbrella. Can you help me? CALSTART should have an index of car names so if a person sees one on the tv we can get in touch.

<B>Project Title: Design Optimization and Proof Testing of
Safety Containment Systems for Flywheel
Energy Storage Systems (FESS)  <p>

Performing Organization: Tribology Systems, Inc.  <p></B>

Technical POC: Lewis B. Sibley<br>

Phone: (610) 889-9088 <br>

Fax: (610) 993-0860 <p>

<B>Project Summary:</B><p>

The TSIproprietary FESS safety containment design consists of a computer
coordinated system of several simple, lowcost, yet powerful devices, combined in a unique manner,
for the safe dissipation of all the flywheel kinetic energy at full FESS design speed. The initial design
analyses are now completed, and the first proof test will be conducted with WFC s commercial
stationary FESS containment system using an intentionally defective, 500Wh gross energy, 30,000rpm
maximum design speed flywheel, to simulate the highly unlikely event of a catastrophic composite ring
failure in service. Second and third proof tests are planned on the current project, with design
modifications based on the results of the first test, and including lightweight containment materials. A
key characteristic of our system is a simple, lightweight device that absorbs flywheel energy at an initial
computed rate greater than a megawatt and is designed to activate in 0.2 millisecond after the ruptured
flywheel friction torque on its crash ring starts to rotate the containment housing in its own bearings,
designed to survive 1.8 million pounds shock load, twice the maximum possible impact of a ruptured
flywheel fragment. 
<p>
The entire FESS for stationary applications is mounted inside a square cabinet on the floor, with a
special design to provide immediate self centering of the flywheel fragments while they still have
significant kinetic energy. In this way, the initial impact unbalance will last no more than a millisecond or
two, and will have no more serious effect on the assembled unit than a Design Optimization and Proof
Testing of Safety Containment Systems for Flywheel Energy Storage Systems (FESS) washing
machine walking across the floor in its spindry mode. The contact surfaces of the flywheel on the crash
ring will have a TSIpatented, zerooutgassing, solidlubrication system to prevent excessive damage and
heating of the interface, and to minimize flywheel disintegration. 
<p>
After the flywheel disintegrates into a fluidlike slurry, its maximum possible residual kinetic energy has
been computed and converted into a centrifugal pressure inside the containment housing and the
resulting loads on the housing capscrews. Analysis shows that the computed maximum stress in the
housing is a factor of four below the ASME boiler code allowable stress and the capscrew loads are a
factor of five below their rated breaking strength. Testing will be performed at Oak Ridge National
Laboratories and will include highresponse recording and highspeed photography of all critical
parameters in the testing of our complete systems, so that we can improve the accuracy of our
analyses and learn how to simplify and reduce the weight and cost of our system for EV and HEV
applications. <p>

<B>Project Deliverables:</B> <p> Final report giving all the results of the analyses and tests, including generic
engineering rules for FESS containment designs for both stationary and lightweight vehicular
applications.  <p>

<B>Project Schedule:</B> <p><ul><li> The first test will be performed June 1996, the second in September 1996, and
the third test and final report will be completed during December 1996.</ul>

<B>Project Title: Polymer MultiLayer Capacitors and Batteries  <p>

Performing Organization: Sigma Labs, Inc. <p></B>

Technical POC: Ted Miller<br>

Phone: (520) 575-8013 <br>

Fax: (520) 742-0975 <p>

<B>Project Summary:</B><p>

Sigma Labs' PML technology is progressing toward the production of extremely
high performance energy storage devices. PML refers to a production process and type of material
consisting of multilayers of polymer and metal (typically 1 M/layer). The composition of both the
polymers and the metals can be tailored for specific applications. We are targeting two devices in this
project; a high energy density electrostatic capacitor, and an ultra thin film lithium battery.  <p>

Capacitor <p>

ML capacitors are constructed with multilayered polymer dielectrics and thin film metal electrodes.
The short term energy density goal is 1 Wh/kg. The long term energy density goal is 20 Wh/kg. The
long term power density goal is 1 MW/kg. By virtue of discharge times on the order of microseconds,
we have already achieved 5 MW/kg discharges in lab experiments.<p>

Battery <p>

Lithium battery electrochemistry is being develCapacitor Poped with thin film polymer and
polymercomposite battery components that are PML compatible. The unique PML processing can
exploit thin film geometry on a bulk materials scale that cannot be achieved with any other materials
production technique. A direct consequence is extraordinarily high power density. While the project
goals are 400 W/kg, a much higher power density is expected without loss of energy density. The
project energy density goal is 200 Wh/kg.<p>

<B>Project Deliverables:</B> <p> Deliverables are best effort devices targeting the goals described above. 

The capacitors will be multilayerdevices. The batteries will be single cell thin film devices made with
PML compatible materials. <p>

<B>Project Schedule:</B> <p><ul><li> The project was initiated in June 1995 and will conclude June 1997.</ul>

traction motors and auxiliaries while providing consistency in achieving high system efficiency and operational
stability. SatCon believes that the Power2 system has wide dual use potential for military and commercial
vehicles; thus it forms the heart of SatCon's DualUse, Modular Hybrid Electric Drive Train, which is being
developed for commercialization. </P>

<P>Advances in electronic controls, electric power devices and materials have led to a wide spread interest in electric
and hybrid electric drive systems that take advantage of the compact, light weight nature of such drives and their
highly efficient operating characteristics. The benefits for both military and commercial vehicles are plentiful,
including improved fuel economy, cleaner operation, and higher power capability in smaller, lighter packages. With
the thrust towards broad use of electric power for weapons, onboard sensors and survivability systems on military
tactical vehicles, utilization of electric and hybrid electric propulsion offers the synergistic opportunity to optimize
power generation and control and take advantage of these benefits.</P>

<P>Through SatCon market research on hybrid drives, it was recognized that the majority of viable hybrid drive trains
could be characterized with some sort of power input from a heat engine/generator, some power
management/control and energy storage function, and some type of electric traction motor. It became apparent
that if a standard, reliable approach to the central control and energy storage could be developed, a variety of
applications could be addressed with a single concept which solves the problem of multiple components working
effectively together. In addition, by standardizing this system, reliable, crossapplication system control, high
efficiency, system stability, and commonality of core components can be achieved. </P>

<P>SatCon is well on the way to producing the Power2 system in prototype form for laboratory testing and evaluation.
It will consist of a flywheel energy storage unit capable of 1.65 kWhr total stored mechanical energy (1.0 kWhr
deliverable energy), associated power electronics and flywheel controller, a system controller, and a cooling
system; as shown in Figure 1. It will communicate with four external elements; the vehicle operator, the heat
engine/generator, the traction motor, and the auxiliary power loads using the SAE J1850 network protocol. The
Power2 system will have three critical functions: 1) balance the power flow in the drive system by appropriately
controlling the flywheel, traction motor and heat engine, 2) use the flywheel to handle power flow transients to allow
the heat engine to operate at steady power, high efficiency state and, 3) control the vehicle in a responsive manner
desired by the operator. </P>

<P><B>Project Deliverables:</B></P>Following completion of the prototype development and evaluation program, the prototype
will be available for integration into a vehicle for onboard testing. Although this will not reflect final packaging of the
Power2 system, its performance can be evaluated via a vehicle test. The likely vehicle would be a walkin van,
retrofitted with a suitable heat enginegenerator and traction motor. Interface control and inverter equipment will
also be required. The vehicle thus fitted would be available for track testing only, unless provisions are made for
packaging and qualification necessary to make it roadworthy.

<P><B>Project Schedule: </B></P>The preliminary design of the Power2 system components is complete and detail design is
60% complete; procurement of materials has begun and will continue into the summer. Each component will be
tested individually and then integrated into the Power2 system test cell. System integration and test is currently
scheduled to occur Nov. 96 through May 97.

<B>Project Title:  Optimization of an Induction Motor and Sensorless Speed Operation<p>

Performing Organization:  Delphi Energy & Engine Management Systems, Delco Propulsion Systems</B><p>

<P>Technical POC: K. Rajashekara, DelphiE, (317) 5793700</P> 

<P><B>Project Summary:</B></P>

<P>The focus of this project is to develop a highly efficient and reliable motor control system for
induction motors for deployment in electric and hybrid vehicles. Application of this technology to electric vehicles will
be investigated. The feasibility of extending this technology to electric buses and military applications will also be
investigated.
</P>
<P>The main objective is to make the motor drive system operate at the highest possible efficiency at any given
operation condition. This action will take place online. Several technologies will be investigated and the best chosen
to implement the efficiency optimization schemes. Fuzzy logic and neural network control strategies shown an
enormous potential for advancing power electronics control technology. </P>

<P>Another part of the project is to investigate the operation of the motor without using a speed sensor. Speed
sensorless operation improves the reliability and reduces the cost of the overall drive system.</P>

<P>For the advancement of electric vehicle development, the single most important technology, next to the battery, is
the power converter. The power converter control system significantly affects drive characteristics, efficiency, range,
and all dynamic characteristics of the electric vehicle. It is necessary to have high efficiency, low weight, and
reliable power converters in electric vehicles.</P> 

<P>Traditionally the efficiency is optimized based on the lookup tables. In slip frequency control schemes, the motor is
run at various slip frequencies for a given speed and motor current. The slip frequencies corresponding to maximum
efficiencies for various operating conditions are stored in a lookup table. But this method depends on the motor. For
each type of motor, this experiment has to be repeated. This is time consuming. </P>

<P>In the proposed project, the efficiency is optimized by determining the minimum input power for a given output
power. The flux is varied online to make the motor operate in the linear region and also to operate at a higher
efficiency point. Under steadystate, lightload operation, the drive efficiency will be improved by reducing the flux
from the rated value so that, for the same developed torque, a balance is maintained between the motor's core loss
and the copper loss. The realtime search method of control using fuzzy logic makes control independent of
machine parameters and the adaptive control reduces convergence time. </P>

<P>Fuzzy logic control enables online changing of the operating modes of the system. This makes it possible to
operate the motor at maximum efficiency under all operating conditions. Because fuzzy logic control provides this
flexibility, it is applicable to a wide range of electric vehicle applications including cars, buses, military tanks, and
trains.</P>

<P>Neural network technology will be used for estimation of the rotor flux. The estimated flux will be used for closed
loop flux control and it can also be used for direct field orientation control of the induction motor.</P>

<P>Elimination of the speed sensor will make the system more reliable, less expensive, and more robust. The speed
sensorless operation research work has been going on for the past 20 years. However, there is no practical speed
sensorless based induction motor drive system in existence today. There is a lot of progress that has been made in
this area. The main problem is the nonlinear speedtorque characteristics of the motor and its parameter variation
with temperature, current, and frequency.</P>

<P>Delphi will work jointly with the Purdue School of Engineering and Technology at Indiana UniversityPurdue
University at Indianapolis on a computational intelligence approach to speed sensorless operation that utilizes a
neural network/fuzzy logic/evolutionary computation hybrid approach that provides a reliable, robust and inexpensive
solution despite the system nonlinearities and parameter variations.</P>

<LI>Expected to begin May 1, 1996 & continue for 2 yrs.</UL></P>

<B>Project Title: Heavy-Duty Hybrid Electric Buses<p>
Performing Organization: Santa Barbara County Air Pollution Control District
</B><p>

<P>Technical Contact: Mahesh Talwar  (805) 961-8922</P>

<P><B>Program Description</B></P>


<P>Five hybrid electric buses will be converted or built in this program for use in  three separate California locales.  The buses will be operated in both commercial and military environments for performance, range, and durability.</P>

<P>APS Systems, Inc. has converted one 28-foot and two 40-foot school bus-type transit buses at Vandenberg Air Force Base to a hybrid electric configuration.  The buses are driven by twin 50-kilowatt air-cooled APS/Indramat AC power trains, giving the buses a top speed of approximately 50 mph.  Power for the electric drive motors is supplied by lead-acid batteries, coupled to an auxiliary power unit (APU).  The APUs on these buses are Cummins 4B 3.9-liter naturally aspirated spark ignition engines, operated on compressed natural gas.</P>

<P>The buses achieve a range of approximately 180 miles, and their emissions have been tested in the range of 1.0-1.5 grams/brake-horsepower-hour of NOx.</P>

<P>APS Systems, Inc. is also developing a purpose-built 40-foot heavy-duty hybrid electric transit bus.  This bus will also be driven by APS/Indramat AC motors and controllers, with Saft nickel-cadmium batteries providing the power for the drive train.  The APU is a turbocharged Cummins 4B 3.9 liter spark ignition engine, producing 50 kilowatts of electrical power.  The engine will operate on natural gas.  The curb weight of this bus will be approximately 20,400 pounds, representing a savings of approximately 8,000-9,000 pounds from a standard bus.  The structural design of this bus is based on a smaller electric bus being constructed by APS under another CALSTART project.  The APS bus will be used in regular transit service in the City of Lompoc.</P>

<P>The fifth bus in this program is a conversion of a Gillig Phantom 40-foot transit bus.  The bus was originally specified with an FMC motor, but Gillig will now perform the conversion with a Siemens drive train.  This bus will also have a Cummins 4B 3.9 liter turbocharged engine running on natural gas for an auxiliary power unit and will include 30 kilowatt-hours of Horizon batteries for energy storage.  The bus is designed for a range of approximately 200 miles.  It will be used by the Golden Gate Transit District.</P>

<P><B>Program Deliverables</B></P>

<P>This program will produce and put into service five hybrid electric buses of various sizes, as well as the charging and refueling facilities.  Detailed operational and performance data will also be collected and summarized through the CALSTART data acquisition effort.</P>

<P><B>Program Schedule</B></P>	

<P>The three converted Vandenberg Air Force Base buses were delivered in late 1994.  The APS purpose-built bus will be delivered in the summer of 1996, as will the Gillig bus.</P>

<B>Project Title: E/HEV Emissions Studies<p>
Performing Organization: Natural Resources Defense Council	
</B><p>

<P>Technical Contact:  Veronica Kun (213) 939-6900</P>

<P><B>Program Description</B></P>

<P>In this program, the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) has led a two-phase effort to analyze and characterize the emissions associated with the operations of electric and hybrid electric vehicles, and the relative emission reduction benefits of using these vehicles instead of gasoline-powered vehicles.  In the first phase, completed in June, 1994, NRDC and Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) researchers analyzed six different scenarios of varying electric vehicle sales, vehicle efficiency levels and miles driven, and recharging patterns in California.  Under these scenarios, NRDC and EDF compared the tailpipe emissions from a gasoline-powered vehicle meeting ultra-low emission vehicle standards with the emissions from the mix of electrical power generation sources serving Southern California.  The report found that electric vehicles (EVs) reduce emissions of reactive organic gases and nitrogen oxides - the main precursors of ozone - by 97-99%, compared to gasoline-powered vehicles.  EVs also reduce the emissions of carbon monoxide, a pollutant with significant human health impacts, by similar amounts.  EVs were also found to emit 49-66% less carbon dioxide than the 31 miles-per-gallon (mpg) gasoline cars and 21 mpg trucks evaluated.  The fuel efficiency of these gasoline-powered vehicles would need to rise to 91 mpg and 41.5 mpg respectively, to match the electric vehicles analyzed.</P>

<P>In Phase 2 of this program, the NRDC will analyze the potential emissions benefits of heavy-duty hybrid electric drive-trains for trucks and buses.  This study will determine whether hybrid technology can improve the greenhouse gas and criteria pollutant emissions associated with dedicated natural gas and advanced diesel bus and truck engines.  The study will quantify the emissions and fuel economy benefits of hybrid engines in their most promising heavy-duty applications, and compare these benefits to dedicated electric battery, natural gas and diesel technologies.</P>


	
<P><B>Milestones</B></P>

<P>The Phase 1 report was completed in June, 1994.  The Phase 2 analysis and report will be completed by the end of 1996.

<B>Project Title:  Brush Testing for Magnetically Levitated Trains<p>
Performing Organization:  American MAGFV Technology, Inc., Parker Kinetic Designs, Inc.; University of Texas at Austin, Center for Electromechanics</B><p>

<P>POC: Tony Morris, Telephone (404) 4282900</P>

<P><B>Program Summary: </B></P> 


<P>The purpose of this project is to design and construct a high speed (300 mph) commutated brush
tester using as much existing hardware as possible at UT/CEM Next. we were to measure brush wear
rates and characterize brush behavior of a commercial brush material (from Morganite CMIS). of
advanced fiber brushes (from Dr. Doris Kuhlman-Wilsdorf, University of Virginia), and of homopolar
pulsed consolidated copper/graphite brush material (from UT/CEM) under commutated current
conditions and speed similar to predicted operating conditions on a Magler Train. The goal of the
project was to determine what set of brush material and operating conditions should be used as design
parameters for future rush commutated Maglev trains to provide acceptable wear life. </P>

<P>The potential benefit of conducting this test program, and carrying it further as recommended above, is
to enable the advanced cost effective magnetically levitated train concept currently under development
by American Maglev to come to fruition. Additionally, advances in brush wear behavior resulting from
this testing program will substantially improve the behavior and efficiency of other brushed electrical
machines such as continuous duty homopolar traction motors for electric vehicle applications. </P>

<P><B>DELIVERABLES:</B></P>

<P>The deliverable for this program is a final report detailing the design, construction, and testing results of
the high speed commutated brush test system.</P>

<P><B>SCHEDULE:</B>
</P><P>The project is complete as proposed (8/95).

<h3>Northeast Alternative Vehicle Consortium</h3><p>

<blockquote>

<B>Project Title: Project Sunrise<p>
Performing Organization: Solectria</B>

<P><B>Project Goals and Technologies</B></P>

<P>Solectria Corporation is a small electric vehicle and component manufacturer based near Boston, MA.
The company has sold over 200 electric vehicles, both 4 passenger sedans called the Force and light duty
pick up trucks called E10's. The company in its t year history has produced drive systems with proven
reliability for solar and electric racing vehicles, for OEM electric vehicle programs, and for its ground up
design vehicle called the Sunrise. All Solectria vehicles including the Sunrise feature Solectria drive
systems which collectively have logged well over l ,000,000 miles of onroad experience.</P> 

<P>Sunrisc is a sleek. all composite, monocoque electric vehicle It is a ground up design based on the
premise of creating a safe, affordable, high efficiency, lightweight electric sedan. Its roomy interior offers
passenger space close to the of a Ford Taurus. Its exterior utilizes a very aerodynamic tear drop shape
with a low coefficient of drag. Rite Sunrise's lightweight/cight design and advanced drive system will offer a
fleet and family electric vehicle with exceptional range at a reasonable cost. </P>

<P>Solectria designed the vehicle from initial concepts to working sketches to computer models to clay
models and then mockups before the first body was made. over the first year of the program, master
shapes were developed and initial tooling was made followed by a rolling and then a drivable prototype.
The vehicle wave first unveiled at the EVS-12 show at Disneyland in Los Angeles, CA on December It,
1994. Since EVS l 2* more bodies and prototype vehicles have been produced. </P>

<P>The Sunrise development teats has selected and tested specific composite materials to achieve both
structural requirements and cost effective manufacturing in low volumes. This proprietary mix of materials
and processes is the core of the body development area of the Sunrise program.</P>

<P>Advanced vehicle systems designed specifically for EVs have also been incorporated into the Sunrise
design. A low costair cooled AC induction drive system, a flexible battery tunnel design, passenger and
battery ventilation systems, and an advanced battery thermal management system are just some of the
innovations that are featured m the vehicle.</P>

<P>The Sunrise has proven itself by demonstrating exceptional range both on the road and in dynamometer
testing. At the 1995 American Tour de Sol race, the Sunrise equipped with Ovonic Nickel Metal Hydride
batteries traveled over 238 miles on a single charge in mixed city ant highway driving. And in recent SAE 1634 profile testing, the Sunrise with Ovonic Nickel Metal Hydride batteries traveled 199.5 miles on a single charge.</P>

<P>The Sunrise safety program has also achieved numerous milestones. Extensive modeling and actual front
end testing has shown consistent, predictable results. In late 1995, an engineering prototype vehicle was
subjected to a full vehicle 30 mph frontal impact test at an accredited facility. All passenger injury scores
were extremely low significantly less than 50% of the maximum guidelines.</P>

<P>Funding for the development of Sunrisc has come through the US Department of Defense Advanced
Research Projects Agency (ARPA) coordinated by the Northeast Alternative Vehicle Consortium (NAVC).
Sunrise is being developed with the assistance of many key industry and academic partners including
TPI, Textron, Boston Edison Company and the University of Massachusetts-Lowell. </P>

<P>The development program is continuing with the current design for manufacturing phase along with
continuation of the FMVSS test program. Systems are being refined to meet the manufacturable Cost
goals while still maintaining aggressive weight targets. Limited production is targeted for 19981999.</P>

<P><B>Solectria Electronics</B></P>

<P>Solectria has been developing advanced, high efficiency, lightweight electric vehicle
drive systems and components since 1989. These components have been placed in actual
onroad applications for well over 1,000,000 miles in over 200 vehicles built by Solectria. In
addtion, vehicles built by other large and small companies, as well as university teams etc.
have successfully put electric and hybrid electric vehicles on the road almost exclusively
using Solectria components.
</P>

<P>
ARPA's support has allowed Solectria to concentrate on innovative, low cost driven EV
electronics and drive system products to the point where they are ready for
commercialization. These component projects have been selected and executed because
they represent a significant contribution to Me technological and economic feasibility of
electnc and hybrid electric vehicles.

<h3>Northeast Alternative Vehicle Consortium</h3><p>

<blockquote>

<B>Project Title: The Northern Region Thermal Management Technology Project<p>
Performing Organization: Evermont
</B>


<P><B>Program Description</B></P>


<P>The Verrnont Electric Vehicle Demonstration Project was awarded a third grant from the
Department of Defense's Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) and the Northeast
Alternative Vehicle Consortium (NAVC) to continue further development of electric vehicle
battery and cabin thermal management systems to address issues of cabin comfort and
winter range. This grant funds the Northern Region Thermal Management Technology
Project which continues electric vehicle testing and data acquisition and technology
development in Vermont</P>

<P><B>Project Goals</B></P>

<P>The Northern Region Thermal Management Technology Project will focus on five specific
areas of electric vehicle technology development. 
</P>

<P>First, battery thermal management for lead-acid and nickel metal hydride batteries will be
analyzed and improved. Improving battery thermal management will contribute to increased
vehicle range and improved performance in cold temperatures. To address this issue, one l9^
Solectria Force vehicle will be designed with an advanced battery box to improve battery
thermal management and one 1996 Solectria Force will be powered by nickel metal
hydride batteries. </P>

<P>Second. cold weather technologies will be refined and advanced. The Northeast Advanced
Thermal Management Technology Project (NATMTP) selected and integrated fuel fired
heaters into Solectria Force sedans and determined that a S kilowatt fuel fired coolant
beater provides optimum cabin comfort. NATMTP also tested tires, low viscosity
lubricants, healed seats ant steering wheels, a desiccant wheel and thermal windshields.
The Northern Region Thermal Management Technology Project will build on these
technologies and continue to improve heat conservation and retention. Specifically, a cabin
preheat system will be advanced and adapted for a remote control, a fuel fired heater will
he integrated into an E10 pickup truck and vehicle insulation will be improved. </P>

<P>Third, the Northern Region Thermal Management Technology Project will develop a
lightweight air conditioning system to integrate with heating systems in electric vehicles.
Lightweight air conditioners will decrease vehicle weight thereby increasing efficiency and
vehicle performance. Furthermore, the integration of heating and air conditioning increases
consumer acceptance and marketability of electric vehicles. </P>

<P>Fourth, a thermal energy management control system will he investigated. Through this
investigation it will be determined whether a single control system should coordinate
battery and cabin heating. A coordinated system may be able to maximize the use of
waste heat for cabin heating. </P>

<P>Fifth, the potential utility and desirability of an auxiliary power unit (APU) will be
investigated. An APV could provide additional power to recharge and increase vehicle
range. Its waste heat could be utilized to increase cabin healing. While an APU may
improve vehicle range, its adaption into electric vehicles must also be evaluated to avoid
compromising the current lack of noise and air pollution achieved by electric vehicles.</P>

<h3>Sacramento Electric Transportation Consortium (SETC)</h3><p>

<blockquote>
<B>Project Title:  Neighborhood Electric Vehicle Project<p>
Performing Organization:  Pacific Electric Vehicles</B><p>

<P>Technical POC: William Warf (707) 4855799 </P>

<P><B>Project Summary: </B></P><P>The objective of this project is to provide a low cost composite
materials based two passenger neighborhood electric vehicle (NEV) suitable for
regional American markets. </P>

<P>An initial project task was the purchase and evaluation of 3wheel CityE1 NEVs
through use in representative fleets and privatedriver programs. Through the end of
1995, these demonstration NEVs have logged nearly 60,000 miles.</P>

<P>This initial evaluation program helped characterize driving patterns and reinforced
that an NEV can effectively meet transportation needs in many industrial, urban and
suburban environments where low performance (speed and range) is acceptable. </P>

<P>The initial evaluation also helped identify design changes that would enhance the
acceptance of NEVs across a broader market. These include modification to a
4wheel layout (to improve stability), and better driver protection (improved
crashworthiness). </P>

<P>A completely new, ground up NEV, called the Peregrin, was developed with these
changes in mind. The design is a monocoque construction capable of >40 mph 
more than adequate for surface street use.</P>

<P>The design uses conventional fibermatrix materials and processes to keep costs
down, yet the objective of satisfying Federal Safety Standards has been retained in
the design process making this the safest NEV now under development. </P>

<P>NEVs have the potential for greatly increased efficiency over traditional vehicles.
Although not targeted at the ambitious performance objectives of the PNGV, many
common areas of interest are involved in the Peregrin design. This purposebuilt
NEV can be used for design configuration and subsystem evaluation, setting the
stage for higher performance versions.</P>

<P><B>Project Deliverables: </B></P><P>The primary objective of this project is production of a
prototype NEV, the Peregrin, to be used in design development testing, market
study, and funding development. Completed activities include field testing of 40+
NEVs in public street and private industrial service. Redesign of thermoplastic
canopy tops for improved failure mode, as well as charger, battery and component
testing has been completed.</P>

<P><B>Project Schedule:</B></P> 

<P>The Peregrin prototype will be complete in May of 1996.</P>

<h3>Electricore</h3><p>

<blockquote>
<B>Project Title:  Infrastructure & Energy EndUse Metering<p>

Performing Organization: PSI Energy, Indianapolis Power & Light</B><p>

<P>Technical POC: Madelyn Harwood, PSI Energy, (317) 8381518<br>
Jim Wittman, IPL, (317) 2618214</P>

Project Summary: 

<P>PSI Energy and Indianapolis Power & Light have provided or will be providing the proper
infrastructure to support the operation of the Electricore electric pickup trucks and hybrid electric buses at the
usersites. This support includes outlet and circuit installation for each vehicle and ongoing technical support.</P>

<P>Electricore, EPRI, and PSI Energy are working in consortium with others to analyze performance parameters of
EV. PSI Energy is adding their enduse metering expertise to quantify the battery charging system. Vehicles being
tested have an onboard charging system  when the batteries approach depletion, the operator plugs the car into
any 220volt outlet and the batteries reach full charge in a matter of hours. PSI teamed with ABB to use their Alpha
electric utility reserve meter for EV charging analysis. The Alpha is an electronic meter capable of kW, kVA, and
kVAR metering. It is designed to handle a variety of voltages. A compact, redesigned meter called the Portable
Alpha emerged. It is enclosed in a tough plastic case and can meter consumption of various voltage levels. In
analyzing EV charging, the meter allows the time and date to be stored, along with the consumption during a
15minute time interval. Months of data can be stored in the meter. Data is retrieved via an optical port. </P>

<P><B>Project Deliverables:</B></P>

<P>Infrastructure support and data acquisition support for electric pickup demonstration.</P> 

<P><B>Project Schedule: </B></P><P>Ongoing & concurrently with electric pickup/bus demonstration.

<B>Project Summary:</B>
<P>
Kaman Electromagnetics Corporation (Kaman) has converted a 40
ft transit bus from a diesel engine based power pack to a hybrid
electric propulsion system configuration. Kaman was the prime contractor in the development, installation, check out, and test
of the hybrid electric propulsion system. The bus is powered by
a propane fueled rotary engine generator set and a NiCd battery
pack that feeds a Kaman PA44 drive motor and power electronics.
The motor drives the existing bus rear differential allowing for
easier vehicle conversion. The complete system provides full four
quadrant operation to permit regenerative braking as well as propulsion
in both forward and reverse.
<P>
Kaman was responsible for the complete propulsion system on the
hybrid electric bus. Engineers developed a top level system design
to fit the hybrid electric propulsion system into the existing
bus without altering passenger capacity or vehicle structure.
The operation and performance of the hybrid electric system are
similar to the operation of a conventional diesel powered bus.
Kaman developed the specifications for the system software, batteries,
battery regulator, vehicle control system, generator set, and
drive motoripower electronics. The system software is realtime
multitasking that was originally developed in accordance with
the DOD MILSTD 2167A and MIL STD 2168 software development standards,
resulting in a high level of maintainability and flexibility.

<B>Project Title:  Electromechanical Active Vehicle Suspension Program<p>
Performing Organization:  University of Texas, Center for Electromechanics State of Texas, State Match Pool
</B><p>

<P>POINT OF CONTACT: Joe Beno <BR>
The University of Texas at Austin,<br>
Center for Electromechanics<br>
Telephone: (512) 4714496

<P><B>Program Summary: </B></P> 

<P>The Center for Electromechanics at the University of Texas (UTCEM) has an ongoing program to
develop vehicle active electromechanical suspension (EMS) systems. The program began with funding
from the National Automotive Center at the U. S. Army Tank and Automotive Command to perform a
fullscale, proofofprinciple demonstration of an EMS system for an M1 tank. The demonstration
consisted of a single wheel station (equivalent to quarter car model for a convential four wheeled
vehicle), with the vehicle mass simulated by a 5 ton concrete block (the weight supported by one M1
roadwheel station). Vertical terrain displacements were simulated with a hydraulic ram. in the course
of the project, UTCEM developed a new approach to active suspension control, referred to as a Near
Constant Force Suspension, that allows simplified control strategies; does not require advanced terrain
knowledge (lookahead); and has demonstrated fourfold cross country speed increases with
simultaneous sixfold reductions in sprung mass accelerations (compared to existing M1
performance)) over very rough offroad terrain. Performance plots for the existing M1 tank wheel station
with passive suspension components (shown on left) and EMS active suspension (right) are compared
below for severe 500 foot terrain input track.</P>

<P>In our current followon project, funded by ARPA, UTCEM is adapting the concept from M1 tank
trailing arm configuration to dual Aarm configurations, as is found in commercial and military wheeled
vehicles Control strategies are being expanded to a four wheel laboratory test platform.. Experimental
results are showing similar performance benefits to the single wheel test rig The final (future) phase of
the military program would apply the results of the first two projects to a military offroad vehicle, such
as the HMMWV UTCEM has been selected for a joint TACOMARPA project to develop advanced
linear actuators that will be required for this application.</P>

<P>In a related effort, Houston Metropolitan Transit Authority (HMTA) has indicated a desire to apply the
EMS concepts to a transit bus, under the auspices of their "Next Generation Bus!' program Lotus
Engineering, with their successful experience in active suspension systems for onroad, wheeled
vehicles, is a major subcontractor in the HMTA effort This effort is schedule to start on April 1,1996. </P>

<B>Project Title:  High-Efficiency HVAC System for EVs<p>
Performing Organization:  Glacier Bay
</B><p>

<P>Technical Contact:  Kevin Alston (415) 578-0871</P>

<P><B>Program Description</B></P>

<P>Glacier Bay, the leading manufacturer of high-performance marine cooling systems, is bringing its innovative design concepts to the electric and hybrid electric vehicle market.  Glacier Bay has developed and is currently marketing an HFC-134a cooling system which has been rated by a marine products independent testing agency as the most energy efficient on the market.</P>

	<P>In this program, Glacier Bay will adapt their patented high-efficiency temperature control systems to electric and hybrid electric vehicles.  The Glacier Bay technology will produce a 50% reduction of energy consumption by the heating and air conditioning system, compared to today's most efficient prototypes; a 50% reduction in the size and weight of the system; increased heat output in cold climates (operating down to -14 C); and reduced maintenance, as a result of the hermetically sealed design.</P>

	<P>The Glacier Bay system is expected to provide an energy efficiency rating of 11.22 under severe driving conditions, with an average rating of 15 under normal operations.  This compares to a rating of 6.17 for the most efficient prototype available today, as recently tested by the Electric Power Research Institute.  The Glacier Bay system will also be designed to accommodate a range of operating voltages, obviating the need for a separate battery pack for the heating and cooling system.</P>

<P><B>Milestones</B></P>

<P>During the first twelve months of the project, Glacier Bay will design and bench test the prototype system.  By the end of the 18-month project period, Glacier Bay will test the production version in two electric vehicles.

<h3>Sacramento Electric Transportation Consortium (SETC)</h3><p>

<blockquote>
<B>Project Title:  Electrosource Maximizer Charge Management System<p>
Performing Organization:  Electrosource, Inc.</B><p>

<P>Technical POC: Rick Blanyer (512) 4456606</P>

<P><B>Project Summary: </B></P>
<P>The Electrosource Maximizer Charge Management System
(MAX CMS) was developed in 1995 to ensure longer life for advanced batteries 
a necessary and significant advance in EV/HEV technology. The project objective is
to bring the system from its present breadboard form to a road worthy state for
vehicle applications.</P>

<P><B>Benefits </B></P>

<P>
<UL>
<LI>Extends the life of valve regulated leadacid (VRLA) and other advanced batteries. 
<LI>Prevents overcharging, and monitors overdischarging. 
<LI>Optimizes performance by balancing the capacity of each battery within the pack. 
<LI>Performs diagnostics for troubleshooting. 
<LI>Records voltage and temperature excursions. 
<LI>Improves range and battery life permitting substantial cost savings for PNGV vehicles.
</UL>
</P>

<P><B>Project Deliverables:</B></P>

<P>
<UL>
<LI>Build a printed circuit board based version of the master controller using discrete components. 
<LI>Incorporate the necessary communication links for control, diagnostics and displays. 
<LI>Design the vehicle CMS installation, install the CMS, data logger and display. 
<LI>Perform a system validation test. 
<LI>Fabricate, test and install the MAX CMS in an electric vehicle operating under normal conditions.
</UL>
</P>

<P><B>Features </B></P>

<P>. Designed with a sensing/balancing node located on and powered by the battery
module itself. Nodes continuously monitor battery voltage and temperature, records
extremes, and time stamp these as they occur. </P>

<P> Master controller processes this information and manages battery charging via a
pulse width modulated (PWM) signal circuit, allowing the bulk and finishing charge
currents to be tailored for each individual battery module. </P>
<P>
Status . The MAX CMS has been tested in its breadboard form and has successfully
demonstrated its charge control and data monitoring and storage features on packs
of up to twentyseven batteries.</P>

<P><B>Project Schedule: </B></P>

<P>This sevenmonth project will provide an economical and reliable Charge
Management System that optimizes both the performance and useful life of sealed,
maintenancefree batteries.</P>

<P>Through temperature compensation and controlled charge/discharge cycles for each
battery, uniform capacity is maintained and life is extended by minimizing
overcharge and overdischarge conditions within the battery pack. </P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><I>Without BMS: </I></B></P><P>Typical battery charging systems and discharge meters tend to treat
battery packs as if they were a single battery. This, however, can be very costly. Due
to both manufacturing tolerances and temperature differences across the pack, the
actual state of charge can vary substantially. After multiple cycles, this can result in
overcharging individual batteries causing thermal degradation of the electrolyte.
Similarly, individual batteries can be overdischarged resulting in premature
electrode corrosion. In both cases, battery life is needlessly shortened, and range will
be limited by the unbalanced battery pack.</P>

<P><B><I>WITH BMS: </I></B></P><P>A Battery Management System (BMS) can extend the life of a battery
pack by treating each battery individually. The BMS measures the temperature of
each battery and tailors the charge profile delivered to each battery accordingly.
Similarly, the state of charge is measured for each battery, ensuring that no single
module is unknowingly overdischarged. By keeping the pack "balanced", and
minimizing both over charge and overdischarge conditions, the overall performance
of the battery pack is improved (up to 20% greater capacity) and life is enhanced. As
the battery pack is a high cost element of an EV, the use of a BMS can lead to
substantial savings over the life cycle.

<h3>Electricore</h3><p>

<blockquote>
<B>Project Title:  Virtual Proving Grounds <p>

Performing Organization: The University of Iowa</B><p>

<P>Technical POC: Prof. Edward J. Haug, (319) 3355726</P> 

<P><B>Project Summary:</B></P>

<P>A high fidelity virtual proving ground is being developed for prototyping family sized
automobiles with hybridelectric drives. Upon implementation, such vehicles will be simulated in the vehicle virtual
proving ground being developed by the University of Iowa, using validated electric powertrain subsystem models
and data provided by the PNGV Systems Analysis Team.</P>

<P>The goal of the project is to (1) create a proving ground design that includes high fidelity models of a family size
passenger vehicle for which conventional powertrain data are available, (2) implement in subsequent projects a
spectrum of hybridelectric powertrain models in driving simulator dynamics software with data that have been
validated by industry partners, and (3) to subsequently test and demonstrate differences between performance and
derivability of the validated conventionally powered vehicle and hybridelectric powered vehicle systems using the
driving simulatorbased proving ground. </P>

<P>For a typical hybridelectric vehicle model, the virtual proving ground will support the following capabilities: (1) A
high fidelity multibody mechanical dynamics simulation program; (2) A state space modeling capability for general
algebraic and differential equations; (3) A mathematical library that includes linear algebra, optimization and
numerical integration functions; (4) Specific technical libraries for modeling control algorithms and electric circuits;
(5) Specific technical libraries for modeling mechanical force modules; (6) A numerical library for data
representation and reporting; and (7) A model animation tool.</P>

<P>Even though models could be built using a high level computer language, such as C or FORTRAN, in order to
design an effective virtual proving ground for hybridelectric vehicles, computer packages that have been designed
specifically for simulation of general dynamic systems that are currently being used in the engineering community
represent a better choice. MATLAB will be used as the simulation environment for the virtual proving ground. Due
to the complexity of vehicle models and the availability of vehicle models with different degrees of fidelity, DADS is
chosen as the multibody dynamics simulation program. DADS version 8.0 includes the interface necessary to
interact with MATLAB. Within the MATLAB environment, a hybridelectric power system model is constructed
using the SIMULINK graphic simulation language, built in numerical functions, and application specific ' libraries
(toolboxes). If the degree of complexity of the core mechanical vehicle model is anything but simplified, then a
model within the DADS 8.0 environment will be linked to the model in MATLAB. </P>

<P>Parallel technology developments being carried out by the University of Iowa are implementing and validating
selected components of the virtual proving ground. The driving simulation environment created under
complementary DoD and DOT projects using the Iowa Driving Simulator (IDS), and ultimately the National
Advanced Driving simulator (NADS) whose development is proceeding under funding of $47 million from the DOT
and State of Iowa, is enabling this project to focus on unique aspects of hybridelectric vehicles. A modular
structure for simulation of drivetrain and control subsystems that are typical of electric and hybridelectric vehicles
is being designed to be compatible with subsystem models being developed under complementary ARPA and
DOT support. Using this design, high fidelity models of electric and hybridelectric vehicle subsystems developed
by a number of organizations can be integrated into realtime software that is operational on the Iowa Driving
Simulator. This fundamentally new capability will also be implemented in a nonrealtime computer aided
engineering (CAE) environment, for use by DoD, coalition partners, and the PNGV.</P>

<P><B>Project Deliverables:</B></P>

<P>The design of a high fidelity hybridelectric vehicle virtual proving ground will be delivered to
guide work in subsequent application projects for (1) creating highly realistic hybridelectric vehicle models that
can be used for subsystem testing and development in a broadly applicable hybridelectric vehicle virtual proving
ground, (2) integrating vehicle models and data that are based on extensively tested contemporary hybridelectric
powertrain subsystems, (3) supporting test and validation or vehicle electric power subsystem models that are
being developed under the ARPA hybrid-electric combat vehicle program, and (4) providing a unique new capability
for PNGV to carryout tradeoff studies involving vehicle handling and derivability.</P>

<P><B>Project Schedule:</B></P>

<P><UL><LI>Virtual proving ground design will be completed by October, 1996.</UL></P>

<h3>Hawii Electric Vehicle Demonstration Project (HEVDP)</h3><p>

<blockquote>

<B>Project Title:  Data Acquisition Systems, Powertrain Monitors, Controller and Battery Management System<p>

Performing Organization:  Detection Limit Technology (DLT)</B><p>

c/o 531 Cooke Street<br>
Honolulu, Hi 96813<br>
Technical POC: Dr. Christian Schoen<br>
Phone: 3077420555<br>
Fax: 3077420168<br>
EMail: cschoen@spectra.eng.hawaii.edu<p>

<P><B>Project Summary: </B></P>

<P>Detection Limit Technology (DLT) provides data acquisition services for all vehicles
under HEVDP's '93 and '94 programs. These services include: data acquisition systems,
sensors, powertrain monitors, electric vehicle local controller and battery management
systems; and data logger replacements for electric vehicles. 
</P>

<P><B>Data Acquisition Systems (DAS) </B></P>

<P>The DAS consists of an expandable 12 bit analog to digital sensor controller (SC) which
digitizes the analog signals from the sensors. The SC is also equipped with a frequency
counter to accept signals from the speedometer/odometer. The computing and logging
functions are performed by a 386SX based embedded PC (EPC). For driver interaction,
it uses a handheld keyboard with a 32 character, 8 line LCD display. The SC is
connected to the EPC via a RS232 serial port. IDLMS100 is the application software that
controls the system. It logs data, provides useful data for the driver in an easy to read
format, simple single key operation, intelligent switching from drive mode to charge mode
and back, checks for low stateofcharge and alarm levels, and real time data analysis to
keep track of stateofcharge, mileage, and min./max. values of parameters. The system
also has an automatic powerup/powerdown option. This allows the system to be a fully
automatic "turnkey" system. The sensors were designed especially for the noisy
environment of an electric vehicle, utilizing temperature compensated halleffects that
makes the sensors completely isolated from the parameters being measured . The
signals are conditioned and filtered for clean and accurate data. DH sensors measure
DC voltage, DC current, and temperature. WAV sensors measure true RMS AC voltage,
true RMS AC current, true power, and temperature. AT sensors measure altitude, tilt, and
temperature. DB sensors measure accessories' on/off. Payload Sensors for the '94
program are in the design stages. These sensors will incorporate Linear Voltage
Displacement Transducer (LVDT) technology which conveys vehicle payload to the DAS
when hooked to the coil or leaf springs. Input AC power sensors will also be installed
under the '94 program. 
</P>

<P><B>Powertrain Monitors</B></P>

<P>Powertrain Monitors for the '94 program are in the design stages. They will monitor the
true RMS AC voltage, true RMS AC current, and true power between the motor and
controller. The biggest obstacle is accessing the cables of interest. DLT has been
working with Hughes Power Control Systems to resolve this problem. </P>

<P><B>Controller and Battery Management Systems </B></P>

<P>Electric vehicle local controller and battery management systems (BMS) for the '94
program are also in the design stages. The local controller will provide range estimation,
speedometer/odometer, input and output for control, and output ports for data logging.
The BMS will level voltage of batteries, determine stateofcharge, and provide a
programmable platform for fast and regular charging methods. </P>

<B>Project Deliverables:</B>

Data Acquisition Systems 

<P>DLT has designed and built ten complete DAS. Six have been installed in electric
vehicles in the 93 program. Installation of the other four DAS await delivery of vehicles.
Auto powerup/powerdown option has been built and installed in three of ten vehicles in
the '94 program. Sensors have been installed in 27 of the 35 vehicles in the '93 program;
the remaining eight will be installed during component retrofits operations by the vehicle
manufacturer. One of 30 input AC power sensors in the '94 program have been installed.
Five vehicles will be equipped with payload sensors. One of 30 AC infest Dower sensors
has been installed.</P> 

<P><B>Powertrain Monitors</B> </P>

<P>Five vehicles will be equipped with powertrain monitors. </P>

<P><B>Controller and Battery Management Systems</B></P> 

<P>Twenty vehicles will be equipped with the BMS system for the '94 program. </P>

<B>Project Schedule: </B>

<P>Data Acquisition Systems</P> 

<P>Six of ten DAS systems have been installed. Three systems will be installed by March 31,
1996. One awaits delivery of the vehicle by the manufacturer. Six auto
powerup/powerdown options will be installed by March 31, 1996. The remaining one
awaits delivery of the vehicle; tentative date is May 1996. Sensors have been installed in

<P><B>Program Description</B></P>

<P>A small start-up firm, Coriolis Corporation has proof-of-principle demonstrated a potentially low-cost high-voltage circuit breaker that could be used as a battery pack safety switch - with particularly strong applications to high powered vehicles.  The Coriolis technology employs a new, inexpensive method for extinguishing arc which can be adapted to low cost molded case switchgear, such as contactors, relays and circuit breakers.  It provides a low cost alternative to vacuum circuit breakers.  The technology can be adapted to the distribution voltage range, potentially up to 15kv, for Utility and facility use.  It addresses the underdeveloped market for transfer switches for use in UPS, ASD, process control and other critical applications.</P>

<h3>Electricore</h3><p>

<blockquote>
<B>Project Title:  Electric Variable Transmission<p>

Performing Organization:  Allison Transmission Division of GMC,  Delco Propulsion Systems</B><p>


Technical POC: Jim Rancourt, ATD, (317) 2423633<P></P>
<P>
<B>Project Summary:</B> </P>

<P>The EVT is a unique parallel hybrid electric drive system which merges the advantages of electrical
and mechanical power transfer, offering cost and emissions benefits to both commercial and military markets. The EVT
system uses both mechanical (internal combustion engine) and electrical (high voltage battery energy storage) input
power in parallel to deliver optimum performance and fuel economy to the vehicle. An input split gear scheme provides
variation in transmission output speed  and therefore vehicle speed  while maintaining constant engine speed, allowing
the engine to operate on the optimum BSFC curve for any power condition. This unique concept in speed and torque
control is made possible through the use of two highly efficient electrical machines. The electrical machines can
function as either a motor or generator depending on vehicle power requirements and operating conditions. </P>

<P>The engine can be significantly reduced in size based on average vehicle duty cycle power requirements allowing for
higher efficiency, especially in constant speed portions of the duty cycle where most power is transferred mechanically.
Several modes of operation are possible with energy input from either the downsized engine and/or the energy storage
device depending on the specific mode of operation. Both engine and batteries are used for maximum acceleration, the
engine only for cruising at near constant speed, or battery only for emissionfree electric operation. A novel accessory
drive scheme allows the EVT to drive conventional accessories and POT's in either the normal hybrid mode or the
electric only mode without the addition of a separate accessory drive motor. </P>

<P>The EVT technology is scaleable over a wide range of vehicles from automotive through heavy military vehicles. The
synchronous shift gearing can be modified to add or delete transmission operating modes (rings). Additional
transmission modes reduce the requirements placed on the power conditioning electronics and the two
motor/generators, thereby increasing power density and transmission speed/torque without significantly increasing
performance requirements of the electrical components .</P>

<P>This project will demonstrate: (1) concept feasibility of a hybrid power train system for commercial heavy duty cargo
trucks and military and tactical combat vehicles; (2) system performance levels equal to or exceeding that for the
conventional engine/transmission power trains; and (3) a minimum 16 percent improvement in fuel economy over
conventional powertrains. </P>

<P><B>Project Deliverables:</B></P>

<P>Deliverables for the EVT program include procurement, build and lab testing of one EVT system
including the transmission, two motor/generators, two inverters, two 17.5 kWHr battery packs and required control
systems and algorithms. In addition, a "virtual prototyping" vehicle simulation using the EVT power train will be
developed by the University of Iowa for evaluation on the Iowa Driving Simulator. Also, Indiana University, Purdue
University at Indianapolis (IUPUI) will develop an optimizing energy management strategy for both parallel and series
hybrid propulsion schemes.</P>

<P><B>Project Summary:</B></P>

<P>It is known that heat flux and thermal gradients during charging and discharging under various ambient conditions affect battery capacity. Controlled sources of external heating or cooling can create more uniform temperatures within a battery pack, leading to more consistently available capacity.</P> 

<P>A thermal evaluation of the Electrosource Horizon battery will be conducted to identify the parameters which need to be considered when designing a thermal
management system. The project goal is to better characterize and quantify these parameters, through empirical measurements and evaluation, to aid the development of thermal management systems which will optimize performance and battery life at a reasonable cost.</P>

<P><B>Project Deliverables:</B></P>
<P>Battery Calorimeter To quantify thermal design parameters, precise measurements of temperature difference must be made. The first task of the project will: </P>
<UL>
<P>design, build, calibrate and demonstrate a battery calorimeter capable of measuring heat released or absorbed by batteries under charge and discharge conditions at different test temperatures.  </P>
</UL>
<P>Data Collection on Test Batteries  Battery modules will be temperature soaked prior to testing at a reference temperature and at three different test temperatures. Data to include: </P>

<UL>
<LI>internal and external temperatures of the battery;
<LI>heat transfer under charging; 
<LI>heat transfer under fixed current discharging. </UL>

     <P><B>Resistive Heating Evaluation: </B></P>

<P>a heating element will be chosen and positioned under the test battery based on the results of earlier testing. </P>

<P>the battery calorimeter will be utilized to simulate an insulated vehicle battery tray of known heat transfer characteristics. </P>

<P>testing will be performed at two charge rates and two discharge rates to assess heating element impact on temperature uniformity.</P>

<P>Final Recommendations Report  A final report will be generated at the conclusion of this task to describe the tests, discuss the results, and provide recommendations for design of thermal management systems. </P>

<P>A resistive heating design will be implemented in conjunction with the battery pack testing being performed at the Sacramento Consortium Battery Test Facility.</P> 

<P><B>Project Schedule: </B></P><P>This tenmonth project will provide and quantitative thermal
parameters to aid the development of thermal management systems.

<B>Project Title:  San Francisco Bay Area Station Car Program<p>

Performing Organization:  Bay Area Rapid Transit District
	
</B><p>

<P>Technical Contact:  Victoria Nerenberg  (510) 869-2416</P>

<P><B>Program Description</B></P>

<P>The Electric Station Car program creates the nation's first and largest fleet of "station cars," multi-user electric vehicles dedicated for use commuting to or from a transit station, such as a rail stop.  Station cars provide multimodal flexibility to transit, while encouraging ridership and providing a clean door-to-door commute.  Station cars also provide an early market for EVs.  A total of 40 station cars will operate out of several BART stations.</P>

<P>Two-passenger, purpose-built electric cars, designed to be manufactured in the United States starting in 1997, will be used in this project.  The initial delivery of 12 vehicles in 1995 will have a range of approximately 65 miles and a top speed of 55 mph.
</P>
	<P>The balance of 28 purpose-built vehicles will be upgraded for a top speed of 65 mph and a range of 70-90 miles.  These cars are designed around a lightweight aluminum space frame, with a fully recyclable thermoplastic body.  The cars will be powered by an AC drive train and either lead-acid or nickel-cadmium batteries.</P>

<P><B>Milestones</B></P>	

<P>A multiple-vehicle charging kiosk has been installed.  Eight station cars were delivered in October 1995, with four additional cars supplied to the program in January 1996.  The remaining 28 vehicles will be delivered to BART in the late summer of 1996.</P>

<B>Project Title: Flywheel Surge Power Unit<p>
Performing Organization: United Technologies Flywheel Development</B>

<P><B>Project Goals and Technologies</B></P>


               

<P>United Technologies is developing a flywheel surge power unit for automotive hybrid vehicle applications
and has tested three prototype units over the past two years, one under the ARPA / NAVC program.
UTC's efforts have concentrated on a passenger car Flywheel Surge Power Unit (FSPU) having a rated
power of 25 to 50 kW and an energy storage capability of 800 Wh at 35,000 RPI\/I. Flywheel units are
also being designed for electric utility energy storage and power quality applications under separate
funding.</P>

<P>UTC's current FSPU system consists of an outer vacuum containment vessel an inner containment ring,
a rotating composite rotor/hub/back-iron/ assembly, a watercooled motor/generator, and a magnetic
bearing system. The flywheel rotor consists of the composite wheel, the hub, and the cylinder which
contains the backiron of the motor/generator and magnetic bearings. Major factors which determine the
design include energy storage capacity, cost, number of spinup and spindown cycles, and size
constraints. The use of a conical section hub to attach the wheel to the backiron shaft is standard gas
turbine technology. It provides an axisymmetric attachment to the wheel and can be tailored to isolate
the deflection of the flywheel from the deflection of the shaft.. The primary bearing support system
consists of two radial and one axial permanent magnet-based magnetic bearings. This controller contains
the algorithm used to adjust the force and damping properties of the bearings as a function of rotor speed.
The motor/generator is a permanent magnet design having a watercooled stator. </P>

<P>The vacuum/containment vessel is designed for ease of assembly / disassembly of prototype units and is
therefore fairly large compared to a production version. A steel containment ring structure is located
around the rotor for containment of the rotating mass. A light weight containment system is envisioned in
a final design. Tests of 30 cm diameter subscale wheels have resulted in "shredded wheat" type material
after intentional burst Several tests have been performed to fail the 12.3 kg, 40 cm diameter full scale
composite flywheel. Attempts to fail the wheel itself in this configuration at or below maximum operating
speed by intentionally weakening the composite have so far been unsuccessful. Tests which simulated
failure of the bearing system were performed by intentionally dropping the wheel at speed onto the
containment structure The wheel simply rotated until it came to a stop, apparently bouncing off the sides
and wearing off the side surfaces, indicating a robust design.</P>

<P>Intentional failure mode testing of a complete system is planned in the near future. </P>

<B>Project Title: Engineering Improvements for Purpose-built Electric Vehicles<p>
Performing Organization: PIVCO A/S</B><p>

<P>Technical Contact:  Christophe Malaterre  (818) 565-5600</P>

<P><B>Program Description</B></P>

<P>PIVCO has developed a lightweight, efficient and inexpensive two-passenger urban electric vehicle, which is currently in beta prototype testing in Europe and the United States.  This car, which is projected be available for $10,000 in low volumes of production, is currently being upgraded to meet U.S. highway speeds (65 mph), as well as acceleration and driving range capabilities for the U.S. commuter market.
</P>

<P>This program will provide critical engineering design improvements and durability testing for the PIVCO CITI vehicle.  Specifically, this program will consist of additional safety and crashworthiness testing (side impact and rollover requirements); durability testing of the power train; fit and finish design improvements; and additional sourcing support to identify and incorporate more U.S.-made components into the production vehicle.</P>

<P>This program is part of a larger engineering design and compliance program at PIVCO which is leading to development of the final production-ready model of the CITI vehicle.  PIVCO's goal is to begin production of these vehicles in the U.S. in the first 3-6 months of 1997, initially at 10,000 vehicles per year, but increasing quickly thereafter.
</P>

<P><B>Milestones</B></P>

<P>During the first two months of the project, PIVCO will complete most of the safety testing and the durability testing.  By the ninth month of the project, the design improvements will be complete.  Sourcing and final crashworthiness testing will be completed by the end of the 12-month program period.

<B>Project Title:  Homopolar EV Traction Motor Development for Improved Safety and Reduced Cost
<p>
Performing Organization:The University of Texas, Center for Electromechanics</B><p>

<P>POINT OF CONTACT: Joe Beno <BR>
The University of Texas at Austin,<br>
Center for Electromechanics<br>
Telephone: (512) 4714496

<P><B>Program Summary: </B></P> 
<P>
Homopolar motors are an attractive alternative to conventional DC and induction machines for hybrid
and allelectric vehicles both civilian and military Known for their high current capability, this inherent
characteristic allows high power levels to be achieved from a low voltage power supply of 50 volts Fifty
volt EV drivetrains of which several advantages include: </P>

<P><UL>
<LI>     Improved safety (50 volts represents a safety threshold; electrical codes require no special safety provisions for systems below 50 volts);
<LI>     Controllers lend themselves to the use of high efficiency MOSFET switching devices;
<LI>     Hybrid drivetrains are possible with as few as 5 standard EV lead acid batteries (high voltage systems require strings of batteries to produce system voltage); 
<LI>     Long strings of batteries, which tend to experience lifetime problems, can be avoided; and
<LI>     Reduced system cost appear feasible, primarily due to controller simplicity.</UL></P>

<P>Work on this project began in May 1995, and a prototype motor design has been completed, sized at
100 kW for a small transit bus. This design uses a fourpass armature and operates at a peak current
of 5,000 Amps from a 48voit battery pack. </P>

<P>Brush testing is in progress to address efficiency improvements, document wear rates, and confirm
operation of several new lowcost and compact brush actuater designs. Test data obtained so far
shows excellent operation of a constant force springactuated brush and brush holder design.
Brush wear rates at normal driving conditions appear to be far less than those obtained from worst
case speed and current loading conditions cited in previous studies. This is very encouraging
considering the typical duty cycle of the bus. </P>

<P>To regulate power flow to the motor, CEM is investigating a highcurrent pulse width modulator (WPM)
controller based on a highly parallel array of MOSFET switching devices For low voltage systems,
MOSFETs are an ideal choice given their low on state resistance, high switching frequency, low
switching losses, and ease of parallel operation A 300 Amp prototype has been assembled, and
testing is under way to confirm operation with a low impedance load.</P>

<P>In conjunction with the motor design and fabrication effort, UTCEM is addressing system integration
issues, with special emphasis on hybrid drivetrains. </P>

<B>Project Title: Low Cost Sensorless Drive<p>
Performing Organization: Solectria</B>

<P>Project Goals and Technologies</P>

<P><UL>
<LI>Motor drive for low power auxiliary motors in a vehicle to let them operate without a position/speed sensor. {motors used for air conditioning, power brakes, etc..)
<LI>Develop algorithms to estimate rotor parameters (position, time constant) for optimum efficiency operation.
<LI>Enables use of high efficiency & reliability, low cost AC motors instead of brush DC motors. Parts and labor costs reduced becaus there is no sensor required.
<LI>Eventual goal Is to transfer knowledge to controller for the vehicle's main motor, if it can be made to feel sufficiently smooth. </UL></P>


<P><B>Solectria Electronics</B></P>

<P>Solectria has been developing advanced, high efficiency, lightweight electric vehicle
drive systems and components since 1989. These components have been placed in actual
onroad applications for well over 1,000,000 miles in over 200 vehicles built by Solectria. In
addtion, vehicles built by other large and small companies, as well as university teams etc.
have successfully put electric and hybrid electric vehicles on the road almost exclusively
using Solectria components.
</P>

<P>
ARPA's support has allowed Solectria to concentrate on innovative, low cost driven EV
electronics and drive system products to the point where they are ready for
commercialization. These component projects have been selected and executed because
they represent a significant contribution to Me technological and economic feasibility of
electnc and hybrid electric vehicles.

<P><B>Project Summary:</B></P>

<P>The 5phase synchronous reluctance motorsystem is an outgrowth of an ongoing
synchronous reluctance motor system development program. It will have improved performance over the 3phase
synchronous reluctance motor system in all six categories listed below. It is predicted that this machine will have
wide applications for many military and commercial applications under 40,000 pounds GVW.</P>

<P><UL>
<LI>     higher efficiency and high power density (10%20%) 
<LI>     lower rotor losses, permitting simpler cooling system 
<LI>     better utilization of silicon, allowing lower rated devices 
<LI>     simpler to control, can use a cheaper controller than the induction motor 
<LI>     can be operated without sensors, this increases the reliability and reduces cost 
<LI>     provides higher reliability than 3phase induction or synchronous reluctance machines 
</UL></P>
<P>This new design will achieve superior efficiency due to better iron and copper utilization and enhanced magnetic

<B>Project Title: Softswitched/lowloss IGBT AC motor controller<p>
Performing Organization: Solectria</B>

<P><B>Project Goals and Technologies</B></P>



<P>The goal of this project is to design a low cost, love loss IGBTbased motor controller which can run at sufficient power levels while using air cooling, as opposed to liquid cooling. </P>
<P>
We currently have an operational aircooled IGBTbased UNIOC motor controller. To date. it has undergone over 80
hours of dynamometer testing and over 100 miles of road use. On the dynamometer. we
have tested the IGBT UNIOC up to 43 kW under load and up to 65 kVA (210 A at 312V)
with no load. </P>

<P><B>Solectria Electronics</B></P>

<P>Solectria has been developing advanced, high efficiency, lightweight electric vehicle
drive systems and components since 1989. These components have been placed in actual
onroad applications for well over 1,000,000 miles in over 200 vehicles built by Solectria. In
addtion, vehicles built by other large and small companies, as well as university teams etc.
have successfully put electric and hybrid electric vehicles on the road almost exclusively
using Solectria components.
</P>

<P>
ARPA's support has allowed Solectria to concentrate on innovative, low cost driven EV
electronics and drive system products to the point where they are ready for
commercialization. These component projects have been selected and executed because
they represent a significant contribution to Me technological and economic feasibility of
electnc and hybrid electric vehicles.

<B>Project Title: Advanced Hybrid Vehicle Technology
<P>
Performing Organization: Battery Automated Transportation (BAT)</B></P>

3601 Empire Avenue <BR>
Burbank, CA 91505 <BR>
Technical POC: Bill Wason <BR>
Phone: 818-565-5555 <BR>
Fax: 818-565-5559 <BR>
EMail: 

<P><B>Project Summary:</B> </P>

<P>BAT has recently initiated research on an advanced engine concept that will be
incorporated in both superefficient and hybrid electric vehicles. The engine concept
involves a combination of two different technologies detailed below that result in an
ultralean burn, ultrahigh compression that is very clean, has very high fuel efficiency and
increases power output. This is a major breakthrough, since in the past efficiency has
been gained only with a loss of power which has affected marketability. </P>

<P>     Giese Engine Technoloqv involves use of a redesigned head that incorporates
     changes in the air intake and exhaust valve mechanisms. This results in cleaner
     intake air and allows timing processes to be adjusted. 
     Propulsion Technologies is working with BAT to develop an ultrahigh compression,
     ultralean burning combustion technology that will be coupled with Giese Engine
     Technology to achieve high power output, improved fuel efficiency and ULEV
     emission levels. Propulsion Technologies engine modifications involve changes
     that result in an instantaneous method to reform gasoline for use in ultrahigh
     compression ultraburn engines. </P>

<P><B>Project Deliverables:</B> </P>

<P>Both engine concepts will be combined in production engines that are used either in a
standard four door sedan chassis for a super efficient vehicle or installed on a small
engine that is used for an auxiliary power unit (APU) for a hybrid electric vehicle. The
APU will then be installed in a Ford Ranger Pickup Truck that has been modified to run
on electricity using BAT's standard MaxiTorque drive train package and Optima
batteries. The truck is expected to have better acceleration than the standard Ford
Ranger truck, very high fuel efficiency (60 mpg), and very low emissions. </P>

<P><B>Project Schedule: </B>Pending finalization of contract, the hybrid electric Ford Ranger
Pickup Truck should be built and undergoing evaluation by September 1996. </P>

This effort reflects expanded capabilities of the EHV NDC. In
this project we will stuc the Power Management System (PMS) module
and the control used to achieve maximum efficiency under different

we propose the construction of a PMS module and a Control System
(CS) module to be integral with the advanced EHV Simulator that
already exists. Such module construction has two major advantages;
one is the overall improvement of the EHV series configuration;
the other the study of efficiency of an existing controller scheme
under different powertrains, and mission objectives.

<B>Project Title: Reliability and Containment System Testing for Flywheels<p>
Performing Organization: Rocketdyne/Rockwell Corporation</B><p>

<P>Technical Contact:  Terry Lorier  (818) 586-1129</P>

<P><B>Program Description</B></P>

<P>Rocketdyne/Rockwell has developed a low-cost titanium flywheel, with a unique rotor design which allows the flywheel to fail in a very safe mode.  This project will conduct safety and containment testing on this flywheel, to determine the reliability of the containment structure, designed to safely manage the dissipation of the flywheel's kinetic energy during failure.</P>

<P>The Rocketdyne flywheel design incorporates some unique safety features into a 1.0 kWh unit.  The principal advantage is that the rotational inertia of the flywheel is fractured in a very predictable manner, with minimal energy release.  The Rocketdyne design allows only the rim mass energy to be released upon failure, with this energy absorbed by the containment ring structure made of ultra-strong steel alloys which minimizes the cost of the flywheel system.</P>

<P>In this program, Rocketdyne will build a scaled containment ring and housing, will install it on the flywheel unit, and will conduct fully-instrumented destruction testing to verify the predicted failure mode and containment.  The flywheel rotor and system will then be rebuilt to its original configuration at the end of this test project.</P>

<P><B>Milestone</B>s</P>

<P>This program is just beginning, and will last for twelve months.  The flywheel containment ring will be designed and fabricated by the sixth month of the project, with full speed testing beginning in month 9.</P>

<B>Project Title:  IUPUI Race Car & NiMH Battery  Data Collection<p>

Performing Organization:  Indiana University  Purdue University at Indianapolis</B><p>

<P>Technical POC: Gary Burkart, (317) 2781665</P>

<P><B>Project Summary:</B></P>

<P>The high current application required in racing will provide an excellent method of testing the
batteries and benchmarking NiMH performance versus PbA batteries. Under high current conditions, it is
anticipated that the NiMH batteries will significantly out perform the PbA. A major chassis and battery pack
engineering challenge will be to define a satisfactory thermal management system that is able to keep the
batteries within specified operating temperature. </P>

<P>The objective of the project is to compare the performance of the NiMH battery versus the current PbA battery
used in the race car. The race car will be instrumented and a data acquisition system will monitor race car and
battery pack performance. Data will be uploaded to the Electric/Hybrid Vehicle National Data Center established
by ARPA at the University of Hawaii.</P>

<P>The following advantages are anticipated when PbA batteries are replaced with NiMH batteries: </P>

<UL>
<LI> 10% less battery weight per battery pack, 
<LI> 8% increase in dc voltage per battery pack, 
<LI> equivalent battery pack power, and 
<LI> 100% increase in battery pack energy availability. </UL>

<P>The EV race car will likely experience more that twice the range with NiMH batteries versus PbA batteries. This
provides a substantial advantage and a winning race strategy. </P>

<P>Production processes for the NiMH battery are currently being developed by GM Ovonic. The battery may be
offered for electric/hybrid vehicles and other applications during 1997/98. Currently, prototype batteries are
available for evaluation in appropriate applications. GM Ovonic is particularly interested in high current demand
applications. The race car represents such an application.</P>

<P><B>Project deliverables: </B></P><P>DAS Results and Final Report of Findings</P> 
<P><B>Project Schedule:</B> </P><P><UL>
<LI>Expected to begin May 1, 1996 & continue for 2 yrs.</UL>

<B>Project Title:  Rotary Engine for Hybrid Transit Bus<p>

Performing Organization:  APS Systems, Inc.</B><p>

<P>Technical Contact:	Ed Atelian  (805) 984-0300</P>

<P><B>Program Description</B></P>

<P>APS Systems is developing a purpose-built full-size transit bus, for demonstration by two major California transit districts.  This bus will incorporate advanced composite materials in its frame and body, to reduce the vehicle's weight and its energy requirements.  The drive train for the bus consists of two Rexroth Indramat 100 kW AC motors, powered by Saft nickel-cadmium batteries.  This bus will incorporate many of the novel design features of APS' recently-delivered 35-foot electric transit bus, now in service with the Santa Barbara Metropolitan Transit District.</P>

<P>A unique feature of this bus is that it incorporates a new auxiliary power unit from Alturdyne, Inc.  This 40 kW generator set, to be used for range extension on the electric transit bus, uses a high-efficiency, low-emission, multi-fuel rotary engine under development by Alturdyne.  The APU is a two-rotor engine, coupled to an electric generator capable of producing a nominal voltage of 300 V.</P>

<P><B>Milestones</B></P>

<P>This program will produce and put integrate hybrid electric bus, incorporating a rotary engine auxiliary power unit.  Detailed operational and performance data will also be collected and summarized through the CALSTART data acquisition effort.  The bus will be placed into service in July, 1996, for an 18 month demonstration period.</P>

<B>Project Title: SmartCoolTM Air Conditioning System  S10 Electric Pickup<p>

Performing Organization: Smart Power Systems</B><p>


<P>Technical POC: Gregg Peterson, (810) 6820203</P>

<P><B>Project Summary:</B></P>

<P>The project objective is to develop a highefficiency, lightweight air conditioning system for
electric passenger vehicles. The system is based on a new twostage centrifugal compressor with an integral DC
brushless permanent magnet motor designed by Smart Power Systems. The system uses a low pressure
environmentally friendly refrigerant; system pressures are typically 15 psi to 30 psi. The nominal design output is
18,000 BTU/hr; the maximum design capacity is 21,000 BTU/hr. The theoretical compressor input power at 18,000
BTU/hr capacity is less than 1,400 watts at the ASHRAE highefficiency rating point. Input power is substantially
reduced as a function of ambient conditions. As an example, modeling the system at the ASHRAE SEER rating
point yields an output of over 8,000 BTU/hr using less than 400 watts of compressor input power.</P>

<P>The SmartCool centrifugal compressor weights under 10 pounds and is 30% smaller than similar capacity electric
R134a compressors. </P>

<P>A microprocessor continuously monitors and controls all system parameters with millisecond response times and
ensures that the compressor is operating at its highest efficiency at all times. Computercontrolled functions
include compressor motor speed, condenser fan speed, and expansion valve setting. The compressor will be
mounted in the vehicle motor compartment; the refrigerant lines will be routed through the front of dash. The
existing HVAC module will be updated with a SmartCool compatible evaporator and condenser. The evaporator
blower and condenser fan will be production Chevrolet units. The system will utilize production HVAC controls and
related hardware wherever possible. </P>

<P><B>Project Deliverables: </B></P><P>A 240 VDC SmartCool compressor, related electronics, and heat exchangers will be
installed on a Solectria E10 pickup and evaluated starting this September. The objective is to improve the vehicle
range.
</P>
<P><B>Project Schedule: </B></P><P>QTR3 1996 installation target  performance evaluations and engineering enhancements to
continue through the end of the contract.

<b>Project Summary:</B>
<P>
Rapid Charging of batteries extends the travel distance of electric
vehicles (EVs) well beyond the range allowed by onboard or overnight
charging systems currently available. This type of infrastructure
will play a significant role in making EVs convenient to operate
and a positive experience for users, thereby contributing to the
proliferation of EVs operating on roadways throughout the country.
This in turn, reduces harmful NMOG tailpipe emissions and improves
air quality in the region.
<P>
This project's goal is to produce a universal rapid charger that
will charge electric vehicles meeting the evolving industry guidelines
for level 3 conductive charging. At issue is the need to provide
a charging unit capable of charging multiple types of vehicles
and batteries in a way that is safe, efficient, and effective.
This project takes into account the operator interface, vehicle
interface, battery requirements, and the interface to the utility
grid with emphasis on power quality. The Advanced Rapid Charger
will be capable of providing charging current and voltage for
multiple charging regimes using constant current and/or constant
voltage, pulse charging and pulse charging/pulse discharge types
of algorithms.

charging system in an electric vehicle To do so, we will evaluate the performance of the algorithm
relative to inductive charging, validate its compatibility with inductive chargers, and study its effects on
the battery pack in an electric vehicle. The pulse charging strategy is expected to enhance the
performance and cycle life of the pack. </P>

<P>EPTI suggests that the algorithm is more efficient whether overnight or fast charging and can lead to
improved battery pack cycle life and performance. DELCO Power Control Systems has a highly
efficient inductive charger (MagneChargeTM) and is interested in advancing the device's capability to
be compatible with pulse charging algorithms such as the EPTI charging strategy Such charge
strategies have not been integrated with inductive charging systems before. Virginia Power, as a utility
that is active in research for EV infrastructure, has a capability to perform invehicle testing of EV
battery packs provided by GNB, Gates, and possibly others. This project Will be coordinated with a
project seeking to evaluate the pulse charging algorithm itself.</P>

<P>The team will jointly develop and test the capability to combine two efficient technologies to
demonstrate that their combined efficiency is higher that other existing techniques. The payoff of a
successful development will ultimately be lower "fueling costs" for consumers through more efficient
battery charging and extended battery life. The continued advancement of a highly efficient battery
charging infrastructure is essential to the EV transportation industry; therefore, successful
development of this combination of products will have a pervasive impact on EV use in both civilian and
military applications. This technical team recognizes the potential commercialization benefits to both
the sales potential of each company as well as to EV consumers world wide.</P>

<P>Efficient rapid charging of batteries is essential to hybrid operation of military vehicles where space
limitations constrain energy storage and power demands are high. The technology developed in this
project can be configured for use as rapid, high power charging by auxiliary power units in such
military hybrid vehicles. Likewise, it can be useful for high power, rapidcharging offboard chargers as
well for other types of military vehicles Successful advancement of this technology will benefit future
dualuse applications. </P>

<P><B>Benefit:</B></P><P>A highly efficient battery charging system that is inherently safe, maximizes and improves the
overall efficiency of the charging process, and enhances battery pack life and performance. </P>

<B>Project Title: Hybrid Electric Vehicle with Rotapower APU<p>
Performing Organization: Moller International</B><p>

<P>Technical Contact:  Paul Moller  (916) 756-5086
</P>

<P><B>Program Description</B></P>

<P>In this project, Moller International will develop a very low-emission rotary engine, and will integrate it into a hybrid electric vehicle.  This vehicle will then be tested under laboratory and field conditions, to determine if the target goals of more than 70 mpg and equivalent zero-emission vehicle emissions are met.</P>

	<P>Moller International has developed a very powerful and small rotary engine, which produces 15 hp on a continuous basis and a maximum of 30 hp, and which is less than one cubic foot in size -- minus the exhaust system.  This engine will be integrated into an electric Geo Metro (the Solectria Force), and the existing battery pack will be replaced with a high-rate hybrid battery system, designed to provide peak power requirements.  This design allows the battery pack to be reduced by 500 lbs., lowering the vehicle weight from 2390 lbs. to approximately 1900 lbs. (similar to the original Geo Metro).  These modifications will allow performance to significantly improve, giving acceleration rates of 0-60 mph in 12 seconds and a range of over 250 miles.</P>

	<P>The project will provide a comparison between the performance characteristics of three different vehicles, all built on the same platform, but using different energy sources.
</P>
<P><B>Milestones</B></P>

<P>This program is just beginning, and will last for twelve months.  The APU will be designed and fabricated by the sixth month of the project, and will be fully integrated into the hybrid vehicle by month nine.  Three months of laboratory and road testing will then complete the project.</P>

Performing Organization:  Allison Transmission Division of GMC,  Delco Propulsion Systems</B><p>

<P>Technical POC: Ahmed ElAntably, DelphiE, (317) 5793696</P>

<P><B>Project Summary: </B></P>

<P>A 3phase synchronous reluctance motorsystem represents a new motor design which will use a novel manufacturing process to mass produce these motors at a lower cost and weight than a similar induction motor. A complementary part of the program is to develop and bring on line a process for manufacturing a composite powder/polymer metal for rotors and stators which will optimize their mechanical properties and enhance manufacturability. Development of a new control strategy will optimize total system efficiency, simplify operation, allow better packaging due to reduced cooling requirements, and minimize the
drive controller complexity and cost. These motors are suitable for electric/hybrid electric (EV/HEV) cars, buses,
and drives for military applications. Testing of a semioptimized synchronous reluctance motor and controller have
shown promising results and finite element analysis will be used to optimize the system.</P>

<h3>Electricore</h3><p>

<blockquote>
<B>Project Title: Design and Fabrication of SiC Rectifiers<p>

Performing Organization: Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey </B><p>

<P>Technical POC: Professor Jian Zhao, (908) 4455240</P>

<P><B>Project Summary:</B></P><P>While SiC rectifiers with over 1,000 V capability have been reported they are all based on
vertical structures which make them severely limited in achieving high total current capabilities. At present and in
the near future, these rectifiers may not be practical applications because of the presence of the vertical,
"deviceshorting" micropipes in SiC. The demonstrated high voltage rectifiers were typically reported with currents
in the milliampere range because a larger current rectifier would require a larger diode area which inevitably will
include some micropipes, resulting in, not only, a substantially reduced switch voltage, but also unacceptable
uniformity and catastrophic damages. Besides the lack of good control in both epilayer thickness and doping
concentration in the mid 1015 cm3 range and the maximum 101lm epilayers commercially available make it
impossible, at present time, to fabricate the conventional vertical power rectifiers near 1,000 V with a high current
capability and acceptable uniformity. </P>

<P>In this project, we propose to develop planar SiC pn rectifiers using our recent invention in p+ and n+ SiC formation
by ion implantation. In this twoyear project, our goal is to demonstrate the feasibility of the planar rectifiers and to
develop a fabrication technology suitable for commercial production of SiC power rectifiers with a few tens of
amperes total current and up to 2,400 V capabilities needed for electric vehicles and many other applications.</P>

<P>Contrary to the many ongoing aggressive efforts on developing SiC or Si based IGBTs and MCTs, little effort has
been made to dramatically improve, in comparison to the currently used Si pIn diodes, the performance and
reliability of power rectifiers which are needed for each and every kind of power electronic system. This project
aims at a breakthrough by a factor of 10 to 100 in power semiconductor rectifier performance urgently needed, not
just for immediate use, together with Sibased IGBTs and MCTs, for electric vehicles, but also for the merging high
temperature SiC technologies for future advanced electric vehicles. </P>

<P>At the end of this twoyear project, 600 V planar rectifiers with up to a 3A total current will be developed for 300C
operation. Preliminary 1,000 V rectifiers, with up to lA total current, will also be developed.</P>

<P>The most important contribution of this project, if successful, is the demonstration of the feasibility and the
development of the planar SiC rectifier technology which will have widespread applications in almost every kind of
power electronic system. </P>

<P><B>Project deliverables:</B></P> <P>Planar SiC power rectifier of 600 to 1,000 V
</P>
<P><B>Project Schedule:</B></P> <P>Expected to begin May 1, 1996 & continue for 2 yrs.

<P><B>Program Description</B></P>

	<P>CALSTART designed and developed its first generation DAS in 1993 and installed it on a number of heavy electric vehicles.  These systems were designed to use a computer to collect and synthesize data recovered from distributed monitoring points.  While quite robust and capable of handling significant volumes of data, the first generation DAS was larger and more costly than acceptable for the general EV/HEV market.</P>

<P>The CALSTART Data Acquisition System (CDAS) is currently being redesigned as a low cost, on-board data acquisition for EVs and HEVs.  This second generation system will allow users to evaluate the performance of their EVs and HEVs by monitoring all of the various systems, subsystems and components on the vehicle.  CALSTART's first generation system allows the capability to monitor up to 64 differential signals and 64 single-ended signals.  CALSTART is now working on a new version of this system which will be able to monitor the above signals as well as up to 256 individual batteries.  During charging, the CDAS will also allow for limited battery equalization.  CALSTART's second generation DAS will be based on a PC Card hard drive for data storage, which has a much smaller profile than the current hard drive being used.  As a result, power consumption for the new design has been significantly reduced and operator inputs have been virtually eliminated.  CALSTART also has plans to incorporate the use of a radio-frequency (RF) unit for the battery monitoring system.</P>
	
<P><B>Milestones</B></P>

<P>A prototype is expected in May of 1996, with installation in a variety of EVs and HEVs in 1996.  Full commercialization is planned by late 1996.</P>

<B>Project Title:  Multifuel Reformer/ Fuel Cell Hybrid Bus <p>
Performing Organization:  H Power Systems Corporation</B><p>




<P>Technical POC: Richard Johnson (916) 864-4980 </P>

<P><B>Project Summary: </B></P><P>This program will develop a compact multi-fuel fuel processor
and combine it with a PEM fuel cell stack scaled up from the precursor light duty fuel
cell vehicle project also headed by H Power. This scaled up system will be
demonstrated on JP8 (high grade jet fuel), or other medium distillate hydrocarbon
fuel, in a hybrid electric bus taking advantage of H Power's experience from our
DOE sponsored methanol powered fuel cell hybrid buses. </P>

<P>This type of bus propulsion offers the following key advantages: </P>

<UL>
<LI>     Greatly reduced emissions compared with conventional diesel engines. 
<LI>     Lower fuel costs through higher energy efficiency. 
<LI>     Lower projected operating and maintenance costs. 
<LI>     Use of logistical fuels for military and widespread commercial applications.
<LI>     Competitive projected system power density and cost. </UL>

<P><B>Project Deliverables:</B></P>

<P>This project will result in the development of a 50 to 70 kilowatt PEM fuel cell system
that operates on JP8 fuel, integrated into a hybrid electric bus for test,
demonstration, and further development. </P>

<P><B>Project Schedule:</B></P>

<P>Fuel processor development and testing will be complete in Spring of 1997. Design
and testing of the fuel cell power system will be complete in Fall of 1997, leading to
full integration into the demonstration bus by early 1998. </P>

<P>A reforming fuel processor will be used that can run on logistic fuels, including
gasoline, diesel and JP8. The fuel processor will provide for sulfur removal and CO
reduction to a level compatible with PEM fuel cell operation. A closed loop water
recovery system will collect fuel cell product water for the fuel processor.</P>

<P>This project deals with the PNGV recognized challenges of:</P> 

<P><UL>
<LI>     thinner and lighter weight separator plates of metal and other base materials; 
<LI>     polymer membrane optimization; and 
<LI>     mass production platelet fabrication methods with the potential for very low cost separator plate designs. </UL></P>

<P>Our performance objectives include matching the power density of internal
combustion diesel propulsion systems in 2001.</P>

<h3>Northeast Alternative Vehicle Consortium</h3><p>

<B>Project Title: High Voltage Variable Speed AC to AC Motor Drive (traction drive inverter demonstration)<p>
Performing Organization: D.C. Transformation
</B>


<P><B>Program Description</B></P>

<P>D.C. Transformation, Inc. (DCT) has an innovative inverter topology that can be readily adapted to meet the power conditioning
requirements of a traction drive vehicle. A high power inverter that can accept variable frequency AC input voltage and produce a
variable frequency AC output at high efficiency can be achieved using DCT's Power Conditioning System (PCs). Preliminary
discussions with motor generator manufacturers have pointed out that a matched motor generator pair operators at an optimum
voltage of approximately 3kV can achieve an efficiency in excess of 98.5%. The PCS technology is well suited for operation at or
above the 3kV point with power levels ruing into the megawatts.</P>

<P>A prototype system is being built in a laboratory environment for proof of principle purposes and for validation of the analytical
model. In the current configuration, facility power of 580 VAC will now through a 300kva three phase fullwave bridge rectifier to
be converted to 4OOVDC. The 144kW inverter will transform the 400 VDC to 440 VAC. The output voltage will be adjustable
from a minimum of 17S VAC to a maximum of 440vAC. The output frequency will be variable from DC to 80Hz. The conversion
rate, which directly affects the output voltage, will vary from approximately 200Hz to 2880Hz. The inverter is comprised of three
homogeneous two-stage modules. Each rnodule has two complimentary stages operating 180 degrees out of phase at a
frequency of 1440 Hz. The output waveform is therefore reconstructed at a frequency of 2880 Hz. The higher Inversion rate
significantly reduces the filter requirements and improves the output power quality.</P>

<P>The inversion process is composed of three cycles, sequentialresonant charging, inverse and discharge. Each cycle is currently
configured to occur in series. The charging cycle draws energy from the source and resonantly charges a set of capacitors. The
inversion cycle complements the purity d a one or two of the charging capacitors, depending on the AC output phase angle. The
discharge cycle then delivers the energy to the load through a output LC filter. For this demonstration a unity power factor load
will be used.</P>

<P>This innovative circuit uses a moderate frequency softswitching technique which continuous y draws power form the AC source.
The smooth and continuous flowv of current ensures this inverter will meet the IEEE519 standard regarding the production of
harmonics on the AC input line. The output voltage is conditioned with a 200Hz low pass filter which provides an AC Waveform
with a very low ripple content.</P>

<P>The OCT inverter topology is significantly less noisy than an equivalent IGBT based system. The electrically quiet nature of this
circuit leads to greater efficiency. The advantage comes from the provident use of thyristors. These devices are used in
configuration that incorporates self commutation. Meaning they are typically turned off under zero current conditions, thereby
eliminating the need for lossy snubber circuits.
</P>
<P>Integral to the 144kW inverter is the digital control system. The hybrid system combines the computational capability of a
microprocessor With the speed and dependable of programmable logic. A digital Canal processor (DSP) handles data flow contra
by interfacing to a variety IIO modules. A microcontroller generates adaptive pulse trains Rich are fed to an erasable
programmable logic device (EPLD). This device supplies triggering signals to the solid state switches.</P>

<P>The PCS device is instrumented with a variety of sensors to ensure failsafe operation and internal fault detection. Sensors are
placed at cortical locations to monitor the operating voltage and current. The controller samples these signals to determine the
health and status of the device under test. This system can be regulated The output power is calculated on a pulse to pulse basis
and compared to a desired setpoint. The pulse repetition rate, consequently the power throughput, is adjusted to bring the system
into specification. </P>

Consortium EV development efforts, and </P>

<P><LI> To share performance data and measurement developments with other ARPA
Consortia and the EV community.</P>
</ol>

The SETC EV/ Hybrid Data Collection Project consists of several subprojects:

<P><B>Monthly EV Energy Use Logging: </B></P><P>All SMUD EVs are presently being equipped with
AC kwhr meters. Upgrades to be made in l 9961997 will include addition of hour meters
and development/ installation of totalizing DC kwhr meters on selected vehicles. These
systems are manually read once a month, and recorded values are entered into SMUD's
vehicle database.</P>
<P>
<B>Sensor Harness Development:</B> </P><P>A standardized set of sensors is under development
that will allow use with a variety of data recording systems, including both the Manual and
Automatic ARPA systems described below. REV E installations include current probes
for battery pack and aux. system, battery pack and aux. power voltage, 6 temperature
probes, 2 accelerometers, tiltmeter, and odometer/speedometer. Future revisions will
include motor power measurements, altitude/pressure, vehicle heading or location from
GPS system, hybrid current, and multiple accessory on/off status.</P>

<P><B>Manually Operated ARPA TimeSeries Data Acquisition Systems: </B></P>

<P>These data systems are manually operated by EV program personnel during periodic vehicle testing,
standardized test trips, and routine trips. Systems setups are flexible,
laptopcomputerbased, and can display a variety of realtime parameters for vehicle
operators. Data recording is done on laptop PC drives, and is archived and analyzed
later to provide feedback on vehicle performance to SETC programs for battery, drive
system, hybrid power source, or vehicle development. Data is also converted to ARPA
Electric Vehicle National Data Center (EVNDC) format and downloaded to the EVNDC
data base at the University of Hawaii for further analysis and data sharing amongst
consortia.</P>

<P><B>Automatic Recording ARPA TimeSeries Data Acquisition Systems: </B>
</P>
<P>These systems will provide much of the same TimeSeries data as Manual systems for the same purposes, but will allow data collection in vehicles issued to routine users. Systems will run automatically with no effort on the part of the vehicle operator, and data will be stored in largecapacity drives, transmitted over radio link, or communicated through the
charging station connection. </P>

<P><B>Project Schedule:</B></P>

<P>The overall EV data collection effort will continue throughout the deployment of EVs in
Sacramento. Near term milestones include:</P> 
<P><UL>
<LI>Monthly EV Logging Instrument Upgrades 6/96 6/97
<LI>Manual ARPA TimeSeries DAS Improvements 2/96 6/97
<LI>Additional Manual ARPA TimeSeries DAS Deployment 5/95 3/98

<P>Technical Contact:  Chris Lawler  (310) 517-6915 (phone)  (310) 517-6721 (fax)</P>

<P><B>Program Description</B></P>

<P>Heavy duty electric vehicles, such as buses, contain multiple strings of Description 	parallel battery packs that charge at different rates due to inherent imbalances between the individual battery modules.  High power charging is also becoming a prevalent need by heavy-duty electric vehicle which compounds the charging problem.  To address the problem associated with charging multiple battery packs comprised of batteries of varying capacity and temperature, Delco Electronics Power Control Systems (DEPCS) will develop, test, and demonstrate an effective multi-pack, energy management system.  To properly compensate for all the variation within a pack and between multiple packs requires a system that monitors individual battery module temperature and voltage, and compensates for the capacity variations through charging equalization.  The proposed DEPCS Distributed Energy management System (DEMS) will incorporate individual battery voltage and temperature monitoring and equalization capability using a system of interconnected distributive modules.  The distributive modules are managed through a battery pack controller, which provides total system  control.  Westinghouse, Bluebird, and GNB will all be active participants in this program with DEPCS.</P>


<P><B>Milestones</B></P>	

<P>Delco Electronics Power Control Systems will develop, fabricate, and field test a prototype DEMS hardware over a 12 month period.</P>

Phone: 2058952370
<BR>


<P><B>Program Summary: </B></P> 

<P>The Hybrid Electric HMMWXI Program objective is the development of an advanced high performance
hybrid electric power train for use in a modified High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV)
tactical and support vehicle for the U.S. Army. This vehicle is being designed to outperform the
conventional diesel powered stock vehicle in many areas including acceleration, top speed,
gradeability, and fuel economy while adding capabilities for stealth operations mobile electrical power
delivery and robotic operations.</p>

 <P>Through the use of an advanced, low emission, diesel motor driving a
permanent magnet generator operating in tandem with an advanced high energy density lead acid
battery, this vehicle will achieve acceleration from 0 to 60 mph in 11 seconds typically, a maximum
speed of 80 mph, and a gradeability of 60%with a payload of up to 3400 pounds. Fully independent
four wheel drive using no mechanical differentials will afford increased traction control and mobility from
that of the standard vehicle. No compromises will be made to the interior of the vehicle so that
passenger space and comfort will be the same. Nor will the payload area be changed in any way so
that standard HMMWV payload packages can still be accommodated. </P>

<h3>Northeast Alternative Vehicle Consortium</h3><p>

<blockquote>

<B>Project Title: The Northeast Advanced Thermal Management Technology Project<p>
Performing Organization: Evermont
</B>


<P><B>Program Description</B></P>

<P>The Vermont Electric Vehicle Demonstration Project received a grant from the Advanced
Research Projects Agency (ARPA) and the Northeast Alternative Vehicle Consortium
(NAVC) Or the Northeast A>Jvane:cd Thermal Management Technology Project
(NATMTP). NA1~MTP identifies, develops and tests electric vehicle technologies with the
goal of optimizing battery box thermal management, cabin comfort ant vehicle range in
temperatures down to 20 degree F.</P>

<P><B>Project Activities</B></P>

<P>Data is collected on five 1995 Solectria Force sedans. Four of these vehicles have been
outfitted with electronic data acquisition systems to provide information on vehicle and
battery temperature and performance Data is also collected through manual driver logs;
test course nuns; static heat tests and special studies using temporary data loggers. This
data has been collected, analyzed and displayed in graphs depicting relationships
between temperature and performance.</P>

<P>The Northeast Advanced Thermal Management Technology Project tests and evaluates
the performance of a number of fuel fired heater designs. Fuel fired heaters provide an
efficient use of fossil fuels and eliminate an additional drain on the batteries from having to
heat the vehicle cabins. The Vermont Electric Vehicle demonstration Project invested in
four different fuelfired heaters to discover the one with optimum performance. An electric
heatpump was also designed and demonstrated.</P>

<P>The Vermont Electric Vehicle Demonstration Project worked with the U+S. Array Corps of
Engineers Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory (CRREL) to develop a
cabin thermal model and a battery enclosure model. Results from these tests indicate that
battery thermal management systems appear to substantially overcome adverse effects of
cold weather on leadacid batteries although opportunities exist for optimization through
refinements and energy efficiency improvements.</P>

<P>CRREL also conducted controlled tests on EVermont's electric vehicles to identify friction
and thermal losses. These studies indicate that increased frictional resistance to vehicle
motion accounts for a major reduction in vehicle operating range during winter months.
Some of the increase in friction can be abated by lowviscosity lubricants. Low rolling
resistance tires can also increase range in all weather conditions although they may not
provide adequate traction for winter environments.</P>

<P>The Northcast Advanced Thermal Management Technology Project is also investigating
how heat conservation might be used to heat d vehicle and how to decrease heat loss
through thermal pane installation. targeted cabin heating is being addressed through
heated seats and heated steering wheels.</P>

<h3>Sacramento Electric Transportation Consortium (SETC)</h3><p>

<blockquote>
<B>Project Title:  Fuel Cell Hybrid Electric Vehicle Project<p>
Performing Organization:  H Power Systems Corporation</B><p>


<P>Technical POC: Richard Johnson (916) 8644980</P>

<P><B>Project Summary:</B></P><P>A compact, low cost, massproducible design for proton
exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells is the focus of this project This advancement
is made possible through technology for thin metal fuel cell separators with
Integrated Fluid Management Technology (IFMT), the fluid equivalent of the
integrated circuit.</P>

<P>These separators combine the functions of thermal management, water
management, manifolding, and reactant distribution into a single leakfree structure
0.1 inch thick, resulting in stack power densities three times higher than conventional
graphite designs for a given MEA current density.</P>

<P>H Power has developed high-performance, repeatable MEAs optimized for ambient
pressure air operation using DuPont Nafion 115 and 105 membranes for
maximum fuel cell system efficiency. H Power's MEAs feature very low catalyst
loadings and are fabricated using technologies that are easily scaleable to low cost
mass production. </P>

<P>H Power is working with Hydrogen Burner Technology, Inc. (HBTI) to optimize HBTI's
patented underoxidized burner (UOB). The resulting reformer and associated fuel
processor components convert conventional hydrocarbon fuels such as gasoline,
diesel, and natural gas into hydrogen and CO-with only trace amounts of pollutants
(at least a factor of 10 reduction over combustion power sources). The use of a
logistically available liquid fuel such as diesel or gasoline allows widespread use of
fuel cell powered vehicles without the tremendous cost of a new fuel production,
storage and distribution infrastructure.</P>

<P>This project is a step toward medium and heavy duty hybrid electric vehicle systems which will be cost competitive with comparable diesel engine systems before 1999,
and offer equivalent power density shortly thereafter.</P>

<P><B>Project Deliverables: </B></P>

<P>This project will result in the development of a 10 kilowatt fuel cell system which will be integrated into a light duty composite chassis pickup truck for demonstrations. It will also result in the bench test of a compact reformer that can operate on either natural gas or liquid hydrocarbon fuels.</P>

<P><B>Project Schedule: </B></P>

<P>Fuel cell stack and reformer testing will be complete in mid1996. The fuel cell
system will then be integrated into the test and demonstration vehicle by mid1997.</P>

<h3>Electricore</h3><p>

<blockquote>
<B>Project Title:  Consumer Demographics<p>

Performing Organization: PSI Energy, Indianapolis Power & Light</B><p>


<P>Technical POC: Madelyn Harwood, PSI Energy, (317) 8381518<br>
Jim Wittman, IPL, (317) 2618214</P> 

<P><B>Project Summary:</B></P><P>Project objective is to determine baseline attitudes and perceptions of 
electric vehicles. Electricore commissioned a survey of people living in the Indianapolis Power and Light, Public
Service Indiana, Southern Indiana Gas and Electric, Northern Indiana Public Service Company, and
IndianaMichigan Power service areas, Chattanooga, Tennessee, and Cincinnati, Ohio. </P>

<P>The results of the study of consumer attitudes showed that over half of those surveyed considered themselves
familiar with electric cars, and almost half said they would consider purchasing an electric vehicle. The study,
which consisted of telephone surveys and the interviewing of focus groups, was concluded in November 1994. </P>

<P>When asked how likely they were to consider purchasing an electric vehicle, 10 percent of those surveyed stated
they would be very likely to do so, while another 36 percent said they would be somewhat likely. Very unlikely was
the choice of 29 percent of the respondents. "Among those whose attitude was unlikely, the reasons centered
upon their development and familiarity," the report continued. "A total of 31 percent of the unlikely segment stated
they will wait until the technology is perfected with an additional 14 percent stating they simply were not familiar
enough with the cars at this time." Respondents cited the perceived range and speed of electric cars as a
negative, according to the report, adding that those with a negative attitude toward an electric car purchase were
"style or performance consumers." Other barriers in the consideration of an electric car were income and single
car households. </P>
<P>
Among the report's findings: </P>
<ul>
<P><li>23 percent of respondents in IPL's service area, and 25 percent in PSI's service area, were either aware of
     EV usage in their area or had seen or used an EV. Fiftyfour percent of those surveyed in Chattanooga
     made the same claim. (Chattanooga is using electric busses as part of its public transportation system.) 
     The survey showed that the group most interested in an electric vehicle were better educated males with
     middleincome white collar jobs. </P>
<P><li>Likelihood of purchasing an EV or interest in an EV varies directly with familiarity, 
     according to the report, pointing out that more than twice as many of those who are very familiar with
     electric cars are very likely to consider them. This would seem to suggest that building familiarity and
     interest go hand in hand. </P>
<P><li>The report recommended that electric cars should be positioned as an alternative vehicle and not as a direct
     competitor to internal combustion vehicles. It also concluded that advertising and demonstrations of electric
     vehicles should be used to increase the public's familiarity with EVs.</P>
</ul>

<P><B>Project Deliverables:</B></P>

<P>Electric Vehicle Attitudes Research Report Study</P>

<P><B>Project Schedule:</B></P>

<P>Although a follow up study is scheduled for this fall, the requirements of this project and
original objectives have been met. Project completed.</P>

<B>Project Title:  SiC MOSgated Thyristor<p>

Performing Organization: Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey </B><p>

 

<P>Technical POC: Professor Jian Zhao, (908) 4455240</P>

<P><B>Project Summary:</B></P> 

<P>The objective of this project is to design and fabricate a SiC MOS gated thyristor (MGT) which
will find immediate applications in electric vehicles. This MGT will not suffer from the stumbling blocks and
devastating problems against the development of SiCbased power devices including the Ushaped grooved
MOSFETs (UMOS), the Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor (IGBTs) and the MOSControlled Thyristors (MCTs).
Concentration will be focused on (i) growth and characterization of SiO2 on SiC UShaped walls etched by the
advanced low damage and residual free high density plasma technique, (ii) ion implantation to form ptype SiC, and
(iii) ohmic contracts to the etched and implanted ptype 6HSiC. These three issues represent the critical barriers
for achieving 600V power MGTs with 1000 A/cm2 and 300 C capability for electric vehicle applications.</P>

<P>At the end of the first year, 400V thyristors capable of 600 A/cm2 at 300C without MOSgate will be developed.
Three power MGTs capable of 600V, 1000A/cm2 and 300 operation will be delivered for independent evaluation at
the end of the second year.</P>

<P><B>Project deliverables:</B></P>

<P>600V SiC MOSgated thyristors capable of 1000A/cm2 at 3.5V for 300 operation</P>

<P><B>Project Schedule:</B></P>

<P>06 Months: 100V MOSFET Demonstrated; 612 Months: 400V Thyristor Fabricated; 1218
Months: 400V MOSgated Thyristor Demonstrated; 1824 Months: 600V MOSgated Thyristor Achieved.</P>

<blockquote>
<B>Project Title:  Small Flywheel Battery Systems for Vehicle Power Management <p>
Performing Organization:Advanced Technology Program State of Texas, State Match Pool, Allied-Signal Aerospace, Avcon
Controls Inc., Central and Southwest Utilities</B><p>

<P>POINT OF CONTACT: Joe Beno <BR>
The University of Texas at Austin,<br>
Center for Electromechanics<br>
Telephone: (512) 4714496

<P><B>Program Summary: </B></P> 


<P>UTCEM is exploiting its high performance composite rotor technology, developed with over S20M of
DOD funding, to develop a stand alone flywheel battery system, complete with power electronics, for
vehicular applications. The flywheel will store 2kWh of energy, and produce 100150 kW of power and
will be field tested on a transit bus in the future Other members of the team, AVCON and Allied Signal
Aerospace Company, will provide complementing magnetic bearing and motor/generator expertise
respectively.
</P>
<P>The primary objective of the project is to develop dualuse stand alone flywheel battery systems, for
military and commercial applications Future military requirements for power averaging are more
demanding than commercial applications, and will demand the advanced rotor technology being
applied in this project. This becomes even more critical with the next generation of combat vehicles,
employing EM guns, EM suspensions and EM countermeasures. Until now, flywheel battery systems
have either been low risk and low performance devices or expensive, high risk, moderate performance
designs. Under this ARPA program, UTCEM will provide the advanced composite rotor technology,
developed in DOD programs, for the most demanding high performance flywheels. Additionally
UTCEM will develop techniques to reduce costs for the high performance rotor to be as low as or
lower than conventional wet wound filament technology.</P>

<P>This project, top fabricate a moderatecost high performance composite flywheel battery system,
capitalizes on an alliance of mass transit providers, university technology developers, and commercial
manufacturing entities. For this reason, the program structure encompasses the elements necessary
to develop the required production technology, formulate component manufacturing plans which are
guided by customer-driven system designs, and introduce the technology to the marketplace. Each
member of the alliance has a vested interest in producing these systems in large numbers and is
investing considerable resources to insure the success of the program with the ultimate goal of producing a commercially viable unit. Commercial viability will also be enhanced by the composite rotor manufacturing tasks to reduce fabrication costs in the project.</P>

<P>In a companion project, UTCEM is leading an effort to develop safety and containment technology to
enable future vehicle integration and field demonstration. This effort is being conducted by a team of
the leading U.S. Flywheel battery developers, DOE National Laboratories, and the leading U.S spin
test facility.
</P>
<P>The program schedule will have preliminary testing of the UTCEM flywheel battery in early summer
1996; final flywheel battery testing and cyclical duty cycle testing in Fall 1996; containment and
flywheel ring burst testing from April 1996May 1997; integration into a transit bus in early 1997; and
field testing in midlate 1997.</P>

<B>Project Title:  Energy Management Controller<p>
Performing Organization:  Delco Electronics </B><p>

<P>Technical Contact:  Dr. Larry Wnuk, (310) 517-5748</P>

<P><B>Program Description</B></P>


<P>Delco Electronics, based in Torrance California, will develop and Energy Management Controller (EMC) for electric and hybrid electric vehicles (E/HEV) including buses.  The overall goal of the effort is to significantly increase the efficiency of energy use in an E/HEV through system level control.  The EMC will perform as a system controller, able to monitor status signals and provide control signals to E/HEV subsystems such as auxiliary power unit (APU), battery pack monitor/battery management devices, traction motor controller and drive unit, high and low voltage distribution boxes as well as chargeport.  Performance gains and efficiency gains are expected from improved control of power sources and loads.  Improved control is expected to reduce stresses on the battery resulting in extended cycle life and lower operating costs.  Ultimately,  the development and implementation of algorithms is expected to reduce net emissions for HEVs through improved control of the APU.</P>
	
<P><B>Milestones</B></P>

<P>By mid-1996, Delco Electronics will design the prototype energy management controller.  By year's end, Delco Electronics will test the controller on a CALSTART hybrid electric bus.</P>

<B>Project Title:  EV Safety Issues and the Safety & Liability Roadmap<p>

Performing Organization:  Hudson Institute, Northwest Diversified Services</B><p>

<P>Technical POC: Dr. Jim Wheeler, Hudson, (317) 5451537<br>
Mike Beebe, NDS, (419) 6215512 
<P>
<B>Project Summary:</B></P>

<P>Electric Vehicle development has been accelerated in the past few years due to mandates in
several states. The use of electric vehicles is expected to be the greatest since the turn of the century. Since many
more electric vehicles will be present on the highways, the changes of accidents will increase with these additional
miles driven. These vehicles will have a greater probability of interacting with the existing vehicle fleet and
infrastructure. This concern has caused many different groups to look at possible voids in current standards and
regulations. Currently, the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE), Electricore Power Research Institute's (EPRI)
Health and Safety committee, Department of Energy's (DOE) Battery Readiness Committee European standards
committees, and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) have begun to review, test, and
develop draft standards. Besides the groups reviewing design and infrastructure issues of electric vehicles,
insurance companies will need to know what the cost of repair and safety durability will be for these new vehicles.
Therefore, each vehicle developed in the DARPA program will need to be kept aware of all these issues to maximize
the market potential for the vehicle being developed.</P>

<P>Electric vehicle safety issues have become one of the major issues which could inhibit the emergence of a viable
electric vehicle industry. New standards and recommended practices are currently being developed by the major
manufacturers and suppliers. The vehicles developed for the DARPA consortia have not had the ongoing capacities
of attending or being a part of each of these committees. It is important that each vehicle development team in the
DARPA consortia understand and are current on each of the new draft safety requirements from these committees.
If these items are not designed into their vehicles in the early stages of development, thousands, or millions, of
dollars may be required to redesign the vehicles later. This could cost these new vehicle manufacturers market
share or eliminate them all together from consideration. </P>

<P>It has been recognized by Electricore that each DARPA consortia should have guidance concerning vehicle safety
issues during the development of electric vehicles. As a result, Electricore has taken on the effort of crash testing
one of their own electric conversions and sharing the information, creating a safety course for electric vehicle and
hybrid users, and is currently compiling a study concerning the safety, environmental, and liability challenges facing
the introduction of electric and hybrid vehicles into the marketplace. The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE),
Department of Energy's (DOE) Battery Readiness Committee, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
(NHTSA), and the Electric Power Research Institute's (EPRI) Health and Safety Committee, are currently working on
electric vehicle safety standards and recommendations. This project is intended to coordinate all the current safety
efforts within the DARPA consortia. The project will consist of three parts with principal investigator, Michael S.
Beebe from NDS, Inc., responsible for attending SAFE, DOE Battery Readiness Committee meetings, etc., and
reporting a summary to the DARPA consortia; coordination of all safety testing for each DARPA consortia; to assist
DARPA consortia members on electric vehicle development issues as they pertain to safety. Visits to each
consortia will be done as required.</P>

<P><B>Project Deliverables: </B></P><P>Safety & liability roadmap study report, safety issues summary report</P>

<P><B>Program Description</B></P>
	

<P>Jefferson Programmed Power is a new firm developing and manufacturing programmable, low-cost OEM DC controllers for electric vehicle use. Through the use of microprocessors and sophisticated software, these controllers will help to improve the performance and extend the range of electric vehicles with DC drive trains.   In particular, the controller should be able to make greater use of energy created through regenerative braking.  The company's goals will be to design controllers for ease of use, high-volume manufacturability, applicability, and low cost. The controllers will have a variety of parameters that can be selected and scaled by OEMs for customization, including throttle responsiveness, turbo or passing gear current limits, temperature compensated current limits, and electronically controlled braking. This new firm, Jefferson Programmed Power (JPP), will launch its operations at the CALSTART business incubator at the Alameda Naval Air Station in Northern California.  Aware of the need for such a product, a number of small electric vehicle manufacturers have agreed to test this new controller in their vehicles.

<B>Project Title: EMI measurement & Mitigation Testing Through CT EVS<p>
Performing Organization: U.S. Naval Undersea Warfare Center </B>

<P><B>Project Summary</B></P>


<P>Project: RA95 Task 20<br>
Submitted by: U.S. Naval Undersea Warfare Center<br>
Connecticut Municipal Electric Energy Cooperative </P>

<P>Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) is an unintentional form of Electromagnetic Energy
that can often effect both the performance of the system creating the interference as well
as external systems. An extreme example of EMI is the case of electric vehicles causing
the inadvertent activation of bomb release mechanisms on aircraft. EMI typically
manifests itself as a loss of performance in systems that are exposed to the interference,
e.g., communication range is reduced, computers malfunction, or monitoring systems
fail. For this task, the Electric Vehicle (EV) will be used to evaluate the potential
emissions of the EV when used in today's hostile commercial EM environment. Our
approach will asses these risks including the possibility of the EV creating undesirable
EMI emissions that can effect others systems. The EV may also be susceptible to EMI
from the environment however the emphasis in this proposal will be directed toward
identification of EMI emissions from electric vehicles. In addition, we will seek to identify
appropriate EMI abatement techniques. When the responsible party has implemented
the recommended corrective measures, we will retest the particular vehicle or
component to ensure desired performance.</P>

<P>Electric vehicles can have military as well as civilian applications. On the battle space
stealth is of fundamental importance. Vehicles can therefore gain a degree of stealth by
converting to electric drive vice internal combustion engine. As such, this proposal Will
identify the critical EMI issues that effect military electric vehicles on the battle space.
The measurement of electromagnetic emissions from both military as well as civilian
vehicles will be useful in creating an EV emission data base. This data base will then be
used to identify those EMI emissions issues that effect EV performance. </P>

<B>Project Title: Lifecycle Testing of Composite Flywheel Energy Storage Systems<p>
Performing Organization: U.S. Flywheel Systems, Inc.</B><p>

<P>Technical Contact: Mahesh Talwar  (805) 961-8922</P>

<P><B>Program Description</B></P>

<P>U.S. Flywheel Systems has developed a high-energy density composite rotor flywheel energy storage system, with a projected capability of enduring 10,000 charge/discharge cycles (the equivalent of approximately 27 years of normal operations).  This project will test a sample of four flywheel modules under controlled accelerated cycling regimes, to determine the actual durability and failure modes of these energy storage systems.</P>

<P>The flywheel modules developed by U.S. Flywheel Systems (USFS) have the following characteristics:</P>


<BLOCKQUOTE><P><TABLE CELLPADDING=2>
<TR><TD>Specific Power</TD><TD>2000 W/kg</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>Specific Energy</TD><TD>150 W-hr/kg</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>Energy Density</TD><TD>4.4 k Wh</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>Recharge Time</TD><TD>10-20 minutes</TD></TR>
</TABLE></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>In this year-long program, USFS will use a proprietary state-of-the-art data acquisition system, using 125 sensors and data channels per flywheel, to measure 3-dimensional strain profiles under repeated cyclic testing, and to attempt to predict material yield prior to system failure.
</P>
<P><B>Milestones</B></P>

<P>The modules will be tested intensively until failure or five months of consecutive cycling are accomplished.</P>

<B>Project Title:  Electrosource Sfold Battery for Hybrid EVs<p>
Performing Organization:  Electrosource, Inc.</B><p>

<P>Technical POC: Steve Addington (512) 4456606</P>

<P><B>Project Summary: </B></P><P>Development of a high voltage and high specific power battery
configuration that is necessary for a PNGV serial hybrid electric vehicle design to
deliver comparable performance to an ICE vehicle. The S-fold battery for hybrid EVs
will outstrip all competitive technologies by providing:</P>

<P><UL>
<LI>     round trip energy efficiency approaching 90% 
<LI>     short, low impedance current paths  excellent conductance 
<LI>     predicted 750 to 1000 watts/kg specific power  excellent for hybrid applications 
<LI>     will maintain 50 win/kg specific energy 
<LI>     battery design using the basic components of the proven Electrosource Horizon batteries which should permit faster development of Sfold battery 
<LI>     use of standard Horizon(D lead acid plates allowing low target cost of $150/kwh</UL> </P>

<P>By optimizing the already proven power characteristics of the Horizon battery, an
even higher specific power can be achieved without sacrificing energy density. This
is done by stacking the folded plates interleaved with separators. The capacity of the
Sfold configuration is determined by the area of the grid, five (5) amperehours, for
this project. Other capacities are possible with different grid sizes. This geometry
provides high voltage in a compact package.</P>

<P>By using the same raw materials in the two configurations below, early realization of
a useful battery will permit faster development of the other systems required for
marketable fuel cell and other hybrid vehicles. This graph shows how the SFold
battery compares with other energy storage devices:</P>
<UL>
<P>How Standard Horizon Battery and SFold Battery Configurations Differ: The
standard plates consist of a positive and negative pasted grid approximately 4"
square which are placed in a different geometry for the standard Horizon battery and
the Sfold battery. </P>

<P>Plates are stacked horizontally, positive grid of the plate in the first layer overlapped
by the negative grid in the second layer with an electrolyte separator placed between
the grids. </P>

<P>Folded plates are stacked in a column, interleaved with electrolyte bearing separator
material.</P>
</UL>
<P><B>SFold Battery for Hybrid Vehicle The Standard Horizon Design</B></P>

<P><UL>
<LI>12 volt batteries  24 or 50 volt batteries 
<LI>85 or 95 amphour capacity  5 amphour capacity 
<LI>6 stacks of grid pairs in series  17  12 or 25 grid pairs, or 19 grid pairs per stack  specific power of 750 to 1000 w/kg 
<LI>specific power of 220 to 280 w/kg  5.5" wide x 5.5" long x 3.5" or 7" high 
<LI>5.5" wide x 30" long x 5.5" high  for hybrid EVs, portable equipment, electric  for long range pure electric vehicles bicycles, etc.</UL></P>

<P><B>Project Deliverables:</B> </P>

<P>Two designs will be constructed and tested as part of this project: </P>

<P><UL>
<LI>     24 volt modules will be constructed in the "Sfold" configuration and a performance benchmark for this geometry will be established. 
<LI>     50 volt modules will be constructed and tested. 
<LI>     Results will be used to define chemistry changes and plate configuration
<LI>     modifications needed to optimize the design for performance and production. </UL></P>

<P><B>Project Schedule: </B></P>

<P>This fifteen month project will provide the threestep development of the optimized
"Sfold" battery for hybrid applications. Once the battery configuration is optimized,
the next step of design and tooling for the production battery can be completed in six
to nine months.</P>

<P>RA93 Crash, Fire and Rescue Training Course: Course was intended to provide guidance to
operators and rescue personnel in the event of an accident. A draft of the course has been completed. Final
production is currently on hold as more information is gathered. The crash testing of one Electricore electric pickup
was documented with the intent of using this information in this course. Other crash and safety test results
consortiawide will also be included. Driver certification was conducted at each user site so as to insure proper
operation of the vehicles. These training sessions were conducted in the summer of 1995 for the electric pickup
trucks. Further training will be provided as Electricore's hybrid electric buses are fielded. Driver certification and
training is done in conjunction with the perspective vehicle manufacturer. </P>

<B>Project Title:  Flywheel Magnetic Bearing Improvements<p>

Performing Organization:  AVCON	
</B><p>

<P>Technical Contact:  Graham Jones, Avcon (818) 865-0250 voice mail, (818) 865-0206 fax<BR>
email:  AVCON@IX.NETCOM..COM</P>

<P><B>Program Description</B></P>

<P>AVCON has manufactured nine magnetic bearings for two different flywheel system designs and is currently under contract to manufacture magnetic bearings for four more flywheel projects.  The technology is now well established, and delivered systems are performing well.  There is a strong future for these type of bearings in flywheel applications.</P>

<P>For all flywheel applications the minimization of losses in the bearing is essential to achieve energy efficiency and cost effectiveness with the overall units.  The two main sources of power loss are the drag torque and the rotor heating which result from the eddy currents induced in the magnetic bearing rotor.  The drag torque is a continuous drain on the flywheel stored energy, and the rotor heating, inside the vacuum chamber, has to be removed by a cooling system.</P>

<P>During prototype testing the eddy current effect has not been shown to be significant.  For production units, however, it will be important to achieve the absolute minimum levels of eddy current losses.  This project will provide the data against which developing design tools can be correlated.</P>

<P>Currently there are no reliable design tools for accurate determination of these losses or for design optimization for minimum losses.  AVCON plans, therefore to develop such tools to improve the performance of high-speed magnetic bearing systems.</P>

<P>The program will begin with the analysis and optimization of magnetic bearing design, using computerized magnetic analysis and finite element analysis tools to select the most promising hardware configurations.  A full 5-axis active magnetic levitation system will then be fabricated, along with the necessary test rig, to measure and compare that rotor losses of the optimized system to an existing design.  This program will focus on minimizing or eliminating hysteresis effects and eddy-current generation, particularly at high rotational speeds.</P>


<P><B>Milestones</B></P>	
<P>
AVCON will design, fabricate, test and optimized magnetic bearing energy storage flywheel in 12 months.</P>

funded through ARPA. Like in Phase 1 these vehicles mull be leased to commuters. It is
expected these vehicles will travel 100 miles between charges.</P>

<P>The Massachusetts Division of Energy Resources, issued an RFP for these vehicles in
April, they hope to have them on the road by August.</P>

In addition to funding from APRA, the Massachusetts Electric Vehicles Program is funded
<P>through The Massachusetts Division of Energy Resources, Federal Highway Adm.,

<B>Project Title:  Dual-Use Turbogenerator Development<p>

Performing Organization:  AlliedSignal Aerospace</B><p>

<P>Technical Contact:	Charles Weinstein (310) 512-4127</P>

<P><B>Program Description</B></P>

<P>AlliedSignal Aerospace is developing and will deploy a 50-kw turbogenerator in dual-use applications.  The turbogenerator was placed into an M-1 A-1 tank and will be placed into an electric bus operated by Delco Electronics. </P> 

<P>Advances in this turbogenerator include the use of  air bearings, which eliminate the need for oil or other lubricants.  the generator is built into the shaft and rotates at the same speed as the shaft, so there is no gearbox, which eliminates a considerable number of moving parts.  The unit was designed to be low cost, compact, and quiet.  This turbogenerator could contribute to the development of a hybrid electric vehicle capable of exceeding the mileage goal of the Partnership for a Next Generation Vehicle (PNGV).  </P>

<P>AlliedSignal is a company with $14 billion in sales.  The Garrett Automotive Group within AlliedSignal is the World's largest manufacturer of automotive turbo-machinery.  AlliedSignal is also the World's largest supplier of small gas turbines.  </P>
	
<P><B>Milestones</B></P>

<P>The turbogenerator will be developed and installed in the Delco Electronics test bus in 1996.</P>

<B>Project Title: SmartCoolTM Air Condition System  Electric Bus<p>

Performing Organization: Smart Power Systems</B><p>

<P>Technical POC: Gregg Peterson, (810) 6820203</P>

<P><B>Project Summary:</B></P>

<P>The project objective is to develop a highefficiency, lightweight air conditioning system for
electric buses. The system is based on a new twostage centrifugal compressor with an integral DC brushless
permanent magnet motor designed by Smart Power Systems. The system uses a low pressure environmentally
friendly refrigerant; system pressures are typically 15 psi to 30 pSI. The nominal design output is 18,000 BTU/hr;
the maximum design capacity is 21,000 BTU/hr. The theoretical compressor input power at 18,000 BTU/hr is less
than 1,400 watts at the ASHRAE highefficiency rating point. Input power is substantially reduced as a function of
ambient conditions. As an example, modeling the system at the ASHRAE SEER rating point yields an output of
over 8,000 BTU/hr using less than 400 watts of compressor input power.</P> 

<P>The SmartCool centrifugal compressor weighs under 10 pounds and is 30% smaller than similar capacity electric
R134a compressors. </P>

<P>A microprocessor continuously monitors and controls all system parameters with millisecond response times and
ensures that the compressor is operating at its highest efficiency at all times. Computercontroller functions
include compressor motor speed, condenser fan speed, evaporator fan speed, and expansion valve setting</P>.

<P>In addition to the centrifugal compressor and the control electronics, the module incorporates highefficiency air
moving devices, plate fin heat exchangers, an electronic expansion valve and condensate reclamation to further
enhance performance. Composite materials are used throughout the module to minimize weight</P>.

<P><B>Project Deliverables: </B></P>

<P>Three roofmounted 324 VDC SmartCool modules will be installed on an AVS electric bus
and evaluated this summer. The objective is to improve the a/c operational efficiency and reduce the a/c system
weight by 400 pounds.</P>

<P><B>Project Schedule:</B></P>

<P> QTR2 1966 installation target  performance evaluations and engineering enhancements to
continue through the end of the contract (2/97).

<P>

<STRONG>  It is our great pleasure to extend to you this invitation to join
a newly formed, innovative and collaborative venture known as the
Mountain Forum.  Originating from activities preceding the 1992
Earth Summit, the Mountain Forum offers a venue for global linkage of
individuals and organizations concerned with mountain cultures,
environment and sustainable development. We invite your active
participation. 
<p>
  The purpose of the Mountain Forum is to provide a forum for
mutual support and for the exchange of ideas and experiences. 
This will empower participants to raise mountain issues on local,
national, regional, and international agendas and to promote
policies and actions for equitable and ecologically sustainable
mountain development.  The basic operational values of the
Mountain Forum are to be open, democratic, decentralized,
accessible, transparent, accountable, and flexible.
<P>
  As an innovative and integrative bridge between diverse
constituencies, the Mountain Forum is committed to having a
completely open and broad membership.  It includes mountain
communities, non-governmental organizations, scholars,
researchers and research initiatives, individuals, groups and
institutions that specialize in mountain-related issues, private
associations and organizations, and intergovernmental and
governmental bodies.

  There are no fees necessary to become a member of the Mountain
Forum.  To become a member, simply complete and <A HREF=/mtnforum/survey/survey.htm#top>submit the attached Registration Form and Survey</A> (via fax, mail or
electronically) to your regional node (see below for regional
contact points).  Members will receive formal confirmation from
their regional node, regular dissemination of internal
publications and newsletters, announcements, updates on events,
and the general opportunity for participation in all activities
related to the Mountain Forum--electronically via the Mountain
Forum's electronic discussion list and traditionally via the regional networks.
<P>
 Before signing up, we encourage you to read the information presented below to understand how the Mountain Forum operates. Membership in the Mountain Forum is free of charge. If you do not wish to become a member of the Mountain Forum, you are still welcome and encouraged to participate in the <A HREF=/mtnforum/survey/survey.htm#top>electronic discussions.</A>
<P>
<H3>
Participation in the Mountain Forum
(Activities and How to become involved)
</H3>
<P>
Through improved communications and information exchange, the
Mountain Forum will empower and enrich all members; create and
strengthen mechanism for critical dialogue; exchange both
successful and unsuccessful experiences; provide a forum for
discussing emerging tools and technologies and their
applications; exchange lessons on monitoring, evaluating and
assessing impacts; and assist members in influencing regional
mountain agendas at the local, national and intergovernmental
levels.  The following activities are some examples of how
Mountain Forum members can actively foster mutual support:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>    Share knowledge, information, experiences with the mountain
     community and interested parties, via the Information Server
     Node (ISN) and regional networks.
<P>
<LI>    Suggest and direct sources of information (documents,
     reports, materials) useful or relevant to the global
     mountain community.  Alternatively, one may make requests
     for support, advice or information to Mountain Forum
     constituents.
<P>
<LI>    Support and respond to inquiries and requests made by other
     Mountain Forum participants.   Support would include the
     sharing of relevant data and information on focused topics,
     or in response to other participants' research and
     activities.
<P>
<LI>    Assume personal responsibility for the dissemination of
     relevant and important information to Mountain Forum
     participants without Internet access.  This responsibility
     likewise extends to the inclusion of input from participants
     without access to the Internet.
<P>
<LI>    Identify potential participants and members and involve them
     in Mountain Forum activities.
<P>
<LI>    Work with other members to form alliances, partnerships and
     joint research activities at the local, regional, and global
     levels.
   </UL>    <P>
Mountain Forum participants are encouraged to promote and
raise the awareness of mountain issues at local, national,
regional and global levels.  Successful advocacy should result in raising
mountain issues on the agendas of national decision makers, donor
agencies and international organizations.  Specific actions that
participants can initiate relevant to advocacy include but are
not limited to:
<P><UL>
<LI>    facilitating dialogue and improved communications between
     mountain communities and national decision makers;
<P>
<LI>    convening local, national and regional workshops and task
     forces around relevant mountain issues; 
<P>
<LI>    informing national decision makers via these workshops,
     briefings and media coverage;
<P>
<LI>    encouraging the formation of a mountain lobby which involves
     stakeholders and decision makers;
<P>
<LI>    contributing directly to the review and implementation of
     UNCED document Agenda 21, Chapter 13 "Managing Fragile
     Ecosystems: Sustainable Mountain Development".

The Mountain Forum is a decentralized network comprised of five regional networks. 
Activities and membership for each region are coordinated by Regional Facilitating
Committees (RFC).  The governing body of the Mountain Forum is the Interim
Facilitating Committee (IFC) comprised of a group of representatives from each
Regional Facilitating Committee, and a Global Facilitating Committee (GFC) which
coordinates non-regionally affiliated members.  Below is a listing of the existing
Regional and Global  Facilitating Committee members:

The <FONT COLOR="#990000"> <STRONG>Mountain Forum</STRONG> <FONT COLOR="#000000">e-conference consists of four discussion lists, with additional lists to be added as participation expands.  The most recent addition is the Latin American discussion list:
<P>
     i.  "<STRONG>mtn-forum</STRONG>"   This is the common area of the Mountain
Forum.  All who wish to subscribe are welcome and encouraged to
participate in the open discussion.  This list is moderated to
promote discussion.
<P>
     ii.  "<STRONG>mf-intro</STRONG>"   A list dedicated to introducing
subscribers to one another.  New subscribers are asked to post a
few sentences describing themselves and their interest in the
Mountain Forum discussion list.  Just as in a face-to-face
conference, we tend to feel more comfortable in the discussion as
we begin to get to know each other.
<P>
     iii.  "<STRONG>mf-summary</STRONG>"   A weekly read-only summary of the
topics discussed in the open "mtn-forum" list.  This summary is
simply a list made up of the subject line of each posting in the
last week, and a repeat posting of important announcements and
information newly available on-line.  As additional discussion
lists are opened within the Mountain Forum, this weekly summary
will help indicate when and where the active discussion is taking
place.  For those subscribers who do not wish to receive the full
traffic of the open lists, this summary provides a concise way to
stay in touch with what's happening in the Mountain Forum.  <P>

iv. "<STRONG>mf-lac</STRONG>"  This moderated discussion list focusses on biodiversity and agriculture in the Andes.  It will be conducted in Spanish and all Spanish-speakers with an interest in this area are encouraged to participate.

<FONT SIZE=2>We are pleased to present to you the results of the
Mountain Forum membership survey, conducted in order to obtain
baseline demographic information on Mountain Forum constituents,
as well as information on members' electronic capabilities, regional
interests and affiliation, and hopes for the Forum. Background
data from surveys provide a powerful tool to help guide and shape
the Mountain Forum's evolution. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>From June through mid-October 1996, 201people had
submitted survey forms to the Mountain Forum's regional offices.
This report was complied by the Information Server Node, and reflect
global Mountain Forum membership. Survey results will be updated
every three months with the next scheduled update for February
28, 1997. <I>(Note: Many questions allowed for multiple answers,
thus totals may be more than 201 members, and percentages may
total more than 100%).<BR>

<LI><B><FONT SIZE=2>Suggestions: Following is a long list of s</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>uggestions
members indicated on their survey forms (Though very much appreciated,
greetings of a personal nature have not been included in this
list):</FONT>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>Consideration for input support for fast networking
communication due to absence of e-mail service</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>A &quot;pin board&quot; would be useful for information
requests, news, etc.</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>Better special efforts to establish relations
with the African Mountain Association</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>Choice at present not to use electronic !</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>Community outreach - work hard to ensure that
the inputs of mountain inhabitants are included in policy decisions
and recommendations</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>Conduct field training and surveys</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>Create an expert system for accessing databases
&amp; knowledge bases</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>Create an electronic resource database on mountain
topics/issues</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>Direct meetings</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>E-mail is now a system in Turkey, but not easily
accessible. Therefore, I also prefer written, paper communication</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>Electronic change of real images (scanned images)
which may help us create publications. This change of images must
be based on a database w/ scanned images, &amp; can be an attractive
facilitation.</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>Establish a list of interesting &amp; innovative
integrated &amp; sustainable development projects or case studies
all over the mountain areas of the world</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>Exchange of ideas through debates, discussion,
meeting, seminar and workshops</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>Focus on peoples' real work and involve community
leaders</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>For regular &amp; effective participation in
Mountain Forum activities it would have been more appropriate
for me to acquire the communication package (laptop) &amp; a modem.</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>Further interest in dry zone mountains</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>Growth will be demand-driven</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>Help supporting regional directories of organizations
active in mountain policies, research &amp; development (see Earthwatch
Gems directory for i.e.)</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>Help get off-line members &amp; small network
coordinators on-line.</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>How could we contribute to this forum if we don't
have the technical facilities yet?</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>I moderate an InSitu list called &quot;Workshop
in Situ95 or 96&quot;</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>I need a personal computer to be more efficient
inside the electronic networking services of the Mountain Forum.
A Macintosh?</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>I think the opportunity should be taken to develop
in Mountain Forum an OPEN LEARNING/DISTANCE TEACHING function
as in the UK (Open University which has 1/4 million students)
but also exploring a more popular medium.</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>If possible do what HimNet did for non-geological
topics;</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>In most cases with developing countries, modern
electronic communication advances are still very scanty.</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>We are planning a network activity across Europe
to draw together databases on mountain biodiversity. These you
can have when completed.</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>Include a list of other electronic resources
which could supplement the Mountain Forum</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>Incorporating the archives as suggested previously,
pending demand</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>International contacts and regional programs</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>Inter-relate the UIAA with the Mountain Forum</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>Is this all electronic or will you still do paper
mailings?</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>It is essential that the regions of Africa, Europe
and North America agree on a regional contact point ASAP in order
to reinforce and maintain the nature of decentralized regionally
based organization</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>It needs to review the impact of its activities
in various governmental and non-governmental sectors. This will
provide a clear view of its necessity.</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>It will be helpful to seriously consider the
need to provide interested groups like ours with some basic communication
facilities e.g. basic equipment to link with email.</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>Link home page to Mountain Forum home page</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>List members by country and list their work as
well.</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>List of members (as a data-bank) with specialties</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>Monitor carefully the balance of grass-roots,
NGO, government, and intergovernmental organizations in Mountain
Forum; it is essential that governments feel motivated to join
and participate actively</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>My Institute has few computers which are under
use for other Institute matters.</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>Offering abstracts of interesting books and articles</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>Opening a documentation center in Himachal Pradesh</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>Organize periodic face to face seminars/conferences
at regional level on particular theme related to mountains</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>Post the same list to all newcomers 1-3 months
from now</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>Produce listing of other mountain-related lists</FONT>

hard) w/ general updates from regions, articles on topics of interest,
news &amp; events, reports of mtgs, new initiatives &amp; summaries
of on-line discussions.</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>Provide e-mail and other lists of colleagues</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>Provide easy-to-access copies of papers, listed
or organized in logical manner</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>Publish an electronic newsletter focusing on
different issues and/or regions with each issue</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>Publish some book referring to the shown interest
of the people who participate in this forum.I mean to include
these chapters in that book.I think that the most important issue
is how to protect mountain ecosystems for us and future generations
w/ all positive moments which rise w/ the previous.</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>Reports on projects in the different regions
would be very informative &amp; would perhaps have fewer copyright
concerns.</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>Response of mountaineers to mountain problems</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>Sharing scholarly information between practitioners
&amp; academics that users can read. Not just bibliographies but
full articles as possible within copyright limitations</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>Shorter messages to ensure more frequent use
of the forum</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>Simpler instructions to access services thus
a service to learn how to access a,b,c, etc.</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>Since it is not possible to find Internet in
E. Europe, is there another institution specialized in mountain
problems that can help us with the dissemination of useful information.?</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>Solicit &quot;papers&quot;</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>Start with prepared materials to break the ice,
present participation is a little like teenagers at a dance;</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>Telephone/fax accessibility is at the moment
easy with me. The only bottleneck are computers &amp; the accompanying
accessories.</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>The forum could usefully provide a metadata base
of information on all computer networks related to mountain areas</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>To have a regional meeting in every region</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>Training programs to train regional partners
on ecofriendly technology</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>We would like you create focal points for each
country</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>What about the areas without electronic access?</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>What is needed are selected materials uploaded
onto a Web site and a back up Tutor assistance service.</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>Would like to receive the same information through
the post or phone/fax</FONT>

mountains on the global environment agenda.<BR>

<FONT SIZE=6>1 Why Focus on Mountains?<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B>Mountains are an important source of water, energy and biological
diversity.  Furthermore, they are a source of such key resources
as minerals, forest, agricultural products and recreation.  As
a major ecosystem representing the complex and interrelated ecology
of our planet, mountain environments are essential to the survival
of the global ecosystem.&quot;  Agenda 21, Chapter 13.<BR>
</B>
<P>
<B>What are mountains?<BR>
</B>
<P>
There is no clear definition of mountains and highlands and perhaps
this will always be so, because mountains with different altitudes
and specific patterns of ecosystems are found on every continent,
from the equator to the polar regions.  Given their three-dimenesional
nature, they encompass the most extensive array of topography,
climate, flora and fauna, as well as human cultural differentiation,
known on earth.  In lieu of an overly simplistic definition with
altitude above sea level, mountains can be characterised by their
altitudinal succession of different climatic, geomorphic, and
vegetational belts.  Regardless of absolute altitudes, mountains
include all areas of a marked relief with significan ecological
differences and slopes which are susceptible to natural hazards
and human activities.<BR>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>46.7%  of the total area of the continents is above
500m;  26.9% above 1000m; and 11.1% over 2000m.  These simple
figures show that Mountains and Highlands are indeed a major ecosystem
of our planet!<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B>Mountains in the historical perspective <BR>
</B>
<P>
Mountains and highlands have always played an important role in
the history of humankind.  In the beginning, they were experienced
as both frightening and divine, and were often used as a refuge
by persecuted groups and tribes (e.g. Kirdi in Cameroon).  Lowland
people mostly perceived mountain inhabitants as barbarian and
unlawful.  Later on, mountain valleys and passes became important
for  traffic and transport.  Improved economic conditions, together
with increasing strategic significance, served as the nucleus
for the formation of mountain states (e.g. Switzerland).  Scientific
interests (e.g. Saussure, Rousseau) and subsequent enthusiasm
for mountains has grown in the last few centuries, followed by
the conquest of the high summits (e.g. Everest 1952).  Since then,
mountain, human, and natural resources have been recognized and
have become the focus of new attention from humankind.<BR>
<P>
<B>Mountain Resources for the 21<FONT SIZE=1>st</FONT> Century
<BR>
</B>
<P>
Agenda 21, chapter 13 was a great step forward towards realising
the resource potential of the mountain world.  One of the major
problems in the next century will be water shortage;  more than
half the world's fresh water comes from the mountains and highlands.
 Biodiversity is being threatened throughout the world:  The mountains,
especially in the tropics, are treasures of diversity for future
generations.  Since Rio, knowledge and information have been improved,
not only about water and biodiversity, but also about energy,
timber, minerals, agriculture, tourism, etc.  Preserving the diversity
of mountain ecosystems also means understanding cultural diversity,
including the religious, easthetic, ethic, and recreational significance
of mountains for humankind.<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<B>Significance of the mountain chapter in Agenda 21<BR>
</B>
<P>
Chapter 13 has two programme areas:  <BR>
<P>
<B>Generating and strengthening
knowledge about the ecology and sustainable development of mountain
ecosystems,</B> 
<P>
<B>Promoting integrated watershed
development and alternative livelihood opportunities.</B><BR>
<P>
In the first debates the question for the necessity of a special
mountain chapter arose.  It was argued that all the elements of
maountin areas are included in other chapters or conventions of
Agenda 21, i.e. Combating Deforestation, Sustainable Agriculture
and Rural Development, Conservation of Biological Diversity, Protecting
and Managing Fresh Water, Combating Poversy, Strengtheninmg the
Role of Indigenous People, Partnerships with NGO's, Science for
Sustainable development, etc.  It is true that mountain problems
have a connection to all these chapters, but it would be a great
error to split the fragile ecosystems of our world, like the tropical
rainforests, the arid zones, the coastal zones, etc. into many
independent sectors.  Preservation of fragile ecosystems, especially
the mountain ecosystems with their precious resources for our
future, requires research and integrated development programmes
with a stronger emphasis on linkages between economic, cultural,
and ecologic aspects.  Sustainable mountain development has to
be approached in a more comprehensive way.  <BR>
<P>
<B>Awareness of mountains since Rio, Agenda 21<BR>
</B>
<P>
A large number of organizations, NGOs, governmental institutions,
research centres, and private individuals have suddenly shown
more interest in sustainable mountain development.  Since Rio
and itsAgenda 21, mountains have been less marginalised.  A growing
urbanised world population is beginning to recognize the value
of human and natural resources of mountain areas.  Governments
are beginning to realise that long-term mountain policies are
needed.  Mountains and highlands become a focus of humanity into
the 21<FONT SIZE=1>st</FONT> century.<BR>

</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=5>Dynamic environments: living with uncertainty<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B>Mountains are high&#173;energy environments. This brings many
challenges to planning their diverse uses, especially in relation
to minimizing the natural hazards that result from high rain&#173;
and snowfall, variations in temperature, steep slopes, seismic
activity and tectonic movement. The risks associated with mountain
environments are growing rapidly with increases in resident and
visiting populations, intensification and diversification of land
uses, and the construction of infrastructure. Risk assessment
and management are of ever greater importance.<BR>
</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Right: The eruption of volcanoes is one of the greatest
hazards for the populations of mountain areas and the world. When
Mount Pinatubo, Philippines, erupted in 1991, 6-8 billion m3 of
hot volcanic debris were ejected, destroying 350 km2 of land.
The eruption affected more than 400,000 people directly, and 1.5
million indirectly; it influenced the global climate for three
years. The 1993 eruption of Lascar, Chile, is shown here. Fallout
led to the closure of schools 200 km away. (Photo: Mina El Laco)

<P>
<B>Moving mountains<BR>
</B>
<P>
Mountains include some of the most dynamic landscapes on Earth.
The collision of continental plates &#173; the origin of mountain
building &#173; results in earth quakes and volcanic eruptions.
Mountains intercept moisture from the atmosphere, resulting in
both large amounts and high intensities of precipitation, causing
snow and ice avalanches and floods. A central concern is to minimize
such events, and to keep the water in the mountains to be used
productively before flowing downhill. The long, steep slopes of
mountains are characterized by the downwards movement not only
of water and snow, but also rocks and soil. While some processes
are rapid &#173; lava and pyroclastic flows, rockslides, rockfalls,
debris flows &#173; gradual processes, such as soil erosion, can
equally put the lives of mountain people at risk. Soil erosion
derives not only from the steepness of slopes, but also from human
mismanagement or other dynamic aspects of the mountain environment
such as heavy rainfall, strong wind, and changes in temperature.
<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Each year, Cherrapunji, Megalaya Hills of Bangladesh,
receives an average of 11.1 metros of</FONT>

<FONT SIZE=2>rainfall. In 1974, the total rainfall was 23.7 etres,
more than anywhere else on Earth. 8.2 metres of this fell in July.
</FONT>

<FONT SIZE=2>The origin of this rainfall is the convective clouds
formed as air rises over the mountains. (Photo T. Hofer)<BR>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Avoiding catastrophes<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
Mountain people who have long experience of a mountain area understand
the locations and likelihoods of natural hazards and catastrophes
of moderate magnitude and frequency. Mountain people avoid dangerous
areas, or take measures to control hazards. However, such knowledge
is not always used or recognized, particularly if the hazard is
a process as slow as soil erosion. Catastrophic events such as
glacial lake outbursts and debris avalanches related to volcanic
eruptions may have long return periods or may be triggered by
multiple causes. Consequently, they are very difficult to predict,
and are hardly recognized in people's perceptions. Rapid and desastrous
events are often confined to valleys, where human settlements,
transport and other infrastructure are concentrated. The potential
for losses of lives and property may be very high.<BR>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>left: There is a delicate balance in using steep
mountain slopes. Valuable agricuHural land can be lost when cultivation
is practiced on too steep slopes, as here in the Kakani valley,
Nepal, where an exceptional monsoon rain triggered this landslide.

<BR>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The importance of protecting Andermatt, Switzerland,
from avalanches was already recognized by a local law in 1397.

avalanche protection structures. (Photo: Swiss Airforce)<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The risk of landslides Is a growing problem for urban
areas, such as the densely&#173;populated Jizukiyama area of Nagano
Prefecture, Japan. Heavy rain caused this landslide, which killed
26 people. Rehabilitation and stabilization cost S100 million.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=5>Mountain ecosystems: fragile and diverse<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B>Mountain plant and animal communities are resilient because
of their diversity of species, with many strategies for survival;
but fragile because they may need long periods of time to recover
when damaged or stressed beyond a certain point, or when key species
or soil are removed. The results may not be merely degradedecosystems,
or the loss of species, but large&#173;scale destabilization of
landscapes, with major impacts on people living in mountains or
downstream.<BR>
</B>
<P>
<B>Thriving in harsh environments<BR>
</B>
<P>
Most mountains are divided into vegetation belts with specific
temperature and moisture conditions. Overlain on these general
patterns are variations deriving from underlying rocks, the orientation
of slopes, the effects of large&#173; and smallscale disturbances,
and the availability of micro&#173;habitats. Each species occupies
habitats to which it is adapted. Both plants and animals are found
up to 6,000 m in the tropics.<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Fragile ecosystems respond highly sensitive and rapidly
to human intervention. Restoring the original state may take a
very long period of time. An experiment in the Schynige Platte
area of the Swiss Alps in the 1930s shows that the natural plant
community responds to application of fertilizer within 3 and 5
years. Restoring the original plant community may take more than
100 years. In this experiment, all the endangered 'red&#173;list'
species disappeared with the application of fertilizer. Inappropriate
human intervention, here excess Nfertilizer, resulted in a 90%
loss of biodiversity. (O. Hegg)<BR>

<B>Surviving human activities<BR>
</B>
<P>
Continued human intervention is necessary for some species to
survive; such as plants in meadows, where natural herbivores have
been replaced by grazing or mowing over centuries. However, human
activities endanger many mountain ecosystems and species. Wetlands
are particularly vulnerable; through dam construction, drainage,
pollution, and the introduction of alien species. Mountain forests
may be lost or completely changed through clearing for agriculture
and plantations and cutting for timber and fuelwood, and the introduction
of new species. Medicinal and ornamental plants and mushrooms
may be collected to extinction. Quarrying and road construction
can remove the habitat of cliff species. Downhill skiing may disturb
animals and birds, and damage vegetation.<BR>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=5>The risks of climate change<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B>Climate change has significant implications for mountain people
and billions living downstream. Major changes in rainfall and
snowfall patterns, and more extreme events, such as floods and
avalanches, are likely. Governments and many industries &#173;
agriculture, energy, forestry, insurance &#173; are developing
policies for areas in the mountains and lowlands can not assume
that future climates will be similar to recent history. Regarding
risk mitigation and longtermplanning, scenarios of positive and
negative impacts of climate change are needed.<BR>
</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Change Scenario</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>+3.5&#176; C / +10% Precipitation</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>With a 3.5&#176;C increase in annual temperature,
and a 10% increase in precipitation, vegetation belts will move
upwards. Ecological conditions will change and some habitats may
disappear. As many species are trapped in the &quot;islands. of
mountains, they may be endangered if their habitat vanishes. (Patrick
N. Halpin)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B>A complex future<BR>
</B>
<P>
Detailed predictions of future mountain climates are difficult,
due to the complexity of mountain regions and inadequate long&#173;term
data. Likely changes include shifts in major storm tracks and
earlier snowmelt. Changes in runoff are expected to affect the
lowlands, especially dry areas fed by mountain snowmelt. Higher
temperatures and carbon dioxide may result in more productive
agriculture and forestry; but weeds, pests, and diseases may prosper,
and fires may increase. Higher temperatures may reduce permafrost
areas and foster slope processes such as rock falls and landslides.
Disease&#173;carrying organisms may also move upwards. In winter,
changes in the distribution and timing of snowfall and snowmelt
may significantly affect the ski tourism. On the other hand, the
transport sector may benefit from longer snow&#173;free periods.
<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<B>Flexibility for the future<BR>
</B>
<P>
Cooperation and diverse, flexible management systems will be increasingly
important. However, climate change is only one factor to be considered
for sustainable development; its benefits and negative impacts
will interact in complex ways.<BR>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>There is &quot;a discernible human influence on global
climate&quot;: Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 1996.
<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Mountains are sensitive early warning systems for
climate change. Nearly all glaciers, except for some In Norway
and western North America, are retreating. One is the Zongo glacier,
Bolivia (left), which provides water for large areas. The glaciers
of Kilimanjaro (left) have lost more than half of their area since
the 1880s.<BR>

<B><FONT SIZE=5>The diversity of mountain cultures<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<B>Mountain peoples are increasingly integrated into the modern
world. They face many challenges in maintaining their cultural
identity and self&#173;confidence, which are essential for their
proper development. These need to be fostered not only from within,
but also from outside the mountains, particularly from urban centres
and governments.<BR>
<BR>
</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The mountains of western Central Asia are one of
the major centres of linguistic diversity. Other centres of ethnic
diversity include the eastern Caucasus and the Altai. (Source:
H.J. Kreutzmann)<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B>Maintaining identity<BR>
</B>
<P>
While most distinct mountain peoples are relatively few in number,
some large groups exist, such as the Quechua (Andes), Amhars (Ethiopia),
and Tibetans. Some major centres of culture have been in mountains;
others have been areas of refuge for those whose language, religion,
or race differed from those of a region's dominant groups. Many
mountain people have intentionally maintained their cultural identity
by keeping not only a physical, but a socio&#173;cultural, distance
from their neighbours.<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<B>Factors of loss<BR>
</B>
<P>
Modern <B>transport and communication </B>vastly increase the
mobility of people, goods, and ideas. External ideas brought by
returning migrants, tourists, investors, or telecommunications
also lead to losses of cultural diversity. This concerns not only
languages, customs, costumes, or architecture, but also land practices,
crop varieties, cultivation methods and land ownership.<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<B>Mountain societies and economies<BR>
</B>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=5>Working together:</FONT></B>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=5>Mutual aid and common property<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<B>Many tasks required to ensure the continuity of mountain communities
exceed the abilities of individuals and families. Systems of mutual
aid and common property have evolved in concert with fixed and
changing local conditions. They are generally far more appropriate
for sustainable mountain development than regulations and institutional
systems elaborated by central administrations.<BR>
</B>
<P>
<B>Thriving in a fragile environment<BR>
</B>
<P>
While agricultural land is generally privately&#173;owned, its
productive use may only be possible when families work together
to construct and maintain terraces and irrigation systems and,
often, to plant and harvest crops. Joint ownership and management
are also valuable in using forest resources and pastures sustainably.
Such common&#173;property resources are governed by strict rules
defining individual rights and responsibilities. Protecting mountain
communities, access routes, transit corridors and infrastructure
from natural hazards also involves communal tasks, such as constructing
defence structures and planting trees; as well as the knowledgeable
siting of buildings and infrastructure..<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<B>Choosing the right innovations<BR>
</B>
<P>
These communal institutions and systems are based on centuries
of local experience. Today, many are threatened, or have been
lost; through technical progress, increased government influence,
better communication, and economic forces. Not all endeavours
can be implemented locally; for example, large construction projects.
The division of labour and investment between public and private
entities and self&#173;help groups must be carefully defined for
each mountain community and region. Innovations in institutional
structures, technical knowledge, and organizational management
are often necessary to ensure better responses to changing situations,
however, they must be locally suported.<BR>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Terraces as in the Mandara Mountains, Cameroon, are
essential for the cultivation of steep slopes in many mountain
regions. Their construction, as here in the Ethiopian Highlands,
requires the cooperation of whole communities. (Photos: H. Hurni,

<P>
<FONT SIZE=5>Managing and living in the mountain landscape<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
For most mountain inhabitants of developing countries, fields,
grazing land, and forests are their main workplaces and sources
of sustenance. Their way of life is characterized by the complementary
use of different attitudinal zones, whose use is conditioned by
physical factors and infrastructure constructed over generations.
Pressures to intensify the use of these landscapes threaten their
careful management, on which not only mountain people, but millions

<P>
Mountain economies in developing countries are primarily based
on local resources and driven by local needs. Few people are exclusively
,,farmers&quot; or ,,foresters&quot;. Most individuals pursue
myriad activities in an agro&#173;silvo&#173;pastoral system.
The forests provide essential inputs to agriculture, and many
other resources such as animal fodder, timber, non&#173;wood products
for food or income, and fuelwood.<BR>

<P>
<B>Adapting to change?<BR>
</B>
<P>
The vast array of mountain land&#173;use systems reflects diverse
physical and cultural conditions. Today, the rates of change mountain
people are experiencing are too rapid to allow them to evolve
effective adaptive strategies. Larger populations, unsustainable
poverty alleviation policies and desires for higher income lead
to increases in demand, often resulting in soil nutrient depletion,
soil erosion and ultimately lower crop yields. Outmigration can
decrease demand, and is widespread, but often at the expense of
maintaining the land. Upgrading the production base through terracing
or irrigation is often not possible due to lacking man power.
<BR>
<P>
<B>Paths to intensification<BR>
</B>
<P>
Where possible, new ways to intensify the use of entire mountain
landscapes are needed. This will involve among others development
planners, extension agents, and foresters. But they must understand
the complex systems and needs of local people. The introduction
of ecologically and culturally appropriate species or varieties,
combined with suitable production, harvesting, storage and marketing
strategies, may permit increased benefits. However, all long&#173;term
investments also in agriculture and forestry are only possible
when property rights are guaranteed.<BR>
<P>
<B>Agriculture and forestry: pillars of mountain communities<BR>
</B>
<P>
Costs of production in agriculture and forestry are generally
higher in mountains, and transport to markets more expensive.
Nonetheless, due to increasing demands for products, unsatisfied
by the lowlands, intensification in both sectors is occurring.
This often results in more serious environmental costs and long
term impairment of productivity. On the other abandonment of steeplands
is occurring, and forest area is increasing through natural regrowth
or state and private reforestation programs. In some countries
mountain farmers are finding a risk&#173;reduction agriculture
/forestry combination by planting trees on their farms. Community
management of forests as a replacement of failed or inadequate
government control is also improving the picture.<BR>
<P>
<B>Recognizing linkages<BR>
</B>
<P>
High&#173;quality agricultural goods and forest products may increase
competitiveness, particularly when new technologies are used.
Yet such primary activities, alone, are rarely a basis for sustainable
mountain development. Mountain agriculture and forestry should
no longer be treated independently. Mountain people must by compensated
for the inherent disadvantages of their environments and the many
services they provide to wider communities by maintaining mountain
landscapes. This requires the integration of environmental externalities
into agricultural and other sectoral policies, and support for
multi&#173;functional economies. Otherwise, as has begun in many
regions, depopulation will occur, with unpredictable consequences
for all those downstream<BR>

<FONT SIZE=5>Comparative inequalities<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B>Most mountain people have lower standards of living than people
in the neighbouring lowlands. Lower standards of living include
restricted access to education, capital for investments and off&#173;farm
job opportunities. This is not always true in tropical and subtropical
areas, where mountains provide more favourable conditions for
life. Even so, mountain people are typically marginalized through
economic and political factors, which compound the environmental
constraints. Within every mountain region, there are significant
ethnic, generational, and gender inequalities. Sustainable mountain
development implies the reduction of these inequalities; otherwise,
extensive environmental deterioration is likely.<BR>
</B>
<P>
<B>Recognizing women's roles<BR>
</B>
<P>
In the mountain societies of developing countries, women are responsible
for most of the farming, and the nurturing of future generations.
Their importance is not reflected in their access to education,
social services, credit, land and other assets, and technologies.
These disparities begin in childhood, and continue through their
lives. Women occupy a disproportionate number of low&#173;paid
and labour&#173;intensive jobs; cannot obtain credit even when
they are the main food producers; and rarely have major decision&#173;making
roles outside their families, or benefit equitably from inheritance.
A central focus of mountain development plans should be to decrease
these inequities, aiming at gender&#173;balanced development.
This will require a strong continuation of the initiated shift
in the policies and actions of aid agencies, which have often
further weakened the status of women.<BR>

<B>Mountains are often regarded as barriers to communication.
Yet most are traversed by important trade routes, often with major
trading centres for products from the mountains and the adjacent
plains. The opening of ways into and through the mountains has
largely been driven by the demands of lowland economies and political
realities. Examples are the export of minerals, wood, or animals;
the transit of goods; access for tourism, and strategic control!
along national frontiers, important transit roads and passes.

Mountain inhabitants may gain opportunities for employment, both

draw resources and people from adjacent valleys, causing environmental
and societal change. Major transit routes mainly benefit those
outside the mountains. However, people living close to these routes
suffer negative impacts, such as noise and air pollution.  Construction
of mountain roads may also change surface runoff and threaten

<B>The decline of the production potential<BR>
</B>
<P>
Industrial and agricultural goods from mountain regions rarely
have absolute cost advantages because of high production and transport
costs, so that imported goods are&#173;cheaper. When goods are
produced in the mountains at a cost disadvantage in an attempt
to compete, mountain workers receive lower salaries than equally
qualified workers in neighbouring lowlands. With lower incomes,
mountain people have lower savings; and imported goods are expensive
In relation to Income. The lack of savings tends to limit investments
in agriculture and other sectors, leading to stagnating or declining
economies with a low added value. Consequently, mountain areas
are likely to remain agrarian. This will further disadvantage
them as, following global trade liberalization, agricultural prices
tend to decline even more relatively.<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<B>The need of government action<BR>
</B>
<P>
In the absence of government intentention, trade liberalization
is likely to hit areas most with high employment in agriculture,
which suffer in many cases from high population growth and limited
opportunities for migration; this, leading to a stronger reliance
on food imports. Conversely, mountain areas with low population
growth and multi&#173;sectoral economies should be affected less.
Nevertheless, many governments will have to develop appropriate
policies to maintain the region's production potential.<BR>

<P>
<B>A particularly high proportion of wars and conflicts take place
in mountain regions, usually because of interactions with lowland
areas. As mountain communities have limited means to cope with
environmental challenges, their relations to the lowlands may
rapidly precipitate into crisis when the socio&#173;ecological
balance is disturbed. Sustainable mountain development is a vital
means for preventing and managing conflict.<BR>
</B>
<P>
<B>Sources of tension<BR>
</B>
<P>
Although difficult to access, mountain regions have always inter&#173;related
with neighbouring foothills and plains, whether ecologically,
through the water cycle; or socio&#173;economically: transhumance,
providing labour, and offering transportation routes. Environmental
change and the shortage of resources &#173; such as fertile land,
water, forests &#173; are deepening poverty, widening social divides,
disrupting migration patterns, and causing new population movements.
Long&#173;established social and political structures are being
challenged. Consequences include international disputes over water
resources and, within States, growing tensions along societal
boundaries such as classes, or ethnic and tribal groups: the main
causes of many, if not most, internal wars.<BR>
<P>
<B>Avoiding stresses<BR>
</B>
<P>
Where ecology is fragile, social peace is also fragile, and resources
must be shared equitably to avoid conflict. The management of
mountain conflicts should focus on the economic and environmental
roots of multiple stress on highland&#173;lowland interactions.
Participatory approaches, coupled with adapting established regulations
of access to resources to new conditions, are most likely to produce
sustainable and realistic solutions.<BR>

</B>
<P>
Mountains have higher precipitation than surrounding lowlands.
Much of this precipitation falls as snow, which is released as
meltwater in spring and summer. This is particularly important
when the rivers reach to semi&#173;arid and arid regions with
high evaporation rates and demands for irrigation water in summer.
All of the world's largest rivers originate in the mountains.
<BR>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Planning of reselvoils must consider all aspects
of dynamic mountain environments. Sedimentation rates in the Kulekhani
reservoir, Nepal, built to provide hydro&#173;electnc power for

of its capacity were lost in the first 13 years of operanon, three&#173;quarters
of this in 1993, when 500 mm precipitation fell in a single storm
of 24 hours.<BR>

Water in lakes, rivers, and reservoirs is not only available for
consumption, but provides a major source of energy. For instance,
the hydropower potential of the Brahmaputra, Ganges, and Indus,

management of water resources requires adequate information and
knowledge, which is generally lacking. The hydrological observation
networks in mountains worldwide are in decline (WMO).<BR>

136 km3 of water are stored in lakes and reservoirs, such as the

<P>
<B>Driven by the growth of global consumption, modern technology
&#173;for mineral exploration and extraction, and the construction
of infrastructure &#173; has made the most remote mountain areas
accessible and profitable for mining. Agenda 21 calls on national
governments and multinational mining companies to 'pray a major
role in reducing Impacts on resource use and the environment'.
This includes responsibility to minimize the social and cultural
effects of mining.<BR>
</B>
<P>
<B>Mining at the limits<BR>
</B>
<P>
Many mines are located at high altitudes with harsh climates and
natural hazards. These pose significant risks to long, circuitous
access roads, bridges, infrastructure and camps. Present mining
is challenged by avoiding air pollution, the failure of tailings,
and percolation of toxic mine drainage. Many of these problems
remain after mining has finished, and rehabilitation of mining
sites is often very difficult. High altitudes also mean that labour
&#173; mechanical power and human effort &#173; is significantly
reduced; for instance, the oxygen concentration at 5000 m is only
half that at sea level.<BR>
<P>
<B>Limited local benefits<BR>
</B>
<P>
Mining in remote areas may result in severe social disintegration
and changes of local economies. Almost everything &#173;fuel,
food, timber, machinery&#173; is imported. Often, the labour force
must also be imported, resulting in ethnic enclaves in culturally
different environments. Some miners work long shifts for a few
days, weeks or even months, and are sometimes hundreds of kilometers
away from their families.<BR>

<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<B>After millenia of human modification of the Earth's ecosystems,
mountain areas are refuges for a great wealth of endemic species,
specialized ecosystems, and remarkable landscapes. A common approach
to conserving this biological and landscape diversity has been
to establish national parks, nature reserves, and other protected
areas. More recent approaches recognise that biological and landscope
diversity must also be conserved on land under human&#173;use
regimes of agriculture and forestry, and that the private sector
can be a major conserver of these values.<BR>
</B>
<P>
<B>Biodiversity richness<BR>
</B>
<P>
Tropical mountains include major centres of global biodiversity;
other important centres are found in arid subtropical mountains.
The high biodiversity is to a large extent due to the different
climatic attitudinal belts, the different conditions on different
sides of the mountain and the many microhabitats. Isolated mountains
(such as Kilimanjaro) also result in a high proportion of endemic
species.<BR>
<P>
<B>Mountain protected areas<BR>
</B>
<P>
Many of the mountain areas of greatest biological and landscape
diversity are protected areas, often with additional international
status: 39 World Heritage Sites and 141 Biosphere Reserves. Such
areas can protect endemic and threatened species, offer recreation
and tourism opportunities, and be used to monitor environmental
changes. These functions are best achieved when protected areas
also provide regional or transboundary mechanisms for cooperation.
This is especially critical in mountain areas, where administrative
boundaries divide ecosystems. People, wildlife, fires, diseases,
air pollution regularly cross administrative and ecological boundaries.
<BR>
<P>

<B>Joint management<BR>
</B>
<P>
Recent conservation approaches stress the linkages between biological
and cultural diversity. Many mountain areas which are now legally
protected have long been used e.g. for collecting plants and forest
products, religious ceremonies, and grazing. Prohibiting these
uses, or recreation, is not practicable or desirable. On the contrary,
implementing and monitoring regional conservation policies jointly
with local and other stakeholders should be emphasized. Outside
of protected areas, needs to provide grazing for wild animals,
or corridors for migration, may influence the management and use
of certain areas, in buffer zones of conservation.<BR>

Most mountain protected areas were established to protect isolated
areas, usually only at high elevations above the agriculture and

of nature protection are inadequate for long&#173;term conservation
of biological diversity; especially if appropriate habitat for
important species shrinks because of climate change. Animals and
plants must have opportunities to migrate not only up and down,
but also along and between mountain ranges. This requires migration
corridors between isolated habitats and solitary protected areas.

Tourism provides a vast range of ,,products&quot; to millions

region and, although often highly seasonal, dominates the economy
of many of them. Often, far wider areas than tourists visit are
affected. Tourism often leads to substantial tensions and inequities,
for instance, between those employed in traditional economic activities
and those with high&#173;paying tourist jobs, or because prices
for housing, goods and infrastructure increase.<BR>
<P>
<B>Balancing benefits and costs<BR>
</B>
<P>
While the diversity of landscapes, opportunities for sports, and
,,living cultural resources&quot; attract people to mountains,
tourism almost inevitably changes these attractants. It can stimulate
sustainable mountain development: through employment, the production
of food and handicrafts, or transfer payments from communities
which benefit directly from tourist income to those which maintain
the landscape &#173; the ,,capital&quot; of tourism. The potential
environmental impacts may provide opportunities to develop and
test new technologies and strategies: for water and waste treatment,
energy production and utilisation, or food production.<BR>

<B>Ensuring compatibility<BR>
</B>
<P>
Tourism is never free&#173;standing, and is introduced into communities
with existing cultural norms and economic activities. The infrastructure
constructed in a landscape is often used for many other purposes.
Therefore, development of policies and plans must be based on
a realistic assessment of the relative social and environmental
compatibilities of different tourist and other economic activities,
and involve local communities and other stakeholders at all stages
from initial definition to implementation.

know&#173;how, behaviour, and customs to their children. This
role is further enhanced when, as often, men are absent for many
months, as economic migrants.<BR>

<B>Investments in a time of change<BR>
</B>
<P>
Local knowledge and experience are keys to sustaining ecosystems,
livelihood, and production. However, they must be cautiously integrated
with new techniques and research findings. This requires a focus
on practical training and education, if possible on&#173;site
in the mountains. This will be costly, given the sparse distribution
and isolation of many mountain populations. Governments must be
ready to make proportionately greater investments for training
and education in mountain regions, and support their communities
in maintaining and transmitting to their children their local
languages, knowledge, and culture.<BR>

&#173; The Hindu&#173;Kush&#173;Himalayan Region is the world's
highest mountain region, and extending over 3500km from Afghanistan
in the west to Myanmar in the east, encompassing 8 countries.
Collecting information and developing a digital database for the
whole region are a major function of ICIMOD's information system
MENRIS. All information is procured from official government sources
and through interpretation of satellite images, combined in a
comprehensive GIS database at a scale of 1:250,000.<BR>
<P>
- In the Alpine countries there is also a growing need for sharing
information. Since eight countries and the European Union are
involved, such information systems are decentralized, but well
coordinated and open to all types of users. An Alpine Convention
is further promoting coperation among these nations.<BR>

<B>Research and pilot projects for community development<BR>

<P>
Too often we find mountain projects without the necessary scientific
base. Expensive maintenance or even the destruction of roads,
irrigation canals, small power plants, etc. could be avoided if
only a fewpercentsof the costs were spent for a careful scientific
study of the location and the local hazardous processes beforehand.
<P>
Many mountain&#173;specific problems require scientific work:
E.g. natural hazards and changing environmental conditions, nature
conservation and sustainable resource use, economic marginalisation
and possible mechanisms for the compensation of disadvantages,
regional development planning and its impact at the community
level, etc. Interdisciplinary approaches are fundamental and the
involvement of local men and women strengthens human resource
development and capacity&#173;building, even on a community level.
<P>
Chapter 13 demands pilot projects in the framework of integrated
watershed development programmer. Networks for such pilot projects
in different countries of a regional mountain system, executed
with comparable objectives, methods, and techniques, lead not
only to broader knowledge, but also to scientific co&#173;operation,
which is important for a free flow of information across borders.
<BR>
<P>
<B>From local science to a global mountain research network<BR>
</B>
<P>
Mountain research reaches far back into the last centuries. The
main topic was fascination with nature, its processes and its
dangers. Whereas glacial advances or retreats were still considered
an act of God in past centuries, they have now become an important
indicator of climatic oscillations or even climate change.
<P>
Knowing that mountain ecosystems are the most sensitive indicators
of climate and global change, we need a mountain research network
with monitoring stations, not only in the industrialized countries,
but especially in the most vulnerable tropical mountain systems.
 This is not a <FONT SIZE=2>wish of an ivory tower science, it
is much more an urgent need to understand and if possible to predict
potential changes: E.g. for water and energy supply, biodiversity
resources, risks of erosion and natural hazards, and especially
also for the living conditions of the local population like agriculture,
tourism, traffic, etc.<BR>

are principally responsible for environmental degradation in the

<P>
<B>Instruments for sustainable mountain development<BR>
</B>
<P>
The State's essential role stems from its political function and
financial power. It has to define, through means as participatory
as possible, a normative framework and a general policy for sustainable
mountain development; implement this policy; control its application;
evaluate its results; and play the role of arbiter. To execute
these tasks, many tools with an enormous influence on the future
of mountain regions are available. Legal instruments include sectoral,
integrated, and regional development policies; and the definition
and protection of property rights. Economic and financial instruments
include investment in infrastructure and other projects; direct
financial support (subsidies, compensation, incentives through
grants and loans); adapted taxation policies; fair pricing; and
financial equalization schemes.<BR>

</FONT>
<P>
<B>Many goods produced by mountain communities &#173; timber,
fuelwood, high quality water, agricultural products, minerals
&#173; have measurable economic value. Through managing local
resources, mountain people also provide other goods and services
whose value is not easily measured in monetary terms, although
their lack can: for instance, the damage caused by floods, ill&#173;health
from polluted water; or the loss of species. However, there are
no free goods: the provision of all goods and services has certain
costs, whether compensated or hidden.<BR>
</B>
<P>
<B>Setting values for stewardship<BR>
</B>
<P>
As internal and external pressures mount, mountain people are
often forced to deplete resources of regional, national, and global
significance for short&#173;term economic gain. If they are to
be adequately compensated for ensuring the long&#173;term provision
of goods and services to wider communities, these goods and services
must first be identified and valued. Various fees and taxes can
then be used to enable mountain people to capture a greater proportion
of this value. To be effective, fees and taxes must be set at
an appropriate level, accurately reflecting the costs of maintaining
and protecting a particular resource. The revenue must be equitably
distributed among the concerned community, providing incentives
to continue their stewardship role.<BR>

<B>Mountain communities face many challenges to competing in the

the diversity of mountain environments and cultures, and physical
constraints permitting the production of specific goods, provide
potential comparative advantage and opportunities to strengthen
mountain economies and communities.<BR>

Comparative advantages of mountain environments and cultures include:
highquality goods, particularly foodstuffs and handicrafts, often
produced in limited areas; local transformation of raw material;
and small&#173;scale systems which are economically and ecologically
preferable to large&#173;scale systems. Even in a global economy,
mountain communities can benefit from ,,geographical indications&quot;
or ,,regional trademarks&quot; &#173; exclusive rights to the

<FONT SIZE=5>Decentralization, empowerment, and capacity building
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B>The decentralization of power &#173; from capital cities to
mountain regions, towns, and villages &#173; can be one of the
best ways to empower mountain inhabitants, reduce costs, and increase
efficiency. Empowerment includes secure property rights; access
to financial resources, markets, information, training, and equitable
participation in political decision&#173;making. Unless mountain
communities are empowered, they will increasingly be unable to
act as the stewards of mountain resources</B>.<BR>
<P>
<B>Sharing responsibility<BR>
</B>
<P>
NGOs and organizations for mutual aid are effective, but only
reach a small proportion of those living in poverty. They must
therefore be part of wider strategies for sustainable mountain
development, with a reasonable distribution of responsibilities
between governments, public agencies, and scientific, multilateral,
community, and private organizations. Subsidiarityshould be a
guiding principle, with public structures responsible only for
tasks that cannot be satisfactorily devolved. State involvement
is often necessary in defining property rights. When these are
secure, owners &#173; private individuals or community groups
&#173; have far greater incentives to manage resources sustainably.
<BR>
<P>
<B>Training and education<BR>
</B>
<P>
The decentralized implementation of action programmes and development
plans requires reliable institutions with strong leaders. Mountain
decision&#173;makers must be thoroughly trained in participatory
approaches, management, and planning. Yet, for most mountain people,
access to training, especially high&#173;level training, is costly
and difficult.. Consequently, policies for sustainable mountain
development should offer mountain people opportunities and financial
means for training and education equivalent to those accessible
to people in lowland and urban areas. Such training fosters the
use of local experts, rather than expensive consultants.<BR>
<P>
<B>Access to knowledge and information<BR>
</B>
<P>
To define appropriate strategies for sustainable mountain development,
all stakeholders must understand and support what is being done.
However, access to relevant knowledge and information is often
limited to governmental and academic institutions, with minimal
or no flow to other agencies, NGOs, or local communities and institutions.
Stakeholders also need information to monitor and evaluate these
strategies; particularly criteria and indicators of environmental
and societal change which can be applied reliably, rapidly, and
economically.<BR>

<B>Identifying issues and solutions<BR>
</B>
<P>
Chapter 13 of ,,Agenda 21&quot; has been an important catalyst
to governmental consideration of sustainable mountain development
around the world. In the five years since the Rio ,,Earth Summit&quot;,
various regional initiatives have started or been strengthened.
Under the auspices of FAO, Task Manager for Chapter 13, regional
inter&#173;governmental consultations have taken place for Africa,
Asia/Pacific, Europe, and Latin America, involving representatives
of 62 governments. These consultations have identified major issues
and existing initiatives for sustainable mountain developments
and stimulated national mountain policies.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<B>Mechanisms for regional cooperation<BR>
</B>
<P>
The most formal mechanism for regional cooperation is a convention.
Only one convention for a mountain chain exists to date: the Alpine
Convention, which entered into force in 1995. In theJura, Pyrenees,
and the western, central, and eastern Alps, regional governments
have established ,,Working Communities&quot; which provide mechanisms
for cooperation and harmonization of policies and research.<BR>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=5>Global organizations and initiatives<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B>Global organizations have major roles to play in sustainable
mountain development. Trends in international trade and multilateral
funding are of central importance in defining future development
paths, and complementarities between global initiatives should
be encouraged.<BR>
</B>
<P>
<B>The role of international trade<BR>
</B>
<P>
Despite attempts to integrate social and environmental factors
into measures of development, it is still largely defined in economic
terms. The World Trade Organization &#173; and the wider context
of trade liberalization, globalization, and privatization &#173;
are critical factors. Yet, as long as short&#173;term benefits
outweigh longterm impacts, market policies and practices generally
work against the interest of poorer countries and marginalized
re&quot;ions, such as mountain areas. Growth should be sustainable;
and the distribution of its benefits &#173; and structural adjustments
&#173; should also serve poor people.<BR>
<P>
<B>Recognizing linkages<BR>
</B>
<P>
Each chapter of ,,Agenda 21&quot; has been implemented separately.
Yet many are cross&#173;sectoral, and there are clear linkages
between thematic chapters. Sustainable mountain development cannot
be
<P>
sectoral, and the UN Commission for Sustainable Development (CSD)
should foster the integration of actions taken under individual
chapters. The Global Environment Facility (GEF) may be an important
mechanism for financing such integrated projects.<BR>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>To assure the competitiveness of mountain production,
action is needed at international, national, and local levels,

At the first meeting of the ad hoc interagency group for follow&#173;up
to Chapter 13, in 1994, NGOs were accepted as full partners. In
1995, 1 10 representatives of mountain NGOs, governments, and
international agencies met in Lima, Peru. They established 'The
Mountain Forum', for mutual support and the exchange of experiences
between all actors &#173; organizations and individuals &#173;
concerned with sustainable mountain development. Currently facilitated
by 'The Mountain Institute' (Virginia, USA), it has a decentralized
structure, with regional focal points &#173; so far, in the Asia/Pacific
and Latin American regions &#173; coordinating networking activities.
There is much room for expansion, for instance through involving
other networks, such as mountaineering and business associations,
and the private sector in general.<BR>

<P>
<B>Investing in mountains<BR>
</B>
<P>
During summer 1996, over 200 people from 23 countries participated
in a Mountain Forum electronic conference: ,,Investing in Mountains&quot;.
They identified many innovative mechanisms for financing sustainable
mountain development. These often involve the private sector;
industries which rely on mountain resources but are based in lowland
areas could play a far greater role. As well as paying compensation
for using resources, companies can adopt or sponsor mountain communities
or institutions. Other private local initiatives include twinning
of communities, and support from tourism companies for conservation
projects and water, education, health facilities.<BR>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>A survey of 1,000 NGOs concerned with European mountain
areas showed a strong belief that local people and organizations
and NGOs are key actors for a sustainable future. These results
were discussed by over 100 participants. from 24 countries, at

<B>Chapter 13 of ,,Agenda 21&quot; was prepared in a short time,
with little input from NGOs and mountain inhabitants. But follow&#173;up
and review procedures have involved a very wide range of concerned
actors. The inter&#173;governmental and non&#173;governmental
consultations, and other activities, have increased recognition
of the distinct qualities of mountain areas and their need for
special attention, and produced important new ideas and recommendations.

<P>
<B>Continuing the implementation<BR>
</B>
<P>
Implementation of Chapter 13 has followed a unique path, including
diverse initiatives at many levels, sometimes coordinated, sometimes
not. The common thread is the commitment of all actors to sustainable
mountain development. This approach is less organised and less
hierarchical than for many other chapters of ,,Agenda 21&quot;,
but it is full of vitality and corresponds to the diversity of
mountain regions. This multi&#173;faceted approach must be maintained.

Thanks to several UN&#173;organisations, such as UNESCO, UNU,

such as CIP, ICIMOD, ICRAF, IUCN, TMI, etc.<BR>
<P>
The UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) has been carrying
out the Task Manager role for Chapter 13. The overall objective
is to ensure collaboration and cooperation in the follow up to,
including reporting on, the implementation of Agenda 21 by the
United Nations system. Major responsibilities as Task Manager
include reporting on implementation; strengthening information
exchange; promoting interagency consultation; catalysing joint
activities and programmer; and developing common strategies.<BR>

<B>A new perception of the Mountain World<BR>
</B>
<P>
Mountains and Highlands are extremely complex both biophysically
and culturally. Their three&#173;dimensional character, world&#173;wide
occurrence, and political fragmentation, together with their significant
area and population (approximately 25 percent of the world's land
area and 10 percent of total human population),
<P>
demonstrates their centrality in terms of the prospects for a
secure, humane, and prosperous world society. So far, while acquiring
some lip&#173;service after the Rio Earth Summit in 1992, these
&quot;mountain imperatives&quot; have not been incorporated into
the new approaches to sustainable development, the global market,
nor world environmental policy. The recent development of world
trade liberalization and a free&#173;market economy actually accentuate
the competitive disadvantage of the mountain regions.<BR>
<P>
<B>A Revolution in Political Behavior<BR>
</B>
<P>
Mountains and Highlands, as marginal and marginalised regions,
throughout the ages and increasingly toward the end of our millennium,
have usually incurred exploitation by the power centres of the
economically and politically better integrated lowlands. This
has taken the form of damaging, and often ruthless, extraction
of natural resources that has resulted in further marginalisation
of mountain peoples and their comparative neglect during times
of natural and man&#173;made countries, the past 50&#173;year
record of bilateral and multilateral &quot;aid&quot; and &quot;assistance&quot;
is characterised by top&#173;down imposition of &quot;solutions&quot;
from outside the mountains. Some of the results of this, despite
many real advances, have been the loss of self&#173;esteem, disregard
of centuries of accumulated traditional understanding of how to
live in difficult and fragile environments, and collapse, or severe
modification of mountain cultures.<BR>
<P>
Even though this situation is in process of being reversed, especially
since Rio, such progress is being overwhelmed by the growing impacts
of warfare in its many forms. The majority of on&#173;going and
recent armed conflicts in the world impact mountain peoples and
mountain lands out of all proportion to their total numbers and
land area. The so&#173;called &quot;drug war&quot; is merely an
extension of this shame of armed conflict that disproportionately
devastates mountain peoples. The massive displacement of anywhere
from 15 to 30 million refugees across international borders, very
often in mountainous regions, adds to the alarming spread of malnutrition
and disease.<BR>
<P>
In this instance, a revolution in political behaviour is imperative:
within the UN and amongst the so&#173;called rich nations who
claim to provide leadership for world peace. A failure to achieve
a virtual world revolution &#173; a real new world order &#173;
will purchase an enormous penalty, for any collapse of mountain
cultures and their environments and resources will have inexorable
downstream<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<B>Human and Natural Resources for the next century<BR>
</B>
<P>
Sustainable mountain development can proceed if based upon rational
approaches, reduction in unbalanced highlandlowland competitiveness,
and recognition that mountain people are equal in terms of their
humanity and genetically and socially derived abilities. The recent
progress toward local and regional autonomy, at least in some
areas, must be accelerated. Advances in science and technology
must be blended with traditional mountain expertise and experience.
Above all, there must be direct and indirect reciprocity for good
mountain environmental stewardship. Many examples are available
that can be useful in this respect, included direct return payment
for export of mountain water, generation of electricity, minerals
and forest products. But to this must be added compensation for
good agro&#173;pastoral and forestry management as one of the
best forms of upper watershed protection, preservation of biological
diversity and of an aesthetically pleasing landscape and culture
for the increasing numbers of tourists in a rapidly growing urban
world. Above all, the gender, generational, and overall highland&#173;lowland
inequalities must be reduced.<BR>
<P>
Success will require development of a much better understanding
of why mountains and mountain peoples offer particular imperatives
and how to assist in development of their tangible and intangible
resources while avoiding cultural and environmental decline. This
will depend upon an enlarged and targeted programme of mountain
policy, participatory research, heightened awareness, inter&#173;regional
mountain communication and collaboration.<BR>

<CENTER>                   I.  KEY OBJECTIVES</CENTER><P>

1.    This report focuses on a limited number of key objectives of
chapter 13 of Agenda 21, including those which are considered the
most relevant in the post-UNCED context and which have been
identified as "priority concerns" in chapter 13 follow-up. These
objectives are related to Programme Area A: Generating and
strengthening knowledge about the ecology and sustainable
development of mountain ecosystems; and Programme Area B:
Promoting integrated watershed development and alternative
livelihood opportunities. The two areas are often dealt with
together in the framework of an integrated ecosystems approach to
sustainable mountain development.  However, key objectives dealt
with in this report go beyond those identified in these two
programme areas of chapter 13 and include new themes which have
come to light more recently.<P>

2.    More specifically, chapter 13 focuses mainly on the
following objectives:<P>

      (a) Raising awareness of the importance of and improving
understanding of sustainable mountain development issues at
global, regional and national levels;<BR>
      (b) Protecting natural resources and developing technical
and institutional arrangements for natural disaster reduction;<BR>
      (c) Strengthening a global information network and database
for organizations, governments and individuals concerned with
mountain issues;<BR>
      (d) Strengthening country capacity to improve planning,
implementation and monitoring of sustainable mountain development
programmes and activities;<BR>
      (e) Combating poverty through the promotion of sustainable
income-generating activities and improvement of infrastructure and
social services, in particular to protect the livelihood of local
communities and indigenous people; and <BR>
      (f) Formulating and negotiating regional or sub-regional
mountain conventions and possibly developing a global mountain
charter.<P>


                          <CENTER>      II. SUCCESSES</CENTER><p>


3.      As thinking about sustainable mountain development has
evolved over the five years since Rio, the issues raised in
chapter 13 (which is often referred to as the "Mountain Agenda")
have expanded beyond the original themes of the chapter to
include, for example, new emphasis on conservation, culture,
sacred values and landscape diversity. The element of spirituality
surrounding mountains and the often special relationship between
mountain peoples and the land they live on and care for has gained
greater recognition over recent years and has become an essential
driving force in the movement to conserve mountain environments
and cultures. Recently, especially in Africa, the contribution of
mountain ranges to water resource flows, and more specifically in
the chain linking water to food security, has been highlighted.
There is also increasing recognition of the importance of mountain
areas in terms of biodiversity conservation, economic potential
and protection of downstream interests. This has led to a greater
willingness to address development and conservation needs through
investment programmes in areas that have traditionally been
neglected in national level development planning.<p>

4.  Progress has been made in creating greater awareness of the
"Mountain Agenda" and improving coordination of efforts to protect
fragile mountain ecosystems and promote sustainable mountain
development. This has been achieved largely as a result of the
international and regional intergovernmental and non-governmental
organization (NGO) consultations which have provided focus on key
mountain issues and led to recommendations relevant at both global
and regional levels. Regional intergovernmental consultations have
been held for Asia (1994), Latin America (1995), Europe (two
sessions, 1996) and Africa (1996); a regional NGO consultation was
also held for Europe (1996). Other important meetings include the
International NGO Consultation on the Mountain Agenda held in
Lima, Peru in February 1995, and other regional, sub-regional and
national initiatives such as the Second International Symposium on
"Sustainable Mountain Development: Managing Fragile Ecosystems in
the Andes" (Bolivia, 1995); the International Symposium
"Karakorum-Hindukush-Himalaya: Dynamics of Change" (Pakistan,
1995); the International Symposium on Agricultural Development in
Mountain and Hill Areas (China, 1996); Rwenzori mountains
conference (Uganda, 1996); and the International Conference on
"Ecohydrology of High Mountain Areas" (Nepal, 1996). In addition,
awareness of the importance of transboundary cooperation in
mountain protected areas has been increased as a result of the
Transboundary Mountain Protected Area Workshop held in Australia
in 1995.<p>


5.  New institutional arrangements at global and regional level
have also contributed to progress in achieving and improving
communications networking and in providing an information
clearing-house function. This has been achieved in part through
the creation in 1995 of the Mountain Forum, a network of
organizations and institutions with a shared interest in
sustainable mountain development. With major financial support
provided by the Swiss Government, the Mountain Forum operates
primarily as a decentralized structure with regional focal points
established to coordinate networking activities. The Consortium
for the Sustainable Development of the Andean Ecoregion (CONDESAN)
convened by the International Potato Center (CIP), a member of the
Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR),
has been selected as the focal point for Latin America and the
Caribbean. The International Centre for Integrated Mountain
Development (ICIMOD) is coordinating networking in Asia and the
Pacific, both at the regional level, through the Asia Pacific
Mountain Network, and at the sub-regional level since
establishment of the North and Central Asia Mountain Network.
Together with The Mountain Institute, these organizations make up
the Mountain Forum's Interim Facilitating Committee, which has
been set up at the global level with the specific purpose of
assisting in building the network.  Regional networks are also
being established in Europe and Africa, mainly through NGO
efforts. The Mountain Forum is one of several innovative
partnerships and alliances being studied under the Global
Excellence in Management (GEM) Initiative by Case Western Reserve
University in the United States. Documenting the way in which the
Mountain Forum is expanding capacity beyond its own organizational
boundaries is expected to be an important outcome of the study.
Another important example of new regional cooperation is the
Asociacio'n de Montan~as Andinas, whose main objective is to
contribute to implementation of Chapter 13 in the Andes.<P>

                     <CENTER>       III.  PROMISING CHANGES</CENTER><P>

10.   New forms of partnership are coming about as a result of
increased collaboration and interaction between the public and
private sectors in which governments, non-governmental and
intergovernmental organizations have found common ground and
engaged in constructive dialogue. There has been a concerted and
participatory effort, particularly over the past three years, to
amplify the original aims and objectives of Chapter 13 by forging
consensus on priorities, and identifying the differing strengths
and capacities of public, private and NGO sectors to contribute to
implementation.  In addition, there has been greater emphasis on
including local populations and community groups in identifying
and planning mountain development activities.  New partnerships
are also being realized between mountain research and development
interests. International research institutes such as CIP, ICIMOD,
the International Centre for Research in Agroforestry (ICRAF) (in
particular through the African Highlands Initiative), and the
joint United Nations University (UNU)/International Mountain
Society (IMS) project, which have either a specific mountain focus
or include strong mountain research programmes, have been active
members of the interagency network on mountains. This has served
to strengthen the linkages and interaction between mountain
research and development interests. Organizations including the
World Conservation Union (IUCN), the International Center for
Alpine Environments (ICALPE) and the International Livestock
Research Institute (ILRI) have increased their involvement in
mountain conservation and development, and developed new
partnerships through their roles in planning and implementing the
regional intergovernmental consultations in Europe and Africa. <P>

11.   Although there are still relatively few activities which
have been initiated directly as a result of Chapter 13, the
willingness of most regions of the world to engage in
intergovernmental and non-governmental consultations on the topic
of sustainable mountain development has been an important step in
implementation since UNCED. This process has allowed for clearer
definition of the challenges facing each region and possible
responses to them, and a stronger sense of involvement and
commitment on the part of governments and other concerned
stakeholders as the discussion has focused on issues of greater
direct relevance at the regional and national level.  This
consultation process has been carried out over a relatively short
period, only having begun in late 1994, with the majority of
meetings having taken place during 1996.  Although so far there
has been insufficient interest by governments of North America to
hold an intergovernmental consultation there, an NGO-organized
meeting to which governments would also be invited, is currently
under discussion.  As a result of these regional meetings, greater
activity is expected at national and regional levels in terms of
specific mountain development and conservation programmes and
reinforced institutional arrangements. Regional networks, in
addition to those in Asia and Latin America, are also being
established in Europe and Africa, following the consultations held
in 1996. In accordance with the recommendations of the third
session of the Commission on Sustainable Development (CSD), upon
completion of the regional consultations a wider international
meeting on sustainable mountain development is expected to be
held. Several governments have already expressed their support for
holding such a meeting, the objectives of which, however, would
need to be clearly defined and perceived as timely and relevant to
on-going implemenation to the countries and organizations involved .<P>

12.   The maintainance and generation of database and information
systems to facilitate the integrated management and environmental
assessment of mountain ecosystems has seen little progress to
date,  however this is expected to change in the near future given
the new and evolving institutional arrangements and new
technologies becoming available for this type of work. In the area
of conventional dissemination of scientific and developmental
information on mountains, the quarterly journal Mountain Research
and Development, co-published by UNU and IMS, continues as the
only scholarly publication of its kind world-wide. <P>

13.   Improvements to the ecological knowledge base regarding
technologies and agricultural and conservation practices in the
mountain regions of the world have been slow but recently
increasing. Most conservation and development programmes in
mountain areas now contain specific components aimed at improving
databases on biological resources. On the other hand, economic,
sociological and cultural information are still largely
unavailable. Greater emphasis is being placed on the importance of
understanding and promoting appropriate indigenous and locally
adapted technologies.  <P>

14.   Transnational cooperation has also been improving. There is
an increased willingness to work across national borders marked by
mountain chains, in particular, for scientific reasons such as to
study the behaviour of migratory species, for environmental
conservation purposes, and for ecological/economic reasons among
countries sharing major water courses. Transborder collaboration
among biosphere reserves is a new emerging topic in UNESCO's
"Programme on Man and the Biosphere", in particular in Eastern and
Central Europe. There is also a need for greater cooperation among
countries sharing water resources, especially in many regions of
the world where there is growing demand for water.  <P>

15.   Work has progressed on the better understanding and
dissemination of information regarding environmental risks and
natural disasters in mountain ecosystems. At the twentieth session
of the FAO/European Forestry Commission Working Party on the
Management of Mountain Watersheds, held in Lillehammer, Norway in
July 1996, the topic of mitigation of natural disasters in
mountain areas received significant attention, both in the
European and global context. This topic was also dealt with in
depth at the June 1996 meeting of  INTERPRAEVENT, a group of
European experts meeting in Garmisch, Germany to discuss
cooperation in research, technology transfer, planning and
development relating to natural resources management in mountain
areas, where protection of alpine areas against natural disasters
(e.g. floods, avalanches and mudflows) was discussed at length.
ICIMOD has also been very active in this field and has recently
launched a training programme for mountain risk engineering in the
Himalayas. Also, the IUFRO Working Group on Natural Disasters
plans to hold a meeting in the framework of the 11th World
Forestry Congress (Antalya, Turkey, 13-22 October 1997). The
meeting will consider, inter alia, hazard prevention measures in
mountain regions. This cross-cutting issue is expected to receive
increasing attention in the near future as a result of greater
awareness created through international initiatives, such as the
1994 World Conference on Natural Disaster Reduction, and new and
on-going efforts by international  bodies such as those mentioned
above.  <P>

16.   Perhaps most importantly, and underlying most other factors
which have contributed to the relatively successful implementation
of Chapter 13, is the notion of commitment.  Many of those who
advocate the sustainable development and conservation of mountain
regions and peoples speak with conviction and deep emotional
commitment to many of the causes espoused by the mountain chapter.
The various stakeholders working on mountain related issues, be
they from local communities, NGOs, governments, or international
organizations, often share a common view of the importance and
uniqueness of mountain areas and cultures and carry out their work
with a strong sense of dedication. Their conviction, and the
partnerships that were forged prior to Rio, were instrumental in
gaining chapter status for mountains under Agenda 21 and in
maintaining close collaboration throughout the post-Rio period.<P>

                      <CENTER>   IV.  UNFULFILLED EXPECTATIONS</CENTER>

17.   Several objectives of Chapter 13 remain unfulfilled, or have
seen little or no progress towards implementation. These include:<P>

(a)   Survey work <P>

18.   Adequate progress has still to be made in undertaking
integrated survey work of the different natural resources and
their use in mountain ecosystems and carrying out related
activities needed to strengthen knowledge about the ecology of
mountain ecosystems.  Although greater progress is being made at
the regional level, a longer time frame than the five years since
Rio will be required to achieve a more thorough understanding of
the knowledge base globally.<P>

(b)   National level institutional arrangements  <P>

19.   Although the issue has been raised in various fora since
UNCED, there continues to be a lack of new institutional
arrangements at national level to enable a more comprehensive and
integrated approach to mountain conservation and development. In
spite of increased international attention since UNCED (through
Chapter 13 follow-up) on the need for reform, examples of
departments, programmes or legislation that deal with mountain
issues in a more integrated way are still rare. This has been an
inhibiting factor in carrying out comprehensive national mountain
development planning; <P>

(c)   Special attention to mountainous island countries and
landlocked countries  <P>

20.   Little attention has been paid so far to the need for
specific consideration for mountainous island countries and
landlocked mountainous countries. Island countries face a unique
situation, especially with regard to water resources. Greater
efforts are needed to better understand the technical issues
facing this category of countries.<P>

                         <CENTER>   V.  EMERGING PRIORITIES</CENTER><P>

21.   Upon completion of the current consultation process for
Chapter 13 follow-up in late 1996, many of the issues concerning
sustainable mountain development, which have so far been discussed
in rather general terms at the global level, will have also
benefitted from discussion in a regional context, allowing for
further elaboration,  refinement and regionally specific proposals
for action. This process has allowed an increased focus on
specific objectives of Chapter 13 and better understanding of how
they can best be achieved. Some key objectives which have emerged
during UNCED and the five-year review period, and for which it now
seems likely that obstacles to achievement can be overcome,
include the following: <P>
  
(a)   Special status of mountain areas  <P>

22.   One of the important achievements of the Chapter 13 review
process has been greater recognition of mountain areas as special
and distinct from lowland areas, and therefore worthy of special
attention. This recognition is seen as a key factor in the recent
change of attitude of governments, intergovernmental organizations
and NGOs to pay greater attention to mountain conservation and
development and in the mobilization of the resources that will be
needed for increased investment in mountain areas. Greater action
at national level is required, including, for example, formulation
of national mountain development plans as part of national
development plans.<P>

(b)    Legal and institutional mechanisms  <P>
      
23.   There is also greater recognition of the need for new or
reinforced legal mechanisms (charters, conventions, national
legislation, etc.) to protect fragile mountain ecosystems and
promote sustainable and equitable development in mountain regions.
Additionally, governments, IGOs and NGOs agree that more suitable
institutional mechanisms are required to assure an integrated
approach in view of the complexity of mountain ecosystems and the
socio- economic issues at stake. <P>

(c)   Investment in mountain development and conservation  <P>

24.   More mountain-specific investment programmes and greater
mobilization of financial resources for mountain development and
conservation programmes will be required in order for real
progress to take place on the "Mountain Agenda". In some cases
this may mean formulating and financing programmes which are
focused exclusively on mountain areas; other situations may lend
themselves to expanding conservation and development programmes
that have been designed for lowland areas to include mountain
areas as well. There are promising signs of greater willingness on
the part of governments to increase investment levels in mountain
areas, which have historically been neglected. In addition,
bi-lateral and multi-lateral donors have expressed greater
willingness to assist mountainous developing countries in
elaborating and implementing mountain development plans and
programmes, in accordance with increased attention being given to
mountain regions and a redefinition of priorities. Greater
investment potential in upland areas is motivated not only by the
need to protect downstream infrastructure and populations, but
also by the realization of the importance of economic development
of mountain populations, for their own benefit and the potential
contribution to national economies, as well as by an increasing
awareness of the importance of biodiversity conservation. <P>

(d)   Resources flows  <P>

25.   Related to (c) above, there remains the need for clearer
understanding of resource flows to and from mountain areas which
will lead to increased income to mountain communities and a fairer
distribution of earnings from natural resources exploitation and
services provided in mountain areas. Increased attention is
already being paid to this important issue, as evidenced by the
electronic conference hosted by the Mountain Forum in 1996,
entitled "Paying for Mountains: Innovative Mechanisms and
Promising Examples for Financing Conservation and Sustainable
Development". The increased attention being paid to this issue,
especially as certain mountain resources (e.g. water) become more
scarce and acquire greater economic value, is expected to result
in more studies undertaken to improve understanding of the overall
flow of resources and services.<P>

(e)   Status of women and children  <P>

26.   The need for greater empowerment, equity and equality of
mountain women has been expressed as an important concern
throughout the period of UNCED and Chapter 13 follow-up. These
issues are expected to receive greater attention in terms of
policy, legislation and institutional reform with growing
awareness and recognition of the role and needs of women related
to mountain development. A recent publication by UNICEF (Children,
Women and Poverty in Mountain Ecosystems, New York, 1996),
produced in collaboration with UNU and IMS, is already drawing
attention to the basic causes of poverty in mountain areas and the
need for policy revisions.<P>

(f)   Cultural integrity and biological diversity  <P>

27.   There is growing recognition of mountain areas as valuable
sites for preserving cultural integrity and conserving biological
diversity. This has come about through increased awareness of
specific mountain cultures and their important role in maintaining
mountain ecosystems, and the greater recognition of endemism of
plant and animal species in mountain areas. More concerted action
is needed to address these increasingly important areas of concern.<P>

(g)   Monitoring progress  <P>

28.   As the "Mountain Agenda" moves forward and mountain
development and conservation efforts grow, it will be necessary to
be able to gauge progress and the extent to which it is
sustainable. An enhanced ability to carry out assessment and
monitoring of mountain development and conservation activities
will be required. The development of a set of criteria and
indicators for sustainable mountain development has been underway
since late 1995. This work is currently being refined with the aim
of providing a practical tool for use at the national or
sub-national level.<P>

(h)   Exchange of experience and information collection and
dissemination  <P>

29.   More direct exchange of experience and information, both
among mountain people themselves and among other resource
management practitioners working in mountain areas is needed.
Exchange visits between groups of farmers from neighboring upland
communities have proved to be among the most effective means of
stimulating new ideas and transferring knowledge in many mountain
conservation and development projects throughout the world in
recent years.  The networks which have been created over the past
few years, especially through activities of the Mountain Forum and
from regional intergovernmental and NGO consultations, should be
fully exploited to stimulate and enhance this type of direct
exchange at all levels. There is also a need for greater
accessibility of existing information to end-users, both at policy
and operational levels. In fact, knowledge and information
dissemination was identified at the 1996 European
Intergovernmental Consultation on chapter 13 as a priority area to
be addressed. Some key issues raised include: the need to
standardize data and data collection;  greater accessibility of
scientific data to decision-makers;  the need for improved
inter-ministerial communication on mountain issues;  and a need
for more interdisciplinary and applied research on mountains. <P>

(i)   Food security  <P>

30.   As highlighted at the World Food Summit held by FAO in Rome
in November 1996, the issue of food security has become a top
priority for the global community. Accordingly, efforts to
eradicate hunger and malnutrition are expected to receive greater
attention under the mountain chapter, along with the overall
objective of poverty alleviation in mountain regions. New
initiatives in this area should focus specifically on strategies
to enhance food security in a sustainable manner, inter alia,
through the sustainable flow of water resources and their
efficient use for agricultural and other production systems.<P>

(j)   Mountain forests  <p>

31.   As new interest and attention is being devoted to the forest
policy debate, especially since the establishment by the CSD of
the Intergovernmental Panel on Forests, new opportunities are
available to further discuss the important role played by forests
in mountain areas with respect to issues such as hazard
prevention, biodiversity conservation and livelihood
opportunities. New institutions and fora, including the European
Observatory on Mountain Forests and the IUFRO Task Force on
Forests and Mountain Development, have recently been established
to focus specifically on these types of issues. FAO is also giving
greater recognition to the importance of forests in mountain
regions and is currently in the process of preparing a publication
on the management of mountain forests.<p>

                           <CENTER>          Notes</CENTER>

1/   This report reviews progress made in the implementation of
the objectives set out in Chapter 13 of Agenda 21 (Managing
fragile ecosystems: sustainable mountain development), taking into
account the decisions taken by the CSD on this subject at its
Third Session in 1995. The report was prepared by FAO as task
manager for chapter 13 of Agenda 21, in accordance with
arrangements agreed to by the Inter-Agency Committee on
Sustainable Development (IACSD). It is the result of consultation
and information exchange between United Nations.<p>

Dear Mountain Forum Colleagues,<p>

A couple days ago a message was forwarded to our discussion list
announcing: "Earth Summit + 5 web page LAUNCHED! (fwd)"  This site
located at <A HREF="http://www.un.org/dpcsd/earthsummit/"> http://www.un.org/dpcsd/earthsummit/ </A> is useful,
relevant and very informative to anyone concerned with the
Mountain Agenda.<p>

In 1992 over 100 heads-of-state met in Rio de Janeiro for the
United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED),
also know as the Earth Summit.  In Rio Agenda 21, a 300 page plan
for achieving sustainable development in the 21st century, was
adopted.  Chapter 13 of Agenda 21 is "Managing Fragile Ecosystems:
Sustainable Mountain Development".<p>

Also in Rio, the Commission on Sustainable Development (CSD) was
created to monitor and report on implementation of the Earth
Summit agreements.  It was agreed that a five year review of Earth
Summit progress would be made in 1997 by the United Nations
General Assembly meeting in  special session. This special session
of the UN General Assembly will take stock of how well countries,
international organizations and sectors of civil society have
responded to the challenge of the Earth Summit. <p>

Agenda 21 in its entirety, including Chapter 13 the Mountain
Agenda, will be reviewed over a series of events at the UN
headquarters in New York.  These events are listed below.<p>

Other useful information from the Earth Summit+5 web page are
links to the official UN documents of the Mountain Agenda, which
include Chapter 13, and UNCSD Secretary General Reports on Chapter
13 from 1995 and 1997.  The 1997 Secretary General's report
specifically mentions the Mountain Forum as an example of
successful partnering and information sharing initiatives of the
mountain constituency. <p> 

We have downloaded these public domain documents and are putting
them on the "Resources" section of the Mountain Forum's web page
at <A HREF="http://www.mtnforum.org."> http://www.mtnforum.org. </A>  If anyone wishes to receive these

THE ASIA PACIFIC MOUNTAIN NETWORK (APMN)
FIRST CONSULTATION OF THE APMN COORDINATORS, ICIMOD, KATHMANDU, NEPAL, MARCH 17 - 19, 1997<P>
         
 CIRCULAR<P>

Background to the APMN<P>

The first-ever meeting on the mountain areas of Asia, held in December
1994 in Kathmandu called upon the International Centre for Integrated
Mountain Development (ICIMOD) to facilitate and promote information
exchange about Asian mountain areas so as to help bring about
sustainable mountain development. Consequently, the Asia Pacific
Mountain Network (APMN), an informal forum for the exchange of
information and sharing of knowledge affecting mountain development in
the Asia/Pacific region, was established. The APMN is coordinated by
ICIMOD through a special grant from the Swiss Agency for Development
and Cooperation. <P>

Objectives of the APMN<P>

The main objective of the APMN is to facilitate and promote
information exchange about sustainable development of mountain areas
among professionals, development workers, and policy-makers in Asian
countries by establishing connectivity and interlinkages between these
individuals and agencies. It also aims to sensitise donor agencies
about the need for and options regarding sustainable mountain
development. <P>

Activities of the APMN<P>

The principal activities of the APMN include the following.
. Establishing a network through mail and other means among
individuals and agencies working in mountain development and
encouraging these to share and exchange their individual experiences,
knowledge, issues, and problems in mountain development . Establishing
focal points in different subregions of Asia in an effort to develop
and establish strong subregional linkages for information exchange and
sharing<P>

FIRST CONSULTATION OF THE APMN COORDINATORS<P>

Objectives of the Meeting<P>

The First Consultation of the Subregional Focal Points is,
essentially, a face to face interaction for further defining and
refining the activities of the APMN. It aims to build a concrete
programme, for each subregion as well as for the entire network, which
includes the identification of critical issues and priorities. It also
seeks to bring together the experiences, activities, and knowledge of
other networks and mountain groups. The principal task at hand is to
identify ways and means for energising the network. <P>

Issues to be discussed<P>

The issues and topics to be discussed include the structure, roles,
and responsibilities of each subregional focal point and of the APMN
as a whole; their proposed future activities; the gaps, new thrusts,
and priorities as identified collectively as well as individually by
each focal point; and the regional priorities and initiatives of each
focal point. The ways to establish strong interlinkages within and
between the different subregions will also be discussed and
identified. As mentioned above, the meeting will also include
discussions and presentations by other networks.

International Workshop on Dynamics of Land-Use/
Land-Cover Change in the Hindu Kush-Himalaya<P>

April 20-25, 1997<BR>
Kathmandu, Nepal<P>

Second Circular<BR>
Distribution Date: January 1, 1997<P>

Sponsored by US National Science Foundation, IGBP START/SASCOM, 
& International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD)<P>

Organized by: Lisa J. Graumlich, Institute for the Study of Planet
Earth, University of Arizona and Sharad Adhikary, Himalayan Climate
Center, Kathmandu<P>

Background:  Accelerating rates of land-use and land-cover change are
increasingly recognized as a critical component of global change.
Land-cover changes may significantly interact with global
biogeochemistry to alter future climate.  In addition, alterations in
land cover often presage changes in resources that are critical to
human livelihood.  Understanding the global implications of current
trends necessitates interdisciplinary studies of regional patterns and
processes.  Mountain regions, in general, and the Hindu-Kush Himalaya
(HKH), in particular, are areas of great physical and cultural
diversity, and where rapid environmental change is often coupled with
severe socio-economic consequences.<P>

Objectives:  The International Workshop on Dynamics of
Land-Use/Land-Cover Change in the Hindu Kush-Himalaya will provide a
forum where researchers from Asia and around the world can synthesize
and stimulate an interdisciplinary investigation of the nature and
consequences of land-use/land-cover changes in HKH.  The following
questions as critical in this endeavor:<P>

1.      What can we learn from comparative case studies of land-use
dynamics? What do existing and ongoing case studies for the HKH
indicate about the relative importance of various social drivers and
proximate causes of land-use change at key spatial and temporal
scales?  Can concepts and techniques drawn from hierarchical theory be
useful for identifying a small number of variables that control
pattern and process at a given scale.  <P>

2.      What can we learn from direct observation of land-cover dynamics?
How can information from satellite remote sensing be linked with
analyses of land use to best inform our understanding of land-cover
dynamics?<P>

3.      How do we forge integration at regional to global scales? Can we
define a framework and science plan that fosters integration of case
study approaches with data sets derived from direct observations,
especially remote sensing, national censuses and land cover
inventories?  How can we best integrate our understanding of the
dynamics of the HKH region, in particular, and mountain regions, in
general, into global studies? <P>

Our goal is to define a regional implementation strategy for the
emerging Science Plan for Land Use and Cover Change (LUCC) as
established by the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP)
and the Human Dimensions Program (HDP).<P>

Call for Abstracts:  We request that all workshop participants submit
an abstract in which their research is described in the context of one
or more of the three critical questions defined above.  The abstracts
are vital for organizing sessions and determining the expertise of the
participants.  In order to allow ample time for discussion and
development of a Science and Implementation Plan, the number of formal
presentations will be limited.  The Workshop Steering Committee will
select a small number of papers for oral presentation based on the
abstract submissions.  We encourage other participants to present
their research in poster format (see Program below).<P>

Abstracts are due March 1, 1997 and should be submitted in the format

The 4th International Workshop on African Mountains and Highlands,
with the theme "African Mountain Development in a Changing
Economic World", will be organized in Madagascar in May/June 1997
(exact dates to be announced later).  The Workshop will form a
part of the UNU/IMS Mountain Ecology and Sustainable Development
(MESD) project.  In a major capacity building effort in African,
MESD has supported the establishment of the African Mountain
Association (AMA), as well as organized together with AMA the
three earlier African mountain workshops (Ethiopia, Morocco, Kenya).  <P>

The objectives of the Workshop are as follows:<P>

1. To share experiences in African mountains related to the
workshop theme;<BR>

2. To discuss local strategies of rural families and communities
in mountainous areas;<BR>

3. To discuss economic and policy issues relating to mountain
development at national scales;<BR>

4. To define research needs and strategies to enhance African
research competence; and,<BR>

5. To obtain an insight into Madagascar's mountain development
problems.<P>

Following the Workshop, a proceedings will be published, possibly
including a theme issue of the UNU journal Mountain Research and
Development.<P>

The principal Workshop language will be French, but the English
summaries and translation will be provided, whenever feasible.<P>

The Workshop will include a field excursion, a transect from the
Eastern coastal plain, to the shifting cultivation area in the
Eastern escarpment region, to the central hilly plateau region
around Antananarivo, and finally, to the nearby volcanic peak at
about 2,500 m asl.

Eighth Colloquium<BR>
June 5-8, 1997<P>

The 8th Colloquium of the International Association for
Ladakh Studies is scheduled to be held from June 5-8, 1997
at Moesgaard, a few miles south of Aarhus in Denmark.<P>

The IALS colloquia have been held regularly, usually every
other year, since 1983, and are intended to bring together
people interested or engaged in Ladakh studies from many
disciplines. Although the majority of participants generally
have a social science or humanities background, other
disciplines are welcome. With a view to broadening the scope
of Ladakh studies and to foster discussions and exchanges 
across political as well as disciplinary boundaries, 
researchers working in Baltistan are also very welcome.<P>

At this time, we are inviting proposals for papers and/or
panels. Anyone interested in participating is requested to 
pre-register at this time and - if applicable - to submit a
short (250 words) abstract for a paper, preferably in hard 
copy and on disk (IBM compatible) or by e-mail.<P>

Call for papers and provisional registration.<P>

Jointly convened by:<BR>
 * European Academy, Bolzano, Italy<BR>
 * Standing Committee on Headwater Control<BR>
 * International Association of Hydrological Sciences<P>

The conference will be held under the patronage of Dr. Luis 
Durnwalder, President of the Government of South Tyrol.  
This conference is a contribution to UNESCO's International 
Hydrological Programme (IHP-V, 1996-2001), "Hydrology and 
water resources development in a vulnerable environment".  
Sponsors include UNESCO, FAO/European Forestry Commission, 
International Association for Hydraulic Research, 
International Erosion Control Association, International 
Union of Forest Research Organizations, World Association 
of Soil and Water Conservation.<P>

Objectives and Scope<P>

Headwaters are the places where rivers are born.  They are 
the furthest, highest, and most remote regions of a 
watershed.  Many headwaters also lie at the periphery of 
national regional economies and on the front-lines of 
agricultural and economic development.  Frequently, 
headwaters are wilderness and steepland.  Economic 
activities in headwaters include agriculture, forest 
farming, mining, tourism, hydroelectric power and water 
supply.  They are often regions of social and military 
conflict.  However, many headwater regions are critical to 
water resources development.  Traditionally, their low 
level of human activity, rugged landscape, and isolation 
from major industrial centres have made them valued for the 
purity of their landscapes and their surface and 
groundwater production.  Today, this water purity is 
threatened by atmospheric acid deposition, by erosion 
associated with accelerating land-use conversion and 
development, and by the pollution associated with increased 
intensities of agriculture, mining, road, military and 
tourism. <P> 

Headwaters may also be of major importance as conservated 
reserves of natural ecosystems and wildlife.  Headwater 
ecosystems are fragile (higher elevation, steeper slope, 
extreme precipitation and temperature), and particularly 
sensitive to environmental pollution and decline.<P>

This conference will focus on the interdisciplinary aspects 
of scientific and applied water resource management.  It 
will aim to link the perspectives of the research 
scientists, land-management practitioners and policy makers 
through consideration of the problems caused by pollution, 
land erosion, and environmental degradation.  The 
conference will provide an international forum for the 
evaluation of alternative land management, environmental 
protection and land reclamation practices and policies.<P>


Conference Topics<P>

The conference is organized around the following main themes:<BR>
1. Monitoring<BR>
2. Processes<BR>
3. Modeling <BR>
4. Management<BR>

Each of these themes relates to the following aspects:<BR>
A. Hydrology<BR>
B. Ecology<BR>
C. Socio-economic aspects<BR>
D. Interdisciplinary approaches<BR>

Call for Papers<P>

Both oral and poster presentations are planned. 
Participants intending to present their work are requested
to send a 1-page abstract in English to the Conference 
Secretariat.<P>

Important Deadlines<BR>

<P>The Alps - Touchstone of Europe<BR>
Invitation to an International Alpine Congress<BR>
Sevrier, France, September 19-20, 1996<P>

The Nature Friends International will conclude its project "Landscape of the Year 1995/96 - The Alps" with an international expert congress on "The Alps and Europe".<P>

The European Single Market has, rightly or wrongly, given rise to diffuse fears among the people living in mountain regions.  Like the people in many other regions, the inhabitants of the Alpine region expect the Single Market to strengthen their economic position and, in addition, to safeguard the quality of their environment and life.  The Alps are consequently a touchstone for the establishment
 of a Europe of regions.  The Alpine Conventions is the first attempt at safeguarding the sustainable development in a border-crossing region by way of an international agreement.  Many obstacles will have to be overcome, however, and many problems solved before this goal can be achieved.  In this context the general European framework, which may be favorable or un favourable to a sustainable deve
lopment, is of paramount importance.<P>

In preparation for the Congress, a "Green Paper on the Alps"  will be put together with the assistance of experts.  Starting from the prevailing, general European framework and the situation resulting from it, the Green Paper is to provide the answer to the following question:  What are the criteria of a general European framework conducive to a sustainable development in the Alpine region?<P>

The Alpine Congress of the Nature Friends International is meant to trigger a Europe-wide discussion of this issue.  The individual chapters of the Green Paper will be presented at the Congress by experts from the Alpine region.  Representatives of the European Commission will take up these topics and set out the pertinent EU policies as well as the possibilities of revising them.<P>

Programme:<BR>
Thursday, September 19<BR>
* Opening and welcome address<BR>
* Keynote address<BR>
* Introduction to the Green Paper<BR>
* Discussion<BR>
* Transport: Green light for quality of life<BR>

 <BR>
From: Massimo Antoninetti <P>


I'm a 42 years old geologist, research scientist at the Remote Sensing Dept. 
of the Institute of Research on Seismic Risk, located in Milan, Northern 
Italy. The Institute forms part of the National Research Centre (CNR) of 
Italy in the frame of the Ministry of University and Scientific Research.
The Department has been created in beginning of '70 to study and apply the 
remote sensing techniques on the environment.<P>

My research activities in high mountain are related to the application of 
enhanced and classified satellite data for geo-structural studies, snow and 
ice investigations including the glacial and periglacial phenomena, such as 
the permafrost. I use the fuzzy set theory in a Decision Support System 
knowledge-based to classify the images, I'm also working on the settle-up of 
the GIS of EV-K2-CNR Project. <P>


In the Mountain Forum I would like to represent this project sponsored by 
CNR and located in the Himalayas, I'm working on a EV-K2-CNR Web page at the 
following address: <BR>
http://www.tel-irrs.mi.cnr.it/ <BR>  
This is the home page of my Dept., here you can follow the Ev-K2 project 
address.<P>

Let me, finally, briefly describe the Project.<P>

The EV-K2-CNR Project<P>

The EV-K2-CNR Project born in 1987 as an expedition aimed to the measurement 
of the height of Mount Everest and K2, after the sensational announcement in 
the USA press that K2 was supposed to be higher than Everest. Prof. Ardito 
Desio, the geologist who led the first ascent to K2 in 1954, was the project 
promoter.
These initial operations were the starting point for further checks and 
researches in the geodetic, geophysical and geological fields in the 
Himalayas and Karakorum ranges.
In 1989, two Italian industrial groups offered the project with a "Pyramid" 
of glass and aluminium to host the scientific laboratories with the special 
and delicate equipment necessary to the researches.<P>

Because of a cooperation agreement signed between the Italian National 
Research Centre (CNR) and the Royal Nepal Academy of Science and Technology 
(RONAST), the Pyramid has been installed at 5,050 m of altitude in the 
Sagarmatha (Everest) National Park above the mountain pasture of Lobuche, 
near the Base Camp, starting point to climb Everest.
The "Laboratory of studies and research at high altitude" is a three-storied 
glass and aluminium pyramid, measuring 13 m at the base and 9 m in height.
Due to laboratory's unique position, the power generating system was 
conceived to be highly reliable, easy to install, simple to conceive, and 
environmental friendly: micro-hydraulic unit, photovoltaic panels, and wind 
generator.<P>

During the last years of activity, the Pyramid hosted more than 300 
researchers coming from different countries who produced hundreds papers, 
articles and specialised publications.
More, climbers and backpackers had the possibilities to used the medical 
facilities of the laboratory to cure the mountain sickness, it is also the 
only centre supplied with satellite telephone in this area.
The Pyramid can offer an unique possibilities for researches in different 
fields: Medical, Environmental, Earth Science and Technological studies.
The same researchers are also involved in similar research activities in the 
European Alps, in Antarctica and North Pole.
The Project signed international agreement with: RONAST, Nepal; Himalayan 
Research for Science and Technology NGO, Nepal; Centre for Integrated 
Mountain Research, Pakistan; Tibetan Academy of Social Science, Tibet. <P>

Reconfirming, if necessary, my complete availability to provide any other 
information regarding the project and thanking you for the kind attention, I 
remain.<P>

Dear readers:<P>

Hi! I am Ricardo Ayala and I am a Civil Engineer with specialty in
hydraulics; I am pleased to participate with all of you in this
list.<P>

I have fulfilled the post of Director of Water Basins, from the
Ministry of Sustainable Development and Environment in Bolivia,
since october 1995 until now.<P>

35% of Bolivia's territory is mountain zone (1,100,000 km2) and 65%
of the population (7,000,000 inhab. approx.) lives on this part. As
you well understand, the majority of the people live  in  the
mountain zone, where one can find the city of La Paz and El Alto
(1,800,000 inhab.). This is why I am so interested in being
acquainted with experiences in the management of natural resources
on mountain zones.<P>

Since 1992, in Bolivia we have stared to work with pilot
experiences in water management on mountain zones, which are found
now on an inplementation and evaluation phase. Once I have the
final results from these  experiences, I will be delighted to
share them with you all.<P>

I will be most grateful if anyone can provide me  references from
experiences on water management on similar mountain zones.<P>


Thanks!  <P>

Dear Participants in the Mountain Forum<P>

Please allow me to briefly introduce myself, my name is Lee Porter Butler
and I am a practicing  architect with thirty three (33) years of experience
designing and building sustainable Ekosea homes, all over the world.
Ekose'a is an ancient Greek word defining "the essence of being", family,
food and shelter. The Ekosea homes described in my book reflect that
philosophy.<P>

I would define "sustainable mountain development" and mountain conservation
as building designs which do not require resources or produce pollution.
These are the designs we should all be seeking to develop. Once they are
being manufactured by the same techniques we use to create automobiles,
airplanes and ships, they will be affordable, flexible and permanent.<P>

The new global utility will utilize "technology" or knowledge to take the
place of resources.<P>

I believe a major source of pollution as well as stress, work and the
conversion of fossil resources arises from trying to stay warm in cold
mountainous
climates. What could be more relevant that a simple concept for eliminating
heating energy requirements in areas where there is nothing left to burn.
Is this not the very definition of sustainability, where we live. If these
designs also allowed for the production of the family's food supply, would
it not further raise the standard of living of all people.<P>

The Ekosea home integrates solar, gravity and geothermal energy in a unique
patented design, to bring the interior state of the home into thermal and
environmental equilibrium. <P>

The design is especially easy to adapt to mountain regions.<P>

Please contact me for more information.
With best wishes for the success of the forum,
I am sincerely yours,<P>

<P>

     Hi everyone,<P>
     
     My name is Steve Caicco.  I'm a botanist/plant ecologist 
     interested in mountain biodiversity and conservation.  I did my 
     graduate research on the classification and ordination of high 
     elevation plant communities in the Rocky Mountains of Idaho 
     (USA).  That was over a dozen years ago.  Since then I've worked 
     in many fields mostly related to conservation.  Most recently 
     I've been studying riparian ecosystems.<P>
     
     My present job is with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 
     Portland, Oregon, where I work in the endangered species arena.  
     Although I currently have no active research in mountainous 
     areas, I retain my interest in mountain environments worldwide.  
     I am particularly interested in the high mountains of tropical 
     Africa and have visited Mt. Kenya twice over the past several 
     years.  Thank you for taking the time to read this.  I look 
     forward to discussing our common interests in the mountain forum.<P>
     
     Sincerely,<P>

My name is Olivier Chave.<P>

I am presently working in Hanoi, Vietnam, as Deputy Resident
Coordinator, Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC).<P>

My previous assignement with SDC was in the field of Multilateral
Cooperation. In this capacity I took part in the entire Rio
(UNCED) process and in its follow-up. It offered me the great
opportunity to cooperate closely with the fantastic constituency
advocating the "Mountain Agenda" (Agenda 21, chapter 13).<P>

My present activities are essentially to develop an extensive SDC
program in Vietnam - which is a new "focus country" for Swiss ODA.
I am especially in charge of the "green sector", with two major
(but not exclusive) components: sustainable land resources
management and
environment monitoring.<P>

Since SDC decided not to work in the two large delta zones (Red
River and Mekong) we are active in the hilly/mountainous regions
of Vietnam - which represent around 75% of the national territory.
Our entry point
was "social forestry" but, given the forestry situation in the
country, we are rapidly reorienting toward a much more
comprehensive and integrated conception of land resources. We also
decided recently to focus on the general question of "training for
extension", at all levels, with a strong emphasis on participatory
approaches.<P>

We are promoting national and regional networking and partnership.
In this context we try e.g. to valorize the activities of regional
Centers such as IBSRAM (International Board for Soil Research and
Management)
and its program "Asialand-Slopingland" - a new partner of ICIMOD
and CIP within CGIAR's Mountain Initiative - or RECOFTC (Regional
Community Forestry Trainig Center) or Asian Institute of
Technology's SERD (School of Environment, Resources and Development).<P>

<A NAME="MCohen">
Date: July 20, 1996<BR>
From: steenbok@iafrica.com<P>

First let me express my gratitude to all who are participating in the
list.  I have found the contributions to be of great interest and
value.<P>

As introduction - I am Mike Cohen from the new Eastern Cape Province,
South Africa. The new province was formed after the first democratic
elections of 1994. Until six weeks ago, I occupied the post of
Director
of Nature conservation in the new province. I have since resigned this
position and opened a consulting business attached to a
Community Based Organization, Community Environment Network,
which was established during the struggle against apartheid. The idea
of the consultancy is to generate funds for the CBO and to provide
training for young scientists and environmentalists from the formally 
disadvantaged community. We are becoming involved in a series
of community based projects ranging from urban agriculture through
environmental impact assessments to assisting the new
provincial government with certain restructuring problems.<P>

My interest in mountains is as follows. many of the mountainous areas
of the Eastern Cape are heavily infested with alien plants, mainly
the alien acacias from Australia that were introduced to South Africa
over the years. These aliens have had a tremendous negative impact
on the water production from the catchments. The hard engineering
option in rectifying the problem is to build more dams. The soft
option
is to involve communities in the clearing of the aliens. A project
has 
commenced here which has established several hundred jobs
for people clearing alien vegetation and at the same time is leading
to a better management of the catchment area. This is especially
important in that we are suffering for a 70 percent unemployment in
parts of the province.<P>

A further problem that we are faced with is the establishment
of a comprehensive system of protected areas and the funding of
such a system. Here I am interested in learning more about Trust
Funds and Debt for Nature Swaps as well as other mechanisms
for the funding of protected areas. I would also like to learn more
of how protected areas are managed in other parts of the world.
For example here in South Africa, each of the Provincial
conservation agencies are establishing their own nature conservation
organization. These will take the form of full government
departments or statutory boards. There is also a statutory
national parks board which is responsible for the national parks
system.<P>

There are therefor 10 organizations looking after the protected area
estate in South Africa and competing for a slice of the same cake.
Linked to these 10 nature conservation organizations which are
either statutory boards or full government departments are a further
environmental protection components which look at the
broader environmental issues of waste management, pollution control,
development planning etc.<P>

I should be glad if participants in the list could let me have
reference
material on the funding of protected areas, mountain or other, and
examples of the administrative structures that have been
established to 
manage the protected area system. Please bear in mind that we are
fairly 
isolated in the Eastern Cape and that it is not always easy to obtain
obscure reference material.<P>

Many thanks<P>

Policy and Management program at Cornell University. I am currently studying
the viability of stakeholder involvement in natural resource decision-making
in the Copper Canyon region of Chihuahua, Mexico (Sierra Madre Occidental
Mountain Range). Citizen/public involvement is particularly relevant at this
moment, where various government agencies are independently proposing
different regional plans for this area (Tourism Master Plan, Sustainable
Forestry Plan, a possible Protected Area) and could perhaps benefit from
input from a wide range of stakeholders.<P>

This is the first time I am participating in an electronic discussion group. <P>

Dear Subscriber and Members of Mountain Forum,<P>
I have just subscribed and become a member of your "group", I would 
like to present myself to all of you.  My name is Agostino Da Polenza 
and my life and my work have always been and still are related to 
mountains.<P>

I started my relation with mountain as a visitor, then as an alpinist (I
reached the peak of K2 in 1983 from the chinese face) and last years as,
coordinator, leader or organisator of many mountaineering and scientific
expeditions in the Himalaya and Karakorum range.<P>

I am now managing Ev-K2-CNR Project, a multidisciplinary project related to
high altitude which base of research is the Pyramid Laboratory-Observatory
installed at Lobuche, at an altitude of 5050m nearby the base camp of Mt.
Everest.  I hope that this is enough for the moment and that my presence will be
useful and fruitful for you all and for myself.<P>

Thanks and best regards.<BR>
Agostino Da Polenza<P>

I'm Gary Garriott and have been involved in international development
work in one way or another for the past 27 years, including a
four-year
Peace Corps stint in Ecuador where just being in and around the Andes
was an incredible yet in some ways mystical experience. I've also
spent
a week trekking in Nepal and someday hope to figure out a way to
get to
Bhutan!
<P>
My main interest is seeing how to provide useful lowcost
communications
technologies to help preserve/protect mountain environments. My
employer
VITA (Volunteers in Technical Assistance) has been involved with low
earth orbiting satellites for the past 13-14 years which has the
capability of supplying Internet email connection for tough
environments
like mountain valleys.<P>

My I-don't-want-to-grow-up dream is to take one of these small
boxes that
can do email from a battery pack and climb Mt. Kilimanjaro! Maybe it
could be part of a general fundraising
effort/consciousness-raising event
about the fragility and importance of mountain environments in
general.
Ideas along these lines are welcome.<P>

Good luck on the conference(s).<P>

<P>

Greetings Mountain Forum Members!<p>

My name is Mark Haberle and I am a resident of the United States living
in the Green mountain State of Vermont.  I am currently employed with
the Vermont Center for Geographic Information as  GIS Data Technician. 
You may visit the site at <A HREF="http://geo-vt.uvm.edu ">http://geo-vt.uvm.edu </A> and further visit my
staff page under the "more about VCGI and its staff" link.<p>

I have been interested in the mountains of Northern New England since I
was a child.  Particular enjoyment stemmed from the open Alpine summits
of the White, Green, and Adirondack mountains.  I also have fond
memories of the sweet smell of decaying hardwood leaves from Connecticut
where I grew up.<p>

In December of 1996 I graduated from the University of Vermont with a
degree in Environmental Studies from the School of Natural Resources.  I
earned the degree from the multi-disciplinary Environmental Program with
a focus in Ecological Restoration and Monitoring.  To complete my
studies I designed and implemented a monitoring protocol for the summit
ridgeline of Mount Mansfield in Vermont.  This protocol, Photographic
Inventory Monitoring System, is designed to provide a quantifiable data
set on trends in the alpine communities directly adjacent to the highly
traveled trail treadway.<p>

Current work in the GIS field has me curious about the applicability of
GIS technology to the small scale for impact trend analysis and
monitoring.  I would love to begin a dialogue specific to trail treadway
trend analysis and monitoring techniques including the use of
photography as a monitoring tool.<p>

I look forward to participating in the Mountain Forum.<P>

Hello in Mountain Forum,<P>

I would like to join the discussion on PFM.<BR>
My  name is  Irena Hanouskova.  Subject of  my work  is landscape
ecology.  I  am  improved  in  natural  sciences.  Nowadays, I am
oriented  particularly  to  historical  development  of landscape
structure, land use forms of Sumava Mts.<P>

Following contribution describes one way of long-term development
resulting in  area sustainability. Landscape  ecology approach is
used for the description. I am convinced, that the conditions and
constraints, gathered in Sumava case study might be considered in
analogies to similar areas with similar trajectory of land-use.
Information  is  elaborated  in  the  study  "Future for Sumava",
Institute of Landscape Ecology in 1995(-1997.)<P>


Information, which I consider as important for further contacts:<P>
(1) Project  "Biodiversity of Sumava" is  solved on the Institute
of Landscape Ecology, Czech  Republic. Sustainable development of
the  Sumava region  (Sumava Mts,  Central Europe,  large area was
declared as  National Park) is focussed  in social and economical
context. Groups  of economically and  ideologically active people
are  classified  and  assigned  to  their  roles  for  innovative
financial mechanisms in the area. For detail information contact:
Biodiversity  project, manager,  Institute of  Landscape Ecology,
Academy of Sciences, Na sadkach 7, 370 05 Ceske Budejovice, Czech
Republic.<P>
(2)  The  National  Park  Administration  is  the  most important
controlling  subject  of  Sumava  area.  Park  is responsible for
nature protection, scientific research, education and instruction
of public (particularly local  inhabitants and tourists). Park is
supported  from  national  level,  has  its  own  production  and
investments. The  important tool for  nature protection and  self
maintainig of undisturbed environment is the legacy which has the
long tradition  in Czech Republic.  Presently the possibility  of
accepting  a  special  law  for  National  Park  Sumava  is being
discussed. It might state better  condition for park economy. For
detail  information  contact:  National  Park  Sumava,  director,
Namesti 84, 341 92 Kasperske Hory, Czech Republic.<P>

<STRONG>INTRODUCTION</STRONG><P>

Tourism has become the world's largest industry, generating US $3.4 trillion in gross annual output, attracting $693 billion in capital investment, and providing over 200 million jobs globally (The World Travel and Tourism Council, 1996)   Travelers that enjoy and appreciate nature represent between 40% and 60% of the 500 millions that cross international boundaries every year, and for a growing number of countries, tourism based on natural attractions is a top earner of foreign exchange.  Given its economic power, tourism provides powerful incentives to government policy makers and local people to conserve natural and cultural resources which attract outside visitors.  Nevertheless, the immensity of the tourism industry and the possibility of its explosive growth in a region can overwhelm natural resources and community infrastructure.<P>

For the last 15 years ecotourism has been heralded as one of the most promising tools for the conservation of natural habitats.  These high expectations have not been fully realized and critics claim that many ecotourism ventures are simply a  Trojan horse--marketing tourism as environmentally friendly, but in fact destroying the very ecosystems they claim to protect.  Attaching the "ecotourism" label to poorly planned projects provides local populations with little besides social tension and environmental degradation, while leaving the tourist dissatisfied and cheated.  However, Conservation International (CI) believes that when planned and implemented properly, ecotourism can be both an effective conservation tool and a successful community development model.<P>

<STRONG><CENTER>Conservation International's mission in ecotourism is 
  to develop and support ecotourism enterprises that contribute to conservation; and
 to influence the broader tourism industry towards greater ecological sustainability.</CENTER></STRONG><br>
The CI Ecotourism Program pursues these objectives through the following activities:<P>

<STRONG>National/Regional Ecotourism Strategies</STRONG>--To maximize the conservation impact of ecotourism, CI is involved with evaluating the conservation potential of ecotourism on a national/regional level, developing ecotourism policy through a regional consensus building process, and assisting policy implementation.  Currently, the ecotourism program is working to develop an ecotourism strategy for the <STRONG>Inka Region </STRONG>in Peru.<P>








<STRONG>Capacity Building</STRONG>--The Ecotourism Program uses a local capacity building approach to ensure that ecotourism benefits communities and merges with traditional practices and conservation.  The Ecotourism Program provides effective training for both CI-local staff and community members to help them understand and manage ecotourism enterprises.  In addition to conducting training workshops, the Ecotourism Program supports capacity-building by helping to organize local ecotourism societies and disseminating detailed information on model ecotourism projects in the form of case studies.  Highlights of the Program's capacity building efforts include the <STRONG>Brazil Train-the-Trainers Workshops </STRONG>and the development and support of <STRONG>INDECON (Indonesian Ecotourism Network.)</STRONG>  Important case studies on CI s ecotourism efforts in <STRONG>Brazil, Guatemala,</STRONG> and <STRONG>Ghana </STRONG>will be developed in 1996.<P>

<STRONG>Ecotourism Product Development</STRONG>--An ecotourism product is a combination of resources, activities, and tourism services which are sold and managed through professional tour operators.  The Ecotourism Program seeks to develop ecotourism products which benefit local communities and meet conservation objectives in design, implementation, and management.  Special ecotourism product development highlights are the <STRONG>Scarlet Macaw Trail</STRONG> in Guatemala, the <STRONG>Canopy Walkway</STRONG> in Ghana, the <STRONG>Chalalan Lodge</STRONG> in Bolivia and <STRONG>Makira Island</STRONG> in the Solomon Islands.  <P>

<STRONG>International Marketing</STRONG>--To ensure the business sustainability of the ecotourism products, the Ecotourism Program actively markets CI destinations to both international tour operators and directly to ecotourists.  Ongoing marketing efforts have contributed to the success of the        Eco-Escuela in Guatemala and a new marketing highlight for the Ecotourism Program is the development of the <STRONG>Ecotravel Center</STRONG>, an Internet home-page dedicated to providing information for the ecotourist.  <P>



<STRONG>CURRENT PROJECTS<P>

<STRONG>BOLIVIA</STRONG><P></STRONG>

The Alto Madidi Region of northwestern Bolivia is located in a belt of high biodiversity which runs through western South America where the Andes meet the Amazon basin.  CI's work in the region in the early 1990s started with a Rapid Assessment Program (RAP) Expedition which reported the region as being of great significance, with extremely high levels of biodiversity.  The government of Bolivia has recognized the importance of the Madidi area by establishing the Madidi National Park in 1995 and is now looking to ecotourism as a means of generating income for the people living in and around this important ecosystem.  <P>

<STRONG>Ecolodge at Chalalan</STRONG>--CI is in a unique position to demonstrate the potential of ecotourism through the development of a model ecolodge at Chalalan.  With full support from local CI project managers, a small group of entrepreneurs from the Quechua-Tacana community of San Jos de Uchiapomonas constructed a few buildings in the local thatched-hut style at Lake Chalalan, a site located 2 hours by boat down river from the village.  These facilities were constructed for the existing backpacker market in Rurrenabaque.  With the help of a grant from the Inter-American Development Bank, CI has worked with experts in the field of landscape architecture from Design Workshop Inc., to ensure that the lodge will serve as a prototype for ecotourism sustainable technologies and architecture. The CI Ecotourism Program will work to ensure the effective training of community members in tourism planning and management.  This will enable them to successfully assume responsibility and ownership of all aspects of the operation by the year 2000.<P>


<STRONG>BRAZIL</STRONG><P>

Brazil is a country of continental proportions in both land mass and population.  Although recognized as the nation with the world's highest level of terrestrial diversity, each of the five major biomes of Brazil--the Amazon, the Atlantic Forest, the Pantanal Wetland, the Cerrado and the Caatinga--are significantly threatened by a variety of human activities.  The development of ecotourism as an alternative to destructive land-use practices has been a priority for the CI-Brazil Program since 1992.<P>

<STRONG>Ecotourism Train-the-Trainers Workshops</STRONG>--In 1992, CI developed a strategy for a series of ecotourism workshops for Brazil.  A 10-day train-the-trainers workshop was conceived in order to build local capacity and to adapt relevant procedures and technology to Brazilian culture and circumstances.  With a consortium of NGOs and The Ecoplan:net Institute, CI has been holding a series of  workshops since 1994.  These workshops trained tourism professionals from 8 Brazilian states to be interactive instructors (called facilitators) capable of conducting a 5-day regional ecotourism workshops.  From an original group of 35 facilitators, more than 600 individuals throughout Brazil have participated in 20 workshops.  Sixteen of the original train-the-trainers workshop participants continue to assist CI-ecotourism initiatives in Brazil as members of a Group of Specialists, and have been invited to implement the training portion of  Brazil's new National Ecotourism Plan. In December 96, further training of the original facilitators will enable them to become consultants for sustainable tourism and ecotourism developments, and to train other trainers who will disseminate the methodology  in the nine States of the Brazilian Legal Amazon. With 58 additional workshops planned for 1996, this initiative continues to meet the CI's objective of  increasing local capacity to develop and implement ecotourism ventures.    <P>

<STRONG>The Atlantic Forest</STRONG>--In the southern portion of this highly endangered rain forest, the Ecotourism Program is working to guarantee buffer zones around the Biological Reserve of Una, in Southern Bahia.  In an effort to counteract threats from logging interests in the area, the Ecotourism Program has been discussing the benefits of ecotourism to private land-owners in the area who are looking for alternative revenue sources.  One of these land-owners has been convinced that ecotourism is more lucrative than logging in the long run, and CI will be working with him to develop the tourism potential on his land.  Additionally, the Ecotourism Program is cooperating with our local partner, Instituto de Estudos Socioambientais do Sul da Bahia (IESB,) to develop a wildlife rehabilitation and visitor center for a nearby 250-room resort. <P>

<STRONG>National Marine Park of Abrolhos</STRONG>--The National Marine Park of Abrolhos, located off the coast of Southern Bahia, is the first and only marine park in Brazil.  Unfortunately, irresponsible tourism has seriously threatened seabird nesting colonies and marine fauna in and around the park boundaries.  To counter these threats, CI will be leading a consortium of NGOs in an effort to devise a management plan.  A large component of this plan will be focused on more effective regulation of tourism.<P>


<STRONG>GUATEMALA</STRONG><P>

The Maya Biosphere Reserve in Northern Guatemala is the largest remaining tract of intact tropical rainforest in Central America.  Its high level of biodiversity, and its remarkable cultural heritage contribute greatly to its ecotourism potential.  The northern lowland tropical forests provide an extensive, but highly threatened, ecosystem which makes up the Department of the Petn.  The Petn was once the center of Maya civilization and is home to the ancient city of Tikal, which draws hundreds of thousands of visitors each year.  However, travel to the Petn region has traditionally consisted only of one to two day excursions.  This has meant that local communities have received few benefits from tourism and visitors have missed opportunities to explore ecological, cultural, and other archaeological riches that the Petn has to offer.  In an effort to address these issues CI is working to develop community-based ecotourism projects which will encourage visitors to explore the other attractions of  the Petn.  <P>

<STRONG>The Scarlet Macaw Trail</STRONG>--With the support and participation of local communities, CI Guatemala (ProPetn) and the Ecotourism Program have been developing ecotourism infrastructure to help curb the destruction of  forests within the Maya Biosphere Reserve.   As a result of three years of development, the Scarlet Macaw Trail Tour was launched in May 1996, and is being marketed internationally by many respected ecotour operators.  Led and managed by the inhabitants of the Centro Campesino and El Cruce a Dos Aguadas communities, the ecotour is an ecologically-sensitive excursion through the tropical forest surrounding the El Per archaeological site.  Visitors on the tour will enjoy local interpretation of natural and cultural attractions, including stays with the communities, and sightings of howler monkeys, imperial woodpeckers, and the endangered scarlet macaws.  Besides providing alternative livelihoods for the communities, it is hoped that the presence of tourists along the trail will deter looting of the El Per archaeological site, prevent further agricultural encroachment into the reserve, and eradicate poaching of young scarlet macaws from nesting areas.<P>

<STRONG>The Eco-Escuela de Espanol</STRONG>--Located in the small town of San Andrs on the shores of Lake Petn-Itz, the Eco-Escuela is a Spanish language school with an ecological curriculum for tourists.  Students of the school stay with local families and are encouraged to work on various volunteer activities within the community.  After three years of operation, nearly 700 students have participated in the program, the Eco-Escuela has become fully independent, and is managed by a cooperative of teachers, homestay owners and administrators .  With limited promotional aid from CI, the Eco-Escuela is now a model for an independent community-based ecotourism enterprise.<P>

<STRONG>Center for Information on the Culture, Nature and Arts of the Petn (CINCAP)--</STRONG>Located in the hub of Flores, the region's capital, this center serves as an information clearinghouse for tourists seeking low-impact alternative attractions in the Petn.  CINCAP exhibits local natural and cultural history and highlights regional arts and crafts.  As a center for regional environmental education and training in tourism, the center will work with local communities as well as with tourists. In October 96, it housed a Workshop for CI's enterprise project managers from 14 different countries. <P>

<STRONG>El Mirador Trail</STRONG>--ProPetn has been working with the community of Carmelita to develop infrastructure for tourists visiting the immense ruins of the Maya city of "El Mirador."  Located in northern Petn, the project was initiated to generate sustainable economic alternatives for the community which conserve the natural resources of the area.  An association of local guides has formed a committee to direct tourism activities around Carmelita, including leading expeditions along the El Mirador Route.  The community has recently constructed an eco-camp to host arriving visitors for this five-day interpretive trip.  The camp provides environmentally friendly showers and self-composting toilets to ensure minimal impact on the ecosystem.  The Ecotourism Program will work to link this product with a larger market to increase revenues and jobs and thereby provide even greater protection for the Petn forests.<P>


<STRONG>PERU</STRONG><P>

The tropical forests of Peru contain an enormous variety of habitats and organisms making it one of the world's centers of biological diversity.  Combined with unique cultural attractions such as Machu Picchu, the nation has the potential to be one of the world's premier ecotourism destinations.  Unfortunately, lack of strategic planning to take advantage of these incredible resources has left them open to rapid degradation by environmentally destructive industries, including poorly managed tourism.<P>

<STRONG>Ecotourism Strategy for the Inka Region</STRONG>-- With the support of the Peru United Nations Development Program, CI's Ecotourism Program is working to develop a sustainable tourism development plan for the Inka Region.  Utilizing a unique consensus building approach, the Ecotourism Program is working with stakeholders in the departments of Cusco, Madre de Dios, and Apurimac to produce a practical strategy for ecotourism development in the region. The strategy will include necessary first steps for policy implementation, as well as the identification of  alternative sites, trails, and attractions to ensure that tourism revenues are distributed throughout the region.<P>


<STRONG>SURINAME/GUYANA</STRONG><P>

Located on the northeastern coast of South America, the adjacent countries of Guyana and Suriname still maintain 80% of its surface covered with uninterrupted expanses of tropical forest in the northern reaches of the Amazon Basin.  Due to low population density and shifting political fortunes, there has been virtually no pressures on these forests until recently.  New logging and mining concessions, road construction, insufficient protected areas systems and policies, and lack of economic opportunity, are now posing tremendous threats to the incredible biodiversity of these nations.  
Ecotourism is already a budding economic activity in both of these countries and has tremendous potential to improve income opportunities for local people and promote conservation.  Both Suriname and Guyana have tremendous ecotourism potential due to the cultural diversity of Maroon and Amerindian communities and an array of unique and fantastic natural attractions. Although obstacles to effective development of ecotourism must be overcome, growing political stability creates a situation where tourism can generate considerable foreign exchange and job opportunities. <P>

All CI projects for ecotourism in these nations are in the initial stages.  The Ecotourism Program will work with both Guyana and Suriname in government planning efforts to establish ecotourism policies and guidelines.  Additionally, the Ecotourism Program will be working with the design of facilities and business opportunities in the communities of Kwamala and Asindopo in Suriname, and the development of a unique cultural and rain forest tour with the Nappi community in the Kanuku mountains of Guyana, where scientists have detected the highest population density known for the endangered Harpy Eagle. <P>



<STRONG>BOTSWANA</STRONG><P>

CI's program in Botswana focuses exclusively on the Okavango Delta.  As the world's largest inland delta, protection of the Okavango ecosystem is critical for both the wildlife and the people in the region.  In order to ensure both environmental protection and enhanced economic stability, the CI-Botswana Program is seeking to develop community management of the increasing numbers of tourists coming to the delta.<P>

<STRONG>CI-Botswana Expedition</STRONG>--CI is working with an ecotour operator, Explorers, to develop an unique eco-safari to the Okavango for 1997.  Individuals on the tour will have the opportunity to not only enjoy the wonders of the delta, but will be able to visit project sites with CI-Botswana Director, Karen Ross, and witness first-hand Conservation International's efforts to protect this important ecosystem. New staffing for the program will expand the possibility for ecotourism products. <P>

<STRONG>GHANA</STRONG><P>

The Upper Guinean rainforest block in West Africa is one of the most diverse ecosystems on the continent.  The forest zone in Ghana contains the eastern fifth of this important ecosystem. The CI-Ghana Program is presently focused in the Kakum National Park whose forest elephants, seven species of primates, high antelope and bird diversity provide tremendous potential for ecotourism.   The park will serve as a model in West Africa  for integrated conservation and economic development by combining sound scientific analysis and ecotourism as a sustainable enterprise.   To achieve this goal, CI provides technical assistance for the planning and development of Kakum.  <P>

Early in 1995, CI and the American Society of Landscape Architecture organized a charette for the conceptual design of the Kakum Conservation Area to be developed within the framework established by the Tourism Development Scheme for the Central Region (TODSCER.)  The workshop resulted in designs for a canopy walkway system and a visitor center to enhance tourist experience and understanding of the natural and cultural history of Ghana. <P>

<STRONG>Kakum Canopy Walkway</STRONG>--The first of its kind on the African continent, the Kakum canopy walkway was completed and opened to visitors on Earth Day 1995. Seven suspended walkways extend over some 1,000 feet, attached to six platforms in tall trees, and  allow visitors to experience the rainforest where its biodiversity is at its highest, at heights up to 100 feet . The walkway has greatly increased the numbers of national and international tourists coming to the park: in 1992, fewer than 2000 people visited the park, whereas in 1996 more than 30,000 visitors are expected.   This increase in visitation, while still far below the 70,000 annual visitor capacity, has brought jobs and revenue into the area and demonstrated to local communities the profitability of protecting the park. CI is working in several nearby villages to develop other business alternatives for the population. <P>

<STRONG>Kakum Visitor Center</STRONG>--Although a temporary center currently displays culture and nature exhibits, the planned Kakum Visitor Center will become model for protected areas throughout Ghana and West Africa.  Highlights of  the facilities at Kakum include the innovative use of local materials and crafts in its design, and creative educational exhibits.  Combined with the canopy walkway, this world-class visitor center will attract ecotourists and thereby preserve cultural and natural resources.<P>


<STRONG>MADAGASCAR</STRONG><P>

Madagascar is often considered the highest biodiversity conservation priority on earth.  Its unique evolutionary history has resulted in exceptional species numbers and endemism (species that exist only in a specific ecosystem.)  Because of this fascinating natural history, Madagascar could rival the Galapagos Islands as a natural tourism attraction.   Unfortunately, the island has yet to live up to its promise as an ecotourism destination.  As threats of further deforestation increase, the CI Ecotourism Program is working to develop ecotourism in Madagascar as a means of protecting this natural heritage.<P>

<STRONG>Ankarafantsika Reserve</STRONG>--Located in northwestern Madagascar, the Ankarafantsika Reserve plays a vital role in protecting watersheds and directly supports nearly 20,000 Malagasy whose daily lives depend on the region's rice crops for sustenance.  CI believes that an ecotourism industry focused on Ankarafantsika's rich wildlife will not only promote conservation within the region, but could also be a major source of foreign exchange for Madagascar.  Many of the reserve's lemurs (a primate endemic to the island) are found nowhere else on earth; yet only a handful of lemur watching sites are visited regularly.  Additionally, the reserve houses a research station for an endangered tortoise which is also rarely visited.  The Ecotourism Program is conducting a market survey to determine the best strategies for developing ecotourism in the reserve's buffer zone.  The objective is to provide local communities with a sustainable means for subsistence which will not endanger the natural resources of the reserve, as part of a broader Integrated Conservation and Development Project. <P>

<STRONG>INDONESIA</STRONG><P>

Despite occupying only 1.3% of the earth's land surface, Indonesia has a level of biodiversity which rivals that of Brazil.  The more than 17,000 islands which make up the nation contain the world's largest number of mammal species, over 20,000 plant species, and 17% of the world's bird species.  This natural diversity is matched by Indonesia's cultural diversity.  The population of 180 million have hundreds of distinct cultures and languages.  As the nation experiences rapid economic growth, CI's efforts in Indonesia are focused on strengthening the capacity of Indonesian organizations and establishing successful enterprises to promote the conservation of marine and forest ecosystems.<P>

<STRONG>Togian Islands</STRONG>--The Togian Islands of Central Sulawesi have extraordinary potential in ecotourism and an unique opportunity to promote an integrated conservation program for both terrestrial and marine ecosystems.  Diving and snorkeling options in the Togians are exceptional, and the islands themselves host a wide array of endemic fauna attractions.  As large-scale tourism development is a realistic threat, CI has been working with the District Tourism Agency to ensure sound planning of conservation areas and tourism zones.  In 1996, the Ecotourism Program will be working on capacity building, product development, and international marketing for the Togian Islands.<P>

<STRONG>INDECON</STRONG>--The Indonesian Ecotourism Network (INDECON) was established in 1995 by the Institute for Indonesian Tourism Studies, in association with Bina Swadaya tours and CI.  This non-profit organization publishes a newsletter on Indonesian ecotourism issues and hosts monthly seminars which are attended by a variety of local NGOs, the Indonesian government, USAID,  and in-county tour operators.  The Ecotourism Program continues to act as a special advisor to INDECON, and will aid them in their efforts to support Indonesian ecotourism projects and develop different training modules for guides, tour operators, and developers of ecotourism products. <P>

<STRONG>Gunung Gede Pangrango National Park</STRONG> --Located only an hour away from Jakarta, Gunung Gede park receives hundreds of thousands of annual visitors, and offers a tremendous opportunity to disseminate information to both visiting locals and tourists on issues important to conservation in Indonesia.  The park protects two mountainous formations with unique fauna and flora, and CI is working with a consortium for the development of tourist infrastructure at the site, including a canopy walkway and a visitor center.<P>


<STRONG>PAPUA NEW GUINEA</STRONG><P>

Papua New Guinea (PNG) is the largest country in Melanesia, and is one of the most biologically and culturally diverse nations in the world.  It contains the Old World s greatest expanses of forests, mangroves, and reefs that still thrive in a largely pristine condition.  PNG's wealth in biological diversity is matched by an unrivaled cultural diversity with over 700 distinct languages. <P>

Over the past five years, the PNG highlands have developed into one of the most popular cultural ecotourism destinations in the world.  However, if ecotourism in PNG is to prosper, the  Ecotourism Program believes that it is the responsibility of all tourism operators and other stakeholders involved in tourism to ensure that their products are environmentally sensitive and contribute to the conservation of the natural and cultural resources.  To meet this objective, the Ecotourism Program seeks to increase local capacity to improve existing ecotourism and to develop additional sites outside of the PNG highlands.<P>

<STRONG>Community-based Ecotourism Planning Workshop</STRONG>--In collaboration with the Ecoplan:net Institute and the PNG Tourism Promotion Authority, CI held an ecotourism workshop in July of 1996.  The workshop effectively introduced thirty PNG tourism professionals to the essential components that are required to develop a successful ecotourism venture.  Based on the model provided by the ecotourism workshops in Brazil, this process will provide participants with relevant ecotourism planning skills and the ability to share these skills with other communities and members of the travel industry.<P>

<STRONG>Lakekamu Basin</STRONG>--The Lakekamu Basin, an incredible tract of lowland rain forest surrounded by hills and high mountains, supports approximately  2,000 people in several village settlements near the basin's major rivers.  Most of this area is rarely, if ever, visited, and thus constitutes a near-pristine natural destination with high conservation potential. Timber agents continue to look at the area for large-scale logging.  Working with all four of the major land-owning peoples, CI has been developing tourism enterprises in the Basin.  A trek through the spectacular gorge county up to the Kuper Range field station has been mapped out and maps for shorter hikes along an old World War II road next to the beautiful Avi-avi river are being developed for a softer ecotour.  CI is working with the Biara and Kovio peoples to develop two simple lodges for tourists to the Basin.  With natural attractions including tree kangaroos, the southern cassowary, and numerous species of birds of paradise, these ecotourism initiatives provide the first promise of a sustainable alternative in the Lakekamu Basin.<P>


<STRONG>PHILIPPINES</STRONG><P>

Although over 95% of its forested area has been lost, the Philippine archipelago has the highest levels of endemism in the Indo-Malayan realm.  CI's efforts in the Philippines focus on preserving the last remaining tracts of forest on the islands of Luzon, Palawan and Mindanao, and on protecting the incredible marine richness along the coast of the nation.  Due to the fact that subsistence use is a major cause of  destruction in both of these ecosystems, along with destructive technologies like dynamite and cyanide fishing, CI's work in the Philippines emphasizes the development of  conservation enterprises such as ecotourism.<P>

<STRONG>St. Paul's and El Nido National Parks, Palawan</STRONG>-- Both St. Paul's National Park and El Nido National Park receive thousands of tourists, attracted by the unique underwater river that runs along the coast of Palawan and the haunting limestone formations that characterize the coast.  However, tourists to the area currently come with city tour operators for day visits, resulting in little or no benefit for the local communities.  To address this issue, the Ecotourism Program will be working to build the local capacity for tourism and develop ecotourism products to help the communities around St. John National Park and El Nido National park benefit from the tourism coming to their area.<P>

<STRONG>Tubbataha Reefs National Marine Park, Palawan</STRONG>--The Tubbataha Reefs National Marine Park is a World Heritage site located in the open sea, close to the island of Palawan, and its conservation is already a priority for the local diving community.  Keidenren, a Japanese foundation, is funding a broad conservation plan to be developed by a presidential Task Force with CI as a leading member.  <P.

<STRONG>Palanan</STRONG>--In 1992, CI identified ecotourism as a potential sustainable enterprise in Palanan, located in the Sierra Madre Mountains of Northern Luzon, northern Philippines.  This area was rated by consultants from Mountain Travel/Sobek and The Ecoplan:net Institute as an attractive regional and international destination.  The consultants then developed a carrying capacity plan and itineraries for varying interests were for Palanan.  The Ecotourism Program has been involved with training of nature guides and other tourism service providers, and is looking to expand its efforts in facilitating Palanan's entry into international ecotourism markets.<P>


<STRONG>SOLOMON ISLANDS</STRONG></STRONG><P>

The Solomon Islands are a double chain of islands which extend eastward from Papua New Guinea and presently maintain 80% of the land covered in tropical forest.  The country sustains high levels of endemism due to its remote location, however, forest and marine ecosystem degradation caused by the timber industry are becoming significant concerns for the islands biodiversity conservation.  As the majority of tourists to the Solomon Islands are divers, the Ecotourism Program strategy involves developing an ecotourism product which would highlight the forest ecosystem and island culture as an additional attraction for a stay on the islands.<P>

<STRONG>Makira Island</STRONG>--Working through the Solomon Islands Development Trust, CI has developed a model of community-based ecotourism.  Tours to Makira Island include a trek through the cloud forest of the highlands, a visit to the rural community at Hauta,  and a stay with the hill top people of Hunama.  Only four trips a year are planned, as the communities would like tourism to provide them with much needed currency, but not impact their daily routines.  In 1996, the Ecotourism Program will be looking to link the local tour operator with a greater international market, to increase the revenues from the enterprise and thereby provide an alternative to destructive logging and unsustainable harvesting of marine products. <P>

Hi,<P>

I'm Dwayne Knox and I work with the Newton County Resource
Council, in 
the Boston Mountain Range of the Ozark Mountains of Northern
Arkansas, on 
the headwaters of the Buffalo River. We are located on the highest 
uplands between the Rocky Mountains and the Appalachians, and have
the 
highest waterfall between them too. Most of our county is managed
by the 
U.S Forest Service as the Buffalo Ranger District of the Ozark
National 
Forest, or by the National Park Service as the Buffalo National
River. 
The entire river is undamned and free flowing, and is in under
federal 
management from the headwaters to the mouth. We have a large Elk
herd and 
a large number of Black Bear. The more remote southern half of our
county 
has a population density of about 7 people per square mile, and
contains 
four Wilderness Areas. The Census Bureau considers our county 100%
rural.<P>


The Newton County Resource Council and the Ecotourism Project <P>

The Ecotourism Project is a program of the Newton County Resource 
Council, (NCRC), a nonprofit community development corporation.
Since 
1987 NCRC has worked to improve the quality of life in Newton County 
while preserving and enhancing the county's traditions, values and 
natural resources.  NCRC's other current projects include Harmony
House, 
a shelter for victims of domestic violence, Project Care, an adult
day 
care center, Bradley Park, a ten acre park on the Little Buffalo
River, 
Summer Youth Program, a six week-day camp for elementary aged
children, 
Healthy Families Arkansas providing information for new parents,
and the 
Newton County Single Parent Scholarship Fund.<P>

NCRC is committed through grassroots organizing, training, and
leadership 
development to empowering low-income people to be part of the
solution to 
the pervasive poverty in Newton County.  The county's $10,406 per
capita 
income rates last of the 75 Arkansas counties, per capita retail
sales 
are $750 and 52% of the county's workforce are employed outside the 
county.  The Ozark National Forest and the Buffalo National River
manage 
59% of the county's 822 square miles.<P>

In late 1991 NCRC began the VISTA community economic development
project 
to study sectors of the economy which would stimulate job
opportunities 
for low-income families.  Ecotourism was chosen in 1993 as it
combines 
magnificent scenery, bountiful natural resources, rich cultural
heritage 
and the diverse backgrounds, talents and knowledge of local people.  
Ecotourism seeks to preserve the qualities of life that make Newton 
County unique.<P>

Establishing ecotourism in Newton County calls for dialogue, 
experimentation, imagination, collaboration and alliances.
Ecotourism  
funding is provided by The National Corporation for Community
Service, 
the Winthrop Rockefeller Foundation, the Campaign for Human
Development, 
and the Foundation for the Mid-South.  The  Ozark National Forest, 
Buffalo National River and Arkansas Game and Fish resource
managers are 
committed partners.  Ozark Ecotours gives you an opportunity to
become 
part of a community economic development that filters out the harmful 
side effects of irresponsible tourism while striving for job creation 
that is economically viable, ecologically sound and socially just.<P>

Ecotourism, Newton County style uses the skills, talents and
knowledge of 
local people to promote activities that share the county's natural 
resources and cultural heritage.  The number of visitors is kept
to no 
more than fifteen, and activities are dispersed throughout the
county and 
throughout the year, ensuring that fragile ecological and historic
sites 
are not "loved to death."   Ecotour sites are monitored for the 
accumulated impact of tourism and collected data is shared with
federal 
and state resource managers.  Job creation barriers are removed by
the 
project providing land use permits, liability insurance, access to 
transportation, advertising and booking and one-on-one assistance
in tour 
development.  Already existing small businesses providing lodging,
arts 
and crafts,  food and retail services are utilized and promoted.<P>

The project staff and VISTA volunteers are assisted in
implementing the 
program by the Ecotourism Advisory Team which meets bi-monthly and
its 
steering committee of nine meets monthly to:<BR>
* plan and develop goals which meets low-income needs. <BR>
*assure that the program conforms to the values of ecotourism and 
preservation of cultural and natural resources.<BR>
*evaluate the program and report to the NCRC board on its progress.<BR>
*foster involvement and leadership skills of project participants. <BR>
*reach out to the community to inform and involve county residents. <P>

The Ecotourism Project of NCRC is community economic development
which 
strives to be economically viable, ecologically sound and socially
just 
in a NCRC's Ecotourism Project is seeking to filter out the
harmful side 
effects of irresponsible tourism while preserving what it has to
offer 
visitors to the benefits of its residents.  We hope that you will
come 
and share what is a very special place in the natural state.<P>

NCRC carries out its activities on a very low budget derived from 
foundation, church, corporation, federal state and individual donors.<P>

East Asia respectively. The people around that area are suffering
(have been
suffering since 1976) from some kind of health difficulty. We have

I am a 30 year old Environmental Studies undergraduate student at the 
University of Vermont in Burlington, Vermont, USA.  My background is in 
the field of backcountry human waste management.<P>

1) I am a 1995 and 1997 National Security Scholar and will be returning 
to Nepal for continued language study and research of water and 
wastewater issues.  In the Spring of 1995, I completed a report on human 
waste management in Mt. Everest National Park.  This report included 
analyzing two solar-assisted toilets located in the Park.  The report is 
available in full-test (and with photos) at my web site below.<P>

In the Spring of 1997, I plan to conduct a watershed sanitary survey (as 
outlined by the American Water Works Association, AWWA) in Mt. Everest 
National Park to analyze potential water quality problems and recommend a 
management plan.<P>

2) In the summer and fall of 1996, I worked with the United States Forest 
Service Technology and Development Center in San Dimas, California 
designing a passive solar cooker to pasteurize the compost removed from 
backcountry toilets at Yosemite National Park, California, USA.  We 
demonstrated that the end-product from these toilets could be safely 
treated on-site and that all Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 
regulations could be met.  I also have experience dealing with 
high-altitude treatment and disposal of human waste including field work 
at Mt Rainier National Park, Washington, USA studying techniques for 
human waste dehydration and the current blue bag policy (for climbers to 
pack-out their waste).  <P>

3) Following a literature search and field site visits of various waste 
treatment systems, I designed a working composting toilet system at Crag 
Camp on Mt. Adams, NH, USA (el. 4,270 ft).  This facility is located in 
the alpine zone of the Presidential Range in the Appalachian Mountains 
and is subject to extreme weather conditions.<P>

I am happy to share information about my experiences with sanitation in 
mountain environments and would appreciate guidance to any available 
information regarding my up-coming research in the Mt. Everest region 
relating to past water quality issues in the Park.<P>

Hello, my  name is Charles Little. I am a civil engineer working
in the
field of 
rural area water supply and sanitation for the Navajo people in
southwestern 
United States. Surprisingly, many Navajo people are without adequate 
drinking water.  I have worked at this position for both the
Navajo and 
Tohono O'dham people, of southern Arizona,  since 1984. Before that I 
studied at Pennsylvania State University for four years.<P>

The highlight of my life so far, hence the interest in sustainable
development 
for mountain ecosystems, was a two year Peace Corps experience in
Nepal. 
In 1977, I was with the first and last group of rural area water
supply 
surveyors for Peace Corps Nepal. Peace Corps later decided that it
was a 
good position for an extended volunteer instead of a new volunteer
because 
the position required good language skills and also was a rather
rewarding 
position.  The position was rewarding because the villagers,
hoping to get 
water piped near their home, always would treat the Saab surveyor
well; 
feeding them either chicken meat, eggs, raksi, or yogurt. Besides
that, the 
surveyor got to travel quite extensively as I did through most of
eastern 
Nepal. I also spent three weeks in Argakanchi District southwest
of Pokhara.<P>

Nowadays, we live in Flagstaff, Arizona,  a mountain community in
northern 
Arizona. The community is nestled among a Ponderosa Pine forests
which 
used to have logging as one of the main industries. Since then and
for a
variety 
of reasons, logging is no more a viable industry. Flagstaff is now
a bustling 
university, Northern Arizona University, and tourist town.
Tourism is 
popular especially during the summer because its proximity to the
Grand 
Canyon and the Native American reservations. <P>

Thank you to the Mountain Institute in their efforts to extend the
dialogue to 
all of us out here. <P>

working with the Navajo American Indian communities of  Northern
Arizona as a rural development specialist.  I recently returned to
Nepal to share my  forest ecosystem management and economic
development experiences with the Nepali rural communities.<P>
The major areas of my interest while I was in Northern Arizona has been
introduction of community based natural resource management based on
community forestry principles and establishment of cultural and
ecotourism in the Navajo Indian Reservation communities.
At present, Navajo communities, similar to the many communities of
developing nations, are concerned with local empowerment, cultural
preservation, and sustainable development.  The Arizona American
Indian Tourism Association have been established to  promote
community based environmentally acceptable, culturally appropriate,
and economically sustainable tourism programs.  One of the main
challenges faced by the native communities of Northern Arizona is
how to promote tourism industries that promotes local community
empowerment while maintaining highest priority to the preservation of
natural wonders and endangered native traditions.<P> This is all for now
and I hope to share more discussions pertinent to tourism development
in natural resource depended indigenous communities soon.<P>

I have been working for the Florida Division of Historical Resources,
Bureau of Archaeological Research (BAR) in Tallahassee, Florida, since
February 1994. I have worked on several major research projects for BAR.<BR>
The most significant of these were: (1) a management plan for Florida's
Submerged Cultural Resources (shipwrecks and other inundated heritage sites), funded by the Coastal Zone Management Program; and (2) a study of US Navy shipwrecks in Florida waters, funded by the U.S. Dept. of Defense Legacy Program. Although my work has had little to do with mountain preservation, I have been gradually broadening my natural and cultural heritage management perspective! The recent IUCN World Conservation Congress in Montreal, provided me with an excellent overview of developments in many fields of heritage preservation. There were many excellent presentations concerning mountain preservation at the Congress.  Dr. Larry Hamilton, and his wife Linda, of the Islands and Highlands Environmental Consultancy, tirelessly organized the mountain preservation sessions at the Conference. They also organized a delicious "mountain preservation" dinner which was well attended! I hope to continue to develop my career in heritage management, such as with World Heritage Sites and historic parks. I would like to follow on-going developments with heritage corridors, greenways, and mountain preservation, as part of my career growth. I look forward to being a part of the Mountain Forum.<BR>

Re: wolf depredation case study<P>

  My
name is Jeff McCusker, and I'm currently working as a consultant on a
long-term contract for the Peace Corps in Mongolia, setting up a new
program in envrionmental protection.  We currently have 3 volunteers
working in protected areas here, and 6 more should be coming this
summer.<P>

I am trying to put together a two week inservice training course for
the volunteers and their counterparts, (Mongolian biologists, and
resource specialists working for the Protected Area Bureau here).  I've
been thinking that an intensive case study in setting up and
implementing a monitoring program might be a good exercise, if it
involves a lot of practical field work.  One of the common management
issues at all three protected areas, is livestock depredation by
wolves.  The park service here needs lots of assistance with carrying
out scientific studies, planning monitoring activities, and
predator-prey ecology.  If you have the time, and would be interested
in giving me some advice, let me know, and I'll send you some info on
what I'm considering doing.  We are looking for technical assistance on
designing and planning the training.  If you or your organization would
be interested, let me know also.  The training would probably be held
in early May of this year.<P>

Greetings.<P>

I am Don Messerschmidt, a PhD Anthropologist (Univ. of Oregon
1974), who has 
worked extensively in the Himalayas both as a social science
researcher and 
development adviser and consultant. <P>

My anthropological interests in mountains are partly demonstrated
in a 
2-part article in Mountain Research and Development entitled "Hindu 
Pilgrimage to Muktinath, Nepal" (in 2 parts; 1989, v.9,
no.2:89-118). (I am 
also on the editorial board of this journal.)<P>

I have also published a book on the Gurungs, a Himalayan ethnic
group, and 
on many subjects dealing with the culture and societies of mountain 
peoples... Two collections are now out from Bibliotheca Himalayica
(EMR 
Publishing House, Kathmandu): one on development studies, the
other on 
ethnic groups.<P>

My development/consulting interests are focused on natural resources 
management, especially social forestry. I have a number of
publications in 
this field. My most recent sojourn to the Himalayas was on a
consultancy for 
the Australian Government (which funds one of the finest community
forestry 
development projects in the Himalayan mid-hills), to determine the 
feasibility of extending the community forestry/user group management 
approach to the highest altitude forests. I led the team of
foresters and 
social scientists over a 4-months period. Great high altitude
trekking and 
research! The work was conducted using rapid and participatory
assessment 
techniques (both for forest profile transects and village
interviews and 
observations). I have developed a special expertise in the use of
rapid 
appraisal for such purposes.<P>

I was raised in the mountains of SE Alaska at Juneau. I currently
live on 
the fringe of the Cascades, in Vancouver, Washington (near
Portland, OR).<P>

strong environmental credentials, as my PhD. work in economics
relates 
more to applied microeconomics and history of political economy.  
However, in the past year I have been working to develop some
areas of 
research interest in environmental economics, and business and the 
environment.  I tend to lurk on some of these environmental
discussion 
lists, not contributing much but actively monitoring the threads of 
discussion.  I am a native of the mountains of Southwestern
Virginia, so 
my interest was piqued when I saw the post announcing this list.  For 
those of you with some knowledge to share, what are the "hot" issues 
right now?  What special attention or expertise is required by
mountain

Dear forumnites,<P>
I am a 36 years old researcher. I am working at the University of Turin and
I am a forester.<P>
My scientific interest are in three topics strictly related:<P>

- Forest-wildlife relationships in the mountain forests. Wild ungulates
impact on the forest regeneration process and on the dynamics of the
subalpine forests, wildlife requirements relative to forest stands.<BR>

- Silviculture and Ecology of the mountain forests. Disturbance history,
regeneration process, silvicultural methods in alpine subalpine forests. <BR>

- Dendroecology at upper forest limits.<P>

I am working in the Italian alpine environment both in the western and in
the eastern Alps and I'm involved in regional and European projects. I am
looking for connections with people that work on the same subjects in other mountain areas (especially Himalaya and  Andes) for information exchange, visits and new projects.<P>

I am Malcolm (Mac) Odell, with The Mountain Institute's Makalu-Barun
National Park & Conservation Area Project (MBCP), working with Brian
Peniston (Nepal) and Bob Davis and Gabriel Campbell(US) from whom
Forum members have already heard.  My duties now are to support field
operations, particularly those related to community development, cultural
conservation, and eco-tourism.  These are three areas that we see as integrally
related to our tasks of advancing mountain cultures and protecting mountain
environments.  Personally, I also see these to be three key components in
addressing the issues at the heart of this dialog on 'paying for the mountains.'<P>

 Previously I served as a Peace Corps volunteer in Nepal, 1962-67,
including two y ears when I was fortunate enough to be the first
volunteer posted in the high mountains, living for 2 years in Solu-Khumbu
when it was an exceedingly poor, remote, and seldom visited area.  I think
some 65 travelers made it to Namche during the year I lived there. Seeing the
potential for tourism, and believing that it should be controlled directly
by the local people, I also helped arrange training in Switzerland
for the first Sherpa eco-tourism entrepreneur, who later started the first
Nepali-owned trekking agency.<P>

Hello everyone,<P>

My name is Bikash Pandey. I am currently a student at the Energy &
Resources
Program at UC Berkeley. I am from Nepal and have been working
there for the
last ten years to promote rural electrification through village level
micro-hydro schemes. I first worked with the Development and
Consulting
Services out of Butwal and later with the Intermediate Technology
Development Group in Kathmandu. Recently, I was also involved as
part of an
NGO "Alliance for Energy" in campaigning against the Arun III
hydroelectric
project proposed in Eastern Nepal.<P>


I am interested in ways to help mountain communities (in the
Himalayas and
else where) become self sufficient in clean, renewable energy. One key
aspect of this is finding creative funding mechanisms to make this
happen;
another is encouraging government policies that are conducive to
this; and
yet a third is having access to appropriate technologies. I am
interested in
all three and would particularly like to hear the experience of
others that
work on issues of energy in mountain communities.<P>

From: pob266@pobox.infomark.it <P>

I am a 27 years old geomorphologist graduated in Milan (Italy) in July 1994. 
Since I graduated I have been working in geoenvironmental topics in mountain
areas; in particular my interests are in geoenvironmental hazards forecasting
and geomorphological mapping. These interests have roots both in my passion
in mountain, snow, alpinism, and in my concerning in nature observation. <P>

During my master thesis research I spent two years in the Central Alps. The
aim of the research was to assess and map permafrost occurrence in mountain
regions. To achieve this aim I made use of several methodologies employing
both direct (e.g. holes) and indirect (e.g. geophysics, Basal Temperature of
Snow cover measurements, temperature of springs...) measurements. The
research was conducted both in winter and in summer time. I spent long
periods at altitude higher than 2500 a.s.l. in glacial and periglacial
environment where, with a colleague of mine, I carried out field
measurements in and around several rockglaciers. <BR>
This direct contact with such environment led me to go further in
geomorphological research and in exploration in mountain regions of  other
countries, and I seized the opportunity to work with Professor Petru Urdea
of the University of Timisoara, Romania, thanks to a grant provided by the
Italian Foreign Affairs Ministry. In Romania I faced a culture with
different cultural and historical tradition; there I projected and carried
through a research designed to find a relation on regional scale between air
temperature annual trends and ground temperature in the Carpathians. In
spite of the poor resources available I achieved successful results
cooperating with local scholars in a friendly and highly motivated team with
whom I am still in contact. <P>

>From April to October 1996, I worked in Belgium within the research team of
the Agricultural Engineering Land Management Laboratory (RVL) in Gent. At
RVL I computed a model for soil erosion assessment making use of GIS
technologies, whose final report on the complete procedure followed I can
send on request. This experience allowed me acquire skills in mastering
ARC/INFO, ARC/VIEW, IDRISI and some database software systems as DB IV and
ACCESS. <BR>
During November, December and part of January I collaborated with Remote
Sense Data Engineering, a company which develops a specific GIS software
package called Cartha and which makes use of remote sensed data.<P>

I am particularly eager to widen my experience in geoenvironmental hazards
assessment in mountain regions making use of GIS techniques, remote and
field data capture. I would like to be involved in a long-term research
within a research team.<BR>
My sojourns in both European and non-European countries have fostered my
enthusiasm in collaborating with different cultures I and have strengthened
my collaboration skills. <P>

That's all!<BR>
Best Regards, Jacopo.<P>

Hola!<P> I am writing from Quito Ecuador. I am an anthropologist from 
Peru, working in Ecuador since January 1994 as coordinator of the 
"Programa en Sociadades de Montan~a y Desarrollo Sustentable" at the 
Facultad Latinoamericana de Ciencias Sociales (FLACSO-Ecuador). I 
work as part of a 6 persons team that works in mountain sites in 4 
protected areas that include large portions of high altitude 
mountains. Our team works in each one of these site as part of larger 
consortiums and programs of research and development.<P>

Before coming to Ecuador I worked for the International Potato Center 
(CIP) in Lima, Peru, in a project devoted to promoting potato 
seed multiplication schemes for small farmers in different Andean 
regions of Peru.  For my doctoral dissertation I had 
the fortune of working in a gorgeous mountain region of 
southeastern Peru (3,500 - 4,500 masl), close to the Bolivian border, 
studying the connections between traditional agriculture and off-farm 
income produced by migration to gold mines.<P>

I was born in the FLAT lands of the Peruvian desert but I have now 
spent most of my professional life at high altitudes enjoying these 
great skies and views... Looking forward to join the discussion

(My name is Roca, Delfi Roca.  I am a 36 year old man and I live in the Pyrenees, the natural frontier between France and Spain in a  country called Andorra (470 km2).  Our official language is catalan.)<P>

Trabajo como director de una ONG de proteci&oacute;n de los animales, las 
plantas y el medio ambiente llamada APAPMA. Contamos con unos 900 
socios para una poblaci&oacute;n en el pa&iacute;s de 55.000 habitantes.<P>

(I work as director of an NGO that works to protect animals, plants and the environment.  It is called APAPMA.  We have 900 colleagues for a country populated with 55,000 people.)<P>

Uno de mis mayores deseos es conseguir que un  desarrollo sostenible 
efectivo para las zonas de monta&ntilde;a sea una realidad lo mas pronto 
posible. La experiencia andorrana en este sentido es totalmente 
negativa. recibimos la visita, por motivos comerciales de 8 millones 
de turistas al a&ntilde;o. Es un buen ejemplo de como no deben hacerse
muchas 
cosas. Es, por tanto, una base de datos de errores a evitar por otras 
comunidades que no est&eacute;n en el nivel de desarrollo economico de la 
nuestra, si aspiran a ello.<P>

(One of my biggest wishes is the attainment of sustainable development for mountain regions as soon as possible.  The Andorran experience is totally negative.  We receive tourists, for commercial reasons, of 8 million people each year.  It's a good example of how many things should not be done.   There are many mistakes that could be avoided by other communities that are not at the same economic level as ours, but who aspire to get there.)<P>

Estar&eacute; leyendo vuestros mensajes y intentar&eacute; dar mi opinion si veo
que 
en alguna experiencia se corre el peligro de equivocarse como hicimos 
nosotros, aunque nuestro ejemplo es muy dif&iacute;&oacute;cil de reproducir en
otros 
lugares del planeta.<P>

(I will be reading your messages and I will intend to give my opinion if I see the danger in making a mistake that we have made, although our example is very difficult to reproduce in other places on the planet.)<P>

Escribo en castellano porque, aunque lo leo, escribiendo mi ingl&eacute;s no 
es muy correcto, y me ofrezco para ayudar los mails en castellano, si 
a Elyzabeth o Lynelle les parece bien.<P>

(I write in castellano because, althouigh I read English, I have more trouble writing it.  I offer my services to help with Spanish-speaking members if Elizabeth and Lynelle think that is a good idea).<P>

From: Jamie Ross  3jdr6@qlink.queensu.ca
<P>
My name is Jamie Ross and I'm a Master's student in the Department of
Geography at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, Canada. My work is
centred on an analysis of the processes and rates of sediment transport
and deposition in a middle mountain watershed in the Nepal Himalaya. I
have spent two field seasons in the Phewa Tal watershed over the past year
looking at the impacts of monsoon vs. non-monsoon weather conditions on
processes of sediment mobilisation, transport and delivery to the
reservoir. The study has involved the collection of numerous sediment core
samples, discharge data, and lake water column data in order to determine
the relationships between climate, river discharge, suspended sediment
loads, lake stratification and mixing patterns and sedimentation.<p>

Aside from research, my interests in mountain environments lie in
recreation in the form of climbing, trekking etc. I am
fortunate in that I will be able to combine these interests in an 
"environmental expedition" to Mt. Everest in the spring of '98. The
purpose of the expedition will be to remove much of the waste accumulating
at base camp and those camps above it, that has been left by previous
expeditions. Work will also be aimed at assessing the current situation at
base camp and implementing alternatives that will help to mitigate the
presently severe ecological impacts that arise as a result of large
numbers of climbers and trekkers visiting each year.<p>

I look forward to becoming involved in discussions with other forum
members and would welcome anyone who is interested to contact me regarding
research, recreation or both.<p>

Sincerely,<p>

Jamie Ross

From: paul@dobrich.uspc.bg <P>
                                         
I am a US Peace Corps volunteer working on business development in
Bulgaria.
I do extensive work with the tourist industry here and have
numerous contacts.

Before you fumble for an atlas, Bulgaria is located north of
Greece, west of
Turkey, south of Romania and east of Yugoslavia (but no wars
here). It has a
lovely coastline on the Black Sea. It has spectacular moutains. It
has a
communist past, for those interested in politics. It has a much
older and more
forgotten past dating to 6,000 BC. It has played a significant
though little
studied part in all civilization, including if not especially
Western Civ.
It has a fascinating culture, varied geography and unique place in
history.
It has a stable political situation with no threat of armed violence.
It is seeking cooperation with the Western world in many ways. It
has an
unstable economy but that serves you well as it makes dollars and
other hard
currency *very* attractive and very strong. Stronger every day.

There are many tourism possibilities here, from conventional
vacations at
seaside resorts to truly wilderness excursions to cultural and
academic trips.
In the first instance, I cannot sugar-coat the resorts: this is
not Club Med,
though Club Med does own a resort very near where I work and sends
thousands of
French tourists here every year. Bulgarian resorts are nice but a
little dated
in their accoutrements. If you want the Hyatt, don't come here.
But if you want
to see someplace truly interesting on many levels -- and on the
cheap --
book your flights now. As far as other options, these become ever more
attractive as those interested in somewhat more adventurous
tourism are less
likely to mind missing a few stars in the rating. Some ideas for
which I have
*real* contacts ready to do business:<P>

-- archeological tours. the oldest necropolis in the world (I am
told) is
within a 20-minute drive from my office; there are Turkish, Roman,
Thracian
and older ruins dating to civilizations the layperson does not
understand.
there are expert academics waiting to show off their treasures.<BR>
-- wilderness trips. from canoe trips (on fairly placid rivers
through grand
gorges, past castles and amongst charming villages) to hunting
trips (gun, bow
and photo) to survival camps, there are excellently trained people
here calling
me weekly to find out what we can arrange. make a suggestion and
we can find
a way.<BR>
-- cultural tourism. this country is officially more than 1,300
years old.<P>
Though there are aspects of life here that are frustrating, there
are also
things to see and learn. fascinating details stemming from
700-plus years of
occupation (Bulgarians shake their heads for "yes" because the
Muslim Ottoman
Turks used to question the Bulgarians' faith by asking if they
were Christian
while holding a sabre pointed up beneath their chins; nodding
"yes" was not
a survival strategy) make this a trove of discoveries of which
Westerners
know little. if you like, we can send you off the beaten path to
villages
and hamlets where the way of life hasn't changed in hundreds of years,
despite numerous conquerors.<P>

I could go on and I will if you like but I am pushing both space
limits and
your attention spans. Suffice to say if you are interested in
something out
of the ordinary that will teach you more than you imagined and at
little
real cost, this is an excellent opportunity. And not as blind a
lead as it
might sound because I will do what I can to guarantee these
arrangements are
all safe, legitimate and worthwhile. I am trying to help development;
my carelessness for a moment could undo years of work and I know that.<P>

Curious about any of the above? Feel free to write early and often.<P>

Thanks for your patience,<BR>

Here's a few words about myself.<P>

I am currently asst. prof. ('adjunkt') at the Department of 
Ethnography and Social Anthropology at Aarhus University in Denmark. 
A Dutch citizen, I received my Ph.D. this spring from Cornell 
University for a dissertation on contemporary Ladakhi politics and 
development entitled 'Identity Fetishism and the Art of 
Representation'.<P>

Since 1985 I have been engaged in research and have worked with NGOs 
in the Ladakh region of Jammu and Kashmir in the Western Himalaya. My 
current research interests continue to focus on issues related to 
social and economic change, 'sustainable development', and the 
politics of identity in Ladakh and the wider Himalayan region.<P>

More specifically, I am interested in the implications of the 
changing location of Ladakh (as locally and externally perceived, 
through infrastructural and 'virtual' linking, positioning, and 
embedding) for processes and practices of development and livelihoods in 
general, and local and extra-local responses to and involvement in such 
changes (e.g. through politics, representation, formulations of 
demands and strategies, etc.).<P>

I strive to combine my academic pursuits with more immediately 
engaged and policy-oriented practices, generally of a less formal 
nature.<P>

I look forward to participating in discussions and activities related 
to the Mountain Forum.<P>

Dear Mountain Forum Members,<P>

My name is Tom Warren. I am an American living in Norway, and I am the
director of the University of Oslo/University of Bergen's Mountain Research
Station at Finse in the central part of southern Norway. <P>

My interest in mountains began in the Appalachian Mountains of North
Carolina (USA) where I grew up, continued in the Rockies in western Montana
(USA) where I completed my B.Sc. in wildlife biology at the Univ. of
Montana, and is now focused primarily on the mountains of Northern Europe,
especially those here in Norway, where I've completed an M.Sc. and Ph.D. in
terrestrial ecology and zoology, respectively.<P>

Much of my work/interest is in the area of resource management, which of
course includes many human dimensions. I've worked mostly on predation on
livestock by large carnivores (in Norway that means brown bear, wolverine,
wolf and lynx), as well as conflicts between wild reindeer hunters/managers
and sheep grazing interests in the mountains of southern Norway. As the
director of the mountain research station, I am fortunate to live and work
for long periods above the treeline (which in Norway at 60 degrees N is
"only" 1000-1200 a.s.l.).<P>

I look forward to participating in the Mountain Forum.<P>

<P>
<H3>Recommendations of NGOs and mountain  populations
to governments and to the European Union</H3>
<P><H3>
These recommendations were issued by the European NGO
Consultation on Sustainable Mountain Development which took place in
Toulouse, France, on 4-7 July 1996, in the framework of the implementation
of Agenda 21, Chapter 13.</H3><P>
<STRONG>Considering :</STRONG>
<UL>
<LI> the term sustainable development, defined in the report of the world
commission for environment and development (Brundtland report) as
"development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the
ability of future generations to meet their own needs" ;
<LI> the importance of mountains in the global ecosystem, as a source of
water, energy and biological diversity, and a source of such key resources
as minerals, forest and agricultural products and of recreational
opportunity ;
<LI> that about 10 per cent of the world's population depends directly on
mountain resources, and a much larger percentage draws on mountain
resources ;
<LI> the characteristics and specific problems of mountain regions, in terms
of economic difficulties and the fragility of the environment (altitude,
relief, climatic conditions...) ;
<LI> the diversity of mountains at a European scale ;
<LI> the commitment of governments to act in favour of sustainable development
of mountain regions, formalised in chapter 13 of Agenda 21 arising from the
conference of Rio in 1992, and the present intergovernmental working
process leading up to the world conference on mountain areas in 1997 .
</UL><P>
<STRONG>Taking into account :</STRONG>
<P>
<UL>
<LI> the European Consultation by the means of a questionnaire which had been
translated in 16 languages and sent to more than 5000 NGOs in 45 European
countries, and, in particular, the response rate of nearly 19 %, reflecting
the major interest of NGOs and populations in the subject of sustainable
mountain development ;
<LI> the opinions and wishes expressed, and in particular :
<LI> that the majority of the NGOs consider that nothing has changed since the
conference of Rio, concerning mountain regions ;
<LI> that the most efficient defenders of mountain interests are the
inhabitants and the NGOs, and that they are badly represented in the
decision making bodies of European countries ;
<LI> that sustainable mountain development needs first and foremost a
concerted action between all actors involved, and interregional and
international cooperation, especially in the case of transborder massifs ;
<LI> that specific laws for mountains should be created where they do not exist ;
<LI> that human activity may cause considerable damage to the environment in
mountain areas, and that the current measures for environmental protection
are insufficient ;
<LI> that the road system in mountain areas is considered for the most part
adequate or satisfactory.
</UL><P>
<STRONG>
Taking into account the results of the survey of concerned NGOs and
populations of all European countries, the delegates of the Conference on
Sustainable Mountain Development which took place in Toulouse, France, on
4-7 July 1996, representing a range of interests from across society
(associations for nature protection, socio-professional organisations,
cultural and sporting associations...) and coming from 24 European
countries,
recommend the following specific policies and actions in support of
mountain areas.</STRONG>

<P>
<H2>The delegates recommend</H2>
<P>
<STRONG>In matters of general policy</STRONG>
<P>
<UL>
<LI> to support multidisciplinary research in mountain areas, in order to
assess the state of European mountains and the impact to date and potential
impact of climate change on these zones ;
<LI> to clearly define criteria for good and bad practices in sustainable
mountain development, to identify examples of good practice and to launch
and support a series of pilot projects ;
<LI> to promote the implementation of Agenda 21, by integrating the specific
needs of mountain areas into regional, national and European policies and
by defining specific commitments and responsibilities, taking into account
inter alias the proposed European Charter of Mountain Regions, the Alpine
Convention and the Charter for the Protection of the Pyrenees ;
<LI> to introduce a trans-sectoral approach to management of mountain regions,
adjusted to the great diversity of mountains and taking into account
interactions between mountains, lowlands and seas ;
<LI> to give more power to regional authorities in matters of sustainable
development and to establish and implement,  by consulting all interest
groups of the area concerned, a regional sustainable development plan for
each mountain region which analyses the state of the environmental,
socio<LI>economic and cultural quality of the region, the driving forces
behind barriers to sustainability, the ecological and economic impacts of
pressures on the region and the present policy outcomes ;
<LI> to reinforce interregional, interministerial and international
cooperation, which is indispensable for attaining sustainable mountain
development ;
<LI> to create, harmonise and implement legislation on the protection of
environment, to monitor sources of pollution and to introduce detailed
assessment procedures, in order to avoid investment that doesn't respect
the principles of sustainability ;
<LI> to reform the structural funds of the European Union, by redirecting
funds towards the ecological development of mountain regions adopting a
transsectoral approach and to create a structure for offering financial
support for sustainable mountain development in relevant regions outside
the European Union ;
<LI> to take into consideration the special problems of mountain areas
affected by war, in particular humanitarian problems, and to work towards
peace in these regions ;
<LI> that the European Union adopts a directive with a view to promoting
sustainable mountain development.
</UL>
<P>
<STRONG>In relation to Tourism and the Conservation of the Mountain Heritage</STRONG>
<P>
<UL>
<LI> to establish specific mountain tourism laws and policies, based on the
principles of sustainable development ;
<LI> to develop a "gentle" tourism based on promoting opportunity for informal
recreation that enhances the natural and cultural heritage, respects the
environment, is based on local populations and facilities (especially in
matters of accommodation), favours other traditional activities (especially
craft working) and provides a genuine supplementary income to local
populations and communes ;
<LI> to develop codes of good practice for particular mountain activities and
to promote these as international standards, aiming to make visitors, as
well as the local people, aware of the importance of mountains as a
natural, cultural and recreational resource ;
<LI> to develop and implement area plans with a view to achieving sustainable
mountain tourism, favouring integrated action, taking into account the
assessment of carrying capacity and ensuring the freedom of access ;
<LI> to monitor the environmental impact of tourism in sensitive zones, to
identify areas where there is a real or potential conflict between the
needs of mountain protection and those of mountain tourism (construction of
roads, skilifts, buildings...). Artificial snow making should be limited
where it would cause negative impacts on the environment ;
<LI> to develop a European Charter for Mountain Tourism reflecting the search
for an equilibrium between the needs of the natural environment and those
of tourism development. The Charter could include the concept of a "Label"
for quality mountain tourism and standards for pollution control,
environmental quality etc... ;
<LI> to consider favourable tax policies (e.g. tax-free zones) for small or
local organisations working on mountain tourism respecting environment and
to publicise any such support .
</UL>
<P>
<STRONG>In relation to Agriculture and Forests in Mountain Areas</STRONG>
<P>
<UL>
<LI> to support and develop small-scale mixed agriculture (combining farming,
forestry and livestock raising) and multiple employment, based on respect
for the environment, which assumes a particular economic and social
importance in mountain areas and an importance in terms of the conservation
of landscapes and heritage ;
<LI> to sustain, enhance or create a policy of support and compensation for
the handicaps of altitude and slope, remunerating the maintenance and
management of the landscape, opportunities for informal recreation and
supporting the integration of buildings which are in keeping with the
landscape. Such support may take the form of direct aid, reductions and
exemptions from land and other taxes, reduced interest rates for loans... ;
<LI> to promote solidarity between lowland and mountain areas and to change
the fund allocation of the European Union so as to provide greater support
for extensive grassland farming in mountains, for example by flat-rate aid
to farmers ;
<LI> to evaluate the harmful effects that current policies often produce in
mountain areas (farmland concentration, farmland abandonment, dairy
quotas...), and to modify their orientation with a view to sustainable
development ;
<LI> to remunerate at a fair price and to foster the development of
high-quality products often based on traditional know<LI>how, and in
particular organic agriculture, in order to supply local markets and the
ever-increasing demand from urban consumers; national and European
legislation and regulations should provide for such products to be
distinguished in the market-place, for example by creating labels or
appellations ;
<LI> to ensure the stringent health regulations applying to these products are
well adapted to and set within reach of small production and processing
facilities ;
<LI> to promote innovative solutions for better management of farm land ownership ;
<LI> to implement the recommendations of the intergovernmental conference of
Helsinki, and in particular the management and use of forests in a way that
maintains their biological diversity, their capacity for regeneration and
their ecological, recreational and economic functions.
</UL>
<P>
<STRONG>In matters of Planning and Infrastructure</STRONG>
<P>
<UL>
<LI> to undertake land management trying to avoid urban over-concentration and
to maintain viable populations in mountain areas centred on existing
villages;
<LI> that a management and development plan should be established for each
mountain massif and its communities or districts, with full public
participation, respecting the natural and cultural heritage including
habitat, air, water and soil quality and the tranquillity of mountain areas
;
<LI> to promote the grouping together of mountain communes in order to provide
them with enough weight to have responsibility for development and
management planning ;
<LI> that the European Union and national, regional and local authorities
guarantee the assessment of the environmental impact of all projects, right
from the initial phase of their conception, involving the participation of
local authorities, NGOs, local inhabitants and independent experts, and the
study of alternative projects and solutions and any necessary accompanying
measures. Such assessments should be undertaken with a strategic
perspective to take account of incremental development ; old projects
should be re-evaluated ;
<LI> for major projects, to undertake a rigorous public examination of the
need for the development and of alternative means of meeting any proven
need ;
<LI> that an effort should be taken in order to restrict growth in the
consumption of energy, products and raw material, and to develop recycling
of materials, in order to reduce damaging impacts on mountain areas ;
<LI> that the real cost of each mode of transport should be assessed,
including the social and ecological costs, and to switch transport,
particularly through traffic (international transit), to rail transport and
piggyback routes, by :
<UL>
<LI>using taxation and traffic restrictions, in order to reduce the modes of
transport that cause the most pollution and environmental nuisances ;
<LI>limiting drastically the building of new roads and motorways, in
particular new cross mountain axes; an exception may be made in specific
cases, for example to permit commercial relations in Eastern European
countries ;
</UL>
<LI> to modify the system of direct and indirect subsidies of governments and
the European Union affecting the process of production (from the
exploitation of resources to the manufacture of final products), in order
to avoid superfluous traffic ;
<LI> to reduce the nuisance caused by air traffic over and through the
mountains to a level that is bearable to inhabitants and the environment,
by restricting or banning tourist transport (propeller aircraft,
ultralights...) ;
<LI> that technical systems such as telecommunications and teleworking should
be developed in order to reduce the current huge increase in the mobility
of people and goods ;
<LI> to strengthen and to implement more effectively the system for
controlling European funds, in order to ensure projects respect the
environment and to block those that do not ;
<LI> that mountain populations and authorities should receive compensation for
infrastructure and services used by visitors and lowland inhabitants, with
a view to the principles of sustainable development defined above ;
<LI> to take into account the need of mountain inhabitants for affordable housing.
</UL>
<P>
<STRONG>The delegates request the Governments and the European Union officially to
acknowledge the rights of mountain populations and the role of local,
regional, national and international NGOs.</STRONG>
<P>
<STRONG>They request :</STRONG>
<P>
<UL>
<LI> to promote education and raise awareness of sustainable development among
all sectors of the population, to make sure that the right of free access
to information is respected, and to establish such laws in countries where
they do not exist ;
<LI> to ensure the participation of NGOs and concerned populations throughout
decision making (planning agreement, establishment, follow-up and control)
of all projects linked to sustainable mountain development, in particular
through the dissemination of information and formal public hearings ;
<LI> to promote mediation as a means of overcoming conflicts, in view of its
flexibility, speed and efficacy ;
<LI> to ensure that any member of the public is able to take legal action to
oppose major projects with serious environmental consequences ;
<LI> to make available funds for the activities of NGOs involved in
facilitating sustainable mountain development, and to recognise the
important role of local organisations ;
<LI> to promote the introduction of formal partnership structures ;
</UL>
<P>
<STRONG>The delegates express clearly the need for setting up a Network of
Participants in Sustainable Mountain Development in Europe, in order to
exchange information and experiences, and request support, especially
financial support, to promote that exchange network between mountain NGOs
and other actors concerned.</STRONG>
<P>
<STRONG>
The delegates ask that a follow up commission be set up to monitor the
results and impacts of the intergovernmental conference of Trento, in order
to evaluate measures adopted.<P>
NGOs should be properly represented in this commission.</STRONG><P>

aux gouvernements et   l'Union Europenne</H2></CENTER>

<H3>Ces recommandations sont issues de la Confrence
Europenne des ONG sur le Dveloppement Durable de la Montagne qui s'est
tenue  Toulouse, France, du 4 au 7 juillet 1996, dans le cadre de la mise
en oeuvre du chapitre 13 de l'Agenda 21</H3>

<STRONG>Considrant :</STRONG><BR>
<UL>
<LI> la notion de "dveloppement durable", dfinie dans le rapport de la commission mondiale sur l'environnement et le dveloppement (rapport Brundtland) comme "un dveloppement apte  rpondre aux besoins du prsent sans compromettre la possibilit de rpondre aux besoins des gnrations  venir" ;<BR>
<LI> l'importance des montagnes dans l'cosystme mondial, comme rservoir d'eau, d'nergie et de diversit biologique, de ressources essentielles telles que les minraux, les produits forestiers et agricoles, mais aussi comme espace de loisirs ;
<LI> qu'environ 10 % de la population est dpendante des ressources des montagnes, et qu'une proportion beaucoup plus grande prlve des ressources ; 
<LI> les caractristiques et problmes spcifiques des rgions de montagne, en termes de difficults conomiques et de fragilit de l'environnement (altitude, relief, conditions climatiques...)
<LI> la diversit des montagnes  l'chelle europenne ;
<LI> l'engagement des gouvernements d'agir en vue d'un dveloppement durable des zones de montagne, formalis dans le chapitre 13 de l'Agenda 21, labor lors de la confrence de Rio de 1992, ainsi que le processus intergouvernemental actuellement en cours en vue de la tenue de la confrence mondiale de la montagne en 1997.

<STRONG>
Compte tenu : </STRONG><BR>
<LI> de la Consultation Europenne au moyen d'un questionnaire traduit en 16 langues et diffus auprs de plus de 5000 ONG dans 45 pays europens, et notamment du taux de rponse de presque 19 %, tmoignant de l'intrt majeur que les ONG et les populations portent au sujet du dveloppement durable des montagnes ;
<LI> des opinions et souhaits exprims, soulignant en particulier :  
<LI> que les ONG estiment en grande majorit que rien n'a chang pour les zones de montagnes depuis la confrence de Rio ;
<LI> que les meilleurs dfenseurs des intrts de la montagne sont les habitants et les ONG, et qu'ils sont mal reprsents dans les instances des pays europens ;
<LI> que le dveloppement durable de la montagne ncessite prioritairement une concertation entre tous les acteurs impliqus et qu'une coopration interrgionale et internationale est indispensable, notamment dans le cas des massifs transfrontaliers ;
<LI> qu'il faut crer des lois spcifiques  la montagne l o elles n'existent pas ;
<LI> que des dangers importants lis aux activits humaines menacent l'environnement en montagne, et que les mesures actuellement prises en matire de protection sont insuffisantes ;

<H2><CENTER>The European Consultation of NGO</CENTER><CENTER> and Populations </CENTER>
<CENTER>on Sustainable Mountain Development</CENTER></H2>


<STRONG>General information:</STRONG><P>

In June 1992, at the Conference at Rio, called the "Earth Summit", the countries unanimously adopted Agenda 21, a plan for action into the 21st century. The specific problems of the mountain regions were addressed in Chapter 13 of this document, giving recommendations for the management of fragile ecosystems with a view to the sustainable development of mountains. Since that time, mountain regions have become a major field of attention for the United Nations.<BR>
 
In regard to the implementation of the recommendations, and in preparation of the special session of the UN which is scheduled for 1997, several European intergovernmental consultations were organized. The European consultation took place April 22 - 26 in Aviemore, Scotland (first session) and October 7-11 in Trento, Italy (second session). The coordination of this conference was carried out by the European Programme of the World Conservation Union (IUCN) and by the International Centre for Alpine Environments (ICALPE).<BR>

Simultaneously with this intergovernmental working process, the FAO wished to record the perceptions and the opinions of the mountain populations. For this reason, a European consultation of populations and NGOs concerned with the sustainable development of mountains took place.<P>


<STRONG>Objectives</STRONG><P>

Organized by the Regional Agency for the Environment of Midi-Pyrnes, France (ARPE*) under the patronage of the CTP* and in cooperation with the CIAPP*, this consultation made it possible for NGOs to take part actively in the European intergovernmental process. The opinion of those who live in and who are concerned with the mountains is particularly important in that process. Their perception of the mountain populations, their reflections and their knowledge are indispensable in considering the current problems, and in defining possible development strategies and proposing concrete actions. <P>

The <STRONG>global objectives</STRONG> of the NGO consultation, as a part of the intergovernmental process, were:<P>
<UL>
<LI> to strengthen collective concern about the value of mountains,<BR>
<LI> to gain a better understanding of the major issues to be considered in regard to sustainable mountain development, <BR>
<LI> to propose strategies of sustainable development for the mountains of Europe.<P>
</UL>
The specific objectives of the consultation were :<P>
<UL>
<LI> to rise awareness of the populations in favor of sustainable mountain development
<LI> to work out proposals which will be presented to the representatives of governments at the second session of the Intergovernmental Conference in Trento.
<LI> to think about the creation of a "mountain network" favoring the exchange of information and experience between the actors involved.
</UL>
<STRONG>Countries and populations concerned</STRONG><P>

The consultation of NGOs concerned not only the European countries and regions with mountains (see map), but also the lowlands. Indeed, the mountains are important for the populations of lowlands in regard to the supply of water, mineral resources, fuel wood and wood for construction, farming products, energy, and so on. On the other hand, mountains are a privileged site for leisure activities.<P>

For this reason, the consultation wanted to touch not only the mountain inhabitants, but also the "users" of mountain resources. In this way, all kinds of NGOs involved at a local, regional, national or international level in mountain development, of all European countries, were consulted: associations for nature protection, socio-professional organizations, cultural and sporting associations...<P>

<STRONG>The two phases of the consultation</STRONG><P>

<STRONG>First phase: the inquiry</STRONG><P>

The inquiry was intended to inform the NGOs about the specific problems in mountains but also to record the opinion of the populations concerned. 

Translated in 16 languages and sent to more than 5000 NGOs in 45 European countries, it was the main element of mobilization: 928 NGOs have replied to the inquiry, corresponding to a response rate of nearly 19 %<P>

<STRONG>Phase 2: The Conference  - Toulouse  (4, 5, 6 and 7-July 1996)</STRONG><P>

The conference was composed of plenary sessions and of working sessions. 
The topics of the working sessions correspond to the 4 major concerns of NGOs pointed out by the inquiry: NGOs as key participants in sustainable mountain development; tourism and the conservation of the mountain heritage; the roles of agriculture and forests; and planning and infrastructure.<P>
 
The recommendations worked out during the meeting were presented at the Intergovernmental Conference in Trento, in October 1996. <P>


*ARPE:  created in 1990, the Regional Agency for the Environment is responsible for the promotion of environmental issues and of sustainable development by the means of rising public awareness, of prevention, of research, of conservation and of promotion of the natural heritage.<P>

*CTP : an interregional association, the Work Community of the Pyrenees concerns the Perennial regions in France and Spain, and the state of Andorra. Since 1993, it has been involved in the search for sustainable development to the massif. <P>

*CIAPP: the International Associated Council for the Protection of the Pyrenees combines since 1989 the federations and associations that work in the three Pyrenean countries (France, Spain, Andorra) towards the protection of the massif. <P>

<CENTER><H2>La Consultation Europenne des ONG et des Populations 
sur le Dveloppement Durable de la Montagne</H2></CENTER><P>

<H3>Le contexte gnral</H3><P>

Lors du "Sommet Plante Terre"  Rio en 1992, les tats ont adopt  l'unanimit l'Agenda 21, un plan d'action pour le 21me sicle. Les problmes et enjeux de la montagne ont fait l'objet de recommandations spcifiques dveloppes dans le chapitre 13, intitul: "Grer les cosystmes fragiles : dveloppement durable de la montagne". Depuis lors, les zones de montagne constituent un sujet de rflexion et de travail prioritaire pour les Nations Unies.<P>

Dans le cadre de la mise en oeuvre des ces recommandations et afin de prparer la session spciale de l'ONU prvue en 1997, une srie de consultations intergouvernementales ont t fixes. Celle concernant l'Europe s'est droul en deux temps : Aviemore en cosse du 22 au 26 avril 1996 puis  Trento en Italie du 7 au 11 octobre 1996. La coordination de cette confrence a t confie conjointement au Programme Europen de l'Union Internationale de Conservation de la Nature (UICN) et au Centre International pour l'Environnement Alpin (ICALPE).<P>

La FAO, charge du suivi de ces travaux, a souhait recueillir galement les perceptions et souhaits des populations de montagne. C'est la raison pour laquelle une consultation des Organisations Non Gouvernementales (ONG) a t ralise en parallle  la consultation intergouvernementale.<P>



<H3>Les objectifs</H3><P>

Organise par l'Agence Rgionale Pour l'Environnement de Midi-Pyrnes, France (ARPE*) avec le parrainage de la CTP* et en partenariat avec le CIAPP*, la consultation a permis aux ONG de participer activement  la rflexion engage au niveau intergouvernemental. En effet la contribution de ceux qui vivent en montagne ou encore de ceux qui s'y intressent est, dans ce processus, d'un intrt majeur. Leur perception de l'espace montagnard, leur rflexion, leur connaissance sont indispensables pour reprer les difficults actuelles, dfinir les stratgies possibles et proposer des actions concrtes.<P>
<STRONG>Les objectifs gnraux de la consultation qui s'inscrivent dans ceux de la confrence intergouvernementale visaient </STRONG><P>
<UL>
<LI> favoriser une conscience collective de la valeur de la montagne,
<LI> obtenir une meilleure comprhension des problmes  prendre en compte pour un dveloppement durable de la montagne,
<LI> laborer des stratgies de dveloppement durable pour les montagnes d'Europe.<P>
</UL>

<STRONG>Quant aux objectifs spcifiques, ils visaient  :</STRONG><P>
<UL>
<LI> mobiliser les populations en faveur du dveloppement durable de la montagne,
<LI> laborer des propositions  soumettre aux reprsentants des gouvernements  l'occasion de la 2me session de travail de la confrence intergouvernementale de Trento ;
<LI> rflchir sur l'organisation d'un rseau "montagne" afin de favoriser les changes d'informations et d'expriences entre les acteurs concerns.<P>
</UL>


<STRONG>Pays et populations concerns</STRONG><P>

La consultation des ONG n'a concern non seulement les pays et rgions europens qui comportent des zones de montagne, mais aussi les rgions et pays situs en aval. 
En effet les montagnes participent de la vie des populations de plaine  travers l'approvisionnement en eau, en lments nutritifs, en minraux, en bois de coupe et de chauffe, en produits agricoles, en nergie hydrolectrique... et constituent des lieux privilgis de loisirs.<P>

Ainsi donc, la consultation a vis, trs prcisment, les habitants de la montagne, mais aussi des "utilisateurs" des ressources disponibles. C'est la raison pour laquelle ont t consultes les ONG de tous les pays de l'Europe, reprsentant la socit civile dans ces diffrentes composantes, qu'il s'agisse d'associations de protection de la nature, d'organisations socio-professionnelles, culturelles,  sportives..., qu'elles agissent au niveau local, national ou international.<P>


<STRONG>Les deux phases de la consultation</STRONG><P>

<STRONG>Phase 1 : L'enqute</STRONG><P>
<UL>
<LI>Son objet tait d'informer et d'interpeller les ONG sur les problmatiques actuelles des zones de montagne mais aussi de recueillir les opinions des populations concernes. <P>
<LI>Traduite en 16 langues et diffuse auprs de plus de 5000 ONG rparties dans 45 pays, elle a constitu l'lment fort de la mobilisation: 928 ONG ont rpondu  l'enqute, ce qui correspond  un taux de rponse de presque 19 %. <P>
</UL>
<STRONG>Phase 2 : Les assises  - Toulouse 4, 5 , 6  et 7 juillet 1996</STRONG><P>
<UL>
<LI>Les Assises ont t organises autour de sances plnires et de travaux en atelier. Les thmes de travail retenues correspondaient aux 4 grandes proccupations des ONG qui se sont dgages de l'enqute: les ONG comme acteurs-cls dans le dveloppement durable, tourisme et conservation du patrimoine, le rle de l'agriculture et de la fort, et planification et infrastructures. <P>

<LI>Les recommandations labores  cette occasion ont t soutenues  la confrence intergouvernementale de Trento en octobre 1996. <P>

<CENTER>MANAGING FRAGILE ECOSYSTEMS:  SUSTAINABLE 
MOUNTAIN DEVELOPMENT</CENTER>


                          <CENTER>    INTRODUCTION</CENTER><P>

13.1.  Mountains are an important source of water, energy and
biological diversity.  Furthermore, they are a source of such key
resources as minerals, forest products and agricultural products
and of recreation.  As a major ecosystem representing the complex
and interrelated ecology of our planet, mountain environments are
essential to the survival of the global ecosystem.  Mountain
ecosystems are, however, rapidly changing.  They are susceptible
to accelerated soil erosion, landslides and rapid loss of habitat
and genetic diversity.  On the human side, there is widespread
poverty among mountain inhabitants and loss of indigenous
knowledge.  As a result, most global mountain areas are
experiencing environmental degradation.  Hence, the proper
management of mountain resources and socio-economic development of
the people deserves immediate action.<p>

13.2.  About 10 per cent of the world's population depends on
mountain resources.  A much larger percentage draws on other
mountain resources, including and especially water.  Mountains are
a storehouse of biological diversity and endangered species.<p>

13.3.  Two programme areas are included in this chapter to further
elaborate the problem of fragile ecosystems with regard to all
mountains of the world.  These are:<p>

 (a)  Generating and strengthening knowledge about the ecology
and sustainable development of mountain ecosystems;<p>

    (b)  Promoting integrated watershed development and
alternative livelihood opportunities.<p>


                           <CENTER>  PROGRAMME AREAS</Center>

      A.  Generating and strengthening knowledge about the
ecology and  sustainable development of mountain ecosystems<p>

Basis for action<p>

13.4.  Mountains are highly vulnerable to human and natural
ecological imbalance.  Mountains are the areas most sensitive to
all climatic changes in the atmosphere.  Specific information on
ecology, natural resource potential and socio-economic activities
is essential.  Mountain and hillside areas hold a rich variety of
ecological systems.  Because of their vertical dimensions,
mountains create gradients of temperature, precipitation and
insolation.  A given mountain slope may include several climatic
systems - such as tropical, subtropical, temperate and alpine -
each of which represents a microcosm of a larger habitat
diversity.  There is, however, a lack of knowledge of mountain
ecosystems.  The creation of a global mountain database is
therefore vital for launching programmes that contribute to the
sustainable development of mountain ecosystems.<p>

Objectives<p>

13.5.  The objectives of this programme area are:<p>

    (a)  To undertake a survey of the different forms of soils,
forest, water use, crop, plant and animal resources of mountain
ecosystems, taking into account the work of existing international
and regional organizations;<p>

    (b)  To maintain and generate database and information systems
to facilitate the integrated management and environmental
assessment of mountain ecosystems, taking into account the work of
existing international and regional organizations;<p>

    (c)  To improve and build the existing land/water ecological
knowledge base regarding technologies and agricultural and
conservation practices in the mountain regions of the world, with
the participation of local communities;<p>

    (d)  To create and strengthen the communications network and
information clearing-house for existing organizations concerned
with mountain issues; <p>

    (e)  To improve coordination of regional efforts to protect
fragile mountain ecosystems through the consideration of
appropriate mechanisms, including regional legal and other
instruments; <p>

    (f)  To generate information to establish databases and
information systems to facilitate an evaluation of environmental
risks and natural disasters in mountain ecosystems.<p>

Activities<p>

<STRONG>(a)</STRONG> Management-related activities<p>

13.6.  Governments at the appropriate level, with the support of
the relevant international and regional organizations, should:<p>

    (a)  Strengthen existing institutions or establish new ones at
local, national and regional levels to generate a
multidisciplinary land/water ecological knowledge base on mountain
ecosystems;<p>

    (b)  Promote national policies that would provide incentives
to local people for the use and transfer of environment-friendly
technologies and farming and conservation practices;<p>

    (c)  Build up the knowledge base and understanding by creating
mechanisms for cooperation and information exchange among national
and regional institutions working on fragile ecosystems;<p>

    (d)  Encourage policies that would provide incentives to
farmers and local people to undertake conservation and
regenerative measures;<p>

    (e)  Diversify mountain economies, inter alia, by creating
and/or strengthening tourism, in accordance with integrated
management of mountain areas;<p>

    (f)  Integrate all forest, rangeland and wildlife activities
in such a way that specific mountain ecosystems are maintained;<p>

    (g)  Establish appropriate natural reserves in representative
species-rich sites and areas.<p>

<STRONG>(b) </STRONG>Data and information<p>

13.7.  Governments at the appropriate level, with the support of
the relevant international and regional organizations, should:<p>

    (a)  Maintain and establish meteorological, hydrological and
physical monitoring analysis and capabilities that would encompass
the climatic diversity as well as water distribution of various
mountain regions of the world;<p>

    (b)  Build an inventory of different forms of soils, forests,
water use, and crop, plant and animal genetic resources, giving
priority to those under threat of extinction.  Genetic resources
should be protected in situ by maintaining and establishing
protected areas and improving traditional farming and animal
husbandry activities and establishing programmes for evaluating
the potential value of the resources;<p>

    (c)  Identify hazardous areas that are most vulnerable to
erosion, floods, landslides, earthquakes, snow avalanches and
other natural hazards;<P>

    (d)  Identify mountain areas threatened by air pollution from
neighbouring industrial and urban areas.<P>

<STRONG>(c)</STRONG> International and regional cooperation<P>

13.8.  National Governments and intergovernmental organizations
should:<P>

    (a)  Coordinate regional and international cooperation and
facilitate an exchange of information and experience among the
specialized agencies, the World Bank, IFAD and other international
and regional organizations, national Governments, research
institutions and non-governmental organizations working on
mountain development;<P>

    (b)  Encourage regional, national and international networking
of people's initiatives and the activities of international,
regional and local non-governmental organizations working on
mountain development, such as the United Nations University (UNU),
the Woodland Mountain Institutes (WMI), the International Center
for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD), the International
Mountain Society (IMS), the African Mountain Association and the
Andean Mountain Association, besides supporting those
organizations in exchange of information and experience;<P>

    (c)  Protect Fragile Mountain Ecosystem through the
consideration of appropriate mechanisms including regional legal
and other instruments.<P>

Means of implementation<P>

<STRONG>(a) </STRONG>Financing and cost evaluation<P>

13.9.  The Conference secretariat has estimated the average total
annual cost (1993-2000) of implementing the activities of this
programme to be about $50 million from the international community
on grant or concessional terms.  These are indicative and
order-of-magnitude estimates only and have not been reviewed by
Governments.  Actual costs and financial terms, including any that
are non-concessional, will depend upon, inter alia, the specific
strategies and programmes Governments decide upon for implementation.<P>

<STRONG>(b)</STRONG> Scientific and technological means<P>

13.10.  Governments at the appropriate level, with the support of
the relevant international and regional organizations, should
strengthen scientific research and technological development
programmes, including diffusion through national and regional
institutions, particularly in meteorology, hydrology, forestry,
soil sciences and plant sciences.<P>

<STRONG>(c) </STRONG>Human resource development<P>

13.11.  Governments at the appropriate level, and with the support
of the relevant international and regional organizations, should:<P>

    (a)  Launch training and extension programmes in
environmentally appropriate technologies and practices that would
be suitable to mountain ecosystems;<P>

    (b)  Support higher education through fellowships and research
grants for environmental studies in mountains and hill areas,
particularly for candidates from indigenous mountain populations;<P>

    (c)  Undertake environmental education for farmers, in
particular for women, to help the rural population better
understand the ecological issues regarding the sustainable
development of mountain ecosystems.<P>

    <STRONG> (d)</STRONG> Capacity-building<p>

13.12.  Governments at the appropriate level, with the support of
the relevant international and regional organizations, should
build up national and regional institutional bases that could
carry out research, training and dissemination of information on
the sustainable development of the economies of fragile ecosystems.<P>

        B.  Promoting integrated watershed development and
alternative livelihood opportunities<P>

Basis for action<P>

13.13.  Nearly half of the world's population is affected in
various ways by mountain ecology and the degradation of watershed
areas.  About 10 per cent of the Earth's population lives in
mountain areas with higher slopes, while about 40 per cent
occupies the adjacent medium- and lower-watershed areas.  There
are serious problems of ecological deterioration in these
watershed areas.  For example, in the hillside areas of the Andean
countries of South America a large portion of the farming
population is now faced with a rapid deterioration of land
resources.  Similarly, the mountain and upland areas of the
Himalayas, South-East Asia and East and Central Africa, which make
vital contributions to agricultural production, are threatened by
cultivation of marginal lands due to expanding population.  In
many areas this is accompanied by excessive livestock grazing,
deforestation and loss of biomass cover.<P>

13.14.  Soil erosion can have a devastating impact on the vast
numbers of rural people who depend on rainfed agriculture in the
mountain and hillside areas.  Poverty, unemployment, poor health
and bad sanitation are widespread.  Promoting integrated watershed
development programmes through effective participation of local
people is a key to preventing further ecological imbalance.  An
integrated approach is needed for conserving, upgrading and using
the natural resource base of land, water, plant, animal and human
resources.  In addition, promoting alternative livelihood
opportunities, particularly through development of employment
schemes that increase the productive base, will have a significant
role in improving the standard of living among the large rural
population living in mountain ecosystems.<P>

Objectives<P>

13.15.  The objectives of this programme area are:<P>

    (a)  By the year 2000, to develop appropriate land-use
planning and management for both arable and non-arable land in
mountain-fed watershed areas to prevent soil erosion, increase
biomass production and maintain the ecological balance;<P>

    (b)  To promote income-generating activities, such as
sustainable tourism, fisheries and environmentally sound mining,
and to improve infrastructure and social services, in particular
to protect the livelihoods of local communities and indigenous people;<P>

    (c)  To develop technical and institutional arrangements for
affected countries to mitigate the effects of natural disasters
through hazard-prevention measures, risk zoning, early-warning
systems, evacuation plans and emergency supplies.<P>

Activities<P>

<STRONG>(a)</STRONG> Management-related activities<P>

13.16.  Governments at the appropriate level, with the support of
the relevant international and regional organizations, should:<P>

    (a)  Undertake measures to prevent soil erosion and promote
erosion-control activities in all sectors;<P>

    (b)  Establish task forces or watershed development
committees, complementing existing institutions, to coordinate
integrated services to support local initiatives in animal
husbandry, forestry, horticulture and rural development at all
administrative levels;<P>

    (c)  Enhance popular participation in the management of local
resources through appropriate legislation;<P>

    (d)  Support non-governmental organizations and other private
groups assisting local organizations and communities in the
preparation of projects that would enhance participatory
development of local people;<P>

    (e)  Provide mechanisms to preserve threatened areas that
could protect wildlife, conserve biological diversity or serve as
national parks;<P>

    (f)  Develop national policies that would provide incentives
to farmers and local people to undertake conservation measures and
to use
environment-friendly technologies;<P>

    (g)  Undertake income-generating activities in cottage and
agro-processing industries, such as the cultivation and processing
of medicinal and aromatic plants;<P>

    (h)  Undertake the above activities, taking into account the
need for full participation of women, including indigenous people
and local communities, in development.<P>

   <STRONG> (b) </STRONG> Data and information<P>

13.17.  Governments at the appropriate level, with the support of
the relevant international and regional organizations, should:<P>

    (a)  Maintain and establish systematic observation and
evaluation capacities at the national, state or provincial level
to generate information for daily operations and to assess the
environmental and socio-economic impacts of projects;<P>

    (b)  Generate data on alternative livelihoods and diversified
production systems at the village level on annual and tree crops,
livestock, poultry, beekeeping, fisheries, village industries,
markets, transport and income-earning opportunities, taking fully
into account the role of women and integrating them into the
planning and implementation process.<P>

<STRONG>(c) </STRONG>International and regional cooperation<P>

13.18.  Governments at the appropriate level, with the support of
the relevant international and regional organizations, should:<P>

    (a)  Strengthen the role of appropriate international research
and training institutes such as the Consultative Group on
International Agricultural Research Centers (CGIAR) and the
International Board for Soil Research and Management (IBSRAM), as
well as regional research centres, such as the Woodland Mountain
Institutes and the International Center for Integrated Mountain
Development, in undertaking applied research relevant to watershed
development;<P>

    (b)  Promote regional cooperation and exchange of data and
information among countries sharing the same mountain ranges and
river basins, particularly those affected by mountain disasters
and floods; <P>

    (c)  Maintain and establish partnerships with non-governmental
organizations and other private groups working in watershed
development.<P>

Means of implementation<P>

<STRONG>(a) </STRONG>Financial and cost evaluation<P>

13.19.  The Conference secretariat has estimated the average total
annual cost (1993-2000) of implementing the activities of this
programme to be about $13 billion, including about $1.9 billion
from the international community on grant or concessional terms.
These are indicative and order-of-magnitude estimates only and
have not been reviewed by Governments.  Actual costs and financial
terms, including any that are non-concessional, will depend upon,
inter alia, the specific strategies and programmes Governments
decide upon for implementation.<P>

13.20.  Financing for the promotion of alternative livelihoods in
mountain ecosystems should be viewed as part of a country's
anti-poverty or alternative livelihoods programme, which is also
discussed in chapter 3 (Combating poverty) and chapter 14
(Promoting sustainable agriculture and rural development) of
Agenda 21.<P>

<STRONG>(b) </STRONG> Scientific and technical means<P>

13.21.  Governments at the appropriate level, with the support of
the relevant international and regional organizations, should:<P>

    (a)  Consider undertaking pilot projects that combine
environmental protection and development functions with particular
emphasis on some of the traditional environmental management
practices or systems that have a good impact on the environment;<P>

    (b)  Generate technologies for specific watershed and farm
conditions through a participatory approach involving local men
and women, researchers and extension agents who will carry out
experiments and trials on farm conditions;<P>

    (c)  Promote technologies of vegetative conservation measures
for erosion prevention, in situ moisture management, improved
cropping technology, fodder production and agroforestry that are
low-cost, simple and easily adopted by local people.<P>

   <STRONG> (c) </STRONG>
 Human resource development<p>

13.22.  Governments at the appropriate level, with the support of
the relevant international and regional organizations, should:<P>

    (a)  Promote a multidisciplinary and cross-sectoral approach
in training and the dissemination of knowledge to local people on
a wide range of issues, such as household production systems,
conservation and utilization of arable and non-arable land,
treatment of drainage lines and recharging of groundwater,
livestock management, fisheries, agroforestry and horticulture;<p>

    (b)  Develop human resources by providing access to education,
health, energy and infrastructure;<p>

    (c)  Promote local awareness and preparedness for disaster
prevention and mitigation, combined with the latest available
technology for early warning and forecasting.<P>

 Capacity-building<P>

13.23.  Governments at the appropriate level, with the support of
the relevant international and regional organizations, should
develop and strengthen national centres for watershed management
to encourage a comprehensive approach to the environmental,
socio-economic, technological, legislative, financial and
administrative aspects and provide support to policy makers,
administrators, field staff and farmers for watershed development.<P>

13.24.  The private sector and local communities, in cooperation
with national Governments, should promote local infrastructure
development, including communication networks, mini- or
micro-hydro development to support cottage industries, and access
to markets.<P>

1.   The present report describes the progress made in the implementation of
the aims set out in chapter 13 of Agenda 21 (Managing fragile ecosystems: 
sustainable mountain development) 1/ since the United Nations Conference on
Environment and Development (UNCED) in June 1992, and contains a set of
recommendations for action.  The report was prepared by the Food and
Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) as Task Manager for
chapter 13 of Agenda 21 in consultation with the United Nations Secretariat
and in accordance with arrangements agreed to by the Inter-Agency Committee on
Sustainable Development (IACSD) at its fourth session.  At the Conference,
Governments recognized mountains as an important source of water, energy and
biological diversity, as well as a source of such key resources as minerals,
forest products and agricultural products and of recreation.  It was realized
that mountain ecosystems were essential to the survival of the global
ecosystem and that about 10 per cent of the world's population depended
directly on mountain resources, with a much larger percentage (estimated at
40 per cent of the world's population) drawing on other mountain resources,
including in particular water (it is estimated that mountains are the source
of about 80 per cent of the world's water resources). <P>

2.   Chapter 13 of Agenda 21 contains two programme areas for action: 
(a) generating and strengthening knowledge about the ecology and sustainable
development of mountain ecosystems; and (b) Promoting integrated watershed
development and alternative livelihood opportunities.  However, while the two
areas have their particular significance, in the present report they are
treated together, with special emphasis on the need for an integrated
ecosystems approach to sustainable mountain development.<P>

3.   The network established during the first ad hoc inter-agency meeting on
chapter 13 of Agenda 21, held in Rome on 21 and 22 March 1994, has developed a
set of proposals for action by United Nations organizations, as well as by
international non-governmental organizations (NGOs) involved in sustainable
mountain development.  It has been generally agreed that a special effort will
be needed to move the "mountain agenda" higher on the international and
national development agendas.  The above-mentioned NGOs have agreed to
recognize chapter 13 of Agenda 21, as adopted by the Conference, as a basis
for action and to participate in mountain development programmes in a spirit
of cooperation with Governments.  With the encouragement of the United Nations
inter-agency group on mountains, a global conference of intergovernmental and
non-governmental organizations is to take place in February 1995, in addition
to the series of regional intergovernmental consultations that began in
December in the Asia and Pacific region and will continue in Latin America and
the Caribbean in April 1995.  Consultations in Africa, Europe and North
America could take place later in 1995 and in 1996.<P>

4.   Although many important urban-based development activities occur in
mountains, the present report concentrates mainly on new approaches concerning
the integrated management of the natural resource base, the interaction
between rural mountain populations and resources in terms of sustainable
livelihoods, and efforts to ensure environmentally sound and sustainable
development of mountain areas.<P>


                       <CENTER>      I.  GENERAL OVERVIEW</CENTER><P>

    <CENTER>   A.  Mountain issues, identified gaps and opportunities for action</CENTER><p>

5.   Mountain ecosystems and environments are of critical importance as water
stores.  They are often physically unstable (subject to earthquakes,
landslides and volcanic and torrential phenomena) and sometimes plentiful in
mineral resources.  Biologically, mountain ecosystems are characterized by
altitudinal zonation and microclimatic "niches" generating a rich but fragile
biological diversity.  Characteristically, human communities in mountains are
self-reliant and have a detailed knowledge of the ecosystems on which they
depend and of how to utilize them.  Cultural diversity and richness parallel
the biological diversity, and the specific sacred and/or religious
significance of the mountains themselves is often a prominent cultural
feature.<p>

6.   The complexity and diversity of mountain ecosystems make it difficult to
generalize.  The need for a comprehensive, interdisciplinary approach to
sustainable mountain development with the effective participation and
empowerment of mountain people has been recognized, as has the need to further
increase awareness at all levels of society of the importance of mountain
ecosystems, together with their problems and potential.  The prevalence of
absolute and relative poverty in mountainous regions and the downstream
consequences of the degradation of mountain ecosystems are recognized as major
reasons for mobilizing international efforts to assist countries 2/ to
formulate and implement strategies for sustainable mountain development.  A
priority will be to develop and test potentially replicable models for rural
poverty alleviation 3/ that can overcome the obstacles facing populations in
upland areas and ease their transition to more sustainable livelihoods.  These
should build on local knowledge, capacities and opportunities, suggesting in
turn that for mountainous regions, multiple adaptive models are likely to be
more successful than approaches based on a uniform development paradigm.<p>

7.   There is a general lack of suitable institutional mechanisms to ensure
an integrated approach, in view of the complexity of mountain ecosystems and
the socio-economic issues at stake.  In addition, there is scope for improved
policy and legislation for mountain areas, as well as for training and
capacity-building, to make the implementation of chapter 13 of Agenda 21
possible.  The need for long-term projects and programmes and long-term
monitoring of their environmental benefits is emphasized.<p>

8.   Linkages between traditional knowledge and practices and their effect on
ecosystems should receive more attention.  Linkages between data collection
and research, and the utilization and application of results need
reinforcement.  A recurrent issue is the plea for more action-oriented data
collection and research linked to specific pilot areas where different
government agencies and non-governmental organizations could coordinate
interventions.  Research should also be more responsive to the needs and
aspirations of mountain populations.  Improved information systems, networking
and accessible databases have been identified as a priority area for action.<p>

9.   Traditionally mountains have had their natural and human resources
drained to benefit the lowlands.  At present, however, mountainous countries
can support their upland programmes to a greater degree by channelling some
returns from mountain-derived benefits (such as hydropower, mining, forestry,
tourism), where appropriate, back into the uplands.  The empowerment of
mountain communities, including increased control over local resource
conservation and management, in order to become more directly involved in
income-earning activities, is seen as a necessary step in a strategy for
sustainable mountain development.<p>


               <CENTER>          B.  Difficulties encountered</CENTER><P>

10.  One of the main difficulties encountered so far is the failure to see
mountain areas as something special, with a potential of their own and
therefore worthy of special attention.  This is reflected in the lack of
mountain programmes of agencies, but maybe even more so at the national level,
where it is still rare to find departments, programmes or legislation dealing
in a comprehensive way with mountain issues.  More often than not mountain
areas and populations are at the "thin end" of general national programmes of
education, health, infrastructure and the like, mainly because the cost per
person of providing such services in remote mountain areas is above the
national average and therefore seen by sectoral agencies as uneconomical, and
because of inadequate recognition of the value of mountain natural resources. 
Hence in addition to ongoing sectoral efforts there is a need for
comprehensive programmes, at the national and international levels, designed
specifically for mountain areas or, even better, originating in mountain
areas. <p>


                         <CENTER>       C.  Time-frame</CENTER><p>

11.  Mountain cultures are old, sometimes very old.  National and
international programmes in the mountains have been ongoing for decades.  It
should be stressed that international consultations on sustainable mountain
development as a follow-up to UNCED will take time.  The "mountain agenda"
will therefore need special emphasis in order to realize the national
planning, legislation and investments called for, and even then only partial
realization of this critical agenda can be envisioned.  Emphasis should
therefore be placed on the formulation and installation of flexible, long-
term, support mechanisms, with the mountain populations themselves playing the
lead role and determining the timetable.  However, in such areas as poverty
alleviation, management of natural resources and capacity-building,
significant progress and greater support is urgently needed.<p>


              <CENTER>              D.  Development models</CENTER><p>

12.  The Consortium for Research and Development in the Andean Ecoregion
(CONDESAN), has provided a novel approach to mountain development research by
looking at mountain issues in a comprehensive ecosystemic way and being open
to different partners in a collaborative effort.  Working at the local level,
the approach is that of an "open consortium", involving a group of Andean
government agencies working together with one or several NGOs under the
general coordination of an informal "committee" in which all participating
organizations are represented. <p>

13.  The Tropical Forests Action Programme (TFAP) has gone through a series
of revisions and modifications since being launched in 1985, but has proved to
be a survivor.  It has so far involved more than 90 developing (not
necessarily tropical) countries.  It has developed mechanisms for
participatory programme development and public debates concerning the
contribution of the forestry sector to national development, which would be
suitable for the formulation of mountain action programmes as well.<p>

14.  In addition to these two examples, a wealth of ongoing and recent
operational models for community-based natural resource conservation and
management are being introduced and tested.  These include programmes of
national and international NGOs, such as the King Mahendra Trust for Nature
Conservation (Nepal), the Aga Khan Rural Support Programme (Pakistan) and The
Mountain Institute (TMI) (Himalayas and Andes); Intergovernmental
organizations, such as FAO, the International Fund for Agricultural
Development (IFAD), the International Centre for Research in Agroforestry
(ICRAF) and the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development
(ICIMOD); and many national Governments, with or without external support.<P>


                <CENTER>  II.  REVIEW OF PROGRESS ACHIEVED, MAIN POLICY ISSUES
                     AND EXPERIENCES  </CENTER><P>

                      <CENTER>       A.  Country experiences  </CENTER><P>  

                            <CENTER>1.  Developed countries  </CENTER><P>

15.  In mountain areas, the main challenges faced by industrialized countries
relate to depopulation, abandonment of sustainable systems of natural resource
management (e.g., forests and mountain pastures), the increasing use of land
for recreational activities, and the provision of protection from natural
hazards.<P>

16.  Depopulation of mountain areas - in Europe, most notably in France and
Spain - is often a result of the creation of economic opportunities in the
lowland industrial and urban centres, combined with the failure to generate
sufficient employment and improved livelihood opportunities in the mountains. 
In Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United States of America, for
example, "modernization" in pastoral management has led to a withdrawal from
marginal range land and pasture land that are no longer needed or have become
uneconomical to graze.<P>

17.  The process of depopulation is at present being reversed by important
investments in infrastructure for tourism and recreation.  Some mountain areas
have become attractive and expensive ski resorts (Aspen, Colorado, United
States of America; Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy) or popular to the point where
artificial snow and light (in Japan for example) must be provided for skiers
24 hours a day in order to meet the demand.  This in turn is leading to the
need to construct super highways, hotels, ski lifts and so forth and to
reshape mountain slopes to make ski runs, thereby creating new environmental
pressures.<P>

18.  The shift from peasant agriculture to the tourist industry has led to a
jump in demand for safety measures against natural phenomena.  The original
population would remain indoors during a blizzard and would be familiar with
the snow and weather conditions and the increased risk of avalanches.  The
majority of mountain tourists however, require roads to remain open at all
times, and are unaware of the rapid weather changes in mountains.  The
investments in torrent and avalanche control measures to protect visiting
tourists are many times greater than those needed to protect the original
population. <P>

19.  At the same time it has become increasingly difficult to establish and
maintain stable forest and range vegetative cover with adequate protective
functions.  Many mountain areas in industrialized countries were artificially
afforested or reforested in the nineteenth century.  Today these plantations
and the remaining more or less natural forests suffer from lack of
silvicultural interventions, overmaturation and inadequate control of
excessive wildlife populations (which, in addition to being a generally
uneconomical activity, is not appreciated by the general public), and new
environmental conditions such as air pollution and the threat posed by climate
changes.<P>

20.  In view of the perceived threat to mountain forests, the European
countries participating in the Strasbourg Ministerial Conference on Forest
Protection in Europe (1990) adopted a resolution on adapting the management of
mountain forests to new environmental conditions.  This has led to closer
collaboration among scientists, practitioners, administrators and legislators
on the protection and management of mountain forests, at both national and
international levels, and to a review of legislation and increased funding in
some countries. <P>

21.  So far, however, chapter 13 of Agenda 21 has not had a significant
direct influence on policies and programmes of developed countries.  However,
Japan enacted the "Law concerning the Promotion of the Improvement of Basic
Conditions of Agriculture, Forestry and other Businesses in Hilly and
Mountainous Areas" in June 1993, and Italy enacted the "New Law for Mountain
Areas" in January 1994.  There is an increasing understanding in
industrialized countries of the need for maintaining mountain populations
where they live, in order to ensure sustainable natural resource management
and production systems (through subsidies and provision of infrastructure and
services), preserve mountain cultures and traditions and prevent and combat
forest fires. <P>

22.  Support for national development agendas had not yet materialized.  It
is expected that the regional intergovernmental workshops planned in
preparation for a proposed world conference on sustainable mountain
development in 1997 (see para. 75 below) will alert Governments and national
agencies to the needs and potential for special national mountain agendas.  So
far chapter 13 of Agenda 21 has received very limited attention at national
level. <P>


          <CENTER>                 2.  Developing countries</CENTER><P>

23.  Two conditions make urban migration away from the mountains in
developing countries very different from urban migration elsewhere.  First,
the weak economies of developing countries cannot absorb migrants, many of
whom end up in peri-urban slums, and secondly, mountain population densities
remain high (relative to carrying capacity and conservation needs) and in many
cases are growing.<P>

24.  Developing country institutions dealing with mountain development are
new compared with, for example, some of the European torrent and avalanche
control services dating back more than 100 years.  In addition they are
usually understaffed and lack adequate long-term funding. <P>

25.  Exceptions to this general rule may be found in recent developments in
Colombia and Lesotho.  In Colombia, the Regional Autonomous Corporations,
created by Act No. 99 of 1993, have been made responsible for environmental
management.  The great majority of these Corporations are situated in the
Andes, thus providing a high degree of autonomy to the mountain areas of the
country.  In Lesotho, the Highland Water Development Scheme, which involves
the construction of four major dams and water conduits for the sale of water
to South Africa constitutes the most important investment and potential
sustainable income earner for the country, which is all mountainous.  The
state of Himachal Pradesh in India has made significant progress in economic
development by transforming a subsistence food production economy into a
market economy based on opportunities for horticultural development in a
mountain environment.<P>

26.  Several developing countries have made significant progress in
participatory rural development and watershed management in the uplands,
compared with the industrialized countries in temperate zones.  The main
reason is that the mountain areas in tropical and subtropical countries are
often densely populated in areas where farming, even at altitudes higher than
3,000 metres above sea level, is still possible.  The participatory techniques
in community forestry, soil and water conservation and watershed management
include grass-roots participation and bottom-up planning methods, which are
currently being applied in a large number of programmes in a variety of
situations. 4/<P>

27.  In general, although a wide range of activities are ongoing in mountain
areas in developing countries, few if any, can be considered as being
initiated or strengthened as follow-up to chapter 13 of Agenda 21.  On the
other hand, several initiatives, although not a direct follow-up to
chapter 13, have the potential to become the first steps towards a
comprehensive "national mountain agenda".  The Government of Viet Nam is
developing a strategy for the uplands and watersheds inhabited by ethnic
minorities.  Other countries have relevant past experiences such as Ethiopia
(Highlands Rehabilitation), Morocco (rural development in the province of
Azilal), and Guinea (Fouta Djallon).  Much remains to be done, however, to
create awareness among developing country planners and policy makers of the
potential for mountain development and the specific requirements related to
mountains.<P>


       <CENTER>           3.  Countries with economies in transition</CENTER><p>

28.  The problems related to mountain areas of countries with economies in
transition are in many ways similar to those of industrialized countries. 
Urban migration and neglect of forest management interventions, however, are
further exacerbated by the very high levels of air pollution, structural
changes that have affected institutional capacity, and limited experience with
multisectoral participatory planning.<P>

29.  As a follow-up to the Strasbourg and Helsinki Ministerial Conferences on
Forest Protection in Europe, the Czech Republic has convened two international
meetings on the protection of watershed forests affected by air pollution.  In
1993, acting on the recommendation of those meetings, the Government of Poland
organized a national conference on environmental threats to the Western
Sudeten forests.  A proposal has been made to establish a centre for the
restoration of degraded mountain environments in Hercynian mountains.<P>


    <CENTER>   B.  Experience of major groups and non-governmental organizations
</CENTER><p>
                              <CENTER>    1.  Farmers</CENTER><P>

30.  Farmers in the mountains include members of indigenous communities and
subsistence farmers practising shifting cultivation.  There are small-scale
family farms, medium- and large-scale plantations (forest, fruit trees) and
livestock farms and enterprises.  Geographically consolidated mountain farm
units with legal title to land are relatively rare.  Instead, the income of
the farm family is generally based on a great variety of activities, including
livestock, mixed cropping from several small scattered plots, gathering of
forest products, hunting and fishing, off-farm employment, cottage industries
and handicrafts and tourism. <P>

31.  Because of the multi-faceted sources of income of mountain farmers,
traditional sectoral extension services have not usually reached them, either
because of their remoteness and scattered locations, or because the production
units in each production line (coffee, tea, grains, livestock, fruit) are
considered too small.  In addition, because of the generally insecure income
and land tenure situation, they have not usually qualified for normal credit
schemes.  Mountain farming furthermore relies on the exploitation of highly
variable and complex ecological niches, where local knowledge is often
superior to what extension agents can offer based on research and experience
derived from extensive lowland farming systems.  Without increased research
geared to their specific requirements (such as the work carried out by the
International Potato Centre (CIP) of the Consultative Group on International
Agricultural Research (CGIAR), among others), mountain production systems are
unlikely to benefit from further extension services.<P>

32.  Some progress is being made to overcome the above problems through
special upland integrated development programmes involving group credits,
multi-purpose extension agents at the village level, forest occupancy
agreements, farmers' associations and the like.  Much needs to be done,
however, to further develop promising experiences of past and existing pilot
schemes and demonstration projects, and apply the lessons learnt.<P>

33.  The dramatic increases in agricultural production following the "green
revolution" and the privatization of agriculture in countries with centrally
planned economies have not significantly benefited mountain farmers.  The
agricultural services and secure land tenure available to lowland farmers are
generally not available to upland farmers, whose needs are different.  Much of
the green revolution technology does not work properly in uplands and in areas
lacking improved access.  Although a few practices, such as stall feeding of
animals, planting of leguminous trees and vegetative barriers against erosion,
have general application, local solutions of an integrated nature are usually
required.<P>


                      <CENTER>   2.  Women, children and youth</CENTER><P>

34.  The number of migrant labourers originating in mountain areas -
practically every family in the Atlas Mountains of Morocco and in the Maloti
Mountains of Lesotho has a male family member working elsewhere - and the high
birth rates in some already densely populated mountain areas (the Andes and
the Himalayas in particular) make women a particularly important group to be
involved in the design and implementation of mountain development programmes.<P>

35.  Frequently, when the male head of household is away, the women who are
left behind to manage the family, the animals and the land do not have the
necessary authority to make decisions.  In other situations, women cannot
participate in meetings away from the home or find it impossible to face the
prospect of further investment of their time and efforts because they are
already overloaded with responsibilities.<P>

36.  Some Governments and development agencies are starting to address these
issues by making sure that women participate in programme design from the very
early stages, although they often fail to make adequate provision for the
additional initial efforts, and therefore costs.  On the other hand, mountain
women, once organized, and perceiving that they are able to benefit, are often
very active in development activities despite their busy schedule.  Increased
sensitivity to gender issues among development workers and experts is urgently
required.<P>

37.  The FAO/Italy Interregional Project for Participatory Upland
Conservation and Development commenced work simultaneously in five countries
in 1991 (Bolivia, Burundi, Nepal, Pakistan and Rwanda).  In all cases the
international project design team consisted of a male and a female member, and
had a period of three months in which to design the project, in consultation
with the watershed populations following a participatory rural appraisal in
order to ensure adequate representation by all groups.  During the first two-
year phase of the programme, this led to a series of local initiatives, which
during the following three-year phase are being closely monitored and are
gradually finding their niche in the evolving multi-stakeholder plan for the
watershed.  This process represents a complete turnaround from traditional
regional planning by government agencies in order to define action programmes
often seen as of low priority by the local people.<P>

38.  The general situation remains, however, in which mountain families are
split for long periods because of the need for income from outside employment.<P>

Young people are leaving the mountains to look for a better future elsewhere
or are involved in such activities as herding, mining or forestry, which take
them away from home for extended periods.  Children at an early age are forced
to attend to grazing livestock, fetching water, fuelwood and fodder, and
looking after younger siblings, instead of attending school (if a school
exists).  As a result, school drop-out rates are exceedingly high in mountain
regions.  The challenge in basic education programmes is to adopt approaches
that recognize these realities and design programmes that are relevant to the
local situation.  Not enough has been done to help children and youth to
recognize the potentials and constraints of their environment and to take
action, together with teachers and parents, for achieving a better livelihood.<P>

39.  Although the World Bank in one of its recent annual reports has
identified rural women in developing countries as the investment target with
the highest potential, financial and other allocations to women, particularly
to women in the mountains, remain totally inadequate.  The difficulties and
obstacles to achieving a greater role for mountain women, a greater
contribution from them and their overall participation are formidable.  Girls
are not encouraged to pursue education beyond primary school and, because of
their multiple responsibilities, often remain illiterate as well as culturally
constrained in making their opinions known when men are present.  Many
mountain women speak only the local language, which is often not the official
language of the nation let alone an international language.  The
recommendations of the International Conference on Population and Development
specifying measures to be taken for the empowerment, equity and equality of
women, and to eliminate discrimination against the girl child, represent the
most recent international agreements concerning the status of girls and
women. 5/  They should also be implemented in mountain areas.<P>

40.  While the involvement of mountain women in the process of achieving
sustainable development is strategically important and can be cost-effective,
in many cases completely new ways of working with communities are needed. 
Participatory methods in soil conservation and community forestry increasingly
include drawing, dancing and performing plays, which enable women to express
their opinions and needs.  Further development and large-scale application of
such methods are seen as indispensable if real progress is to be achieved.<P>


                   <CENTER>          3.  Indigenous people</CENTER><P>

41.  Armed conflicts and other problems involving mountain communities have
been given extensive coverage by the mass media and with it some attention to
the issue of mountain development as well as the situation of indigenous
mountain populations.  However, although armed conflicts make more headlines
and indeed represent immense human suffering, it is probably the more gradual
encroachment on the mountains by displaced lowland people that has had the
most serious impact on indigenous mountain communities over the past four
decades.  The devastating effects of short-fallow shifting cultivation are
often not the work of mountain people, but of landless lowland farmers moving
farther up into mountain areas as squatters in search of "unoccupied" land and
applying lowland production techniques unsuited to complex upland realms.<P>

42.  Sustainable mountain development in many places has to start with a
change in attitude towards indigenous people and in the way they are treated. 
Their right to the land should be recognized, as should their knowledge of the
special living conditions and natural resource management in the mountains. 
They should be protected from exploitation by drug dealers, tourist operators
and guerrilla movements.  In many countries this involves extremely sensitive
issues.  However, some progress is being made involving official granting of
land titles, granting of partial autonomy, teaching in local languages and so
forth.  New development models involving indigenous mountain people are
appearing; they are badly needed.<P>


                   <CENTER>   4.  Non-governmental organizations</CENTER><P>

43.  Non-governmental organizations, including the International Mountain
Society (IMS), and people with close NGO contacts working in intergovernmental
institutions such as ICIMOD were instrumental and in some instances played a
decisive role in ensuring that a special chapter on mountains (chapter 13) was
included in Agenda 21 and approved by UNCED.  This is recognized in
chapter 13, in which it is stated that national Governments and
intergovernmental organizations should:<P>

         "(a)  Coordinate regional and international cooperation and
     facilitate an exchange of information and experience among the
     specialized agencies, the World Bank, IFAD and other international and
     regional organizations, national Governments, research institutions and
     non-governmental organizations working on mountain development;<P>

         (b)   Encourage regional, national and international networking of
     people's initiatives and the activities of international, regional and
     local non-governmental organizations working on mountain development,
     such as the United Nations University (UNU), the Woodlands Mountain
     Institute (WMI), the International Centre for Integrated Mountain
     Development (ICIMOD), the International Mountain Society (IMS), the
     African Mountain Association and the Andean Mountain Association,
     besides supporting those organizations in exchange of information and
     experience". 6/<P>

44.  International NGOs, such as the World Conservation Union (IUCN), support
national and local activities ranging from the formulation of national
environmental and forestry action plans, and the establishment of protected
areas and national parks, to indigenous people and local user groups, among
others.  This work is carried out in collaboration with Governments and
intergovernmental organizations, as well as with national and local NGOs.<P>

45.  National level NGOs play an increasingly important role in mountain
development programmes.  The Aga Khan Rural Support Programme in Pakistan, the
King Mahendra Trust for Nature Conservation in Nepal, and the Fundacio'n
Peruana para la Conservacio'n de la Naturaleza in Peru are but a few examples.<P>

46.  The number of local NGOs supporting mountain communities has greatly
increased, as recognition of and hence support for, their role has gained
ground.  The increased flow of information to and between local level NGOs has
improved the quality of their activities and, in many instances, has helped to
clarify their partnership role in development efforts alongside decentralized
government agencies.<P>


         <CENTER>        C.  Matters related to finance and technology</CENTER><P>

                            <CENTER>      1.  Finance</CENTER><P>

47.  Sustainable mountain development is still almost entirely financed on an
ad hoc project rather than programme basis.  Mountains have not yet been the
object of special financial mechanisms, although such arrangements would be
entirely justified.  Mountains do not have an equivalent to the TFAP or an
international convention with a financing mechanism such as the Global
Environment Facility (GEF).  The many attempts to link the construction of
large dams and the sale of hydroelectricity and irrigation water with the
financing of integrated watershed conservation and development have remained
largely frustrated.  Recently, however, both the Inter-American Development
Bank and the World Bank have become increasingly interested in environmental
issues related to natural resources conservation (forests and water) in
watershed and mountain areas.<P>

48.  Mountain areas are very often poor, not because they do not produce, but
because they do not obtain a fair price for their products and services. 
These include water, forest products and services, tourism and recreation,
mining, special upland crops, fruits and animal products (ranging from milk
and cheese to clothing and carpets).<P>

49.  One of the main sustainable sources of income for mountain areas would
appear to be based on new developments concerning water tariffs.  Lesotho is
at present engaged in a major highland water scheme that will enable the
country to sell water to South Africa.  This will be one of the first cases of
a major financial arrangement in which the value of water as a scarce natural
resource will be recognized.  Most existing water tariffs are based only on
the need to recover the costs of dam construction and delivery systems for
example, water being considered a free - unlimited - natural resource.<P>

50.  Colombia has for several years applied a financial mechanism for
watershed management and upland rural electrification based on a special tax
of 4 per cent (now changed to 6 per cent) on the bulk sale of
hydroelectricity.<P>

51.  At the national level, a new and hard look needs to be taken at the
overall flow of resources and services to and from mountain areas, including
water, forest and range products, labour, and government services.  New or
revised water tariffs, forest and mining royalties, grazing rights and leases,
marketing of medicinal herbs and other non-wood forest products, fees for
access to national parks and licences for tourism operations are all possible
income earners for development action benefiting mountain communities, which
would in turn allow these communities to invest in, and not receive as
government hand-outs, housing, communication, roads, education and nutrition.<P>

52.  Mountain areas can benefit, and in some cases are benefiting, from
programmes financed by GEF.  GEF, however, is not at present oriented towards
mountain development as such, although the international conventions on
climate change and biological diversity are important in relation to mountain
areas.  Other categories eligible for GEF financing, such as international
waters and land degradation, are often also pertinent to mountains.  Further
consideration should be given to financing relevant aspects of mountain
development programmes by GEF or other financial mechanisms.<P>

53.  In relation to Capacity 21 the special programme of the United Nations
Development Programme (UNDP) for strengthening country capacity for the
implementation of UNCED decisions), the creation or strengthening of regional
and national capacity for the identification and formulation of sustainable
mountain development programmes is badly needed.<P>

54.  Technical support services at the programme level (TSS-1), a new
financial mechanism for UNDP-financing of technical support provided by United
Nations specialized agencies, is a potentially useful mechanism for the
formulation of mountain development programmes.  A UNDP/FAO TSS-1 project in
Viet Nam on Watershed Management and Ethnic Minorities, has been useful in
improving the design of participatory watershed management projects.<P>

55.  Whether it be done in relation to GEF or as part of TFAP on Capacity 21,
for example, there is a real and urgent need to define and create special
financial facilities for sustainable mountain development.  Such financing
need not necessarily involve huge amounts of funding but should be long term,
dependable and flexible.  As the present report demonstrates, many national
and international organizations have programmes in mountain areas, and in fact
a great deal of money is already being spent on activities involving mountain
areas.  What appears to be needed is a more systematic approach to investment
in mountain areas - in short, programmes involving mountains should be
supplemented with "mountain programmes".<P>

56.  As a starting point it is proposed to establish one or several "mountain
facilities", as small grants funds or multi-donor trust funds, for example. 
This would allow mountainous developing countries to identify action required
under a "national mountain development action programme" and to seek
international support for the implementation of such a programme.  In the
immediate future, increased international funding would be needed to establish
pilot projects under such national programmes and significantly increase
support for applied and operational research in mountain areas, national and
international networking, communication, exchange of experiences and the like.<P>

Long-term commitments might be generated through the formulation and
negotiation of a non-legally binding mountain charter and through regional or
subregional mountain conventions.<P>

                     <CENTER>           2.  Technology</CENTER><P>

57.  Mountain areas have benefited from the preparation and implementation of
national forestry master plans or national forestry action plans in the
framework of TFAP, the Man and the Biosphere (MAB) programme of the United
Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), national
environmental action plans and the FAO International Scheme for Conservation
and Rehabilitation of African Lands, for example.  However, without a specific
focus on mountain issues, mountain areas often find themselves at the back of
the queue, with the possible exception of forestry activities, when programme
implementation gets under way because of the difficulty of access, lack of
basic information (soil surveys, socio-economic parameters) and the need for
local comprehensive solutions based on slow participatory processes.<P>

58.  Available sources of information on appropriate technology to promote
the sustainable development of mountain areas include libraries and databases
of FAO, ICIMOD, CIP and other centres of CGIAR, and the World Conservation
Monitoring Centre (WCMC).  The existing information is accessible to, but not
widely disseminated in, developing countries.<P>

59.  Road construction in mountain areas, although recognized as a major
environmental problem, is still of an unsatisfactory quality in most
developing countries.  The difference between construction standards of
mountain roads in industrialized countries and those in developing countries
is greater than would be expected from the differences in costs.  The
situation is compounded by the fact that poorly constructed mountain roads
usually require much higher maintenance costs, and are often ecologically and
even culturally damaging.<P>

60.  Mining in mountain areas, while potentially an important income-earner,
has a history of negative environmental and social impacts.  Often mountain
communities do not have the necessary financial and technical capacity to
establish and manage mining operations, and yet as labourers, mountain people
suffer the adverse health impacts of hazardous working conditions, as well as
the consequences of the strong fluctuations in demand and prices of metals and
minerals on the world market.  Progress is needed in three areas:  ensuring
that an increasing share of mining royalties benefits the local populations;
increased social security and health benefits for mining workers; and the
mitigation of environmental impacts of mining operations.<P>

61.  Urban development in the mountains presents special challenges regarding
water supply, air pollution and sewage and waste disposal, among other things.<P>

Lack of space may force construction on unstable sites or in areas that should
be conserved for water supply catchments on routing of flood waters.  This in
turn may increase the adverse impact of phenomena such as landslides,
mudflows, flash floods or prolonged drought.<P>

62.  Traditional irrigation technology in mountain areas has been eclipsed by
modern dam construction and the rapid development of large downstream
irrigation schemes, generally inappropriate for mountain areas.  There is an
urgent need to rediscover and re-apply such traditional technologies as the
Andean irrigation techniques developed by the Incas as well as mountain
civilizations in other regions.  Generally speaking, irrigation in the
mountains, based on small-scale appropriate technology, is far more
sustainable than the large-scale irrigation schemes in hot climates
downstream, with the possible exception of the flood-irrigated lowlands in
monsoon climates in Asia.<P>

63.  A major development in government policy concerning mountain communities
is the increased understanding of the importance of local control over natural
resource management and security of resources, especially land tenure, as the
main incentives for investment in environmentally sound technologies and
improved land husbandry.  Much needs to be done, however, before the
confidence mountain people lost because of past policies of sweeping
nationalizations, concessions to outsiders with limited control and punitive
attitudes towards small farmers practising hillside agriculture can be
completely restored.<P>

64.  Tourism in mountain areas is still far from fulfilling its potential
contribution to the local mountain economies.  Positive examples exist in
Austria (Tyrol) and in Italy (Trento Autonomous Province) and other mountain
areas where the benefits of tourism have had a direct impact on the local
household economies, and have practically eliminated poverty in such areas. 
In other areas, tourism has had severe social and cultural as well as
ecological impacts.  Bhutan is seeking to keep tourism within ecologically and
culturally "safe limits" by, among other things, restricting the number of
visitors.  Regarding developing countries in general, it is worth remembering
that (a) not all mountain areas benefit from tourism - it cannot, therefore,
be considered a solution available to all mountain communities - and (b)
institutional and financial mechanisms are usually insufficient to ensure
local participation in and control over the "tourist industry" in the
community.<P>

65.  While it is true in general that development, in order to achieve
sustainability, should take a new and careful look at traditional cultures,
practices and skills, this is particularly so in mountain ecosystems and
cultures.  The attraction of mountain tourism is mainly based on two aspects: 
the mountain landscape and the culture of the people.  The cultural knowledge
of mountain people includes engineering (construction of houses, trails,
bridges, terraces, irrigation canals, water harvesting and spreading systems);
animal husbandry (sheep, goats, camels, yaks and llamas and their products,
including clothing, carpets and cheese), traditional dress, dances, songs,
musical instruments; rules and regulations for local government and land and
water allocation; traditional medicines, medicinal herbs; forest and range
products, including a wide range of food sources (mushrooms, berries, roots,
leaves, tubers).  Sustainable development of mountain ecosystems must build on
this knowledge, bearing in mind three aspects:  the richness of accumulated
traditional mountain cultures; the rate at which this knowledge is
disappearing; and the need for the application of state-of-the-art technology
(in communication, mountain engineering, energy, risk mapping and early
warning systems, local resource management and local government) to enable
mountain communities to make a "leap forward", applying modern technology with
as much as possible of the traditional culture still intact.<P>

66.  Some progress has been made.  Government and development agencies are
increasingly aware that the limiting factors in sustainable mountain
development are not only lack of "assistance" (technical, medical, food), but
also lack of "empowerment" (land titles, local autonomy, generation of
income).  Some Governments have not only restored land titles to indigenous
mountain communities, but have also paid compensation for past damages (in the
case of the Pueblo of Zuni in the United States of America, for example).<P>

67.  A wealth of new research collaboration involving cooperative
arrangements between international institutions and local research
organizations has appeared in recent years.  CONDESAN is one example.  Others
include the use of Worldwatch Institute volunteers in mountain ecology
research in Eastern Europe; and the work carried out by TMI in Bolivia, China,
Nepal and Peru; the collaboration between the United Nations University (UNU)
and IMS and the establishment and strengthening of regional mountain
associations.  On the intergovernmental side, the creation of ICIMOD in 1983,
the recent establishment of the Centre for International Forestry Research
(CIFOR), at Bogor, Indonesia, the African Highlands programme of ICRAF and the
special emphasis on mountains in the programmes of CIP open up new
possibilities for support for local mountain research.<P>

                 cooperation<P>

                    <CENTER>    1.  Intergovernmental processes</CENTER><P>

68.  Several European countries are in the process of revising their forest
laws and regulations, especially regarding mountain forests.  The Strasbourg
Ministerial Conference on Forest Protection in Europe (1990) adopted a
resolution on adapting the management of mountain forests to new environmental
conditions.  A permanent institutional mechanism for follow-up to this
resolution, coordinated by Portugal, has been found in the FAO European
Forestry Commission Working Party on the Management of Mountain Watersheds. 
This Working Party, established 42 years ago, with a broad mandate for
integrated development in mountain areas in Europe, has the potential of
becoming a useful regional vehicle for various aspects of chapter 13 as well.<P>

69.  The Alpine Convention, including a Protocol on Mountain Forests, has
been negotiated and is now being ratified by Austria, France, Germany, Italy,
Liechtenstein, Monaco, Slovenia, Switzerland and the European Union.  The
Council of Europe is preparing a "European Charter for the Mountain Regions". <P>

70.  As recommended by the first ad hoc inter-agency meeting on chapter 13 of
Agenda 21 (Rome, March 1994), a series of regional intergovernmental
consultations on the follow-up to chapter 13 are to take place during the
period 1994-1996.  ICIMOD organized the Regional Conference on Sustainable
Development of Fragile Mountain Areas in Asia in December 1994.  The regional
meeting for Latin America and the Caribbean is to be organized by CIP in
April 1995.  The regional meeting for Africa is tentatively scheduled for
October 1995.<P>


     <CENTER>           2.  Organizations of the United Nations system</CENTER><P>

71.  The agencies and organizations present at the first ad hoc inter-agency
meeting had generally one thing in common:  they all had important activities
in mountain areas but no mountain programme as such.  This is especially true
for the United Nations organizations including FAO, IFAD, the United Nations
Environment Programme (UNEP), UNESCO, the United Nations Children's Fund
(UNICEF) and the World Bank, with the exception of UNU, and for the
International Union of Forest Research Organizations, an NGO.  Organizations
with a focus on mountains are those created around mountain issues.  They
include ICIMOD and CIP and such NGOs as IMS and TMI.  Among institutions with
a significant interest in mountains, but not present at the inter-agency
meeting are IUCN (which has had a Mountain Initiative since 1991), the
International Development Research Centre (IDRC), the International Academy of
the Environment, regional international development banks, regional mountain
associations, ICRAF and UNDP.<P>

72.  The organizations present at the inter-agency meeting agreed to
establish an E-mail Network on Mountains, as called for by IACSD.  This has
since been extended to constitute a more complete group of international
organizations concerned with the follow-up to chapter 13.<P>

73.  Based on the recommendation of the inter-agency meeting, TMI convened an
NGO Planning Workshop on the Mountain Agenda in West Virginia, United States
of America, from 22 to 26 July 1994.<P>

74.  FAO has established a Steering Committee on Environment and Sustainable
Development to, among other things, coordinate follow-up for the chapters and
activities of UNCED for which FAO is responsible as Task Manager.  For
chapter 13, a focal point in the Forestry Department has been designated and
an Interdepartmental Mountain Group has been established with the
participation of nine divisions in addition to the Forestry Department.

75.  The first action by FAO, in its role as Task Manager, was to convene the
ad hoc inter-agency meeting on chapter 13 (Rome, 21 and 22 March 1994).  The
meeting was attended by representatives of 13 agencies and non-governmental
organizations. 7/  The meeting agreed that it would be necessary to make a
special effort to move the issue of fragile mountain ecosystems and the
"mountain agenda" higher on the international and national development
agendas.  It was also noted that no readily available or additional resources
had been earmarked for immediate action, as called for in chapter 13.  The
meeting therefore proposed a series of activities aimed at raising awareness
and moving mountain issues higher on the international development agenda. 
FAO, as Task Manager, was requested to seek donor support for preparatory
consultations within a steering committee, as well as a series of regional
workshops leading to a world conference on sustainable mountain development to
be held in late 1995 or early 1996 (now proposed by FAO for 1997).  NGOs were
encouraged to establish cooperative mechanisms among themselves for the
further development of chapter 13 and to make proposals to the Commission on
Sustainable Development at its third session, in April 1995.<P>

76.  Examples of past and ongoing action in mountain areas carried out by
intergovernmental organizations are given below.<P>

77.  Within the CGIAR system, CIP has been designated to coordinate the
follow-up of chapter 13.  CONDESAN is a participatory research consortium for
the identification, promotion, implementation and monitoring of collaborative
activities, including training and information functions.  INFOANDINA is the
communication and information exchange system of CONDESAN, reaching 70,000
people world wide. <P>

78.  FAO is assisting a large number of mountainous countries by providing
policy advice, technical assistance and training.  This includes programmes on
people's participation, with particular attention to the role of women. 
Sophisticated methodologies have been developed - for example, to match crops
to different ecological conditions and to manipulate the vast amount of data
on soils, climate and vegetation of mountain areas.  Participatory approaches
are being developed in soil conservation and land rehabilitation, community
forestry and watershed management and other activities related to upland
conservation and development in mountain areas.  FAO's Agricultural Services
Division together with ICIMOD organized the International Workshop on
Evolution of Hills and Mountain Farming Systems:  Sustainable Development
Policy Implications in Nepal in October 1994.  A similar meeting will be
organized in Ecuador in 1995 in collaboration with CIP.  As Task Manager for
chapter 13, FAO has established a focal point in its Forestry Department and
set up an Interdepartmental Working Group.  Pursuant to the recommendation of
the first ad hoc inter-agency meeting, FAO's Director-General has called for
donors to support the proposed world conference on sustainable mountain
development in 1997.<P>

79.  The United Nations Centre for Human Settlements (Habitat) is becoming
involved with mountain issues through projects dealing with water resources
management and the mitigation of flood disasters.  A publication on human
settlement issues in the sustainable development of mountain areas is planned.<P>

80.  ICRAF is launching the African Highlands Ecoregional Initiative, with
the overall goal of helping communities in the densely populated and
intensively cultivated highlands of eastern and central Africa, in order to
alleviate poverty and related social and environmental problems.  About 10
national and international research institutions are involved in this project
including the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT), based
in Mexico; CIP, based in Peru; the International Crops Research Institute for
the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT), based in India; and the International
Livestock Centre for Africa (ILCA), based in Ethiopia.<P>

81.  UNEP has been specially concerned with mountains since 1985 through its
programme on Andean ecosystem management and regional workshops on mountains. 
UNEP will contribute especially to chapter 13, programme area A, objective
(b):  "To maintain and generate database and information systems to facilitate
the integrated management and environmental assessment of mountain
ecosystems".  It contributed to the NGO Planning Workshop on the Mountain
Agenda in July 1994 and the Regional Conference on Sustainable Development of
Fragile Mountain Areas in Asia, organized by ICIMOD in December 1994 and will
contribute to the conference of intergovernmental and non-governmental
organizations scheduled for February 1995 and other international meetings on
sustainable mountain development.  A publication in the Environmental
Management Guidelines series, The Integrated Management of Mountain Ecosystems
is being finalized. <P>

82.  UNESCO contributed to the activities of the "mountain agenda" group
through a trust fund contribution from Germany.  Activities in the field of
sustainable mountain development are mainly carried out within the framework
of the MAB programme (more than 40 per cent of all biosphere reserves
recognized under MAB are located in mountain areas); the International
Hydrological Programme (IHP), which addresses specifically the hydrology of
mountainous areas; earth science programmes such as the International
Geological Correlation Programme (IGCP), which focuses on geological factors
controlling the global environment; and programmes related to the
International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction, which address the
vulnerability of, for example, landslide-prone areas using appropriate
technologies such as remote sensing and geographic information systems.  A
synthesis of MAB research in mountains of western and eastern Europe
(including the former Soviet Union) was published in the third quarter of
1994.  A similar synthesis for tropical mountains is in preparation.<P>

83.  UNICEF is represented and active in many mountain countries, especially
because mountain people are amongst the most vulnerable, with high child
mortality rates.  A study on children and poverty in mountains is in
preparation.  As a follow-up to Agenda 21, the UNICEF Executive Board, in
1993, formally adopted a policy to integrate primary environmental care (PEC)
in all UNICEF-assisted programmes.  Special attention is to be devoted to
mountain areas and other ecologically stressed and vulnerable areas, and
greater efforts are to be made in reaching the poorest, whose livelihood has
been seriously affected by resource degradation.<P>

84.  The UNU mountain programme was initiated in 1978 under the title
"Project on highland-lowland interactive systems" and subsequently renamed
"Mountain ecology and sustainable development".  Its objectives are to train
scholars, carry out scholarly and applied research, disseminate results and
develop an international mountain network.  UNU was a major partner, together
with IMS, ICIMOD and others in the preparation and dissemination of the two
main publications on mountains issued in preparation for UNCED - The State of
the World's Mountains:  A Global Report, and An Appeal for the Mountains.  <P>

85.  The mountain research initiated by UNU has involved extensive field
studies in the Himalayas, Thailand, south-west China, the Andes, Ethiopia and
Kenya.  The work has included studies on natural and man-made mountain
hazards, human impacts and human environmental perceptions.  Each sub-project
has also contributed to the training of young scholars in the host countries. 
Especially important is the series of challenges to conventional environmental
wisdom and the insistence on respect for the indigenous environmental
intelligence of the subsistence farmer.  In particular, this has led to a
deeper understanding of the relationship between deforestation in mountain
areas by subsistence farmers (especially in the Himalayas) and downstream
devastation on the plains (especially Gangetic India and Bangladesh).  The
work has been backed up by a long series of regional and international
conferences and training programmes, and the publication of their proceedings
in the UNU journal, Mountain Research and Development, and other forms.  This
enabled UNU, in conjunction with IMS, ICIMOD and others, with funding by the
Swiss Development Cooperation, to formulate "Mountain Agenda 1992" and so play
a major role in ensuring the passage of chapter 13 as part of Agenda 21.  The
primary ongoing activity involves a major study of a Central Asian mountain
transect, including the Pamirs-Tajikistan-Karakoram-Himalayas-Tibetan
Plateau-Hengduan Mountains.  This is linked with work being undertaken by two
major German programmes, the National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) of
France, ICIMOD, the Ford Foundation and UNICEF.<P>

86.  The World Bank is providing loans to Governments for carrying out about
50 projects specifically in mountain areas, some of which are using highly
innovative approaches.  Three main areas of challenge have been identified: 
recognition of mountains as ecosystems; culture in mountain ecosystems; and
finance and support for action.<P>


        <CENTER>      3.  Organizations outside the United Nations system</CENTER><P>

87.  The role of NGOs in the follow-up to chapter 13 was confirmed at the
first ad hoc inter-agency meeting, which recommended that NGOs initiate a
consultative process on the "mountain agenda" and make proposals to the
Commission on Sustainable Development.  In response to that recommendation,
TMI convened the NGO Workshop on the Mountain Agenda (West Virginia, United
States of America, 22-26 July 1994), where detailed plans were made for a
global conference of intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations on
the follow-up to chapter 13, to be held at Lima in February 1995, in time to
make proposals for the third session of the Commission, in April 1995.  The
Workshop also concluded that NGOs would cooperate with Governments in the
implementation of chapter 13, as approved by UNCED.<P>

88.  It is anticipated that following the interest and constructive
commitment of international NGOs, national and local NGOs will become directly
involved in the follow-up to chapter 13.  Their participation will be
increasingly important as implementation of decisions related to the chapter
moves from meeting rooms to the field.<P>

89.  The International Centre for Alpine Environment (ICALPE) is an
independent, international organization which, since 1987, constitutes a
permanent scientific basis for research, management and policy actions on
environmental and other matters in the mountain regions of Europe, including
eastern Europe and the Russian Federation.<P>

90.  ICIMOD has the potential to play a key role in implementing chapter 13. 
It has a strong regional focus (the Hindu Kush-Himalayas region), but a global
conceptual orientation.  There is a high degree of coincidence between ICIMOD
activities and Agenda 21.  The Centre has stepped up the process of promoting
collaboration in many different fields of key importance to sustainable
mountain development.  In 1994 alone, 10 workshops and seminars were held,
during which scientists and development workers from its eight member
countries identified key issues of common interest, and case studies,
guidelines and manuals were developed as well as on-farm research and
demonstration sites in six countries of the Hindu Kush-Himalayas.  In
connection with its tenth anniversary, ICIMOD organized an International
Symposium on Mountain Environment and Development in December 1993.<P>

91.  IMS had a major role in the "mountain agenda" group promoting the
mountain cause and in the inclusion of the chapter on mountains in Agenda 21. 
Much of the present knowledge and clarifications in the discussion on
mountains have been developed in partnership arrangements between IMS, UNU,
IUCN, UNESCO and ICIMOD.  The journal Mountain Research and Development and
the International Mountain Network Newsletter could be used as a basis for
chapter 13 networks.  The President of IMS is currently Chairman of the
International Geographical Union's Commission on Mountain Geoecology.  Ongoing
activities include involvement in a research pilot project of the Yunnan
Academy of Social Sciences, China, with support from the Ford Foundation, and
UNU/IMS support for the establishment and growth of regional mountain
associations:  African Mountains Association, East Asia/Pacific Mountain
Association and Andean/Latin American Mountain Association.<P>

92.  IUCN is involved in supporting national and international mountain
initiatives, including the protection of mountain regions through the
establishment of national parks and other protected areas.  Since 1991, it has
had a Vice-Chairman for Mountains in its Commission on National Parks and
Protected Areas (covering a network of 180 managers and researchers) and a
staff person with part-time responsibilities for mountains.  Activities
include support for the establishment of the Karakorum National Park in
Pakistan and the evaluation of several of the world's most outstanding
mountain parks for inclusion in UNESCO's World Heritage List.  The total
number of mountain protected areas on the List is now 31.<P>
     
93.  The programmes of TMI focus on ecosystem conservation, education and
economic opportunity for mountain people and "sacred" mountains, linking
culture and natural resource management practices.  The Institute was
established 20 years ago.  Its main achievements are in the areas of base-line
surveys and biological databases; applied technology; people and wildlife
interactions; mountain agriculture, non-timber forest resources and crafts;
training and capacity-building; institutional development; cultural research
and preservation, including archaeology; and innovative partnership.  TMI
organized the highly successful NGO Planning Workshop on the Mountain Agenda
in July 1994, laying the foundation for the global conference of
intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations in February 1995.<P>


     <CENTER>             III.  CONCLUSIONS AND PROPOSALS FOR ACTION </CENTER><P>

                    <CENTER>            A.  Conclusions</CENTER><P>

94.  Chapter 13 of Agenda 21 (Managing fragile ecosystems:  sustainable
mountain development) is recognized, not only by Governments and inter-
governmental organizations, but also by the international mountain NGO
community, as the basic plan of action for the "mountain agenda".<P>

95.  The ad hoc inter-agency meeting on chapter 13 convened by the Task
Manager, FAO, in March 1994, and the NGO Planning Workshop on the Mountain
Agenda convened by TMI in July 1994, have produced a productive cooperative
network of intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations concerned with
sustainable mountain development.  There is agreement that a political and
economic "mountain lobby" needs to be generated, enabling mountain people to
fully demonstrate their potential contribution to sustainable development,
with a thorough understanding of the specificity of mountain issues, similar
to that for small island developing States. <P>

96.  The "mountain agenda" therefore includes the launching of a process of
preparation of a number of initiatives, particularly through the organization
of regional consultations, leading to a major global consultation on
sustainable mountain development, including a follow-up plan of action. 
Multi-donor support and host and sponsoring countries are needed.<P>

97.  One of the main difficulties encountered so far is the lack of adequate
recognition of mountain areas as something special, with common problems not
shared by lowlands, and therefore worthy of special attention.  The fragility
of mountain ecosystems and the adverse impact of the degradation of those
ecosystems on lowland populations have not been fully appreciated.  This is
reflected in the lack of mountain programmes of agencies, but maybe even more
so at the national level, where it is still rare to find departments,
programmes or legislation, dealing in a comprehensive way with mountain
issues.  More often than not mountain areas and populations are at the "thin
end" of general national programmes of education, health and infrastructure,
mainly because the cost per person of providing such services in remote
mountain areas is above the national average and therefore seen by sectoral
agencies as uneconomical, and because mountain communities often lack the
necessary economic and political influence.<P>

98.  The empowerment, equity and equality of mountain women should receive
priority attention, together with improved services related to women's
specific needs, reproductive health and nutrition; education aimed at closing
existing literacy gaps between boys and girls, and between men and women; and
ensuring women's access to development and technology transfer programmes.<P>

99.  Sustainable mountain development in many places has to start with a
change in attitude towards indigenous people and in the way they are treated. 
Their right to the land should be recognized, as should their knowledge of the
special living conditions and natural resource management in the mountains,
and they should be protected from exploitation by extractive industries, drug
dealers, tourist operators and guerrilla movements.  The role of children and
youth in sustainable mountain development should also be recognized.  Not only
will they inherit the responsibility of looking after the environment in the
future, but they can also be active supporters of today's endeavour.  Their
interests can best be served by employing a participatory approach that
involves them in the whole process of developing programmes and action plans.<P>

100. A new and hard look needs to be taken at the overall flow of resources
and services to and from mountain areas, including water, forest and range
products, labour and government services.  New or revised water tariffs,
forest and mining royalties, grazing rights and leases, marketing of medicinal
herbs and other non-wood forest products, fees for access to national parks
and licences for tourism operations are all possible income earners for
mountain communities, which would in turn allow these communities to invest
in, and not receive as government hand-outs, housing, communications, roads,
education and nutrition.  Of special interest in financing mountain
development is the increasing recognition of the economic value of water (in
this connection see chapter 18 of Agenda 21 and the Water Resources Management
Policy Papers of the World Bank).<P>

101. Some progress has been made concerning the sustainability of development
in mountain areas.  Government and development agencies are increasingly aware
that the limiting factors in sustainable mountain development is not only lack
of "assistance" (technical, medical, food) but also lack of "empowerment"
(land titles, local autonomy, generation of income).  There is a need to
examine the relationship of chapter 13 with other chapters of Agenda 21 and to
analyse the extent to which the concerns of mountain areas can be better
integrated in the follow-up action on other chapters.  Of equal importance is
the analysis of ongoing programmes of United Nations organizations, including
the World Bank, the CGIAR centres and donor agencies to see how priorities for
mountain areas are reflected.<P>


                  <CENTER>         B.  Proposals for action</CENTER><P>

102. The main proposals for action were identified through a broad
participatory process involving the major NGOs and were made in five areas in
which progress is deemed to be urgently needed:  eradicating poverty;
strengthening a global information network and database; strengthening country
capacity; raising awareness through the preparation and organization of a
world conference on sustainable mountain development; and formulating and
negotiating regional or subregional mountain conventions and possibly
developing a global mountain charter.<P>

103. The estimated average total annual cost of implementing the activities
of chapter 13 made by the Conference secretariat prior to the Conference
should be reviewed by Governments, leading to readily available or additional
resources being earmarked for immediate action, especially action directed
towards eradicating poverty.  It may be recalled that there are already a
number of international, national and local organizations with a mandate in
sustainable mountain development, but with severe limitations of staff and
funding.  Matching their institutional mandate, professional expertise and
proved record with adequate financial support would have a direct measurable
impact in the short and medium term.<P>

104. Support should be provided for strengthening a global information
network and database, as outlined in chapter 13 of Agenda 21, programme area A
(Generating and strengthening knowledge about the ecology and sustainable
development of mountain ecosystems).  A small secretariat should be
established for this purpose.  The proposed lead agency is UNU, in
collaboration with FAO, IMS and TMI, among others.  The network would provide
the linkage between NGOs, regional mountain associations, mountain scholars
and academic institutions, and should ensure the process of bringing increased
understanding of mountain ecosystems, watershed processes and
culture-development processes to decision makers and the public concerned. 
The network would also promote research and monitoring activities at the
grass-roots level.  Databases would enable the preparation of atlases that
highlighted the global and regional role of mountain ecosystems.  Support
would be given to regional assessments and surveys, regional mountain database
and information systems and regional action guidelines, as well as to
monitoring the state of the environment and development of the world's
mountains. <P>

105. Support should be provided for generating country capacity and
formulating national mountain action programmes as outlined in chapter 13 of
Agenda 21, programme area B (Promoting integrated watershed development and
alternative livelihood opportunities).  Initially, a small-grants mountain
facility would be needed to assist countries in formulating and initiating
implementation of sustainable mountain development programmes.  Consideration
should be given to decentralizing decision-making and programme formulation to
the level of administrative units.  Proposed lead agencies are FAO, UNDP,
UNEP, UNICEF and bilateral donors.  Primary environmental care on a watershed
basis could provide a conceptual framework, whereas the planning and
formulation methodologies developed by TFAP could serve as a model for a
country-driven, multi-stakeholder, process-oriented, participatory approach. 
Increased funding for poverty alleviation as a first step towards sustainable
development in mountains is urgently required.<P>

106. The Commission on Sustainable Development may wish to urge interested
countries and organizations to promote initiatives aimed at raising awareness,
including the organization of a world conference on sustainable mountain
development.  Host country and sponsoring countries and agencies would need to
be identified.  It is proposed that such a conference be held early in 1997. 
In preparation for the conference, regional intergovernmental workshops would
be organized.  Non-governmental organizations would be actively involved in
the process.  The three main objectives of the conference would be (a) to
mobilize a political and economic "mountain lobby" capable of demonstrating to
Governments, policy makers and planners the potential contribution of mountain
areas to national and regional development; (b) to introduce the financial and
planning instruments needed to incorporate mountain development into national
plans and budgets; and (c) to examine the specific human, social and
technological characteristics of mountain areas.<P>

107. Support should be provided for the formulation, negotiation and
implementation of regional or subregional mountain conventions and possibly
the formulation of a global mountain charter.<P>

     1/  Report of the United Nations Conference on Environment and
Development, Rio de Janeiro, 3-14 June 1992, vol. I, Resolutions Adopted by
the Conference (United Nations publication, Sales No. E.93.I.8 and
corrigendum), resolution 1, annex II.<P>

     2/  Two main groups of mountainous countries should be considered in
this context - those where mountain people and mountain areas constitute the
main focus of development (Bhutan, Lesotho, Nepal, Yemen), and those where
mountain people and mountain areas are only a part of the national socio-
economic scene (China, Ethiopia, India).<P>

     3/  In terms of poverty and the impact of environmental degradation,
children and women in poor mountain areas constitute the most disadvantaged
and vulnerable groups.  Statistical data point to some of the highest infant
and maternal mortality rates in mountainous regions of developing countries.<P>

     4/  A special situation exists in eastern and southern Africa and on a
more limited scale in other tropical mountainous countries, in the sense that
the uplands, because of their favourable climates and fertile soils, have been
occupied by wealthy farmers and farming enterprises.  These include tea and
coffee estates, forest and fruit tree plantations and cattle and wildlife
farms.  Long-term sustainability of development in such areas appears to be
linked more to socio-political aspects than to environmental considerations,
since these areas are not particularly fragile and soil erosion can be kept
within acceptable limits.  Provided politically acceptable land ownership
patterns and levels of employment can be maintained, these uplands have the
potential for very high production and income-generation levels and for
playing an important role in the national economy.<P>

LAWRENCE S. HAMILTON<P>

BECAUSE of their significant three-dimensional character, mountains and
mountain ranges have a heterogeneity, a fragility, a climate, and a
relative inaccessibility that present special problems in sustainable
development. Moreover they are the living environment for some of the
world's most ancient and traditional peoples, whose rich cultures are
being rapidly eroded. Biodiversity is high because of the variety of
specialised habitats among the differing faces and altitudinal belts of
mountains. Endemism is also high for the same reason, and because many
free-standing mountains are essentially islands. These characteristics
emphasise the need to have very large portions of our mountain heritage
in effectively-managed protected areas, ranging from strict nature
reserves to protected landscapes occupied by humans.<BR>
 <P>      IUCN has long been concerned about the mountain environment.
Current action centres on the Commission for National Parks and
Protected Areas (CNPPA), where since 1992 there has been a Mountain
Theme and a Vice-Chair for Mountains. The CNPPA Newsletter has a
mountain column, and a Mountain Protected Areas UPDATE is sent to 250
scientists and managers. Funding is sought for a Mountain Task Force.
        <P>The CNPPA Vice-Chair represented IUCN with partners who together
succeeded in placing a document and supporting material before the Earth
Summit, and the result was the adoption of a chapter on mountains in
Agenda 21, supported by all nations. He, along with Jim Thorsell,
represents IUCN in the Task Group formed by FAO to carry out the mandate
of this chapter, a Mountain Agenda, and a series of significant meetings
and activities have been stimulated by this group. Coming up, for
instance, are intergovernmental mountain sustainability meetings in
Europe (October 1996), Africa (June 1996) and North America (1997). A
global Mountain Forum for NGOs has been launched, sparked by the
leadership of The Mountain Institute in the USA. Mountain Associations
have been formed for the Andes, Africa, East Asia and the Pacific,
augmenting the existing International Centre for Integrated Mountain
Development which serves the Himalayas, Hindu Kush and Karakoram.
Interest in mountains finally seems to be crystallising and entering
political consciousness. It is important in this sustainable development
scenario that mountain protected areas play their needed role. More
protected areas of various categories are needed to fill in gaps in
biogeographic coverage and to link existing areas in conservation
corridors. In addition, improved management of existing areas is a
necessary accompaniment.<P>
        Some of the characteristics of mountain environments that
mandate special attention to these earth features are alluded to in the
introductory article of this issue of PARKS, along with some suggested
priority topics for conservation action. Other articles deal with: World
Heritage mountains; the sacred aspects of mountains; using the Biosphere
Reserve to achieve mountain conservation in Mexico; a fine example of
transfrontier cooperation between France and Italian protected areas;
the contribution to parks management made by developments in the
Australian Alps; and an update on the innovative institutional (legal)
device of the Alpine Convention in Europe.<P>
        Readers who manage or research in mountain protected areas and
would like to join the Mountain Protected Area Network are invited to

<B>The role of protected areas in sustainable mountain development<P>

LAWRENCE S. HAMILTON<P>

Mountain regions seem to have common problems whether in Bolivia, Switzerland, Nepal or Uganda.  To name a few, they seem characterised by:
<UL>
<LI>Interesting and threatened cultures or livelihood systems
<LI>Narginalization economically, politically and in law enforcement
<LI>Outflow of young people and the skilled or highly educated
<LI>Outflow of raw materials to the lowlands
<LI>Heterogeneous environments due to various elevation zones, directional exposures and soils, and thus not easily masterplanned by recipes which may work in the lowlands
<LI>Ecologically sensitive to a high degree due to erosion, variable climate and extreme climate, and with slow recovery of fauna, vegetation or soils
<LI>High incidence of natural hazards such as avalanches, lava flows, landslides, earthquakes, torrents and rock falls, due to vulcanism, tectonic and topographic processes.
<DD>Any planning exercise for a mountain region as to guiding principles for sustainable development will be difficult because of the complexity of these problems.  Nevertheless, the attempt to draw up such guidelines for harmonious accommodation between nature, culture and economic aspirations is a worthy one.  What follows is at a sub-national regional scale for mountain environments in general, but the focus in examples is mostly on the Andes.</B><P>

WHEN CONFRONTED with the task of identifying 'beauty', it is generally
accepted that 'beauty is in the eye of the beholder'. There is little
agreement,
even when it comes to the natural beauty of the landscape. There is,
however, much more consensus on what is ugly or discordant, or what
constitutes a misfit in human society or in a landscape. Thus it was
that a nationwide campaign for 'natural beauty', instigated by the wife
of the President of the United States (Mrs Johnson) in the 1960s,
focused on reducing the amount of ugliness in the out-of-doors. One of
the most visible targets was the outdoor advertising billboard, and I am
happy to be able to say that I live in a state (Vermont) that was one of
the first to ban these visual blights on the landscape.<P>
        I feel very much that we have the same problem in trying to
identify and describe 'sustainability', which is the current conceptual
goal for local, regional or national planning and development.
Sustainability was the watchword coming from the Earth Charter, Agenda
21 out of the UN Conference on Environment and Development in 1992, and
there is now a global Commission on Sustainable Development charged with
guiding implementation of Agenda 21. The manual Caring for the Earth
(IUCN/UNEP/WWF 1991) is subtitled "A Strategy for Sustainable Living".
Yet there have been few, if any, successful identifications of when the
happy state of environmental sustainability has been reached (Carpenter
1993 and 1995, Cocklin 1989, Orians 1990). But as is true with easier
recognition of the ugly or the misfit, it is far easier to identify and
to measure unsustainability. Then by taking steps to reduce or eliminate
it, to approach a harmonious situation of sustainable use of an
environment such as one in the Andes. This I have called the 'back door'
approach. I would like to explore how this approach might be applied in
five aspects of mountain development, and then highlight eight key areas
of a mountainous landscape which might receive priority attention given
the fact that unlimited human and financial resources are not available
to tackle all elements and locations.<P>
        In many mountain regional planning units there is an underlying
acceptance of the need for: 1) productive, healthy forests; 2) a system
of viable protected areas; 3) sustainable tourism; 4) production of
quality water; and 5) maintenance of cultural values and traditional
lifestyles. Note that these aspects do not include mountain agriculture
or grazing, but the same principle applies. Let me offer some brief
comments on recognising and reducing unsustainability in each of these
facets of mountain development.<P>

<B>Forest Health</B><BR>
The term 'forest health' has come into vogue in the USA rather than
forest sustainability (Society of American Foresters 1994). My opinion
has been strengthened that recognising ill-health is easier, can often
be measured, and points toward action that leads to a healthy forest,
i.e. a sustainable one. A <B>major criterion </B>would be abnormal reductions
in productivity. And here I mean production not only of wood (timber,
fuelwood etc.), but of non-wood plant products such as fruits, medicinal
plants, nuts, mushrooms, resins, bark (for Taxol or other products) etc.
It should also include forest fauna ranging from game to be hunted, to
non-game for enjoyment or as part of the functioning ecosystem (e.g.
ants and earthworms). Where these 'products' are harvested, careful
monitoring of growth, yield and regeneration over long periods of time
is required in order to detect abnormal reduction, for there will always
be fluctuations. Separating overharvest from natural fluctuation, or as
Carpenter (1993) has put it "separating the signal from the background
noise", is the tricky bit and requires all the skill that foresters can
muster. The extreme example of abnormal reduction would of course be
loss or endangerment of a species, and this would indeed be a <B>second
criterion</B> for an unhealthy forest. Early recognition of endangerment is
required if appropriate health restorative measures are to be taken,
e.g. concern about the welfare of the tree species Alerce Fitzroya
cupressoides. A <B>third criterion</B>would be soil erosion, focused on that
caused by human activity in product removal. While some increase in
erosion inevitably accompanies any product removal activity that
destroys the ground cover or disturbs the soil, this must be held to a
minimum, and promptly controlled if it is occurring. Guidelines for
reducing the negative aspects of wood product removal have been produced
and are available (see for instance Hamilton 1987). A <B>fourth criterion</B>
would be evidence of forest decline or death due to pests, or to air
pollution from acid rain, photochemical smog or ozone. Air pollution
damage is not yet a major problem in the Andes but it is in many
mountain areas.<P>
        <B>Other criteria</B> of ill-health would be high rates of nutrient
loss (leaching or removal off-site by erosion, or by short-rotation
total wood removal), and slow or incomplete recovery from disturbance
(Smith 1984). Monitoring will detect these evidences of ill-health, and
curing them or preventing them moves us toward sustainability. Such
monitoring and a concern for sustainability should characterise all
Forest Reserves or National Forests, as protected areas.<P>

<B>A viable system of protected areas</B> <BR>
What would be a viable, adequate, sustainable system of protected areas
in a region, a state or nation? There have been a number of yardsticks
proposed having to do with adequate legislation, percentage of land area
protected (not a good one), coverage of major environments or ecosystems
(a very good one), an adequate protection staff, and so forth. However,
it is easy to be complacent and be satisfied with a system that
superficially looks good on paper, but that has symptoms of ill-health
on the ground. It is therefore important to monitor, to research for the
weak points, the signs of unravelling, the potential problems, and then
initiate course corrections in management or interpretation or policy. A
few examples might be illustrative. Increasing friction or conflict with
neighbours shows up in many ways such as fires, poaching, illegal forest
harvesting, vandalism, or anti-park sentiment that permeates local
politics; these need to be addressed early on, possibly by greater local
involvement in park planning or management, by effective community
meetings, by identification of local benefits to the community and then
informing them, and so forth. A decline in top predators is usually
noticeable as a symptom of failure (an inadequate protected area), but a
decline in amphibians which are an important part of ecosystem
functioning might escape notice unless monitoring is well done. Invasion
by alien species that adversely impact native species is another
indication of an unsustainable situation which needs to be addressed.
Other problems such as trail erosion, air pollution damage, garbage or
litter, conflict between hikers and bikers, are all symptoms of an
unsustainable situation, and need redress. Carrying capacity for
visitors is difficult to determine, but over-use and over-crowding are
recognisable. A very useful publication is IUCN's bulletin <I>Guidelines
for Mountain Protected Areas </I>(Poore 1992), available in English, Spanish
and Russian and in Japanese.<P>

<B>Sustainable nature-based tourism</B><BR>
Tourism has become one of the foremost economic activities around the
world. In developing countries alone tourism generated US$62.5 billion
in 1990 (WTO 1991). In mountainous areas which have often been
economically, socially and politically marginalised with relation to
lowland areas, tourism based on mountain scenic, biological, cultural
and geological resources has often meant economic salvation. Income from
tourism in some mountainous nations is often the first or second earner
of foreign currency. Nepal in 1983 earned US$45 million from visitors
primarily attracted by Himalayan geography, nature and culture, and
Rwanda's few mountain gorillas in Parc National des Volcans before the
recent strife earned the country about US$1 million in entrance fees
(WTO/UNEP 1992). Protected areas are the basis for much of the tourism-
generated benefits (and disbenefits) in a region or nation, and indeed,
under the best of conditions, tourism can serve as a self-financing
mechanism for establishment and maintenance of protected areas ranging
from national parks to cultural landscapes and natural monuments. Within
the underfunded protected area system of Per, Huascarn National Park's
entire budget allocation from Lima is a return of 80% of the amount
collected by a US$1 equivalent entry fee per adult visitor at its two
principal entry stations (personal communication, Ren Valencia,
Huascarn National Park 1995). It is therefore extremely important that
the tourism/protected area situation be a sustainable relationship,
achieving true 'ecotourism' (as the current buzz-word has it).<P>
        Again, I believe that it is more pragmatic and easier to detect
signals of unsustainability. Adequate monitoring and research are key
activities in this process. Many of the negative signals are relatively
obvious, such as declining visitor numbers (unless war, terrorism,
visitor safety problems, economic downturns in the local, national or
world economies, and so forth, are producing a decline in several or all
protected areas). I will mention only a few that occur to me as needing
monitoring and early detection, followed by remedial action. If local
people come to view protected areas as being only for the benefit of
foreigners rather than also for themselves, the resentment spells
trouble. If governments in their desire to maximise economic returns
initiate the hallmarks of mass tourism such as large resort hotels, golf
courses, false cultural extravaganzas and heavy-duty roads, there is
trouble ahead for both the nature and culture bases of sustainable
ecotourism. Most of the signals of non-sustainability have to do with
exceeding a certain carrying capacity, and managers and policy makers
must have the wisdom of Solomon to determine what the various thresholds
are for such aspects as: overcrowding (both quantitative and
qualitative), noise, presence of human infrastructure, safety, and
irreversible site damage. There are ways of increasing carrying capacity
such as by geographic or time dispersal, good design, buffers, and
making the off-season more attractive. But first one must recognise the
problem. Some useful indicators come from visitor satisfaction surveys,
aberrant wild animal behaviour, vegetation or soil damage, rubbish
accumulation, and pollution of air or water (including loss of natural
sounds due to noise pollution). <P>
        A very helpful analysis of protected area tourism has been
prepared with the assistance of IUCN by the World Tourism Organisation
and the United Nations Environment Programme (WTO/UNEP 1992). A very
succinct statement of Principles for Tourism in National Parks has been
published jointly by the English Tourist Board and the Countryside
Commission (ETB/CC 1989). Also helpful in fostering sustainable tourism
are increasing distribution and use of visitor codes of conduct which
have been produced by church groups (New Zealand), environmental
societies (USA) and tourism organisations (World Tourism Organisation).<P>

<B>Water production</B><BR>
Water is one of the most important products of mountain areas, which
generally receive greater rainfall or snowfall than surrounding
lowlands. Mountains are water towers for human society. It is important
that this production be maintained in quantity, timing and quality. It
is true that the natural regime often does not suit the majority of
people downstream in the lowlands, who may receive too much water at
times and too little at others. Interventions have therefore been made
in the form of detention dams for flood reduction or for low flow
augmentation, and these are located in the mountain or foothill valleys.
With human occupancy of natural flood plains and a complex system of
water use in place for domestic, industrial, service, irrigation or
other agricultural use, it is important that mountain land uses do not
unduly impair this production system. Again we approach this from the
back door by recognising symptoms of deterioration or damage, rather
than of sustainability. Activities which drastically reduce vegetative
evapotranspiration (e.g. large scale clear-cutting of forest or land
clearing) increase the quantity of water discharged in the stream or
river coming from the watershed. If low flow is the main problem, this
may be a good thing, but if flooding is a problem, the additional yield
comes at flood time as well. On the other hand, cutting or clearing of
mountain cloud forests (selva de neblina, bosque de ceja) eliminates the
cloud water capture function of these important forests, and results in
less water available. These forests are particularly critical in the
yungas and on the drier western side of the Andes (Stadtmller 1987).
Activities that compact the soil surface, reducing infiltration into the
soil mantle, alter the timing of water flow from the watershed, and
shorten the period between rain event and water discharge, thus
aggravating flash floods. It is important to recognise that both of
these effects on water yield diminish as the size of the watershed
increases. They may be very important in short, small watersheds such as
those coming west out of the Andes, but dwarfed by other factors in
large basins such as the major Amazon tributaries.<P>
        Perhaps the most important criterion of unsustainability is the
presence of human-induced sediment in water courses coming from the
mountains. Much sediment is natural erosion (e.g. natural streambank and
channel erosion), but sediment from human activities in the watershed
adds an undue and largely avoidable burden. Sediment impairs the water
for many uses such as drinking water, irrigation, and provision of
habitat for fish and other aquatic organisms. It also  reduces the
storage capacity of reservoirs, and eventually reaches the sea where it
may harm reefs and other marine life including near-shore fisheries.<P>
        Again, stream monitoring should detect unnatural increases in
sediment load, given sufficient record of normal fluctuation, and
inspection should reveal whether road construction, poor road
maintenance, poor logging, overgrazing, non-soil conserving agriculture
or building construction sites are the culprits causing watershed ill-
health. Traditional Quechua terraces (andenes) were excellent, but in
many places have been abandoned. Monitoring should also include scrutiny
for abnormally high levels of nutrients from fertiliser, pesticides, and
lead from automobiles. Since water is of such great importance to
society, regional land use control mechanisms to prevent water
production impairment are often relatively easy to have authorised and
implemented. Watershed protected areas have a key role to play, and many
more of these are needed.<P>

<B>Maintenance of culture and history</B><BR>
The final facet that I wish to treat as being an important element of
sustainable and quality living in the Andes (or other similar
mountainous regions) is that of maintaining the traditional cultural
richness and protecting the historic patrimony (e.g. pre-Columbian sites
and artifacts or traditional mountain livelihoods). While I indeed fully
recognise and support this need with passion, it is not an area of the
human state with which I as a mountain ecologist have as much expertise
as in the bio-physical sciences. If indeed the local communities of the
region are committed to slowing the rate of loss of their cultural
values and traditional life styles and livelihood systems, and to
protecting historical structures, artifacts and sites, then I feel the
same approach of looking for signs of unsustainability is appropriate.
This may be almost self-evident, since with historically valuable
physical material, conservators commonly do look for deterioration 
rotting timbers or missing roof tiles in buildings, air pollution damage
to statuary, etc.  and take restorative steps, but hopefully always
striving for authenticity.<P>
        For cultural value erosion, however, the recognition is more
complex, because change and transformation of many cultural values is a
normal and probably necessary part of an evolving society. This may be
especially true in mountain cultures worldwide where there is a general
outmigration of the skilled, the better-educated and the young, and
where new technologies are being urged or thrust upon traditional land
use systems by developers and donors from the lowlands or the world's
financial centres. I must leave it to others skilled in sociology,
anthropology, history or philosophy to identify the early warning signs
of cultural ill-health and to propose remedial actions that are
acceptable and desirable to the people involved. As an ecologist,
however, I do know that if the forest and wildlife are productive and
healthy; if all is well with the water; if the agriculture 'fits' and is
self-sustaining (not degrading the physical and human resources); if
there are protected areas providing adequate nature protection, outdoor
peace and recreation; if there is also a viable and economically
rewarding ecotourism; these can all help in concert to sustain many of
the cultural values and traditional livelihood systems. But there are
also pitfalls, and there are examples where inappropriate tourism
hastened the commercialisation or deterioration of a culture. Experts in
the behavioural and social sciences will be useful when working with
communities to define and achieve their local goals.<P>

<B>A few priority areas for sustainable regional development</B><BR>
This article has so far emphasised the great importance of research and
monitoring to detect signs of unsustainability as a strategy for a
harmonious mix of land or resource uses in a region. Let me at this
point conclude with a 'short list' of nine key environment elements for
special consideration, given that limited resources may restrict the
ability to tackle all elements of a regional mountainous landscape
through a planning process. All of these require or benefit from
designation in some kind of protected area. <P>

<B>1. Maintaining traditional cultures</B><BR>
One of the kinds of protected area recognised by IUCN is the <B>protected
cultural landscape</B>. This insufficiently used category provides support
for mountain people whose lifestyle and very cultural underpinnings are
being eroded, against their wishes, by exogenous forces of
'development'. Governments can recognise by official designation
mountain areas dedicated to maintaining the traditional land uses and
cultural manifestations of long-term residents (many generations) or
indigenous peoples. These are difficult areas to maintain effectively,
but many are serving well, for instance Cevennes National Park in
France's Massif Central.<P>

<B>2. Sacred sites</B><BR>
A second kind of area needing protection in mountain areas in particular
are those sites that have significant spiritual value. Every major
religion and most cultures have had sacred mountains or holy hills. One
thinks easily of well-known Olympus,   Zion, Ararat, Kailas, Fuji,
Tongariro, Tai Shan, Kilimanjaro, San Francisco Peaks, Mount Ranier. And
where there were no mountains, as in the Nile Valley, the constructed
pyramids were in the form of mountains as holy places for burial.
Bernbaum, in his fine book Sacred Mountains of the World (1990), has
documented many of these special sites of worship, fear or inspiration.
Pilgrimage is often a feature of these mountain sites. Perhaps the
pilgrimages of alpinists to difficult summits has also something of the
reverence and inspiration that makes these summits worthy of protection,
e.g. K-2, the Matterhorn or Mount McKinley. While many sites revered
internationally, nationally or locally have some de facto protection,
this needs to be reinforced by legal protection as heritage sites or
cultural natural monuments.<P>

<B>3. Habitats of rare and endangered species</B><BR>
The habitats of rare and endangered species for any region, and
especially endemics to the region, need protection from both ethical and
economic viewpoints. The conservation of the world's treasure house of
biological diversity is increasingly being recognised as an imperative,
even by politicians who have finally entered into a global Convention on
the Conservation of Biological Diversity. The high-elevation Polylepis
forests in the Central Andes need conservation not only because patches
of these forests themselves are disappearing rapidly, but because they
are habitat for many endemic, rare and endangered species such as the
giant conebill Oreomanes fraseri (O'Neill 1992). In Chile, the relict
species Cordillera cypress Austrocedrus chilensis needs emergency
protection. The threatened Alerce or Chilean false larch Fitzroya
cupressoides has been given some protection by having substantial stands
included in the Alerce Andino National Park in Chile (Weber 1990). The
Andean spectacled bear Tremarctos ornatus needs protection throughout
its range, which probably no longer includes Argentina and Southern
Bolivia. I agree with Dr E.O. Wilson who put it forcefully: <P>

"The worst thing that can happen  will happen in the 1980s  is not
energy depletion, economic collapse, limited nuclear war, or conquest by
a totalitarian government. As terrible as these catastrophes would be
for us, they can be repaired within a few generations. The one process
ongoing in the 1980s that will take millions of year to correct is the
loss of genetic and species diversity by the destruction of natural
habitats. This is the folly our descendants are least likely to forgive
us." (Wilson 1980.)<P>

Critical habitats for 'keystone' and 'flagship' species need to be
identified in a region, not neglecting plants or some of the less
attractive and less well-known small fauna species. Montane areas are
often the last bastions of wild nature in a sea of transformed
landscape, so the task of maintaining the natural heritage of a region
or a nation often falls mostly on the mountains. An adequate system of
protected areas of various kinds, might well blanket most mountain
areas. In the case of the continent-long Andean Cordillera, a corridor
of linked protected areas of various kinds, such as forest reserves,
national parks, wildlife sanctuaries and cultural protected landscapes,
would offer needed opportunities for migration and gene-flow of the
wonderful biodiversity of the Andes uplands. Such a linked network is
being developed in the Appenines of Italy with Abruzzo National Park as
the nucleus.<P>

<B>4. Riparian buffer zones</B><BR>
In my opinion, high on the list of the most important environments in
any landscape, whether mountainous or not, are the riparian buffer zones
of watercourses. As Hamilton and Pearce (1986) have pointed out,
maintenance of strips of natural vegetation along both sides of a stream
or river has many important benefits: reduction of streambank erosion,
trapping and immobilising sheetwash and rill sediments from up-slope
areas; trapping or filtering of nutrient and pesticide runoff from up-
slope; moderation of light and temperature levels in the water to the
benefit of fish and other aquatic life; provision of cover for wildlife
needing access to water; habitat corridors for terrestrial and avian
wildlife that permit easier migration and gene flow. Moreover such
buffer strips along the drainages give structure and pleasant pattern to
the mountain valley visual landscape. These riparian greenway corridors
are the natural skeleton on which the flesh of a region's intensive land
use is supported.<P>

<B>5. Summits</B><BR>
It is almost axiomatic that mountain summits, the most highly visible
parts of a regional landscape, need special consideration. Yet, they are
also favourite sites for some kinds of specialised infrastructure
developments, many of them with high levels of direct economic benefit.
Telecommunication devices, observatories, science complexes, ski-lift
terminals, and revolving restaurants are among the degrading debris on
many of our summits. Their associated construction and servicing needs
such as roads, add to the problem (though helicopters and automatic
equipment are reducing reliance on terrestrial access). While some of
these developments are needed for science, communication, and economic
uplift in a region, the identified sacred summits (using that word in a
broad sense of all that is elevating of the human spirit) need to be
protected, and alternative sites found for these other enterprises1.<P>

<B>6. Unstable slopes and avalanche hazard areas</B><BR>
Areas of soil or rock instability can and need to be identified and
given special attention so that risk and damaging use can be prevented.
Rock type, soil type, slope steepness, slope shape and rainfall
erosivity are all identifiable factors determining whether an area is
prone to surface erosion or mass movement (Megahan and King 1985). Such
areas should be mapped and zoned for special treatment, ranging from
total prohibition of use for areas of high landslide risk, to
performance standard controls for forestry, agriculture or buildings.
There is a public welfare issue at stake here, since the off-site
impacts of slope failure or severe surface erosion are visited on
neighbours, public infrastructure or public resources such as water
courses. Closely related to this of course is identification of snow
avalanche prone areas and the measures necessary to reduce risk of
damage by controlling land use. Mountain hazard mapping, and then zoning
high risk areas, are high on my list of priority actions.<P>

<B>7. Alpine grasslands and tundra</B><BR>
When inappropriately used, high elevation grasslands and mountain tundra
suffer rapid land degradation. Moreover they are slow to recover in
these climatically 'tough' environments. They therefore need a high
degree of conservation. The concern might also extend to adjacent or
related ecosystems such as shrublands and 'krummholz' which are also
very fragile. Domestic livestock (particularly sheep and goats),
tourists (and recreationists), and local populations living in these
high elevation environments are the principal damaging agents. In the
developed world's mountains, recreational motorised vehicles, hikers,
trailbikers and pack-animal safaris are of concern. Andean llama have
been introduced into the United States as replacements for pack horses
and mules where sustainable nature-based tourism is being practised.
This is because of the lower adverse impact in both feeding and
trampling compaction in fragile mountain grasslands. In the Andes the
pramo and puna environments suffer from unrestricted vehicle use,
pasturing of livestock and pedestrian travel. More areas of these two
ecosystems need to be brought under some kind of protection from these
impactors. Globally, in existing mountain national parks and other
reserves, controlling visitor numbers and their travel pathways is an
important management feature. The IUCN booklet <I>Guidelines for Mountain
Protected Areas </I>(Poore 1992) addresses these problems.<P>

<B>8. Mountain cloud forests</B><BR>
On the slopes (usually upper slopes) of many mountains, especially in
the tropics, occur important and unusual forest ecosystems known as
cloud forests. Each language has its own nomenclature for these
altitudinal belts: nebelwald, bosque de ceja de montaa, mossy forest,
fort nphliphile, selva de neblina, and many others. <P>
        Cloud forests occupy a relatively narrow altitudinal belt, but
the position of the belt varies widely. For large inland mountain
systems in the tropics (e.g. Andes, Rwenzoris) they may typically be
found between 2,000 and 3,500 m; whereas in coastal and island mountains
this zone may descend to 1,000 m (e.g. Hawai'i). On steep small islands
in very humid, equatorial conditions, a cloud forest may develop as low
as 500 m, or in rare cases 350 m (Gau in Fiji) (Hamilton et al. 1995).
The horizontal snow interception by conifer needles and twigs in some
Central European mountains (e.g. Krokno4e), where an "anemo-orgraphic
system" occurs at 1,0002,000 m, expressed as heavy "harvesting" of SO2
and other pollutants, and resulting in forest decline, possibly
indicates a type of winter cloud forest in this geographic location?
Cloud forests occur within a wide range of annual rainfall regimes
(50010,000 mm/year) and year-round moisture to very seasonal.<P>
        These interesting forests with their unusual physiognomy and
physiology capture 'occult' or horizontal precipitation by stripping
wind-driven cloud, and add it to the vertical precipitation supply of
the site. Evapo-transpiration rates are low in these forests, so that
there is a net addition of moisture to the ground because of the trees,
notwithstanding their use of soil water. Typical additions are between
5% and 20% of ordinary rainfall, but in some unusual cases of low
rainfall, but cloud contact, additions can be more than 100% of rainfall
(Bruijuzeel and Proctor 1995). If these forests are cut or cleared this
water capture is lost, and the water budget for the watershed is thereby
reduced. This has great significance for many communities in these low
rainfall areas.<P>
        Moreover, their biodiversity importance is very high (Hamilton
et al. 1995), particularly since they are often the last remnants of
wild nature on heavily-used and often abused mountains. Endemism is high
because these are specialised habitats that occur as restricted ranges
for many bird and other animal species (Long 1995). In Per for
instance, Leo (1995) has shown that a high percentage of all country-
endemic vertebrate species is found in the montane cloud forest. For the
three groups of vertebrates that she analysed, of the 272 endemics in
all of Per, 32% were found in cloud forest.<P>
        On the basis of the aforementioned values alone, not to mention
the other goods and services provided by these forests, they should be
given a high priority for conservation, and receive some kind of
protected area status. A summary of the state of knowledge of tropical
montane cloud forests has recently been produced by Hamilton et al.
(1995).<P>

<B>9. Zones of quiet</B><BR>
My ninth and final area of concern in this short list, is the impact of
noise  unwanted sound. Planning for any region where the underpinning
approach is to highlight nature and culture should have a concern with
noise pollution. The auditory assault of today's consumer society is not
only impairing human hearing and causing human stress, but is destroying
the song of the land whether it be the gurgle of a stream, a bird's song
or the tinkling of cowbells. While the noise of transporting machines is
unavoidable if people are to live in or visit a region, it need not be
everywhere, or the total level can be reduced in creative ways. A
concentration on ecotourism rather than mass tourism already puts a
region well on the way to keeping the problem manageable. <P>
        Positive steps need to be taken in these beautiful environments.
Zones of quiet could be identified, delineated and maintained where
pilgrims of peace and quiet might find sanctuary from loud radios,
vehicles and other jarring technological noise sources, including chain
saws. "Wilderness Areas" are now recognised as a special IUCN category
of protected area (Category Ib) along with Strict Nature Reserve, and
the international criteria include: "outstanding opportunities for
solitude, enjoyed once the area has been reached, by simple, quiet, non-
polluting and non-intrusive means of travel (i.e. non-motorised)". This
may be difficult to achieve in a long-inhabited and long-used area such
as much of the Andes, but it can be perhaps achieved in small, specific
areas to some degree. Even in areas of few or no inhabitants and no
roads in some parts of the world, the ubiquitous helicopter too
frequently shatters tranquillity and nature, as it brings tourists in to
view mountain areas of grandeur (e.g. Haleakala National Park and I have
just learned of problems at Machu Picchu, a site where contemplation
should be paramount). In a few areas aircraft overflights have been
banned, and there are height restrictions in others. It is an increasing
problem, and solutions are more difficult in view of the usefulness of
helicopters or off-road, all-terrain vehicles for rescue purposes in
mountain areas. Nonetheless aircraft noise must be addressed along with
other noise pollution sources. I have recently received from the
International Union of Associations of Alpinism its October 1994
resolution to all mountain governments with respect to control of
tourism aircraft flights in mountain regions and they are very tough
(UIAA 1994).<P>

<B>Coda</B><BR>
There are many other key environment elements of special consideration
(e.g. glaciers and caves) in developing a regional plan for maintaining
nature and culture, but space limitations preclude them. I have
emphasised the biophysical side and short-changed the cultural,
historical and metaphysical side. This is only because I have no
professional competence in these latter aspects of conservation. I have
also presented an overly-simplistic plea that because sustainability is
such a fuzzy goal, almost impossible of sure and measured achievement,
that we adopt a policy of activism in reducing unsustainability, which
is much easier to recognise. In both parts of this article I have
generalised to make the remarks applicable to planning for the
conservation and eco-development of mountainous areas at a    scale
within a national, provincial, state or prefectural boundary with
emphasis on the Andes.<P>

<B>The Sierra de Manantln Biosphere Reserve:  conservation and regional sustainable development</B><P>

ENRIQUE J. JARDEL, EDUARDO SANTANA C. and SERGIO GRAF<P>

<B>This presentation of the Sierra de Manantln considers the origin of the project, and gives a brief description of the environmental characteristics, social conditions and management problems of the area.  The conceptual approach to management and how we are working to attain the goals of a biosphere reserve are described.  Three main issues are discussed: the initial conditions that are determinant factors in conservation and development projects; the need to establish appropriate institutional mechanisms for land and resources management with a regional perspective beyond the protected area; and the need to develop a management approach with sufficient flexibility for implementing management programmes that assusre the conservation of biodiversity as well as the sustainable use of natural resources by local communit</B><P>

SIERRA DE MANANTLN Biosphere Reserve (SMBR) is located in the states of
Jalisco and Colima in West-Central Mxico (see map). With over 2,700
species of plants (40% endemic to Mxico) (Vzquez et al. 1995) and 560
species of vertebrates, including 26% of all mammal and 33% of all bird
species in Mxico (Jardel 1992), it is among the top protected areas in
North America for biodiversity.<P>
        The reserve covers 140,000 ha, ranging from 400 to 2,860 m above
sea level. Its topographic complexity, wide altitudinal gradient,
latitudinal location, proximity to the Pacific Ocean, geological
history, and also its long history of human occupation and natural
resource use, have interacted to create a very complex landscape.<P>
        The Sierra de Manantln forests play an important role in the
protection of watersheds that supply water to over 400,000 people. The
forests also harbour important timber and non-timber resources, which
support the livelihood of people in the area and represent an
alternative for the future development of local communities.<P>
        Agricultural fields and associated secondary vegetation in
hillsides and small valleys in the Sierra also contain important
components of biodiversity, comprising native landraces of cultivated
plants, their wild relatives and many other species of plants with local
uses for food, medicines, and fodder, among others (Benz 1988, Benz et
al. 1994).<P>
        The creation of the SMBR led from the discovery of a wild
relative of corn, the teocinte Zea diploperennis (Iltis et al. 1979),
that attracted international attention because of its potential use for
the genetic improvement of the second most important cereal in the
world. This perennial teocinte became a symbol of the need to conserve
wilderness areas for the genetic resources they contain. A small
protected area, called Las Joyas Research Station, was established by
the University of Guadalajara with support from the Jalisco state
government, to protect the habitat of teocinte. This led to the creation
of a local research centre that is part of the University of
Guadalajara, now known as the Manantln Institute of Ecology and
Conservation of Biodiversity. This institute has played a catalytic role
in the promotion of conservation actions in the Sierra de Manantln.<P>
        As knowledge of the mountain range increased, the one-species-
preservation approach developed into an ecosystem level approach where
the whole mountain range and its watersheds were considered as an
integral conservation unit. This in turn evolved a social component when
it became evident that the peasant communities owned the land and have
historic and cultural rights to use it. For the conservation project to
be successful the local communities had to benefit from the reserve, and
a national park or natural reserve model of strict protection was not
applicable.<P>
        The Manantln Institute generated the technical information
needed to propose the creation of a biosphere reserve and generated
local, national and international support for this task. The reserve was
created by the federal government in March 1987 and one year later was
incorporated in the MAB-UNESCO network of biosphere reserves.<P>
        However, there is another history running parallel to the
creation of the Sierra de Manantln Biosphere Reserve: the history of
the struggle between local indigenous communities and private logging
companies for the control of land and forest resources. Since the early
1900s foreign and national lumber companies began exploiting timber in
the forest of the Sierra de Manantln by basically stealing the forest
resources from the indigenous communities. This process was interrupted
by the Mexican Revolution and later by the Cristero War, but it resumed
in the 1940s. The lumber companies exploited the old growth forests with
great profits, leaving to the communities insignificant economic
benefits, impoverished forests, internal conflicts and corruption. The
lumber companies also interfered with the process of agrarian reform in
the region, creating additional conflicts of land tenure (Jardel et al.
1989, 1992).<P>
        In the late 1970s, a local peasant movement increased the
struggle against the powerful lumber companies. This resulted in their
suffering greater persecution and repression, but they were able to stop
logging in parts of the Sierra de Manantln. The University of
Guadalajara's proposal to create a biosphere reserve was seen by these
sectors of the local communities as an opportunity to establish
communication with the government agencies that had historically ignored
them and also to gain an ally in their struggle to defend forest
resources. Key groups in some communities supported the creation of the
biosphere reserve and defended the project against the reaction of
lumber companies and local power groups affected by the decree.<P>
        The Sierra de Manantln Biosphere Reserve project is now based
on a model that attempts to integrate ecological conservation with
regional sustainable development, based on active participation and
cooperation among stakeholders, including local populations,
governmental agencies and academic institutions (Jardel 1992, Graf et
al. 1995, Santana et al. 1989).<P>

<B>Environmental and social conditions</B><BR>
The Sierra de Manantln Biosphere Reserve is characterised by great
landscape heterogeneity. There are two main landscape units: a west-
central portion formed by igneous extrusive rock from the Tertiary
overlaid on Cretaceous intrusive rocks and the eastern portion formed by
calcareous rocks, also Cretaceous, with strong karst development and no
streams or rivers.
        The west-central portion can be divided into four landscape sub-
units:
<LI>      Highlands (2,3002,860 m) covered with fir-pine-oak forests in
cold-humid sites, pine forests in poor rocky soils and broadleaved
forest in small valleys.
 <LI>      Highly dissected mountain slopes covered by deciduous oak
forests at low altitudes (1,0001,500 m) and pine-oak forests at higher
altitudes (1,5002,800 m). Sites with frequent fire disturbance or
landslides are dominated by pine forest, and deep ravines and valleys
maintain subtropical humid broadleaf forests.
<LI>      Hills and low mountains (4001,000 m) with shallow rocky soils
maintain a vegetation complex that is dominated by deciduous oak
forests, tropical deciduous forests and tropical subdeciduous forests
depending on temperature and humidity conditions. A large part of this
landscape sub-unit is covered by agricultural fields, secondary
vegetation on fallow fields, pastures and forest fragments.
<LI>     Small inter-mountain valleys with deep soils that are dominated
by agricultural fields and secondary vegetation.<BR>
        The eastern portion is divided into two landscape sub-units:
<LI>    Plateau highlands dominated by humid oak forests, with
pine-fir-oak forest in cold sites, subtropical humid broadleaf forest in
ravines on the western slope, oak-pine forests in the drier areas, and
pine forests on poor soils or in areas with frequent disturbance by fire
or landslides.
<LI>    Sides of the plateau with steep slopes and shallow soils
that are covered with tropical deciduous forests and
agricultural fields and bamboo thickets.<P>
        Another landscape unit is the lower valley of the Ayuquila
river, an alluvial plain dominated by intensive agriculture, pastures
and relicts of riparian forests and subdeciduous tropical forests.<P>
        Forest management in these conditions is difficult, because of
the high environmental heterogeneity and the high species diversity of
the forests (Jardel et al. 1995). For example, the forests include 11
species of pines and 33 species of oaks, and more than 400 other species
of trees (Vzquez et al. 1995).<P>
        The creation of the reserve did not involve land expropriation.
It was basically a huge zoning regulation that established land use
restrictions. This is important considering that only 1% of the area is
government owned; 60% is communally owned land and 39% is private
property (Jardel et al. 1992). There are 26 agrarian communities and
some 80 private land owners. The population is dispersed in 79
localities within the reserve (Graf and Rosales 1995).<P>
        The reserve has 7,000 people living within its boundaries, but
we consider the population of the reserve to be some 33,000 people
living in agrarian communities that have rights over land within the
reserve area. Approximately 50% of the private owners have land tenure
conflicts with the local communities, and there are internal problems
within the communities themselves (Jardel et al. 1992).<P>
        Poverty is widespread, and within the state of Jalisco the
reserve population has very high rates of infant mortality, incidence of
infectious diseases, illiteracy and inadequate housing (Graf and Rosales
1995). These conditions translate into high emigration rates and social
strife.<P>
        However, there are differences in standards of living within
communities, as well as between communities and logging interests. The
development of cattle grazing in the forests has accentuated social
differences within the community. A few individuals have accumulated
wealth by increasing their cattle herds and this has allowed them to
fence communal areas and expand the land they hold, transforming forests
and agricultural plots to pasture (Gerritsen 1994, Graf and Rosales
1995, Graf 1992).<P>
        These conditions occur in the context of a prolonged economic
crisis that has strongly affected the agricultural and forestry sectors
in Mxico, and is aggravated by the policies of structural adjustment
implemented by the government under the pressure of international
financial institutions and the influence of neoliberal ideology (Calva
1994, Jardel 1995). Changes in public policies and economic conditions
generate pressure on natural resources, reinforce social differentiation
processes and conflicts, and impose budget changes that affect technical
assistance programmes, research, education and other activities that
support conservation efforts. This also produces a shift from
traditional crops to informal economic activities, such as illegal
logging or marijuana and poppy cultivation, generating additional
pressure on resources. These conditions impose severe constraints on
many conservation and development projects.<P>

<B>Management problems</B><BR>
The reserve has many problems that are common to most protected areas of
Mxico. These include:
<LI>     Transformation of forest cover to pastures and agricultural
plots.
<LI>   Erosion and low-productivity of hillside agricultural plots.
<LI>      Illegal logging.
<LI>      Excessive harvest of firewood.
<LI>       Poaching.
<LI>      Overgrazing and browsing in tropical forests.
<LI>      Forest fires.<P>
        Past logging practices have produced a forest characterised by
even-aged young stands (Jardel 1991), with a scarcity of high quality
timber for sawmilling. The forest products that can be generated have
low market prices, and there is therefore a need to invest in management
practices to restore the forest to an adequate condition for production.
The constraints of being situated within a biosphere reserve also impose
additional costs of managing for the maintenance of biodiversity, a cost
that traditional market mechanisms do not recognise.<P>
        The creation of the biosphere reserve without changes in the
tenure regime imposes a limitation of domain over land. Local
populations still own the land but cannot harvest its resources in core
zones and have conservation obligations but with no formal compensation.
This is especially critical in those communities where all their
forested lands fell within core zones. For example the ejido of Barranca
de la Naranjera is forced to protect the watershed in its land but
cannot even use the water for irrigation, because all the water in the
river is piped for use at a sugar refining mill outside of the reserve,
which maintains the regional economy. The ejido receive no compensation
for not using the forest and the water generated in its land.<P>
        Another problem is the pollution caused outside the reserve by a
sugar mill and small cities along the Ayuquila river, posing problems
for local communities that fish and use the water for irrigation
(Santana et al. 1993). This problem has now become a major conflict, as
the local communities perceive that the sugar mill is not doing its
share to diminish pollution and the government is not addressing the
problem.<P>
        The present rigid zoning regulations restrict implementation of
the management measures needed to restore sites affected by fires and
past logging activities. Also, they do not permit low-level traditional
extractive activities that are not damaging to the ecosystem, such as
collection of blackberries and mushrooms. Low-level hunting, a common
practice among peasants, is compatible with the conservation goals, and
yet cannot be implemented in the buffer zone. The prohibition of hunting
limits the possibility of managing this activity in a sustainable way
and promotes poaching. Even the conservation of species such as Zea
diploperennis involves active manipulation and disturbance that imitates
traditional shifting agricultural patterns (Benz et al. 1990). Legally
this cannot be done within the 'untouchable' core zone.<P>
        The lack of presence of government agencies before and after the
creation of the reserve forced the Manantln Institute of Ecology to
fill the existing institutional vacuum. This involved conducting general
environmental education programmes and publicising the creation of the
reserve. It also involved holding participatory workshops in key
communities in order to develop a 'map of the social needs' of the
community and initiate a small sustainable development programme. The
Institute played the role of watchdog, manager, consulting authority and
many others, but without having the legal authority, budget or human
resources at the scale needed. Government agencies implemented regional
programmes without consulting each other or the local communities,
resulting in many programmes working in opposite directions. Many
agencies did not even want to recognise the existence of the reserve.<P>
        In 1993 the federal government began to take up its management
responsibilities by establishing a directorship of the reserve,
supported by GEF funds from the World Bank. This initiated a
consultation process between institutions and states to redefine the
management of the reserve and to establish the priority conservation and
social development guidelines and the responsible agents. The director
works closely with the University of Guadalajara and the Secretary of
Social Development (SEDESOL) to attack poverty and production problems
in the poorest communities of the reserve, and to develop a
comprehensive conservation and development plan for the region.<P>
        However, there is still a need to create an appropriate
mechanism that incorporates the government agencies involved in the
management of the reserve, as well as a providing a way for the
participation of all the legitimate stakeholders of the area and
allowing for formal conflict resolution processes and participative
planning (Table 1).<P>

<B>Conceptual framework</B><BR>
The reserve is now being developed under the following general concepts:<BR>
        1.      Ecological conservation and social development are
integrated as one whole management strategy.<P>
        2.      Applied research and education will fill the gaps in
knowledge of the ecological dynamics of a complex and heterogeneous
system, as well as produce the necessary human resources to apply an
adaptive management programme.<P>
        3.      The reserve is an integral part of a regional
development programme, and land use is based on a zoning scheme where
core zones of strict protection are surrounded by buffer zones with
different intensities of resource use and these in turn by transition
zones towards the surrounding region. Managers must dedicate as much
time to working on development programmes outside the reserve as they do
to resource protection within the strictly protected areas.<P>
        4.      Community-based management is the basis for the
management activities, linked to the sustainable use of resources in
buffer zones in order to protect the core zone effectively.<P>
        5.      Since there are many stakeholders (Table 1) involved in
the management of land and natural resources in the reserve, the
administration will be achieved through a committee mechanism that
allows for coordination among governmental agencies, local authorities,
scientific and educational institutions and NGOs, and has an integral
consulting process with the local communities of the different
management units of the reserve. These mechanisms serve to enforce
commitments of government agencies and other actors in the region, and
to mediate when conflicts arise.<P>
        6.      The reserve is seen as an experimental model of
management of an area for conservation and sustainable use of the
natural resources, an experiment whose failures and successes might be
useful in other regions of Mxico with similar environmental and social
conditions.<P>
        All this is not just theory or a wish list. There are important,
albeit small, advances in the implementation of this model in the
region. Some examples are:<P>
        1.      The Manantln Institute manages the Las Joyas Research
Station, which has allowed the establishment of long-term research and
monitoring projects and provides training and educational facilities. At
first, the Station generated problems with the local population, but
once programmes of technical assistance for forest management and of
land tenure conflict resolution were in place, the Station was seen as a
benefit. It now employs people from neighbouring communities, permits
peasants to continue with controlled collection of blackberries in the
area, and provides logistical support during the fire fighting season.
It serves to demonstrate successful management programmes such as
restoration of subtropical humid montane forests and recovery of locally
threatened wildlife species. This experience can now be applied to the
overall reserve programme.<P>
        2.      In the ejido El Terrero, we have established a
participatory development programme, the objective of which is to
improve a mismanaged and badly planned communal lumber mill. Achieving
this has involved a long-term commitment to community processes. It
includes organisation and planning, renegotiating debts with
governmental loan programmes, obtaining funds to modernise the mill and
training people to manage it, and conducting research on forest dynamics
and silvicultural treatments to allow for sustainable harvest, so as to
produce the expected social and economic benefits in a way compatible
with forest conservation.<P>
        3.      In the ejido of Zenzontla, people depend on agriculture
and cattle raising and there is strong pressure to convert the remaining
dry tropical forest to pasture. Our programmes have concentrated on
increasing agricultural productivity and stability by implementing soil
conservation practices on hill-side plots and introducing organic
farming practices. This not only reduces pressure on the forests, but
also reduces costs, as well as dependence from outside agents.<P>
        4.      In the ejido Ayotitln, a region with a long history of
conflicts and disagreements over land tenure and the exploitation of
forest resources and mines by outsiders, we are beginning with a
programme of organic agriculture in cooperation with a local
organisation, the Indian People Union from the Sierra de Manantln. We
also mediated with governmental agencies to reorient public investments
in social services and productive activities in a way compatible with
conservation goals.<P>

<B>Perspectives</B><BR>
In order to implement a project like the Sierra de Manantln Biosphere
Reserve there needs to be a clear understanding of the initial
conditions that constitute the basic constraints for achieving
conservation and development goals, as well as the scales at which these
constraints operate. In this case the initial conditions at a local
level are:<P>
<LI>      Pressure over natural resources and unsustainable management.<BR>
<LI>      Extreme poverty and social differentiation processes.<BR>
<LI>       Social and land tenure conflicts.<BR>
<LI>       Absence of inter-institutional coordinating mechanisms.<BR>
        Those operating at national and international levels are:<BR>
<LI>      Economic crisis, being critical in the agricultural and forestry
sectors.<BR>
<LI>      Fundamental contradictions between economic and environmental
policies.<BR>
        Based on this analysis we can define two main strategies for
action:<BR>
<LI>      Improvement of natural resource management.<BR>
<LI>       Promoting changes in policy and institutional organisation.<P>
        Natural resource management includes protection, restoration and
production. Priority actions include developing a regional land use
plan, implementing more flexible approaches towards the management
programme, developing sustainable production systems for local
development and for conservation of biodiversity in forest and
agroecosystems, implement-ation of an interactive research-management
programme and enhancing management capabilities through education and
training.<P>
        Promoting public policy and institutional changes involves
creating an inter-institutional coordinating mechanism at the regional
level, establishing conflict resolution mechanisms that are recognised
by all stakeholders (Table 1), assuring a regional and local
participatory planning process, empowering local communities and
organisations to ensure democratic participation in decision-making and
negotiating processes, implementing environmental education programmes
at different levels and to different sectors of society, and reorienting
public policies and funding programmes to reflect real concern for
sustainable development and conservation.<P>

<B>Argentera Nature Park: scientific research, management and transfrontier cooperation</B><P>

PATRIZIA ROSSI<P>

<B>The Nature Park of Argentera (Italy) and National Park of Mercantour (France) together protect a total area of about 100,000 hectares corresponding to the Argentera-Mercantour Massif and its adjacent territories, in the heart of the Maritime Alps.<BR>

<DD>From the historical and cultural point of view, and from the scientific and naturalistic one, thee two parks represent the two complementary parts of what can be considered the first international park of the Alps.  They have been linked by a twining scheme since 1987 and are united by 33 km of common border.  Moreover, they actively collaborate in wildlife management and in some important scientific projects.  Their respective management agancies are completely independent from one another: one was created by the French Government, the other by the Italian Region of Piedmont.  Nevertheless, their cooperation is very close and successful.  From the conservation and protection point of view, both protected areas have quite strict regulations.  This paper describes the legal status of the parks, their conservation and cultural interest, management for tourism, and some of the research undertaken, including successful reintroduction programmes for birds and mammals.</B><P>

ARGENTERA PARK, even though it is a Regional Park, has a set of
regulations that in most respects is similar to that of the "central
zone" of French National Parks. Within the Argentera Park, one strict nature reserve and three
special nature reserves (see Map) were defined. One more reserve was
created to protect an important Mediterranean biotope: the Juniperus
phoenicea Reserve, outside the park territory but managed by the same
Board.<P>
        The Nature Park of Argentera covers nearly 26,000 hectares in
the Piedmontese province of Cuneo, including the upper Valle Gesso and a
small part of the Valletta di Aisone, in Valle Stura. It is the biggest
regional park in Piedmont and one of the largest in Italy. The park lies
on three communes which own most of its territory, as shown in Table 1.
There are no villages with permanent inhabitants within the park
borders, except the hamlet of S. Anna di Valdieri, with less than 100
people.<P>

<P>

        The protected territory is between the altitudes of 800 m and
3,297 m, corresponding to the southern peak (Cima Sud) of Argentera, the
mountain that gives its name to the Park. The Park headquarters is in
Valdieri, less than 20 km from Cuneo and not far from the TurinSavona
motorway and the international road to the Tenda tunnel.<P>

        The park includes the upper basin of the Gesso river, with its
characteristic fan shape formed by several deeply carved valleys on the
northern side of the Maritime Alps. The main massifs (from west to east)
are those of Monte Matto, Argentera and Gelas, all with several peaks of
more than 3,000 m of altitude. On the Gelas Massif there are many
Pyrenean type glaciers, the most southern ones in the Alps.<P>
        The Maritime Alps have the appearance and the features of high
mountains (3,300 m of altitude, wild and rugged rocky peaks, snow-fields
and glaciers) only some tens of kilometres from the sea: in clear and
windy days, from the top of Argentera it is possible to see the
Mediterranean and Corsica.<P>
        Microclimate variety, geological circumstances, glaciations and
lithotype richness are responsible for the existence in the Maritime
Alps of a flora which is unique in Europe. Plants with very different
biogeographic origins (Pyrnes, Provence, Corsica, Balkans,
mediterranean and arctic regions) are found together here, and there is
a high density of endemic species, with several remarkable
'paleoendemisms' such as Saxifraga florulenta. According to Pawlowski
(1970), the Maritime Alps are the prime area for endemism in the whole
alpine chain.<P>
        As far as fauna is concerned, its density is one of the highest
in the Alps, with no apparent overpopulation. For instance there are
more than 24 chamois per 100 hectares and six eagle pairs in 26,000 ha.
The Argentera ibex colony was one of the first in the Alps to be
recreated from the last colonies of the Gran Paradiso. Moreover, a
European project has reintroduced the bearded vulture on these
mountains, since 1993.<P>
        In this area, man has lived in harmony with nature since the
prehistoric age. Here, thanks to the active and concrete collaboration
with Mercantour National Park in France, nature really has no
boundaries. Argentera Park does not simply have a task of passive
conservation. It has actively participated and still participates in the
fight against damaging developments and sponsors environmental
restoration initiatives, sometimes with public and private partners.<P>
        Since its establishment, Argentera Park has been a member of the
Federation of Nature and National Parks of Europe, representing Italy in
the executive committee of this organisation. For this reason, the Park
has frequent and interesting contacts with other European protected
areas. It has already had some temporary staff exchanges at various
levels with English and Spanish parks, plus experience and information
exchange with Eastern European parks (Triglavski Narodni Park, Slovenia;
Kiskunsag National Park, Hungary; Krkonosski Narodni Park, Czech
Republic). Close collaboration ties link Argentera Park to La Sierra de
Las Nieves Regional Park (Andalusia, Spain). Together, they sponsor a
scientific research programme on ibex, with the coordination and
supervision of the University of Turin, for a comparative study of the
alpine species and the Spanish one. In October 1992, the twinning of
these two parks was celebrated on the occasion of an international
scientific congress of the Capra genus, in Ronda, where the Spanish park
has its headquarters. A link is currently being formed with Huascarn
National Park and World Heritage Site in Per.<P>

<B>Legal status</B><BR>
Argentera Nature Park was established by the Regional Law n. 65 of 30
May 1980, on the basis of a regional outline law and of the Regional
Plan for Parks. It is managed by a public Board controlled and financed
by the Assessorato alla Pianificazione Territoriale, the department for
territory planning of Piedmont Region. The Park has a board of
directors, its own budget and its own staff. The rules for the use of
the park were adopted with Regional Law n. 16 of 30 March 1987.<P>
        Picking of botanical specimens, camping, dog access, motor-
vehicle access and fishing are strictly regulated. Lighting fires,
leaving litter, collecting minerals, fossils and insects, working
quarries and peat-bogs, and hunting are all forbidden. Lumbering within
the park borders is allowed only on the basis of the Forest Management
Plan, but it is forbidden in areas of particular protection (Strict
Nature Reserves and Special Reserves). It is also forbidden to build new
roads and infrastructures that are not included in the area plan. This
plan allows only the interventions which are necessary to carrying out
the Park's activities and to the fulfilment of its aims.<P>

<B>Cultural and historical interest</B><BR>
The most ancient vestiges of the human colonisation of these territories
date back to the Bronze age (between 4,000 and 3,000 before present). In
the valleys of Valle des Merveilles and Fontanalbe (Commune of Tende,
Mercantour National Park) there are more than 100,000 incisions carved
on the rocks polished by glaciers during the Quaternary. Recently, the
Soprintendenza Archeologica (the archaeological board) of Piedmont and
the Civic Museum of Cuneo promoted an archaeological campaign which
revealed interesting discoveries in Argentera Nature Park, in the glen
of Vej del Bouc: graffiti, pottery and the remains of a Bronze age
village.<P>
        In those ancient times, shepherds and their flocks were already
moving along the sides of these mountains for which they had a sort of
religious respect. Even today, peaks and ridges are not a frontier:
pasture lands and shepherd huts ('gias') are spread all over the
territory.<P>
        The village buildings are characteristic: on the French side,
there are houses with 'colombages' roofs, while on the Italian
territory, there are still old villages, now mostly abandoned, with
thatched roofs. The Park is preparing a project which includes the
restoration of one of these villages to create an 'ecomuseum'.<P>
        The period of the Royal Hunting Reserve (18571946) left several
traces: various royal hunting residences in San Giacomo, Sant'Anna di
Valdieri, Terme di Valdieri and Valasco, hunting lodges and huts at high
altitudes and, most of all, many tracks that cover the whole territory
like a cobweb. During the period between the two world wars, many
military tracks were built using natural materials: an example worthy of
copying. For this reason, the area plan fixed a series of rules for the
respect of traditional building criteria, both for house restoration and
construction of new infrastructures.<P>

<B>Scientific research and nature management</B><BR>
Scientific research is particularly important for the activity of the
Park, both for the protection and enhancement of the environment and for
enjoyment, information and educational activities.<P>
        Scientific research is carried out directly by the Park staff
with the coordination and supervision of qualified experts (professional
researchers and university professors). <P>
        Collaboration with universities goes further, through the
realisation of stages and 'in field' activities (University of Milan 
Faculty of Natural Sciences) and through the assignment of graduate
theses on specific subjects (University of Turin  Institute of Geology
and Veterinaria; University of Bologna  Institute of Entomology;
University of Genoa; University of Pisa).<P>
        The Park has a 'foresteria' in Sant'Anna di Valdieri, with
guest-rooms especially prepared to give hospitality to researchers and
students who are doing their studies in the park.<P>
        Scientific research includes a series of essential operations
and routine activities, usually managed by Park personnel. The Park has
a computer data bank to catalogue all the observations recorded on
special forms by the rangers out in the Park. The data bank includes the
following sections:<P>
<LI>      amphibians and reptiles
<LI>       birds (with a special section on eagles)
<LI>      mammals (with a special section on ungulates)
<LI>      flora and vegetation. With regard to flora, the park has
prepared a herbarium including more than 600 species, with some 1,200
samples. <P>
        Other routine observations include checking of eagle nesting
(all eyries are listed and the breeding pairs have been monitored since
1984) and an annual census of ungulates.<P>
        A big (Italo-French) research project is under way studying
atmospheric pollution across the border and the damage to high mountain
conifers. The geographical extension of the project area covers the
western Alps with particular reference to the protected areas:
Argentera-Mercantour, Queyras-Val di Susa, Vanoise-Gran Paradiso. In the
Maritime Alps in particular there has been a yellowing of the leaves of
the species Pinus cembra and Larix decidua which, from the first
results, would seem to be caused by ozone pollution combined with
exposure to strong sunlight.<P>
        Among the most significant scientific initiatives of the park
are the creation of a botanical garden in Terme di Valdieri and the
reintroduction operations of ibex and bearded vulture in close
collaboration with the Mercantour National Park.<P>

<B>The alpine botanical garden "Valderia"</B><BR>
The extraordinary features of the park flora have already been
mentioned. These features explain why botanists have visited this area
for hundreds of years. In the 18th century, Allioni described for the
first time the species Viola valderia, an endemic violet that he found
on the gravel bank of the torrent in Terme di Valdieri. It is exactly
here, in the 'locus classicus', that the botanical garden with the name
of this endemic violet has been created. Works started in 1987. On 14
July 1990, in the presence of illustrious botanists from Italy and
France, the garden was inaugurated and opened to the public. Valderia
was designed on the basis of totally innovative criteria: it is neither
a 'classic' alpine garden with a collection of mountain flora specimens
coming from all over the world, nor a botanical garden with rigorous
geometric structure formed by squared flowerbeds and parallel paths.<P>
        It is rather the best possible reconstruction of all the
different habitats of the park, each one with its main indigenous
botanical species. Thus, it is divided into 'habitats', some of which
were already present while others have been artificially recreated: the
megaphorbiae association, the meadow, the crag and the detritus, the
grassland, the peat-bog, the stream, the shrubs, the herbaceous
understorey. Each one is interpreted with a wooden panel describing its
main features. In each habitat there are labelled specimens of the most
remarkable and typical species (more than 400).<P>

<B>Reintroduction projects: animals do not respect frontiers</B><BR>
Argentera and Mercantour parks inherited from the Royal Hunting Reserve
a long tradition of fauna management, even though the interventions were
justified by hunting interests rather than protectionist concerns. The
introduction on the French territory, in the 1950s, of a non-indigenous
species, the moufflon, must be considered in this context. Great
importance is given to the reintroduction of ibex on the Italian
territory in the 1920s with animals captured on the Gran Paradiso, thus
creating the first new colony of ibex in the Alps. Starting in the 1970s
some studies on migration (Pfeffer and Settimo 1973) proved the
existence of important migrations across national borders, with ibex and
moufflon moving from opposite sides. In summer, ibex migrate towards
French territories and, at the beginning of autumn, they come back to
Italy to their winter range. On the contrary, moufflon cross the
frontier to Italian territories in late summer but go back to France to
winter at lower altitude.<P>
        The importance of controlling these migrations and establishing
common and coordinated fauna management urged Argentera and Mercantour
parks' managers to strengthen their collaboration through the exchange
of data and common censuses and controls. The most significant
collaboration initiative is Operation Ibex, an important scientific
project that included the creation of two new ibex groups, one on the
Italian territory, the other on the French territory, in areas that had
not previously been colonised.<P>
        This operation was conducted in Italy in 19861987 with 46 ibex
releases. In France the operation took place for the first time in 1987,
with 13 ibex captured on the French territory; then in 1989 the
operation was repeated with 15 animals from Argentera Park, where the
capture was easier. Today the operation can be considered totally
successful.<P>
        The second operation concerns the bearded vulture Gypaetus
barbatus, the largest European bird, which disappeared from the Alps at
the beginning of this century. In 1975 IUCN promoted an international
programme of reintroduction in the Alps, which obtained the support of
WWF International. In 1987, on the basis of historical and ecological
data, the Argentera Regional Nature Park and the Mercantour National
Park proposed their common candidature as a reintroduction site. The
special International Commission gave its full approval and the
Argentera-Mercantour became one of four release sites in the Alps. Among
the reasons for the support of the experts was the presence of two large
protected areas, with 33 km of national boundary in common, the strong
will of the managers, and the good organisation of the Parks, based on
the work of 60 rangers and the extension of the protected territory
(100,000 hectares). In particular, this size factor is extremely
important, if you consider that a bearded vulture can cover hundreds of
kilometres in a short period of time.<P>
        After years of careful preparation (information campaign,
exhibition, brochure, film, drawing competition for school children; all
operations were conducted together by the two parks, with an Italian and
a French version) finally the first release took place in the Mercantour
in 1993 with three birds, followed by Argentera in 1994 with the release
of two bearded vultures. Placed in an artificial cave in the Valasco
Valley on June 14 1994 at the ages of 95 and 92 days, they were then
followed constantly by a team of experts until a month after their first
flight.<P>
        Considering that this is one of the most popular areas of the
parks it was necessary to take particular measures: road closure,
limitations for hikers, constant presence of rangers. This activity
generated enormous interest among the public and in the media (articles
in daily papers and on television). We have received reports of
sightings from many different sources: hunters, mountaineers, trippers
and shepherds. The releases will continue alternately in France and in
Italy for a period of ten years.<P>
        It is also of great importance to mention the appearance of
wolves on the French side of the Alps: six wolves were sighted together
in the winter 1993/94 in an area not far from the border. These probably
came from the Italian wolf population in the Appennines (the nearest
stable recorded group  150 km as the crow flies  is in the Liguro-
Piedmontese Apenine in Val Borbera on the border between the province of
Alessandria and Genoa). In summer 1995, there was the first sighting for
the Italian side of the Maritime Alps. An important joint project has
been prepared with the Mercantour National Park covering scientific
research and an information campaign. We have also been in contact with
the Abruzzo National Park in Italy because of their specific experience
in this field and with the Yellowstone National Park in North America,
where a wolf reintroduction took place recently.<P>
        The figures for the latest censuses of the larger animals
(chamois 4,500, ibex 600, eagles 7 pairs) show a general increase.<P>
        In accordance with the regional law n. 36/90 which legislates
fauna management, selective culls on boar and moufflon were carried out.
The former are supernumerary and have caused considerable damage to
agriculture. The latter are not an indigenous species and are in
competition with the chamois. The culling operation was carried out by
the rangers in collaboration with local hunters; this fact has helped to
create a positive collaboration between the Park and hunters. In
addition animals have been captured for repopulating other areas:
chamois (for the Monte Baldo area and the Province of Brescia) and ibex
(repopulation of the Forest of Tarvisio Nature Reserve, Eastern Alps,
and Parco Naturale Adamello-Brenta, Central Alps).<P>

<B>Effectiveness of protection</B><BR>
During the second World War the ungulate population fell by 80% but,
when hunting was forbidden again, it rapidly grew. Thus, the Hunting
Reserve did protect the animals in quite an effective way. However the
natural environment suffered many setbacks before the establishment of
the Park. For example, in the 1960s an international road tunnel, the
Ciriegia-Mercantour, involved the construction, of a short demonstration
tunnel (1 km), now closed. The most significant intervention was the
construction of two hydroelectric dams and one hydroelectric underground
power station in the 1970s. However, Argentera Park, after its
establishment in 1980, succeeded in preventing an even more damaging
development, the construction of new canals to collect water from nearby
glens. This project would have produced the same damage on all the park
territory that is now evident only in the Vallone delle Rovine. However,
since the early stages of its activities, the Park developed close
relations of collaboration with ENEL, the Italian hydroelectric board,
which started an exemplary programme of environmental restoration. This
programme includes removal of unnecessary material, consolidation and
grass covering of scarps. Moreover, at the power station, ENEL is
preparing an information centre on its plants which will include a
section dedicated to the Park and the delicate relations between
development and nature conservation. In the same valley the Park has
planned a picnic area by the semi-artificial Rovine Lake, with two aims;
that of restoring a ruined area and also creating an outlet (already
used as it is) for the massive influx of Sunday trippers.<P>
        Another positive aspect that should be stressed is the
successful degree of naturalisation of the artificial basins. This is
proved by the fact that one lake (La Piastra, about 1,000 m above sea
level) has become an important halting-place for migratory birds. During
recent years, interesting observations have been recorded of rare birds
and species coming from Northern regions: mallard (Anas platyrrhyncos),
teal (Anas crecca), tufted duck (Aythia fuligula), goldeneye (Bucephala
clangula), wigeon (Anas penelope), eider (Somateria mollissima), fulmar
Fulmarus glacialis (first Italian observation), grey heron (Ardea
cinerea), cormorants (Phalacrocorax carbo) and gulls (Laridae).<P>
        Another threat to the environmental integrity of Valle Gesso is
represented by limestone quarries that supply local cement-factories
with raw materials. In this case too, the Park obtained a positive
result with the creation of the Special Nature Reserve of Juniperus
phoenicea, for the protection of a remarkable mediterranean biotope of
calcareous crags. The Reserve succeeded in limiting the expansion of the
quarry, thus allowing the nesting of peregrine falcon (Falco
peregrinus).<P>
        Finally, the Park limited and controlled the expansion of
tourism, which started in the late 1960s, thanks to the "area plan", a
means of territorial and urban management. Moreover, it succeeded in
keeping the few, small ski-lifts outside the park borders.<P>
        A fundamental contribution comes from the Park rangers'
activity, the purpose of which is essentially educational but, when
needed, is also enforcement. Thanks to them, the behaviour of tourists
and visitors has definitely improved; actually, they are now more
respectful and more conscious of how to behave in the natural
environment.<P>

<B>Recreative, educational and sport interest</B><BR>
Alpinists started to explore the Maritime Alps during the drawing up of
the "Carta degli stati di S.M. di Sardegna", the map of the Savoia
kingdom (around 1830). However, at the time these mountains were
interesting for essentially geographical and military reasons. That is
why the first people to climb their summits were officers of the
Sardinian Army. Mountaineering had its golden age during the romantic
period, at the end of the 19th century.<P>
        English and German climbers were the most active at this time,
but the American Reverend Coolidge also deserves to be mentioned. He was
the first to climb the Canalone di Lourousa, an impressive slide of ice,
900 m from top to bottom and with a 45 degree gradient, and, after a
traverse on a ridge, he conquered the southern peak of the Argentera,
the highest summit in the Maritime Alps. Then came the French helped by
local guides. In 1930, Victor de Cessole succeeded in conquering the
Corno Stella, 'the noble cliff' and 'last peak of the old Europe thought
to be inaccessible', thanks to his guides Plent of S. Martin Vesubie and
Ghigo of S. Anna di Valdieri.<P>
        Nowadays, mountaineering is very much practised in this area;
there are climbing faces and routes for all skills of alpinists and new
routes continue to be opened. Hiking too is very popular, thanks to the
extraordinary network of mountain paths, with nine mountain huts and six
bivouacs of the Italian Alpine Club (CAI).<P>
        The territory lends itself also to other sporting activities:
canoeing, mountain-bike, pony-trekking and alpine skiing. The Park can
control sporting activities and avoid excessive disturbance by limiting
access to its territory and the regulation of timing of activities. As
far as general enjoyment is concerned, the Park has carried out
significant educational activities for many years now, in collaboration
with all kind of schools, from primary to university level. Each year,
detailed programmes are put forward for instructional activities, from
guided visits to various kinds of projects on specific subjects. For its
visitors, the Park has an agreement with local hotels and its own
guesthouse, the Casa del Parco in Trinit di Entracque, with 35 beds,
several rooms and teaching equipment to be used during 'green-week'
stays and courses for students from primary to high school. For
university students conducting specific studies or preparing their
graduation theses, there is the already mentioned "Foresteria" in
Sant'Anna di Valdieri.<P>
        Moreover, in Entracque, there is a visitor centre, with a
permanent exhibition to introduce the Park to the public, and an
information office, where brochures and other publications are
available, some free and some for sale. The visitor centre also offers
an instruction room for lessons, seminars and audiovisual activities.
Another visitor centre, open in summer, has been set up at Terme di
Valdieri near the Botanical Garden. It has various facilities and an
exhibition on the Park's flora.<P>
        The Park is fully equipped to produce its own video cassettes
and audiovisual material for didactic and educational purposes. Finally,
in the Park building in Valdieri, there are all the administration
offices, plus a small library, video and photo archives, the already
mentioned herbarium, a laboratory for the preparation of naturalistic
specimens to be used in visitor centres and in teaching activities, and
a carpentry-workshop for preparing signs, information boards and wooden
equipment for picnic areas. For the moment, two such areas have already
been equipped (Ciriegia and La Piastra), and two new ones are under way
(Rovine and Terme). The aim of this latter kind of intervention is
essentially the concentration of the presence of tourists in less
vulnerable areas, where enjoyment can be more easily controlled.<P>
        Finally, Argentera and Mercantour Parks have confirmed their
affinity through a common information policy. In particular, they have
produced a bilingual brochure of presentation of the two parks on the
occasion of their twinning, bilingual brochures on ibex and bearded
vulture, an exhibition on this rare bird, a common poster on Argentera
and Mercantour, a guide-book for hiking and, recently, a brochure on
transfrontier trails for pony-trekking.<P>
        Their historical ties and their present active cooperation
convinced the Argentera and Mercantour managers to coordinate their
respective efforts, with the ambition of obtaining the European Diploma
for each of them.<P>
        The initiative was successful: for the first time two
neighbouring Parks were awarded with the Diploma at the same time (16
October 1993). The Diploma has strengthened the cooperation: after the
ibex and the bearded vulture projects, the wolf project is under way.
Besides this, there is the operation "Mountains without frontiers": 20
border itineraries from La Maddalena pass to the Mediterranean in the
Franco-Italian protected area of the Maritime Alps. It is a boxed set
containing a book (in French and Italian) and 1:50,000 maps, with all
the practical and tourist information on the villages and the natural
environment along the routes: frontiers should not exist for animals or
for humans!<P>

<B>Protected area increase</B><BR>
Recently it was announed that Argentera Park would change its name and
become bigger still: in April 1995 the protected area was enlarged to
include the neighbouring "Bosco e Laghi di Palanfr" Nature Reserve
which was run independently (1050 hectares: see map). The management of
the two protected areas has been concentrated into one body which will
be called the Maritime Alps Nature Park (= Parco Naturale Alpi
Marittime). The staff have been amalgamated too, and go from being 27 to
36 in number.<P>
        Over 1,200 hectares of new territory has been included with the
addition of part of the Sabbione valley, an unspoilt and scenic valley
bordering on the French Mercantour National Park. From a naturalist's
point of view this territory is extremely important, because it is
between the crystalline massif of the Argentera mountains and its
surrounding sedimentary base. The flora is, therefore, very varied and
we can add the species that are typically endemic to limestone soils to
the Park's list, amongst these the prestigious Primula allionii. As far
as the fauna is concerned we should have better conservation of the
chamois population, because a stretch of land where hunting was
permitted has been eliminated. Fortunately the local huntsmen did not
protest, because they realise the importance of the park in acting as a
game breeding ground for the surrounding area. In this way we have given
an efficient and concrete response to one of the suggestions made along
with the European diploma which looked towards an improvement in the
boundaries for a better management of the biotopes. The new enlarged
regional protected area is now one of the biggest in Italy, coming close
to 30,000 hectares, and could be considered the nucleus of the possible
Maritime Alps National Park, which the national framework law refers to
and which many hope to see instituted.<P>

<B>The Australian Alps National Parks and protected area management</B><P>

GRAEME WORBYS<P>

<B>The Australian Alps comprise the highest parts of the Great Dividing Range and associated mountains in the south-east of the Australian continent.  Over the last 70 years historical exploitation and inappropriate land use within the Allps have mostly been replaced with conservation management practices.  This has included the establishment of contiguous protected areas across three Australian states reinforced by a transboundary cooperative management agreement between three State Governments and the Australian Federal Government.
<DD>This paper briefly describes the land use struggles and key developments leading to the establishment of the Australian Alps National Parks, one of the great systems of protected areas of the Australian continent.  It provides an account of how park management principles and practices evolved strongly in the Alps, often in response to hard experience gained from the conservation versus historical and contemporary land use debates at hand.  The paper also discusses how park management expertise gained during the evolution of the Alps parks has had significant benefits to protected area management practice throughout Australia and internationally.</B><P>

THE AREAS generally known as the Australian Alps (the Alps) comprise the
highest parts of the Great Dividing Range and associated mountains in
the
south-east of the Australian continent (Costin 1989). Of the 25,000 km2
covered by the Alps (Costin 1989), about 15,300 km2 (62%) is permanently
conserved in its essentially natural character within protected areas
(Worboys et al. 1993). <P>
        The Alps (see map) represent only about 0.3% of the Australian
land mass and include all of the mainland snow country (approximately
5,200 km2 above the average snowline of 1,370 m) as well as Australia's
highest mountain, Mt Kosciusko (2,228 m). They enclose slopes and
valleys running both inland and towards the coast down to approximately
200 m above sea level (Costin 1989). Water originating in the Alps is of
national and regional importance, being used to sustain agriculture in
one of the most productive areas of Australia (Lawrence 1993), the
Murray-Darling basin river system. The river system, the largest in the
Australian continent, receives about one-quarter of its average yield
from the Alps even though the Alps only occupy about 1% of its total
area (Costin 1967). By Australian standards, the variability of the
runoff from the Australian Alps is low. Water from the Alps is also used
for domestic consumption and hydro-electric power generation.<P>
        The Alps are rich in natural and cultural heritage. They contain
species and features not found anywhere else in the world, such as the
mountain pygmy possum Burramys parvus and the corroboree frog
Pseudophryne corroboree, both of which are endangered species; they are
an area isolated from other mountain chains of the Southern Hemisphere
and they are of considerable antiquity. An environment type that
contrasts dramatically with the rest of the continent, the Alps are an
outstanding area recognised for their national and international
significance. The Alps are listed on the Register of the National Estate
and Kosciusko National Park is a World Biosphere Reserve.<P>

<B>The development of protected area principles and practices</B><BR>
The heritage and inspirational values of the Alps provided a unifying
element for many individuals and visionaries associated with the areas
(Mulvaney 1992). The ambience and quality of the landscapes, the moods
of the weather  these are some of the factors that inspired individuals
to work with great energy and commitment towards a common goal of
conservation for the Alps. The role of key individuals whose
conservation work was often undertaken against tremendous odds and
opposed by land use cultures practised for several generations is
discussed below.<P>

<B>The Alps before 1944</B><BR>
Richard Helms (Helms 1893) documented the negative impacts of grazing on
the New South Wales (NSW) section of the Alps but little occurred to
rectify the situation until the 1930s, when severe disquiet about the
impacts of traditional land use practices on mountain catchments in the
Alps began to gain momentum.<P>
        The severe degradation in the catchment areas of the NSW Alps
was investigated by Forester Baldur Byles in 19311932. Byles focused on
the protection of the Murray Catchment above the then proposed Hume Weir
which was completed in 1936. His report called for the rehabilitation of
the eroding areas and for rangers to control grazing (Byles 1932).
Byles' conservation recommendations, however, were not based purely on
utilitarian values. He also deeply appreciated the intrinsic natural
values of the NSW section of the Alps and became one of its staunchest
conservation advocates (Gare pers. comm.).<P>
        During this period, Victoria suffered devastating dust storms
and major wildfires in January 1939. In the patchily burnt Victorian
Alps, the prolific regeneration of grasses and shrubs attracted cattle
grazing, exacerbating the post-fire soil erosion in Victoria's high
country. Concern was raised, and in 1940 Victoria passed the Soil
Conservation Act, under which Victoria's Soil Conservation Board was
established to address the problem of soil erosion in the state
(Gillbank 1992).<P>
        This was an important step because it led to the formal
introduction of scientists into the management of the Victorian Alps.
The Soil Conservation Board sought help from the Professor of Botany at
Melbourne University, who arranged for Stella Grace Maisie Fawcett MSc
to undertake an extensive ecological survey of the Hume Catchment
(Gillbank 1992). Maisie Fawcett also turned her attention to the Bogong
High Plains and initiated long-term exclusion plots and surveys of the
effects of grazing on the high mountain catchments of Victoria. Her
early reports clearly identified the soil erosion problems and the
adverse affects of burning and grazing. Her role was the beginning of
the powerful part scientists were to play in the future land use and
management of the Alps. <P>
        During the 1930s and early 1940s the nucleus for a conservation
area in the Snowy-Indi area (the Alps in the NSW/Victorian border area)
was proposed by Myles Dunphy (Mosley 1992). This was the first
substantive recognition of the need to conserve the intrinsic heritage
values of the Alps. Although The Snowy Mountains National Chase,
together with some small reserves over the limestone areas in the NSW
section of the Alps, had been established earlier, these were largely
ineffectual in protecting the Alps in NSW (Stanley n.d.).<P>
        In 1938, the NSW Soil Conservation Service was formed (Mosley
1992) to conserve and protect the catchments of the Alps and other areas
of NSW. This convergence of concern over the catchments was also
promulgated by the potential of the catchments to sustain hydro-electric
developments. Sir William McKell (Premier of NSW) and Mr Sam Clayton
(the new Commissioner of Soil Conservation) were the principal players
involved in the concept of the improved conservation of the NSW section
of the Alps during the early 1940s (Worboys 1994). Clayton was a driving
force behind the need to conserve the NSW Alps as a catchment area
(Costin pers. comm.).<P>

<B>The 1944 Kosciusko State Park Act, and the Alps during the 1950s and
1960s</B><BR>
The work of Maisie Fawcett continued in Victoria and resulted in
significant reductions in stocking rates in the high country of Victoria
during the 1950s and 1960s. Alec Costin, then a young Sydney University
graduate, also became involved in the conservation of the Alps through
summer work with Maisie Fawcett. Influenced by the botanist Dr Jim
Willis (Costin pers. comm.), Costin, through his work with the Soil
Conservation Authority of Victoria, played an important role in
introducing soil conservation principles throughout Victoria, especially
in the Victorian Alps. Later, as a Commonwealth Scientific and
Industrial Research Organisation scientist, Costin played a critical
role in achieving a science-based approach to the conservation of the
Alps.<P>
        On 19 April 1944 following Premier McKell's history-making
directive, the Kosciusko State Park Act was passed setting aside the
528,646 hectare Kosciusko State Park and establishing the Kosciusko
State Park Trust (the Trust). Of this area, 10% was to be established as
a primitive area and the State Park was to be managed to protect the
catchments, to provide for recreation and to provide for controlled
grazing (Worboys et al. 1991). It was the first very large protected
area established in Australia (Mosley 1992).<P>
        Myles Dunphy played a prominent role in attempting to establish
conservation parameters, although many of his fundamental conservation
management principles were not able to be followed at that time (Mosley
1992). Forester Byles was appointed as one of the original Park
trustees, and increasingly became a prime advocate for improved
management and conservation, often working quietly behind the scenes to
influence people (Gare pers. comm.).<P>
        This most important pioneering legislation set the scene for the
development of basic conservation management principles and practices.
Its potential was not fully realised for a number of years, however, and
not until significant influence was brought to bear by outsiders. This
influence came from the recently formed Snowy Mountains Hydro Electric
Authority (1949) which was concerned about the protection of the
catchments for water yield purposes and as a consequence exerted
pressure for the removal of grazing. Scientists working with the NSW
Soil Conservation Service had similar catchment protection objectives
and also exerted pressure. Grazing in many parts of the NSW Alps still
continued, although stocking rates were reduced. Importantly, however,
this pressure influenced the NSW Government not to renew any snow leases
above 4,500 feet in altitude after 1958.<P>
        The Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Authority (SMHEA) also had
many development objectives for the mountains of NSW and proposed a
scheme to dam and utilise the very highest headwaters of the Alps near
Mount Kosciusko. This included the construction of dams and aqueducts.<P>
        These threats from the SMHEA and threats from proposed ski
facilities in the summit area of Kosciusko brought a concerted response
from conservationists. The conservation battle to protect the very
highest peaks from modification became very intense before the
conservation protection of the area was achieved. Significant influence
was achieved during this debate by soil conservation scientist Dr Alec
Costin, prominent scientist Dr W.R. Browne, as well as by a concerted
lobby from the Australian Academy of Science (Worboys et al. 1995). <P>
        A change in the balance of power on the Kosciusko State Park
(KSP) Trust at about this time helped to realise a more proactive
conservation-based approach for the State Park. This led to a more
determined approach to implement the NSW State Government's new grazing
ban. It also appointed a professional manager in 1959 (Mr Neville Gare)
and achieved a strict conservation approach for the Summit Area of
Kosciusko through the proclamation of a Primitive Area in 1963 as
permitted by the Kosciusko State Park Act (Mosley 1992). <P>
        Whilst it was still beset by many problems, Kosciusko State Park
under the leadership of the Trust and Superintendent Gare began to
emerge as a pioneer in Australian protected area management. During the
period 19591965 Gare was influenced by his mentors, Byles (Mosley 1992)
and Costin, as well as his contacts with the USA and New Zealand
National Park systems. Attendance by the newly appointed Trust Deputy
Chairman at the Second World Conference on National Parks in Seattle,
USA, in 1962 brought support to Gare for concepts such as uniformed
rangers, information centres, park signs and interpretative programmes. <P>
        The first Master Plan for the State Park was completed in 1966
and many basic conservation principles including a zoning scheme for the
park were manifest in that document. International Park management
principles and practices and conservation philosophies were actively
sought by Gare and the Trust and, where appropriate, were introduced at
Kosciusko. A visiting Fulbright scholar, Mr Grenwill Lloyd, was an
advocate of a zoning scheme concept at Kosciusko, and may have
influenced its development (Costin pers. comm.). The resource management
committee of the Trust also set new standards for the management of
Kosciusko State Park especially through the Master Plan (Gare pers.
comm.).<P>
        A change in Government in 1965 brought a new force to the Trust.
As the Minister for Lands and Chairman of the Trust, the Hon. Mr Tom
Lewis was an energetic and visionary politician who strove for the
continued and improved conservation management of Kosciusko State Park
(Gare pers. comm.).<P>
        The Kosciusko State Park management model was significantly
influenced by Minister Lewis and in turn, its success influenced him.
His 1967 NSW legislation (National Parks and Wildlife Act) achieved his
long-held vision to establish a state- wide professional National Parks
organisation for NSW to administer the state's multiple national parks
and nature reserves (Gare pers. comm.). Soon after the introduction of
the new legislation in October 1967, the newly formed National Parks and
Wildlife Service (NPWS) took over the management of Kosciusko National
Park. The Trust was dissolved and the Kosciusko National Park Advisory
Committee was formed. The Alps and the Kosciusko State Park management
model had played a key role in the creation of the NSW NPWS.<P>
        Conservationists in Victoria pursued the concept of a Victorian
Alpine National Park in 1949, in 1969 and again in 1975 but were
unsuccessful (Johnson 1974). A continued and sustained lobby for the
establishment of a Victorian Alpine National Park however, became a
powerful political force within Victoria.<P>

<B>The Alps during the 1970s and 1980s</B><BR>
The Alps protected areas increased in size in the early 1970s, with the
addition in 1974 of the Byadbo lands to the Kosciusko National Park, and
the creation of the Gudgenby Nature Reserve in the Australian Capital
Territory (ACT) in 1979.<P>
        In Victoria, there was considerable agitation for a Victorian
Alpine National Park and the newly formed Land Conservation Council
recommended major new protected areas in the Victorian Alps (Bogong
National Park, 79,000 ha; Wonnangatta-Moroka National Park, 104,000 ha;
Cobberas-Tingaringy National Park, 17,000 ha; the Avon Wilderness,
29,500 ha) (Land Conservation Council 1979). After many years of
agitation, this was an important step forward but it fell short of
achieving the grand vision for a large Victorian Alps protected area
along the length of the Great Dividing Range connecting with Kosciusko
National Park.<P>
        The 1967 establishment of the NSW NPWS and subsequent expansion
of the state's national park system meant that experienced national park
professionals were needed to manage these new areas. Many Kosciusko-
trained personnel, being among the most experienced protected area
managers in the state, were transferred to manage these reserves as well
as to other professional posts within the organisation. Kosciusko
National Park became an active training park for many of the new ranger
staff appointed to the NPWS.<P>
        This period also witnessed the indirect influence of the
Australian Alps management both nationally and internationally.
Superintendent Gare was seconded to assist the Papua New Guinea
Government to establish its national parks and reserve system. Later, he
returned to Australia to help establish the Australian National Parks
and Wildlife Service (ANPWS) now the Australian Nature Conservation
Agency (ANCA).<P>
        During the late 1970s and early 1980s, the NSW national park and
reserve system was expanded further and Kosciusko National Park again
trained and supplied experienced management professionals to the new
areas of responsibility. Other Kosciusko staff were promoted to heritage
conservation positions in other organisations such as the Sydney Water
Board, NSW State Premier's Department and ANCA.<P>
        During the early 1980s an important development in the training
and establishment of minimum standards for rangers occurred. Personnel
from Kosciusko National Park and the Riverina College of Advanced
Education together initiated the concept of a formal qualification
(Associate Diploma) for rangers through correspondence course work and
regular live-in training camps. This pioneering qualification for
rangers has subsequently become adopted by many agencies throughout
Australia as the training standard for Australia's rangers.<P>
        In the ACT the establishment of Namadgi National Park in 1984
together with an addition in 1991 extended the areas protected in the
Alps. The unique leasehold land tenure system operating since the
inception of the ACT greatly assisted the establishment of Namadgi
National Park, because it provided strong controls over the use of the
land, especially subdivision and clearing.<P>
        In the Cotter Valley, the need to protect a water supply for the
National Capital led to strict controls over public access early this
century. This same demand for potable water will continue to provide a
basis for the security of the Namadgi (Hayes pers. comm.).<P>
        Growth in the NSW ski industry created new demands for expansion
of ski resorts at Kosciusko and a far more sophisticated approach to the
management of the ski fields by the NPWS. Pressure from large numbers of
vehicle-based summer visitors on the Summit area of Kosciusko created
major impacts on the sensitive alpine vegetation and a management
strategy to protect the Summit area was developed in 1979 (Worboys et
al. 1995).<P>
        In 1982 following an extensive public consultation period, the
new Kosciusko National Park Plan of Management was approved and achieved
many conservation gains including the exclusion of vehicles from the
Summit area, the prohibition of grazing, and the transfer of fire
management responsibilities from an external organisation to the NPWS.<P>
        The Alps protected areas set a high standard within Australia
for the development of professional national park plans of management.
The 1982 Plan of Management for Kosciusko National Park, the 1986 Plan
of Management for Namadgi, and plans for the Victorian Alpine National
Parks were all developed to a high professional standard.<P>
        In the late 1980s, the most significant conservation achievement
for the Alps since 1944 occurred. On 2 December 1989, after a 49 year
conservation battle, the Victorian Alpine National Park was proclaimed.
This achievement followed a period of intense political manoeuvring,
compromising, and political campaigning. The mountain cattlemen in
particular held major demonstrations in Melbourne and captured the
political debate for a considerable period. Even on proclamation day at
Snowy Plain in the heart of the Victorian Alpine National Park the
mountain cattlemen staged a horseback demonstration. <P>
        The need for cooperative planning, fire management and
conservation work in the border areas of the Alps National Parks formed
the catalyst for the development of the Australian Alps Memorandum of
Understanding (MOU) signed in July 1986 by the State and Federal
Ministers responsible for the Alps and their management. The MOU, a non
legally-binding cooperative agreement, established a number of
conservation objectives to be implemented through mutually agreed and
planned cooperative work programmes across state borders. An enhanced
conservation outcome based on ecosystem management for the Alps was now
possible.<P>

<B>The Alps in the 1990s</B><BR>
During the 1990s, the implementation of the Alps MOU was further refined
and strengthened. This included the development of a three-year
strategic planning cycle, a formal budget with contributions from State
and Federal Governments and the appointment of a permanent coordinator
to manage the annual work programmes and the three-year strategic plan.
The success of the Alps MOU has provided a model for the establishment
of additional transboundary cooperative programmes within Australia.
Recent programmes such as at Jervis Bay, between the NSW NPWS and ANCA,
and a proposal for a transboundary coastal wilderness management
agreement between the NSW NPWS and Victorian Department of Conservation
and Natural Resources, are based on this model. <P>
        The Australian Alps MOU has also received considerable interest
internationally, and IUCN (Thorsell 1990) has recognised the Australian
Alps National Parks as a leader in the field of transboundary
cooperative protected area management. As a result of this interest, the
Australian Alps were selected as the venue for the first transboundary
mountain protected area travelling workshop. The workshop was convened
by IUCN, the Australian Alps Liaison Committee and ANCA and was
conducted during November 1995. It brought pairs of transboundary
mountain protected area managers from all over the world to witness
cooperative management in action.<P>

<B>Conclusion</B><BR>
Land use within the Australian Alps over 70 years witnessed a
transformation from exploitative to conservation-based land use
practices. This was achieved through the sustained actions of
individuals and organisations with a strong commitment to the
conservation and protection of the catchment and heritage values of the
Alps. Government legislation established soil conservation authorities
in two states, the Kosciusko State Park and the NSW National Parks and
Wildlife Service. Management of the protected areas established in the
Alps evolved to deal with the conservation and protection issues at hand
and management professionals gained considerable experience and skills
in the process. The Australian Alps National Parks played a central role
in the establishment of the protected areas concept and their management
in Australia well beyond the Alps region. Conservation principles and
practices were established for the Alps parks; minimum acceptable
standards of management were determined and pioneering and innovative
management approaches were developed particularly in the area of
protected area management planning.<P>
        The establishment of the Australian Alps National Parks and the
Australian Alps MOU represents one of the outstanding success stories
for conservation management in Australia. Focusing on ecological issues,
species conservation and catchment protection in a manner that largely
transcends political imperatives and administrative boundaries, the MOU
achieved a common vision and conservation philosophy for the Alps. This
initiative continues to be a model for transboundary management both
within Australia and internationally.<P>

<B>Sacred mountains: implications for protected area management</B><P>

EDWIN BERNBAUM<P>

<B>Sacred mountains highlight the key role that culture plays in
influencing how people view and treat the environment. For long-term
success policies of conservation and sustainable use need to take such
cultural factors into account, enlisting the aid of traditional beliefs
and practices. Otherwise they will fail to gain the support of
indigenous communities and other interested parties. In addition, sacred
mountains reveal what in nature different societies revere and feel
motivated to protect.<P>
        People experience the sacred nature of mountains through the
views they have of them, such as the mountain as centre of the universe
or place of renewal. This paper examines some of the most important and
widely distributed of these views or themes and draws out their
implications for formulating policies and measures for the conservation
of mountain cultures and environments. The conclusion suggests that we
broaden notions of sustainability to spiritual and cultural, as well as
economic and ecological, aspects of the environment. <P></B>

SACRED MOUNTAINS highlight the key role that culture plays in
influencing how people view and treat the environment. As the highest
and most 
impressive features of the landscape, mountains tend to reflect the
highest and most central values and beliefs of different societies 
values and beliefs that underlie the ways people see the world and their
place in it. These values and beliefs determine to a great extent which
natural resources people seek to exploit and which features of the land
they strive to preserve. For any assurance of long-term success,
policies directed toward environmental preservation and sustainable use
need to take such cultural factors into account; otherwise they will not
win the support of communities and individuals who most directly impact
the areas under consideration.<P>
        In general, whatever people perceive as sacred possesses for
them ultimate reality and value. As a manifestation of ultimate reality,
however that may be conceived, it acquires a special status that puts it
beyond the reach of mundane manipulation. This attitude is expressed
with particular force in Maori ideas of tapu or sacred mountains. They
are places forbidden to ordinary people, off-limits to profane uses. In
addition, the sacred is regarded as having a supreme value that makes it
worth protecting at all costs  a value which, in fact, transcends all
cost. If cultivated and taken seriously, such attitudes can function as
powerful forces helping to preserve the integrity of natural
environments.<P> 
        Of all the different kinds of natural sacred sites, mountains
are the ones that form the most diverse and complete environments and
ecosystems. They include shrub lands, forests, meadows, deserts,
tundras, glaciers, rivers, lakes. Within these diverse environments,
mountains hold a great diversity of flora and fauna, ranging from
tropical to arctic. They function, in fact, as microcosms of the
environment as a whole. Sacred mountains can, therefore, give us some of
the best pictures of what in nature people of different cultures revere
and feel deeply motivated to protect.<P> 
        Although in many traditions the sacred itself is considered
ultimately indefinable, it is not amorphous. People experience the
sacred nature of mountains, in particular, through the views they have
of them, such as the mountain as centre of the universe or source of
life. The various expressions of these views or themes differentiate the
experience of the sacred and provide articulation for doing research and
formulating policy for different cultures and mountain regions.<P>
        To enlist local support for research and policy implementation,
it is important to develop some empathetic understanding of how this
works. Each view or theme brings together various ideas and images to
evoke the experience of a deeper reality hidden in a mountain perceived
as sacred. The process works a little like the fusion of two photographs
in a stereoscopic viewer to trigger a vivid perception of the third
dimension represented in each two-dimensional photograph. Something
similar happens to many of us when, at particular moments, certain
impressions click together in our minds, and the mountain we are
climbing or seeing seems to come alive with a peculiar depth and
intensity that we have difficulty defining.<P>

<B>Major themes</B><BR>
Using specific examples, we will examine some of the most important and
widely distributed themes associated with mountains. These themes have
been selected for their potential to suggest general guidelines for
doing research and formulating policy for protected areas. Others could,
and should, be chosen for further exploration. Many of the themes
overlap and imply each other, suggesting that we not treat them as
distinct, isolated views of mountains to be analysed apart from each
other.<P>
        Many sacred mountains are first and foremost places of power.
This power is often regarded as dangerous, a source of fear to be
treated with the greatest care and respect. In the past Maori warriors
crossing the plateau beneath Mount Tongariro would avert their eyes from
its summit for fear of provoking a blinding snowstorm (Yoon 1986). Maori
conceptions of the mana of tapu mountains such as Tongariro emphasise
the sheer power of a sacred mountain that makes it forbidden to ordinary
humans. <P>
        The power of mountains can assume various forms. The five yeh
or principal sacred mountains of China, Tai Shan in particular,
enshrined the political authority of the emperor to rule over the four
quarters of his empire, supported by the mandate of Heaven (Chavannes
1910). The molten lava of Kilauea in Hawai'i embodies for many Hawaiians
the fiery destructive and creative energy of the volcano goddess Pele.
As this example shows, the power of a sacred mountain can be both
natural and supernatural. Many people attribute this power to deities
who reside on mountains or are identified with the peaks themselves, as
Pele is with Kilauea.<P>
        Another widespread theme, especially in areas influenced by
Hinduism and Buddhism, is that of the mountain as centre. A number of
mountains that embody this theme, such as Mount Kailas in Tibet and
Gunung Agung in Bali, are patterned on the mythical Mount Meru or
Sumeru, which stands as a cosmic axis around which the universe is
organised in Hindu and Buddhist cosmology. As a piece of Meru
transported there by the gods, Gunung Agung provides the Balinese with
their sense of geographical and psychological orientation  everything
on the island exists and finds its place in relation to the volcano
(Covarrubias 1946).<P>
        A number of mountains in East Asia, Japan in particular, are
viewed as centres of mandalas, circular spaces and arrangements of
deities used in Buddhist meditation. Some, such as Mounts Koya and
Omine, are treated as mandalas themselves, their peaks, trees, and other
natural features regarded as parts of a sacred circle representing the
divine space of a visualised deity with whom a meditator identifies
himself or herself (Bernbaum 1990). In a provocative article Allan
Grapard (1982) argues that in the period leading up to World War II such
mandalas spread out from sacred mountains to engulf the surrounding
landscape and transformed the entire country of Japan into a divine
nation in the eyes of its people.<P>
        Cultures tend to look up to mountains as sources of blessings 
most notably, water, fertility, life and healing. Mountains such as
Ausangate in Per, Tlaloc in Mexico and the San Francisco Peaks in
Arizona are revered as abodes of weather deities, places of springs, and
reservoirs of waters on which societies depend for their well-being and
existence (Reinhard 1985). In times of drought modernised Kikuyu of
Kenya still fall back on pre-Christian traditions and face Mount Kenya
to ask Ngai or God for rain. Today great numbers of elderly women climb
Tai Shan to make offerings to have grandchildren if their daughters or
daughter-in-laws have been infertile (Bernbaum 1990).<P>
        Female shamans in Japan and Korea routinely climb sacred
mountains to charge themselves with healing powers and conduct rituals
for their patients (Blacker 1975; Kendall 1985). The leading spiritual
doctor of the Wintun tribe in northern California feels that she gets
her power to heal from Mount Shasta, in particular from a sacred spring
in a pristine meadow threatened by the proposed development of a ski
area. Traditional singers or medicine men go to the four sacred
mountains of the Navajo in the south-western United States to obtain
medicinal herbs and pebbles; they also invoke these mountains in rituals
and sand paintings intended to restore a sick person to health and
harmony (Bernbaum 1990).<P>
        Another major theme is that of mountains as divine ancestors and
places of the dead, often involved in origin myths. Mount Koya has one
of the most impressive graveyards in Japan. East Africans traditionally
buried their dead facing sacred peaks such as Kilimanjaro and Mount
Kenya. Most of the major peaks in New Zealand, including Aoraki or Mount
Cook, are revered as ancestors of the Maori who came to the North and
South Islands in migration canoes (Orbell 1985). According to the origin
myth of the Korean people, they are descended from the union of a sky
god and a bear woman on the sacred mountain of Paekdu (Henthorn 1971).<P>
        As divine ancestors and places of origin, a number of mountains
provide different societies with their sense of communal identity. One
of the most dramatic examples of a sacred mountain holding a people
together is Mount Kaata in the Bolivian Andes. Joseph Bastien (1978) has
shown how the metaphor of Kaata as a human body unites the various
communities who live on its slopes into an organic unit that has been
able to resist all efforts to break it apart into smaller administrative
subdivisions. At intertribal gatherings Maori ritually identify
themselves by first stating their tribal mountain, followed by their
river, or lake, and then their chief (Yoon 1986).<P>
        The final theme to consider is that of the mountain as place of
spiritual revelation and transformation. Mount Sinai occupies a position
of particular prominence in the Bible as the awe-inspiring site where
God reveals the Torah, the basic teaching of Judaism, and the Ten
Commandments, the basis of law and ethics in Western civilisation.
Buddhist pilgrims to Wutai Shan in China expect to see manifestations of
Manjushri, the Bodhisattva of Wisdom, who may appear to them in the form
of a dragon, a prince seated on a lion, or as a ball of fire (Birnbaum
1986).<P>
        In China and Japan mountains are regarded as such ideal places
for meditation and spiritual transformation that the Chinese expression
for embarking on the practice of religion means literally 'to enter the
mountains' (Demiville 1965). Hua Shan, the most spectacular of the five
principal sacred peaks of China, was a favourite haunt of Taoist hermits
intent on transforming themselves into immortals. North American Plains
Indians of different tribes seek out high places for vision quests that
give them spiritual power and determine the course of their lives.<P>
        Many people today, both traditional and modern, seek out
mountains as places of spiritual renewal and transformation. Huang Shan,
Mount Fuji and the Diamond Mountains continue to inspire artists and
poets in China, Japan, and Korea. Europeans became interested in the
Alps for scientific and mountaineering reasons when philosophers and
poets such as Rousseau, Goethe and Shelley began to extol their
spiritually uplifting qualities (Bernbaum 1990). In the United States
John Muir, a major figure in the genesis of the modern-day environmental
movement, founded the Sierra Club primarily to preserve the Sierra
Nevada as a wilderness area where people could go for spiritual renewal.
Such motivations continue to inspire and energise the environmental
movement today. They also draw many visitors to parks and protected
areas in mountain regions. <P>

<B>Policy implications</B><BR>
These themes have a variety of implications for policy regarding
environmental and cultural preservation and sustainable use. In order to
develop general guidelines for policies in protected areas, we need to
examine their specific meanings in particular contexts. The same theme
can have different implications for different mountains in different
cultures.<P>
        It is also important to note that many cultures draw vitality
and cohesion from their relationship to mountains and other sacred
features of the landscape. Destroying what makes such a site sacred may
undermine a culture, resulting in adverse social, economic and
environmental impacts as the society falls apart and traditional
controls are lost.<P>
        This last point brings out an important role for managers of
protected areas. Under the impacts of modernisation, the influx of
outside forces, and population growth, many traditional beliefs and
practices that have been extremely effective in preserving the
environment are now being overwhelmed. Managers need to work with local
communities to support and revitalise these controls and adapt them to
new circumstances. An awareness of the themes we have looked at and
their implications can help to guide this process.<P>  
      The perceived power of a mountain frequently sustains a
community that holds it sacred. If development or conservation measures
appear to weaken that power, they may have negative consequences. In the
case of a mountain revered as a place of danger, a policy designed to
avoid such consequences might intentionally make access to its higher
slopes difficult in order to reinforce the mountain's mystique,
especially if it is not traditionally climbed. Managers might also want
to avoid planting grass and trees and to leave untouched rocky areas and
other features that are naturally devoid of wildlife and vegetation.<P>
        The power of many mountains comes from the perceived presence of
deities, often regarded as protectors of local communities. The
iconography and mythology of these mountain deities can provide
important clues for formulating policy. For example, if a deity appears
in association with certain domestic animals, these will probably be the
kind of livestock that should be allowed to graze on that deity's sacred
mountain. Not taking such considerations into account can alienate the
local community and cause unnecessary problems.<P>
        Sherpas in the Sagarmatha National Park of Nepal believe that
goats, yaks, and sheep are under the special protection of Khumbu Yul
Lha, the protector deity of the Khumbu region. They were outraged when
the park in 1983 banned the grazing of goats on the slopes of the god's
sacred mountain, Khumbila. Some of them feared that the action would
offend the deity and bring misfortune on their herds of yaks, on which
they depend for much of their livelihood (Stevens 1993). Greater
sensitivity on the part of park managers, perhaps allowing goats to
graze on certain parts of the mountain where they would do the least
damage, would have avoided creating suspicion and resentments that made
other park policies harder to implement. <P>
        Many mountain deities appear with particular wild animals, often
as their protectors: reinforcing this association in people's minds can
help to protect those animals. Vicunas are considered the domestic
livestock of apus or mountain deities of the Peruvian Andes. National
laws protecting these animals have helped to reinforce traditional
prohibitions on hunting them and other wildlife, based on fears of
offending their divine protectors (Bernbaum 1990).<P>
        Similar relationships may hold for plants as well as animals.
Holy Hills set aside by the Dai people of south-west China have
preserved valuable islands of biodiversity, largely through the belief
that all the plants and animals found on them are companions of the gods
that dwell there or else belong to their gardens. Traditional practices
that now need reinforcement in the face of modern pressures have until
recently prevented gathering, hunting, wood-chopping and cultivation on
these sacred hills, which occupy 1.5% to 2.5% of the local prefecture
(Pei 1993). <P>
        The perception of sacred mountains as centres may play an
important role in holding communities together. To keep such communities
from falling apart, policies may be needed to preserve, and even
reinforce, natural and man-made features that emphasise the symbolism of
a sacred mountain as a centre. These measures might include setting
aside a circle of undeveloped land around the peak or making sure that
nothing obscures views of it from important places, such as temples and
shrines.<P>
        Policy measures should build on motivations and practices people
already have for preserving mountains as sacred sources of water,
fertility, life and healing. For example, a community may be keeping a
mountain spring pure out of a belief that if they pollute it local
deities will inflict diseases on them. Sherpas avoid polluting springs
from fear that the lu or serpent deities residing in the water will
inflict leprosy on nearby residents. Rather than try to persuade them
that bacteria instead of gods or spirits cause illness, it would be more
respectful and effective to encourage them to hold both views
simultaneously, applying each where it is appropriate to the end of
safeguarding the water supply. This does not have to be contradictory:
traditional beliefs may lend support to arguments that spiritual
entities can act through bacteria as their material agents in the
physical world.<P>
        If a community views a mountain as a place of the dead, policies
should be formulated to encourage its members to treat it as they would
a cemetery containing the remains of their relatives. Just as cutting
down trees or overgrazing would be for some cultures a desecration of a
graveyard, so doing the same things on the mountain might offend the
spirits of ancestors on whom people depend for their well-being and
blessings. The presence of a kilometre and a half long cemetery on Mount
Koya in Japan has succeeded in preserving a magnificent forest of giant
cedars (Bernbaum 1990).<P>
        Protected area managers can work with local communities and
indigenous groups to preserve sacred mountains  along with their
environments  as symbols of communal and tribal identity. In the latter
part of the 19th century, Europeans in New Zealand were starting to buy
up parcels of land for sheep farms on Tongariro, the sacred mountain of
the Ngati Tuwharetoa. In order to keep the mountain whole and preserve
the power and integrity of the tribe, a European advisor counselled the
Paramount Chief, Horonuku Te Heuheu Tukino IV, to give Tongariro to the
Crown as a park for the benefit of everyone. This he did in 1887, and
Tongariro National Park became the first national park in New Zealand
and the fourth in the world (Lucas 1993).<P>
        The last theme to consider, that of mountains as places of
revelation and transformation, is the one most closely linked to issues
of tourism. Many people, ranging from pilgrims to tourists, go to
mountains seeking spiritual renewal and inspiration. Will their presence
in large numbers interfere with the practice of religious rituals and
meditation by indigenous practitioners, as well as the quality of their
own experience? On mountains where inspiration and renewal come from
quiet contemplation in a pristine environment the answer is yes. Either
visitors must be encouraged to walk quietly and leave little trace of
their passage, or they must be restricted as to where they can go. On
other mountains where inspiration and renewal come traditionally from
large numbers of people engaged in many different activities, such as
pilgrimage festivals, this may not be such a problem.<P>
        In some cases, rather than a pristine wilderness setting, a man-
made temple or some other human structure may enhance the spiritual
experience of the mountain and help to preserve its environment. In the
mountainous Khumbu region of Nepal near Mount Everest, sacred groves
around monasteries and temples have been better preserved than forests
protected by the Nepali government and the Sagarmatha National Park
(Stevens 1993). An effective policy for park administrators might be to
identify sacred sites in forest areas that need protecting and to
sponsor the construction of new shrines and the renovation of old ones
near those places, encouraging local religious leaders to declare the
surrounding forests sacred.<P>
        Many parks and wilderness areas in mountain regions have been
set aside for protection because of the cultural and spiritual values
placed on them by modern societies  values that often outweigh economic
and political considerations. In order to retain and cultivate this
important source of support, park managers need to adopt policies that
reinforce, rather than undermine, such values. For example, although it
may may not be as cost-effective in the short term, it may be preferable
for parks themselves to handle wilderness permits and make reservations
for campsites. Contracting such services out to ticket agencies may
alienate the public by appearing to commercialise the parks, reducing
them to theatres or amusement parks that no longer embody the natural
qualities of mountain environments that inspire a sense of renewal.
Visitors who deal directly with rangers will feel that that their money
is going for a good purpose and will have a greater sense of personal
involvement that will make them more inclined to support park systems
economically and politically. <P>

<B>Conclusions</B><BR>
For many people, both modern and traditional, the environment is not
just the natural environment. It includes cultural and spiritual aspects
that make it meaningful  a source of life in its deepest and broadest
sense. People who do rituals to draw water from a sacred mountain, for
example, do not view the water and mountain simply as physical parts of
the ecosystem needed to grow their crops. They see them as essential
components of a larger system of meaning, expressions of a deeper
reality that sustains them spiritually and culturally, as well as
physically.<P>
        A study of the role and significance of sacred mountains
suggests that we adopt a broader and deeper view of sustainable use.
Protected area managers and development administrators need to formulate
policies that take into account issues of cultural and spiritual, as
well as ecological and economic, sustainability. If trees are replanted,
clear-cut logging can be sustained from an economic point of view, but
the biodiversity of the forest will be lost. In a similar vein, measures
taken only to preserve the natural ecology without regard for what it
enshrines may kill the spirit of a place, destroying its value for the
people for whom it is important.<P>

<B>Legal brief<BR>
The Alpine Convention  a promise for the future?</B><P>

WOLFGANG E. BURHENNE<P>

<B>The Commission for the Protection of the Alpine Regions (CIPRA) was
created in 1952 upon the initiative of both governmental and non-
governmental representatives. In its first Programme of Action, the new
Commission stressed the necessity of negotiating and concluding a
convention conserving the alpine environment and natural resources.</B><P>

It was not, however, until 1989 that a Conference of Alpine States was
convened in Berchtesgaden, upon the initiative of the Minister of
Environment of the Federal Republic of Germany. After long discussions,
this conference decided to commence negotiations for a convention
covering the entire Alpine mountain range.<P>
        On 7 November 1991 the Alpine Convention was signed in Salzburg
by Austria, France, Germany, Italy, Lichtenstein, Switzerland, and the
European Community. Although Slovenia, as part of Yugoslavia, had taken
part in the negotiations, by the time the convention was ready for
signature that country was already in upheaval, and Slovenia signed the
Alpine Convention on 29 March 1993 as an independent state. In 1994 a
special protocol was concluded to allow for Monaco to become a Party.<P>
        The Convention entered into force on 6 March 1995, after
ratification by Austria, Liechtenstein and Germany. Since then France
has also ratified.<P>
        As is common in such instruments, the preamble sets out the
general purpose and goals of the Contracting Parties, recognising the
specific and multifaceted qualities of the natural environment as well
as the history and culture of the region as one of the largest natural
areas of its type in Europe. The text of the Convention describes the
territorial application of the treaty by reference to a map which is
contained in the annex. Each Contracting Party may, however, extend the
application of the Convention to other areas under its sovereignty by a
declaration addressed to the Republic of Austria as depository.
Likewise, such areas may be removed from the field of application of the
Convention by means of the same procedure.<P>
        The general obligations of the State Parties are determined by
Article 2 (1), which states the general principles governing the
Convention to be the principle of prevention, the polluter-pays
principle, the principle of cooperation, and the principle of the
preservation and protection of the Alps  taking into consideration the
interests of each Party, and the need to achieve the sustainable use of
resources. These principles are followed by a list of appropriate
measures to be taken in specific sectors, in order to attain the
aforementioned objectives (Article 2 (2)). Taken as a whole, the
enumerated sectors demonstrate the broad scope of the Convention. They
are:
<LI>       people and culture
<LI>        land use planning
<LI>       air quality
<LI>        soil protection
<LI>        water regimes
<LI>        protection of nature and landscape management
<LI>        mountain agriculture
<LI>        mountain forests
<LI>       tourism and leisure activities
<LI>       transport
<LI>       energy
<LI>       wastes<P>
        Articles 3 and 4 are concerned with the harmonisation and
development of research and monitoring activities as well as with
cooperation in the legal, scientific, economic, and technical fields.
Exchange of information and cooperation with international organisations
 governmental and non-governmental  as well as the provision of
information to the public on a regular basis on progress in those areas
are singled out by the text as appropriate means of action.<P> 
        The next block of articles are those concerning institutions.
The Conference of the Parties, i.e. the Alpine Conference, its meetings
and decision-making mechanisms, its functions and organs such as the
Standing Committee, are dealt with. Provision is also made for the
possibility of creating a permanent Secretariat.<P>
        The standard final clauses, including those on amendments to the
Convention or Protocols, ratification and accession, conclude the text.<P>
        The text of the Alpine Convention, therefore, clearly
demonstrates the classic elements of a so-called 'framework convention'
 that is, a treaty which is concerned with general principles as well
as obligations and which provides for the conclusion of special
Protocols which deal more thoroughly with specific subjects in greater
detail.<P>
        Because of its nature as a framework convention, the obligations
accepted by the State Parties remain very general. In accordance with
Article 2(3) these obligations are defined at the level of the
Protocols, which delineate measures to implement the terms of the
Convention. It was therefore essential that negotiation of the Protocols
began immediately: without them, the Convention would remain an empty
shell, without substance. This is the reason that CIPRA and the World
Conservation Union (IUCN) were constantly emphasising the necessity of
concluding the envisaged protocols to the Convention as rapidly as
possible.<P>
        Thus, work on that task began even before the Alpine Convention
entered into force, with parallel negotiations, with the result that
three Protocols were opened for signature at the same time on 20
December 1994: the Protocol for the implementation  of the Alpine
Convention in the field of town and country planning and sustainable
development; the Protocol for the implementation of the Alpine
Convention in the field of mountain agriculture; and the Protocol for
the implementation of the Alpine Convention in the field of nature
protection and landscape conservation. They have all been signed by
France, Germany, Italy, Monaco, Slovenia and the European Union. The
Protocol on town and country planning and sustainable development has
also been signed by Liechtenstein. None, however, has yet been signed by
Switzerland or Austria. In the former case, the difficulty lies with the
positions taken by the Swiss Cantons which would be affected: they claim
that the imposition of some of the obligations would have socio-economic
consequences which require increased subsidies. The case of Austria is
more circumscribed: the federal Government is blocked from taking any
action by the position of the Lnder which oppose the direction that the
negotiations of the Protocol on transport is taking. The Lnder, through
their Prime Ministers' Conference, want any further construction of
transalpine highways to be prohibited. The negotiators are at present
seeking a workable compromise on that point.<P>
        In contrast, the negotiations on the Protocol on mountain
forests are almost concluded. The negotiations on the soil preservation
Protocol have run into some difficulties, in particular with regard to
its field of application and definition of soil. Work on the Protocol on
energy is just beginning. That on tourism and leisure activities is
meeting with difficulties with regard to the provisions regarding the
production of artificial snow in areas where there are ski facilities. A
special meeting will take place in order to help find the consensus
which would be necessary in order that this Protocol be opened for
signature by the Ministers attending the next Alpine conference at the
end of February 19961.<P>
        In addition to the above efforts, an ambitious programme for
Alpine monitoring is already well under way.<P>
        Finally, during the last session of the Standing Committee to
the Convention, which was held in January of this year, the
representatives have come to an agreement concerning the rules of
procedure for the Alpine Conference and those of the Standing Committee.
The rules of procedure will provide inter alia for the participation of
international NGOs at the Conference and at meetings of the Standing
Committee.<P>
        Within the framework of this short overview of the status of the
Convention and the ongoing negotiations of Protocols it has not been
possible to analyse the obligations already imposed or those
contemplated in any detail. It is however important to stress that the
over-riding rule is that of consensus, and that as a consequence it must
be understood that the provisions which have been adopted are not all as
stringent as CIPRA or IUCN would have wished.<P>
        However, the result as a whole shows progress  a progress which
may become a really significant tool for continuing work on the
conservation of the Alps. This can only become a reality, however, if
the Contracting Parties take the necessary steps to bring the Protocols
to the Convention into force as soon as possible  and then firmly
implement the measures they require.<P>
        Law can but provide the means to the application of political
will!<P>

<I>Wolfgang E. Burhenne served in a voluntary capacity as the first
Secretary of CIPRA, under the Presidency of Charles Bernard, who was
also President of IUCN. Dr Burhenne represents IUCN at the negotiations
related to the Alpine Convention and its Protocols.</I><P>


1 Publisher's note: This article was prepared by Dr Burhenne in January
1996, but is only now being published due to unforeseen delays in
producing this issue of PARKS. Dr Burhenne informs us that there have
been further developments within the Alpine Convention since January,
the most important being that legally binding Protocols on tourism and
on mountain forests have been signed. There is still no agreement on a
Protocol for transport.<P>

<B>Identifying the world's most outstanding mountains</B><P>

JIM THORSELL<P>

<B>I have in my mountain reference library a number of books that profess
to describe which are the world's most outstanding mountains. Most are
written by the legions of mountain travellers and climbers. All are
liberally dosed with the awe-inspiring photographs that mountains lend
themselves to.<P></B>

But there is another approach to defining which are the world's most
outstanding mountains  the World Heritage Convention. In this case,
government members of this international legal conservation instrument
make formal applications to inscribe what they feel are their 'best'
natural and cultural heritage sites. The world heritage point of
departure when it comes to mountains is not only their attraction to
alpinists but their overall value to humanity for science and
conservation.<P>
        Through the mechanism of the World Heritage Convention, five
individual mountains and 31 mountain ranges have made it through the
rigorous IUCN selection procedure and been inscribed on the prestigious
list of World Heritage sites (see list below). The process is not over,
however, as there are many gaps left. In Asia, for example, there is no
natural World Heritage site in the Karakorum or the mountains of central
Asia outside the Himalayas. Work is progressing on a nomination of the
new Central Karakorum National Park and for one of the nature reserves
in the Altai. Kailas as one of the world's acknowledged sacred peaks has
also been suggested for potential cultural landscape nomination. The
Chinese portion of Mount Everest is an obvious missing piece out of
Nepal's Sagarmatha World Heritage site. The spectacular volcanoes in
Kamchatka are being assessed by IUCN in 1996 and several more in Russia
are soon to be nominated (surely something in the Caucasus would
qualify).<P>
        Elsewhere in south-east Asia Kinabalu in Malaysia and Lorentz in
Indonesia stand out as obvious potential candidates. Both are well known
for their scientific values and are protected as National Parks.<P>
        In Africa, Mount Kenya has been proposed as a potential World
Heritage site at a recent meeting of the African Mountain Association.
South Africa is said to be considering one of the mountain parks in the
Drakensburgs as well as several of the fynbos reserves in the Cape
mountains.<P>
        In the European Alps, nature has been subject to millennia of
human intervention and there has been difficulty in defining what could
be appropriate as a natural site. Northern Scandinavia is addressing
this issue by nominating their northern mountains as a cultural
landscape to take into account the Sami peoples interaction in that
setting. France and Spain have joined forces to nominate a transfrontier
park in the Pyrenees for review in 1996.<P>
        In Norway, Iceland and Greenland other mountains are being
considered for nomination including the huge NE Greenland National Park
and the national park on Spitzbergen.<P>
        In North America, the western Cordillera is already quite well
represented (some would say over-represented) in the current system of
World Heritage sites. Nevertheless the Brooks Range/British Mountains on
the border of Alaska and the Yukon would merit attention as would the
Torngats in Labrador. The international significance of the mountains of
the arctic islands in northern Canada have not yet been assessed.<P>
        In Latin America, Chile is considering a nomination for the
large temperate wilderness centred around the Bernardo O'Higgins/Torres
de Paine complex. At the northern end of the Andes, the Santa Marta area
of Colombia may soon also be proposed for the List for mixed cultural
and natural reasons.<P>
        In conclusion, the above 'shopping list' summarises initiatives
now under way to nominate further Mountain World Heritage sites. As IUCN
plays a quasi-judicial role in evaluating new nominations, we cannot
make any pre-judgments but it would be fair to say that most of the
above mentioned sites would have a reasonable chance of inscription on
the World Heritage list. It is also recognised that State Parties to the
Convention (now numbering 145 countries) are the only ones that can
submit nominations. But with eight World Heritage nominations in
mountains having been submitted for 1996, the process of identifying the
world's most outstanding mountains has advanced further than that of any
other biome.<P>

<EM>Makalu-Barun National Park and Conservation Area Management Plan</EM>, submitted
by the Task Force for the Makalu-Barun Conservation Project, November 1990.<BR>
This is the compilation of results and recommendations of the four Components,
based on a two-year study conducted by the Task Force (1988-90) wherein most of the Working Papers were prepared. The Management Plan calls for the establishment of the MBNPCA, with primary objectives being to protect this area of unusual natural beauty and biological diversity, to improve the socio-economic conditions of local people, and to develop models for sustainable conservation and development. Implementation of the Plan's policies incorporate traditional management systems as much as possible and the active   participation of local people. Training and availability of production credit for income generation are key components, as is education of both children and
adults, particularly women. The Plan gives an overview of the issues, recommends policies and programs, and presents the administration structure of the MBCP. <BR> <STRONG>85 pgs.</STRONG>

A detailed plan outlining MBCP's policies and programs to conduct economically and environmentally sustainable development activities with maximum community participation in the Makalu-Barun Conservation Area. Five-year time-lines identify activities in forest management, livestock and grazing, educational training, infrastructure, credit facilities, horticulture, rural industries (e.g., lokta, allo, bamboo products, cash crops, medicinal plants, etc.),     slash and burn, intensive agriculture, marketing development, culture conservation and human services with a summary budget.<BR>  <STRONG>176 pgs.</STRONG>

<EM>"Faces of a Reservation: A Portrait of the Warm
Springs Indian Reservation"</EM><BR>
By Stowell, C.D, Oregon Historical Society Press, 1987. 200 pages. ISBN 0-87595-203-8<P>
Text and photographs by Cynthia D. Stowell<P>
High in the Cascade Mountains of Oregon, USA lies the Warm Springs Indian
Reservation, a cultural and economic powerhouse that could be a model for
many mountain peoples.  Following the theme "Paying for Mountains", this
case study illustrates, more than anything, the critical importance of
strong local leadership.  Through capable decision-making, coupled with
persistence, a long-term outlook, deliberate diversification, and an ability
to adapt to changing circumstances, the Warm Springs Indians have created a
homeland that offers decent jobs as well as cultural richness.
<P>
Ancestors of the people of Warm Springs are believed to have occupied what
is now Oregon for at least 11,000 years.  As a result of the westward
expansion of white settlers, in 1855 a treaty was signed between the tribes
of middle Oregon and the U.S. government.  This treaty ceded 10 million
acres of land in return for the equivalent of 150,000 dollars in tools,
clothing, provisions, salaries, and the right to continue fishing at
traditional sites.  Half a million acres of poor mountain land on the edge
of their traditional range was set aside as the Warm Springs Indian
Reservation, where several tribes, including the Sahaptin, Wasco, and
Paiute, were forced to relocate.
<P>
Many Indian reservations have lost huge portions of their acreage or have
been terminated altogether since their establishment more than a century
ago.  Warm Springs has been lucky to have had leaders who effectively fought
the many attempts to reduce the size of their reservation, including
privatization (and subsequent re-sale to non-Indians), inaccurate surveys,
and frequent changes in the legal status of reservation land.
<P>
In 1957, a major setback -- the loss of traditional salmon fishing sites on
the Columbia River, due to flooding caused by The Dalles dam, was turned to
advantage.  The Tribes negotiated for a 4 million dollar settlement from the
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and proceeded to invest this money wisely in
their own future.  Rather than distributing the entire settlement among
tribal members (as is commonly done), the money was held in trust for the
reservation as a whole.  
<P>
The first big expenditure was a university study of the reservation's
natural resources and their potential for sustainable economic development.
Deliberate diversification led to investments in a number of economic
activities, about half of which were successful.  Today, the fruits of this
policy include a stable forest products industry, a luxury resort, a
hydroelectric plant (plus rental monies from two utility-owned dams), and
more jobs than people to fill them.  The reservation is filled with young
people, and a lively museum/cultural center celebrates the cultures of the
Tribes, both past and present.
<P>
One idea comes through clearly -- whatever course the wise and resilient
people of Warm Springs take in the future, it will be of their own choosing.

<a name="CARE"><h3><b>Patient Centered Care</b><br></h3></a>
We understand that no two medical problems or patients are alike, and treatments must be individualized to every patient's needs.<p>
 That's why the medical staff of the ATLANTA REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CENTRE is committed to finding medical solutions for each person who seeks care from us.<p>
 We never attempt to fit an individual into a generic treatment mold.<p>
To provide the personalized quality care for which we've become nationally recognized, we spend hours with ourpatients and their partners to <p><dl><dd><I>First</I>, identify and diagnose the problem;<p><DD>
<I>Second</I>, develop a partnership with each patient and her support team which may include her husband, another relative or friend and her referring physician;<p><DD>
<I>Third</I>, outline medical or surgical options;<p><DD>
<I>Fourth</I>, initiate a cost-effective treatment plan that combines the highest quality of care with the best possible outcome.</dl><a name="CONFID"><p><h3><b>Confidentiality</b><br></h3></a>
We work hard to protect our patients' privacy. We do not release medical records or any portion of them without written authorization from the patient.<p>
<a name="HOURS"><h3><b>Office Hours </b><br></h3></a>

Our office is open Monday through Friday from 7:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. We try to be flexible for situations when it maybe necessary to see patients outside of regular office hours. Saturday and Sunday morning appointments are available for ultrasound monitoring, insemination, egg retrievals and pre-embryo transfers.<p>
<a name="STYLE"><h3><b>Open Communication</b><br></h3>
The best patient is a well-informed one.<p>
We value an open and ethical relationship with each patient who, we believe, is entitled to complete knowledge about her reproductive health.<p>
In an environment of trust and mutual respect, our patients and their partners feel free to ask questions at any time.<p>
We promise to answer all the questions asked -- and even those that aren't.<p>
It's the only way to build partnerships with every patient, her spouse and her referring physician. As a team, we allwork together to achieve the best possible outcome.<p>
<a name="NET"><h3><b>Internet Access</b><br></h3>
All visitors are welcome at our comprehensive Internet website, <a href="http://www.ivf.com">http://www.ivf.com</a> where information is readily available on the medical practice and reproductive health issues.<p>
The website offers menus that include a revised copy of Dr. Perloe's book, Miracle Babies and Other Happy Endings for Couples with Fertility Problems, and layers of detailed reports about reproductive medicine from many sources.<p>
Internet visitors can contact Dr. Perloe, <a href="http://www.ivf.com/guestbook/addguest.html">sign</a> or <a href="http://www.ivf.com/guestbook/addguest.html">peruse the guestbook</a>, <a href="quest.html">ask a question</a>, <a href="multi.html">tour the ARHC multimedia gallery</a> or join a discussion in the soon to be launched chatrooms. <p>
<a name="PAY"><h3><b>Financial Matters</b><br></h3>
Most health insurers do not cover infertility. Conversely, many insurers will provide coverage for some gynecological diagnoses. However, we do not accept assignment for office visit charges unless we have a contract with your insurer or your health insurer's written authorization or referral for your appointment.<p>Payment for medical, lab and diagnostic services provided in the office is due at the time of service. If we have a managed care contract with your insurer, you are expected to pay for the deductible and/or co-pay at the time of service. To keep patient accounts current, we accept Mastercard, Visa and Discover cards or we will verify your personal check.<p>Depending on your diagnosis, you may be able to obtain some reimbursement for your care. Your receipt for payment will contain the standard diagnosis, medical and surgical treatment codes used by the majority of health insurers.

<p>


<a name="APPT"><h3><b>Your Appointment</b><br></h3>
<I><B>Step 1: </B></I>Call (404) 265-3662. Our staff conducts a preliminary telephone interview to assure that we are adequately prepared for the appointment. If necessary for insurance coverage, a referral authorization must be signed and in our office before an appointment can be scheduled.<p>
We attempt to see patients with urgent medical or surgical conditions as quickly as possible.<p>

<I><B>Step 2: </B></I>Once the appointment is scheduled, our staff sends the patient a Welcome Packet with detailed information about ATLANTA REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CENTRE. The packet also includes authorizations for release of medical information, and a new patient questionnaire for both partners to complete and bring the initial appointment.<p>
<I><B>Step 3: </B></I>Before the appointment, the Patient must take the authorization for release of medical information to her prior physician(s) and hospital(s) and obtain copies of relevant medical records. In addition, patients should obtain copies of<p>
<dl><dd>surgical notes and videotapes, <p><dd>actual (not copies, not reports) x-ray films, <p><dd>copies of laboratory tests,<p><dd>her health insurance manual.<p></dl>
Infertility evaluations require a spouse to sign a separate authorization for release of medical information to obtain copies of his records and semen analysis reports.<p>
All medical information should be delivered to ATLANTA REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CENTER for Dr. Perloe to review before your first appointment.<p>
For a fertility assessment, both partners should be present at the first appointment which usually takes two hours. This visit usually costs about $200 plus additional fees for lab or other diagnostic test which can run the total as high as $500. If you are not prepared for this expense at the time of your visit, you should let us know immediately so that additional testing can be postponed.<p>

<a name="REVIEW"><h3><b>Medical Record Review and Analysis</b><br></h3>
Many patients oustide Atlanta choose to visit for a thorough evaluation and treatment of their reproductive problem. Others seek more limited information. Medical record reviews can provide<p><dl><dd>Reassurance that you seem to be on the right track<p><dd>Questions to ask your own physician<p><dd>Access to the latest material about a particular medical concern. <p></dl>Please understand that without an examination, Dr. perloe can not make a diagnosis or order specific tests, recommend treatments or act as your physician. The information you will receive is not intended as a substitute for the medical advice of your own physician. You should should regularly consult a physician in matters relating to your health and particularly with respect to any symptoms that may require diagnosis or medical attention.<p>

To arrange a medical record review call our office (404) 265-3662 and ask them to fax or mail a new patient evaluation form and payment information form. This is then completed and mailed back to us together with ALL your medical records, films, videotapes etc. The value of this record review consult and interview will be limited if all available info is not provided.<p>
If you wish to arrange a telephone consult with Dr. Perloe, please provide several times and a phone number where you can receive a collect call.<p> The fee for a medical record analysis and summary report is $89 and $129 for medical record analysis and telephone interview. If you need your films or videos returned, please make sure you enclose a completed fedex or UPS billing form.<p>

People from virtually every country have visited. The site averages over 3,000 visits per week! Many visitors seek additional information and send an email. Unfortunately as the volume of email continues to grow, my ability to provide updates and additional articles has been limited. In order to maintain the quality of this site, I must continue to invest the time to keep its content fresh. Unfortunately that limits my ability to respond to each and every email message.

 That's why the medical staff of the ATLANTA REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CENTRE is committed to finding medical solutions for each person who seeks care from us.<p>

 We never attempt to fit an individual into a generic treatment mold.<p>

To provide the personalized quality care for which we've become nationally recognized, we spend hours with ourpatients and their partners to <p><dl><dd><I>First</I>, identify and diagnose the problem;<p><DD>

<a name="PAY"><h3><b>Financial Matters</b><br></h3>

Most health insurers do not cover infertility. Conversely, many insurers will provide coverage for some gynecological diagnoses. However, we do not accept assignment for office visit charges unless we have a contract with your insurer or your health insurer's written authorization or referral for your appointment.<p>Payment for medical, lab and diagnostic services provided in the office is due at the time of service. If we have a managed care contract with your insurer, you are expected to pay for the deductible and/or co-pay at the time of service. To keep patient accounts current, we accept Mastercard, Visa and Discover cards or we will verify your personal check.<p>Depending on your diagnosis, you may be able to obtain some reimbursement for your care. Your receipt for payment will contain the standard diagnosis, medical and surgical treatment codes used by the majority of health insurers.

<B>The ARHC WWW has gone shareware.</B> As this site has grown in popularity, it has become harder to respond to all questions. I spend a significant amount of time to review your background and your question and then attempt, respond appropriately.

By educating yourself and learning what questions to ask, you can enhance the value of your physician visit. Armed with the information contained in this WWW you can become a better healthcare consumer and save money.

<H4>Welcome to ARHC Infertility Chatroom</H4>
Thanks for visiting our chatroom. The java chat applet may take a few minutes to load on your computer. When the loading is completed, the gray square at the bottom of this page will contain the chat winndow. You may float the chat window and continue to browse on the web if you like. A second endometriosis chat room will be available soon.

<b>Due to the volume of traffic on the chat server, you may experience a delay of up to two or three minutes for the chat program to initialize. Please be patient. (A little MD humor) The grey box will be replaced with a chat window when the java script has completely transferred.
