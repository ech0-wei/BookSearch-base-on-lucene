<H2><A NAME="Introduction">Introduction</A></H2>
<P>
The Remote Sensing Group is active in applications for remote
sensing using sensors in the frequency band from VHF to sub millimetre
waves. The aim is to develop applications of new sensors for environmental
monitoring. Satellite applications dominate but airborne and ground-based
techniques are also of interest.
<H2><A NAME="INSAR">Developments in INSAR technology. </A></H2>
<P>
An ESA project for calibration and validation of the SAR for the
future Envisat satellite has been ongoing. Methods for calibration
of the VHF SAR CARABAS have been developed.
<P>
Using two or more SAR images over the same area it is possible
to extract two parameters, coherence and phase. The coherence
is related to the stability on the scale of the radar wavelength
and phase is related to the location of the imaged object. Coherence
has been shown to be a useful tool for classification of different
land covers, see below. 
<P>
For interferometric SAR methods for slope corrections of the radar
backscatter have been developed.
<P>
The phase measurements have been shown to be an accurate measure
of the ground topography in an area in Northern Sweden.
<P>
A semi-automatic differential INSAR processor has been developed
where the inputs are two SAR images and one DEM (Digital Elevation
Model).
<P>
Many of the INSAR developments have been carried out under an
ESA contract co-ordinated by Matra Cap Systems for studying applications
of interferometric SAR. The Remote Sensing Group has had the main
responsibility for forestry.
<H3>Coherence estimation</H3>
<P>
A very important step in INSAR is to estimate coherence and phase
correctly. Coherence estimation is often biased for low coherence.
The bias depends on window size and assumed ground topography
over the window. There is a trade-off between overestimation and
underestimation of the coherence. Overestimation can be decreased
using larger windows but then assumptions of the ground topography
will not longer be valid and that will underestimate the coherence.
Using an available digital elevation model, DEM, will more or
less eliminate the effect of underestimation. Current efforts
are to further analyse the statistics of the images and the known
estimators in order to reduce the bias.
<H3>Temporal and volume decorrelation</H3>
<P>
In the case of a time interval between image acquisitions (repeat-pass
interferometry), the ground area is likely to change, thus causing
temporal decorrelation. Volume decorrelation occurs over areas
which have scatterers distributed over different heights e.g.
in crown, trunk and undergrowth layers in forests. Under many
conditions it is impossible to discriminate between temporal and
volume decorrelation, but when the two images are taken from almost
the same position (within about 100 metres) the volume correlation
becomes negligible,  leaving the temporal decorrelation. Our studies
show that the temporal decorrelation is the major discriminating
factor in INSAR images. The temporal changes can be split into
two factors; geometrical and dielectric changes. Geometrical changes
(due mostly to wind) are believed to be the major cause of decorrelation
in forests on a short time scale (almost instantaneous) while
dielectric changes will work on longer time scales (over a few
days, depending mainly on changes in weather conditions). Tropospheric
influence on INSAR
<P>
For accurate phase measurements the error due to the atmospheric
delay is an important factor, and an investigation of the atmospheric
influence on the accuracy of derived DEM:s from INSAR has started
based on the long experience of water vapour radiometer observations
as well as GPS observations.
<H2><A NAME="Seaice">Remote Sensing of Sea Ice</A></H2>
<H3>Modelling of SAR signatures from sea ice</H3>
<P>
An extensive program on modelling of the radar backscatter from
sea ice has been ongoing for validation of satellite remote sensing
using synthetic aperture radar. Models help in understanding risks
of misinterpretation of single sensor signatures. Level and deformed
ice, frazil, frost flowers, new ice, leads etc. have been studied.
Of special interest has been ice ridges due to the problems associated
with ship navigation, and signatures of frost flowers etc. giving
rise to similar signatures as deformed ice. 
<H3>Baltic Sea Ice</H3>
<H4>EMAC'95</H4>
<P>
For increased information about radar scattering properties multi
frequency is important. Optimal frequency combinations for future
satellite missions are also important to investigate.
<P>
As part of the European Multi-Sensor Airborne Campaign (EMAC-95)on
Snow and Ice 1995 in Finland radar signatures of smooth low-salinity
level ice in the Gulf of Bothnia were measured by means of a ship
mounted scatterometer operating at L, S, C, and X-band. Utilising
the ranging capability of the scatterometer system the dominant
scattering contributions as function of depth in the ice were
located for the different frequencies. Together with <I>in situ</I>
ice and snow observations and using radar scattering modelling
it was found that the X-band scattering is caused by volume inhomogeneities
in the uppermost part of the ice, the C- and S-band scattering
by the roughness of the snow-ice interface, while at L-band dominant
radar returns originate also from the ice-water interface. In
conclusion C- and L-band would be complementary for SAR sea ice
monitoring in the Baltic.
<H4>Sea ice displacements by INSAR</H4>
<P>
Interferometric SAR technique, INSAR, can be used to measure surface
displacements between acquisitions. This has attracted much interest
for earthquake and landslide monitoring. It can also be used to
measure displacements over fast ice. 
<P>
Over the fast ice in the Bay of Bothnia, we have measured displacements
on the cm level over approx. 2010 km<SUP>2</SUP>. Such measurements
are believed to be unique. Current efforts are to model the ice
displacements and compare with INSAR measurements.
<H3>Arctic Sea Ice</H3>
<H4>Ice type classification</H4>
<P>
Ice concentration in the Arctic derived from ERS-1 SAR and the
SSM/I together with field observations consisting of ship observations
and helicopter video from the Arctic-91 expedition were compared.
The studied areas were characterised by melting conditions and
new ice formation with frost flowers. For interpretation temporal
sequences of the SAR images and meteorological information was
used. It was found that SSM/I may underestimate the ice concentration
by 20 per cent due to thin ice formation and melting conditions
while SAR may overestimate. This illustrates the importance of
combining information from different sensors. By using the SAR
estimate of different ice classes it is believed to be possible
to increase the accuracy of the ice concentration. 
<H4>Ice motion derivation</H4>
<P>
 Optical flow and other algorithms have been derived in the group
for ice motion derivation. The basic assumptions in the optical
flow analysis are that image brightness is stationary and the
velocity field is constant within a small neighbourhood. An error
analysis is made and two criteria introduced for testing the possibility
of using the optical flow method. Some smoothing has to take place
in order to increase the estimate accuracy of sea ice motion.
To avoid an ill-conditioned problem a conditioning number is introduced.
A test of the non-uniformity of the velocity field is also introduced.
The two criteria are used for choosing the spatial resolution
suitable for an automatic optical flow analysis. The method has
been applied to three image pairs from Arctic-91 and with a pixel
spacing of 200 m. The rms. error between the automatic method
and manually identified control points in the images was found
to vary between 640 and 730 meters. The same area (the Yermak
plateau) has been observed during the expedition in 1996 and the
work will continue using these images when available. 
<P>
 A matching algorithm based on a similarity measure, the sum-of-squared
difference (SSD), has also been tested with the same three image
pairs as used in the optical flow method. The experimental results
obtained with both optical flow method and SSD method are in a
good agreement. Arctic Ocean Expedition 1996
<H4>Arctic Ocean Expedition 1996</H4>
<P>
Preparations for the Arctic Ocean Expedition 1996 has been ongoing
during the period of the biennial report. A team consisting of
participants from Alfred Wegener Institute, Chalmers University
of Technology, Helsinki University, Helsinki University of Technology,
and SMHI carried out a program in Remote Sensing and Sea Ice in
July - September 1996. Synthetic aperture radar images from RADARSAT
and ERS-2 are provided by support from the Canadian and European
Space Agencies, respectively. 
<H2><A NAME="Forestry">Remote Sensing of land cover and Forestry</A>
</H2>
<H3>Forestry using CARABAS</H3>
<P>
Microwave SAR signatures are saturated at relatively low stem
volumes. Lower frequencies have increased potential to estimate
high stem volumes or biomass. CARABAS is an airborne VHF synthetic
aperture radar system developed by the National Defence Research
Organisation. Images have been provided from Ottenbylund, &Ouml;land,
and from Maine, USA. Field investigations have taken place at
Ottenbylund and it has been shown that the sensitivity for stem
volume has not saturated like higher frequency SAR systems for
the observed stem volume (up to 210 m<SUP>3</SUP>/ha). References
[117-119, 216, 218].
<P>
A program for developing models for the radar scattering is ongoing.
Compared to models developed at higher frequencies it is important
to investigate what forest properties dominate the scattering,
to what extent coherent interactions take place and to what extent
ground penetration takes place. 
<H3>INSAR Forestry applications and land cover applications</H3>
<P>
In order to understand INSAR images over forested areas, it is
important to develop models which relate geophysical parameters
to the parameters in the images, i.e. coherence and phase. The
current forest model is an extension of the &quot;water cloud
model&quot; developed for normal SAR images. It includes the volume
and temporal decorrelation of the forests and also gives a phase
measure. 
<P>
Observations illustrate that the coherence and interferometric
height varies in different images. A model has been developed
based on how the scattering from the forest layers is combined
with ground scattering from areas within the forest, either attenuated
by the canopy or not. Crucial information is the percentage of
open areas within the forest and the attenuation through the canopy
together with the temporal stability of the canopy scattering.
Available information on these properties is limited and uncertain,
but best estimates result in reasonable agreement between theory
and observations. 
<P>
Using the coherence together with the intensity it is possible
to classify different land covers. Results indicate that the separation
of forest from non-forest areas is much easier using coherence
measurements than in intensity images. However, the coherence
results indicate a difficulty in discriminating between open fields
and clear cut areas of forest. In this case the intensity information
can be used to complement coherence measurements. Although we
have concentrated on boreal forests, initial results from an area
in the Amazon rain forest indicate that coherence can still be
used for the important task of identifying areas of cutting within
forested regions.
<H3>DEM production</H3>
<P>
INSAR images can also be used to produce accurate digital height
maps (Digital Elevation Models). An important problem is that
less accurate measurements are derived over forests due to the
low coherence and that the forest will give a contribution to
the height measurement. This effect can be modelled by the above
forest model. However, it is still possible to produce DEM:s from
INSAR images. Over an area in Northern Sweden covered partly with
boreal forests, we have achieved an accuracy of 5 m RMS error
(using 20 m pixel size) for the DEM (compared to a real DEM) for
one INSAR image. Of course, by using several INSAR images the
error will decrease. The bias between the ground level DEM and
the INSAR measured DEM is caused by the forest height. 
<H2><A NAME="Atmosphere">Remote Sensing of the middle atmosphere</A>
</H2>
<P>
In the group the retrieval of vertical profiles from passive radiometric
observations of the middle atmosphere is studied. This work is
performed to analyse the measurements from a ground-based instrument
under construction at Onsala Space Observatory (22.2 and 110-116
GHz) and the aeronomical measurements of the Odin satellite (480-580
GHz). None of the sensors is yet working operationally and the
work has been concentrated on simulating system properties and
estimating different error sources. 
<P>
To study the profile retrieval accuracy of the future observations
is of course of general interest but it can also be a help in
the construction work because the importance of different instrumental
limitations is revealed in the theoretical examination. 
<P>
Simulation of a ground-based observation is relatively straightforward
and focus has been put to comparing the performance of different
retrieval methods. The methods have been studied both theoretically
and practically by inverting simulated spectra. Several important
differences were found but no method was found to be superior
in all occasions, the choice of retrieval scheme must be selected
according to the purpose of the observation. The influence of
different error sources has also been examined. The importance
of suppressing the baseline ripple to enable ozone in the lower
stratosphere to be satisfactory retrieved was shown. 
<P>
To simulate a satellite limb sounding observation is more complex.
A model of the radiative transfer in the atmosphere and the most
important instrumental characteristics of the sensor has been
implemented and observations have been successively simulated.
The expected retrieval accuracy has been studied for different
observation conditions and a number of species, including O<SUB>3</SUB>,
ClO, HNO<SUB>3</SUB>, and H<SUB>2</SUB>O. It was found that the
fixed design of the Odin sub-mm receiver enables simultaneous
observation of at least four species and suggestions on suitable
instrumental settings for observations in the stratosphere and
the mesosphere have been given.

<H1>Forest backscatter mechanisms in CARABAS VHF SAR imagery 
<BR>
</H1>
<P>
An analysis of CARABAS SAR images (28-60 MHz) from a forested
area on the island of &Ouml;land in southern Sweden has been performed.
The result show that the dynamic range of the backscattering coefficient
among the forest stands is higher than what has been found in
conventional SAR microwave frequencies in studies of similar forests.
<P>
During the fall of 1996 a test experiment &quot;BALTASAR&quot;
has been performed in southern Sweden with the new generation
of CARABAS. As part of this experiment forest areas were investigated.
<P>
The aim of this project is to carry out experiments verifying
the CARABAS sensitivity for forest parameters and to develop a
model for low frequency radar backscattering from forests.

<H1>Exjobb vid Radio- och Rymdvetenskap med inriktning mot mikrov&aring;gsfj&auml;rranalys.
</H1>
<P>
Institutionen f&ouml;r Radio- och Rymdvetenskap med Onsala Rymdobservatorium
kan erbjuda intressanta examensarbeten inom flera olika forskningsomr&aring;den.
F&ouml;r en fullst&auml;ndig upps&auml;ttning se <A HREF="http://www.oso.chalmers.se/">Onsala-listan</A>.
Nedan finner du, efter en presentation av gruppens forskningsverksamhet,
beskrivningar av aktuella examensarben, liksom namn p&aring; kontaktpersoner.
<P>
Egna id&eacute;er till projekt kan naturligtvis ocks&aring; diskuteras.
<H2>Aktuell forskning vid fj&auml;rranalysgruppen </H2>
<P>
Fj&auml;rranalysgruppen utnyttjar elektromagnetiska sensorer alltifr&aring;n
VHF till millimeter v&aring;gor f&ouml;r observationer av v&aring;r
egen jord, t ex f&ouml;r att utr&ouml;na utstr&auml;ckning och
egenskaper hos havsis, f&ouml;r att kartl&auml;gga skogar och
v&aring;tmarker, eller f&ouml;r att utforska ozonskiktet. M&aring;nga
av till&auml;mpningarna handlar s&aring;ledes om milj&ouml;m&auml;tteknik.
En stor del av arbetet &auml;r f n fokuserat p&aring; den europeiska
milj&ouml;satelliten ERS-1 med dess syntetiska aperturradar (SAR).
SAR-principen anv&auml;nder satellitens r&ouml;relse f&ouml;r
att syntetisera en st&ouml;rre antenn, och d&auml;rmed erh&aring;lls
en mycket h&ouml;g uppl&ouml;sning. Genom att modellera hur radarsignalerna
v&auml;xelverkar med mediet och j&auml;mf&ouml;ra med in situ-m&auml;tningar,
kan slutsatser dras om hur radarbilderna skall tolkas. Forskningen
&auml;r allts&aring; inriktad p&aring; v&aring;gutbredning och
mikrov&aring;gssystem. Verksamheten syftar till att utveckla nya
och avancerade sensorer mot en viss m&ouml;tuppgift, vilket inneb&auml;r
att verksamheten omfattar alltifr&aring;n systemegenskaper, elektromagnetisk
spridning, bildbehandling, signalextraktion etc. Olika examensarbeten
kan ha sin huvudinriktning mot olika aspekter.<BR>

Eng. thesis in the Henry Wallman room (Elektrog&aring;rden 1,

<H1>Applications of spaceborne SAR interferometry</H1>
<P>
Abstract:
<P>
Spaceborne SAR interferometry has provided several potential applications,
both commercial and environmental, e.g. digital height maps, land
cover classified images, earthquake and volcano assessments etc.
This report deals mainly with the accuracy of the measured parameters
in SAR interferometry. A system model is described to characterise
different effects in the system. A description of error sources
is included as well as a thorough description of estimation techniques.
Coherence and phase estimates are shown to be biased under certain
conditions. Height estimates suffers from several errors, e.g.
biasing, orbital modelling and atmospheric-induced errors. Four
of the applications are covered, digital height maps, forest monitoring,
land cover classification and shore-fast sea ice monitoring together
with an error analysis of results. For example, derived digital
height maps have a RMS error of 3-5 meters in northern Sweden
but also a height bias over forested areas which is approx. less
than half the real tree height in the area. The modelling of forests
show a principle agreement with measured parameters in the images.
Weather conditions greatly influence measurements. Inversion of
measured parameters should be possible with the model and thus
a measure of forest bole volume could be obtained from the images.
Land cover classification using SAR interferometry is outlined
together with how the data could be used. However, better understanding
of how different land classes appear in the images is required.
<P>
Keywords: SAR interferometry, estimation techniques, coherence,
bias, DEM, forest, bole volume, forest modelling, classification,
land classes, shore-fast sea ice displacements

<H1><CENTER><FONT SIZE=5>Program Arctic Ocean - 96, : Remote sensing
and sea ice program. </FONT></CENTER></H1>
<P>
Note: The program represents the aims as planned before the expedition
start. The actual program was determined by the ice situation
and changes in the planned route. 
<H2>Leg 1: Sea ice melt period; program related to meltponds and
general ice properties.</H2>
<P>
Ice properties are recorded together with meteorological information
in the trafficability report. The same observations will take
place on Polarstern and the reports will be co-ordinated. G&ouml;ran
Liljestr&ouml;m is the only representative but he will obtain
help from the Russian ice experts onboard. Visual observations
of area coverage of one year, two year and multi year ice is important.
Of special importance during this leg is the meltpond coverage
and melt pond properties e.g. size distributions.
<P>
 To extend the ship observations video recordings from the helicopter
will be carried out together with ice reconnaissance. Such observations
should be checked during the cruise for consistency with the bridge
observations.
<P>
 With only G&ouml;ran Liljestr&ouml;m in the program field work
has to be concentrated to the cases when stops are taking place
during days with satellite imaging.
<P>
 The melt period extends somewhat into leg 2. It should be noted
that the meltpond coverage is varying between first year (30-50%)
and multiyear ice (20-30%). 
<P>
Embarking: G&ouml;teborg
<H2>Leg 2: Sea ice freeze-up period, program related to the variability
of the ice properties including melting conditions</H2>
<P>
The melt period extends somewhat into leg 2. Melt ponds are of
interest from many points of view including the fact that major
parts of the roughness characterisation of the ice surface is
related to the melt ponds. The melting is also related to radiation
properties and radiation measurements 300-1100 nm will be performed
within snow and ice and in the water beneath the ice, in leads
and meltponds. Possibilities to characterise one year, two year
and multi year ice is generally important.
<P>
 As the variability of the ice is the most interesting aspect,
as the time within the ice is limited to two - three weeks, and
as the program is split between the two ships reducing the effectiveness
in characterising sea ice properties we have asked for a stop
once per day or at least 14 - 15 stops for making field observations
together with helicopeter observations. The helicopter observations
are particularly important together with the longer stops when
more extensive ice information can be obtained. This should be
combined with satellite images and the route should then be related
to the satellite acquisitions.
<P>
 Helicopter observations are performed using scatterometer and
video in order to have observe mesoscale variations. Larger areas
are covered in a zig-zag manner by helicopter making scatterometer
observations (altitude 100 m) followed by separate videofilming
from higher altitude. GPS and time information important for localization.
Photographs from helicopter are also very good complements (time
noted). Notes on ice properties of area important. 
<P>
 The stopping time needs to be 3 - 12 hours depending on the program.
The ice structure and microstructure will be measured (3 hours)
followed by sediment and sediment redistribution observations
(3 hours). Radiation properties can be measured in parallell.
For excavating an ice trench and for optical measurements at different
depth of the ice, for drilling of ice cores (note G&ouml;ran Liljestr&ouml;m
will have equipment for quick drilling of 1.5 m ice cores for
which temperature profiles and salinity can be determined by the
sea ice group) and determining temperature, salinity and DEP (dielectric
profiling of conductance and capacitance at several frequencies
1- 100 kHz) of the ice cores up to 12 hours is necessary. Short
stops will be used for observations adjacent to the ship as well
as observations away from the ship while the ship is moving. Longer
stops are necessary for some of the program elements as well as
for wide area coverage of ice information and helicopter observations.
Areas covered by helicopter scatterometer should also be characterized
by surface observations made by team using skidoos. Surface properties,
snow layer (thickness), aged ice surface (thickness, properties),
roughness characterization (mechanical pin device with a measurment
grid behind + photographs), snow wetness, roughness properties,
snow and ice temperature (particularly when temperature of ice
is close to zero), ice ridge properties (height, width, block
sizes, block roughness on various sizes). Thin ice and occurence
of frost flower important information. Thickness of ice is determined
by means of radio echo soundings using 50 or 400 Mhz along transects
using man-hauled or using skidoo.
<P>
 The ice information also includes 
<P>
 Radio beacons have been placed to localise three areas of ice
with different properties during 1995. Due to the drift pattern
these areas will have drifted to the area where leg 2 starts or
even further north. Revisiting at least one of these areas is
very important, but depending on the most recent location information
from the beacon. (This program point not possible to carry out
as the ice drift was larger than anticipated.)
<P>
 The group has 25 hours of helicopter time available which is
approximately the same time as 1991. Due to the risk for bad flying
conditions we have to agree on a priority list such as (1) revisiting
of one beacon-site, (2) area coverage with helicopter borne scatterometer,
(3) area coverage by video.
<P>
Embarking: Lominosov Ridge
<H2>Leg 1 + 2 Remote sensing</H2>
<P>
The remote sensing program is mainly related to ERS-2 and Radarsat
for which Jan Askne and Hajo Eicken are PI:s for different projects
which we will try to coordinate. ERS-2 needs direct contact with
a ground station which limits the coverage to the first parts
of Leg 1. Radarsat has the capability to store data onboard and
dump it over Canada. The delays in the delivery of data are not
yet quite clear.
<P>
NOAA AVHRR data is of interest to combine with radiation measurements
on the ice and with SAR data. High resolution data will be obtained
at Polarstern, low resolution on Oden.
<P>
Okean data will be received on Polarstern and possibly Oden if
possible. The nominal lifetime of the satellite is already over.
<P>
SSM/I data is planned to be combined with Radarsat data.

<H2>Background<BR>
</H2>
<P>
The satelliteborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) system is a
promising technique for research in hostile environment like the
Arctic, where weather and ice conditions are a real threat to
traditional in situ observations and measurements (cf. Askne 1994).
This technique has also been proven to be useful for ship and
icebreaker operations in ice infested seas (cf. H&aring;kansson
et al. 1995, and Herland &amp; Berglund 1995). Since SAR data
are obtained as an image, the distribution of different types
of ice and open water can be obtained. <BR>
<P>
The gathered expedition data are used for SAR imagery validation,
and evaluation of its usefulness for monitoring of sea ice properties
of importance for climate change. In particular we are interested
in meltpond distribution, sea ice concentrations and sea ice drift.
The results from Arctic-91 expedition shows that ESA satellite
ERS-1 indeed could be used for retrieving some of these sea ice
variables (Sun &amp; Askne 1994 and Pettersson et al. 1996). However,
the ERS-1 SAR imagery has a much smaller geographic coverage than
the present Radarsat SAR imagery (100*100 km<FONT SIZE=1>2</FONT>
compared to 500*500 km<FONT SIZE=1>2</FONT>) and in addition Radarsat
has a much larger coverage towards the high latitudes (up to about
88&#176; N) than ERS-1 and -2. Since little is known about the
ice distribution and its seasonal variability at high latitudes,
it is possible with this technique to improve our knowledge and
contribute with bits and pieces to the water and energy exchange
between the ocean and the atmosphere in the Arctic area. Processes
which are critical in climate and environmentally related research
activities.
<H2>Work at Oden and on the ice<BR>
</H2>
<P>
The radar emits energy in the microwave range of the spectrum,
for example the Canadian satellite Radarsat is operating at the
frequency of 5.3 GHz, at different angles to the ground. In this
context an important task of the expedition was to get information
of the sea ice conditions for comparison with the image data.
We concentrated our efforts on snow coverage, density, grain size,
temperature, wetness and thickness as well as the ice thickness,
roughness, temperature, salinity, porosity, density and dielectric
properties. In addition it is important to have information on
ridges, leads, meltponds, first-year and multi-year ice distributions.
<P>
Hence, the aim of our project was to gather information of snow
and ice conditions, distribution of ice and open water and of
ice-types, during times when the satellite passed over our observation
area. A helicopterborne video camera connected to a GPS was used
to observe the local scale of the sea ice variability. Helicopter
flights in this part of the world are extremely weather dependent
since the visibility changes rapidly and there is often risk for
icing during high moisture content at air temperatures below 0&#176;
C. During the second leg of the cruise the air temperature never
exceed 0&#176; C and the moisture was almost always around 80
to 90 %. When the cloud cover disappeared, the outgoing thermal
radiation often cooled the atmosphere close to the ground and
the moist turned into fog. Despite the weather conditions we managed
to get 4 stations covered with measurements from the helicopter.
<BR>
<P>
In addition, tests were performed with a skidoo mounted radar,
determining the backscatter from layers where the dielectric properties
of the ice varied rapidly. Large backscatter is generally obtained
from the interface between ice and water. These radar data are
compared with actual observations of the ice thickness, using
a machine driven drill. In general the accuracy of the radar is
&#177; 0.20 meters.<BR>
<P>
A scatterometer mounted on the helicopter was used to determine
the backscatter from different ice-types and water. This information
is of importance for the interpretation of SAR imagery, as a complement
to the calculated backscatter, using a model based on the data
obtained from the ground measurements.<BR>
<P>
Also the sun radiation within the ice was measured. A larger hole
was sawed into the ice and from the side a small horizontal hole
was drilled. A radians meter was put into this hole, from which
the sun radiation, coming through the snow and the ice above it,
was observed. These data will be used to increase the knowledge
of the energy flux parameterisation in snow and ice, which are
important for climate models. Another additional subproject of
the group was to investigate the sediment content in the sea ice.
A presentation of this project will be given elsewhere.<BR>
<H2>Some preliminary results<BR>
</H2>
<P>
In all we were able to cover 12 ice stations. The average snow
thickness varied from 8 to 56 cm, with the thin snow cover (8
to 15 cm) obtained at 85&#176; N 10&#176; E and southward to the
marginal ice zone. The snow can be classified into four different
types, based on density and grain size; a/ new snow with high
void content and small grain size, b/ new but windpacked snow
with relatively low void content and slightly larger grain size,
c/ granular snow particles with low void content and d/ highly
granular snow-ice particles with medium void content loosely bonded
to each other. Statistics shows there are a relation between mean
and standard deviation of snow thickness. These data can be used
to estimate the local average snow cover thickness, information
necessary for thermodynamic modelling and heat exchange between
the water-ice-atmosphere system and for interpretation of SAR
imagery. <BR>
<P>
In the eastern high Arctic there were no signs that a summer melt
has taken place, since relatively high salinity was found in the
surface parts of the second-year ice cores, investigated along
the 85&#176; N latitude between 149 and 160&#176; E. On the other
hand, in areas closer to the ice edge i.e. south of 85&#176; N
along 10&#176; E had experienced melting conditions. A conclusion
based on the vast amount of frozen melt ponds found in this part
of the Arctic. Typically the ponds were covered with 10 to 20
cm of fresh ice above a layer of fresh water on multi-year ice.
<BR>
<BR>
The very first preliminary analysis of a RADARSAT image from September
1 indicate that the ice concentration is on average 85 % in that
particular area, which is close in magnitude to the estimate found
from helicopter video measurements, cf Figure 1. At first glance
it may appear unlikely with such a relatively low ice concentration,
but note that the i/b Oden managed well at these latitudes, since
ice breaking could be avoided to a great extent due to the presence
of leads and openings.<BR>

<H2>Acknowledgements<BR>
</H2>
<P>
The whole group thanks the helicopter and the deck crew on i/b
Oden for assistance with equipment and their patience with us
during loading and unloading at each ice station. In particular
we thank Jan-Erik Johansson for transports on the ice and polarbear
watching during times when the ice party mainly was occupied with
snow and ice sampling. We are also grateful to the Swedish Space
Board and the Swedish Maritime Administration for funding, as
well as ESA and RADARSAT for satellite images as part of announcement
of opportunity projects.<BR>

<CENTER><H3>THE MAKING OF A PSYCHOANALYST</H3></CENTER>
  

 


<P>WHO QUALIFIES? It is often said that the most talented analysts started out with at least one crazy parent who was not "cured" by the youngster's best efforts to understand and respond. NPAP's Charter permits persons to enter psychoanalytic training if they have earned at least a Master's degree in a field of human relations. Candidates have come to NPAP from the fields of religion, law, literature, the arts, education, philosophy and other branches of the humanities as well as the fields of nursing, social work, psychology and psychiatry. </P>

<P>WHAT HAPPENS IN THIS SPECIAL TRAINING? Usually the candidate's whole life changes. The study of psychoanalysis is not only about helping others. Its insights have a way of becoming intensely personal for all who undertake the 4 components of training. </P>

<UL>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>	<B>The Curriculum</B> consists of 26 courses focused on understanding how theory can be applied to actually working with patients 
          one-to-one. Candidates receive a thorough grounding in 
          Classical Psychoanalysis as well as contemporary thinking in 
          the areas of Psychoanalytic Ego Psychology, Object Relations, 
          and Self Psychology. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>	<B>The Training Analysis</B> is a unique feature of an analyst's 
          preparation. No psychoanalyst is allowed to treat others without 
          first undergoing personal analysis. Otherwise,  
	even the brightest of students still would have 
          no foundation for understanding what patients are truly 
          saying and would have no way to recognize when their own 
          personality dynamics were limiting or interfering with their 
          work. Training Analysis is traditionally the most important 
          aspect of learning to understand the human mind and expand 
          the analyst's talents in responding to others.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>	<B>Clinical experience</B> consists of treating patients with a 
          variety of diagnoses and levels of functioning while the 
          candidate is in supervision. After completing the first phase 
          of training, candidates may affiliate with NPAP's referral 
          service, known as the <A HREF="reik.htm">THEODOR REIK CONSULTATION CENTER</A>. TRCC 
          is not a clinic and does not subject candidates or patients 
          to an institutional atmosphere. Rather,  
          TRCC's patients are treated in the candidate's own private
office. 
          Candidates just beginning a private practice may rent space 
          in the NPAP building at affordable rates. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>	<B>Control Analysis</B> refers to the intensive experience of 
          meeting weekly with a supervisor to focus on the candidate's 
          treatment of a single patient in psychoanalysis. This makes 
          possible a depth of understanding and responding that could 
          never come about any other way. Candidates conduct at least 
          two such treatments under different supervisors, lasting at 
          least 1 year for one patient and 2 years for the other. </BLOCKQUOTE>
</UL>


<P>IS TRAINING EXPENSIVE?  Courses are $200 for a 12-week session ($250 for an <A HREF="audit.htm">auditor</A>). This is much less expensive than virtually any other type of graduate training.  The more expensive part is the Training Analysis which is why candidates may request a list of NPAP Members willing to conduct a
low-fee Training Analysis. When all is said and done, analysis enhances
personal life as well as 
professional competence.   </P>

     <P><BLOCKQUOTE>NPAP's referral service, the Theodor Reik Consultation Center, has met community needs for low cost psychotherapy and psychoanalysis for over 40 years.  TRCC is not a clinic.  More than 250 therapists see TRCC's patients in their own offices, affording each patient privacy and confidentiality. Therapists do not "sign up" with TRCC.  Each must be invited to participate after a committee interview and evaluation of the therapist's training, understanding and sensitivity.  In this way TRCC ensures that its therapists are warm, caring people-many trained in couples therapy, family and group therapy as well as individual treatment. Many therapists are multi-lingual so that foreign languages may not be a barrier.  We believe that problems which may seem insurmountable can be explored and often resolved with the help of a therapist who understands and appreciates each individual's uniqueness, inner resources, and feelings.</BLOCKQUOTE></P>
 

<P><BLOCKQUOTE>This service to the community is non-profit in the truest sense: TRCC's Director and Executive Committee are elected by the Membership of the Institute to serve as volunteers.  No hidden owners or administrators benefit financially from the patient-therapist relationship. </BLOCKQUOTE></P>

<P><BLOCKQUOTE>The fee for treatment is based on the ability to pay and starts at $15 per session. The Intake Interview fee is $25. Although TRCC's administrative office is located in Manhattan, our therapists are located throughout the Tri-State area (New York, Connecticut, New Jersey) and beyond.  </BLOCKQUOTE></P>

<CENTER><H3>FAQ ABOUT PSYCHOTHERAPY AND PSYCHOANALYSIS </H3></CENTER>

<B>1.  How do I know if I should begin psychotherapy?  </B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>When a person is asking this question seriously, then psychotherapy is usually a good idea. Waiting for a crisis or panic is not necessary. Therapy is most productive when a person realizes that personal difficulties are not going to change by repeating the usual methods. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>2.  What if I have been told to go into therapy?</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>If a boss or spouse has insisted that you begin therapy, you may be angry and think about what you need to do to placate others and end your treatment. After you get past this initial focus, you may find therapy one of the most important experiences of your life. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>3.  Does therapy take a long time?</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Often people experience a burst of growth right at the start, along with a realization that they are still holding on to thoughts or feelings that cannot be explored as easily as they might have wished. This struggle toward the goal of telling the whole story, not just part, may increase time in therapy as it increases growth. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>4.  If I go more often, does this mean I am sicker?</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>No, often the opposite is true.  People who are basically healthy but distressed by problems in living can make the best use of two or three sessions a week. They realize that a single session tends to limit them to talking about weekly events, whereas two or three sessions permit genuine exploration of important ideas and feelings. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>5.  What are the differences between psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, psychotherapists, and  psychoanalysts?</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>While most of these practitioners have probably had some training in basic counseling methods, the differences between them are crucial and affect the perspective from which you as the patient will be treated.  <BR><BR>
 
A <B>psychiatrist</B> is a physician and has been uniquely trained in prescribing psychotropic medications. <BR>

A <B>psychologist</B> has a Ph.D. or Psy.D. degree and is uniquely trained in psychological testing and research.  <BR>

A <B>social worker</B> has an M.S.W. degree and is uniquely trained in the workings of social service programs and psychosocial counseling. <BR> 

In most states,the term <B>psychotherapist</B> can be used by anyone, with or without training and credentials. <BR>

A <B>psychoanalyst</B> has the most comprehensive training of all, since this specialized training cannot even begin until the person has already earned a postgraduate degree. A certified psychoanalyst has spent an extra 8-10 years focusing on how to work with people one-to-one. Psychoanalysis is the only profession in which certification requires the analyst to go through personal treatment, averaging 5-10 years, so that the analyst will not confuse the analyst's personal issues with the patient's. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>6.  Even when I know the differences in academic degrees, how can I be sure that my therapist's training is relevant and certified?</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Strange as it seems, you can't really be sure unless you investigate, since most states do not pay any attention to whether or not a therapist has been through personal analysis and completed a training program in psychoanalysis.  A true psychoanalyst will have a certificate from a recognized institute and will be able to point you to a national Directory of Psychoanalysts where this person's name is listed.  </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>7.  When it comes to my own therapy sessions, what difference does training in psychoanalysis really make? </B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Your psychoanalyst's approach to therapy will be distinctive. Virtually all other branches of the mental health field teach their professionals to function as "experts," with goals, ideas or plans that the patient is supposed to learn to go along with. Psychoanalysts consider this approach useless and even harmful, since it falsely implies that the patient is ignorant or wrong and that the therapist knows better.  A psychoanalyst's approach is based on a sophisticated listening process that can identify previously unknown obstacles to growth.  Resolving these obstacles frees the person's own talents in choosing a personal pathway to solving problems. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>8.  Don't psychoanalysts spend a lot of time talking about childhood?</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Psychoanalysts have no special topics the patient is supposed to discuss. Patients often bring up childhood memories and fantasies as psychoanalysis enables the mind to expand.  Life themes that previously seemed disconnected are understood in a new light. This integration of past and present is part of the holistic growth resulting from  psychoanalysis. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>9.  What if I have health insurance for psychotherapy?</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Many analysts are willing to cooperate with insurance companies, but even though you pay premiums year after year, you might be surprised to find that your policy strictly limits benefits for psychotherapy. A summer 1996 issue of The National Psychologist reported that a whopping 99% of the consumers who actually examined their HMO's policies and procedures are dissatisfied. Consumers found that their company expected a detailed written report about confidential information, that they are only covered for a few sessions, that the company wanted them to take pills, or that they could not choose the best therapist because the company required them to see someone who had a financial agreement on the side that they are not allowed to know about. When your own life and future is at stake, beware of choosing the path that looks cheapest at first glance. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>10.  Does psychoanalysis curtail creativity?</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Most people worried about losing creativity in therapy are inwardly aware that they long for more productive ways to harness their creativity and bring it to light. In psychoanalytic therapy a person's creativity is likely to expand as inner wishes to be     more creative have a chance to come to fruition in the person's actions. Creativity actually increases. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>11.  Why does Managed Care try to avoid psychoanalysts?</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Because managed care makes a profit by paying out as little money as possible for treatment. Most managed care operations restrict treatment to a specific topic (or diagnosis) that must be written down and sent to the company.  Managed care limits the number of sessions, interferes with confidentiality and restricts the therapists who work for the company. Psychoanalysts insist that only the patient has the right to set the agenda for therapy, and that only the patient should have the freedom to shorten or expand this agenda according to personal needs. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>12.  Is psychoanalysis expensive?</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Most psychoanalysts have a sliding fee scale, or set aside part of their time for patients who can only afford a lower fee.  Many analysts also have a network of colleagues who can help find the right analyst for someone in financial need. For nearly 100 years this commitment to patient needs has made psychoanalytic therapy available and affordable.  As Freud once remarked, "nothing is as expensive as illness, or ignorance". </BLOCKQUOTE>


<B>13. Is treatment confidential? </B>
 
<BLOCKQUOTE>If you are seeing a certified psychoanalyst - and not using Managed Care - the answer is absolutely YES.  However, under Managed Care, no one can guarantee your privacy as information collected about you as a patient is stored in the company's computer, and may possibly be shared with other companies or agencies.</BLOCKQUOTE> 
 


<B>14. How should I go about choosing a therapist?</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Two rules are fundamental: (a) the person you choose should have advanced, specialized training in psychotherapy (not just an academic degree or license), and (b) you should not rely on an insurance company's list of therapists. Although it is sometimes helpful to seek a recommendation, you must always rely on your own judgment when it comes to the "chemistry" in the room.  Avoid basing your choice merely on a convenient location, surface similarities between you and a therapist, or even the therapist's gender; chemistry matters most. At the <A HREF="reik.htm">THEODOR REIK CONSULTATION CENTER</A>, nearly 250 therapists in private practice in the New York-Connecticut-New Jersey region have met TRCC's advanced training standards. If no one at TRCC is just right, the Intake Director will know who to recommend instead.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><BR>
<B>In recent times, radical critiques of the human sciences' traditional,
widely and uncritically accepted basic assumptions (about persons, knowledge,
truth, validation, internal and external reality, and the like) have converged
on a consensus that seriously calls these assumptions into question, seeing
them as deeply flawed. <BR>
<BR>
These challenged assumptions also operate ubiquitously within psychoanalysis,
and the principal premise of this presentation is that they also, at bottom,
are responsible for the many familiar theoretical, conceptual, methodological
and clinical difficulties that perennially plague psychoanalysis. <BR>
<BR>
In support of this premise, first the radical critiques of general psychology
will be outlined and considered Next. their relevance specifically for
psychoanalysis will be discussed, with particular attention to the linkages
that are widely thought to exist between psychoanalytic theory and its
clinical practice. Finally, tentative recommendations for future directions
will be offered, including an introduction to the concept of &quot;psychoanalytic
praxis.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Louis S. Berger's professional life spans the fields of electrical engineering
(B. S.), physics (M. S. ), <BR>
music (M. M. ), and clinical psychology (Ph.D. ). Formerly a cellist with
the Boston Symphony, on the faculty of the Department of Psychiatry and
Behavioral Sciences, University of Louisville School of Medicine, he is
now Staff Psychologist at Southwest Research Institute, San Antonio, Texas.
and teaches seminars in the Department of Psychiatry, University of Texas
Health Science Center at San Antonio. Dr Berger is the author of <I>Introductory
Statistics: A New Approach for the Behavioral Sciences</I> (1981). <I>Psychoanalytic
Theory and Clinical Relevance: What Makes a Theory Consequential for Practice?
</I>(Analytic Press, 1985), and<I> Substance Abuse as Symptom: A Psychoanalytic
Critique of Treatment Approaches and the Cultural Beliefs that Sustain
Them</I> (Analytic Press, 1991), and numerous book reviews and articles.</B><BR>

<CENTER><H3>AUDITING COURSES AT NPAP</H3></CENTER>
 

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>An <I>auditor</I> is a professional who has an interest in studying psychoanalytic
theory but does not wish to pursue training as a psychoanalyst.  An auditor
may take one course each term from among the list of required 600 level
courses.  Unless the number of auditors is sufficient for the Faculty and
Curriculum Committee to schedule a separate class, auditors are admitted
into regularly scheduled courses. </FONT>  
 
<P><BLOCKQUOTE><B>Admission as an auditor:</B>  An auditor must have at least a Master's degree. Interested persons complete an application form available from the NPAP office and are then invited for an enrollment interview.</BLOCKQUOTE> 

<P><BLOCKQUOTE><B>Tuition and Fees:</B>  Tuition is $250 for each 12-session course taken at
the 600 level.  In addition to the $50 application fee, auditors pay a
registration fee of $25 per term; a yearly $10 library fee; a $30 fee for a
subscription to The Psychoanalytic Review; a $10 fee for a subscription to
the NPAP News and Reviews; and $20 for membership in the candidate association, the Members-in-Training-Organization (MITO).</BLOCKQUOTE>   
 
<P><BLOCKQUOTE><B>Options:</B> Auditors complete all reading assignments and participate in
general class discussions with no more than 2 absences.  They may choose
whether or not to make formal oral presentations (where applicable) or
complete written assignments.  An auditor who completes all course
requirements and receives an acceptable faculty evaluation will receive
full credit for this course if admitted later into the training program. </BLOCKQUOTE>  
<P><BLOCKQUOTE><B>Evaluations:</B>  Auditors submit evaluations of their experiences in each
course to the Faculty and Curriculum Committee.  Instructors evaluate
auditors according to the extent of each auditor's self-chosen immersion in
course requirements. </BLOCKQUOTE>
 
<P><BLOCKQUOTE><B>Limitations:</B>  Because of the complex nature of the Institute's training
aims for all its candidates, auditors implicitly understand and accept that
the Training Committee reserves the right to discontinue an auditor's
participation at any time.  An auditor who has completed all courses at the
Enrollment level must then either leave the Institute or apply for full
status as a Member-in-Training. </BLOCKQUOTE>
 

<BR>
<BR>



<P><I>The Institute is chartered under the Education Law of the State of New York by the Board of Regents of the University of the State of New York.  Absolute Charter from the New York State Board of Regents was granted on February 24, 1967.</I> </P>

<H2>About the AIVC</H2>

<P>
Ventilation and air infiltration into buildings represent a substantial
energy demand which can account for between 25% to over 50% of
a building's total space heating (or cooling) needs. Unnecessary
or excessive air change can therefore have an important impact
on global energy use. On the other hand insufficient ventilation
may result in poor indoor air quality and consequential health
problems.
<P>
Designing for optimum ventilation performance is hence a vital
part of building design. This task is made especially difficult,
however, by the complexities of airflow behaviour, climatic influences,
occupancy patterns and pollutant emission characteristics.
<P>
In recognition of the significant impact of ventilation on energy
use, combined with concerns over indoor air quality, the <A HREF="http://www.iea.org/" >International Energy Agency  
</A>(IEA) inaugurated the Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centre
in 1979. The role of the centre is to provide technical support
to those involved in the research and development of ventilation
technology as well as to ensure the widest dissemination of information
on related energy and air quality issues.
<P>
The AIVC fulfils its objectives by providing a range of services
and facilities which include:
<H2><A NAME="Information">Information</A> Services</H2>

<P>
The Centre provides a comprehensive information service, the hub
of which is its bibliographic database - <A href="airbase.html" >AIRBASE  
</A>. This contains abstracts of several thousand specialist articles
related to ventilation and associated issues. AIRBASE is regularly
updated and may be accessed via the Centre or may be obtained
in machine readable form for operation on IBM PC compatible computers.
The majority of items referenced in AIRBASE are available from
the AIVC's international library service (subject to copyright
restrictions).
<H2>Technical <A NAME="Analysis">Analysis</A></H2>

<P>
The AIVC undertakes its own technical programme which is focused
on the analysis and interpretation of international research.
Current activities include:
<UL>
<LI>the development of a <A href="numdb.html" >Numerical Database  
</A>for design and evaluation applications,
<LI>the review of ventilation strategies for commercial and domestic
environments,
<LI>the evaluation of calculation and measurement procedures for
predicting airflow and air change rates,
<LI>reviewing the energy and environmental impact of building
ventilation, and
<LI>assessing air change and ventilation efficiency applications.
</UL>

<H2>Technical <A NAME="Interchange">Interchange</A></H2>

<P>
An important task of the Centre is to ensure the widest possible
dissemination of information. In fulfilling this task it publishes
many <A href="reports.html" >technical reports  </A>and co-ordinates
and publishes the results of related IEA activities. In addition,
the AIVC organises regular conferences and specialist workshops.
It also publishes &quot;<A HREF="elecair.html" >Air Infiltration Review  
</A>(AIR)&quot; - a quarterly journal of information, news and
short technical items. &quot;Air Infiltration Review&quot; is
currently circulated to over 40 countries. In addition, as part
of its dissemination activity, the AIVC carries out regular surveys
of world-wide research into building ventilation.
<H2>Annual <A NAME="Conference">Conference</A></H2>

<P>
The 18th AIVC Conference &quot;<B>Ventilation and Cooling&quot;
</B>is open to participants from all countries* in the <A HREF="http://www.ecbcs.org/" >IEA ECBCS  
</A>Implementing Agreement. Please see the <A HREF="conf.html" >18th AIVC Conference Announcement

<H3>IEA Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centre</H3>

<H1><B>AIRBASE</B> Bibliographic Database</H1>
<HR>

<P>
<B>AIRBASE</B> is the Bibliographic Database of the International
Energy Agency's Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centre. It contains
abstracts of articles and publications related to energy efficient
ventilation. Topics include:
<UL>
<LI>ventilation strategies,
<LI>design and retrofit methods,
<LI>calculation techniques,
<LI>standards and regulations,
<LI>measurement methods,
<LI>indoor air quality and energy implications.
</UL>

<P>
Entries are based on articles and reports published in journals,
internal publications and research reports, produced both by university
departments and by building research institutions throughout the
world.
<P>
<B>AIRBASE</B> has grown and evolved over many years. It is now
available on floppy disk or <A HREF="cdrom.html" >CD-ROM </A>
to organisations in <A href="countries.html" >participating countries  
</A>of the AIVC. It runs on IBM-compatible Personal Computers
under either of the DOS or MS Windows environments.
<P>
Based on easy-to-use IDEALIST software, from Blackwell Scientific
Publications, <B>AIRBASE</B> is extremely user-friendly. It allows
access to relevant bibliographic information within minutes. It
is an essential aid for anyone wishing to undertake ventilation
research and design.
<P>
Features of <B>AIRBASE</B> include <EM>free text</EM> searching,
combined with search narrowing or widening. It is also possible
to search individual fields, such as <EM>keywords</EM> or <EM>authors
</EM>.<BR>

<P>
For example, if you were to search for 'radon' or 'energy conservation',
<B>AIRBASE</B> would then put together a list of abstracts which
concern either of those topics. Full instructions for the extremely
straightforward <B>AIRBASE</B> are included in the documentation
accompanying the product.
<P>
<B>AIRBASE</B> requires at least 20 MB of available hard-disk
space, DOS 3.1 or above and an INTEL 286 processor or better.
This means that it should work on almost any of the common IBM
clones. It will also work well on portable PCs, making it ideal
for mobile use.
<P>
<B>AIRBASE</B> is updated on a regular basis, every three months.
Copies of all abstracted publications are available through the
International library service of the <A href="address.html" >AIVC  
</A>.
<P>
To receive more information about <B>AIRBASE</B> please fill in
<A href="/cgi-bin/aivc/airform.pl" >this  </A>order form. Alternatively,
download a <A href="sample.zip" >free demo version  </A>(contains
only a small subset of the records). This version works on PCs
with Windows 3.1 or later. The cost is &#163;150 UK pounds (plus
UK Value Added Tax (VAT) at 17.5%, where applicable). Available
to participants only.

ABSTRACT The impact of ventilation on energy use can be considerable.
Total building energy use is variously estimated to account for
30% of all energy consumed inInternational Energy Agency countries.
Of this, as much as 50% can be associated with ventilation and
air infiltration. As living standards throughout the world improve,
it may be expected that building occupants will demand ever increasing
standards of comfort. This will inevitably result in increased
demand on building energy use and further heighten concerns over
global pollution.Much can be achieved to reduce energy demand
by improvingenergy efficiency. However, as the thermal performance
of buildings improves, ventilation will become the dominant source
of building energy loss. Unfortunately, reducing ventilation as
a means to minimise energy demand, hasbecome inextricably linked
to problems associated with unhealthy buildings. Ventilation is
thus an essential parameter in both energy and indoor air quality
control. The purpose of this report is to assess future ventilation
research and development needs. An objective has been toidentify
the prime objectives and tasks needed to secure energy efficient
ventilation without detriment to indoor air quality.

ABSTRACT The report begins by reviewing some basic questions about
ventilation efficiency. The subject is then presented in greater
detail and finally an example of the prediction of ventilation
efficiency in an office enclosure is given. Emphasis is given
to the range of applicability and limitations of ventilation efficiency
methods.

ABSTRACT A fundamental objective of this report is to investigate
the techniques used in the design and research fields for the
evaluation of thermal and air flow simulations. The scope is restricted
to the whole building rather than flow and heat transfer within
individual structural elements (e.g. cavity walls). Considerable
developments are taking place in the field of air flow and thermal
simulation. Rather than present an in-depth study of these developments,
this report concentrates on the rather more general aspects of
the combined simulation.

ABSTRACT The infiltration data set covers December 1990 to October
1991 from Reference Unit #5 at the Alberta Home Heating Research
Faciligy (AHHRF) with a total of 6063 hours of data. The facility
is made up of six permanent testhouses, five of which are built
to residential wood frame construction standards with a sixth
house of masonry construction. The six unoccupied test houses
have been continuously monitored since 1980 for building envelope
energy losses and ventilation rates.

ABSTRACT The aim of this study is to examine common ventilation
and air conditioning systems and strategies for both domestic
and commercial buildings in the member countries of the AIVC.
To help identify common systems, a literature search was conducted
and the system descriptions of two professional institutions and
one commercial supplier were examined. This led to the establishment
of a common classification of ventilation and air conditioning
systems.

ABSTRACT The purpose of this review of current airtightness and
ventilation rate standards is to provide a reference document
to all those involved in ventilation and building research. This
review summarises available airtightness and minimum ventilation
rate requirements in the member countries of the Air Infiltration
and Ventilation Centre. It also examines a number of indoor air
quality standards. Where uniformity exists in the way the standards
are expressed some analysis has also been included. The data contained
in this report are also available in database format.

ABSTRACT The Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centre's Numerical
Database has been developed in response to a need to establish
a core of numerical data suitable for design purposes and model
validation. It has also been developed to provide a focus for
data derived from related International Energy Agency projects.
Source information is contained within a computerised database
from which direct searching for specific material is possible.
The purpose of this report is to present an ansalysis of key database
material which may be used for design purposes.Data have been
derived from as wide a range of sources as possible. Many organisations
have contributed to the data presented. By combining information
from these many sorces, it has been possible to consider a far
wider range of operating conditions than would be possible by
using the results from a single set of measurements. This report
and analysis is presented in three sections: component leakage
data; whole building leakage data; wind pressure evaluation.

ABSTRACT Discusses the issues which influence the performance
of heat recovery devices within typical building applications.
It is intended to cover the three main types if devices installed
in ventilation systems in residential and commercial buildings,
which are run-around coils, plate heat exchangers and thermal
wheels (rotary regenerators). Other systems such as heat pipes
are also described briefly. The successful implementation of air
to air heat recovery depends on factors such as careful equipment
selection, proper integration of equipment into the ventilation
system, good commissioning, proper maintenance and operation,
and building characteristics, such as airtightness. One section
gives information to assist the designer and building operator
to understand some of the factors that influence the performance
of heat recovery systems, highlighting some of the key points
that have emerged from the analysis of existing information, detailed
simulation work and site measurements.

ABSTRACT The objectives of this work are: first to determine the
theoretical energy requirements per constant mien unit of outdoor
air used for ventilation for a number of different climates and
locations in North America and Europe; and secondly to determine
the variation of this annual ventilation heating and cooling energy
requirements due to the set points for temperature and humidity.
The energy impact and/or trade-offs involved between bringing
in outdoor air for indoor air pollution reduction and the energy
required to condition this sir are investigated in this report.
Long-term hourly weather data from several European and American
locations were analysed to determine the average conditions of
air over the period of record of the data. These data were then
analysed to determine the psychometric process theoretical heating,
cooling and moisture removal energy requirements for a constant
mass of airflow per hour (MJ.h/kg). Summary weather data are also
provided if it is desired to determine the additional effects
of equipment and design. It was found that a significant amount
of energy is required to condition air which is used for ventilation.
The annual energy required per kg/hr of airflow varies from 22.1
MJ.h/kg for Los Angeles to 102.5 MJ.h/kg for Omaha. In Europe
the range was from 45.6 MJ.h/kg for Nice to 101.1 MJ.h/kg for
Saint-Hubert. In Europe most of the energy was used to heat the
air to the desired set point. In American there were significant
amounts of both heating and cooling required. Much of the variation
was due to the amount of moisture in the air which had to be removed
in air conditioning. In situation where air conditioning is used,
a significant amount of this energy is used in dehumidifying the
air. For example, in Miami 86% of the energy is used for moisture
removal. It was found that the energy used was highly sensitive
to the cooling and relative humidity set points.

Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centre</H3>
<HR>

<H1>A Guide to Energy Efficient Ventilation</H1>
<HR>

<H3>by Martin W Liddament, Head of the AIVC</H3>

<P>
The purpose of the AIVC's new guide to ventilation is to review
ventilation in the context of achieving energy efficiency and
good indoor air quality. It is primarily concerned with providing
an introduction to the topic and encapsulates the knowledge and
experience derived from experts in all the participating countries
of the Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centre. Numerical descriptions
have been kept to a minimum, while emphasis is placed on describing
ventilation and the decision making involved in selecting and
planning for ventilation. By understanding this Guide, it is hoped
that the reader will be able to make fundamental judgements about
how much ventilation should be provided and how this should be
accomplished for optimum cost and energy efficiency.
<P>
This guide is specifically aimed at the policy maker, architect,
building services engineer, designer and building owners and occupiers
who require a background knowledge to ventilation.

Structured in twelve chapters the first considers the role of
ventilation. It looks at the need for ventilation to meet metabolic
needs (oxygen and odour control), the minimum acceptable ventilation
rate and at additional requirements to meet the (polluting) activities
of occupants (e.g. smoking, cooking, unvented clothes drying etc.).
<P>
It is argued that too often it falls upon ventilation to accomplish
tasks for which it is not intended.

<P>
Chapter 2 reviews indoor air quality. Good indoor air quality
may be defined as air which is free of pollutants that cause irritation,
discomfort or ill health to occupants. Thermal conditions and
relative humidity also influence comfort and health. A poor indoor
environment can manifest itself as a 'sick' building in which
some occupants experience mild illness symptoms during periods
of occupancy. More serious pollutant problems may result in long
term and permanent ill-health effects. Since much time is spent
inside buildings, considerable effort has focused on methods to
achieve an optimum indoor environment, with particular emphasis
on health, odour control, thermal comfort and energy efficiency.

<P>
<I>Aspects of Indoor Air Quality are discussed with particular
emphasis on providing an overview of indoor air quality in relation
to:</I>

Above all a coordinated approach is needed to secure good IAQ

<P>
Aspects of energy impact are outlined in Chapter 3. A considerable
proportion of the energy consumed in buildings is lost by ventilation
and air infiltration. This has important implications both at
the consumer level, where the cost must normally be met, and at
the strategic level, where it contributes to primary energy need
and environmental pollution. Since ventilation is so closely linked
to concern about indoor air quality, there is the further problem
of identifying how much ventilation is needed to provide for a
healthy indoor environment.
<P>
Since it is difficult to assess the energy impact of ventilation,
the context of air change in relation to energy use is often undefined.
As a consequence, no adequate datum exists from which strategic
planning for improving the energy efficiency of ventilation can
be developed. This difficulty stems from the enormous complexity
of the task, which needs to accommodate wide variations in factors
such as climate, building air tightness, occupancy patterns and
approaches to ventilation. Efforts to overcome these difficulties
are progressing and an attempt is made in Chapter 3 to outline
the results of present progress.<A NAME="ch4"></A>
<P>
Chapter 4 focuses on ventilation design criteria. A ventilation
system must be designed to satisfy the required demand. In meeting
this need it is necessary to consider a wide range of criteria,
varying from meeting the needs of Building Regulations to planning
for maintenance and replacement (Figure 2). It is also necessary
to integrate the ventilation system itself into the overall design
of the building, especially in relation to air tightness, room
partitioning and accessibility.
<P>
Since such a wide range of parameters is involved, there is rarely
a unique solution to a particular ventilation design. Instead
the designer must base a judgement on the individual needs of
each building. Ultimately a robust solution is needed which ensures
the health and comfort of occupants. Ventilation needs must be
based on criteria that can be established at the design stage
of a building. To return afterwards in an attempt to mitigate
problems as they arise may lead to considerable expense and failure.

<P>

<IMG SRC="gtov_f3.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM" >

<P>
<I>Design Criteria are subjected to many parameters</I><A NAME="ch5">
</A>
<P>
Strategies for ventilation are reviewed in Chapter 5. A wide range
of systems and techniques is available to meet the needs of ventilation
with each having its own set of advantages, disadvantages and
applications. Sometimes choice is dictated by local climate conditions
or building type. Frequently, price competitiveness and an unwillingness
to deviate from the minimum specification of relevant Building
Regulations or Codes of Practice can further restrict choice and
also limit the opportunity for innovation. To justify a complex
strategy, it is usually necessary to demonstrate advantages in
terms of improved indoor climate, reduced energy demand and acceptable
'payback' periods. Strategies reviewed cover both natural and
mechanical systems.<A NAME="ch6"></A>
<P>
Chapter 6 looks at the potential for ventilation heat recovery.
Considerable energy is lost from a building through the departing
air stream. When air change is dominated by infiltration, little
can be done to re-capture this energy. On the other hand, if exhaust
air is centrally collected, a variety of methods for recovering
or recycling the waste heat become possible. In view of the scale
of ventilation energy loss, considerable effort has been devoted
to the design and development of ventilation air heat recovery
systems.
<P>
While the heat recovery process can be shown to be extremely efficient,
benefits must always be equated against the (primary) energy needed
to drive the process and capital and maintenance costs. Various
hidden losses such as air infiltration must also be thoroughly
understood.<A NAME="ch7"></A>
<P>
Ventilation and cooling is reviewed in Chapter 7. Cooling is needed
when the indoor environment becomes excessively hot or humid.
This may occur as a result of high outdoor temperatures or as
a consequence of excessive solar or internal heat gains. High
internal gain is particularly a problem in large non-domestic
buildings.
<P>
When the need for cooling is dictated by internal heat gains rather
than outside temperature and humidity, much can be accomplished
to reduce the need for or eliminate altogether active cooling
systems. Solutions depend on climate but include cooling by ventilation
(passive cooling), designing for reduced solar gains, the use
of thermal mass and restricting internal heat loads.<A NAME="ch8">
</A>
<P>
The role of filtration to clean ventilation air is explored in
Chapter 8. Filtration is a method by which particulates and, sometimes,
gaseous pollutants may be removed from the air. Pollutants are
intercepted by a filter while allowing clean air to pass through.
This method of air cleaning is especially necessary when high
concentrations of particulates are present or when the source
of pollutant is derived from outside the building. Potential benefits
can include improved air quality, reduced dependence on ventilation
and improved energy efficiency. Filtration is not a substitute
for the ventilation needed to meet the metabolic requirements
of occupants.<A NAME="ch9"></A>
<P>
Ventilation Efficiency and the process of air mixing is outlined
in Chapter 9. Indices of ventilation efficiency characterise the
mixing behaviour of air and the distribution of pollutant within
a space. These two aspects may be subdivided into indices of air
change efficiency and pollutant removal effectiveness respectively.
Ventilation efficiency is based on an evaluation of the 'age',
of air and on the concentration distribution of pollutant within
the air. Some indices are based on room averaged values, while
others refer to specific points or locations. This has important
consequences because while room values provide some guidance to
the overall performance of a ventilation system, point values
indicate regions where localised poor ventilation might occur.
<A NAME="ch10"></A>
<P>
Chapter 10 looks at maintenance issues. Maintenance is needed
to ensure the reliability of the ventilation system and to secure
the economic operation of the ventilation plant. Evidence suggests,
however, that maintenance is often inadequate and that the need
for maintenance may even be ignored in the course of building
design. Typical problems include worn gaskets, dirty fans and
grilles, and ill-fitting and clogged filters. This concern has
resulted in much more specific guidelines being developed for
the maintenance of ventilation systems, some of which are discussed
in Chapter 10. Only by correct functioning can a ventilation system
be relied upon to meet the indoor air quality needs of a building.
<A NAME="ch11"></A>
<P>
Measurement methods are reviewed in Chapter 11. Measurements are
needed to verify the performance of ventilation systems and to
test the integrity of the building shell. They are essential for
commissioning, diagnostic analysis, design evaluation and research.
In addition, measurement results provide the fundamental means
for understanding the mechanics of ventilation and air flow in
buildings. Measurement data are also needed to provide background
information for parametric studies on building air leakage characteristics,
indoor air quality and ventilation system performance. Many measurement
techniques have been developed with each having a specific purpose.
An analysis of principal measurement techniques and applications
is presented.<A NAME="ch12"></A>
<P>
Finally, Chapter 12 reviews recent developments in calculation
techniques. Calculation techniques and numerical models are essential
for any design process. They provide the means by which the designer
can develop and investigate an idea before being committed to
the final product.
<P>
Typical design aspects cover system sizing, performance evaluation,
indoor air quality prediction, energy impact assessment, and cost
benefit analysis. A calculation technique or model is used to
analyse the interaction of design options with fixed constraints.
Such a process is necessarily iterative, with adjustments made
to parameters over which control is possible, until an optimum
design solution is achieved.
<P>
A wide range of methods of varying complexity have been developed
with no single method being universally appropriate. Selection
varies according to the required level of accuracy, the availability
of data and the type of building under investigation.
<P>
As designs have become more complex and performance tolerances
more demanding, it is increasingly important for the designer
to be able to understand and use calculation techniques. This
need has resulted in the development of improved algorithms and
wider availability of design data.
<P>
Techniques cover methods to determine:
<UL>
<LI>air change rates in buildings and rooms.
<LI>the flow rate of air through infiltration and purpose provided
flow openings (network methods).
<LI>air flow pattern in a space (computational fluid dynamics).
</UL>

<P>
Subsidiary calculations cover pollutant transport, energy analysis
and the evaluation of driving forces (wind and stack effect).

<H2>Ten Thousand Papers</H2>

<P>
From small beginnings housed on a shelf in an office at the Building
Research and Information Association in Bracknell, UK, the AIVC's
bibliographic database <A HREF="airbase.html" >AIRBASE </A> has
emerged as one of the most popular and user friendly sources of
specialist information on ventilation and its related subject
areas. All those years ago, the database started out as a subset
of air infiltration related records from its parent database,
Ibsedex. In those days access was via telephone modem and the
database used the now cumbersome and outdated software, Status.
A far cry, one could say, from the <U>ten thousand record </U>strong
library of today with its easy to use IdeaList software and multiple
formats - CD or diskette, using Windows or DOS. The name &quot;AIRBASE&quot;
was coined in its early days, and seems to have proved memorable
and popular despite the occasional query from non-ventilation
related agencies!
<H2>Ten Thousand Enquirers!</H2>

<P>
Seventeen years ago the Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centre
was set up under the auspices of the International Energy Agency.
The bibliographic database was central to its brief, and together
with its library and information service has proved its value
over the years with a total of well over <U>ten thousand enquirers
</U>consulting the services and 100,000 items of literature sent
out over the period.
<P>
Sources are many and varied, including a variety of journals,
reports from research and commercial organisations, conference
proceedings, the AIVC's own publications, which can be provided
on loan, and other items discovered through literature searches
performed on larger databases and through the World Wide Web.
Another major source is of course our own information service
users, many of whom contribute their own work as it is published,
and help to keep the emphasis on new and up-to-date research.
<H2>Information Products and Full Library Support</H2>

<P>
<A HREF="airbase.html" >AIRBASE </A>acts as a source of information
for a variety of information products coming from the AIVC, such
as technical notes, annotated bibliographies and literature lists.
Searches on a wide number of topics are performed for enquirers.
<P>
Around 100 copies of AIRBASE are in current use. Users receive
updates every three months, when the database is updated. At a
cost of &#163;150 to purchasers in participating countries, and
with full library service backup, AIRBASE is a low cost and highly
valuable resource.

<H2>Introduction</H2>

<P>
The Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centre's Numerical Database
has been developed in response to a need to establish a core of
airtightness data suitable for design purposes and model validation.
It has also been developed to provide a focus for data derived
from related International Energy Agency projects. Source information
is contained within a computerised database from which direct
searching for specific material is possible.
<P>
Data have been derived from as wide a range of sources as possible.
Many organisations have contributed to the data presented. By
combining information from these many sources, it has been possible
to consider a far wider range of operating conditions than would
be possible by using the results from a single set of measurements.
<H2>Target Audience</H2>

<P>
The report is aimed at providing default data to designers and
other users who need information on air leakage and ventilation
characteristics for use in calculation models and design applications.
<H2>Caution</H2>

<P>
The data presented are based on measurements published in the
literature and on data provided by various institutions for inclusion
in the Guide. No responsibility is taken for the quality of data.
Wherever possible, applicable Standards or airtightness recommendations
appropriate to the country should be applied to new and retrofit
construction.
<H2>Obtaining the Database</H2>

<P>
The AIVC publishes a printed Technical Note entitled &quot;An
Analysis and Data Summary of the AIVC's Numerical Database&quot;
which is available free to participants only upon <A href="/cgi-bin/aivc/numform.pl" >request  
</A>. The Numerical Database can be obtained in electronic form
by <A href=address.html >contacting the AIVC  </A>, costing &#163;75
UK pounds (plus UK Value Added Tax (VAT) at 17.5%, where applicable).

<P>
The 17th Annual AIVC Conference was convened this year at Hotel
11 in Gothenburg, in western Sweden. For the first time, an invitation
was extended to all participating countries of the <A HREF="http://www.ecbcs.org/" >IEA Energy Conservation in Buildings and Community Systems Programme  
</A>. This resulted in over 100 delegates attending 4 sessions
of oral presentations based on submitted papers and a further
3 poster sessions, a total of 59 presentations from 15 countries.
Topics covered included:<BR>

<P>
The Keynote Speaker at the Conference, Bertil Pettersson, Director
General of the Swedish Board for Building Research, stated in
his address that much of the world's energy is obtained and used
in a non-sustainable way. He continued by stressing that existing
energy supplies must be used more efficiently and renewable energy
sources should be further exploited. Citing the example of Sweden,
he indicated that while the total floor area of the Swedish residential
and service sector building stock had increased by about 40% from
1970 to 1995, the total energy consumption had remained roughly
constant. This implied that the specific energy consumption (energy
used per unit of floor area) had decreased by approximately 25%
during the same period. Furthermore, he also outlined the benefits
of International Energy Agency collaborative research with the
aim of decreasing total energy consumption. The benefits that
he observed included:
<UL>
<LI>shared costs,
<LI>pooled resources,
<LI>the avoidance of mistakes and duplicated efforts, and
<LI>the development of a common understanding of technical methods.
</UL>

<P>
The first paper in the opening session, called &quot;<A HREF="ra74_1.html#n3" >Optimum ventilation and air flow control in buildings?  
</A>&quot;, examined the overall theme of the Conference, and
was presented by Tor-G&ouml;ran Malmstr&ouml;m (<A HREF="http://www.kth.se/index-eng.html" >Royal Institute of Technology  
</A>, Sweden). In this paper he explained the factors affecting
indoor air quality. In particular, he emphasised that internal
pollutant sources should first be controlled and then the quality
of the air entering the room should be verified. He then continued
by discussing how air flow control can be used to determine the
quality and rate of air exchange.
<P>
This session also included <A HREF="ra74_1.html#n4" >a paper by Bjørn Larsen
</A> (The Vekst Foundation, Norway) explaining his computerised
method ( <A HREF="#Figure1" >Figure 1  </A>) for balancing ventilation
systems, a practical demonstration of which was also given at
the Conference. The method he described makes it possible to pre-set
ventilation terminals at the factory to desired pressure loss
characteristics (achieved by damper positioning). In this way,
mechanical ventilation systems can be balanced before they have
been installed.<BR>

Two contributions from the UK <A HREF="http://www.bre.co.uk/" >Building Research Establishment  
</A>focused on office buildings. <A HREF="ra74_2.html#n49" >Martin White
</A> discussed the efficiency of single-sided and cross ventilation
in office spaces, while <A HREF="ra74_2.html#n59" >Brian Webb
</A> considered summer cooling for office-type buildings by night
ventilation. Although not restricted in application to non-residential
buildings, <A HREF="ra74_2.html#n60" >Matheos Santamouris</A>
(University of Athens, Greece) reported on the progress of the
natural ventilation studies made within the European PASCOOL project.
This included single-sided and cross ventilation, as well as flow
through large internal openings in the context of natural ventilation
for cooling. The project has resulted in the development of several
applicable calculation tools. Passive cooling was also the subject
of other presentations from <A HREF="ra74_1.html#n12" >Greece
</A>, Sweden and <A HREF="ra74_1.html#n15" >Switzerland </A>(
<A HREF="#Figure2" >Figure 2  </A>).<BR>

<BR>

<P>
<A HREF="ra74_1.html#n11" >Mikko Suokas</A> (Fincoil-teollisuus
Oy, Finland) advised on how to reduce draught problems in cooled
working rooms. His view was that the 'throw' from air-cooling
devices should stay close to the ceiling for as long as possible,
without interference from either beams, light fittings, or walls.
In this way, the cooled air mixes better with the existing room
air, without causing draughts in the occupied zone.
<P>
Peter Wouters from Belgium (BBRI) expanded on the subject of non-residential
ventilation. In &quot;<A HREF="ra74_1.html#n23" >Ventilation requirements in non-domestic buildings and energy efficiency
</A>&quot;, voted as the Best Paper at the Conference, he proposed
that ventilation rate requirements for non-domestic buildings
may vary by up to a factor of 10 depending on whether or not the
levels of emissions from the building materials are taken into
account. This, he argued, could potentially have a large consequent
effect on energy consumption. <A HREF="ra74_2.html#n38" >Anders Nilson
</A> (Bengt Dahlgren AB, Sweden) also considered energy efficiency,
specifically in office buildings, with an energy and system analysis
study.
<H4>Public Assembly Buildings</H4>

<P>
Findings from measurements made in a cinema (with a downwards
mixing ventilation system) were reported by Yonghui Jin (Narvik
Institute of Technology, Norway). 'Step-up' and 'step-down' tracer
gas measurements enabled the calculation of local and room air
change efficiencies, which indicated that close to perfect mixing
was occurring. Carbon dioxide concentrations were found to vary
linearly with the number of occupants. The design of another type
of public assembly building, in this case a naturally ventilated
concert hall (<A HREF="#Figure3" >Figure 3  </A>), was discussed
by <A HREF="ra74_2.html#n47" >Robert Cohen</A> (HGA Consulting
Engineers Ltd, UK). This project used computational fluid dynamics
to decide the size and locations of the ventilation openings.
In addition, a dynamic thermal model was used to confirm that
the likely number of hours per year above a certain temperature
level was acceptable.<BR>

<H3>Ventilation of <A NAME="Transportation">Transportation</A>-Related
Structures</H3>

<P>
Certain presentations at the Conference examined ventilation of
structures intended for transportation-related purposes. <A HREF="ra74_2.html#n43" >Willem de Gids
</A> (<A href="http://www.tno.nl/instit/bouw/home.html" >TNO  
</A>, Netherlands) described how a dynamic ventilation model had
been used to improve the design of a ventilation system in a train
tunnel with a shopping centre above (<A HREF="#Figure4" >Figure 4  
</A>), thus improving air quality in the centre and reducing cleaning
costs. The problems associated with the cooling and ventilation
of a high speed underground transportation system were outlined
by <A HREF="ra74_1.html#n14" >Peter Rosemann</A> (<A HREF="http://www.ethz.ch/" >Swiss Federal Institute of Technology  
</A>, Switzerland). This major project plans to link the major
Swiss cities with a train network involving partially evacuated
tunnels (to reduce aerodynamic drag). In addition, design guidelines
for ventilation systems for pollution control in large semi-enclosed
bus terminals were presented. Concerning this work, <A HREF="ra74_1.html#n13" >Joanna Yiu
</A> (Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong) indicated that
industrial occupational exposure limits were the most applicable
existing guidelines to deal with the pollutants contained in diesel
fuel exhausts. However, she did not consider them to be ideal,
because they are based on working conditions only for healthy
adults. <BR>

<P>
In his poster, <A HREF="ra74_1.html#n17" >Jerzy Sowa</A> (Warsaw
University of Technology, Poland) compared different methods of
incorporating stochastic factors into deterministic models of
indoor air quality. Approaches taken used time series data as
inputs to contaminant dispersal models, Monte-Carlo analysis,
and a stochastic differential equation model. The mean values
of pollutant concentration found with all three methods were very
similar. However, the spread of the results as measured by the
standard deviation showed a wide variation. Related work was described
by <A HREF="ra74_2.html#n40" >Krystyna Pietrzyk</A> (<A HREF="http://www.hvac.chalmers.se/" >Chalmers University of Technology  
</A>, Sweden). She explained how probability density functions
of the air change rate in a single family house had been derived,
with two-parameter Weibull distributions assumed for the wind
velocity. The air change rates were found to approximately follow
either normal or log-normal distributions depending on the wind
direction.
<P>
<A HREF="ra74_2.html#n41" >Johnny Kronvall</A> (J&amp;W Consulting
Engineers, Sweden) has been investigating system safety analysis
as a method of finding &quot;the probability that a ventilation
system provides certain required air flow rates in each occupied
part of a building during the time between scheduled maintenance
occasions.&quot; He suggested that this is a promising technique
for judging the reliability of mechanical ventilation systems.
But, he cautioned that data for the mechanical reliability of
individual components would need to be collated for it to be practical.
<H3>Applicability of <A NAME="Crack">Crack </A>Flow Equations
</H3>

<P>
Two of the fundamental assumptions concerning the applicability
of crack flow equations have been investigated by researchers
in the UK and the USA. An experimental study of crack flow with
varying pressure differentials was the subject of a presentation
given by <A HREF="ra74_2.html#n36" >Steve Sharples</A> (<A HREF="http://www.shef.ac.uk/" >University of Sheffield  
</A>, UK). He proposed that the results confirmed the often assumed
view that it is acceptable to consider average steady-state pressure
differentials in place of time-varying differentials. Another
important issue discussed at the Conference was that the application
of experimentally measured airtightness data (typically measured
at greater than 10 Pa pressure difference) to numerical models
often relies on an extrapolation down to the pressure differences
(typically less than 10 Pa) encountered due to natural driving
forces. The power law is an appropriate method for extrapolating
from measured airtightness data to lower pressure differences
was the conclusion reached by <A HREF="ra74_2.html#n42" >Max Sherman
</A> (<A href="http://www.lbl.gov/" >Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory  
</A>, USA).
<H3>Measures of Ventilation <A NAME="Performance">Performance
</A></H3>

<P>
<A HREF="ra74_1.html#n10" >Lars Ekberg</A> (<A HREF="http://www.hvac.chalmers.se/" >Chalmers University of Technology  
</A>, Sweden) spoke about how he has been checking ventilation
rates by carbon dioxide monitoring. Again from Sweden, <A HREF="ra74_2.html#n34" >Björn Hedin
</A> (Lund Institute of Technology) introduced a new model to
extract more information from standard tracer gas measurements
of ventilation air flows. The effect of recirculation on air change
effectiveness (sometimes called the coefficient of air change
performance) was the subject of a contribution by <A HREF="ra74_1.html#n5" >Clifford Federspiel
</A> (Johnson Controls Inc, USA). He proposed a relative measure
of air change effectiveness that can be used to take into account
the age of supply air when the fraction of recirculated air is
greater than zero. An advantage of this measure, he argued, is
that it can identify systems in which 'short-circuiting' is occurring.
<P>
<A HREF="ra74_1.html#n25" >Karl Janssens</A> from Belgium (Catholic
University of Leuven) gave an account of laboratory tests for
the determination of 'local specific fresh air flow rates' in
an imperfectly mixed ventilated air space. In addition, work from
France and the UK reported on measurements and modelling respectively
for calculating the pollutant removal effectiveness and air change
efficiency for various ventilation strategies.
<H3>External <A NAME="Contaminants">Contaminants </A>and the Internal
Distribution of Pollutants</H3>

<P>
<A HREF="ra74_1.html#n7" >Vina Kukadia</A>, (<A HREF="http://www.bre.co.uk/" >Building Research Establishment  
</A>, UK) presented the outcome of a pilot study designed to find
the effect of external atmospheric pollution on indoor air quality.
Another external pollutant, radon, is of continuing concern and
in connection with this, <A HREF="ra74_1.html#n8" >Pirjo Korhonen
</A> (University of Kuopio, Finland) has compared indoor levels
of radon between workplaces and homes located nearby in different
parts of Finland. Certain features of particulate pollution interactions
with indoor surfaces were explained by <A HREF="ra74_1.html#n9" >Miriam Byrne
</A> (<A HREF="http://www.ic.ac.uk/" >Imperial College  </A>,
UK), who has been carrying out measurements and modelling for
risk assessment and contaminant control. Also at the Conference,
George Walton (<A href="http://www.bfrl.nist.gov/bed.html" >NIST  
</A>, USA) demonstrated the latest version of his multizone airflow
and contaminant dispersal model, CONTAM96, which includes a graphical
user interface.
<H3><A NAME="Dwellings">Dwellings</A></H3>

<P>
The work of members of the European Standards Committee CEN TC156
(Ventilation) was reported by <A HREF="ra74_2.html#n39" >Andrew Cripps
</A> (<A HREF="http://www.bre.co.uk/" >Building Research Establishment  
</A>, UK) with his paper on calculation methods for the determination
of air flow rates in dwellings. Two delegates from Sweden each
talked about residential ventilation. One of these was <A HREF="ra74_2.html#n54" >Per Levin
</A> (<A HREF="http://www.kth.se/index-eng.html" >Royal Institute of Technology  
</A>, Sweden), who outlined the development of a simple occupancy-controlled
exhaust air ventilation system. The other was <A HREF="ra74_1.html#n27" >Åke Blomsterberg
</A> (Swedish National Testing and Research Institute, Sweden),
who discussed the influence of outdoor air vents and airtightness
on natural ventilation.
<P>
<A HREF="ra74_1.html#n22" >Max Sherman</A> (<A href="http://www.lbl.gov/" >Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory  
</A>, USA) proposed the most appropriate types of residential
ventilation systems for the different regions of the USA. This
was based on modelling for various levels of airtightness of the
dwelling stock to predict resultant energy consumption while still
meeting ventilation requirements. On a connected subject, <A HREF="ra74_2.html#n50" >Don Stevens
</A> (Stevens and Associates, USA) identified the evolution of
ventilation in manufactured housing in the north-western United
States. The findings from a measurement survey of the indoor air
quality of 30 houses with distributed heating systems in Quebec
were given by <A HREF="ra74_1.html#n21" >Denis Parent</A> (Hydro-Qu&eacute;bec,
Canada). He concluded that during the milder part of the heating
season only the minority of the tested houses had adequate ventilation,
with an improvement during the colder part. Also, there didn't
seem to be a significant correlation between building airtightness
and indoor air quality.
<H4>IEA ECBCS Annex 27</H4>

<P>
Other contributions on dwellings concerned products of the continuing
work of <A HREF="http://www.ecbcs.org/annex27.html" >IEA ECBCS Annex 27  
</A>&quot;Evaluation and Demonstration of Domestic Ventilation
Systems&quot;. <A HREF="ra74_1.html#n24" >Peter Op't Veld</A>
(Cauberg-Huygen Consulting Engineers, Netherlands) gave an overview
of his assessment of aspects of noise and ventilation systems.
This covered the transmission of outdoor noise, noise generated
by ventilation system components and the impact of a system on
sound transmission in or between dwellings. His work for this
Annex has produced a simplified tool for the selection of ventilation
systems based on the criteria of noise. Also as part of Annex
27, Lars-G&ouml;ran M&aring;nsson (LGM Consult AB, Sweden) outlined
the progress made in developing a simplified tool for evaluating
domestic ventilation systems' ability to provide an acceptable
indoor air quality.
<P>
Multi-zone calculations of air flows and tracer gas measurements
in dwellings were compared by <A HREF="ra74_2.html#n44" >Charlotte Svensson
</A> (J&amp;W Consulting Engineers, Sweden). This forms part of
the Swedish contribution to Annex 27. The study highlighted the
good agreement that can be obtained between measurements and calculations
when the input parameters of the model are consistent with the
experimental configuration. Along similar lines, <A HREF="ra74_1.html#n19" >Jacques Riberon
</A> (<A HREF="http://193.104.99.10/" >CSTB  </A>, France) gave
an account of a comparison of ventilation systems performances
in residential buildings made with the model SIREN.

<P>
Conventionally, air dehumidification has been achieved by refrigerative
systems. However with current environmental concerns, alternative
approaches are being sought. As part of an investigation of dehumidification
by absorption, <A HREF="ra74_2.html#n55" >Jürgen Röben</A> (<A href="http://www.uni-essen.de/" >University of Essen  
</A>, Germany) described a theoretical model of an open cycle
dehumidification process using hygroscopic materials to absorb
the moisture.The Best Poster at the Conference was awarded to
Peter Hansson (<A HREF="http://www.kth.se/index-eng.html" >Royal Institute of Technology  
</A>, Sweden) for his poster, &quot;<A HREF="ra74_2.html#n52" >A technique to improve the performance of displacement ventilation during cold climate conditions
</A>&quot;. He has devised a method of using warm air extracted
at ceiling level to heat cold surfaces and so improve ventilation
efficiency and thermal comfort by reducing downdraught.

<H2>About the AIVC</H2>

<P>
Ventilation and air infiltration into buildings represent a substantial
energy demand which can account for between 25% to over 50% of
a building's total space heating (or cooling) needs. Unnecessary
or excessive air change can therefore have an important impact
on global energy use. On the other hand insufficient ventilation
may result in poor indoor air quality and consequential health
problems.
<P>
Designing for optimum ventilation performance is hence a vital
part of building design. This task is made especially difficult,
however, by the complexities of airflow behaviour, climatic influences,
occupancy patterns and pollutant emission characteristics.
<P>
In recognition of the significant impact of ventilation on energy
use, combined with concerns over indoor air quality, the <A HREF="http://www.iea.org/" >International Energy Agency  
</A>(IEA) inaugurated the Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centre
in 1979. The role of the centre is to provide technical support
to those involved in the research and development of ventilation
technology as well as to ensure the widest dissemination of information
on related energy and air quality issues.
<P>
The AIVC fulfils its objectives by providing a range of services
and facilities which include:
<H2><A NAME="Information">Information</A> Services</H2>

<P>
The Centre provides a comprehensive information service, the hub
of which is its bibliographic database - <A href="airbase.html" >AIRBASE  
</A>. This contains abstracts of several thousand specialist articles
related to ventilation and associated issues. AIRBASE is regularly
updated and may be accessed via the Centre or may be obtained
in machine readable form for operation on IBM PC compatible computers.

<P>
The concentration of metabolically produced carbon dioxide (CO2)
in a space has become a popular indicator of indoor air quality.
Increasingly, it is used to control ventilation systems and as
a measure of compliance with various Codes and Standards. There
is underlying concern, however, that such measurements could give
erroneous information and that there may be a general misconception
about the significance of metabolic CO2. The purpose of this note
is to summarise recent contributions on this topic, with specific
reference to a Seminar and Forum on metabolic carbon dioxide which
took place earlier this year at the Atlanta <A HREF="http://www.ashrae.org/" >ASHRAE  
</A>meeting. The reasons for so much interest in CO2 were summarised
at this meeting by Andrew Persily of the US National Institute
of Science and Testing (<A href="http://www.bfrl.nist.gov/bed.html" >NIST  
</A>). He emphasised that carbon dioxide is metabolically produced
and can therefore be associated with the presence of occupants.
Also it is relatively easy and inexpensive to measure, and it
is fairly stable in that it is not especially reactive or absorbed
by surfaces. In principle CO2 can be used to evaluate the ventilation
rate, determine the proportion of outdoor air that is blended
with recirculated air and provide an indication of perceived indoor
air quality.
<H2>CO2 and <A NAME="Toxicity">Toxicity</A></H2>

<P>
The health and toxicity implications of carbon dioxide were reviewed
by Michael Hodgson, MD of the University of Connecticut Health
Sciences Center. His research indicates that, despite largely
untested reports to the contrary, there is no physiological evidence
that CO2 has any metabolic influence at concentrations below about
8500 ppm. Between 8500 -10,000 ppm the tidal flow of air through
the lungs is increased and above 34,000 ppm the respiratory system
becomes more rapid. At 40-45,000 ppm sweating occurs and at about
50,000ppm anxiety is induced. He also reported that in the 19th
century, CO2 was used as a narcotic for surgery, where concentrations
approaching 500,000 ppm (50%) were needed. Under all but extreme
occupancy conditions, therefore, the removal of CO2 from a space
on grounds that it in itself influences health cannot normally
be regarded as an issue.
<H2><A NAME="Metabolically">Metabolically </A>Produced CO<I><B>2
</B></I></H2>

<P>
Carbon dioxide is produced as part of metabolism. The rate of
production is fairly well defined and is dependent on the level
of metabolic activity. Examples are illustrated in <A HREF="#Table1" >Table 1  
</A>(BS5925,1990). On this issue, Michael Hodgson noted that,
for any specific activity, production rate increases with body
weight, reflecting the greater level of physical effort which
must be applied. He also noted that physically fit people are
able to do a greater level of work for each unit of CO2 produced.

<H2><A NAME="Outdoor">Outdoor </A>or Background CO2 Concentration
</H2>

<P>
Carbon dioxide is a constituent of the outdoor air and evidence
suggests that its ambient concentration is gradually increasing.
Actual outdoor concentration is dependent on locality and varies
from between approximately 350 ppm, away from urban areas, to
approximately 400 ppm in city environments.
<H2><A NAME="Indoor">Indoor </A>or Room Concentration of CO2</H2>

<P>
The indoor concentration of carbon dioxide depends on the outdoor
level and the production rate of CO2 within the space. In the
office, this extra contribution is primarily assumed to result
from metabolism, but in the home open gas cookers could make a
further significant contribution. Strictly, to determine the contribution
to CO2 generated in a space, the <I>difference </I>between the
indoor concentration and the outdoor concentration should be measured.
However, for approximate purposes, an outdoor value of between
350-400 ppm is usually assumed. It is important to be aware, however,
that, for precision analysis, some authors, when refering to indoor
CO2 concentration, automatically subtract the outdoor value (i.e
they give the<I> difference </I>value). On the otherhand most
standards, that refer to an acceptable indoor CO2 concentration,
refer to the <I>absolute </I>or <I>total</I> room concentration.
<H2><A NAME="Steady">Steady </A>State Concentration</H2>

<P>
Metabolically produced CO2 behaves like any other pollutant in
that for a given level of occupancy and rate of ventilation, its
concentration will asymptotically rise to a 'steady state' value.
At steady state, the concentration will depend on both the outdoor
air ventilation rate and the CO2 production rate, while the time
taken to reach steady state concentration will depend on the 'air
change' rate alone. The approximate relationship between steady
state concentration (absolute) and ventilation rate is illustrated
in <A HREF="#Figure1" >Figure 1  </A>. If steady state concentration
has been achieved, and the level of activity is known then, provided
there is no other source of generation, the measured CO2 concentration
provides an indication of the amount of 'fresh' outdoor air being
supplied to each occupant.
<H2><A NAME="Transient">Transient </A>Concentration</H2>

<P>
More often than not, steady state concentration is not reached.
Either the volume of enclosed space is so large that it would
take many hours to achieve or the level of occupancy is continually
varying. Under these circumstances a 'spot' measurement of CO2
can become meaningless. Various techniques have been developed,
however, to estimate ventilation rate from the transient CO2 concentration.
<A HREF="#References" >Persily (1996, 1994)  </A>, has investigated
this in detail and offers several solutions. This aspect has also
been addressed by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA),
following concern that too much reliance is placed on transient
spot measurements. John Girman of the EPA indoor environmental
division described work involved in looking at the errors associated
with spot measurements and devising methods to improve upon ventilation
estimated from CO2 measurements. The main areas of error were
concerned with the time it takes to reach steady state, assumptions
about the rate of CO2 generation and fluctuations in outdoor concentration.
Below about 3 air changes/hour approximately three hours is needed
to achieve a steady state condition, however, work in progress
(<A HREF="#References" >Mudarri, 1996  </A>) highlights how allowances
can be made for the non attainment of steady state conditions
based on the duration and level of occupancy. For improved accuracy,
more precise knowledge is needed about metabolic generation rate,
for example the ratio of production for men and women in similar
activity is approximately 1:0.76. Such allowances have been incorporated
by Mudarri into a 10 Step Guide to estimating air change rate
from relatively straightforward parameters.<BR>

<P>
Andrew Persily reviewed some of the background to the interest
in CO2 including its relationship with peoples' perception of
indoor air quality, principally in relation to odour. He cited
a number of examples indicating the relationship between CO2 concentration
and body odour. Particularly, there was consistent data linking
CO2 concentration with the percentage of people 'visiting' a space
who were 'dissatisfied' with the level of odour (ppd). This linkage
is associated with the actual CO2 concentration measured rather
than the steady state value. Typically, 20% ppd corresponds to
a CO2 concentration of 650 ppm above the outdoor value (i.e. approximately
1000 ppm actual CO2 concentration (<A HREF="#Figure2" >Figure 2  
</A>).<BR>

<H2><A NAME="Measuring">Measuring </A>CO2</H2>

<P>
Various techniques are available for the measurement of carbon
dioxide, a summary of which was presented by Richard Stoner of
Solomat Neotronics. Further information is also described in Chapter
11 of the Guide to Ventilation (<A HREF="#References" >Liddament, 1996  
</A>). Techniques vary from precision mass spectrometry to inexpensive
detection tubes that undergo colour change in reaction to the
presence of carbon dioxide. Probably the most common method for
demand control systems is non-dispersive infra-red detection which
makes use of the property of a gas to absorb energy from an infra-red
light source. The resultant heat generated is detected as a volumetric
change. This absorption property is also applied to photo-acoustic
detection in which absorption from a pulsed infrared source, tuned
to the specific characteristics of CO2, is translated to a sound
wave. The sound intensity is related to gas concentration. Both
systems have a resolution of typically +/- 50 ppm and suffer from
drift caused by dust on optics and a gradual deterioration in
lamp performance. Other methods include potentiometric in which
CO2 is diffused into an electrolyte resulting in a change in applied
voltage and amperometric based on the electrochemical diffusion
of CO2 across a membrane into an electrolyte. Again sensitivity
is typically +/- 50-100 ppm and drift can be significant. Sensor
life can also be limited.
<P>
Problems and experiences associated with the measurement of metabolically
produced CO2 were further highlighted at an informal forum aimed
at assessing the role of CO2 measurements as a means of estimating
outdoor air ventilation rates. Experiences indicated significant
instrument drift. One monitored study showed that after a few
months a system having a set point of 1000 ppm did not react until
the actual concentration had reached 1800 ppm. Several contributors
emphasised the need for regular instrument calibration. The conclusion,
therefore, must be that any demand control sensor must contain
provision for simple (possibly automatic) calibration. In short,
an unattended system will fail, probably within only a few months.
<H2>'Demand' <A NAME="Control">Control </A>Ventilation</H2>

<P>
Notwithstanding problems associated with monitoring metabolic
CO2, it has become a popular component of demand control ventilation
systems. This formed part of a major Research Task (<A HREF="http://www.ecbcs.org/annex18.html" >Annex 18  
</A>) of the International Energy Agency's Implementing Agreement
for Energy Conservation in Buildings and Community Systems (<A HREF="#References" >Mansson, 1990  
</A>).
<H2><A NAME="Conclusions">Conclusions</A></H2>

<P>
Carbon dioxide is largely non-toxic with evidence suggesting that
concentrations as high as 10,000 ppm or more have no significant
health effects.
<P>
For normal conditions of occupancy, however, measured CO2 concentrations
significantly above 1000 ppm provide an indication of inadequate
ventilation for comfort and may mean that the ventilation rate
is inadequate to dilute other, more harmful pollutants that may
be present. In this sense, the monitoring of CO2 concentration
can make a valuable contribution to IAQ assessment.
<P>
Unfortunately, a measurement of concentration (especially a 'spot'
measurement) at or below 1000 ppm does not necessarily provide
an indication of the adequacy of ventilation since there may be
other pollutants present or insufficient time has elapsed to provide
a steady state reading, or the building may be at reduced occupancy.
<P>
If CO2 is continuously monitored then it is possible to evaluate
the adequacy of air change by considering the rates of growth
and decay in concentration as the occupancy level varies.

<H2><A NAME="Introduction">Introduction</A></H2>

<P>
Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is increasingly being used
at the design stage for the evaluation of air distribution and
smoke control systems in a wide range of building types.
<P>
CFD computer software operates by numerically solving the equations
governing fluid flow <A HREF="#References" >[1] </A>. These comprise
conservation statements for mass, momentum, energy and turbulence
parameters. The equations contain partial derivatives, are highly
non-linear and require an iterative solution procedure<I><B> 
</B></I>to yield results.
<H2>What must be <A NAME="defined">defined </A>when using CFD
software?</H2>

<P>
The process of running CFD software involves defining the factors
which drive the flow (boundary conditions) such as supply air
diffusers, natural ventilation openings, exhaust locations and
flow rates, heat gains, and hot or cold surfaces together with
any objects or obstructions in the space. These are mapped to
a computational grid which forms three-dimensional volumes of
space completely filling the enclosure to be modelled. The equations
are solved at each one of these 'control volumes', usually called
'cells' in 'finite-volume' codes and 'elements' in the alternative
'finite-element' codes. Historically, the finite-volume approach
was developed in cartesian (rectangular) geometries. The finite-element
method has traditionally allowed more complex and hence realistic
geometries to be modelled although the developments which have
taken place in CFD mean that many of the old distinctions have
become blurred. More accurate techniques for numerically integrating
the flow equations coupled with complex geometry capability in
finite-volume codes provide a similar level of functionality to
the traditional finite-element approach. Finite element codes
themselves are changing, further reducing the distance between
them.
<P>
The user has control over the grid and it is the resolution of
the grid which can have an important influence on the accuracy
of results. The finer the grid the better but the longer it will
take to achieve a solution. A typical grid will comprise many
thousands of 'cells' <A HREF="#References" >[2, 3] </A>. Most
commercial CFD software uses the finite-volume approach to form
the numerical integral of the partial differential equations.
Regarding complexity of modelling, much can still be done with
cartesian geometry representations - taking advantage of the much
easier model building and faster execution speed.
<P>
In using CFD, which places major demands on computer processor
speed and RAM (memory), there is always a compromise to be made
between accuracy and speed of solution. However, CFD software
is becoming more user-friendly and computers very much faster
such that high-specification PC's (e.g. fast 486's, Pentium and
Pentium Pro) can be particularly cost-effective in running CFD
codes and contributing successfully within the time-frame of the
design process.
<H2>How are the <A NAME="results">results </A>presented?</H2>

<P>
Once a solution is obtained the results can be viewed in graphical
form as flow patterns (vector plots), temperature and smoke contours,
etc. (An example is shown in <A HREF="#Figure1" >Figure 1 </A>.)
The numerical values can be interpreted to make judgements about
the acceptability of the thermal environment in terms of air velocities,
temperatures, temperature gradients and ventilation effectiveness.
In fire modelling it is temperatures and the development and movement
of smoke which is the focus of interest either in a 'steady-state'
form or evolving with time.<BR>

<P>

<BR>

<H2>Are CFD results <A NAME="realistic">realistic</A>?</H2>

<P>
Validation is always an issue with any computer calculation method.
With CFD the issue is more complex than usual because of the influence
the user can have over the quality of results. This is particularly
important in the context of setting boundary conditions, defining
the computational grid and procuring converged solutions in high
Rayleigh Number (highly buoyant) flow fields within an acceptable
computation time. Turbulence modelling is also still an area requiring
more research and development. Here, it is the 'k-epsilon' model
which is still the 'industry standard' for engineering calculations.
Despite the ever present need for more work, sufficient validation
has already been done such that, with experience and care, one
can have a good level of confidence in the quality of the results
<A HREF="#References" >[4] </A>. (Much analysis has taken place
in IEA ECBCS Annex 26 &quot;Air Flow in Large Enclosures&quot;
to evaluate the performance of CFD and to determine the conditions
under which it is applicable <A HREF="#References" >[5] </A>.)
<H2><A NAME="Examples">Examples</A></H2>

<P>
Figures 1, 2 and 3 show example results from three different types
of CFD simulations. The first simulation, <A HREF="#Figure1" >Figure 1  
</A>, is of temperatures and flow patterns in a three-dimensional
model of a naturally ventilated shopping mall. The ventilation
system comprises low level openings with flow entering from the
left in the Figure and exiting at high level through the roof
exhaust stack. The outdoor temperature is 16 &#176;C. Occupancy,
lighting and solar gains elevate the temperature up to approximately
21 &#176;C at high level. Here, the CFD code used has predicted
the natural ventilation flow rate based on external wind pressures,
stack (buoyancy) effect and the resistance of the openings.<BR>

<P>
<I><A NAME="Figure2">Figure 2</A> Flow in a laboratory space ventilated
by laminar flow panels in ceiling.</I>
<P>

<IMG SRC="gwfig2.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM" >
<BR>

<P>
The second example, shown in <A HREF="#Figure2" >Figure 2 </A>,
represents flow in a laboratory space ventilated by laminar flow
panels in the ceiling. The exhaust air is taken through a fume
cupboard extract. The Figure shows speed contours, illustrating
the acceleration of flow into the fume cupboard and the wake-influence
due to the proximity of the operator. Both the room air distribution
and the fume cupboard containment effectiveness are being examined
here.
<P>
In the third simulation, <A HREF="#Figure3" >Figure 3 </A>, the
development of temperatures and smoke concentrations are predicted
in the atrium and occupied areas of a multi-floor office building.
Outdoor air enters the atrium at ground level and natural smoke
vents allow the smoke to escape at roof level. The temperature
stratification in the smoke layer can be seen. At ground level,
the volume of outside air entering the building maintains a clear
layer, and on the upper floors it is noticeable that floor supply
air diffusers (which remain in operation supplying fresh air)
are helping to minimise the full impact of the smoke temperatures.
From the information generated by CFD judgements can be made regarding
the safety and escape of occupants.<BR>

<H2><A NAME="Conclusions">Conclusions</A></H2>

<P>
Fortunately, much of the complexity of a user-friendly CFD code
is transparent to the user, who need not concern him/herself about
partial differential equations. What is important, though, is
that the user is able to properly describe the application to
be modelled, to ensure that the solution obtained satisfies certain
criteria regarding grid resolution and the consequent residual
errors in the solution, and then exercise engineering ability
in interpreting the results. An advantage of CFD is that, if necessary,
improvements can readily be made to the air distribution design
or smoke control system and the calculation re-run.
<P>
The question of cost-effectiveness is particularly important.
Historically, such computer codes have been too expensive and
too difficult to use to make a substantial impact in the buildings
and construction industry. Now, however, CFD software prices are
falling and performance and usability increasing such that acquiring
an in-house CFD capability or, indeed, commissioning external
CFD studies can be a realistic and relatively low-cost option
giving a substantial return in the quality of the project.

<P>
As revealed by the last ZEPHYR competition <A HREF="#References" >(1)  
</A>, natural ventilation is the first design strategy used by
architects or designers to reduce building cooling loads and improve
indoor comfort in Mediterranean countries where air conditioning
systems do not represent a systematical and realistic alternative.
Unfortunately, if the effects of natural ventilation on the energy
balance of a room or on the perceived comfort of the occupant
have been extensively described and can be experienced by anyone,
the prediction and design of natural ventilation and its integration
in building design as a passive cooling strategy is not really
well dominated. In order to fill these existing gaps, natural
ventilation phenomena have been extensively studied in the framework
of the PASCOOL research project <A HREF="#References" >(2) </A>.
The coordinated efforts of research groups from Belgium (BBRI),
France (University of La Rochelle and ENTPE), Greece (University
of Athens), Italy ( University of Milano), Portugal (University
of Porto), Spain (University of Malaga) and Switzerland (EPFL)
have made this PASCOOL task one of the most significant contributions
to natural ventilation studies in the recent years.
<H2><A NAME="Aims">Aims </A>and Strategies of the Ventilation
PASCOOL Task</H2>

<P>
Based on a huge experimental programme, various different aspects
of the problem were covered during the PASCOOL project:
<UL>
<LI>single sided ventilation
<LI>cross ventilation/
<LI>airflow through large openings
<LI>night ventilation and the coupling with thermal mass.
</UL>

<P>
More than a hundred single sided and cross ventilation experiments
were performed in various buildings and test cells located in
different countries in Europe. In order to evaluate the ventilation
flow rates, experimental techniques using tracer gases have been
experienced and tested in natural ventilation configuration as
well as energy balance approaches. Various geometrical and climatic
configurations have been tested. Combined ventilation and thermal
mass experiments have also been performed to study air flow patterns
in multizone buildings presenting important stack effects.&lt;R&gt;
<P>
Various models have also been tested in order to predict natural
ventilation air flows in buildings. New models resulting from
the experiments have been proposed and integrated in a new air
flow model PASSPORT-Air based on a network approach. In order
to feed this code with realistic data, the group has developed
CPCALC+ <A HREF="#References" >(3) </A> a new method predicting
the pressure coefficients on building surfaces for various shapes
of building and roofs. Wind tunnel experiments using three boundary
layer profiles have been used to obtain regression curves for
the determination of the pressure coefficient distribution.
<P>
Finally a new approach using zonal modelling has been proposed
in order to assess air flow patterns in naturally ventilated rooms.
<H2><A NAME="Final">Final </A>Products and Main Results of the
PASCOOL Natural Ventilation Task</H2>

<P>
All the results of the Ventilation task are presented in the &#171;Ventilation-Thermal
Mass Subtask Final Report&#187; <A HREF="#References" >(2) </A>organised
into six chapters describing the contributions of the PASCOOL
Group to the various aspects of natural ventilation. In this short
presentation, we will focus on three main contributions, Single
Sided Ventilation, Cross Ventilation and Air Flow Modelling.
<H2><A NAME="Single">Single </A>Sided Ventilation</H2>

<P>
Single sided ventilation experiments were carried out in real
buildings located in Athens, Madrid and Lyon, and in fully equipped
test cells . Two of them in Athens and BBRI were developed within
the frame of the PASSYS Project. A third one located in Porto
has also been used. Most of the experiments were performed using
tracer gas decay techniques.
<P>
A total of 76 experiments were performed in Greece composing the
largest data base on single sided ventilation. From this data
base, a model has been proposed introducing a correction factor,
CF by which the theoretical flow equations of the network model
have to be multiplied to give more realistic results. Furthermore,
a correlation giving CF in terms of thermal and flow characteristics
has been proposed.
<P>
CF = 0.08 (Gr / (Re^2) )^-0.38 (1)
<P>
With Gr: Grashof number calculated on the height of the opening
and the reference temperature difference, and Re, Reynolds number
calculated using the reference velocity and the depth of the cavity.
<P>
This model has been validated using the results of other single
sided ventilation and it is convenient when the inertial flow
due to wind speed is the driving phenomenon. In the case of higher
temperature differences between outdoor and indoor conditions,
experiments carried out by BBRI in Belgium have demonstrated that
a multi term model is more efficient. This model takes into account
each physical contribution to the air flow by means of a new formulation.
<P>
Q = (Q_net(Cd, Delta_T)^2 + (aAV)^2 + (bA)^2)^0.5 (2)
<P>
With Q_net air flow rate calculated by the network model using
Cd = 0.66, A opening area (m^2), V Wind speed (m/s), a, b wind
and turbulence parameters related to investigated environment.
<P>
It has also been shown in the BBRI experiments that the heterogeneity
of the concentration field is an important source of uncertainty
when evaluating air flow rates due to natural ventilation. A thermal
balance of the room is certainly, when possible, a more accurate
way.
<P>
Indeed, as said before, these models are certainly limited to
a reduced number of conditions (wind direction, wind speed and
temperature differences), and further investigation is now needed
to extend their applicability domain.
<H2><A NAME="Cross">Cross </A>Ventilation</H2>

<P>
From a literature review, various models have been investigated
<H3>Global air flow rate prediction</H3>

<P>
Aynsley's Model (1977) <A HREF="#References" >(4) </A><BR>
Vickery's Model (1987) <A HREF="#References" >(5) </A><BR>
Global resistance approach (Aynsley 1988) <A HREF="#References" >(6)  
</A><BR>
Virtual Stream tube method (Murakami 1991) <A HREF="#References" >(7)  
</A>
<H3>Velocity Coefficient Approaches</H3>

<P>
Gouin (1984) <A HREF="#References" >(8) </A><BR>
Givonni (1988) <A HREF="#References" >(9) </A><BR>
Ernest (1991) <A HREF="#References" >(10) </A>
<P>
This review shows that there is a wide range of uncertainty in
these various models. In most cases the applicability limits are
not well described, and they can be very difficult to extend to
general cases.
<P>
In order to study a wide range of configurations, different experimental
facilities have been used in Belgium, Greece, Spain and Switzerland.
The resulting experiments were carried out using either constant
injection or decay methods.
<P>
Single zone and two zone experiments carried out in Athens used
the Aynsley model to identify the discharge coefficient of the
openings. A low value of .2 has been identified and does not seem
to be influenced by the thermal conditions. In these experiments,
the mixing of the tracer gas was found to be very good. This result
is surprising and disagrees with Murakami's description of an
inertial flow crossing the room.
<P>
On the contrary, the experiments carried out in Mendillory building
in Spain showed a real difficulty in assessing a good homogeneity
of the tracer gas in cross ventilation configuration. In this
case, the decay method appears to be more appropriate than the
constant injection.
<P>
Givonni's model giving the mean velocity within the cell has also
been used in order to propose various correlations. Nevertheless,
the whole experience of cross ventilation studies carried out
during the PASCOOL Project clearly shows that specific experimental
facilities are now necessary to go a step further. The boundary
conditions have to be controlled very carefully in order to give
a strict indication of the limits of applicability of the various
existing models.
<H2><A NAME="Air">Air </A>Flow Predictions</H2>

<P>
During the PASCOOL Project, the modelling activities were split
into two main contributions. On the one hand, a multizone air
flow model PASSPORT-Air adapted to natural ventilation conditions
has been developed and evaluated through the large experimental
PASCOOL data base. On the other hand, a new approach using zonal
modelling has been investigated. PASSPORT-Air is based on a nodal
concept, each zone of a building is represented by a pressure
node. Boundary nodes are also representing the outside environment,
and flow equations are used to calculate the air flows through
each flow path. Cracks, windows, doors and shafts are considered,
and special care has been devoted to the prediction of natural
ventilation flows.<BR>

<P>
This model has been evaluated by comparison with five other airflow
models, namely ESP, COMIS, BREEZE, AIRNET, and NORMA. Almost similar
airflow rates are predicted by all tools when assuming regular
air flow equations as shown in <A HREF="#Table_1" >Table 1 </A>.
Nevertheless the introduction of the Correction Factor significantly
improves the accuracy of the prediction. The correlation coefficient
between experimental values and numerical prediction goes from
0.4 without CF to 0.75 with CF correction. <A HREF="#Figure_1" >Figure 1  
</A>presents this result. Further validation of the model is obviously
necessary to confirm this result, and special care in cross ventilation
prediction will be required.<BR>

<P>

with experimental results<BR>

<IMG SRC="allafig.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM" >
</I>
<P>
The limits of airflow network models are well known. While they
can predict the air flow rates between the zones of a building
and the outdoors, they are not able to give any information about
airflow patterns and velocity field within the rooms although
these data are obviously necessary when dealing with comfort prediction
or natural ventilation efficiency. CFD codes could be used for
this purpose, however they are very heavy to use and the results
are sometimes questionnable when using a limited number of nodes
or wall functions. An intermediate concept has been developed
over few years introducing an empirical description of a cavity
in dominant flows: boundary layers, jets or plumes. These flows
can be described by analytical functions or empirical correlations
and mass balance and energy balance in each zone of the room are
then sufficient to predict air flow patterns and heat flows <A HREF="#References" >(12)  
</A>. During the PASCOOL Project this concept has been used in
order to predict natural ventilation flow patterns within a room.
The results obtained in comparison with those of CFD prediction
are encouraging and further research in this field is very promising.
<H2><A NAME="Conclusion">Conclusion</A></H2>

<P>
A large research effort in the field of natural ventilation has
been carried out during the PASCOOL E.C. Project. Various aspects
of the problem such as single sided ventilation, cross ventilation,
airflow prediction, night ventilation or large internal openings
have been studied, and an important confrontation of experimental
knowledge and theroretical analysis has led to a real improvement
of experience in this domain. Nevertheless, necessary studies
have also been identified in order to improve the description
of outdoor conditions around buildings and of heterogeneous indoor
environment. Furthermore, another important effort is also necessary
to transform the scientific knowledge acquired during such a project
into efficient design tools and guidelines for architects and
engineers.

ASHRAE Standard 62 on Minimum Ventilation for Acceptable Indoor
Air Quality has become the 'Model' for ventilation standards in
many countries. The latest revision is currently undergoing public
review. Included is a proposed change to the specification of
ventilation rate which separately takes into account pollutant
generated from occupants and that generated from furnishings and
fittings. This is quoted at 3.0 l/s.p and 0.35 l/s.m2 of floor
area. Assuming an office occupation density of approximately 10
m2/occupant, the per occupant ventilation rate amounts to about
6.5 l/s.p and corresponds to a steady state indoor CO2 concentration
of 1000 ppm. However, in more densely occupied spaces, CO2 concentrations
of up to 2000 ppm can be expected.
<P>

Both David Etheridge and Mats Sandberg are well known for their
pioneering work in improving the theoretical understanding of
ventilation and air movement in buildings. This comprehensive
presentation details the knowledge they have gained during the
course of their research. It focuses on fundamentals and theory
and is therefore deeply mathematical. Topics cover mechanisms,
flow through envelope openings, mathematical models, mass transport,
mixing, momentum, buoyancy, air flow in rooms, flow through large
openings, experimental techniques for evaluating flow characteristics,
multi-zone representation of buildings, tracer gas methods for
ventilation and age of air evaluation, scale models and computational
fluid dynamics. It also considers both natural and mechanical
ventilation. This textbook represents a definitive account of
the theory and measurement of ventilation and should be suitable
for anyone who requires a good numerical outline of the topic.

<H2><A NAME="Inexpensive">Inexpensive </A>Ventilation Pre-heat
Absorbs in Excess of 60% of Solar Energy</H2>

<P>
The United States National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)
in Golden, Colorado, in conjunction with Conserval Systems Inc,
in Buffalo, NY have developed a solar collector which pre heats
incoming ventilation air by as much as 30oC. It consists of a
dark corrugated perforated sheet that is mounted several centimetres
from a sun facing wall. The dark panel absorbs solar radiation
and heats incoming air drawn through its perforations into a plenum.
Heat escaping from the building is also captured in this plenum.
Solar heat transfer has been maximised by optimising the air flow
rate, and the spacing and size of the perforations. The simplicity
of this product ensures reliability and ease of production. Above
all it does not contain any of the complexities of earlier solar
panels.
<P>
The system has been demonstrated in a wide variety of buildings.
In cold climates it takes advantage of both direct and diffuse
solar radiation to provide pre-heat, while in warm climates, especially
in developing areas, it has important applications in crop drying.
The 'Transpired Solar Collector' has been recognised by the United
States Department of Energy's, 'Energy Related Inventions Program'
as being among the top 2% of energy inventions. It also features
DOE's R&amp;D 100 award.

<P>
From Japan comes the 'Swindow'. This is a counterbalanced openable
window that responds to pressure difference, thus allowing an
almost constant air flow rate irrespective of driving force. Both
exhaust and supply versions are available. It is recommended that
supply windows are set in the lower part of opposite walls, while
exhaust windows are placed in the upper part of the same walls
(see Figure). Irrespective of the nature of the driving force
or the direction of wind, a cross flow or stack flow ventilation
pattern will be established.

<P>
This short article aims to inform modellers and model users about
efficient sensitivity analysis methods. Also presented is a tool
under development aimed at simplifying the application of sensitivity
methods. Such techniques are essential to add confidence to numerical
prediction. Too often, simulation data are presented without any
error bars and any information on their accuracy. They are obtained
with a single run of the model, and the influence of the input
uncertainty is ignored. Sometimes, although less often, a one-parameter-at-a-time
sensitivity analysis is performed, requiring a relatively long
time and providing no indication of interactions and unsuspected
effects.
<P>
It is important to understand that efficient methods exist for
sensitivity analysis and that they are widely used in such fields
as environmental risk analysis, economics, and the aircraft, nuclear
and defence industries. In those fields, modellers are required
to verify their results with sensitivity and error analyses <A HREF="#References" >[6]  
</A>.
<H2><A NAME="Techniques">Techniques</A></H2>

<P>
It is a challenge for modellers to distribute models which cannot
be misused too easily. This means asking the user about the uncertainty
of the input, calculating confidence intervals, providing means
to perform sensitivity and error analysis, and addressing these
topics in the user manual and in simulation reports. It can also
mean including a specialist on sensitivity analysis in the development
team.
<P>
One of the arguments used to justify the avoidance of sensitivity
analysis is that the problem has too many input parameters. This
can be overcome by using techniques such as the 'Monte Carlo'
which is capable of being used to calculate confidence intervals
in one hundred runs for any number of varying input parameters
(&#177;14% accuracy if Gaussian hypothesis is valid) <A HREF="#References" >[3,10]  
</A>. Plackett and Burman designs exist which allow users to calculate
all main effects of N parameters with N+1 runs, for N up to 100
or more <A HREF="#References" >[15]  </A>. Sobol method exists
which makes possible apportionment of the linear and nonlinear
sensitivity between parameters or groups of parameters <A HREF="#References" >[8,19]  
</A>. Sequential bifurcation exists which screens important effects
with a small number of runs much smaller than the number of varying
parameters (i.e. 136 runs to extract 23 major parameters from
390) <A HREF="#References" >[16,17]  </A>. For parametric or optimization
studies, statistical techniques are available which minimize the
number of simulations. They are usually based on surface response
techniques <A HREF="#References" >[11]  </A>.
<P>
In September 1995, the SAMO (Sensitivity Analysis of Model Output)
conference in Belgirate was dedicated to those techniques and
their use in different fields. The proceedings can be obtained
via the Internet by connecting to <A HREF="http://rea.ei.jrc.it/SAMO/" >http://rea.ei.jrc.it/SAMO/  
</A>and down-loading files <A HREF="#References" >[18]  </A>.
Further information on this topic can also be located on the WWW
by searching under 'sensitivity analysis'.
<P>
A common starting point is the textbook by Box et al. on design
of experiments <A HREF="#References" >[1]  </A>. The use of experimental
design in simulation was initiated by Naylor in 1969 <A HREF="#References" >[14]  
</A>. Several textbooks on simulation introducing classical techniques
are also available <A HREF="#References" >[9,11]  </A>. More sophisticated
and also recent techniques are published in the following journals:

<P>
This list is not at all comprehensive but few are read by building
physics practitioners. It is very difficult to keep track of what
is going on in secondary subjects, especially in statistics because
the vocabulary is sometimes different, and extracting practical
information is not straightforward. Key papers are surveys of
the subject by J.C. Helton, T. Turanyi or J. Kleijnen which contain
many valuable pointers <A HREF="#References" >[7,20,13]  </A>.
<P>
As part of IEA Annex 23 'Multizone air flow modelling', an important
effort was targeted on the problem of simulation confidence. This
addressed experimental as well as user-introduced uncertainty.
The final report contains theoretical points, techniques and several
case studies <A HREF="#References" >[2,5]  </A>, thus representing
a good introduction to the subject of sensitivity analysis for
ventilation practitioners.
<H2><A NAME="MISA">MISA </A>(Multirun Interface for Sensitivity
Analysis)</H2>

<P>
In practice tools are needed which are efficient but at the same
time are good tutorials. One such tool, known as MISA (Multirun
Interface for Sensitivity Analysis) is currently being developed
at NIST. It is a Windows version of a tool developed as part of
Annex 23. The aim of this software is to provide practitioners
with a way to use up-to-date statistical methods for simulation
and to allow them to perform a sensitivity analysis within a couple
of hours. MISA is designed for encapsulating a DOS or a UNIX modelling
program that works in batch mode with unformatted input and output
file(s). The computation procedure follows <A HREF="#References" >[4]  
</A>:
<OL>
<LI>The project file (the input file representing the project
under study) is flagged to point the parameters to be studied
and becomes a reference file.
<LI>The ranges of the parameters to be varied are entered.
<LI>Depending on the type of statistical method to be used, a
design consisting of a special matrix of standardized values is
selected. The design matrix has one line per simulation run and
one row per parameter to be varied.
<LI>A new input file is generated by processing the reference
file, the range information and a line of the design matrix. The
new input file is run.
<LI>Step 4 is repeated as many times as necessary to complete
the design.
<LI>Numerical treatments such as mean, standard deviations and
correlation coefficients or meta-model regression are applied
to the output to extract the sensitivity indices or uncertainty
information related to the selected statistical technique.
</OL>

<P>
The general idea of the interface (see <A HREF="#Figure_1" >Figure 1  
</A>) is to represent the flow of information during the multirun
process and, within this scheme, to provide the user with tools
to perform analyses. The graphical interface, making the structure
evident, gives the user easy access to the multirun facility,
and he can then spend more effort on the statistical strategy
to follow and the analysis of the results.<BR>

<P>
<I><A NAME="Figure_1">Figure 1</A>: Main window of MISA (Multirun
Interface for Sensitivity Analysis). It is a graphical representation
of the flow of information during the procedure. The user enters
commands through push buttons and pop-up menus which are placed
into the scheme according to their influence. Help windows are
available which explain the main point of each step of the procedure
</I>.
<H2><A NAME="Conclusions">
<IMG SRC="model.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM" >
Conclusions</A></H2>

<P>
Simulation work should incorporate a sensitivity analysis indicating
the confidence limits of output data. This can be done efficiently
by using up-to-date statistical techniques as it is done in others
fields. There are many such techniques, and a statistical handbook
for simulation could be of great help.
<P>
Sensitivity Analysis must be considered when developing models
and user interfaces as well as when beginning a new study. To
assist this approach, MISA will be available very soon.
<P>

version of MISA under evaluation.

<H3>Martin Liddament reviews two recently completed air flow annexes
</H3>

<H2>Introduction</H2>

<P>
Ultimately, the quality of indoor air and thus the health of occupants
is dependent on the interaction and mixing behaviour of pollutants
with clean air. In addition, the heating and refrigerative cooling
of a space is exceptionally energy intensive with the result that
unnecessary or uncontrolled air flow from buildings still results
in a largely undefinable but significant proportion of total energy
loss. Only by continuing to develop measurement and calculation
techniques, and by producing practitioner tools, can energy efficient
solutions to indoor environmental problems be achieved.
<P>
In its strategy plan for 1994 to 1997, the IEA Executive Committee
for <A HREF="http://www.ecbcs.org/" >Energy Conservation in Buildings and Community Systems
</A> (ECBCS) concluded that ventilation and air movement will
become the dominant heat and cooling loss mechanism in buildings
of the next century. Its impact on global energy use will also
increase substantially. Thus a goal was established to determine
indoor air quality and optimal ventilation needs and to identify
alternative energy efficient strategies to control the indoor
environment. In support of this, various research annexes were
established including:
<UL>
<LI>Annex 23 Multi-Zone Air Flow Modelling
<LI>Annex 26 Energy Efficient Ventilation of Large Enclosures
</UL>

<P>
These annexes have now been completed and the results were presented
at the recent Roomvent Conference held in Yokohama, Japan on 17th-19th
July 1996. A review of the outcome is summarised below.
<H2><A HREF="http://www.ecbcs.org/annex23.html" >Annex 23 Multi-Zone Air Flow Modelling (COMIS)
</A></H2>

<H3>Background and Objectives</H3>

<P>
Having its origins as a year long international workshop held
at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in California, the 'Conjunction
Of Multizone Infiltration Specialists' (COMIS) became adopted
as IEA Annex 23 in 1992. The Operating Agent responsible for the
development and management of this task is Dr Helmut Feustel of
the Energy and Environment Division of the LBL. Its focus was
to develop a new multi-zone (inter-room) air flow and pollutant
transport model. In support of this, the task also involved the
most comprehensive evaluation of such models ever attempted. This
activity attracted the co-operation of researchers from nine countries,
it included the intercomparison of many existing models and involved
measurements made in more than a dozen buildings and structures.
While currently not widely used, multi-zone models are invaluable
for predicting the pattern of air flow and pollutant migration
throughout an entire building. They have also been applied to
the prediction of air flow in a single enclosed space (Annex 26).
Further applications include evaluating the performance of ventilation
systems, identifying the impact on air flow and air change rate
of window or vent opening, and predicting flow rates in mechanical
or natural ventilation ducts. Additionally, they may be coupled
to thermal models to provide a much more accurate evaluation of
heat loss and temperature distribution than is possible by simply
assuming a fixed air change rate or ventilation duty cycle.
<H3>The Tasks</H3>

<P>
Tasks included:
<UL>
<LI>devising a robust algorithm incorporating the fundamental
features of interzonal air and pollutant flow.
<LI>developing a user friendly interface.
<LI>evaluating the algorithm for numerical reliability.
<LI>evaluating potential user difficulties.
<LI>comparing numerical prediction with experimental data.
</UL>

<H3>The Algorithm</H3>

<P>
COMIS is designed to solve a network of equations representing
air flow between individual rooms or zones within a building and
between the inside and outside of a building. It is modular in
concept and contains algorithms to handle many flow problems including
flow through cracks, large openings, vertical openings, ductwork
and natural and mechanical ventilation systems. It also evaluates
pollutant migration and pressure distribution. In principle, further
modules covering other aspects may be added as the need arises.
Mass air flow rates are solved for known air path distributions
and for mechanical and natural driving forces.
<H3>The User Interface</H3>

<P>
Two user interfaces have been developed to aid the input of data.
The first, 'COMERL', is DOS based and has been developed at EMPA
in Switzerland as a simple tool to complement COMIS. The second
is a totally interactive Windows based graphical interface, 'IISIBat'
which has been developed at the Centre Scientifique et Technique
du Batiment (CSTB), France. This latter version introduces considerable
transparency into the operation of COMIS and very much relieves
the user of the need to understand the COMIS program. Both interfaces
have provision for 'default' information, including data from
the AIVC's <A HREF="numdb.html" >Numerical Database</A>.<BR>

<P>
<I>COMIS IISIBat Graphical User Interface</I>
<P>

<IMG SRC="s10.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM" >

<H3>Numerical Reliability</H3>

<P>
A variety of tests were introduced to ensure that the program
contained no numerical errors and would provide the same results
irrespective of computer or operating system. This included 'User
Test 1' which was developed as part of a joint contribution by
the AIVC and LESO in Lausanne, Switzerland. This test represented
a very simple network in which all openings and driving forces
were defined and extreme parameters were set, aimed at establishing
the ability of the algorithm to converge to a consistent solution
under all possible conditions. This and other numerical tests,
which compared results with known solutions, enabled inconsistencies
and problems in the code to be quickly identified and rectified.
<H3>Evaluating Potential User Difficulties</H3>

<P>
A further test, 'User Test 2', was developed to evaluate the ability
of the user to interpret input data and apply the data to a multi-zone
model. Judgement was needed on the specification of items such
as the number and location of flow paths, leakage coefficients,
and wind pressure distribution. This approach pinpointed potential
difficulties and highlighted further explanations that were needed
in the COMIS User Guide. Results also showed that the ability
of the user was critical in securing reliable predictions.
<H3>Comparing Numerical Predictions with Experimental Data</H3>

<P>
Ultimately the performance of a model can only be judged against
its ability to compare favourably with reliably measured results.
A comprehensive measurement programme and data sensitivity analysis
was therefore undertaken. This included a mix of real buildings
and test structures, with each being used to focus on a different
aspect of multi-zone air flow. When compared against measurement
data, numerical predictions were found to be generally of the
correct magnitude, although there were sometimes significant differences
in individual results. Much still depends on the interpretation
placed on the input data by the user and there are clearly uncertainties
over assigning wind pressure and air leakage data. Extensive testing
has shown, however, that the algorithm itself is error free and
accurately solves the basic flow equations.
<H3>Outcome and Conclusions</H3>

<P>
The main development of this annex has been the production of
the COMIS model which is available in the public domain as a stand
alone 'FORTRAN' Code. This has been thoroughly evaluated using
a wide range of measurement data. Also available in the public
domain is the Swiss interactive input algorithm, COMERL. Following
further testing, the full Windows environment interface, IISIBat,
will be available as a commercial product from CSTB in France.
<P>
Effort is still needed to improve the accuracy and transparency
of input data. Nevertheless, provided the user is familiar with
the implications of input data and has a good concept of the source
and flow characteristics of openings and driving forces, the COMIS
Model is capable of making a positive contribution to ventilation
design and pollutant prediction.

<H2><A HREF="http://www.les.iet.ethz.ch/annex26/annex26.html" >Annex 26 Air Flow in Large Enclosures
</A></H2>

<H3>Background and Objectives</H3>

<P>
Large enclosed spaces are becoming a feature of modern architecture
and are evolving in response to consumer expectations. Examples
include shopping malls, atria buildings, airport terminals and
covered sports stadia. Each presents enormous design problems
in relation to heating and cooling loads, the provision of good
air quality, and protection against smoke and fire movement. Without
modern computational and measurement techniques, it is arguable
that such buildings could not be constructed to an acceptable
level of energy and environmental performance. Many spectacular
buildings have now been designed and constructed on the basis
of computational fluid dynamic analysis combined with physical
scale modelling. However, as more designers wish to follow this
route, it has become critical to ensure that these design techniques
are correctly applied. A complete understanding of the implications
of these methods is needed to avoid the risk of fundamental mistakes
or to prevent too much reliance being placed on simulated predictions.
Annex 26 was conceived to investigate the potential pitfalls and
provide design guidance on the application of measurement and
computational tools for understanding air flow patterns in large
enclosures. The Operating Agent and Co-ordinater is Dr Alfred
Moser of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, ETH, Zurich.
Typical building sizes included in this study vary from approximately
1000 m3 to over 100,000 m3. These are essentially buildings in
which thermal effects dominate and in which the occupied zones
are small compared to the total enclosed volume.
<H3>The Tasks</H3>

<P>
Tasks included:
<UL>
<LI>developing design guidance and producing a design principles
guide
<LI>documenting and assessing analysis and prediction techniques
<LI>documenting design case studies of existing large enclosures
</UL>

<H3>The Design Principles Guide</H3>

<P>
The design principles guide provides recommendations and advice
for the planning of ventilation and air distribution systems in
large enclosures. It focuses on information specific to the needs
of such spaces, especially where this may differ from more conventional
buildings. Particular aspects cover meeting ventilation, comfort,
air quality and safety needs as well as energy implications, ventilation
strategies, design techniques, applications, commissioning and
feedback. Included in the Guide are worked examples, information
on selecting ventilation rates, and advice on design parameters
and strategy selection.
<H3>Analysis and Prediction Techniques</H3>

<P>
Measurement and calculation methods form a vital part of the design
and evaluation process. Methods are evolving rapidly and some
of the most up-to-date techniques (both elementary and complex),
as currently used by researchers and specialists, are reviewed.
The relevance of each approach within the context of the design,
construction and evaluation process is considered. Design begins
with 'macroscopic' methods based on engineering experience and
simple analytical tools. As development continues, more sophisticated
techniques are often necessary. Examples look at individual flow
element models, zonal models (where the air space of a single
room is subdivided into a relatively small number of zones or
layers), computational fluid dynamics, physical (scale) models,
ventilation efficiency evaluation and, ultimately, commissioning
and evaluation measurements.
<H3>Case Studies</H3>

<P>
To support the analytical and design guide development, a total
of twenty six case study buildings were monitored. Of these, seven
reference case study buildings were selected for detailed measurements.
These were two university auditoriums (De Montfort University,
United Kingdom, 870 m3, and Torino Polytechnic, Italy), an experimental
1/5th scale model atrium (Japan, 135 m3), two sports halls (Norway,
128,340 m3, and Germany, 2,230 m3), a factory unit (France, 8,820
m3) and a large atrium office building (Switzerland, 20 m high).
Measurements included ventilation rates, air and surface temperature
distribution, air velocity distribution and outdoor weather conditions
(e.g. temperature and wind velocity). In most cases, thermal transfer,
temperature and air flow velocity distributions were compared
with various computational fluid dynamics and other modelling
approaches.
<H3>Outcome and Results</H3>

<P>
The work of this team, both as <A HREF="http://www.les.iet.ethz.ch/annex26/annex26.html" >Annex 26
</A> and formerly <A HREF="http://www.ecbcs.org/annex20.html" >Annex 20
</A>, has consistently produced simple guidance to assist in the
reliable use of computational modelling and measurement techniques.
This particular study has developed and perfected new methods
and has provided new guidance on the operational needs and applicability
of computational fluid dynamics models.
<P>
'Simple' analysis tools intended for basic engineering application
include the 'flow element' technique in which the total flow field
is predicted by analysing each element of flow, i.e. jets, plumes,
boundary layer flow etc., individually. Similarly a simplified
measurement procedure to evaluate building air leakage has been
devised, aimed at identifying the position of the neutral pressure
plane. This has been successfully applied to identify unexpected
sources of air leakage in an enclosure.
<P>
At the more complex level, the performance of computational fluid
dynamics models has been compared with measurement results. This
has demonstrated the potential to predict flow and thermal patterns,
to a reasonable degree of accuracy, especially as measured in
the well instrumented Japanese test atrium. A zonal model, in
which the space was discretised into control volumes, was also
able to give a good prediction of thermal stratification. Important
discoveries and conclusions concerning the use of computational
fluid dynamics models include:
<UL>
<LI>Conventional computational fluid dynamics approaches incorporating
k-e type turbulence representation were found to be capable of
giving reliable prediction results for temperature, air velocity
and pollutant fields.
<LI>Small changes to boundary conditions may significantly affect
the main pattern of air flow and temperature distribution. It
was therefore essential that boundary conditions were accurately
represented. The extra effort expended to obtain realistic data
is of proven value.
<LI>Radiative heat transfer is a sensitive component of energy
transport and must be incorporated in any computational fluid
dynamics analysis.
<LI>Convective heat transfer from boundaries to the air were not
reliably predicted using coarse grid systems and log law wall
functions. Results tended to be grid spacing dependent. The use
of prescribed convective heat transfer coefficients were proposed
instead, although it was acknowledged that this might not always
be easy. New wall functions for free-convection heat transfer
are now being developed by Annex 26 participants, and the application
of these functions are presently being tried out.
<LI>Slow or non-existant convergence of the solution procedure
was found in some instances. This tends to occur when flow is
dominated by free convection forces (i.e. thermal buoyancy). It
was demonstrated that this problem could be overcome by using
a 'coupled' rather than a conventional 'sequential' (SIMPLE) solver.
In addition, instability in solutions was found in an isothermal
calculation of the air jets in the sports hall in Germany. It
is believed that the physical flow exhibits low-frequency oscillations.
It is concluded that such flows may only be modelled by time-dependent
computation. A steady-state model will never converge.

<H2><A NAME="Synopsis">Synopsis</A></H2>

<P>
A computer program named &quot;Cp Generator&quot;, has been developed
to predict the wind pressure coefficients, Cp, on the facades
and roofs of block shaped buildings.
<P>
The program is based on fits of measured data, including wind
shielding by obstacles and terrain roughness.
<P>
The main advantages of the program are:
<UL>
<LI>it needs no expertise in wind pressures;
<LI>the input is simple. It exists of building and obstacle coordinates
and orientations;
<LI>generating Cp values for ventilation model calculations needs
no separate action. By linking the pressure simulation program
and the ventilation calculation program as well as their input,
wider application of ventilation programs for non-experts becomes
possible.
</UL>

<P>
The accuracy of the predicted wind pressures in the first version
of the pressure simulation program is promising. Some development
is still needed, however, in particular complex building shapes
and surroundings have to be dealt with more carefully, as well
as increasing wind velocities in small passages. Detailed improvements
are also necessary, for example, to account for sloped roofs and
the position of ventilation provisions above roof level.
<P>
Consequently, generation and implementation of additional wind
tunnel data is planned, to improve the present version of the
program.
<H2>1. <A NAME="Introduction">Introduction</A></H2>

<P>
A good prediction of wind pressure coefficients, Cp, on facades
and roofs with ventilation provision, is vital for natural ventilation
calculations. The accuracy of the ventilation calculations can
highly depend on it, if wind is the dominant driving force.
<P>
The use of wind tunnel experiments to predict Cp values is a proven,
but expensive method. The use of Cp estimations from data bases
is a cheaper, but less accurate alternative and in the case of
surrounding obstacles almost impossible.
<P>
In both methods, generating Cp-values is an expert job, to be
performed separately, before the actual ventilation calculations.
This is found to be a disadvantage for operating applications
with ventilation models by non-expert users.
<P>
The organisation for applied scientific research TNO is developing
an automatic control system for natural ventilation of industrial
buildings for the Dutch ventilation company BRAKEL-ATMOS. The
control system calculates and sets optimum grill positions, depending
on meteo conditions, inside temperature, required ventilation
flow and allowable draught.
<P>
For this application the need for implicit prediction of wind
pressure coefficients became urgent. Due to the knowledge of most
of its users, the input needs to be simple data of the building
to be ventilated and its surroundings.
<P>
The lack of such a tool led to the development of the first version
of a wind pressure simulation program, described in this paper.
<P>
The pressure simulation program is a computer program, written
in Pascal and running under MS-DOS.
<P>
The pressure simulation program may be applied for:
<UL>
<LI>simple building structures (to be simplified to rectangular
shaped facades with flat roofs);
<LI>with ventilation provisions on variable position within the
facades and roof;
<LI>in different surroundings per orientation;
<LI>with common terrain roughnesses (z0 = 0.35 to 7 m);
<LI>and several local obstacles (also more or less block shaped).
</UL>

<H2>2. <A NAME="Basics">Basics</A> Of The Program</H2>

<P>
The pressure simulation program is based on measured data <A HREF="#References" >[1], [2]
</A>. It concerns wind tunnel experiments:
<UL>
<LI>on typical block shaped buildings,
<LI>in different terrain roughnesses,
<LI>with and without obstacles on systematically varying distances.
</UL>

<P>
Because of the systematic set-up of these measurements, it was
possible to fit the data to a set of mathematical expressions.
For parameters describing the data additional references <A HREF="#References" >[3], [4] and [5]
</A> are applied.
<P>
The start of the fits is a formula, describing the general relation
of wind pressure and wind direction for an unshielded object.
The relation is presented by different researchers (<A HREF="#References" >Phaff [1], Walker and Wilson [4]
</A> and ASHRAE).
<P>
With a set of additional formulas, containing the building dimensions
and the terrain roughness as relevant parameters, the wind pressures
on different spots of the roof and each facade are predicted.
<P>
The next stage was to add the influence of nearby obstacles.
<P>
For the main orientation of each obstacle to the building, a correction
on the unshielded Cp was determined, using both the distance between
obstacle and building and the leeward side Cp of the obstacle
itself. The obstacle leeward Cp was calculated using the same
procedure as used for the unshielded building, but now using of
course the obstacle dimensions.
<P>
After calculating the Cp correction for the main obstacle direction,
the correction for surrounding directions is determined, using
the &quot;shielding angle&quot; of the obstacle to the building.
<P>
To ease the use of the program, a set of formulas has been added,
calculating input parameters like dimensions and angles from a
minimum of building and obstacle coordinates, to be entered by
the user.
<H2>3. Program <A NAME="Input">Input</A></H2>

<P>
To allow the program to be used by non-experts, the input is restricted
to measurable dimensions of the building, nearby obstacles and
their positions.
<P>
To prevent a time consuming, over-detailed input, a simple instruction
points out what kind of details are relevant. An example is the
criteria for obstacles further away than 5 x their height. These
are not considered to be of importance for the local shielding
but may contribute to the terrain roughness.
<P>
An example of a part of the input is given in the text block and
the building lay-out (<A HREF="#Figure1" >Figure 1</A>).<BR>

<P>
For the output example shown, a data set of wind-tunnel Cp values
is available. The data set has proved to fit well with actual
on-site measurements.
<P>
A comparison of these data and the Cp-values calculated with the
pressure simulation program is presented in <A HREF="#Figure3" >Figure 3
</A>, <A HREF="#Figure4" >Figure 4</A> and <A HREF="#Figure5" >Figure 5

<P>
<EM><A NAME="Figure3">Figure 3</A>: Comparison measured and calculated
Cp for the front facade.</EM>
<P>
The comparison shows a rather good agreement for both facades.
Most remarkable in these characteristics is the change of calculated
windward into leeward pressures happening too fast. An over-estimation
of the contraction effect (under-estimation of the velocity increase)
in the case of small passages is held responsible for this.
<P>

<IMG SRC="pc5.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM" >

<P>
<EM><A NAME="Figure4">Figure 4</A>: Comparison measured and calculated
Cp for the rear facade</EM>
<P>
The comparison for the roof pressure shows a worse agreement,
especially for wind directions between 180&#186; and 330&#186;.
The slope of the roof and the position of the ventilation duct
within the roof is held responsible for this difference. The pressure
simulation program doesn't account for sloped roofs yet.
<P>
One should realise that a rather preliminary tool is used and
that a rather complex configuration of obstacles is concerned.
<P>

<IMG SRC="pc6.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM" >

<P>
<EM><A NAME="Figure5">Figure 5</A>: Comparison measured and calculated
Cp for the roof pitch</EM>
<P>
Also, one should realise that minor differences in Cp, especially
over a wind direction sector, and at steep changes, will have
less effect in reality. This is due to normal fluctuations of
the actual wind direction. Therefore the results of the comparison
are considered to be hopeful. If some essential corrections are
added, the pressure simulation program is expected to be a useful
tool. Hence, further development of the tool is recommended.
<H2>6. <A NAME="Future">Future</A> Improvements</H2>

<P>
To end up with a useful and sufficiently accurate pressure simulation
program, improvements are recommended on:
<UL>
<LI>complex building shapes (non-block shaped, like sloped roofs,
building extensions or combined obstacles, sloped surfaces, seasonal
corrections for vegetation);
<LI>contraction effects depending on passage width.
</UL>

<P>
Apart from this, extracting a version for correction of local
meteo data is recommended. When local meteo data is used to control
ventilation, the correction for local effects is often poor. This
badly affects ventilation control. The obstacle corrections of
the pressure simulation program may also be utilised to correct
these data.

<H2>Support for Energy Saving Measures in Germany</H2>

<H3>from Gunther Mertz, FGK, Germany</H3>

<P>
The German Government aims to reduce the energy consumption and
subsequently the carbon dioxide emissions in the residential sector
by giving financial incentives.
<P>
The following measures are to be supported:
<P>
a) The installation of solar systems, heat pumps and heat recovery
systems in new buildings as well as in the building stock. The
bonus will amount to two per cent of the basis assessment but
not more than 500 Marks per year over a period of eight years.
The bonus will be granted for measures that are completed by January
1st, 1999.
<P>
b) The construction of a low energy house with the heat energy
requirements being less than 75 per cent of the requirements according
to the 1995 Heat Transfer Barrier Act (&quot;Waermeschutz- verordnung&quot;,
WSVO). Here, the bonus will amount to 400 Marks per year over
a period of eight years and will be granted for houses to be finished
by January 1st, 1999. In this way, clients fulfilling the conditions
as mentioned above can be granted an additional bonus of up to
7200 Marks.<HR>

<H2>European Project on Natural Ventilation Inaugurated</H2>

<P>
A new natural ventilation project, &quot;NATVENT&quot; has been
inaugurated with the aim of overcoming technical barriers to low-energy
natural ventilation in office-type buildings in moderate and cold
climates. The programme falls within the European Joule programme
and will be coordinated by the UK Building Research Establishment.
<P>
The main objective of this proposal is to reduce primary energy
consumption in buildings (and consequently CO2 emissions) by encouraging
the use of natural ventilation as the main design option for office
type buildings in moderate and cold countries. It is intended
for countries with low winter and moderate summer temperatures
and where summer overheating from solar and internal gain can
be significantly reduced by good natural ventilation. It also
addresses the need to find good natural ventilation solutions
to buildings in those urban areas where external air pollution
and noise are problems.

<H2><A NAME="Introduction">Introduction</A></H2>

<P>
In the frame of the European standardization work, an ad hoc group
of CEN TC 156, WG2 'Mechanical and natural powered residential
ventilation', is presently working out calculation methods for
the determination of air flow rates for dwellings. A first draft
standard has been prepared and is currently under revision by
the working group and experts of the national CEN shadow committees.
Since the draft with its annexes is rather comprehensive, this
article summarizes only roughly the basic assumptions and the
methods developed so far, without giving the definitions and equations
in detail. For this, the reader is referred to the <A HREF="#References" >draft standard  
</A>.
<H2><A NAME="Content">Content</A> of the draft standard</H2>

<P>
In the draft standard, methods are presented to calculate air
flows for the whole dwelling as well as room air flow rates, both
for single family houses and individual apartments. The methods
may be used for applications such as energy loss calculations,
heat load calculations and indoor air quality evaluations. Natural
as well as mechanical extract and balanced ventilation systems
are considered. Flows due to window opening are also considered,
but only as a single sided effect (no cross ventilation). Depending
on the application and the building type, only outdoor air flow
rates or both outdoor and internal flows are considered. For these
different applications, the same basic methods apply. Nevertheless
the input parameter values have to be selected according to the
requirements set out for the specific application. Informative
annexes of the standard provide
<P>
a) a selection of input data (such as leakage values, wind pressure
coefficients) and guidance for the selection of climatic data
as well as window opening factors
<P>
b) calculation examples for both single and multifamily houses
as well as comparison with results from measurements and calculation
with single and multizone models
<P>
c) a bibliography.
<H2><A NAME="Input">Input</A> data</H2>

<P>
The input data needed for the three calculation methods are largely
identical. Information on the following main aspects of the building,
the dwelling under consideration, the ventilation system and the
external conditions is needed to use the methods outlined in the
draft standard:
<P>
Building and dwelling:
<UL>
<LI>the type of building
<LI>the building height
<LI>the shielding from the wind
<LI>the number of facades of the dwelling which are exposed to
wind
<LI>the air leakage of the dwelling
<LI>the distribution of the air leakage over the envelope
</UL>

<P>
Ventilation system:
<UL>
<LI>the type of system (natural, mechanical extract or mechanical
balanced system)
<LI>the capacity of the ventilation system
</UL>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
- natural ventilation openings
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
- mechanical flows
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<UL>
<LI>the time these provisions are assumed to be used
</UL>

<P>
Finally the climatic data have to be known.
<H2>Calculation method for whole <A NAME="house">house</A> air
flow rates</H2>

<P>
For the determination of the whole house air flow rates, two methods
are given.
<P>
The first method is an explicit method. This means that if all
the input data are known one can carry out the calculation procedure
step by step.
<P>
The second method is the implicit method. This method is based
on a single zone model using a simple flow balance equation that
has to be solved iteratively for the unknown internal pressure.
This solving process normally requires a computer. The advantage
of this method is that the interactions between the wind induced
flow, the stack induced flow and the flows from the mechanical
system are considered correctly. Due to the nonlinearity of these
interactions, the explicit method needs many empirical and approximative
factors to characterize these interaction effects.
<P>
The methods given must be declared as <U>simplified methods </U>when
comparing them e.g. to multizone air flow models available today.
<H3>The explicit method</H3>

<P>
It is assumed, that the air flow is dominated by a single leakage
and that across this leakage there is an effective pressure difference,
which is a summation of windward and leeward pressures. The internal
pressure is assumed to be close to the leeward side pressure.
<P>
Default values for wind pressure coefficients, valid for a wind
sector of approximately 60 degrees to the facade axis, are given
in the standard . The wind direction is not considered more specifically.
<P>
The basic procedure for the calculation is shown in Figure 1.
The total flow is composed of additive flow terms accounting for
the natural flows, the flows of the mechanical system, the flows
due to airing and combustion appliances, and, for apartments,
also for internal flows.
<P>
 
<P>

<IMG SRC="cen_fig.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM" >

<P>
Figure 1
<P>
 
<P>
Natural flows due to stack and wind are calculated separately
for leakage and purpose provided openings as a powerlaw function
of the flow coefficient and the pressure. For both stack and wind
induced infiltration flows, an additional factor accounts for
the leakage distribution effects. Ducts are considered for stack
pressures of both infiltration and purpose provided flows.
<P>
For mechanical extract and balanced systems respectively, the
interaction with the natural flows is considered.
<P>
Airing is treated as a single sided, single room ventilation effect
through open window and doors. Cross-ventilation effects are not
considered.
<P>
Combustion induced flows are determined by a factor which accounts
for the fact that a certain proportion of the natural or extract
flow may be used to cover the additional flow needed for the combustion
process, by a factor which considers whether the combustion air
flow is separated from the room (closed system) or not, by the
specific air flow per fuel type needed for the combustion process
and the proportion of time the combustion appliance is activated.
<P>
For the determination of the internal flow in an apartment, information
on the leakage distribution and thus on neutral pressure level
in the staircase is necessary.
<P>
Open/closed ducts and windows, and intermittent operation of the
mechanical system are all considered in the resulting flow by
time weighted addition of the respective flows.
<H3>The implicit method</H3>

<P>
This method is based on a single zone model. This means that the
dwelling is represented by one zone with one temperature and one
pressure value. This zone pressure value has to be determined
iteratively based on a flow balance equation for all flows entering
and leaving this zone. The model is based on the same input parameters
as needed for the explicit method. Nevertheless, individual leakage
values for the facades and the roof have to be determined as percentages
of the overall leakage. Guidance for the selection of cp-coefficient
values at the external nodes is given in an annex of the draft
standard.
<P>
In order to model stack driven flows correctly, distributed leaks
may be modelled by two individual, vertically separated leakages.
This is especially important for natural systems with no vertical
duct.
<P>
The building can be modelled in a more complex way, taking into
account more than two facades. In this case though, the relevant
information on the leakage and wind pressure distribution must
be available. The implicit method can also be applied to apartment
building types.
<P>
Besides the unknown pressure in the zone under consideration,
also the pressure in the staircase is unknown. Therefore, this
building type is normally treated using multizone air flow models.
Nevertheless, two extreme cases can be calculated using the method
in the standard: a) The staircase is not considered as a part
of the building, b) The staircase is considered as a part of the
zone (pstaircase = pzone). Flows for both cases must be calculated
and the results be considered according to the specific application.
<H2>Calculation method for <A NAME="room">room</A> air flow rates
</H2>

<P>
The method gives total flow rates for an individual room in the
dwelling. To perform the calculations, the whole dwelling flows
must be determined first, using the methods outlined above.
<P>
It is assumed that the internal doors to the room under investigation
are closed. More than one room may be considered as one zone if
the internal partitions are removed or the connecting doors open.
<P>
The calculation procedure is applicable to heat load calculations
only, giving conservative high flow rate values.
<P>
For indoor air quality evaluations, information on internal flows
is needed that can only be determined by multizone modelling.
For energy calculations, room air flow values are not considered
to be relevant.

<P>
Lattice gas methods have been devised to assist in understanding
the properties of real fluids. Potentially, therefore, they could
provide an alternative to conventional computational fluid dynamic
(CFD) analysis for predicting air flow patterns. This new approach
approximates reality by constraining motions and collisions of
fluid 'particles' to a 'lattice', where each particle represents
a finite mass of fluid. Simplification takes place by reducing
the near infinite motion characteristics of a real fluid to a
very restricted set of discrete particle speeds and directions.
<P>
A typical lattice for flow in 2-dimensions is illustrated in Figure
1. Particles are restricted to moving along propagation lines
and collide only at the intersections ('nodes') of these lines.
Each collision must observe Newton's laws of motion, namely that
momentum and mass are conserved. Various outcomes of particle
collisions are possible. In some cases the direction of particle
flow changes, while in others no change in direction occurs. Typically,
the solution algorithm incorporates a 'look-up table', in which
all the possible outcomes of collisions are stored.
<P>

<P>
<I>Figure 1 Example hexagonal lattice</I>
<P>
This article presents an example of the application of the lattice
gas approach, and outlines some of the essential concepts. The
example is based on a method proposed by <A HREF="#Frisch" >Frisch, Hasslacher, and Pomeau (1986)  
</A>, known as an FHP model.
<H2>Lattice <A NAME="Geometry">Geometry</A></H2>

<P>
A highly symmetric lattice is needed to ensure that vorticity
(rotational motion of a fluid) is realistically simulated. <A HREF="#Hardy" >Hardy et al (1972, 1973, 1976)  
</A>showed that a basic rectangular lattice is inadequate for
this purpose. However, <A HREF="#Frisch" >Frisch et al (1986)  
</A>concluded that for flow in 2-dimensions, a hexagonal lattice,
illustrated in Figure 1, is satisfactory. Three-dimensional flow
is more difficult to model, but has been simulated using a 'face
centred hyper-cubic' (FCHC) lattice. (See <A HREF="#Rivet" >Frisch et al, 1987  
</A>.) Although particles must move along the propagation lines,
the velocity (i.e. speed and direction) components can nevertheless
be resolved to generate the full flow field.
<P>
Analogous to wind tunnel experiments, lattice flow has to be scaled
to correspond to the correct flow regime (i.e. laminar, transitional,
or turbulent flow). This is characterised by the Reynolds number.
By increasing the number of nodes, and hence the Reynolds number,
features such as the onset and development of turbulence automatically
emerge. A disadvantage is that turbulent flow currently requires
many thousands of nodes.
<H2><A NAME="_Toc337880800"></A><A NAME="Collision"></A>Collision
Rules</H2>

<P>
A set of collision rules must be specified. These fall into the
categories of 'trivial' collisions, which result in no change
in direction of colliding particles, and 'non-trivial' collisions,
involving a change of direction of some or all of the particles.
Collisions throughout the entire lattice are assumed to occur
simultaneously and at 'unit' time steps. Following collision,
they then arrive at their new nodes. The resultant propagation
of particles simulates the movement of fluid throughout the space.
<P>
In 2 dimensions, using an FHP model, there are 64 possibilities
for a collision at each node. The outcome of each possible collision
is chosen so that the number of particles present before and after
is preserved. In addition, the total of the momenta of all the
particles involved remains constant. The number of particles and
the momentum should be the only conserved quantities in any collision.
As a consequence, some collisions result in more than one outcome.
When this happens, the outcome is selected at random. The complete
set of non-trivial collision rules, as proposed by <A HREF="#Hénon" >Hénon (1987)  
</A>, is given as follows, and results in up to 72 distinct outcomes:
<OL>
<LI>head-on (2 particles) - 3 possibilities, each with 2 possible
outcomes (see Figure 2a),
<LI>triple (3 particles) - 2 possibilities, each with 2 possible
outcomes (including 1 trivial, see Figure 2b),
<LI>head-on with spectator (3 particles) - 12 possibilities, each
with 1 possible outcome (see Figure 2c), and
</OL>

<OL>
<LI>binary head-on (4 particle) - 3 possibilities, each with 2
possible outcomes (see Figure 2d).
</OL>

<P>

<H2><A NAME="Boundaries">Boundaries</A></H2>

<P>
Perimeter obstructions to flow (e.g. walls, floors, and ceilings)
and internal obstructions (e.g. furniture and people) are realised
by setting 'solid boundary nodes'. Implementing the condition
of 'no-slip' (i.e. zero parallel fluid velocity) at such boundaries
is illustrated in Figure 3. On reaching a solid surface, particles
are returned along the same propagation line.
<P>

<P>
<I>Figure 3 Implementation of no-slip condition at solid boundaries
</I>
<P>
Flow boundaries (e.g. open doors, windows, ventilation systems)
are represented by a variety of means. For example, it is possible
to introduce 'forcing rules' to simulate a linear pressure gradient,
as shown in Figure 4. This involves imposing directional flow
on the lattice particles by introducing additional <I>x</I>-momentum
at random lattice locations. The strength of pressure gradient
is increased by adding to the number of nodes and the number of
time steps at which forcing is applied. The mass flow rate into
the space (i.e. the number of particles entering the lattice per
time step) must be balanced by an identical mass flow rate out
of the space.
<P>

<I>Figure 4 Forcing rules to simulate a pressure gradient</I>
<H2><A NAME="Interpretation">Interpretation</A> of Lattice Dynamics
</H2>

<P>
In order to convert the discrete motions of particles into physically
meaningful quantities, it is useful to partition the lattice into
a number of rectangular 'domains'. For each domain, the average
mass and momentum densities of particles must be determined. The
average mass density of particles is given by the number of particles
within a domain divided by the number of domain nodes. (For a
2-dimensional hexagonal lattice, the overall value should be between
0 and 3 particles per node, otherwise the fluid would have unphysical
behaviour.) The average momentum density is determined by summing
the spatial co-ordinate components of the momentum of all the
particles within a domain and, again, dividing by the number of
domain nodes. An evaluation of the average particle velocity within
each domain is then made from these quantities.
<P>
Viscosity is the resistance to flow that a fluid exerts on itself
when adjacent regions of the fluid move with different velocities.
For any lattice gas model, the viscosity and hence Reynolds number
of the fluid depends on the average mass density.
<H2><A NAME="Initialising">Initialising</A> a Simulation</H2>

<P>
The lattice must be sized to set the characteristic Reynolds number
of the problem to be studied. For this model, the maximum obtainable
Reynolds number for a given lattice size occurs when there is
an average of about 2.0 particles per node, for the complete set
of collision rules stated above. An initial particle distribution
defining the true mass density of the lattice is established.
This implies an initial momentum distribution, from which the
calculation proceeds by running the model over a number of unit
time steps.
<P>
In general, simulations must be run until transient disturbances
caused by the initial conditions have disappeared. This is likely
to be a large multiple (e.g. greater than 10) of the number of
time steps taken for a particle, moving at the average velocity,
to have 'propagated through the system'. At this stage a consistent
pattern of flow may begin to emerge.
<H2>An Air Flow <A NAME="Example">Example</A></H2>

<P>
The above concepts have been incorporated into a simplistic 2-dimensional
example, as illustrated in Figure 5. A 2-dimensional office space
is modelled using 400 x 400 lattice nodes, and 40 x 40 domains
(each of 10 x 10 lattice nodes). The average mass density of the
lattice is 2.4 particles per node, yielding low Reynolds number
flow.
<P>
The upper and lower boundaries are solid, and there is a no-slip
condition at these edges. Particles reaching one side of the lattice
are fed back into the other side, with identical velocity and
at the same <I>y</I>-value. A block of three adjacent solid rectangles
provides an internal obstacle to flow, which is a crude representation
of a person sitting at a desk. A no-slip condition is also present
at these boundaries.
<P>
The air flows under isothermal forced convection, as provided,
for example, by a balanced mechanical ventilation system. The
driving force for the flow is provided by a linear pressure gradient
(in the <I>x</I>-direction in Figure 5), implemented with the
forcing rules shown in Figure 4.
<P>
Figure 5 shows the resultant velocity field after 100000 unit
time steps (which required approximately 4 hours computation time
on a 100 MHz Intel Pentium based computer). It should be noted
that the Reynolds number is perhaps too low for a full-scale ventilation
system. Clearly, therefore, this example is very idealised, but
nevertheless the potential for predicting flow using this approach
is demonstrated.
<P>

<IMG SRC="lat_fig5.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM" >

<P>
<I>Figure 5 Example simulation</I>
<H2><A NAME="Conclusions">Conclusions</A></H2>

<P>
The lattice gas method presented may be used to produce qualitative
features of physical fluid behaviour. In the short term, the method
is likely to be limited to low Reynolds number applications. In
the longer term, current limitations imposed by the high storage
and processing requirements needed for turbulent flow analysis
must be overcome. This may be possible by compressing the data
stored to represent the lattice. Current work to overcome high
processing requirements includes using lattice models with parallel
computers (e.g. <A HREF="#Krafczyk" >Krafczyk and Rank, 1995  
</A>), to which they are well-suited.
<P>
The method has the positive characteristic that, subject to the
constraint of the discrete nature of the lattice, arbitrarily
complex boundaries can be included without increasing the time
needed for computations. It is also possible to track either individual
or groups of particles, so that, for instance, pollutant transport
may be studied. This approach dispenses with the need to solve
the Navier-Stokes equations. Furthermore, since turbulence develops
naturally in lattice gas methods, artificial turbulence models,
as incorporated into conventional CFD techniques, are unnecessary.
To conclude, the lattice gas technique may prove to be a useful
tool for air flow analysis, especially with recent developments
allowing for the inclusion of buoyancy effects (e.g. see <A HREF="#Chen" >Chen et al, 1989  
</A>, and <A HREF="#Burges" >Burges and Zaleski, 1987  </A>).

Richard Karney, Director of the Building Systems and Materials
Division at the <A HREF="http://www.doe.gov/" >US Department of Energy  
</A>, delivered the Welcome Address and introduced the Keynote
Speaker, Commissioner Jannane Sharpless from the <A HREF="http://www.energy.ca.gov/energy/" >California Energy Commission  
</A>, who spoke about the need for long-term public investment
to complement the research and development projects funded by
private industry.
<H3><A NAME="Energy">Energy Impact</A></H3>

<P>
Several presentations focused on energy consumption. The first
by Don Colliver (<A HREF="http://www.bae.uky.edu/" >University of Kentucky  
</A>, USA) outlined the results of a study to determine the energy
necessary to condition a fixed flow rate of outside air to various
heating and cooling set points. Later on, J&uuml;rgen R&ouml;ben,
of the <A href="http://www.uni-essen.de/" >Universit&aumlt Essen  
</A>in Germany, discussed the benefit of low energy dehumidification,
achieved with an open cycle liquid desiccant system, whilst Professor
Fritz Steimle, also from Essen, described how the separation of
sensible cooling from latent heat removal can allow a more energy
efficient system.
<H3><A NAME="Standards">Standards</A></H3>

<P>
A workshop on standardisation encouraged various speakers to give
an informal presentation on the current situations in their respective
countries. Codes and Standards were also the subject of several
papers delivered throughout the conference and included a presentation
by Gene Tucker (<A HREF="http://www.epa.gov/" >EPA  </A>, USA)
about the current revisions to <A HREF="http://www.ashrae.org/" >ASHRAE  
</A>Standard 62-1989 &quot;Ventilation for Acceptable Indoor Air
Quality&quot;. Also from the USA, Bud Offermann (Indoor Environmental
Engineering) demonstrated the procedure for an experimental evaluation
of <A HREF="http://www.ashrae.org/" >ASHRAE  </A>Standard 129
&quot;Standard Method of Measuring Air Change Effectiveness&quot;.
<H3><A NAME="Offices">Offices</A> and Large Enclosures</H3>

<P>
Measurements to determine ventilation effectiveness in four mechanically
ventilated New Zealand office buildings highlighted the importance
of planning the ventilation system around the floor layout. Continuing
with offices, Peter Wouters (BBRI, Belgium) described the installation
and operation of an infra-red (IR) detector controlled ventilation
system. It was shown that, provided attention was paid to duct
airtightness, then the IR detection facility can provide significant
energy savings. Elia Sterling (T.D.Sterling &amp; Assocs, Canada)
summarised the planning and design of some prototype energy efficient
offices, and Earle Perera (<A HREF="http://www.bre.co.uk/" >BRE  
</A>, UK) illustrated how trickle ventilators are able to supply
adequate background ventilation for occupied offices. Alois Sch&auml;lin
(<A HREF="http://www.ethz.ch/" >Federal Institute of Technology  
</A>, Switzerland) reported on both the method of predicting air
flows through open aircraft hanger doors using transient thermal
models and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and the possibility
of using huge air curtains to reduce heat loss in <A HREF="http://www.demon.co.uk/bcs/annex26.html" >such structures  
</A>. From Sweden, Sture Holmberg (<A HREF="http://www.nioh.se/nioh.html" >National Institute of Occupational Health  
</A>) showed encouraging results from field measurements, carried
out in the plastics industry, of the principles of practical displacement
ventilation. Two strategies for cooling (without dehumidification)
in non-residential buildings were explained by Andrew Martin (BSRIA,
UK) and Willigert Raatschen (Dornier GmbH, Germany). The UK strategy
concerned the use of automatic controls for natural ventilation
and passive cooling, whereas the German author presented the testing
of a thermosyphoning facade system.

<P>
Lars-G&ouml;ran M&aring;nsson (LGM Consult AB, Sweden) discussed
the various criteria influencing <A HREF="http://www.demon.co.uk/bcs/annex27.html" >domestic ventilation system performance  
</A>. As part of the <A HREF="http://www.demon.co.uk/bcs/annex27.html" >same study  
</A>, Johnny Kronvall (J &amp; W Consulting Engineers AB, Sweden)
described the simulation of passive stack ventilation (PSV) in
a single family house and suggested possible improvements. From
the Swedish National Testing &amp; Research Institute, Thomas
Carlsson outlined the results of calculations for mechanical exhaust
and balanced mechanical systems, concluding that outdoor air should
be supplied only via the bedrooms for both these systems. Also,
&Aring;ke Blomsterberg, from the same organisation, contrasted
the outcome of long-term monitoring of a representative sample
of dwellings in Sweden for different ventilation systems and also
showed the results of an occupant survey of indoor climate and
user interaction in post-1988 single family Swedish dwellings.
Findings reported by Duncan Hill (<A HREF="http://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/cmhc.html" >CMHC  
</A>) of an occupant survey in Canada concluded that increased
consumer education and refinement of controls and maintenance
strategies would be needed to ensure more success with mechanical
ventilation with heat recovery (MVHR).
<P>
Ulf Kr&uuml;ger (<A HREF="http://www.chalmers.se/Home-E.html" >Chalmers University  
</A>, Sweden) proposed that slot inlet devices are very difficult
to position without causing thermal discomfort. He justified this
with studies of temperature and air velocity distributions around
these devices in relation to occupation zones in residential buildings.
Still in Scandinavia, J&oslash;rn Brunsell (Norwegian Building
Research Institute) reported field tests of dynamic insulation
in four houses. These revealed that it is essential for the air
flow to remain constant, irrespective of climate, occupants, or
infiltration.
<H3><A NAME="Retrofit">Retrofit</A></H3>

<P>
Retrofit activities are very important, because the existing building
stock is substantially larger in size than the new building stock.
The number of buildings in need of renovation is therefore significant.
Peter Op 't Veld (NOVEM bv, The Netherlands) described the E'novation
programme of renovation of dwellings, in which buildings with
high energy use, poor indoor air quality (IAQ) and often moisture
and mould growth, were made more energy efficient (by an average
of 39%) with, in addition, improved IAQ. An overview of a French
guide to assist in the choice and sizing of PSV systems for apartment
retrofits for ventilation and gas exhaust flues was given by Jean-Georges
Villenave of <A HREF="http://193.104.99.10/" >CSTB  </A>. From
<A HREF="http://www.vtt.fi/rte/bldtech.html" >VTT Building Technology  
</A>in Finland, Jorma Sateri argued that the installation of heat
recovery in existing Finnish multi-family buildings would be economically
feasible if their airtightness was 2 to 3 air changes per hour
at 50 Pa, or better.
<H3><A NAME="Mites">Mites</A>, Mould and Moisture</H3>

<P>
Jan Nielsen (Danish Building Research Institute, Denmark) measured
humidity levels in 16 humidity-controlled mechanically ventilated
apartments in conjunction with another 16 identical apartments
(as a control group) with constant ventilation. Interestingly,
the humidity-controlled apartments were found to use less energy
for heating than the control group, but still met humidity requirements.
Furthermore, Donald McIntyre (EA Technology, UK) presented survey
results (conducted during a winter period) of humidity and dust
mites in 20 houses with MVHR and 20 other houses, from which he
concluded that the majority of the MVHR houses had humidity levels
sufficiently low to reduce dust mite numbers. This contrasted
with a minority of the other houses. Sarah Palin, also from EA
Technology, made a comparison of the energy consumption and resultant
indoor humidity levels with each of PSV, MVHR, and mechanical
extract fans (MEF) in a single family test house. Nigel Oseland
(<A HREF="http://www.bre.co.uk/" >BRE  </A>, UK) found that the
results of a postal survey of occupants of UK dwellings with either
PSV or MEF showed, in general, that those with PSV in their homes
seemed to have least problems with condensation or mould.
<H3><A NAME="Radon">Radon</A></H3>

<P>
Paul Welsh (<A HREF="http://www.bre.co.uk/" >BRE  </A>, UK) and
<A HREF="http://www.shef.ac.uk/students/ar/arp94fw/wang.html" >Fan Wang 
</A>(University of Sheffield, UK) have been independently examining
techniques for reducing radon concentration in UK single family
dwellings. Their results presented at the Conference, indicated
that extract ventilation (depressurisation) of the underfloor
space produced the greatest reduction in radon levels in the living
area. Pirjo Korhonen (University of Kuopio, Finland) found that
radon levels in various workplaces in Finland depended mainly
on the type of foundation and the magnitude of depressurisation
of the work space. Richard Grot (Lagus Applied Technology, USA)
explained how, using SF6 as a tracer gas in tunnels in a uranium
mine, the transport of radon through the overlying soil and into
the cellars of 15 different buildings above had been investigated.
<H3><A NAME="Calculation">Calculation </A>Techniques</H3>

<P>
An important mechanism for implementing research results is the
production of calculation methods. Iain Walker (<A HREF="http://www.lbl.gov/" >LBNL  
</A>, USA) explained his simplified procedure for the calculation
of attic ventilation rates. Willem de Gids (<A HREF="http://www.tno.nl/instit/bouw/home.html" >TNO  
</A>, The Netherlands) stated that <A HREF="http://www.tno.nl/instit/bouw/home.html" >TNO  
</A>now has an algorithm for the calculation of building surface
wind pressure coefficients, which has been designed to take into
account surrounding shielding. An integrated approach to predicting
building air flows by combining network models, CFD, and thermal
simulation was reported by Jan Hensen (<A HREF="http://www.strath.ac.uk/Departments/ESRU/esru.html" >University of Strathclyde  
</A>, UK) together with the 'onions' and 'ping-pong' alternative
methods of coupling heat and air flow solvers. Both Muriel Regard
(<A HREF="http://www.entpe.fr/" >ENTPE  </A>, France) and Martin
Simons (<A HREF="http://www.gold.net/users/ea78/iobe.htm" >Coventry University  
</A>, UK) presented their work on using CFD for ventilation effectiveness
calculations. Prompted by <A HREF="http://www.ashrae.org/" >ASHRAE  
</A>Standard 62-1989, Milton Meckler (The Meckler Group, USA)
demonstrated dynamic IAQ models of ventilation system response
to emissions.
<H3><A NAME="Measurement">Measurement</A> Techniques</H3>

<P>
A crucial aspect of ventilation research is having good measurement
techniques. Stephen Flanders (<A HREF="http://www.usace.army.mil/inside/crrel-w3/crrel-text/" >US Army Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory  
</A>, USA) pointed out the uncertainties associated with fan pressurisation
measurement, in particular, if <A HREF="http://www.iso.ch/" >ISO  
</A>, CGSB and ASTM protocols are followed. Michael Cui (<A HREF="http://www.uiuc.edu/" >University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign  
</A>, USA) has been using particle-imaging velocimetry to produce
whole room air velocity profiles. Peter Wouters (BBRI, Belgium)
proposed that acceptable results can be achieved for the investigation
of airborne moisture transport if accurate humidity measurements
are made and tracer gas studies are used to find air flow rates.
<H3>Conference <A NAME="Awards">Awards</A> and Banquet</H3>

<P>
Miriam Byrne, Imperial College, UK received the Best Paper award
for her presentation entitled &quot;Particulate Deposition on
Indoor Surfaces - its Role, with Ventilation, in Indoor Air Quality
Prediction&quot;. The Best Poster was awarded to Richard Diamond
and Helmut Feustel of <A HREF="http://www.lbl.gov/" >LBNL  </A>,
USA for their poster entitled &quot;Air Flow Distribution in a
Mechanically Ventilated High-Rise Residential Building&quot;.
Both these awards were presented by the Guest Speaker, John Millhone,
Senior Fellow, Advanced International Studies, Battelle Pacific
Northwest Laboratories (on assignment from the <A HREF="http://www.doe.gov/" >US Department of Energy  
</A>). After the awards, John Millhone delivered an address entitled
&quot;AIVC - Looking to the Next 16 Years&quot; in which he stressed
the importance of the AIVC grasping the new opportunities created
by the growing international recognition of the importance of
energy efficiency. He said that changes are occurring in Central
and Eastern Europe, as countries in this area emerge from a centrally
controlled to a free-market economy which exposes their profligate
energy use and artificially low prices. He also saw AIVC playing
an expanded role in the growing concern over the damage to the
earth's climate being caused by greenhouse gases. He elaborated
by saying that as the dominant greenhouse gas emission is carbon
dioxide which is produced primarily by the burning of fossil fuels
for energy, then it follows that energy efficiency programs are
the fastest, cheapest and largest option available for containing
this problem. He went on to say that the AIVC must expand their
mission to provide information and services, designed for the
air infiltration and ventilation problems of the emerging free-market
countries, if necessary at a discounted cost or even funded through
a third party. In this way, he sees it as a low-cost method of
buying a world-class technology transfer service and the unique
and significant findings of the researchers in these new participating
countries would enrich the body of knowledge of the AIVC and give
it an expanded relevance to major energy efficiency and environmental
problems of the next 16 years. Just before the close of the Conference,
the Summing-Up was given by Martin Liddament, Head of the AIVC,
who reviewed how this field has progressed over the last 16 years.

<H1>Heat Pumps for Ventilation Exhaust Air Heat Recovery</H1>
<HR>

<H2><A NAME="beginning"></A>An Annotated Bibliography from the
AIVC</H2>

<H3>by Mark Limb, Air Infiltration Ventilation Centre</H3>

<P>
The AIVC's series of annotated bibliographies aims to review and
technically assess current literature and provide a concise but
in depth overview of particular subjects. The latest addition
to this series summarises research into the use and application
of heat pumps in ventilation heat recovery systems. It is aimed
at design professionals, researchers and engineers who have an
interest in heat pumps in ventilation systems.
<P>
The document is divided into six main sections.
<P>

<P>
Heat pumps are defined in the introduction by ASHRAE as devices
that extract heat from one substance and transfer it to another
portion of the same substance or to a second substance at a higher
temperature. In the case of heat pump heat recovery from ventilation
air, heat is extracted from a source, usually waste heat in the
extract air, and transferred to a suitable source, usually the
domestic hot water system or alternatively space heating system
of the ventilation supply air. In section two of this document,
the distinction is made between the two main types of heat pumps,
i.e., vapour compression and absorption heat pumps, and a brief
explanation of their relevant operational cycle is given. Section
two also defines the Coefficient of Performance and contains a
brief note on the use of relevant working fluids and the Montreal
Protocol.
<P>
The main body of this bibliography outlines those papers that
describe the use and installation of heat pumps in real buildings.
Section three concentrates on residential examples and section
four focuses on other buildings such as swimming pools and commercial
establishments. The most common configuration in all buildings
is an air-to-water type system, with the heat pump located in
the exhaust duct transferring waste heat to the hot water circuit.
Air-to-air heat pumps are also popular, where heat is transferred
to the supply air as a form of preheat. Novel configurations such
as &quot;Dynamic Insulation&quot; incorporating heat pumps have
also been included in this bibliography as well as the use of
heat pumps in swimming pools, schools, shops and offices.
<P>
In conclusion the studies outlined demonstrate that for typical
residential air-water heat pumps COP's of between 2 and 3.5 are
possible, and in extremely favourable cases they can be as high
as 5. While for residential air-to-air heat pumps COP's of between
2 to 5 were reported. Where combined heat pumps and heat exchangers
are utilised COP's can reach slightly over 5. For commercial buildings,
typical COP's range from 2 to 3, while for swimming pools examples
have quoted around 1.7. These examples demonstrate the potential
for heat pump technology to further enhance the energy efficiency
of our buildings.

Air quality, air flows in buildings, and ventilation are most important topics. Good air quality is however critically dependent also on other things than ventilation, eg source strengths, as is well known. The theme of our conference could also lead to the assumption that there is a simple connection between ventilation and air quality. As the public tend to see ventilation systems as responsible for bad air quality, it is important to state that there is no general criterion for good air quality possible to use in practice to control ventilation processes. Automatic ventilation control is still possible in specific cases only. The ventilation process depends on the total air exchange in the building, which is difficult to control. A related question is: what is acceptable as ventilation air? Is air leaking in through the outer wall acceptable? Is air supplied through the staircases acceptable? To answer such questions air quality criteria are needed too.

Adequate ventilation with the "right amount of air, to the right place and at the right time" are important factors for achieving a good indoor climate. Thus it is of prime importance that the ventilation system is working properly. Using traditional methods, it is a very time consuming, and some times even impossible, task to balance ventilation systems to achieve correct air distribution. In most countries the growing concern about Indoor Air Quality has resulted in Building Codes demanding increased ventilation rates. This makes it even more critical that ventilation systems are correctly balanced. Otherwise the effort of solving one problem: "inadequate ventilation", may create two new problems: "draught and noise". This paper describes the "DPM method which is a new method for balancing ventilation systems. The balancing "starts at the designer's desk" by doing a comprehensive computerised pressure loss analysis. The results from this analysis are then input to a PC connected with an electronic instrument. The PC/instrument may be used for balancing when the air terminals are already installed in the building. However, there is a much larger potential for time and cost savings when using the DPM method for pre-setting air terminals at the factory. For this purpose a "DPM machine" has been designed for computerised pre-setting and bar code labelling of air terminals. With impressive results the ventilation systems in a number of buildings have been balanced in the last two years using the described innovative technology.

The effect of recirculation on the age of air is described. A new effectiveness measure called the relative air-change effectiveness is defined in such a way that the air distribution pattern in a room may be quantitatively characterized even when the age of the supply air is non-zero. This admits the evaluation of air distribution patterns in single-zone systems that recirculate air, and also multizone systems with or without recirculation. It is shown that the relative air-change effectiveness may be calculated either solely from age of air measurements of from age of air measurements and flow rate measurements. Re-evaluation of previously published experimental data demonstrates how knowledge of the relative air-change effectiveness may change conclusions drawn from experiments in working buildings.

A condition often assumed when designing a naturally ventilated building is where air enters at low level and leaves at high level due to the stack effect. It then follows that, at upper levels, the air may be relatively 'stale' since it has previously passed through the lower storeys. An analogous situation may arise when wind is blowing, in which the air entering through the windward face becomes stale as it passes through the building to the downwind sections. It is not well understood how ventilation may, in reality, be affected by this. To address these issues, this report describes a modelling approach using BREEZE and complimentary measurements using the Passive Tracer Gas technique to study local ventilation rates in multiroomed office buildings. Calculations show that simple ventilation flow rates, as conventionally calculated at the design stage, cannot be relied upon to indicate the true 'freshness'. Measurements show that effective ventilation can be less than current minimum occupancy requirements.

This paper reports the findings of a pilot field study carried out to investigate the internal and external air pollution levels of two adjacent buildings, one naturally-ventilated and the other air-conditioned in an urban area, to investigate their relative attenuation of external pollution levels and to compare internal levels with existing air quality guidelines. Concentration levels of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide were monitored, Simultaneously, measurements of ventilation rates within the buildings and periodic video recordings of the traffic were also carried out. As expected the concentration of external pollutants in the buildings followed the daily external variation, but at reduced levels. Generally, pollutant levels were higher in the naturally ventilated building than in the air-conditioned building. However, on a number of occasions, combustion products from heating boilers were entrained into the air-conditioned building via the high level air intake of the ventilation system raising the levels of nitrogen oxides, sulphur dioxide and carbon dioxide inside the building to higher than those found externally. A comparison of the results with existing air quality guidelines or standards for exposure showed that in both buildings the level of contamination was less than the relevant standard, except during a limited period at the weekend when combustion products were possibly entrained into the air-conditioned building. There is thus no clear distinction between the two types of ventilation strategies in terms of providing adequate indoor air quality to the occupants of the buildings.

The aim of this study was to compare the radon levels at workplaces and in homes located nearby. Homes (number of 57) and partly or fully underground workrooms (number of 55) have been studied at the four workplaces in southern Finland and one workplace in northern Finland. Radon concentrations both at workplaces and in homes seemed to be at the same level in the same district. The mean radon concentration in workrooms was 406 Bq.m-3, and in homes concentration was 398 Bq.m-3. At the workplaces having mere exhaust ventilation the mean radon concentration was higher (arithmetic mean of 677 Bq.m-3 n=14), than the places having mechanical exhaust and supply ventilation (arithmetic mean of 207 Bq.m-3, n=33). In an average the naturally ventilated workplaces (n=8) had the lowest level of indoor radon (arithmetic mean of 133 Bq.m-3). The highest radon level, both in the workrooms (2937 Bq.m-3) and in the homes (3080 Bq.m-3), was found in the northern Finland. The high values of indoor radon might be partly explained by the hill-construction of buildings without sealed constructions against soil, and partly by depressurisation caused by mechanical exhaust ventilation.

In the urban environment, there is strong evidence that fine particulates associated with vehicular emissions are linked with respiratory problems and an increase in mortality. The population sector most at risk is the elderly who spend much of their time indoors; consequently, the infiltration of these particles and their subsequent behaviour indoors is of primary concern. The deposition of aerosol particles in the respiratory system and on indoor surfaces is a process governed by particle size; in addition to providing risk assessment data, an understanding of the interaction of particles with indoor surfaces can be applied to the design of systems for enhancing indoor aerosol deposition and thus inhibiting inhalation exposure. This paper describes experiments using tracer-labelled aerosols, in a range of monodisperse size distributions representative of real particulate pollutants, to study aerosol deposition on surfaces with representative roughness. Some preliminary data, exhibiting electrostactically-enhanced aerosol deposition are also presented. In order to make these data widely accessible, the experimental results are used to aid in the development of a CFD code by providing validation data. Simulations are described for a room-sized enclosure with representative indoor surfaces, to illustrate the influence of internal building surface characteristics on indoor aerosol concentration modification.

The present paper presents results from measurements of outdoor airflow rates and air change rates carried out simultaneously with measurements of the indoor concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2). The measurements were made both under controlled laboratory conditions and in the field. The field experiments were performed in a conference room, an assembly hall and an office room, and laboratory investigation was carried out in a 19 m3 test chamber. CO2 measurements can be successfully used to estimate the outdoor airflow rate in occupied rooms, but it is vital that the methodology takes into consideration a number of possible sources of errors. For example, it can not be presupposed that steady-state conditions prevail. However, inaccuracies due to non steady-state conditions may be reduced by a thorough analysis of the measurement results. Furthermore, it is demonstrated how the air change rate can be determined using a method based on analysis of the CO2-concentration decay in a room.

This study is done by order of a Finnish air cooler manufacturer and it is founded to a master's thesis of the same subject matter. The company produces eg unit air coolers with electric fans and so the aim of the study was to reduce draught problems caused by cold air jets. The desired values were: Because there are two different ways to reach and maintain low temperatures in cold working rooms we first compare the advantages and disadvantages of both methods and then get acquainted with cold air jets and reducing draught problems they can cause. The cooling coil can be mounted in the ventilating unit in which case the cold air has to be blown into rooms through ducts and conventional air outlets. Cooling coils can also be mounted directly to the ceiling in cold rooms. In that case there is often used forced convection which is carried out with electric fans. The forced convection improves heat transfer and so it is possible to make coils of compact size. The installation with cooler coils and electric fans is called unit air cooler. The former method makes it possible to have silent cold rooms with good and even distribution. The air distribution can be still improved by using porous textile ducts and let the cold air flow through the cloth into the room. However, there can be some hygienic problems. Hygienic problems can be minimised with the latter method, unit air coolers, because they are quite easy to maintain and keep clean. The disadvantage is that there can be some noise and draught problems. Noise problems can be solved by using fans with low RPM, but the draught problem still remains. It can be reduced with air deflectors which intensify the so-called Coanda effect. The results of this study are utilised in a novel series of air coolers.

AIOLOS is a project partly financed by the European Commission, DG XVII for Energy, within the frame of the ALTENER programme. The purpose of the project is the creation and dissemination of educational material on the use of passive ventilation cooling systems and techniques as applied in buildings. All information will be coupled with the problems of passive solar heating, daylighting and visual comfort. The project is oriented to South European but also North European countries with moderate climate presenting cooling problems. Existing information and knowledge together with recent European research results will be compiled into an educational package. The package will include brochures of case studies, slides, didactic software, technical manuals, guidelines and a handbook with basic and up-to-date knowledge acquired by recent research projects in the field. The aim of the project is to provide building professionals with all necessary knowledge and tools on the efficient use of passive ventilation in buildings. All material will be in a flexible form so that it can be updated on a regular basis. Dissemination will be achieved by seminars attended by building professionals. The overall duration of the project is 18 months.

In response to complaints about poor air quality in bus termini, the Hong Kong Government is considering imposing legislative control over ventilation system design and operation of bus termini in Hong Kong. However, there are, as yet, no relevant air quality criteria and ventilation system design guidelines for Hong Kong. In this paper, measured air quality data for 5 semi-enclosed bus termini are reviewed. This provides a picture of the prevalent air quality in bus termini. To establish a design guide for ventilation systems for Hong Kong, a number of overseas design guides are examined and a ventilation system design method is proposed. The significance of design parameters, such as bus engine emission rates, utilization of the terminus, ventilation effectiveness, etc, are discussed.

This paper presents the special needs and difficulties concerning cooling and ventilation of the SwissMetro high-speed ground transportation system. SwissMetro is based on four complementary technologies: a complete underground infrastructure, a partly evacuated tunnel system to reduce the aerodynamic drag of the vehicle with a maximum speed between 400 and 500km/h, linear electric motors and a magnetic levitation and guiding system. Due to high internal and external heat loads permanent cooling and air-conditioning of the vehicle is required. Additional thermal problems may occur in the case of an emergency. The pressure level inside the tunnel has to be raised within a short period of time to guarantee the safety of the passengers and to avoid any health risks. This repressurisation of long tunnel sections may cause shock waves and high temperatures inside the tunnel. The aim of the project is to analyse the spatial and temporal temperature evolution in the SwissMetro tunnels under different conditions and in emergency situations.

A naturally ventilated three level office building has been used to study basic stack ventilation configurations and the interaction between ventilation and the subsequent cooling of the building structure in summer. The research was performed in the framework of a European project on passive cooling of buildings and the objective was to validate simple ventilation algorithms and to give an experimental basis to design guidelines for night cooling techniques. The multilevel office allowed the studying of the influence of openings (size and position) on the neutral pressure level (NPL) and on airflow rates. Various cross-ventilation situations have been studied. A single flow path configuration was obtained by closing all windows and doors in the building envelope with the exception of the roof exhaust and one office window as the ventilation air inlet. Air flow patterns were traced with smoke and tracer gas. In a first set of experiments, where the only driving force is stack pressure, air velocities and the position of the NPL have been measured, and contraction and velocity coefficients as used in the Bernoulli model have been observed. In a second set of experiments, the resulting effective area of a combination of two openings in series was studied. Air flow rates derived from velocity measurements in the open doorways were found to be in agreement with the flow rates obtained with a constant injection tracer gas technique, with an uncertainty of +/-20%. Overall agreement was found between the velocity measurements and simplified models based on the Bernoulli equation. In order to cool multiple levels of a building with outside air, the position of the neutral pressure level should be controlled. The restrictions on opening size and position are discussed.

Low emitting building materials have contributed to the reduction of indoor air contaminants, and in many countries gas ranges and gas cookers are rarely used. As a result, in buildings located in urban environments, a considerable part of the contaminants in the indoor air may originate from the outdoor air. In urban areas buildings are exposed to high concentrations of a large number of contaminants, especially during traffic peak hours. Often, the air intakes are located on the facades, and if there are no filters, the supply air will have the same content of contaminants as the outdoor air adjacent to the buildings. Where if possible, it is advantageous to place the air intakes on the roofs of the buildings (1). The higher the air intakes are placed, the better is the air quality in most cases. To avoid exposure to high concentrations indoors due to concentration peaks of contaminants in the outdoor air, it is possible to decrease the airflow rate temporarily (2). This could be done by monitoring the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO) adjacent to the air intake. When the outdoor concentration of CO exceeds a preset limit, the fans are simply switched off, or the speed of the fans are decreased to a more suitable level.

The paper will discuss problems connected with incorporation of stochastic factors into deterministic models of indoor air quality. Three different methods: * quasi dynamic multi-zone modelling with generating of input data time series, * multi-zone modelling based on the theory of stochastic differential equations, * Monte-Carlo simulation with independent random generating of stochastic parameters, will be shortly presented. Described methods are compared on the base of computer simulation of CO2 concentration in simple two compartment office. The comparison of simulation outcomes shows that the way of stochastic disturbances incorporation into indoor air quality models does not have an important influence on mean value of predicted concentration. At the same time the analysis of standard deviations indicates that the method of disturbances generation and its later incorporation have a great influence on probability distribution of estimated concentrations. The author would like to highlight that differences. The conclusions include also subjective opinion of the author on main advantages and disadvantages of each of proposed methods.

The performance of mechanical ventilation systems has been checked in several innovative residential houses in the frame of Swiss research as well as pilot and demonstration projects. This paper gives a list of performance criteria for the ongoing comparison and evaluation of these mechanical ventilation systems. For some criteria, target values are proposed. In the second part, this paper shortly describes four residential buildings with mechanical ventilation systems where such evaluations were performed and highlights interesting design features and results from the measurements. It then focuses on discrepancies between the design goals and what has been encountered in reality during the evaluation campaign. Problem items were, among others, commissioning, occupant acceptance and window opening behaviour as well as sealing of ducts and heat exchangers.

The comparison of the performance of ventilation systems must take into account different issues. For indoor air quality, different kinds of pollutant sources have to be defined. To make an evaluation of the results, the best approach is to consider the people exposure. Four generic pollutants are taken into account: rooms components or furniture, human metabolism, cooking activities, passive smoking. As the definition of the unit for each pollutant is free, it is useful for their comparison to press them on a common "normalised" basis. This enables to make a distinction between the simulations based on generic pollutants and their interpretation which could be derived for many kinds of pollutants without having to do additional calculations as far as the considered pollutant follows the conventional patterns. The pressure difference, for example can be related to radon issues as to running of some heat appliances. The room parameters are mainly related to humidity issues as condensation, mould growth or house dust mites. For energy issues, a distinction has to be made between the direct energy use (fans) and the heat needs due to ventilation. Such a methodology has been defined within the IEA annex 27 project. After a presentation of the different parameters taken into account, we describe the computer code SIREN95 developed at CSTB in order to obtain the required results and we present a sensitivity analysis for the basic ventilation system used in France (mechanical exhaust).

The study concerns the ventilation of a parallelepiped shaped room by means of several systems whose supplying and extracting methods differ, so the different thermic conditions applied to limits. To qualify the efficiency of each of these systems in relation with the various current criteria, we carried out measurements by means of a tracer gas, both with a transitory and a permanent flow. At the same time, numerical simulations were carried out by means of a CFD code which solves the equations of the fluids mechanic, material and heat transfers associated with flows. These calculations results, after measurements validation, enable to accurately know the air movements in the ventilated room as well as the tracer gas concentrations distribution in the tested configurations. From these calculation results, was also demonstrated how the complex behaviour of each of these ventilation systems can be characterised owing to the possibility of identifying it to a simple model, using a reduced number of parameters. These typical parameters can in turn be used to implement the system performance evaluation criteria. These criteria allow to compare the various studied ventilation systems and class them in performance order. It can be seen that this classification can be modified depending on the selected criterion as well as the chosen ventilated area. The study results equally show the interest of the use of numerical simulation together with experiments, thus extending the range of results in order to generalise conclusions.

The LTEE laboratory of Hydro-Quebec, in collaboration with Canada Mortgage and Housing conducted an indoor air quality study involving 30 single family detached houses heated with electric baseboard heaters in the vicinity of Trois Rivieres during the 1993-94 heating season. The houses were selected according to the measured air leakage at 50 Pa. so as to have a sample distribution similar to the distribution of air leakage of houses in the province of Quebec. The "source strength" of several air pollutants were calculated from measurements of ambient pollutant levels and total ventilation during a one-week test. In addition, the indoor CO2 and humidity levels were recorded in eight of the houses continuously during the heating season. The level of CO2 in the master bedroom was found to follow fairly closely the CO2 level in other parts of the building including the basement (within about 200 ppm) except when the bedroom door was closed. With the room occupied and the door closed, CO2 levels in the bedroom increased steadily during the night until morning, when the door was opened, to levels in excess of 3 500 ppm with one person, and in excess of 4 500 ppm with two persons. Model studies using the measured pollutant source strengths and measured equivalent leakage areas of the buildings indicated that the recommended health guidelines for airborne respirable solid particles (RSP's), CO2 and formaldehyde are exceeded during periods of low total ventilation, coinciding with mild outdoor temperatures and low wind conditions. It was observed that kitchen and bathroom fans originally installed in some of these houses were not operated by the occupants for sufficiently long times to affect the quality of indoor air. Various different methods of ventilating some of the houses were tested, including quiet replacement exhaust fans, mixing fans for indoor air, and a fresh air intake and mixing system. The effects of operating various air handling systems were monitored by keeping track of indoor CO2 and relative humidity in the master bedroom, and occupancy in person-hours per day. Quiet replacement fans noticeably improved indoor air quality when these were operated over 50% to 100% of the time. An area of remaining concern is the fact that exhaust only systems accentuate the negative pressure in the basement by raising the level of the neutral pressure zone in the building, and may enhance the flow of soil gases into the basement. A system which mixed indoor air between the basement and the main floor also reduced the average level of indoor pollutants. The system was designed to create a pressure difference between the main floor and the basement, causing a slight pressurization of the basement. A system designed to introduce 5L/s of outdoor air and to mix it with 55L/s of indoor air for tempering was installed to draw air from the hallway and deliver the mixed air into each of three bedrooms. This system was capable of maintaining CO2 levels in the master bedroom below 1000 ppm with two occupants in the room and the door closed.

The role of ventilation in the housing stock is to provide fresh air and to dilute internally-generated pollutants in order to assure adequate indoor air quality. Energy is required to provide this ventilation service, either directly for moving the air or indirectly for conditioning the outdoor air for thermal comfort. Different kinds of ventilation systems have different energy requirements. Existing dwellings in the United States are ventilated primarily through leaks in the building shell (ie infiltration) rather than by mechanical ventilation systems. This report ascertains, from best available data, the energy liability associated with providing the current levels of ventilation and to estimate the energy savings or penalties associated with tightening or loosening the building envelope while still providing ventilation for adequate indoor air quality. Various ASHRAE Standards (eg 62 119 and 136) are used to determine acceptable ventilation levels and energy requirements. Building characteristics, energy use, and building tightness data are combined to estimate both the energy liabilities of ventilation and its dependence on building stock characteristics. The average annual ventilation energy use for a typical dwelling is about 61 GJ (roughly 50% of total space conditioning energy usage); the cost-effective savings potential is about 38 GJ. The national cost savings potential, by tightening the houses to the ASHRAE Standard 119 levels while sill providing adequate ventilation through infiltration or mechanical ventilation, is $2.4 billion. The associated total annual ventilation energy use for the residential stock is about 4.5EJ (ExaJoules).

The research community as well as the design and construction practice is spending a lot of efforts and investments in developing systems which optimise the energy use for achieving certain specified air flow rates. For example, improvements in efficiencies of 10 % in heat recovery systems would be considered as remarkable. At present, one observes a tremendous difference in the ventilation requirements in various countries as well as at the European level. Variation of a factor 10 of the ventilation rate requirement can be found in the proposal for European standard CEN prENV 1752 depending on the 'cleanness'of the building. The present paper develops these problems and makes a comparison with the situation in other areas like thermal comfort and lighting requirements.

The acceptance and appreciation of ventilation systems is mainly determined by the perceived indoor air quality, thermal comfort and noise. Noise in relation to ventilation systems can be divided into three categories: * outdoor noise (entering the dwelling through ventilation openings, cracks, mechanical supply and exhaust openings etc); * noise generated by components of the ventilation system; * the impact of ventilation systems on sound reduction of partitions (between dwellings, rooms etc). Depending on the type of ventilation system, one or more of these aspects are of concern. Noise related to the ventilation system and components, can result in turning off the ventilation system or closing vents etc. This can have a negative influence on ventilation and indoor air quality. In the framework of IEA ANNEX 27 several noise aspects of domestic ventilation systems have been evaluated. Outdoor noise: In noise loaded areas the selection and the applicability of different types of ventilation systems are determined by the noise level on the facades. A simplified tool is developed to select ventilation systems as a function of the required noise reduction of the facade, room dimensions and design and construction of the facade. System noise: Controlling noise levels caused by ventilation systems is in practice one of the most important factors to contribute to the satisfaction with a ventilation system. Air duct systems in dwellings transport noise generated by fans and aerodynamic noise generated by bends, control valves, grilles etc. ANNEX 27 gives basic formulas to estimate sound power levels of fans and grilles, indication of sizes for silencers and guidelines for design. Impact on noise reduction of partitions: The composite sound reduction is the result of different sound channels from one room to the other. One of these sound channels may be the ventilation system (cross-talk). Cross-talk can be brought about through the air duct system, overflow grilles and ventilation openings in partitions, duct transitions etc. ANNEX 27 provides guidelines for sound reductions of partitions and insertion losses for ducts to eliminate the influence of cross-talk.

To ensure indoor air quality an efficient ventilation system should provide fresh air in those parts of a room where it is required. To assess whether the ventilation system fulfils the main objective, different definitions of local ventilation efficiency (the local mean age of air, the local ventilation rate, the local purging flow rate and the local air exchange rate) are reported in literature. Tracer gas techniques (step up method, step down method and pulse method) and CFD-models are mostly used in research to identify the 3-D distribution of these ventilation parameters in a ventilated space. In our laboratory the 'local volumetric concentration of fresh air flow rate' (m3/s.m3) was introduced as a new ventilation parameter. A total amount of 90 step up experiments was performed in a laboratory test installation with a volume of 9 m3 (3x2x1.5m) to model the 3-D distribution of this ventilation parameter in relation to different values of the ventilation rate (120-300 m3/h) and the heat supply (0-400 Watt) as control inputs. In the main part of the paper some results are given of the modelled 3-D distribution of the 'volumetric concentration of fresh air flow rate' in the test installation. This distribution of fresh air flow rate is assessed in relation to the air flow pattern which is visualised by smoke experiments and quantified by image analysis and the Archimedes number.

Ventilation is necessary to provide a good indoor air quality to occupants in office buildings but is however a major energy consumer. In that manner, ventilation in itself can contribute to much more than 50% of the energy consumption for heating in well insulated office buildings. Likewise, the general trend in standards to augment ventilation requirements would still increase its energy costs. Thus, it seems obvious that an intelligent control of ventilation in office building allows to obtain substantial reductions of energy consumption. To a certain extent this is also true for dwellings even if in general ventilation represents a smaller contribution to the energy consumption for heating than in office buildings. In this connection, it should be noted that the increasing requirements regarding insulation of dwellings has for effect to augment this proportion. Demand controlled ventilation in dwellings appears therefore also as an interesting way to achieve energy consumption reduction.

Many modern buildings in the Nordic countries have mechanical ventilation. Passive stack ventilation is, however, an accepted ventilation system in the Nordic countries according to the current building codes. The building authorities need to be able to supply guidelines on natural ventilation systems in modern buildings, in order to fulfill the requirements on a healthy indoor climate at a reasonable energy cost. Therefore a project was initiated by the Nordic committee on building regulations. The aim of the project was to present functional and technical requirements on natural ventilation systems. The paper discusses the influence of outdoor air vents and airtightness on passive stack ventilation for Nordic dwellings. Calculations, based on measurements, were performed for a one storey one-family house, a 11/2-storey one-family house and two apartments in a three-storey building. Cumulative distributions of ventilation rates for a year were calculated, using a multi-zone air flow model, for individual rooms. It is shown that the ventilation rate will vary very much, without any interaction from the occupants or an automatic control system. A modern system for passive stack ventilation must include a system for control of the air flows in order to avoid excessive use of energy and inadequate indoor air quality.

The problem of sensation of draught in ventilated spaces is connected to inappropriate velocities in the occupied zone. In Scandinavia, velocities higher than 0.15 m/s are said to be an indicator of that occupants are likely to feel discomfort. Therefore knowledge of the flow field (both mean velocities and fluctuations) is necessary. Both experimental and numerical analysis of the flow field in a full scale room ventilated by a slot inlet, with two inlet Reynolds numbers 2440 and 7110, have been carried out. Results from both approaches show that the location of the maximum velocity near the floor is nearly independent of the Reynolds number. For a two-dimensional room, the maximum velocity at the floor level occurred at about 2/3 room length from the supply. The distance from the floor level is dependent on the inlet Reynolds number. The velocity profiles far away from the wall opposite to the inlet device have the same character as a wall jet profile. However, close to the corners they are transformed. The relative turbulence intensities measured in the return flow region are questionable, because of a hot wire's inability to record large fluctuations at low mean velocities. These turbulence intensities close to floor level vary from 15 to 80% and as the authors have pointed out previously hot wires do not indicate the real value of the turbulence intensities beyond 20%. Difficulties appear in numerical predictions of return flow properties. Comparison between predicted values and experimentally obtained values show a reasonable agreement. This is promising for future CFD-predictions. However, there is a need for an appropriate measurement technique that can cope with reversing flow.

Full scale measurements of air flow velocities, temperature, intensity of turbulence and air exchange rate are carried out on two rooms with different types of ventilation located in the department of architecture at Chalmers University of Technology. The measurements have shown that mixed ventilation gives variable mean flow velocities with a high risk of draught as compared to the room provided with displacement ventilation. Air exchange rate for the room with displacement ventilation is obtained from tracer gas monitor by employing decay and constant emission methods. The measurements give similar results for both the methods.

The homogeneous emission passive tracer gas technique is described. This technique relies on an even distribution of constant tracer gas emission rate within the object to be measured, so that the emission rate per volume unit is constant. The local steady state concentration of the tracer gas is directly proportional to the mean age of air and the emission rate per volume unit. The technique was applied in 10 school buildings, of which 4 were newly constructed naturally ventilated buildings, 2 were old naturally ventilated buildings, 2 were old mechanically ventilated buildings and 2 were newly constructed supply and exhaust ventilated buildings. The result shows that the ventilation rates in naturally ventilated schools are relatively low compared to required standards. It demonstrates the importance of not only relying on the naturally induced ventilation rate, but also to use other means for improving the air quality during or between lessons, like window opening.

The use of local exhaust is considered to be the most effective way to control pollutant dispersion from intense sources, such as in kitchens, in toilets, as well as in copy machine rooms. The optimum air exhaust rate required to prevent pollutants from escaping into the major occupant areas very much depends on the natural air exchange rate (AER) between the hooded room and the major room space. This paper presents a mathematical model and a test procedure of using tracer gas technique to quantify the AER. In this study, the mathematical model analyzes the balance the balance of a tracer gas in two adjacent zones, and establishes two correlations between the dimensionless increase/decay rates of the gas concentrations and the AER. The mathematical model reveals two alternative ways to determine the AER: a). Tracer gas concentrations in both rooms involved be monitored; b). Tracer gas concentration in one of the two spaces be monitored. The latter method was validated in a test for AER quantification between ceiling void and room in a test chamber. Finally the proper use of the two methods is discussed, and it is suggested that the techniques developed in this study can be used for estimating minimum exhaust rate requirement for ventilation system renovation in existing buildings.

The work presented in this paper is aimed at the definition of tracer gas experimental procedures for measuring the air change rate, the age of air and the air change efficiency in real buildings under mechanical ventilation conditions. The measurement procedures, based on the decay method, were validated in a special experimental chamber and implemented in two rooms of a building under real operating conditions. Measurements of volumetric flow rate through the air ducts of two buildings, performed by means of the constant emission rate method, will be shown and commented. Results of some measurements obtained by tracer gas technique have been compared with values measured by using other traditional methods.

The first part of the paper will show some aspects of experimental research on air distribution in ventilated rooms. The study has been carried out to get an understanding of the air movement and the ventilation effectiveness by means of tracer gas measurements. It has been investigated the velocity and the distribution of the concentration in a two-dimensional isothermal flow issue of a linear supply opening. The second part of the paper will describe a proposed zonal model in 9 zones. This model is able to predict the steady-state behaviour of ventilated rooms and the dynamic evolution of a possible pollutant concentration in such environment. The theoretical model is based on the flow element method according to the throw of an isothermal jet and on a typical configuration of a zonal model. Comparison between experimental measurements and the zonal model show a good agreement on the range of usual air change rate in the ventilated rooms.

The common way to determine air infiltration, exfiltration and interzonal flows from tracer gas measurements in multizoned buildings is to rely upon the standard single or multizone model, Vc(t) = Qc(t)+p(t). Here c, p are zonal tracer concentrations and injections, t is time and V, Q are the sought volumes and flows. This model may work well provided that all zones are sufficiently well mixed and all flows really are constant during the measurements. The latter can be doubtful in naturally ventilated buildings, especially as the measurements may require several hours. This paper discusses one single question: What could be gained if the flows of the model are allowed to vary in time?, ie we will consider a (bilinear) model:Vc(t) = Q(t)+p(t). The variation of Q(t) will, however, be restricted to be piecewise linear. This extension will complicate the identification procedure, ie the computations, somewhat. On the other hand it does not alter the tracer gas measurements needed. The idea is rather to pick out more information from the standard tracer gas measurements. To test the extended model, single-tracer gas measurements have been carried out in a natural ventilated row house. Some basic concepts are introduced with one and two zone models and the house is modelled with a nine zones model. As intended, the extended model matches the measurements better. However, as demonstrated in the paper, this does not guarantee that the model found actually is better.

This paper reports on the use of BRE's domestic ventilation model, BREVENT, to predict subfloor and whole house ventilation rates in a BRE/DoE test house. Before the model could be used though some minor adjustments were necessary because one of its underlying assumptions was that the subfloor temperature was equal to the external temperature. Temperature measurements over a number of months showed this assumption to be false and so an extra stack term was introduced into the model. However, the overall difference this makes is still quite small, only a few percent at most. The predicted subfloor ventilation rate matched the calculated value well, particularly when it was stack dominated. When wind played a significant part though the level of agreement deteriorated, particularly when subfloor air bricks were located on unsheltered walls. However, both the subfloor and whole house ventilation rate of the test house appears to be heavily influenced by the stack effect because the suspended floor and ceiling are leaky in comparison to the walls. As a result, subfloor ventilation will be stack dominated about 61% of the time. To improve the prediction of wind affected subfloor ventilation better pressure coefficient data is required. In a similar vein BREVENT can predict whole house ventilation rates best when the flow is stack dominated. Analysis of the separate stack and wind effects show that the ventilation in the test house will be stack dominated for about 86% of the time. When wind speed does influence ventilation then wind direction also has an effect: winds blowing from the East and West generally give ventilation rates 25% lower than those blowing from the North and South.

Existing experimental techniques for calculating air flow through building cracks are usually based upon relationships derived from experimental studies employing relatively simple procedures. Typically, a fixed pressure difference, DELTA P, is established across the crack of interest and then the air flow Q through the crack is determined. Most crack flow equations take the pressure differential DELTA P to be steady-state. In reality, the wind forces which generate much of the driving pressures represent highly fluctuating signals. A basic problem is to know what effect a fluctuating DELTA P has on the overall air flow through building cracks. The basic aim of this study was to determine the impact of these fluctuating pressures on crack flow equations. Experimental techniques generated sinusoidal pressure fluctuations across a range of fabricated, straight-through cracks, ranging from 1 to 5 mm thickness. Fluctuation frequencies from 0.5 to 2.0 Hz were used in the investigations. The results suggest that the average flow under conditions of fluctuating pressure differentials does not differ significantly from the flow which would occur if the mean pressure differential were imposed. This implies that the instantaneous flow at any fluctuating value of the pressure differential is that corresponding to the pressure differential on the steady-state flow-pressure curve.

Tracer gases are commonly used to evaluate the performance of ventilation systems. One way to reduce the time, complexity, and cost of such experiments is to use the carbon dioxide generated by occupants as a tracer gas. In this paper, a method for using the carbon dioxide generated by occupants as a tracer gas for determining the effective supply air flow rate to a zone or the relative air-change effectiveness of a zone is described. The approach is to make use of a model of the accumulation dynamics and a model of the way that occupants generate carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide accumulation dynamics are modeled as a first-order perfect-mixing process with bypass. The rate at which occupants generate carbon dioxide is modeled as an integrated random process. Sudden changes in the rate at which carbon dioxide is generated in a zone that occur when occupants enter and leave are detected using statistical techniques. The detector is used to adjust the gains of an estimator that determines either the effective supply air flow rate or the relative air-change effectiveness and also the rate at which occupants generate carbon dioxide. This can be done even when the rate at which occupants generate carbon dioxide changes with time and when the concentration of carbon dioxide in the supply air changes with time. The performance of the strategy is demonstrated with experimental results on a room in a working building.

In order to study the use of electricity in Swedish office buildings in detail, the Swedish Council for Building Research initiated four monitoring and building simulation projects in 1989. The project buildings represent different ages and different HVAC technologies. Based on a combination of hourly monitored data during four years, building simulations using the DOE2 program have been carried out. In two of the buildings, energy conservation measures have been implemented too. An interesting aspect in our study is the so called load factor. Load factors for lighting and other electric loads are evaluated. Taking this into account, you can optimize the design of the air flow rates and the cooling systems and reduce the investment and operational costs for the HVAC systems. Thanks to a correct HVAC design you may also reduce the negative impact on the environment by less use of CFCs etc. The studies indicate that the load factor variation in Swedish office buildings, during a day or a week, diverge substantially from the schedules for lighting and office machines etc according to the ASHRAE 90.1-1989 Standard. Regarding office machines etc, the installed power density also diverges to a great extent.

Ad Hoc Group 4 of Working Group 2 of CEN TC156 (Ventilation) was set up to put forward standardised techniques for estimating ventilation rates in dwellings. The purpose of the standard is to ensure that different people carrying out calculations with the same input data will obtain the same result. This will allow the use of these results in energy, heating load, IAQ or other calculations. The methods proposed use two different techniques, an explicit and an implicit one. The explicit one involves more approximations, but can be carried out with a hand calculator. The implicit one requires the use of a computer. This paper explains the methods used, justifies the approximations made and gives examples of the use of the explicit method. These show that the explicit method gives results in good, but not perfect, agreement with experiment, and also that the method is simple to use.

A Probabilistic model of air change rate in a single family house based on full-scale measurements has been developed. The probability of air change rate exceeding certain prescribed limits (risk of improper ventilation or excessive heat flow) is evaluated by utilising the distribution function based on calculated air flow rate. In this way the results are expressed in terms of the R-S model generally used in the safety analysis of structures. In particular, the probability of excessive and/or insufficient air infiltration can be expressed in terms of safety index BETA to describe the reliability of the building with respect to natural ventilation. The probability density functions for the air change rate have been established for different wind directions. Two methods of reducing the risk of unhygienic conditions have been studied. The first one is based on introducing extra small openings uniformly distributed over the building envelope and providing a fully naturally ventilated system. The second method consists in introducing mechanical exhaust ventilation system coupled with natural ventilation. Probability distributions of air change rates have been analysed for these two cases.

System safety of the performance of mechanical ventilation systems can of course be analysed by means of general methods for system safety analysis. Such methods are used a lot in industrial practice, especially in manufacturing industry. However applications on ventilation systems are more or less non-existing today. This paper summarises today's methods for system safety analysis and shows possible future ways of applying the methods on performance analyses of mechanical ventilation systems.

Although the power law has been broadly accepted in measurement and air infiltration standards, and in many air infiltration calculation methods, the assumption that the power law is true over the range of pressures that a building envelope experiences has not been well documented. In this paper, we examine the validity of the power law through theoretical analysis, laboratory measurements of crack flow and detailed field tests of building envelopes. The results of the theoretical considerations, and field and laboratory measurements indicate that the power law is valid for low pressure building envelope leakage.

Train tunnels and subways are an interesting field of ventilation. Trains move air through tunnels at rates of 600 m3/s which is much more than flow rates in buildings. Air pressures can vary up to some 3000 Pa leading to air velocities in the range of 10 to 50 m/s. This can lead to unsafe situations and thermal discomfort. The development of high speed trains causes more concern for better tunnel design. Modern stations often house small shops and restaurants, that require lower air velocities for thermal comfort. A dynamical ventilation model has been made to study effects of improvements. An array of controlled fans seems to be a very effective draught remover. The dynamical model is programmed to serve as a demo to give insight in the matter and can be shown in just a couple of minutes from a PC. A copy can be requested via e-mail to J.Phaff@bouw.tno.nl Subject: Train Demo. This demo version is just intended for demonstration purposes and must not be used for the design of real tunnels.

A study of the reliability of systems by considering the ability of different systems to maintain a required air flow rate over time is included in a subtask of IEA Annex 27 "Evaluation and Demonstration of Domestic Ventilation Systems". Measurements and calculations were performed to determine the variation in ventilation rates due to variation in climate and variation in performance of the ventilation system. Dwellings with passive stack, mechanical exhaust and mechanical exhaust-supply ventilation, representative of the Swedish housing stock, were studied. Diagnostic tests were carried out, to discover if the installed ventilation system was functioning as designed and to determine certain values eg characteristics of inlets and outlets. The airtightness was tested. The air flows in mechanical ventilation were measured. The continuous monitoring included measurements in dwellings of overall and local (individual rooms) ventilation rates, and measurements of boundary conditions, during three different monthly periods. The ventilation rates were monitored using tracer gas; passive techniques for monthly averaging and constant concentration for hourly averaging. The measured ventilation rates were simulated using COMIS, a multi-zone air flow network model. The simulated and measured average total outdoor ventilation rates agree reasonably well, while there can be disagreement for hourly rates and individual rooms. This paper presents and discusses the measurements and the calculations and compares the two.

Natural ventilation is being applied to an increasing number of new buildings to minimise reliance on mechanical ventilation and so reduce emission of greenhouse gases. However, passive stack ventilation (PSV) systems are currently designed without incorporating heat recovery leading to significant wastage of energy. Heat recovery systems have not been used in naturally-ventilated buildings because the pressure loss caused by a conventional heat exchanger is large compared to the stack pressure and could cause the ventilation system to fail. In addition, the stack pressure decreases owing to reduction of the temperature difference associated with the heat exchange, although this problem can be lessened by appropriate siting of the heat exchanger to maximise the effective stack height. In this study, natural convective flow through PSV stacks were computed using CFD to determine the effect of the layout of heat-pipe assemblies as well as the effects of spacing and length of fins on reduction of flow rate through the stack. Among the layout patterns examined, the arrangement where the assemblies are placed in a pattern of an arrow facing the flow direction produced the least insertion flow loss. The flow loss due to the insertion of the heat pipe assemblies (IFL) was found to increase sharply with the number of fins and reached over 30% when only 4 fins were used. IFL also increased with fin length but the rate of increase reduced for larger fin lengths. Therefore, for a given total surface area of fins, using fins with a larger length causes less flow loss than fins with a smaller spacing.

The work described in this paper is aimed at predicting the local values of the ventilation effectiveness parameters of large industrial buildings by a technique which involves the use of computational fluid dynamics and multizonal modelling. A modelling technique is described and applied to a typical modern industrial building equipped with both, mixing and displacement ventilation systems. The results of modelling each of the above systems are presented and discussed. They provide an interesting insight into magnitude and spatial variations in local air change index that occur in the occupied space. The results also demonstrate how differences in ventilation strategy can result in distinctly different variations of ventilation effectiveness parameters. It is concluded that the modelling technique described may be used to provide important information about the air movement characteristics of buildings in terms of local air change index and also that it could prove to be a very useful design aid.

This paper describes the ventilation analysis undertaken during the design of a new music centre for which it was desired to avoid the use of air conditioning and conventional ducted mechanical ventilation. The main objective was to predict the thermal comfort of occupants in the centre's main auditorium during summertime performances. The analysis was done using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and a dynamic thermal model. The CFD results were used to decide the size and location of openings for natural ventilation, which led to the final design having a much better distribution of incoming fresh air than the initial design. The peak fresh air ventilation rate was reduced, but this did not significantly increase the risk of summertime overheating. The dynamic thermal analysis predicted that the time when the temperature would be over 25 degrees C ranged from 0.3 performance hours/year with a dense concrete roof construction and an orchestra of 30 to 3.5 performance hours/year with a lightweight roof and an orchestra of 100. Given that the larger orchestra would not be formal and so could wear lighter clothing, it was concluded that natural ventilation should be a viable strategy for controlling the risk of summertime overheating. However, given uncertainties regarding the usage of the space and UK summertime temperatures in the future, it was recommended that provision was made in the design to enable mechanical cooling to be added at a later date.

This paper describes an experimental investigation into the operation of a modified Trombe wall. The construction has been altered to include a layer of insulation material; two alternative positions for this insulation layer have been considered and tested. Air flow from the top of the Trombe wall has also been enhanced by the inclusion of a low power axial flow fan which was controlled to function dependent on measured temperature in the wall cavity. The construction with exposed concrete facing into the air cavity has a slower response than that with exposed insulation facing the cavity. The concrete option also produces higher outlet temperatures, though the fan was found to operate for longer periods with the insulation option. The controller used could be developed for employment in more sophisticated control strategies.

This paper reports on work carried out at BRE to address the need for guidance on designing for natural ventilation via single-sided and cross-ventilation in office spaces and the limits of application on terms of plan depth. Present guidance suggests that natural ventilation will be adequate up to 6 m from the ventilating facade. This leads to the conventional design of offices up to 6 m deep on either side of a central corridor, giving as a rule of thumb a width of 15 m for a building with natural cross-ventilation. The present work looks at the opportunities for going beyond these rules of thumb. The implications for thermal comfort and draught risk are also assessed. In the conclusions issues such as, local ventilation rates, ventilating air penetration from a facade, the use of artificial mixing (eg ceiling fans) on hot days, the position of windows, and means of enhancing internal air speeds and air change rates are discussed.

Electric utilities in the Pacific Northwest have spent over $100 million to support energy efficiency improvements in the HUD-code manufactured housing industry in the Pacific Northwest over the past several years. Over 65,000 manufactured housing units have been built since 1991 that exceed the new HUD standards for both thermal performance and mechanical ventilation that became effective in October, 1994. All of these units included mechanical ventilation systems that were designed to meet or exceed the requirements of ASHRAE Standard 62-1989. This paper addresses the ventilation solutions that were developed and compares the comfort and energy considerations of the various strategies that have evolved in the Pacific Northwest and nationally. The use and location of a variety of outside air inlets will be addressed, as will the acceptance by the occupants of the ventilation strategy.

Since 1985 more than 170 very low energy houses, all of the same type and structure, were built in the Flemish Region, Belgium. Because conduction losses are very low, ventilation losses become very important, up to 45% of the heat losses if no heat recovery is utilised. Three of the houses were monitored in detail for energy consumption, energy and ventilation efficiency. All houses are equipped with the same ventilation system: balanced mechanical ventilation with heat recovery. Tracer gas measurements, pressurisation tests, multipoint temperature measurements and on site and laboratory tests of the heat recovery system, give us a complete scope of the ventilation system and its energy and ventilation efficiency. Pressurisation and depressurisation tests revealed the main air leaks in the construction: the different connections wall-floor and wall-roof, the window perimeter, even the sockets. Extra care in construction practice changed the n50-value from an average of 4.5 AC/h to 3.5AC/h, still high for a house with controlled ventilation. After testing the airtightness, we carried out tracer gas measurements in whole dwellings and between the different zones. Real ventilation rates and interzonal flows were derived. Questions like: Are the airflows in accordance with the design values? Do they match the requirements? How can we measure interzonal flows with one tracer? were answered. The paper gives a mathematical description of the tracer gas flow patterns (solution of the differential flow equations) and compares the results with the measured data. To complete the evaluation we carried out laboratory tests and field measurements on the heat recovery system. In laboratory the flat plate cross-flow heat exchanger showed a thermal efficiency up to 65% under specific climate conditions. In the dwellings, insulation and airtightness of the ducts appeared to be very important. The temperature efficiency decreased to values less than 45%. As a conclusion, one may stress that a global evaluation of the ventilation efficiency has to include different tests. The medium or poor airtightness has the greatest impact on the energy efficiency of heat recovery and on the ability to control the system. Detailed testing also showed some flaws in the ventilation system and in the building construction.

Ventilation by displacement is a type of ventilation where the air flow is thermally driven. By this arrangement one obtains two zones in the room - a lower zone with supply air conditions and an upper recirculation zone with extract air conditions. Cold climate causes downdraught from windows and external walls and results in a mixing of air from the upper into the lower zone. To avoid this problem during cold climate a new principle for ventilation by displacement is tested. Excess heat from the upper zone of the room is used for heating cold surfaces. The principle involves creation of a narrow space in front of the exterior wall, separating the cold wall from direct contact with room air. Extract air from the ceiling level is forced down through this space by an extraction fan. This method can advantageously by applied in large buildings where an external wall mainly consists of glass panes. In this case it might be appropriate to utilise the space between the inner couple of glasses for extract air. Tracer gas and temperature measurements were carried out in a test-room. The result shows that the ventilation efficiency improves when using the new principle. The thermal climate also improves due to less down-draught and higher surface temperatures.

Many dwellings with natural or gravity ventilation systems suffer from poor airchange rates. In Sweden, especially houses built in the 1960-ies and 1970-ies heated with electric resistance heating and thus without chimneys, are at risk. Improving the airchange rate in these houses is to some extent performed to decrease Radon gas concentrations where appropriate. For comfort, most homeowners learn to live with low airchange rates, accepting eg odours or window condensation and trying to compensate this with increased airing. They are often reluctant to install mechanical ventilation systems. This paper describes a new concept for an occupancy-controlled exhaust air ventilation system. The system features bedroom night-time ventilation, wet-room day-time ventilation and variable total air flow at a low installation cost. The system has since autumn 1994 been successfully installed in four houses and evaluated by air flow measurements, tracer gas tests, multizone airchange calculations etc. The homeowners are very pleased with the performance of the systems and the improved airchange rates.

Especially in modern buildings with small capacity of humidity storage it is necessary to reduce the humidity in the supply air. Normally this was done by using a refrigeration system mostly with CFC's. There are some alternative fluids available, but mostly they show a high global warming potential. All these systems need electrical energy to be driven and therefore it is necessary to consider other possibilities with alternative systems. The most promising systems are sorptive systems that are used now in open cycles. In these systems the air is dehumidified by a liquid sorbent and cooled indirectly by evaporating water in an open circuit. In order to calculate the process of absorption on several conditions, computer based calculations are required. A model that describes the dehumidification process is introduced.

Traditional air-handling unit (AHU) control systems link the position of the exhaust air damper, recirculation air damper, and outdoor air damper. Tests at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) on a variable-air-volume (VAV) AHU have shown that air can enter the AHU through the exhaust air damper. This can negatively impact indoor air quality if the exhaust air duct is located near a pollution source. This paper presents a new control system for variable air volume AHU's that use volume matching to control the return fan. The new control system links only the position of the exhaust air damper and recirculation air damper. During occupied times, the outdoor air damper is in the fully open position. Simulation and laboratory results are presented to compare the new control system and a traditional control system. Several cases are simulated to examine the effect of damper sizing and system load on airflow in AHU's. The simulations demonstrate that the new control system can prevent air from entering the AHU through the exhaust air damper for conditions that the traditional control system cannot. A case demonstrating the limits of the new control system to prevent this phenomenon is included in the simulation results. The laboratory results provide further evidence that the new control system prevents air from entering the AHU through the exhaust air damper for conditions that cause the phenomenon with the traditional control system.

Wind pressures can significantly affect ventilation performance. However often they are overlooked in the design of a naturally ventilated building, with buoyancy forces presumed to offer the worst case scenario for design. The result is that airflow patterns and the ventilation performance of the building is often different from the design intent. Successful natural ventilation design requires careful consideration of the building form, and so must involve the architect at the early stages of fabric development. Whilst devices and features may be used to enhance the performance of ventilation outlets, the wind flows at inlets are more likely to be affected by the form of the building, and less amenable to improvement by small devices. Performance may be improved by larger features that in effect become part of the building form itself. Therefore the designer requires a greater awareness of the effect of wind on natural ventilation. They may require access to targeted design information and design tools that are as yet generally unavailable.

Water use is distributed throughout building structures. Energy used to pump the water to higher levels in the building is not currently recovered, and is dissipated by performing work on air in the ventilation system which is vented to the atmosphere, when the water is discharged into the drainage stack. This energy can be utilised productively, however, by strategically placing the air inlet for the drainage stack inside the building, thereby utilising the potential energy stored in the water to draw air through the building. Airflow induction by falling water films is a well known problem in the drainage industry, and airflow rates of 10-20 times the water flow rate are common. Basic analysis of the ventilation requirements for typical large buildings suggest that this may contribute between 1 and 7.5% of the total ventilation requirement. Air admittance valves would be effective at isolating the habitable space from the waste water.

The suitability of night ventilation for cooling for the UK is first assessed by presenting plots of summer weather data on the bioclimatic chart for three locations within the country. These indicate that most of the external weather conditions lie within the thermal mass and ventilation effectiveness areas of the charts. To confirm this, thermal simulations of a typical office module under a variety of internal conditions and summer weather data were performed. Predictions have shown that internal temperatures can be maintained below the external values for solar and internal gains of up to about 50W/m2. Field measurements in a refurbished natural ventilated office have confirmed that temperatures in night ventilated spaces are generally lower during the following day, especially during the early hours of the working day. Finally, the development of a pre-design tool in the context of IEA Annex 28 on 'Low Energy Cooling Systems' is discussed. The main aim of the tool is to increase the awareness of designers for the energy benefits and the range of parameters for the application of night ventilation as the first means of cooling so that the need for artificial cooling is minimised or avoided altogether.

Research on this topic included experimental and modelling work aiming to fill the existing gaps in our knowledge of indoor air conditions in naturally ventilated buildings. Experiments were carried out in full scale and test cell facilities during the summer period. Single sided and cross ventilation as well as air flow through large internal openings were the basic topics that were studied. Existing models were validated and new ones were developed. A new computational tool for ventilation prediction was developed, based on the airflow network modeling. An intermediate approach, between network and CFD was proposed to take into account the impact of non-homogeneity on the indoor air motion.

Wind towers (scoops situated on the roofs of buildings to catch the wind) have been in use for centuries in the Middle east and Pakistan, to provide ventilation and cooling with minimal mechanical plant. In Europe, the problem of cooling buildings has generally not been significant, but in recent years there has been a trend towards substantial increases in internal heat gains from IT equipment etc and overheating in summer has become one of our major concerns. This has been dealt with by the use of air conditioning, but in many instances this could be avoided by making better use of natural ventilation through wind towers. This paper reviews the use of wind towers for cooling spaces, and reports on work currently being carried out, using wind tunnel tests on scale models, to examine the adaptation of these principles for use in modern office buildings, in order to avoid expensive air conditioning.

One of the main aspects determining the thermal behaviour of buildings concerns the distribution and circulation of air. Experimentation was undertaken in the context of the investigation of a method of measurement of the natural ventilation of large rooms. The first objective was to endeavour to characterise the atmospheric conditions around the building, namely, conditions related to wind factors, but also those concerned with the location of the building in relation to neighbouring obstacles (other buildings, relief of the ground, etc). The relationship between the concentration of a tracer and the ventilation system was then studied, using various hypotheses. The aim of the experimentation was to define a method, based on selection of tracer, homogenisation of the atmosphere and representativeness of measurements. The research resulted in the determination of a practical method.

Knowledge on the variation of the air change rate in dwelling as a function of time can be useful information. The most straightforward approach is the use of active tracer gas techniques. Unfortunately, such techniques are heavy and quite expensive. An alternative approach has been developed by combining results obtained by passive ventilation methods (PFT technique) with the approach used in the LBL method. The LBL method, developed at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratories, allows to estimate for single zone buildings the air change rate as a function of wind speed and temperature difference. Input parameters are some basic information on the leakage distribution, the height of the building, wind shielding etc. The method presented in this paper makes used of the outcome of the passive tracer gas method (which is an approximation of the average air change rate during the measurement period) and the following information on the building: relative proportion of leakage in floor and ceiling, height of the building and shielding data. NO information on the building airtightness (e.g. n50) value is needed. The approach has been applied on the PLEIADE dwelling, which is a low energy dwelling in the neighbourhood of Brussels. The results are promising. An additional advantage of the method is that it allows to correct for the averaging error of the PFT method which is unavoidable (the average air change rate is not the inverse of the average concentrations of the tracer gas).

A new technique is presented for measuring air exchange rates and contaminant transfer dynamics in buildings. The method uses pseudo-random binary sequences (PRBS) to control tracer gas injection. Cross-correlation of the injection sequence with the tracer concentrations measured in multiple rooms is used to deduce system responses. Air flow rates in multiple room buildings can be measured simultaneously using a single tracer. Both dynamic air change rates and static flow rates can be determined, and bad mixing can be diagnosed and quantified. Traditional techniques for tracer gas testing are reviewed followed by a derivation of the new method. Numerical simulation trials of the technique are described, the first for a simple one room configuration, the second for the same situation with experimental noise added, and the third for a three room building. The results obtained by cross-correlation agree with the known impulse responses and air change rates providing a first proof of concept for the method. A subsequent paper will describe validation of the method in a multiroom test chamber.

<P>
This report contains the results of air tightness testing of 11 log homes of various construction details, sizes and ages in the region of Eastern Ontario and Western Quebec. Two other air tightness studies one from Idaho 1993 and the other Minnesota 1990 agreed that it was possible to air seal a log home to a minimum standard, that the quality of the assembly appeared to play a role, air infiltration was a bigger problem than air leakage, lateral joints were not always the major air leakage areas but rather, corner, window/door assemblies and log to framing connections. Although the small sample prevents drawing scientific conclusions, the report indicated the following: Sealing (chinking) the exposed face of the log joints increased air tightness about an order of magnitude compared to a double line of caulking between logs. The same was generally true for air sealing joints at window and door openings. It should be noted that the test method may have had some influence on this finding as it was not possible to place the test box tight against the internal air seals. The air tightness of round V-scribe and hand hewn log construction was tighter than expected indicating that craftsmanship is a factor in developing air tightness. Tightening down gasketed walls with through bolts can maintain air tightness as shrinkage occurs. Various techniques for accommodating settlement appear to be working well.

This paper reports the results of an investigation into air flow from basements and sub-floors into the living space and shows that air infiltration from these areas makes a significant contribution to the whole house air infiltration rate. Experimental work in two typical test sites, using tracer gas techniques confirmed that contaminated soil gases may be transported into the living space by air from basements and sub-floors. The poor condition of most basements exacerbated the difficulty of practical methods of measuring airflow through basement ceilings.

Twin-facade systems represent an excellent attempt to fulfil energy conservation and emission reduction requirements. Using twin face facades makes it possible to ventilate rooms in high rise buildings which are more exposed to wind loads with ordinary windows, and reduce the need for air conditioning. The article describes the planned twin face system of one of the buildings at the Daimler Benz Project at the Potsdamer Platz in Berlin. In model tests the ventilation rate of the facade was investigated by simulating the thermal forces governing the phenomenon of natural ventilation. Ventilation rates for different flap configurations of the outer facade and different window openings are given. The investigations show that natural ventilation can be achieved even in cases of extreme wind or high solarisation. By considering the average temperature and wind data it can be demonstrated that the operation of the air conditioning plant can be reduced to a few weeks per year, with a matching reduction in energy consumption.

This study presents a zonal model used for predicting the air temperature distribution inside a room. This model is original in the calculation of mass air flows between two zones. To do so, we distinguish zones where the momentum is small and for which we calculate the flow rates with aid of a pressure field, and the driving zones described using appropriate specific flow laws. A comparison between experimental results and those obtained with the model proves that they are fully consistent with each other. This allows us to consider the integration of this type of model into a general building thermal code.

Turbulent air flow fields for an unflanged rectangular opening were calculated numerically using the standard k-e turbulence model. The accuracy of the calculations was verified by experimental laser Doppler anemometer velocity measurements and by comparison with previous empirical centre-line velocity equations. The results show that the air flow into an unobstructed exhaust hood can be predicted quite accurately provided that the calculation grid and the calculation domain are properly chosen.

Single sided natural ventilation configurations are very frequent especially in building in urban environments. Four single sided ventilation experiments were carried out in a full scale outdoor Test Cell facility. Air velocity measurements were taken at various heights in the middle of the opening. The average air flow rate through the opening was derived by using the tracer gas decay technique. This work presents the results of an investigation into the relationship between the air velocity at the opening and the bulk air flow rate measurements. The paper presents description of the experimental set-up as well as a qualitative discussion of the results.

A detailed experimental evaluation of the velocity fields induced in the proximity of local exhaust hoods with circular and rectangular (right quadrilateral) openings is presented. It contains a comprehensive description of the purpose-built test facility, of the measurement instrumentation adopted, and of the experimental procedure in use. Results show that, for a given opening shape, the velocity fields are quite different for flanged or plain hood opening. Fluid-dynamic asymmetries, probably caused by possible instability phenomena (fluid stream attachment) and by the influence of external supports or objects, are also observed.

A comparison between the main current formulas available in the literature, and the experimental results collected by the authors, is introduced and discussed. The predicted centerline velocities inferred from the recommended formulas are compared with the ones experimentally measured by the authors, for both plain and flanged free standing circular and rectangular exhaust openings. The velocity field outside the axis of the exhaust hood is also presented. It was experimentally determined and is expressed in terms of velocity contours.

The objective of this study was to assess the magnitude and balance of mechanical ventilation in the rooms of Helsinki metropolitan office building with different types of ventilation systems. A random sample of 50 office buildings was selected from the Building Registry. Of these buildings, the 33 that have a mechanical ventilation system were included this study. Most office buildings in the Helsinki metropolitan area have a ducted supply and exhaust system and hot water radiator heating. Air recirculation is used in about half of the buildings which have a mechanical supply and exhaust system. The average exhaust air=flow was 1.2L/s,m square (SD 0.73) or 17.2l/s per person (SD 11.6) The variation of the airflows was found to be very high among the buildings, and among the rooms within the buildings. Therefore, even though the ventilation rates on average comply with the Finnish building code, it was found that many people were working in offices with airflows which were either too low or unnecessarily high.

Several tools enable a more or less detailed description of the general ventilation and the local exhaust ventilation in industrial premises. An intermediate approach between predictive numerical simulation and experimental determination of classical aerodynamic parameters may be based on the Residence Time Distribution theory commonly used in chemical engineering. This paper deals with results for configurations composed of a cabin with a general ventilation system (one air inlet and one air outlet ensuring a high air removal rate) and a local exhaust ventilation (one air outlet above the working area). A model is built up from a combination of elementary volumes representing the ideal flow regions such as plug flow, perfectly mixed cell and perfect mixing cell in series. The fitting of the model is carried out by comparing the model response and the experimental response of tracer gas impulse injected in the room inlet. A satisfactory description of the air flow pattern has been found for the local exhaust ventilation and general ventilation. This approach seems to be promising enough to encourage further investigations.

Laboratory an numerical experiments were conducted in order to study the flow within an isothermal parallelepipdic test room. The air is injected through a complex diffuser (made of 84 nozzles) near the ceiling and is evacuated through a rectangular exit just below the inlet. Measurements were performed on a hydraulic model at one sixth scale. The parameters were determined according to a Reynolds similitude. Both laser Doppler anemometry and flow visualization were used. Numerical simulations were carried out using the EOL-3D software developed at the Institute National de Recherche et de Securite.

Natural convection from windows occur at winter conditions. Down-draft is especially experienced to cause thermal discomfort near the high window facades used in large enclosures, like atria. In the present work, strategies and methods for down-draft prevention are reviewed and discussed. Further, a special strategy ,and a calculation method are applied for design for a 25.5 m high glazed facade exposed to an outdoor temperature of -22 degrees C. Extended window crossbars and a heated vertical air flow, issuing from a slot, are used in the design solution.

Air flow patterns and indoor climate were explored in a production hall, where containers and furnaces for paper and pulp industry and chemical industry were fabricated. Welding fumes and other particulates generated by welding and related processes were aimed to control by the displacement ventilation. The supply air was introduced through seven low impulse diffusers mounted on the floor level against one long wall. The air was exhausted by two roof fans. The supply air distribution was characterized with tracer gas measurements using a step-down procedure. However, the homogeneous initial concentration was not reached due to notable infiltration flows. Concentration of sulphur hexafluoride which served as a tracer was measured with two photoacoustic analyzers connected to multi-point sampling units. In addition, contaminant concentrations and thermal parameters were monitored at several sites in the hall. The local age values measured at different points in the occupied zone and at different heights indicated that the displacement flow behaviour was achieved. This observation was supported by vertical temperature distribution.. There were problems, however, in achieving the displacement flow patterns in the morning when the ambient air in the hall was slightly cooler than the supply air.

Application of Computational Fluid Dynamics to building services design is illustrated and reviewed. Principal areas of application are designs requiring an understanding of the air flow pattern, such as design of smoke control systems and air distribution in a heating, ventilation and air conditioning system. In such an approach, the indoor air motion is described by a set of partial differential equations describing conservation of mass, momentum, enthalpy and chemical species concentration, if any. The air flow pattern, temperature contour, and chemical species concentration distribution induced by thermal sources are predicted by solving that system of equations using the finite difference method. Assessment of the longitudinal ventilation in a tunnel, smoke filling in an atrium, and the interaction between the air flow induced by a fire and a sprinkler water spray are illustrated in the area of fire engineering. Simulation of the combustion process is briefly reviewed. Calculation of the macroscopic flow parameters in an air conditioned gymnasium and an office is demonstrated.

In the near future a large number of dwellings in Switzerland dating from the 50s to the 70s will need to be retrofitted in order to upgrade the comfort levels to today's standards and to reduce the energy consumption. By carrying out an overall retrofit of both the envelope of the building and the building services this can be successfully accomplished. Two retrofit projects of apartment blocks, one in Meilen and one is Cossau, demonstrate how a well balanced strategy can achieve a comprehensive and economical retrofit.

Energy consumption data from 158 Hellenic hotels and estimated energy savings that result from the use of practical retrofitting techniques, material and new energy efficient systems are presented. The data were collected during an extensive energy audit of buildings that was carried out in Hellas, with the frame of a National Energy Programme sponsored by the CECVALOREN Programme, for energy conservation in buildings. During this short monitoring campaign and on-site visits of a trained panel of engineers to each building, all information related to the building's construction, heating, cooling and lighting systems, and all other mechanical and electrical systems, was collected. The main results and energy characteristics of cooling, heating and lighting on energy consumption and performance are discussed. The annual average total energy consumption in hotels is 273kWh/m squared, one of the highest amount all categories of buildings. Several scenarios for possible interventions to the buildings' outer envelope, heating, cooling and lighting systems are proposed and evaluated, in order to asses the effectiveness of various energy conservation techniques. Based on the results from several simulations, it is concluded that it is possible to reach an overall 20% energy conservation.

In this project the effect of appliance efficiency on the overall residential end-use energy consumption and subsequent atmospheric emissions of carbon dioxide in Canada is studied based on simulation studies conducted on the Expanded STAR database using the ENERPASS building simulation program. In addition, the effect of fuel substitution for space and domestic hot water heating on residential end-use energy consumption and atmospheric emissions is also evaluated. To conduct this study, first the CMHC STAR database was reviewed, modified and expanded to develop the Expanded STAR database. The new database exists in three formats which can be used with different building energy simulation programs and is considered acceptably representative of the Canadian housing stock at the national level, though not so at a regional level. As such, it is a valuable tool to study the impact of almost every energy conservation and electrical demand reduction option on the residential end-use energy consumption in Canada. The findings of this study clearly indicate that improving appliance efficiency reduces the overall end-use energy consumption in the residential sector as well as the associated carbon dioxide emissions. However, the magnitude of the savings as a result of improving only appliance efficiencies is quite small, in the 1-2 percent range. Significantly larger savings, in the order of 5-10 percent, can be obtained by improving house envelopes and heating/cooling systems in addition to improving appliance efficiencies. The effect of fuel substitution on residential energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions was also studied, and the results indicate that depending on the fuel substitution scenario adopted, there can be a significant potential to reduce residential end-use energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions. The Expanded STAR database and the methodology developed here can be used to easily predict the effect of fuel substitution scenarios.

A large percentage of South Africa's population is at present in low-cost dwellings. Furthermore, more than 2 million new houses must be built over the next 10 years to alleviate the current housing shortage. Unfortunately the existing houses are very energy inefficient and if nothing is done now, the new houses will surely also be inefficient. It would have a tremendous impact on the inhabitants' disposable income, health as well as their environment if these low-cost houses could be made energy efficient. This prompted the authors to investigate retrofit options to improve energy efficiency of existing houses and to evaluate energy efficiency design concepts for new houses. The energy efficiency of the improvements was evaluated by means of computer simulations. Ceiling insulation was found to be the best retrofit for the typical formal low-cost house. By retrofitting existing formal low-cost houses with insulation integrated ceiling the Gauteng region could save $12 million in electricity costs per year and around $0.79 billion in peak demand electricity supply. If the proposed new houses are supplied with insulation integrated ceiling the Gauteng region could save approximately $2 million in electricity costs per year and $224 million in peak demand electricity supply.

Adjustment of ventilation rates in buildings is widely practiced, both to provide good air quality on a proactive basis and to mitigate air quality problems associated with occupant complaints. However, both cross-sectional and experimental epidemiological studies have reported mixed results and have for the most part failed to establish definitive relationships between ventilation rates and symptom prevalence or dissatisfaction with air quality. The difficulties involved in establishing such relationships may be due to a variety of confounding factors which include limitations in study design and interaction effects; difficulties in controlling ventilation rates in experimental studies; inadequate mixing of supply air in occupied spaces; high source strengths for some contaminants; dynamic interaction between sources and ventilation rates that result in increased contaminant emissions; contaminant dose-response sensory effects which are log-linear; potential contaminant generation within ventilation systems themselves; and multifactorial genesis of sick building symptoms. There is limited evidence to suggest that ventilation rate increases up to 10 L/s person may be effective in reducing symptom prevalence and occupant dissatisfaction with air quality and that higher ventilation rates are not effective. Because of complex relationships between ventilation rates, contaminant levels, and building-related health complaints/dissatisfaction with air quality, the use of ventilation as a mitigation measure for air quality problems should be tempered with an understanding of factors which may limit its effectiveness.

A study was undertaken to investigate the use of mass balance modelling techniques to predict air pollution concentrations in residential settings where the source is evaporative emissions of alternative fuels emitted in the attached garage. Known quantities of methanol were allowed to evaporate in the garage, then measured and simulated using a multizonal mass balance model (CONTAM88). The study found that evaporative emissions in an attached garage have a tendency to infiltrate the house, with rooms adjacent to the garage showing the highest levels of methanol concentrations. Thus automotive evaporative emissions may represent a source of indoor pollution and human exposure in a residential attached garage and also in other critical locations of the residence.

Carbon monoxide (CO) detectors are being used increasingly in residential buildings to warn occupants about CO concentrations that could potentially cause acute health effects. While the use of CO detectors can decrease the likelihood of exposure to such CO levels, questions exist concerning the installation of these devices in residential buildings, primarily with regards to the location and number of detectors. Efforts to develop installation guidance and standards have been faced with these questions of location, and the availability of technical information to support the development of installation recommendation has been questions. As the first task of a project to analyze the distribution of CO in residential buildings as it relates to the installation of CO detectors, a literature review and technical analysis was conducted to assess information on CO dispersion in residential buildings that could support the development of guidance on detector installation. The review covered a number of issues including CO concentration measurements in residential buildings, sources of indoor CO, mixing within and between rooms, tracer gas techniques for assessing building airflow, and computer models of air movement and contaminant dispersal in buildings. The material obtained in the literature review is discussed, and a technical analysis of the issues related to CO dispersion in residential buildings is presented.

Focus is put on aerosol source parameters and their influence on aerosol dispersion and capture by a local exhaust. The studied parameters were particle diameter, density, and initial velocity. Included in the study was the influence of obstacles and airflow patterns. Direct capture efficiency of an exhaust above the contaminant source was used to compare the influence of the studied parameters. The study was based on a numerical model that computes the particle trajectories, taking inertia, drag forces, gravity, and turbulence into account. The relevance of particle relaxation time, aerodynamic diameter, and stopping distance is discussed. It is concluded that local exhaust capture of passively emitted particles can be described by particle relaxation time and the vertical air velocity at the emission point. The influence on direct capture from particle initial velocity is limited compared to imposed airflow patterns as jets and cross drafts. A table underneath the contaminant source may improve capture efficiency. The numerical model proved to be a useful tool to handle the complexity of contaminant sources in the industrial division.

A CFD analysis of air movement and aerosol particle deposition and distribution in a ventilate two-zone system with a small interzonal opening is presented. The comparisons of average particle concentrations in both zones between computations and experiments are generally satisfactory and acceptable. It is concluded that particle deposition and migration are mainly influenced by the particle properties, the ventilation conditions and the airflow patterns in the two zones. Small particles have a greater influence on the indoor air quality than do the large particles.

In-vehicle concentrations of selected gosaline-derived volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and formaldehyde were examined on 113 commuters through suburban New Jersey and 33 New Jersey/New York commutes. Overall median concentrations were lowest in a typical suburban commute, slightly higher on the New Jersey Turnpike, and the highest in transit through the Lincoln Tunnel. Median in-vehicle concentrations of benzene, ethylbenzene, m&p-xylene, and 0-xylene were 14, 6.8, 36, and 15ug/ m cube, respectively. One vehicle, with a carburetor engine, developed malfunctions that caused gasoline emissions within the engine compartment during driving, resulting in the gasoline-derived VOC concentrations in this vehicle being much higher than in the properly maintained fuel-injected vehicle, particularly for the low ventilation extreme. The highest in-vehicle benzene concentration measured during these malfunctions was 45.2ug/m cube. The air concentration in the vehicle driven in tandem was a factor of 25 less (1.8ug/m cube).

Remedial measures to prevent soil gas infiltration have been implemented on many building affected by intrusion of radon, water vapor, methane and other volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The success of these measures has been well documented for gases such as radon, however similar detailed documentation was not readily available for methane or other VOCS. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of four different remedial solutions installed on houses. All houses tested in this study had the potential of methane intrusion. Nine houses were tested as part of this study. The four different remedial measures which were evaluated included: a liner with a subslab passive vent system; an active venting fan connected to a foundation perimeter gas collection pipe; a passive vent connected to a foundation perimeter gas collection pipe; and a liner system only. Each of these four systems were installed in four separate communities across Canada. Based on long-term monitoring, none of the nine houses tested were identified as having significant methane concentration indoors due to soil gas entry. Although the remedial measures installed may have had an effect on the limited amount of methane detected indoors, other factors such as low methane generation rates, and diffusion controlled sources also had significant influence. In fact, at some houses, the control systems likely were not necessary because of the factors. Further short-term tracer tests were carried out on one of the systems to evaluate the integrity of the remedial measure. Based on a limited number of houses tested, the results suggested that the amount of gas could be limited by as much as four orders of magnitude.

Concentrations of airborne particles and micro-organisms were assessed as a function of the air exchange rate in two operating theatres equipped with conventional air ventilation systems. The measurements were made with and without human activity (surgery). Under conditions without human activity the effect of the air exchange rate on viable (=micro-organisms) and non-viable airborne particles was measured. Under conditions with human activity an investigation was made to determine whether the air exchange rate has a significant influence on air-borne particle and bacteria concentrations. In addition, the influence of the number of persons in the operating theatres and the various operating activities were calculated. Statistical differences were found for airborne particle and airborne bacteria concentrations in supply and room air with and without human activity. From the point of view of hygiene, these differences must be considered irrelevant because of the slight margin (less than on e logarithmic step) between the values. A comparison of all air exchange rates clearly shows that the number of personnel present in the operating theatre exerts the strongest influence on airborne particle concentration variance in room air. As regards airborne bacteria concentrations in room air, explanation of variance by the parameters air exchange rate, number of persons and operating activity is negligible. Summarizing the low (7.5 and 10/h) and high (15 and 20/h) air exchange rates did not increase the explanation of variance for airborne particle and bacteria concentrations although the differences were significant.

Three ventilation systems were installed in a recently refurbished test house: full house mechanical ventilation with heat recovery (MHVR), passive stack ventilation (PSV) and extract fans in kitchen and bathroom. Humidifiers were installed to simulate normal occupancy and behaviour of the ventilation was monitored over the winter of 1993/94. The test house has a low leakage rate of 3 ac h-1 at 50 Pa pressure difference; this low rate was maintained over the duration of the tests. A comparison of ventilation rates provided by the three systems is given. MHVR was the most effective in maintaining low humidity.

The object of this parametric study is to make a contribution to the design of building elements in offices and other non-residential premises without occupant sensitive climatic control, and to put forward views regarding heating strategy. Cooling is discussed here only as passive cooling, i.e. cooling which can be achieved by making use of the building itself and its ventilation without the need to install refrigeration equipment. The need for cooling arises due to the architectural and structural design of the building. For instance, large southerly, easterly and westerly glazed areas demand solar control if active cooling is to be avoided. These are also dealt with in this study. The interest in offices and other working premises has increased in recent years die to the health problems which the users have experienced as a result of internal climatic conditions. It has generally been possible to trace back such ill-health to emissions from materials or to the ventilation system. Demands have been made for the supply of fresh air to be increased and for the effectiveness of ventilation to be improved. This has been taken into account in varying the parameters used in this study.

The paper briefly describes the AC pressurisation method of building airtightness measurement and the disadvantages of earlier analysis methods. A new analysis method is described, based on fitting a non-linear function of the unknowns to data. The function is derived from the differential equations of the system components. The new method performed well with simulated data. With real data, the method produced good estimates of the leakage flow rate at 4Pa pressure loss, leakage length/area and enclosure flexing, but poor estimated of the leakage exponent. it is suspected that this problem was due to measurement errors.

The AC pressurisation method of measuring the airtightness of building is briefly described. Using a simplified model, the leakage characteristics of the enclosure may be found by Fourier analysis of the pressure signal if the effects of compressibility and flexing are neglected. These effects become small at low frequency, but the frequency required to make them negligible may be too low for the available instruments and the resulting pressure signal may be smaller than appropriate for building airtightness measurements. The conditions under which the other approximations in the model may be justified are not yet know.

Discussion of ventilation standards in relation to the needs of health care, for example in operating rooms. Compares various ventilation standards. Concludes that air changes per hour would be the better predictor of patient exposure to contamination only if contamination were generated based on the volume of the patient room. A ventilation standard based on cfm per patient is likely to be more representative of expected contamination levels within a space than an air change per hour standard. The reason is that contamination sources are likely to be related to either the infactious patient themselves, or to patients, their visitors, and activities; while room volume is unlikely to be related to contamination sources.

In buoyancy driven, displacement ventilation, the incoming "fresh" air is gently introduced near the floor and at a temperature just slightly lower than the design room air temperature. The cool air flows slowly over the floor and air that has become warmed rises above the cool layer. Any local heat sources in the lower part of the room create convection currents that also contribute to the general upward movement and the air is ultimately exhausted at high level. Although this type of system has been used in other countries, notably in Scandinavia, since 1970, there is little experience of its use in the UK. This report contains state of the art information on the application of this method of ventilation and data appropriate to the design and operation in this country.

An existing derivation of capture efficiency of a kitchen range hood in a confined flow system, based on a two-zone mixing model, is shown to be inconsistent and inadequate. A new derivation proposed, which shows that the capture efficiency equals the ratio of captured flow rate to the total plume flow rate at the front canopy height. The new capture efficiency equals the direct capture efficiency, if we assume that the hood captures contaminant directly from the source as efficiently as it captures contaminant that is entrained from the room.

In non-industrial buildings the general ventilation is usually sufficient to ensure that fresh air is renewed at an adequate rate. Many industrial premises, on the other hand, have localised emissions of contaminants that require local exhaust ventilation. But in practice local exhaust systems may not be 100% efficient, allowing contaminants to escape and mix with the ambient air. Ventilation designers need tools to allow them to assess the efficiency of different arrangements. A new approach to ventilation design is being developed, based on the concept of residence time distribution. The method promises to be easier than modern computational fluid dynamics but more accurate than traditional "rule of thumb" techniques.

An underfloor air conditioning system designed for buildings with intelligent features was developed and introduced into a smart building in Tokyo. Laboratory experiments, numerical simulations, field measurement studies were carried out before and after occupancy, to estimate and confirm the level of thermal comfort and energy saving effects of the system. These studies revealed that, compared with the conventional ceiling diffuser air conditioning system, the underfloor air conditioning system not only promoted highly efficient exhaust heat removal, but also increased the rate of dependency on natural energy. It was confirmed that in the underfloor air conditioning system, exhaust heat was elevated upward, carried by the air flow that blew from the floor to the ceiling, and formed thermal layers. This meant that exhaust heat was effectively discharged from the occupied space. The studies revealed that supply air temperature of 20 Deg. C could sufficiently serve as supply air all year round. The length of period dependent on natural ventilation was extended and the annual energy consumption level monitored also proved this. The supply air with a higher temperature enabled a higher temperature for the chilled water, and resulted in a more efficient operation of the refrigerators. it was also found out that the underfloor air conditioning system could be easily integrated with a passive energy system (such as "night purge" that utilised natural ventilation) to form an effective hybrid energy system. As a result, this building consumed primary energy of 432 Mcal/h m2 during the fiscal year of 1994, which was quite small compared with other conventional smart buildings in Tokyo.

Evaporative cooling is used extensively for cooling climates with medium to low humidity. In residential buildings the conventional mechanical systems to be both noisy and unsightly. Here a proposal is presented fro a passive evaporative cooling system which makes use of natural ventilation at the building facade. The system makes use of the evaporative effect from water falling vertically along guides to produces a reduction in the temperature of the air entering the building. it can also be used as a design element in the building facade. Such a system provided an inexpensive, energy efficient, environmentally benign and potentially attractive cooling system. A numerical study is presented to demonstrate the system efficiency and air flow rate through a building, making use of measured outside wind speed and direction, building geometry and surroundings. The likely effect of the system on the indoor air temperature is discussed; further work is being undertaken to explore the integration of such a system into the building fabric.

The study was a part of an epidemiological health study among the school children. The total concentrations of airborne fungi in three problem schools were 5-530 cfu/m3 and in the reference school 21-160 cfu/m3. Certain fungal genera were only detected in the problem schools. This was true in both air and surface samples. The results also indicate that the children's entering the room increases the concentrations of airborne fungi. The concentrations of surface samples in the problem school were higher than in the reference school as well.

Allergen levels of mites were measured in dust from classrooms with carpeted and wooden floors in school by sandwich ELISA. Mite allergen levels in dust samples from open-style classrooms with carpeted floors were as low as those of conventional classrooms with wooden floors. Some conventional classrooms and closed-type music rooms with carpeted floors gave high mite allergen levels. The mite allergen levels were highest in July or August, the most humid and hottest seasons in Japan, and decreased in November. The dust mite levels correlated with humidity but not temperature. It was suggested that humidity was one of important factors which affected mite allergen levels in carpeted classrooms. Attention needs to be paid to the structure and the ventilation which have an effect on humidity, when carpet is installed on the floors of classrooms.

This paper presents preliminary results from the first nine months of monitoring the Oxford Solar House (OSH) which was built, in particular, to evaluate the potential for photovoltaics to contribute cost effectively to domestic energy supply in the UK. The house was built in a south facing site with good solar access. It has a 4kWPV system integrated into the roof structure and a 5 metre squared solar thermal domestic hot water pre-heat. The house was designed to require a minimum of energy for heating, cooling and lighting, therefore optimizing the significance of the contribution of the solar electric supply. The performance of the PV system is presented, as well as an analysis of the whole design strategy to minimized energy loads.

The traditional Yemeni window is considered to be one of the most important elements that characterize the yemeni architecture. The beauty of the traditional Yemeni window comes from its four main components which combined the function of view, lighting, ventilation, protection, and privacy. These functions can be controlled by the occupants according to their social and environmental needs. The four main components are the lower part (Taqah), the fanlight (Qamariyah), the wooden external overhang (Konnah), and the small vent (Shaquos). Since fanlights provided natural lighting during day-time, the area of the lower part can be reduced and its exterior shutters can be closed without the need for artificial lighting. The internal natural lighting that is provided by the upper and lower parts of the window was investigated see its quality. In this investigation, there were two main goals. The first is the contribution and quality of the internal light provided by the Qamariyah when shutters are closed. The second is the effect of the internal simple white cloth curtains, in the lower part,in the internal light quality. Visual measurements were taken in a typical room of a traditional house of the Old City of Sana's, Yemen. From the findings, it was found that the fanlights (Qamariyat) provide low and soft homogeneous internal lighting which was as low as 22 lux average. However, the occupants have the ability to increase the level of lighting to as high as 600 or 700 lux. This can be done simply by deciding which shutter to open and how many of them to be opened. In this paper, the methodology and findings will be presented and discussed.

The heating or cooling of a space to maintain thermal comfort is a highly energy intensive process accounting for as much as 60-70% of total energy use in non-industrial buildings. Of this, approximately 30-50% is lost through ventilation and air infiltration. A recent review concludes that as the thermal insulation characteristics of buildings improve, ventilation and air movement are expected to become the dominant heating and cooling loss mechanism in buildings of the next century. While it is theoretically possible to reduce the energy impact of ventilation by restricting the rate of air change, this can have a dramatic influence on indoor air quality. On the other hand, there are many instances where air change is excessive or ventilation is called upon to deal with air quality problems that should be treated in other, less energy intensive ways. Only by understanding the role of ventilation and alternative control strategies can ventilation energy demand be optimised without causing harm or discomfort. The purpose of this paper is to review aspects of indoor air quality as they relate to the ventilation of commercial buildings. Also outlined is a variety of energy efficient approaches to ventilation.

The air movement and the distribution of CO2 in naturally ventilated office room and an atrium is investigated using computational fluid dynamics. The results show that natural ventilation is capable of achieving acceptable CO2 levels. Adequate comfort levels could also be achieved for a typical UK summer climate in both types of buildings.

The suitability of night ventilation for cooling is first discussed by presenting a plot of summer weather conditions on the bioclimatic chart by reporting on the results of energy and ventilation simulations of a typical UK office module. The development of a simplified design tool suitable for the early stages of design process is then described. For this model, user input is limited to a few key variables and the technique allows the designer to explore rapidly the effects of a range of design variables including external temperatures, internal gains and ventilation rates during the day and night.

A CFD software called VORTEX is used as a tool to simulate air flow and thermal comfort in naturally wind ventilated classrooms of an educational institution, which are a different locations, have different configurations and slightly differing outdoor environmental conditions. Simulations of the various classrooms are compared to get the most thermally comfortable and uncomfortable naturally ventilated classroom. An analysis of the simulations will be done, taking into consideration, among other, location of inlets and outlets and the sheltering effect of the surrounding built-up environments. Recommendations will then be made on how to improve the ventilation of the least comfortable room, based on hypothetical simulation results.

The paper discusses the possibility of offering thermal comfort, without inducing mechanical energy costs, in new habitations, built in European style and situated in a hot and humid climate, by means of a construction elements: the Roof Solar Collector (RSC), which is made by using concrete roofing tiles on the outer side and gypsum board on the inner one. With this RSC it is possible, on the one hand, to minimize the fraction of the solar flux absorbed by the dwelling (insulation) and, on the other hand, to induce a natural ventilation which allows thermal comfort. The influence of length and tilt angle of the RSC on the performance of the RSC is studied experimentally. The results of the study, with regard to the natural ventilation of habitation, were that the optimum length of roof solar collector must be shorter than about 100 cm and the tilt angle should equal 30 degrees. The natural ventilation rate was about 0.08-0.15 m cubed s-1.m-2

Energy conservation in drying and processing operations is essential in order to improve the reliability of low and moderate temperature renewable energy system, and to reduce operating costs and energy consumption is systems using high-energy content fossil fuels in farms and processing plants especially in industrialized economics. An experimental evaluation of energy conservation potential by recirculating exhaust air in a commercial heated-air batch hay dryer is presented. The design of the exhaust recirculation unit is such that only about 30% of the total exhaust air is recirculated through the heater inlet. Experimental tests were conducted on the dryer with and without exhaust air recirculation. Maximum energy savings of 27% and 17% were achieved with exhaust air recirculation during fall and summer dryer operation respectively.

This paper describes the experimental set-up of a computerized data-acquisition system in the town of Shah Alam, Malaysia. The system utilizes sensors for the capture of global horizontal solar radiation, relative humidity of air, ambient air temperature, wind speed and direction. These parameters are then displayed and plotted directly on both the bio-climatic and psychometric charts. Some initial attempts are made to describe the typical climate of Shah Alam by interpreting the resultant points on the charts. Consequently, as more data is acquired over a considerable period of time, sufficient to describe the Shah Alam more accurately, passive design strategies for cooling to achieve local thermal comfort may be attempted.

The indigenous courtyard houses of Baghdad are effectively designed and built as two-houses-in-one micro-climatically and thermal-environmentally (as well as in other aspects). Essentially, the ground floor, the semi-subterranean level, the subterranean level, and the roof terrace at second floor level are designed and built for summer habitation, while the first floor (with its mezzanine level the Kashif-Kan) is designed and built for winter habitation. Additionally, habitable rooms and spaces of these indigenous courtyard houses in Baghdad are not designated for a specific function, purpose, or use: instead, they are envisaged as multi-purpose to be used for sitting, living, dining, sleeping, and some are even for receiving visitors. However, they are designated according to season when they are meant to be used mainly in winter or summer or alternatively in spring and autumn, \9and some are even designated for use at a particular time of the day within the same season, as discussed in another paper submitted to the Congress). In this paper, such habitable rooms and spaces are identified in plan, in location (floor level), and in section, and then related to their seasonal designation.

The use of passive solar cooling strategies offer real opportunities for improving the ambient comfort conditions in building whilst reducing the energy consumption due to the use of mechanical systems for space climatization. This research examines the potential of passive solar cooling strategies in an educational building. The alternatives proposed for investigation consisted of a wind tower system handling the temperature difference gradient and direct wind pressure effects. A new fenestration system on the south facade, implementation of an integrated energy efficient lighting system (including lamps, luminaries, ballasts and controls), and landscaping[ping features in a micro-climatic approach, to provide a pre-cooling effect, were also proposed as additional strategies. Results have shown that passive solar cooling has the potential to improve ambient comfort conditions in these type of building, dominated by large internal heat gain loads. Energy consumption die to electric lighting and mechanical space climatization was cut off by 60%. At this stage, and after the implementation of the techniques, monitoring of the ambient conditions will be conducted for a period of twelve months. It is also expected that the results of this research can be applied in other buildings with similar conditions in Mexico.

Extreme high an low summer and winter temperatures respectively in most parts of Botswana render the use of space conditioning devices mandatory. However, the use of such devices is not feasible in the low-cost housing sector, and the majority of the population face the severity of the climate. In this paper effects of passive solar building design parameters and building material on the indoor temperatures of a typical three bed-roomed, low-cost house are analyzed. By varying the design parameters and materials the mean-monthly maximum, minimum and average indoor temperatures without the use of space conditioning devices are simulated. An energy analysis software - CALPAS version 3 (1980) is used, and the parameters studied are the orientation, roof and wall insulation and colorful, glass area, thermal mass and ventilation. The conclusions drawn and the recommendations made provide guidelines for home-owners to construct thermally more comfortable passive solar houses without or with very little additional cost of construction. This paper and another one by Jain et al. (1996) in these proceedings share common information and data, and should be considered together.

In recent years two new ideas to design air-conditioning systems have spread very quickly in north-western Europe, displacement flow and cooled ceilings. These new air-conditioning systems are already frequently applied due to many advantages. There are many differences between this type of air flow compared with the better known mixed flow. Many questions arose about the design of the new systems: Dimensioning and location of the air outlets, influence of the thermal load, distribution of temperatures, velocities and concentrations in the occupied zone. Most of these questions are solved now and a survey about the design rules will be given and some applications will be shown.

Along with improvements of Chinese people's living standards, household air conditioners have already come into population's home right now. In order to evaluate the influence of air-conditioned ventilation upon indoor radon concentration in air, indoor radon levels were studied by a continuous electrostatic radon monitor (CER) under normal living conditions. Results show radon levels with air-conditioners were not much more than one in winter without it, although fixing household conditioner requires a sealed room which will lead higher radon levels. Turning on air-conditioner helps to lower it. Total effects are normal , ventilation , exhaust or indraft , exhaust plus indraft, and reduce the harm to human. In summary, air-conditioners are good for human health.

The purpose of this project is to examine the potential for backdrafting in ten houses having active soil depressurization radon mitigation systems installed and operating. As part of a State Innovative Radon Grant project supported by the State of Minnesota's Department of Health, we investigated the impact of radon mitigation system on house depressurization and backdrafting of atmospherically vented combustion devices. Ten houses were chosen in the Twin Cities metropolitan area that contain active radon mitigation systems. All had basements. Air leakage measurements of the houses showed a median air leakage of 6.0 air changes per hour at 50 Pascals pressure. Depressurization of the mechanical room relative to the outside was measured with the mitigation system off and in operation. The potential for backdrafting of the combustion equipment was also measured. We did not observe depressurization of the basements in any of the ten homes due to operation of the radon mitigation system. Worst-case depressurization was established by operating all exhaust equipment simultaneously. Worst-case depressurization caused backdrafting to occur in four of the ten houses. In one of the four the furnace began to draft after firing for three minutes. We tested the carbon monoxide production in the flues of each atmospherically vented combustion device during backdraft conditions. If the device did not experience backdrafting during the worst-case test, the backdraft was induced using a blower door. In tow of the ten houses elevated CO production was seen in one of the combustion appliances subject to backdrafting. Active soil depressurization systems did not add to backdrafting concerns in the houses tested.

The thermal environment was continuously monitored for one week in winter and one week in summer in 4 naturally ventilated (NV) air-conditioned (AC) UK offices. Occupants considered the NV offices to be comfortable across a wider range of temperatures than AC offices in winter, but the range was similar in summer. The neutral temperature in NV offices was 1.3 degrees C lower in winter and 2.2 degrees C lower in summer than in AC offices. However, there was only a marginal difference in clothing insulation and activity levels between the two types of office. Discrepancies of up to 4 degrees C were found between the observed neutral temperatures and those predicted by international standards ISO7730. thermal comfort, natural ventilation, air conditioning

We use the refuse-air heat from hot tools in industrial shop to preheat the fresh air for the space heating. There is the technology-steam discharge through the steam pipe openings into the industrial shop. For this reason we have used the simulation software AZMAP. This software is based on the mathematical modeling of this energy system via a heat exchange network. The higher diameter of the opening means the higher steam loss but higher energy savings needed for the space heating of the industrial building. The adjustment of the fresh air-mass flow to obtain the thermal comfort in the industrial shop means the additional energy savings up to 3%.

In cold climates, the temperature difference between vertical room surfaces and adjacent room air is capable of initiating cold downward convection flows, which are often intensive enough to create local drafts. An investigation of convection induced by a cold window was conducted in a climate chamber. The window faced an outdoor temperature of about -12 degrees C. A flat unit, placed horizontally below the window, was used to simulate floor heating. By measurements of the sir flow, the draft was investigated. THe result shows that the heating hardly affects the flow along the window surface, but gives considerable effects on the air current spreading over the floor. With the local air temperature increased and the local air velocity reduced, the near-floor draft can be greatly suppressed by floor heating. draughts, window, test chamber

This paper describes the thermal environment and indoor air quality of 16 well-insulated and airtight houses in Senai and Moriaoka during the winter and summer of 1994. These houses have mechanical ventilation system and space heating system for a whole house. The thermal environment during the winter was comfortable, but some occupants complained of dryness of indoor air. During the summer, the indoor temperatures of houses did not rise so much without the cooling system, and it seems possible to be improved by cross ventilation or night time ventilation. The NO2 concentration were not so high. The concentration of NO2 with an unvented kerosene heater was higher than that without it.

Field measurements on thermal comfort were carried out in a passenger terminal building at an international airport and an office building with a big atrium using an instrumental cart built for investigating thermal environment from outdoor to indoor in transient spaces. Numerical simulation based on these field data was carried out to evaluate thermal comfort for sedentary and transient persons by using a thermo-regulation model with 16 body parts. It was found that the mean skin temperature of the transient persons was higher than that of sedentary ones. It was proved that atrium was functioning not only for pleasant atmosphere but also for a thermal buffer.

Air conditioned buildings are becoming more and more associated with the negative aspects of environmental services design. They are generally regarded as associated with high energy use, high capital and maintenance costs and building health and comfort problems. One reason for the poor performance of air conditioning systems is the potential for short-circuiting of air between the various supply and exhaust locations. This means that the air that is delivered to the occupied zone is not as "fresh" as it was intended to be. This paper discusses the problem of short-circuiting of exhaust and supply air in air conditioned offices. It identifies three main short-circuiting situations, at external, intermediate and internal locations. Results from a number of case studies are presented to illustrate the problems that occur in practice. These results suggest that short-circuiting happens more often than perhaps previously thought, and that it may be fundamental to current problems associated with poor indoor air quality. Some recommendations are provided for good practice.

Transport equations of room ages of air determined from tracer step-up and step-down experiments are derived under the condition that each room air is completely mixed and each flow rate of building airflow network is constant. Based on the derived transport equations of room ages of air, a new evaluation method of flow rates of building airflow network is proposed with a suitable tracer gas experiment procedure. Proposed transport equations are validated by comparison to the age distribution of rooms calculated from numerically simulated tracer gas experiments. A series of tracer step-down experiments were carried out of full-scale model house together with the direct measurement of flow rates. It was found that the age distribution of rooms calculated from the measured flow rates, and reversibly evaluated flow rates from the measured age distribution of rooms were in good agreement with the experiments.

The objective of the paper is research on aerodynamical and thermal phenomena in rooms supporting or impeding two-zone air flow characteristic for displacement ventilation. The tests were carried out in scale models of an industrial hall. The power and location of the heat sources as well as the air volume flux in quasi-laminar sup[ply flows were changed as the boundary conditions of the modelled process of displacement ventilation. Distributions of the air temperature and of the tracer gas concentrations were measured. The flows visualized were recorded with a video camera. The effect of the ventilation boundary conditions on the creation of an inter-layer which divided the inflow zone and circulation zone. The characteristics of the inter-layer and interface were tested. Occurrence of two-zone flow in displacement ventilation systems is affected by the following depending on one another factors: plumes, supply flows, their position and other geometrical conditions of the room. These factors should be considered and optimized individually while maintaining, however certain proportions between the air change and power of the heat sources as well as the layered air flow within the whole lower zone.

During the surgical operations, both the necessity of lower energy consumption and a deeper consideration to the risks of post-operative sepsis need a new approach in the assessment of the ventilation requirements for the operating rooms. An Indoor Air Quality Procedure is used to discuss the sterility level attainable in these rooms during a surgical operation, for different ventilation rates and consistency of the medical team. Furthermore, their typical time dependent behaviour and the time of de-contamination are discussed.

The first UK experiment to utilize human sensory perception as a measure of an indoor air's acceptability took place in 1872. Since this time several important investigation have been carried out, using human arbiter, to determine the minimum ventilation rate required to maintain indoor air as acceptable. Humans, rather than instrumentation, have been preferred ad they can give both a quantitative and qualitative dimension to the judgments. However, qualitative judgments such as the pleasantness, annoyance or nuisance of odours and irritants will depend strongly on the context in which they are measured. Traditionally, "visitors" to buildings are employed to measure the acceptability of the indoor air as the occupants will have adapted to the ambient odour levels with the subsequent loss of sensitivity. This paper reports on the findings of an experiment that utilized occupants, a trained panel and an untrained panel to judge the indoor air in a large air-conditioned office building sited in central London. The evaluations took place over three weeks and the outside ventilation rates were reduced during the second and third weeks. All participants were "blind" to the changes in ventilation rates. Results suggest that the three groups' basis for acceptability judgments are very different and that the occupants' perception of "air quality" may be influenced by prior knowledge that the outside air is polluted which will inevitably effect the quality of the indoor air. Recommendations for standard methods of assessment of indoor air quality are presented based on the results from this study.

"L" MARKET - now under construction - is based on the "clean building philosophy". A main goal is to deliver an office complex of approx. 76.000 metres squared without debris and building dust, such as mineral wool, cement, sand or gypsum. Implementation of a building project which employs new innovative techniques, requires the total co-operation and participation of contractor and sub-contractors. Accordingly, great emphasis is placed on the education of contractors and the displacement of conventional attitudes and practices. Unless individual workers can be convinced of the basic value of following "clean" construction procedures, there is no possibility of achieving one of the principal objectives of the original environmental plan, which was made for "L" MARKET. We have to convince the workers that the "clean building philosophy" is a benefit for their comfort and health during the construction time.

The contamination of rooms after application of pyrethroid insecticides was investigated in this study. Three different formulations containing deltamethrin, permethrin, piperonylbutoxide and pyrethrins were sprayed in a model house consisting of ten identical furnished rooms and their concentration monitored on surfaces, in house dust and airborne dust over a period of two years. The concentrations of permethrin and deltamethrin decreased very slowly during this period. After 70 weeks, permethrin applied as a solvent-based emulsion was found in house dust in concentrations of 200ug/g, and deltamethrin applied as an aqueous suspension in concentrations of 5ug/g. Decontamination of the rooms using a household cleanser substantially reduced the pyrethroid concentration.

The rapid increasing of population in the world, becoming barren of the earth land, and the damage of ecology balance are forcing mankind to pay attention to the underground space again. But the severe indoor environment problems of underground space, such as temperature, humidity and ventilation, have not been well solved, though some documents about those problems have been reported in recent years, which will obstruct the exploitation and utilization of underground space. In this paper, an experimental natural ventilation system with dehumidification in terms of special construction element measures has been designed and built in underground space. Measurements of its thermal-moisture properties was taken in the summer of 1994. The results have been qualitatively or quantitative analyzed. It shows that this system is effective to some degree to improve the thermal-moisture performance in the underground space. Finally, some useful suggestions have been proposed to ameliorate this system.

The contribution made by diesel exhaust particles (DEP) to indoor air pollutants was evaluated on the basis of concentrations of elemental carbon (EC), a major component of DEP. Concentrations of suspended particulate matter (SPM: particles of &lt;10µm diameter) and EC in indoor and outdoor air were measured at 8 private homes located between 5 and 150 metres from a main road. Samples were collected using an AND sampler capable of separating airborne particles according to aerodynamic diameter (&lt;2µm, 2-10µm, and &gt;10µm). EC concentration in indoor air of homes located within 5 metres of the roadside was 25µg/cubic metre while that for homes located between 60 and 150 metres from the roadside was 17µg/cubic metre. The contribution of DEP to SPM of &lt;2µm diameter in indoor air was evaluated at approximately 43-64% for homes located within 5 metres of the roadside and at 41-61% for those 60-150m distant.

Airborne contaminants can easily be distributed by HVAC systems an dispersed in air. The control of microbioaerosols and particulate can be done partly by better design, installation, operation and maintenance of HVAC systems, This paper discussed the influence of ventilation and air-conditioning system and filtration provision to aerosols level in health care buildings. Particulate levels at selected areas with different ventilation rates, air side systems and filtration provisions in a newly built hospital in Hong Kong have been studied. It has been found that CAV may not perform better than VAV and 100% fresh air may not perform better than recirculatory system. Human activities and movement may have significant contribution to the particulate level in the fine size mode.

Sensation of draught is one of the most common reasons for complaints about thermal environment. It is therefore of interest to investigate correlation between the existing draught criteria and convective heat loss from the human body. The measurements were carried out with a thermal manikin head heated to simulate thermal comfort sensation for a human head under different environment conditions. The mean heat loss from the head was measured together with the local heat loss in four different positions. The corresponding convective heat transfer coefficient was calculated for the air velocity between 0 and 0.4 m/s, turbulence between 10 and 70% and frequency between 0 and 1 Hz. The air temperature and mean radiant temperature were kept constant around 20.5 degrees C. The main result was that, generally, the increase in convective heat loss caused by increasing air velocity and/or increasing turbulence cannot, by itself, explain the corresponding increase in draught sensations. The difference between heat loss from different parts of the head was smaller than the one found in earlier investigations. A good correlation between convective heat transfer coefficient of the overall head and draught sensation, for percentage of dissatisfied DR lower than 25% was found.

At temperatures above comfort, sweating is increasingly important for human thermoregulation and air humidity becomes important when evaluating heat stress. Among heat acclimatized people, sweating is often quite efficient. Dry supply air may be a promising low-cost alternative to cooling in hot and humid areas. 123 heat-adapted subjects participated in six one-hour exposures in cubicles in a warm room without air conditioning. Each subject had individually-adjustable air outlets both above and below the desk. The temperature and humidity of the supply;air was varied in a blinded and randomized design. One exposure had no air supply. At the end of e#ach exposure the perceptions of subjects, water intake, skin temperatures, sweating and a simple performance measure were registered. The supply of de-humidified but not cooled air significantly increased acceptability and reduced most of the monitored indictors of heat stress. This reduction is possible even in offices without airtight enclosures when the dried air is supplied directly to each workplace.

In industrial buildings, the Edified Environmental Quality is very important, especially in Brazil, due to its warm and humid climate. Our subject is an industrial prefabricated building with a low internal heat generation and our objectives are: a) reduction in heat solar gains; b) save electric energy using natural light; c) intensive, well distributed and assured natural ventilation. We studied natural ventilation in laboratory experiments with a small-scale industrial building. The results show that it is possible to get good ventilation rates, that, associated with the other qualities, give industrial buildings Edified Environmental Quality and Energy Conservation.

A newly constructed and commissioned Research and Demonstration Facility allows for an evaluation of the as-built performances of a vertical displacement ventilation system and a conventional variable air volume system in two architecturally similar rooms with each served by its own independent HVAC system. Evaluations based on air temperature, velocity, and contaminant concentration measurements obtained at several location and heights in the two rooms and within the HVAC systems were performed at two thermal load conditions. As-built performance deficiencies suggest the need for a re-evaluation of commissioning criteria. Baseline thermal and air quality performance of the VDV system was superior to that of the VAV system. The data were also used to validate a unique two-zone model of displacement ventilation.

Four turbulence models, the "standard" k-e model, a modified k-e model, a RNG k-e model, and a Reynolds-stress model, were used to study a turbulent buoyant plume and room airflow with displacement ventilation. For the plume flow, it is found that the Reynolds-stress model predicted satisfactory velocity, temperature and turbulence quantities while the performance of the eddy-viscosity model is poor. For the room airflow, the computed airflow patterns, mean velocities, temperatures and contaminant concentrations agree reasonably with the experimental data obtained from a full-scale test chamber, but the discrepancies in some locations are large.

In addition to detailed measurements of temperature, air velocity, and tracer gas concentration, a skin-temperature-controlled thermal manikin was used to evaluate the quality of the non-uniform thermal environments produced by the proposed system in comparison to a conventional ceiling-based system. The results show that the proposed system could be operated to maintain acceptable thermal comfort and high ventilation efficiency in the occupied zone of the space, while at the same time taking advantage of the temperature stratification to achieve energy savings in air-conditioning of the space.

The outdoor thermal environment can affect displacement ventilation in tow related aspects, namely the additional vertical wall buoyancy flows generated and the additional cooling load generated. These effects are due to the altered interior wall surface temperature and heat flux. This paper used a computational fluid dynamics approach to examine the flow and temperature fields of a displacement ventilated room influenced by outdoor temperature and solar radiation. It is shown that the warmer floor and ceiling weaken the gravity currents and the ceiling-jet driven wall flows respectively.

The application of the model clarifies some relationships regarding the air flow and the heat. The model is also used to predict the temperature profiles, reproducing the measured profiles well, and show that accurate heat load profiles are important for accurate prediction of temperature profiles.

In a displacement ventilated room the non-uniform contaminant distribution causes and improved indoor air quality in the occupied zone compared with conventional mixing ventilation. This has been demonstrated in numerous studies by chemical measurements. In this study the air quality in a displacement ventilated room was determined directly by asking humans about how they perceived the air quality. A trained sensory panel comprising 12 subjects assessed the perceived air quality immediately after entering a climate chamber. The experiments showed that the perceived air quality in the displacement ventilated chamber was substantially better than in the case of mixing ventilation.

A reliable prediction of heat transfer is very important in the analysis of displacement ventilation, not only to assess the system cooling load, but also to ensure that the system utilizes the thermal fluid flow principles to achieve the required vertical air displacement. Four different methods are used to extract the heat transfer data from the output of a computational fluid dynamics analysis. The total heat gain into the room from the outdoor environment can be more than 50% of the total cooling load. It is shown that the outdoor environment also affect their spatial distribution of the heat gain.

Although the principles of displacement ventilation are well-know, it appears that a correct use needs better knowledge for a good control of the flow pattern inside the room. Both experiments and calculations were carried out to investigate convective phenomena in such systems. The numerical study were performed using the CFD finite element code N3S and the CFD finite volume code ESTET. Different situations were investigated showing the influence of the main parameters such as, the heat release rate, the supply unit flow rate, the influence of cold walls on the flow pattern and temperature profile.

Non-use of residential mechanical ventilation equipment is due in part to the lack of user-friendly ventilation control systems. A prototype residential ventilation controller was developed and field-tested to determine its acceptability to home-owners. The prototype controller incorporated an adjustable duty cycle to control ventilation rate, programmable time-of-day scheduling, countdown timer override/purge to adjust CO" level, manual override with adjustable ventilation rate, and maximum-limit CO2-based override. Controllers were installed at 16 field test sites and data on CO2 concentration and ventilation fan use were taken over a four-month period. Home-owners reported a significant improvement indoor air quality and judged the prototype controller easy to use. Data analysis showed the average CO2 concentration was reduced by 7%.

The performance of a passive ventilation system using beam space as a fresh air supply chamber was investigated by use of a test house and computer simulations. In a test house of which equivalent leakage area is 2.0 (cm squared/m squared), the fresh-sir was not supplied to the first floor from the beam space. But the outside-air infiltrated to the first floor through the leaks and its volume fluctuated due to the wind. In a well-airtight house: 0.5 (cm squared/m squared), the fresh-air was supplied to every room and its volume was steady. Its indoor air quality was acceptable in winter in Sapporo, Japan.

Study of pressure and flow loss caused by heat-pipes for heat recovery was carried out using computational fluid dynamics. It has been shown that heat-pipes located in the bottom of the stack produce greater insertion flow loss (IFL) than those located at the top. In addition, heat-pipes located next to the stack walls give rise to less IFL than those places in the centre. The results also showed that a smaller insertion pressure (IPL) caused by a heat-pipe corresponds to a greater IFL and vice versa. It has been demonstrated that IFL is the preferred indicator for loss caused by obstacles submerged in stack flows. The temperature of the heat pipe has little effect on flow loss performance of the heat exchangers.

The temperature gradient in a displacement ventilation room has fascinated many workers in this field. A imitative office room was selected for this study. The room was ventilated by means of a low velocity diffuser standing on the floor and attached to the rear wall. The exhaust outlet is on the ceiling. Room temperature at several heights were recorded with 23 thermocouples. The relationship between the working area air temperature difference and the supply air temperature difference have been obtained. The relationship can become a reference on design of displacement ventilation system.

This paper aims to clarify the thermal performance in the rooms with displacement ventilation. Results of experiments performed on a 2.8m x 2.6m x3m test room with high heat loads (30-170W/m squared) are presented. Results of heat exchange analysis inside the room are also presented. The results of experiments indicate that the temperature stratification is strongly dependent on the air flow rate and heater height at a given heater input. Floor surface absorbs the heat from other surfaces by radiation and a great fraction of the heat is transferred from the floor surface to the floor structure. Results indicate the importance of floor insulation especially in this system.

The aim of this research is to see if the displacement ventilation principle can protect a person from the exposure to passive tobacco smoking. This is done by full-scale experiments with two breathing thermal manikins, smoke visualizations, and tracer gas measurements. In some situations, exhaled smoke will stratify in a certain height due to the vertical temperature gradient. This horizontal layer of exhaled tobacco smoke may lead to exposure. In other situations, the smoke is mixed into the upper zone, and the passive smoker is protected to some extent by the displacement principle and the convective boundary layer flow around the body.

It is the aim of this study to develop a mathematical model, describing indoor air pollutant concentrations as a function of indoor and outdoor sources. The work was carried out in two directions: development of a multi-zone air flow mode, and a transport model defining the pollutant concentrations in each zone of a building as a function of time. Data for simulation experiments were obtained from a typical Israeli apartments, constant outdoor concentrations, and assumed emission factors. It was found that indoor air quality is affected by meteorological conditions (wind), emissions from indoor sources, and the air tightness of a given building. The configuration of the staircase (open or closed and the presence of the vent top) also affects indoor air concentrations.

Air quality control in ventilation and air-cleaning systems is provided  by ventilation itself, air purification and reduction of atmospheric  emissions. Ventilation in industrial premised may provide for air re-circulation  use of laminar airflows, design of ventilation modules, zonal planning  of workrooms, separate local systems of heating and ventilation, control  automatization and increasing ventilation and air purification expenses  in capital investments. Air purification systems being a part of ventilation systems should be  based on the following principles: contaminant volume and amount  decrease design and use of air purification systems correlating with the  source of contaminant emissions, minimizing systems resistance. Environmental safety in ventilation and air purification system  accidents, which includes preventative measures, measures for  elimination of hazardous effects, safety standard is a matter of the  greatest concern at the present time. Air quality control at present time should provide effective and  economical ventilation which meets the requirements on environmental  safety.

Using data from a large number of teacher questionnaires distributed to  public elementary schools in Kawasaki, Japan, we determined factors  having the strongest influence on their sensory evaluations of thermal  and cross-ventilation condition in natural-ventilated  temperature-climate classrooms. These influential factors were derived  from various factors regarding thermal-related environmental control  used by teachers and classroom architectural planning factors. Then,  using data from student questionnaires, we determined seating-dependent  distributions of similar sensory evaluation for groups of classes with  respective category of influential factors. AS the result, windows and  door were fully opened except being closed for the safety and noise  control reasons. The class directional orientation and the window types  related to architectural openings had the strongest influence on sensory  evaluations. The classrooms facing southward and having window types  tend to be fully opened provided the most comfortable thermal  environment.

The air exchange rate (or air changes per hour:ACH) was measured under 4  different conditions in 3 stationary cars. The ACH ranged between 1.0  and 3.0-h1 with windows closed and no mechanical ventilation, between  1.8 and 3.7-h1 with windows closed and fan set on recirculation, between  13.3 and 26.1-h1 with windows open and no mechanical ventilation, and  between 36.2 and 47.5-h1 with windows closed with the fan set on fresh  air. ACH with windows closed and no ventilation was higher for the  older car than for the newer cars. With the windows closed and the fan  turned off, ACH was not influenced by wind speed. ACH in parked cars is  relevant to understanding exposures to pollutants from internal sources  was estimated using the EPA model for simulated "stop-and-go" urban  driving cycles, and it was found that the pollutants build up rapidly  and are diluted slowly inside parked cars.

Energy conservation is not always an inconsistent idea with the indoor  air quality HVAC designers should keep in mind that the harmony of these  two concepts depend on their design philosophy as well as on their  practical evaluation measures. The thermal zoning HVAC should be   necessarily followed by the ventilation zoning. Several advanced  techniques, such as the task-and-ambient system, transient  characteristics of the room environment and human body and dynamic  simulation, should be applied to obtain a better individual thermal  satisfaction with even better indoor air quality.

Formaldehyde concentrations and air exchange rates were measured in 53  rooms of 27 prefabricated houses. The concentrations of formaldehyde  were determined with a photometric method, whereas ventilation rates  were measured with a tracer-gas technique. In 40% of the cases indoor  formaldehyde concentrations exceeded the guideline value of 0.12 mg/m  cube (median 0.111 mg/m cubed)> Critical formaldehyde concentrations  were found in older prefabricated houses (erected before 1985) with  chipboard walls, with the boards facing the interior of the rooms and in  rooms with old furniture. Material tests identified chipboard as the  major emission source of formaldehyde in these buildings. In most  objects measured air exchange rates (median=0.20h -1) indicated very  poor ventilation, which was another reason for high concentrations of  formaldehyde.

A trial was set up to determine the effectiveness of mechanical  ventilation with heat recovery (MVHR) in reducing humidity and the  effect this has on house dust mite populations in homes occupied by  asthmatic patients. The trial included monitoring of a range of factors  that might change with the introduction of MVHR and we have an effect on  clinical measures of asthma. One such factor was the level of NO2,  which was measured in the kitchen, bedroom, living room and outside at  40 homes, before and after MVHR was installed in 20 of these homes. The  introduction of MVHR had no significant effect on NO(2) in any room or  season even when homes with and without gas cooking were treated  separately.

Several tests of carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations in both adult's and  children's bedrooms have shown high levels in a fraction of the houses.  This indicates a very low effective ventilation rate per person and the  possibility that the concentration of other contaminants in the air in  those rooms will also be high, at reasonable source strengths of the  pollutants. Since bedrooms are designed for sleep, during which the  resting body makes repairs to many systems, this does not bode will for  the general health of those sleeping in such rooms. More research into  the concentration of other contaminants in high CO2 houses is warranted.  At the levels of CO2 found in some rooms, there may even be some direct  effects of CO2, a possibility being studied by Hydro Quebec and Health  Canada.

Traditionally we used to design air conditioning systems to provide  constant comfort air conditions (temperature, humidity and velocity) in  an occupied zone. Is that really what we, inhabitants of air  conditioned spaces are looking for? Observations of hygienists show  that a man has a better productivity, working at lower surrounding room  temperature, until he feels discomfort of being chilled or we would  prefer higher indoor temperature before lunch than after it. Should we  consider these observations as a message that we would rather provide  variable than steady indoor climate? We succeeded in separating a man  from outdoor conditions, placing him into the shelters of modern  buildings. There is no doubt that we would like to be isolated from   outdoor pollutants, traffic noise and other unpleasant irritants, but  why to be separated from a fresh breeze of air with velocity sometimes  exceeding the comfort level of say 0.15 m/s, or warmth of a swift  sunlight. The subject of this paper is not to report an achievement but  rather to initiate a dispute on the current approach in consideration of  comfort conditions for indoor climate and discuss a new trend in air  conditioning system design. DYNAMIC or INTELLIGENT ventilations is a system, where temperature,  velocity, humidity of air, its ion and possibly odor composition,  lighting in the room and probably sound effects are controlled by a  program according to the inhabitants wishes or hygienists  recommendations, the main features and basic components of the system  are presented. It may be a system of the nearest future and we,  engineers, do not see any technical obstacles to put it into practice.

A new bullet train car with an effective ventilation system has been  constructed as a result of co-operation between Japan Tobacco In. and  East Japan Railway Company. The purpose of this system is to provide  satisfactory and good quality air both to smokers and non-smokers on  board. The principal aim of the system is to control the air stream in  the carriage so as to prevent the tobacco smoke in the smoking section  from moving into the non-smoking section. Moreover, an electrostatic  precipitator and a deodorant filter were installed. The efficiency of  this system was examined using this new train car.

The present study aims to assess the between and within workstations  variability of the indoor air conditions in a sealed building with  mechanical ventilation. The building under study had 9 constant air  HVAC systems with 30 units of distribution and an outdoor air intake of  a least 15 L/S/P for each system. CO2, temperature, humidity, and air  velocity were measured 4 times/day in 120 workstations and were repeated  during 3 days in 23 workstations. Total VOC, formaldehyde and total  airborne particulates were measured in 14 workstations. Variability  between workstations during work hours was for CO2: 571 ppm +- 69, for  temperature: 23.2 degrees C +- 0.5, for humidity: 30% +_ 4, and for air  velocity: .04m/sec. +- .03 (neck) and .03 m/sec. +_ .03 (ankles).  Variability within workstations over 3 days was also low despite some  outdoor variations. Total VOC were less than 200g/m cube, formaldehyde  less than 2m/g cube and total airborne particulates less than 25g/m  cube except for 3 workstations and outside. Properly designed building  with mechanical ventilation and air conditioning can be effective in  maintaining relatively stable indoor air conditions between and within  workstations.

In the ship repair industry, enormous amounts of repair work is done in  very large crude carriers (VLCC), such as in the cargo and ballast  tanks. During the repair process, large quantities of smoke, fumes and  heat are generated in these confined spaces. Due to the great depth and  size of the tanks and limited number of openings on the deck, it is very  difficult to extract these toxic gases. A new ventilation system based on the "all-directional, global  ventilation using the push-pull and displacement method" was designed.  The design concept is based on transferring fresh air to the bottom of  the compartments and blowing it out uniformly from an air distributor in  a "vector flow". Suction tubes installed at the top of the compartment  would bring out heat and dust. It was shown by computer simulation and  experimentation that the air flow pattern was reasonable and efficient.  The new ventilation system can be used not only in the repair processes  of VLCC but also in similar enclosed spaces such as big workshops and  warehouses.

The strategy most frequently used by building engineers to maintain an  acceptable indoor air quality in office buildings and solve indoor air  quality related complaints in ventilation. It is generally assumed that  the indoor air quality requirements would be automatically met if  adequate ventilation were provided. Ventilation is particularly effective under two situations: to  re-establish the indoor air quality level after a scheduled shut down of  the HVAC system and to speed up the removal of the contaminants  generated in areas where renovations are taking place. In North  America, it is a common practice to shut down the HVAC system in the  evenings of week days and during weekends to save energy. It is also  common to have renovations take place in part of an occupied building.  Under either situation, special measures have to be used to remove the  contaminant build-up as a direct result of such activities. To use this strategy effectively and in an energy efficient manner, it  is not adequate to simply increase the ventilation rate. The building  engineers have to know when, how much and how long the ventilation rate  would need to be increased. Discussions with building engineers suggest  that they do not have such information. This paper provides some  practical guidelines for the building engineers to effectively operate  the HVAC system after a scheduled shut-down or during a renovation  period to avoid indoor air quality problems. These guidelines have been  developed from the results of computer simulations of the contaminant  movement in buildings and from experience in managing buildings.

The impact of outdoor air change rates on the indoor air pollutant  levels was evaluated in office buildings located in metropolitan areas  of Seoul, Korea. Five buildings were selected for measurements. The  concentration levels of the indoor air pollutants were monitored at  different outdoor air change rates and the odor and discomfort ratings  were surveyed with questionnaire by the occupants. The correlation  between ventilation rate and indoor air pollutant levels were evaluated  in various operating conditions of HVAC system. The results of this study could indicate that the air change rates and  the carbon dioxide concentrations were statically significant in office  buildings, and the proper outdoor air change rates and the operational  strategy of ventilation systems should be considered differently with  symptoms of occupants in office building.

Alternate  designs for smoke control and the thermal sensitivity of the sprinkler  heads were evaluated. Performance of the ventilation system in this car  park was assessed by studying the thermal environment at the occupied  zone using Computational Fluid Dynamics. The air speed predicted were  used to calculate the mean age of the air and the percentage of  dissatisfied. From the investigation, designs on the fire protection  and ventilation systems are recommended for providing a healthy and safe  environment in this car park.

Knowledge of tobacco smoke exposures in indoor environment plays an  important role. We are looking for a possibility to estimate and  compare objective smoking quantities by analysis of sedimented indoor  particles by nicotine as a target compound. The results show a good  conformity with the real tobacco consume in the examined flats.  Limitations of this method are in the possible use of nicotine as  pesticide and in the possible residues from earlier tobacco consume. A  sufficient classification can be made, if none, less or frequently  tobacco will be smoked inside the house. The average concentration of  nicotine in non-smoker houses is 3 ug/g indoor dust (+- 2 ug/g). One  cigarette smoked daily increases the concentration by 5 ug/g (+- 2ug/g).

Kitchen-area 22-hour gravimetric PM2.5 and diffusion staintube CO  concentrations were measured in homes with open-fire and improved wood  cookstoves in two studies, one in three test houses an one in 15  open-fire and 25 improved-stove houses. CO personal samples were also  taken for mother and child. Correlations between kitchen-area and CO  and PM2.5 levels were high (r2+0.89-0.94), as were those between the  personal samples for mother and child (r2+0.95-0.99). In general, the  correlations were lower for less-polluted conditions. The C)/PM2.5  ratio averaged 12.3-144.4 and 13.1-16.2 for open fires and improved  stoves. These results generally support the use of CO staintubes as a  proxy for PM2.5

Field measurement has been conducted to study the PM-10 level at several office entrance areas inside the Hong Kong Polytechnic University which  is located close to automobile pollution sources. One building was  selected for detailed investigation. Both indoor and outdoor dust  levels were measured at the entrance. A simple expression has been used  to indicate the influence of human movement and wind speed on the indoor  and outdoor PM-10 ratio. It has been found that high wind speed  corresponds to almost identical indoor and outdoor dust concentrations.  The higher indoor population density results in higher indoor to outdoor  PM-10 ratio.

A method to calculate coefficients of wind pressure and drag of a 2-dimension plate and disc is described with the calculation of the drag coefficients of a cylinder and sphere by making use of the potential theory, and furthermore a calculation method of a drag coefficient of a rectangular prism is shown together with offering 2 types of calculation methods of the pressure in the back side of the wind. These are, so to speak, a method to do calculation from a boundary pressure mean value of the main stream and the stagnation zone and a method to introduce the part after the backside stagnation zone maximum height from main stream pressure loos calculation. Furthermore, as a practical calculation method, description is made with a contraction coefficient method, calculation method of the wake maximum height, and calculation of the wake internal pressure by means of velocity profile.

The friction coefficient is greatly changed in accordance with Re number in gap wind capacity calculation, but the local pressure loss coefficient is sufficient with a constant. With draft, Re number is in general great and aperture thickness is small. Therefore the influence of the friction around the aperture is small, and the local pressure loss is finely changed in accordance with the aspect of the flow. Thus the calculation concerning such change is important. A wind capacity calculation expression is described by separating it into the ones of driving pressure and flow rate determination.

For the prevention of suface condensation in a multi-room residential house, natural ventilation between rooms is one of the most influential factors. In this paper a method d#for analyzing stochastic properties of indoor air temperature and humidity is presented under the condition of natural ventilation caused by temperature differences or buoyant forces. The present method gives precise results for many apple;applications and can be used to analyze the indoor climate. Simple example calculations show that the stochastic nature of external climate and thermal natural ventilation has significant influence on indoor climate and thus on the occurrence of surface condensation.

In this paper, we propose an Air Quality Index (AQI) useful for evaluating ventilation systems and which take into account the energy consumption. Our index, computed every hour, considers 4 pollutants: Co2, CO, NO2, HCHO. Several ventilation strategies have been built, installed into a typical French house occupied by 2 adults and 2 children, and simulated using CLIM2000 (software for energy management). We present here our results on the air quality and the energy consumption for 2 reference cases (smoker, no smoker) and three ventilation strategies.

To reduce energy consumption in buildings, measures such as the use of cavity walls, double glazed sealed windows and insulated lofts are employed in new houses to improve thermal insulation. The energy consumption and thermal performance of two different types of house, an old and a new detached house are compared. The rate of air in flow as determined by tracer gas, the air velocity and temperature distribution at two levels of 0.15m and 1.2m were measured. The results show that in the new house the temperature difference between a seated person's head and ankle is more than 3 degrees C. This difference is increased when the central heating is switched on. In both houses there is a large amount of air infiltration into the lounge. Despite the inadequacy of installed air ventilator, the energy efficiency of the new house is demonstrated

This paper consists of a theoretical study of particle deposition in a duct system, and field measurements in five HVAC systems. Particle deposition occurs mainly in components such as heater, bends and dampers. Deposition in the duct is reduced by good air filters. The field measurements confirmed the theoretical model. The greatest collection of particles was found in the intake duct. The particles comprise a relatively high proportion of viable fungi. However, it has not been possible to detect any net particle contribution to the supply air from the ventilation system.

The performance of a ventilating air-conditioning system is a well-insulated and well-air tightened house was investigated. The system used the beam space on the ceiling of the first floor as a fresh air supply chamber. The volume of fresh air supplied to each room, the temperature and the heat load of each room were measured in a test house of which the equivalent leakage area per floor area is 2.0[cm squared/m squared]. The measurement show that the thermal indoor climate is acceptable in September in HOKKAIDO, but the air flow was not well controlled because of the leak on the first floor. Therefore, the influence of the leaks was investigated by use of the computer simulation by method. As the result, the air flow is well controlled in a better airtight house (0.5[cm squared/m squared]).

The design of a building with a passive stack ventilation system must be based on total integration of all disciplines in the design process. In order to be able to control the air flows in the system, the building should be designed and built according to the present requirements for the air tightness of the building envelope. The ventilation system should be dimensioned based on the mean outdoor temperature and mean wind velocity during the warmest month of the year to maintain adequate ventilation during the summer. In order to avoid over-ventilation during the heating season, the dimensioning calculations should be repeated for the mean temperature and mean wind velocity during the coldest month of the year. The design must show how too high air flows are avoided during the winter. Calculations for typical Scandinavian buildings show that the opening area of the air inlets should be ca.2.7 cm squared/m squared of floor area in order to maintain adequate (o.5 ACH) ventilation rate in the whole house or apartment for at least 75% of the year (reference whether data for Stockholm in the year 1971). The variation in the ventilation rate in individual rooms can be much higher that the variation of the ventilation rate of the whole building. For example, a room in the upper flow of a 1 and a half floor house can have inadequate outdoor air flow throughout the heating season.

The use of continuous mechanical ventilation with heat recovery (MVHR) in dwellings is expected to reduce the population of house dust mites. Twenty houses in the Southampton area were fitted with MVHR systems with a further 20 acting as controls. Temperatures and humidities were measured in asthmatic patients' bedrooms for over one year. During the winter four months the MV bedrooms had a mean absolute humidity of 6.75 as against 7.5g/kg for the controls (P<0.001). The WHO has suggested 7g/kg as a figure below which mites fail to thrive: 15 out of 20 of the MV houses had a winter humidity below 7g/kg, compared with 3 of the control houses. House leakiness affected the humidities in the MV group but not the controls. Mite and allergen results will be presented when available.

The issues of exposure to airborne pollutants and the health hazard associated with air quality are well recognized. Increasing attention is given to fine particulate contaminants in the submicron size range. Exposure to indoor pollutants could thus be significant as people spend up to 90% of their time indoors. There is so far no clear understanding of the indoor-outdoor air relationship in terms of airborne particulates, sources of pollutant particles and their significance as related to the exposure and health risk. This paper presents results of a case study in an office building focusing on the relationship between outdoor-indoor air and investigating the effect of filtration and ventilation on indoor airborne particle characteristics.

The HVAC industry is searching for cost-effective and efficient solutions for meeting requirements that greatly increase the amount of outside ventilation air needed in buildings. The Electric Power Research Institute has teamed with equipment manufacturers to develop two dual path HVAC systems, with one path dedicated to preconditioning the outside air. Both deep-cool and deep-dry the incoming air before mixing it with the return air, reducing or eliminating the latent load on the primary cooling coil. In addition, their energy efficiency cuts electric energy consumption and demand, providing significant operating savings.

This paper concerns a new questionnaire, the Home Environment Survey (HES) and in particular the questions included in it about sick building syndrome symptoms. The data were derived from a study of 132 refurbished homes in the North of England and a comparable sample from 140 un-refurbished homes. The response to the symptom questions did not discriminate between the two housing groups. In contrast, a better-established instrument, the SF-36. did show poorer health in the unimproved housing. An initial attempt to improve the resolution of the HES symptom questions did not result in a significant difference between housing groups, bit did result in the HES correlating more strongly with the SF-36 scales, which may reduce the benefits of complementarity.

In some situations, measurement of indoor CO2 concentrations can be used to assess indoor air quality and ventilation. However, oversimplified descriptions of measurement procedures based on CO2 have been presented, and there have been many cases where indoor CO2 concentrations have been misinterpreted. This paper describes the relationship of indoor CO2 concentrations to building air quality and ventilation, with a focus on how CO2 can be used to evaluate air quality and ventilation performance. While CO2 concentrations do not provide a comprehensive indication of indoor air quality, they can be used to assess the acceptability of a space in terms of human body odor. Also, under some circumstances CO2 can be used to evaluate building ventilation, specifically air change rates and percent outdoor air intake.

Natural ventilation is important to indoor air quality because its rate is usually low and cannot be easily adjusted. The results of a numerical study on the airflow within a single-sided naturally ventilated room with a large opening is presented here. Lam-Bremhorst low-Reynolds-number k-e model together with a self-developed two-dimensional flow simulation code based on SIMPLE algorithm was used. External temperatures in equatorial climate similar to those of Singapore were selected. Two room set-ups were examined. The firs is with a heat source and the second a split unit air-conditioner. Air exchange rates were predicted. It is found that the presence of the circulation fan in the split unit air-conditioner will decrease vertical temperature gradient in the opening region and hence the ventilation rate is lowered.

The characteristics of airflow patterns and the distributions of local mean age are investigated by means of an experiment with a large cubic enclosure. The two dimensional zone model are tried to construct adopting two dimensional free jet theory so that the two dimensional zonal model is capable to estimate the age distribution approximately and evaluate the air change efficiency precisely.

The calculation results were in good agreement with the experiment in case the chamber height was 100mm even when chamber geometries and air outlet positions were varied. However, in case chamber height was 70mm, it was necessary to adjust friction coefficient immediately after the air supply outlet.

Recently, airtight homes have become popular in Japan. They have also become subjects of discussion concerning indoor air pollutions such as carbon dioxide (CO2), formaldehyde (HCHO), and volatile organic compounds (VOC). We used a simple method of measuring HCHO using a passive gas tube and the acetyle acetone methom (AAM), checking HCHO every hour for 24 hours and simultaneously checking C)2 concentrations. The level of HCHO concentration in airtight homes decreased every year. We found HCHO levels at more than 0.5ppm in new airtight homes at night it was especially high because doors and windows were kept closed. The air change rate was below 0.1 times per hour. Many types of pollutants were emitted from sources such as plywood, furniture and paint on interior walls. The levels of HCHO in airtight homes attenuated below 0.1ppm after a few years.

Air quality in a room is measured by the concentration of pollutants presented there and by the efficiency of ventilation. Besides, in the winter, we need to account for the effect of thermal comfort associated with the indoor air. This paper used a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) scheme to evaluated the local concentration and temperature profiles in a bedroom with window and transom positioned at various locations to determine the impact of these openings on the thermal comfort and air quality of the indoor air. The results obtained shows that thermal buoyancy resulting from the thermal plumes generated by the heat sources in space provides the mechanism for improving the air quality indoor. In addition, two optimum design combinations of window-transom arrangements are proposed for attaining an improved condition for air quality and acceptable thermal comfort in the winter.

Most of the people responsible for buildings and their interior design and management, probably agree that indoor plants and interior plantscaping contribute to environmental quality. There has been relatively little scientific research however, on the ability of indoor plants to reduce indoor air pollution. It had been proposed that plants may function as "green livers" and act as sinks for many trace contaminants, through the metabolism of such chemicals. This proposal is analogous to the concept of plants as the "green lungs" of the earth due to the production of oxygen through photosynthesis. During the course of evolution, the higher plants have developed an effective defense system to protect labile macromolecules against attack by scavenging free radicals and hydrogen peroxide, which are formed as a result of oxidative stresses such as extremes of temperature or air pollution. The responses of indoor plants to pollutants may provide a simple method of monitoring gaseous pollutants, as well as providing pollution abatement to improve the quality of the air for building occupants. Indoor plants have also been shown to have a positive effect on relative humidity in an office environment. In recent years, researchers from several disciplines including plant physiology, plant biochemistry, environmental psychology, clinical psychology and behavioural medicine have been investigating the benefits of contact with plants. A recent study at the University of Technology, Sydney, demonstrated enhanced alpha EEG (Occipital Electroencephalograph), in the presence of plants. The plant significantly enhanced alpha waves (9-12Hz) in the right hemisphere. No significant differences were seen in the left hemisphere.

A Breathing Wall used as the main component in a natural ventilation system were experimentally evaluated by determining wind velocity effects on the air flowrate, heat recovery capability, and internal condensation prevention. Test conditions simulated typical winter climate in Tokyo, Japan. At the most frequent velocity 3m/s and an outdoor air temperature of 5 degrees C, the system provides sufficient ventilation corresponding to 0.26 ACH if employed in a residential house; and at the maximum wind velocity of 10m/s, the most indoor perforated aluminum-foil sheet reached 11.2 degrees C due to good heat recovery capability, with no occurrence of internal condensation.

Numerical simulations are carried out to evaluate the employment of a newly proposed natural ventilation system which uses a pitched roof made of Breathing Walls. The system was developed to provide sufficient ventilation for obtaining a healthy/comfortable indoor independent of other architectural elements of a house, i.e, side walls, floor members, etc. Simulation results based on typical weather climate in Tokyo, Japan showed that a pitched roof of 6-cm-thick Breathing Walls containing 11 perforated aluminum foil sheets provide 0.5 air changes per hour, and that the equivalent thermal transmittance is 0.34 and 0.38 W/m squared degrees C providing that no internal condensation occurs at the maximum wind speed of 10 m/s.

The indoor air quality issue in Taiwan has received more and more attention due to degradation of the outdoor environment. Carbon monoxide (CO) and particulate matter 10 (PM) were two major pollutants, showed the high Pollutant Standards Index (PSI) level reading from public monitoring station in Taiwan. The concentration of carbon dioxide CO2), as taken in ASHRAE Standard 62-1989, is termed as an index for indoor air pollution. This study intends to identify the impacts from both of outdoor air and living behaviour patterns on indoor air quality by field measurement and questionnaire survey.

This paper describes results from comprehensive measurements of airflow characteristics in two real-scale test rooms at 44 combinations of ventilation system, air supply device, airflow rate and supply and return air temperature difference. Real field situations were simulated in the test rooms furnished, arranged and equipped as a real office. During the measurements occupants performed typical office work. A three-dimensional laser Doppler anemometer was used during the measurements. Mean air velocities up to 0.6m/s and turbulence intensities up to 70% were measured. The frequency of the velocity fluctuations that contribute up to 90% to the standard deviation of the velocity was less than 2 Hz. large changes in the direction of the instantaneous velocity vector were identified. The airflow near the walls and the floor was found to be close to two-dimensional. In the rest of the occupied zone the airflow was three-dimensional.

The research concerns air exchange through four building elements: window, frame joints, window sill clamp and wall connections. As the result of research there have been obtained curves which determine the amount of air exchange and the character of that process. The obtained results will help to analyze the model simulating air exchange through building structures and they will also be used in research of the so called "intelligent" partitions.

Air leakage rates were measured by blower door depressurization in 43 homes in Southern California during the 1995 summer season. air change rates were also calculated from indoor/outdoor ozone measurements. The average air leakage rate of 43 homes was 0.63+- 0.33 hr. A subset of 14 homes was measured by perfluoro-metyl-cyclohexane tracer gas (PFT) for weekly air change rates. For these 14 homes, the average air change rate using the PFT method was 1.36-1.21 hr and the average air leakage rate was 0.74 - 0.4 hr. The median air change rate calculated from indoor/outdoor ozone measurements was 1.68 hr -1. Air change rates and air leakage rates were not significantly correlated. The fan pressurization test determines the relative leakage area of a structure, while the PFT method measures average concentration of tracer gas over time. The PFT method integrates different ventilation conditions over time, while the blower door tests leakage in homes with doors, windows and vents closed. Air change rates calculated from indoor/outdoor ozone measurements were comparable to those measured by the pFt method, but did not correlate well with air leakage rate measurements. Therefore, air change rates may be more applicable for indoor air quality investigation than air leakage rates.

The applicability of the 3-dimensional ultrasonic anemometer for measurement of turbulent room air flows was studied and the results were compared with the omnidirectional sensor. The ultrasonic anemometer is suitable for both field and laboratory and the measured vectorial velocity is directly comparable with fluid dynamics simulations. In a turbulent flow both the mean air speed and turbulence intensity measured with an omnidirectional sensor differ significantly from the corresponding vectorial results. Omnidirectional results, which are commonly used for thermal comfort assessment, can be calculated from the output of the ultrasonic anemometer.

In this paper a new strategy for controlling ventilation systems is described. The strategy provides fresh air at a flow rate proportional to an estimate of the rate at which occupants generate carbon dioxide. Thus, the ventilation rate is nearly proportional to the occupant density even under transient conditions. Properties of the new strategy are described, and the performance is compared to a concentration regulating strategy ion a simulation. The new strategy is shown to respond faster to a change in the occupant density and to keep the concentration at or below a threshold.

The air circulation wall is a triple envelope and double air layer system of outside walls and roofs. Its midst envelope is a thermal insulation board and divides the wall into tow air layers. Since its outer air layer works like a solar collector, this system increases indoor air temperature in winter under closed air circulation. In summer, its open air circulation exhausts hot air to the outdoor. many Japanese wooden houses with this air circulation system have been constructed. however, many problems are remained for its optimum designing such as the precise prediction of thermal characteristics in the layers, etc. This paper investigates the air distribution and thermal performance of the air circulation system through real-size model experiments.

A reaction between styrene and ozone was studied in simulated ventilation equipment. The gases were generated continuously and passed through a 6.0m PTFE tube for 23 seconds. Sampling was performed at the end of the tube with Tenax TA and a s Sep-Pak DNPH-Silica cartridge. It was found that a reaction between styrene and ozone occurred in the PTFE tube with formaldehyde and benzaldehyde as the main reaction products. Twenty-three seconds is a reasonable time for outdoor air to pass through the duct to the supply air terminal device in a building, thus showing that the same reaction between VOCs and ozone in the supply air is possible.

It is shown that conventional methods of evaluating air-change effectiveness from age-of-air calculations are affected by recirculation. The result is that when air is recirculated, the conventional air-change effectiveness measure cannot be used to make judgments about the air distribution pattern in zones without knowledge of the recirculation fraction. To overcome this problem, a ventilation performance measure called the relative air-change effectiveness is defined. It is shown that the relative air-change effectiveness is independent of the recirculation fraction and that it may be determined solely for age-of-air calculations. The data from a previously published experiment on a mechanically ventilated building is re-evaluated using the relative air-change effectiveness.

In air-conditioned (AC) rooms, complaints of unacceptable indoor air quality (IAQ) are increasing. One of the main reasons is that the fresh air supply becomes polluted when passed through an air conditioning system. Occupants need the characteristic odor of fresh air. A research project has been conducted over the past 3 years, in which fresh air is provided directly to AC rooms with a fresh air unit. The effect of fresh air upon the distribution of indoor air temperature and velocity could be minimized by different outlets, velocities, angles and mixture of methods of fresh air. The practical data for using the fresh air unit are suggested.

The main purpose of the research was to characterize the sensory and chemical emission rates of ventilation ducts in different environmental conditions. Ducts with different levels of contamination were studied under different temperature, relative humidity and air velocity. The temperature and relative humidity values were on the range of that normally used in a ductwork system. The air velocity changed between 0.1 m/s and 1.5 m/s. The following three ducts were tested: two new ducts, of which the first one was cleaned with normally used solvent and the second one was not cleaned after leaving from the production line, and the third one, which was a twenty year old dirty supply air duct from an office building. A trained panel assessed the decipol levels of the flow rate before and after the ducts. Volatile organic compounds were also determined before and after the ducts. The results showed that the air flow rate had statistically significant effect on the source strength of the ducts measured in olfs. The source strength of the new uncleaned and old dirty ducts increased with increasing air flow rate. The effect on the source strength of the new cleaned duct was opposite. The temperature and relative humidity of the air did not have statistically significant effect on the odor emission of the ducts. The chemical emissions of the new ducts were negative on average, which means that the surface of the ducts absorbs chemical compounds rather than desorbs. The old duct did not seem to have the ability to absorb chemical compounds as much as the new ducts had. The cleaning of the ductwork proved to be necessary.

A new formula, showing that the outdoor air rate should follow the square root of the standard of living, GNP/cap in fixed prices, is derived. Calculations with the formula shows that the increase of the outdoor air rate since 1880 in Swedish schools and the increase according to norm values for outdoor air rates, in schools coincide within limits of the accuracy of the calculation methods and within limits of how the norm values are interpreted. GNP/cap expresses the value of production per person and year. So the loss of a fraction of a years work is much more costly to day than in the 19th century. This means that we need a higher outdoor air rate to day to reduce the loss from bad indoor air.

This study evaluates the effect of changing the ventilation rate in a modern office building with no problem history. On separate weeks the ventilation was controlled to the ASHRAE design rate (0.4 ACH), no mechanical ventilation (infiltration of ¬0.2 ACH), and full economizer (1.0 ACH). 45 chemical constituents were measured. Chemical concentrations were relatively low even at minimum rates and were further reduced by increasing ventilation. Daily occupant surveys evaluating 25 measures of environment, mood, odor, and symptoms demonstrated a consistently high degree of acceptance unaffected by changes in ventilation rates. Incremental changes in ventilation rates may have negligible impact on office environments since chemical concentrations and complaints are generally quite low at existing rates.

The homes of 30 asthmatic patients living in the South of England have been subjected to interventions involving the installation of a mechanical ventilation system and/or the supply of a high efficiency vacuum cleaner. A further 10 homes of asthmatic patients were recruited to the study as a control group. The interventions were aimed primarily at reducing the number of dust mites in the homes. Concentrations of VOCs and formaldehyde were recorded in the homes on three occasions prior to and on five occasions following the interventions. No significant difference was found in the concentration of total VOCs in any group of homes before and after the date of intervention. Homes in which a mechanical ventilation system had been installed showed significantly lower formaldehyde concentrations in the bedroom after the installation than before this time; no significant difference occurred in the groups that were controls or received a vacuum cleaner without mechanical ventilation.

ABSTRACT States that in the USA litigation based on indoor air
quality (IAQ) and sick building syndrome is on the rise. ASHRAE
standards are being used as the minimum criteria by which to judge
the quality of any engineers ventilation design, so that if an
engineer fails to design a system in conformity with the appropriate
ASHRAE standards. it will be virtually impossible for him to defeat
a claim of negligence. Describes in some detail how dedicated

ABSTRACT A new university classroom building was subject to numerous
complaints of poor indoor air quality during the first eight months
of occupancy. This study was conducted in response to those complaints.
The object was to determine how well the ventilation system performed
by measuring levels of metabolically augmented carbon dioxide.
Carbon dioxide levels were measured by a direct-read infrared
analyser in each of nine classrooms and three hallway corridors.
Tests were conducted during six sampling days in the spring of
1985 and seven sampling days in the autumn of 1985. The performance
of the ventilation system, based on measurements of carbon dioxide
levels, appeared to be relatively poor during the first three
sampling days of April 1985. In some classrooms carbon dioxide
levels were close to or exceeded 2500 ppm. These sampling dates
coincided with complaints of poor indoor air quality being received
by physical plant personnel the variable air volume HVAC system
was subject to numerous mechanical and operating problems at the
same time. However, in late spring and early autumn carbon dioxide
levels were observed to be consistently below the new ASHRAE ventilation
standard of 1000 ppm. This performance indicates that a variable
air volume HVAC system can be operated to provide a consistently
adequate level of ventilation in a classroom building.

ABSTRACT In September 1988 a unique Swedish building research
project will have passed the half-way mark of a three year project
assessment. The User-Healthy Day Nursery has been designed and
built to minimise the risk of indoor climate problems. The materials
have been carefully chosen and inspected, and wherever possible,
low-risk materials and construction methods have been chosen.
The Nursery is equipped with a very flexible heating and ventilation
system to facilitate various combinations of operating mode and
settings. The resulting ventilation efficiency, indoor air quality,
thermal climate and acoustic properties are measured according
to a detailed time schedule. The staff at the Nursery is regularly
interviewed regarding their impression of the indoor climate.
Results from the evaluation of this on-going full-scale experiment
are gratifying.

ABSTRACT Low-mass, light structures, such as many recent school
designs can become uncomfortably warm in hot weather, and correction
by mechanical air conditioning can be costly. The problem was
studied some time ago by the Hungarian Institute for Building
Science by means of computer calculations and model tests, described
here. The results show the importance of careful design and of
orientation, and the potential for adiabatic control, namely where
heat entering the system is balanced by ventilation. The results
of different directional ventilation arrangements are outlined.

ABSTRACT The optimal and permissible limit values of indoor temperatures
associated with the mental performance of students have been the
subject of tests for several years all over the world. This problem
is of great importance economically as well because of the need
for building techniques and/or climate technology to influence
indoor climates. It is necessary to know the temperature limit
values of the room and the important data associated with the
influence of these values exerted on the mental performance of
the students. The results of a simulation test (which were made
at the Hungarian Institute for Building Science) are elaborated
in this paper.

ABSTRACT The design of many institutional HVAC systems is such
that the sensible cooling load is met in the occupied zones before
the system is able to remove the excessive moisture from the air,
resulting in humidity levels in the occupied zones at or just
slightly below that of the outside humidity during periods of
peak humidity levels. The problems encountered in the occupied
zones of these buildings can result in a significant cost from
damage to the building structure and furnishings and to the health
of the occupants. Three school buildings were investigated to
examine the effect of a lack of humidity control in school buildings.
Each of the school buildings had HVAC systems that provided insufficient
humidity control. In each of the schools, a majority of the occupants
complained of respiratory illnesses.

ABSTRACT An elementary school in Pennsylvania was tested in the
spring of 1990 and discovered to have elevations ranging from
5.5 to 76 pCi/l in 25 different rooms. The school is divided between
an older wing that is a slab on grade with an access tunnel around
the perimeter and a newer wing that has half the classrooms over
a slab and the other half over a walk out multipurpose room, kitchen
and maintenance room. Although typically the operation of a univent
heater will reduce radon concentrations in a room because of the
introduction of outside air, it was discovered however that in
the older wing of the school, the heaters were responsible for
a significant portion of the radon entering the classrooms. This
paper is a review of the operation of the univent heaters and
alterations to the units and the operation of the building in
order to determine the radon pathways and how they might be controlled.

ABSTRACT Uncontrolled airflow, including duct leakage, pressure
imbalances caused by closed interior doors, and exhaust/intake
airflow imbalance, was characterized in 70 commercial buildings.
In 18 of these buildings, uncontrolled airflows were repaired
and energy savings from these repairs were monitored. In most
buildings, the retrofit was duct repair. In other cases, outdoor
airflow was reduced and return air transfers were provided. Cooling
energy use was reduced by an average 15.1% in these 18 buildings.
With an average repair cost of $455 and average cooling energy
savings of $195 per year, uncontrolled airflow retrofits proved
to be very cost-effective. Various factors indicate that greater
energy savings could be achieved in the future.

ABSTRACT An investigation was conducted of the effect of decreasing
the air leakage area across internal partitions of a typical modern
high-rise apartment. The objective of this work was to study the
practicality of increased compartmentalization or separation of
the living units from each other and from the corridors and vertical
shafts in the building. Typically, the main barrier to air movement
through a high-rise apartment building is the exterior skin or
envelope. Walls and doors between corridors, units and elevator
shafts and stairwells are much less airtight, and significant
volumes of air can move between these different areas of the building
interior under relatively small pressure differences. Some disadvantages
of this arrangement are that individual occupants can affect air
movement through the entire building by leaving windows or balcony
doors open in their units, odours and pollutants produced in one
area of the building may be transferred to other areas, exterior
walls and windows have large pressure differences across them
which drives air and rain through any defect, and special measures
to control smoke migration during fires must be provided. The
objectives of this study were to measure the actual pressure differences
across various separations within a high-rise apartment building,
to generate and analyze potential ways of reducing the air leakage
through these separations, and to draw conclusions on their effects
on air movement in the building, including changes in operation
of typical current ventilation strategies and fire and smoke control
measures.

ABSTRACT This study deals with the modeling of air pollution in
apartments from laboratory measurements of source strengths, using
formaldehyde and Total Volatile Organic Compounds (TVOCs) as model
pollutants. The sources in two test apartments were grouped into
two building-related sources and occupant-related sources. The
measured source strengths and ventilation rates were used for
the prediction of concentrations expected in the apartments. These
predictions were compared to measurements in the apartment over
12 months. The conclusions were that the model predictions based
on emission rates measured in the laboratory can be used to predict
the long-term concentration of the two model pollutants in the
apartments. Considering the measured differences in ventilation
between the apartments, and occupant emission rate of between
0.2 and 0.3 mg/h/kg body weight could be estimated. Based on previous
suggested limits of acceptable exposures of humans to VOCs, an
acceptable average emission rate of VOCs from building materials
in general was estimated to be about 30 ug/m2/h. The modeling
showed that during the first 200 days, building materials dominated
the emissions. After this, sources relating to the occupants dominated.
On average about half of the VOC pollution originated from the
building materials.

ABSTRACT Heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC) operation
can play a crucial role in controlling indoor radon concentrations.
Both the introduction of fresh air and the pressurization of an
indoor radon concentration levels. Using an in-house computer
model, this paper examines the impact of configurational and operational
parameters of a building and HVAC system on indoor radon concentrations
in a large building. To achieve this, a three-phase approach was
followed. Based on the results of the parametric analysis, inferences
are drawn about the influence of the parameters on indoor radon
concentrations and the efficacy of radon mitigation strategies
is examined. Results indicate that building ventilation rate and
the OA/EA ratio are significant parameters that affect indoor
radon concentration.

ABSTRACT Air velocities in the occupied zone were measured in
a full-size, slot-outlet and slot-inlet ventilated (SOSIV), unoccupied
room. The measurements were taken at different room heights with
two outlet/inlet locations, five levels of outlet jet momentum,
with and without floor heating. the near floor air-flow in the
SOSIV room possesses velocity and turbulence profiles similar
to those of a fully developed wall jet. The velocity and turbulence
profiles measured at the rooms mid-length are similar, with each
representing the mirror image of the other. A full model was proposed
to predict the floor-level air velocity in the SOSIV room. For
a given room aspect ratio and a given outlet/inlet location, the
floor-level air velocity can be uniquely determined by the jet
momentum ratio under isothermal conditions and is determined by
both the jet momentum ratio and the thermal buoyancy under nonisothermal
conditions. The outlet and inlet locations and the room aspect
ratio can significantly affect the floor-level air velocity. The
results can be applied to industrial plants and agricultural buildings.

ABSTRACT Proper distribution of conditioned air plays an important
role in both the comfort of the occupants and the air quality
of ventilated or air-conditioned spaces. Conditioned air should
be supplied in proper quantities and temperatures to meet various
thermal requirements of occupied spaces. Large air velocities,
temperature gradients, and turbulence intensities should be avoided
since these factors, either individually or combined, may cause
draft, which is undesirable for occupants. The main objectives
of this study were to evaluate the air distribution performance
index (ADPI) based on measured centerline data and determine the
effect of turbulence on ADPA. The data were collected in a large
test room (24 by 16 by 9ft) with a high sidewall grille. The air-flow
characteristics at the centerline of the room for 21 test cases
under both isothermal and nonisothermal flow conditions were investigated.
The results showed that ADPI results were strongly dependent on
the room heat load and the airflow rate. The effect of turbulence
on ADPI was investigated using a comfort model, and a modified
ADPI model was presented. The results showed that the turbulence
intensity strongly affected ADPI values at high airflow rates.

ABSTRACT The air flow characteristics induced by discharging air
into a climate chamber with and without a high sidewall grill
were studied experimentally. Over five hundred and thirty thousand
values of the air speed were collected at positions above the
floor level, near the supply inlet and the exhaust outlet. The
thermal comfort indices due to temperature and air speed were
measured under five flow conditions, two with a diffuser and three
without a diffuser. An evaluation of thermal comfort using the
air diffusion performance index (ADPI) and percentage dissatisfied
(PD) was made. Macroscopic numbers describing the air flow studied
were, the Archimedes number, the Reynolds number and the jet momentum
number. The Reynolds number and the jet momentum number increased
as the total supply flow rate increased. However, the Archimedes
number decreased with increasing flow rates. The Archimedes number
was found to be correlated with the Reynolds number, which might
be because they are defined by parameters related to the air velocity
V and temperature difference. The ADPI was found to be linearly
related to the jet momentum number and related directly to the
PD. The throw of the diffuser was found to be related to the corrected
Archimedes number. The jet momentum number and Archimedes number
are related to the air speed, the root mean square of the air
speed and the turbulence intensity.

ABSTRACT The test results are presented from three Reynolds-stress
models (two isotropization of production models and a quasi-isotropic
model) and the standard k-e model for predicting typical airflow
in a room. The flow patterns studied are natural convection, forced
convection and mixed convection in a room and an impinging jet
flow. Experimental data from the literature is used for validation.
The results show that the computations and the experimental data
are in agreement for the mean air velocities, but less satisfactory
for the turbulent quantities. The performance of the three Reynolds-stress
models is similar, they all predict anisotropic turbulence and
secondary recirculation existing in a room airflow for which the
k-e model fails. However, the Reynolds-stress models require additional
computing effort compared to the k-e model.

ABSTRACT The technique of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) was
used to study the indoor air flow field in mechanically ventilated
and air-conditioned spaces. Numerical experiments were performed
in six test sites of different sizes and ventilation configurations.
Typical mechanical ventilation or air-conditioning systems were
installed in those sites so that the evaluation of results of
the system performance would be useful for assessing other similar
systems. The predicted results were analysed and compared with
experimental measurements. More importantly, the potential use
of the predicted results was illustrated. Correlation relationships
between the flow field characteristics and the macroscopic design
parameters were established.

ABSTRACT Fluid mass and energy flows in air-conditioning systems
vary with the changing output demand. In lengthy or complex ductwork
and pipework, the accuracy in simulating the dynamic network behavior
is greatly affected by the accuracy in modeling the radial energy
losses and the axial transport lag. Transport delay consideration
is also vital in the study of heat exchanger dynamics. This paper
reviews the development of transport delay models in fluid conduit
flow. A new numerical model is recommended in which the thermal
behavior of fluid elements can be traced per physical distance
traveled in unit time step. Justifications by sensitivity and
frequency response analyses were performed. The results of analytical,
experimental, as well as intermodel comparisons demonstrate the
promising accuracy of the numerical model introduced.

ABSTRACT The 1994 Great Energy Predictor Shootout II (GEPS) sponsored
by ASHRAE Technical Committees TC 4.7, Energy Calculations and
TC 1.5, Computer Applications, involved modeling/predicting heating,
cooling, and electric energy consumption in two large institutional
buildings in central Texan (an engineering center and a business
school building). This paper describes the methodology used by
one of the winning GEPS entries. Energy consumption in a large
commercial building is a complex function of climatic conditions,
building characteristics, building use, system characteristics,
and type of heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC)
equipment used. Therefore, multiple linear regression (MLR) models
and non linear modeling approaches, such as artificial neural
net work (ANN) models, tend to provide better modeling capabilities
than simple linear regression modeling approaches. The heating
and cooling energy consumption in both buildings is modeled using
the MLR approach. The electric energy consumption at both sites
is weather-independent and is a function of only the buildings
operating schedule; therefore, it is modeled using a daytyping
algorithm. At the engineering center, the coefficient of variation
(CV) for electric energy end-uses varied from 1% to 6% while the
CV for cooling energy consumption and heating energy consumption
varied from 10% to 33%. At the business school building, the CV
for electric energy end-use varied from 5% to 14% while the CV
for Ec and Eh consumption varied from 27% to 36%.

ABSTRACT A second predictor shootout contest has been developed
and conducted to evaluate the most effective empirical or inverse
models for modeling hourly whole-building energy baselines for
purposes of measuring savings from energy conservation retrofits.
This second contest utilized two sets of measured hourly pre-retrofit
and post-retrofit data from buildings participating in a revolving
loan program in Texas (Claridge et al 1996), The accuracy of the
contestants models was evaluated by determining their ability
to predict data that were carefully removed from the training
(or pre-retrofit) period. A comparison of the savings predicted
by the models is also presented. The results from the contest
show that neural networks again provide the most accurate model
of a buildings energy use. However, in contrast to the first contest
(Kreider and Haberl 1994a), the second contest results show that
cleverly assembled statistical models also appear to be a accurate
or, in some cases, more accurate than some of the neural network
entries. When these models were used to forecast the baseline
use into the post-retrofit period, large variations in the predicted
savings occurred among the models, particularly for the cooling
energy savings in one of the case study buildings. These variations
appear to be due to the ability of the models (or inability) to
capture certain energy performance characteristics and the modelers
assumptions about the post-retrofit energy use.

ABSTRACT The principle of good design for natural ventilation
is to &quot;build tight - ventilate right&quot;. A building cannot
be `too tight', but it may be under-ventilated. There is considerable
scope for making UK buildings tighter. However, simpler techniques
need to be developed (especially in large non domestic buildings)
to identify envelope tightness and associated leakage paths. Also
guidance needs to be provided on constructing tighter envelopes.
Studies necessary to assess the implication of tighter buildings
are described. Sufficient information is available on ventilation
requirements necessary to satisfy safety and health criteria.
However, criteria relating to comfort, especially those associated
with odour, metabolic CO and summer overheating need to be investigated.
The paper also discusses minimising the effects of tobacco smoke
and controlling other internally generated pollutants. Guidelines
for natural ventilation design may conflict with other design
or climate-responsive strategies, future work should address this,
and address issues such as ventilation openings (to provide both
&quot;background&quot; and &quot;rapid&quot; ventilation) and
design for deeper, naturally ventilated buildings.

ABSTRACT In many cases natural ventilation may be sufficient to
ensure acceptable comfort levels in occupied buildings. In these
cases, installation of energy-intensive active environmental control
systems will not be necessary. This will result in considerable
energy and cost savings and also indirectly in a reduced burden
on the environment, since the use of energy is always associated
with the production of waste materials. This paper describes the
development of a new model to predict natural ventilation flow
rates in buildings. The model is based on the concept of a flow
network where openings are represented by non-linear flow resistances.
It takes into account the effect of both wind-induced pressures
and pressures due to thermal forces. The model draws on a healthy
balance between purely theoretical equations and empirical data.
The new flow model was linked to an existing thermal model to
produce a new integrated design tool for naturally ventilated
buildings. It takes into account the important interaction between
the flow model and the thermal model and can therefore be used
to predict the natural ventilation flow rates as well as the resulting
indoor air temperatures. The applicability of the new tool is
illustrated through a case study. From this it is clear that the
tool can be used successfully to optimize passive building design.
The optimized design illustrated here not only results in minimum
initial cost, but also in improved passive thermal comfort in
summertime and a reduction in winter heating energy consumption.

ABSTRACT This paper presents methods and results for the prediction
of energy conservation retrofits for heating, ventilating, and
air-conditioning (HVAC) systems as part of the Great Building
Energy Predictor ShootoutII. The predictions are based on hourly
whole-building electricity, motor control center electricity;
lights and equipment electricity, cooling and heating energy use,
and the accompanying weather data. An autoassociative neural network
was used as a preprocessor to replace the missing data and a standard
feed-forward artificial neural network was utilized to predict
building energy consumption. Although the prediction results were
acceptable for the verification of the sample networks, actual
building energy prediction could have benefited by including the
holiday and weekend information during the network training as
well as information from previous time steps.

ABSTRACT This paper describes two projects that were specifically
designed to be energy efficient and environmentally responsible:
one residential and one commercial. It was expected that the projects
would achieve significant reductions relative to conventional
buildings in five areas: operating energy, embodied energy, water
use, use of ozone-depleting chemicals, and construction waste
management. Both buildings were intended to be leading edge, showing
how far buildings could reasonably go to minimize their environmental
impact. While setting percentage reduction in building operating
energy was relatively easy, setting targets in the other areas
was difficult. For the other four areas, there was little information
on conventional practice, the impact of alternative practices,
and what a reasonable environmental target would be. This paper
describes the analysis that was carried out in each of the five
areas for the two buildings.

ABSTRACT A methodology for planning and design of energy efficient
buildings is presented and analysed. The starting point is the
definition that energy efficiency is a question of minimizing
the energy end-use within realistic economic frames and fully
preserved function. The methodology is based on a systematic approach
to the issue of energy efficiency. One element in this is the
introduction of a number of energy related ratios, Energy Performance
Ratios, that characterise the influence of building parts and
the technical systems of the building on the energy end-use of
the building as an entirety. These ratios are selected and formulated
so that they facilitate a systematic strive towards high energy
efficiency when applied in planning and design of buildings. In
the present work the methodology is applied primarily on design
and rating of heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems
with a focus on commercial buildings. However, the methodology
itself is not meant to be limited to these applications. The basic
idea is that it should be applied on all the parts of the building
that have an obvious influence on the energy end-use.

ABSTRACT Eight ventilation parameters (room air exchange rate,
diffuser neck diameter, diffuser type, number of returns, return
location, cage type, room size, and cage rack arrangement) for
laboratory animal facilities were studied in a full-scale room
ventilation simulator. Air exchange rates, velocities, and temperatures
within the room and the cages were studied. Room airflow pattern
and cage airflow patterns were determined using smoke tests. Cage
conditions varied widely among cages within the same room. Cage
type was the most important factor influencing cage conditions.
Room air exchange rate, air velocity approaching the cage, number
of returns, return location, and diffuser type did not significantly
influence cage conditions in the ranges studied. Room air velocities
approaching the cage were not high enough to have a major influence
on shoebox cage ventilation rate. Air diffusion performance index
(ADPI) did not show a difference between the diffuse type, the
number of returns, or return location, but ADPI did show a difference
with the room ventilation rate and diffuser neck size.

gauging the impact on heating loads in a northern climate. Three
methods of terminating combustion air ducts were evaluated: open

of installing a fresh air duct connected directly from the outdoors
to the return side of a forced-air furnace was measured. The results
are applicable to areas of Canada and the United States in which
airtight construction methods and/or local codes require the provision

ABSTRACT The purpose of the study was to assess actual ventilation
and indoor air quality in the Finnish school building stock. Ventilation
and indoor air quality of elementary and secondary schools were
studied by distributing questionnaires to 1264 principals of the
schools. In addition, measurements of ventilation and indoor air
quality were made in 10 schools. The questionnaire for the principals
inquired general data about school buildings, occurrence of complaints
of poor indoor air quality, and occurrence of water damage or
mold problems. The measurements of ventilation and indoor air
quality in the classrooms included ventilation rate, CO2 and particle
concentrations, and temperature and humidity. Poor ventilation
system caused indoor air quality problems in 70% of the cases
by the opinion of the school principals. Building materials or
constructions and water damage was stated as the reason of the
problems in 40% of the cases. Too large number of pupils was mentioned
as the reason of the problems in 31% of the cases. The school
principals proposed measures for improving the indoor air quality
in almost 90% of the schools. In 73% of these proposals, improvement
of the ventilation system was suggested.

ABSTRACT A simple and accurate technique to directly measure the
outdoor air delivery rates to building occupants is presented.
A few (two to three) measurements of tracer concentrations are
sufficient for calculation. Experimental results show that the
calculated outdoor air change rates from the tracer gas experiments
agreed well with the outdoor airflow rates measured independently
by nozzles. A relationship between the local outdoor air exchange
rate and the mean age of air was derived. The proposed technique
provides a way of simplifying the measurement of mean age of air
and correcting experimental errors. Experimental results show
that almost all the errors in the mean age of air (a maximum of
20% in our tests) caused by inaccurate timing of the start of
a tracer gas step-up process (tracer buildup) can be corrected
by the proposed method. The underestimated ages of air in the
step-down processes (tracer decay) were also successfully corrected.

ABSTRACT It is shown that comparing measured indoor and outdoor
contaminant concentrations can be misleading if the concentrations
vary with time and if the averaging periods are too short. In
this article an alternative methodology aimed at estimating the
internal source and sink effects in mechanically ventilated buildings
is described. The methodology is based on both the results from
continuous measurements, and calculations under transient conditions.
The relative importance of indoor sources and outdoor sources
is established by a comparison of the measured indoor concentration
and a calculated indoor concentration of a compound. Furthermore,
dynamic calculations are used to investigate how the indoor concentrations
of contaminants originating outdoors and contaminants emitted
from indoor sources are influenced by temporal reductions of the
airflow rate. Reducing the outdoor airflow rate during periods
with high outdoor concentrations can significantly reduce the
indoor levels of pollutants for situations in which the outdoor
sources are more important than the indoor sources.

ABSTRACT The problems associated with poor indoor air quality
may in most cases be attributed to poorly designed and poorly
performing ventilation systems. The problems in a mechanically
air-conditioned building are compounded if the building is fairly
air tight and depends on fresh air provision at the central fresh
air intake in the air handling unit (AHU). The performance of
such a ventilation system not only depends on the quantity of
fresh air provided at the fresh air intake but the manner in which
this air is distributed around the various zones in the building.
The ventilation performance, characterised by the space air distribution,
may be dictated by either the initial design and commissioning
of the different components of the air-conditioning system, such
as the AHU, ducts, diffusers, etc. or subsequent changes in the
office space layout and furnishing. This paper deals with the
determination of some key ventilation parameters such as the air
change rate, the age of air and the air exchange efficiency, all
of which lead to an insight into the performance of the ventilation
system. The approach is case-study-based and the methodology involves
tracer gas analysis employing the concentration decay method as
a means of determining the key parameters.

ABSTRACT This study examines the effectiveness of using carbon
dioxide-based, demand-controlled ventilation (DCV) to provide
adequate indoor air quality with minimum energy use. A detailed
building energy analysis program (ENERPASS) was combined with
a contaminant-level prediction program (CONTAM87) to perform the
analysis. The combined program was used to evaluate the annual
heating and cooling energy consumption and carbon dioxide and
formaldehyde concentrations. The assessment was made on a mid-size
commercial building designed to comply with ASHRAE Standard 90.1.
Three separate heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC)
systems were studied: single zone (ie. multiple roof top units),
multizone, and variable air volume (VAV). The simulations were
made for five ventilation control strategies: fixed ventilation;
building return air controlled to 1,000 ppm and 800 ppm; floor
return air controlled to 1,000 ppm; and each zone controlled to
1,000 ppm.

ABSTRACT This paper investigates the effect ventilation has on
the sensory evaluation of indoor air quality by occupants and
visitors, both trained in air quality evaluation and untrained,
during three separate periods in a London office building. Results
from the study suggested that trained panels used to judge the
level of indoor air quality failed to indicate the level of occupant
dissatisfaction. A naive panel also failed to show agreement with
either occupant or trained panel assessment of indoor air quality.
Occupants may perceive indoor air quality as unacceptable, but
odour is not considered the main problem. This suggests that the
assessment of odour levels gives a poor indication of indoor air
quality. The study revealed no statistically significant correlation
between perceived indoor air quality and ventilation rates.

ABSTRACT This thesis studied empirically the air handling etiology
of the non specific symptoms of the eyes, respiratory tract, skin,
and central nervous system in office workers, often termed the
sick building syndrome. The results of a four-period crossover
trial in 75 office workers suggest that 70% air recirculation
when accompanied by an adequate intake of outdoor air can be used
without causing adverse effects. A cross-sectional study of 2678
workers in 41 randomly selected office buildings from Helsinki
metropolitan area provides evidence that mechanical ventilation,
air conditioning, steam and evaporative humidification and air
recirculation are risk indicators of studied symptoms in the existing
Finnish office building stock. The results also suggest that outdoor-air
ventilation rates below the optimal increase the risk of the sick
building syndrome symptoms with such sources of pollutants as
present in mechanically ventilated office buildings. Theoretical
examination reveals that the sick building syndrome is a figurative
concept of everyday language, rather than a singular disease entity.
A theoretical model, the Office Environment Model, is presented
to explain relations between the office environment and health.

ABSTRACT Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) have been simultaneously
measured indoors and outdoors at 50 sparsely occupied telecommunications
(Telco) offices, 9 variably occupied data centers and 11 densely
occupied administrative (Admin) offices. Comparisons among the
three building types, as well as within each of the building types,
showed the influence of ventilation and sources. On average, the
Telco and Admin facilities were better ventilated than the Data
Centers, and the geometric mean of the 1/0`s (sum of the concentrations
of identified VOCs) at Telco (3.2) and Admin (5.3) facilities
were lower than at Data Centers (8.6) Admin Offices had more and
stronger sources than Telco Offices, when comparably ventilated
facilities were compared, many VOCs had 1/0 ratios that were significantly
larger at the Admin Offices, Furthermore, certain VOCs were detected
in Admin but not Telco Offices. The influence of human occupancy
on indoor VOCs was gauged by comparing sparsely and densely occupied
buildings. Octamethylcyclotrasiloxane (D4), decamethylcyclopentasiloxane
(D5), n-dodecan (n-C12) through n-hexadecane (n-C16), limonene,
and, to a lesser extent, tetrachloroethylene were all present
in higher concentrations when there were more occupants (per unit
area). Within this set of compounds, D5 was the best marker of
occupant density.

ABSTRACT The radon exhalation rates from four concrete blocks
cast with ordinary Portland cement (OPC) and four with substitution
of pulverized fuel ash (PFA) were monitored for 34 months starting
from November 1992. At the end of the 28th month, two OPC blocks
and two PFA blocks were immersed in water, one from each group
for 5 days the other one from each group for 10 days. These were
then taken out of water and the radon exhalation rates monitored
as usual. It was observed that the radon exhalation rate in general
decreased with the age of the concrete blocks and the rate increased
after the blocks were immersed in water. An explanation for the
first result is that the gradual dehydration of concrete as it
ages will reduce the water content in the pores of the concrete,
thus reducing the probability of retaining radon within the pores
and the probability of radon emanation from these pores. The second
result gives strong support to this assertion.

ABSTRACT Low-frequency noise, centered around a frequency of about
7 Hz was found to occur in several office rooms investigated.
Symptoms resulting from exposure to infrasound can include fatigue,
headache, nausea, concentration difficulties, disorientation,
seasickness, digestive disorders, cough, vision problems and dizziness,
that is symptoms typical of the sick building syndrome. Many of
the occupants exhibited such symptoms. It is shown that the low-frequency
component of ventilation noise is often being amplified in the
tightly sealed rooms. Repeated or long-term exposure to such amplified
infrasound may be triggering an allergic-type response in individuals.

ABSTRACT A methodology for a psychrometric analysis of the problem
of maintaining space temperature and humidity in non-humidity-generating
spaces is presented. Such spaces produce minimum or no latent
load. Several different humidification schemes, including isothermal
(steam generation) and adiabatic (evaporative cooling), were analyzed.
Sometimes design engineers use outside air economizers with steam
humidifiers to save energy. In some cases, the addition of a steam
humidifier to an air-handling system with an outside air economizer
cycle was seen to require more energy than running the same system
on minimal outside air with mechanical refrigeration and substantially
lower moisture load. Because individual locations have different
operational parameters, this sort of analysis is done by the design
engineer as a tool in the selection and design of an appropriate
humidification system.

of 228 occupants who voted on a fresh to stale seven-point scale.
The most significant factors found in this survey for judging
freshness were air temperature and fresh air supply rate. Current
standards for fresh air are questioned and there is certainly
a need for fresh air ventilation controls to be more sensitive
to changes to indoor temperature of only 1 degree C steps which
may occur throughout the day.

ABSTRACT An initial survey has been conducted to assess a self-administered
questionnaire, finger-print and liking score which are aimed at
quantifying, in a simple manner, occupants perceptions of their
interior environments, 450 questionnaires have been analysed.
The average liking scores for groups of occupants range between
- 14% and +19%. The questionnaire responses have been found to
be consistent in two test-retests and in agreement with an earlier
independent survey. The results from four groups of occupants
in four different buildings, (208 responses), naturally ventilated
and air conditioned, are discussed in detail. In general there
was agreement between the liking scores and building sickness
scores but two buildings, each with a Building Sickness Score
of 1.7, had liking scores of +19% and +1%. The questionnaire also
revealed that office temperature, occupant health, and daylight
were important factors. Although minor modifications to the questionnaire
are considered, and have been implemented in the PROBE project,
it is hoped that the questionnaire will become a useful management
and design tool.

cool conditions respectively, &quot;warm&quot; being 1.4K above
neutral in terms of operative temperature, and &quot;cool&quot;
being 1.4K below) and exposed for 1 hour, local thermal discomfort
was reported by 45% of the group. Local and whole body discomfort
sensations were unaffected by thermal gradient (P&gt;0.30), but
were strongly affected by operative temperature (P<0.001).  Discomfort due to dry air was  unaffected by thermal gradient (P> 
0.30) but increased significantly with operative temperature (P&gt;0.001).
Discomfort due to dry eyes increased significantly above 2 K/m
(P<0,001), but was unaffected by operative  temperature (P>  0.80).
Individual difference in thermal and air quality requirements
are shown to be sufficient to cause the thermal discomfort associated
with thermal gradients up to 4 K/m.

ABSTRACT The near-zone of an air inlet device is the most critical
part of a room as regards fulfillment of the thermal conform demands.
An acceptable solution for residential buildings can be to supply
the outdoor air through an air device place behind a radiator.
Such a device provides a mechanical exhaust system that supplies
pre-heated outdoor air. Normally radiator air devices are located
below a window and window-sill. To examine the influence of a
window-sill placed above an air device, several different positions
and breadths of sills were tested. Air velocities, and air temperatures
were measured at distances within 0.50m from the device. The measurements
show that thermal comfort is strongly dependent on the location
of the window-sill in relation to the air device. The degree of
turbulence intensity affects the percentage of dissatisfied people
due to draught. The velocity measurement system used in this study
allows variation of the time constant of the system. When different
time constants were used, the measured turbulence intensity varied
considerable. Some measurements were carried out with the radiator
switched off. In these cases different air velocities were measured,
depending on the orientation of the sensors. This seems to be
due to the temperature and velocity gradients at the measuring
points.

of environmental architecture. This study aims to identify the
peculiar elements of environmental architecture in folk houses
in Cheju Island and Ullung Island through field experiments. The
elements of environmental control of folk houses in both islands
could be developed as design elements of modern architecture.
This effort can play a major role to find the passive design principles
and techniques of environmental control of the building which
have been neglected in the design of modern architecture.

ABSTRACT Indoor air quality within buildings depends on the contaminants
production within the buildings themselves, the outside air quality
and the features of the air conditoning systems. A proper design
of the air conditioning systems is required in order to achieve
a satisfactory result. In 1963 UNI 5104 came into force in Italy,
dealing with supply, order and testing of the systems. UNI 5104
was updated in April 1991, as far as indoor air quality was concerned,
but was still very rough. The minimum air change rate was fixed
at 15 m3/(h person) for non smoking rooms and at 20-25 m3/(h person)
if smoking is allowed. Higher values were foreseen for meeting
rooms and cinemas, theatres and similar buildings. Furthermore
some general &quot;suggestions&quot; were given about the air
filtration.

in recent years. Energy-saving single-family homes are now commercially
available as prefabricated house packages. The technical improvements
mainly focus on minimising heat losses. Windows and heat recovery
through controlled ventilation are principal objects of product
development.

ABSTRACT District heating and cooling (DHC) can provide multiple
opportunities to reduce air emissions associated with space conditioning
and electricity generation, which contribute 30% to 50% of all
such emissions. When DHC is combined with cogeneration (CHP) maximum
reductions in sulfur oxides (SOx) nitrogen oxides (NOx) carbon
dioxide (CO2), particulates, and ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbon
(CFC) refrigerants can most effectively be achieved. Although
significant improvements in air quality have been documented in
Europe and Scandinavia due to DHC and CHP implementation, accurately
predicting such improvements has been difficult. Without acceptable
quantification methods, regulatory bodies are reluctant to grant
air emissions credits, and local community leaders are unwilling
to invest in DHC and CHP as preferred methods of providing energy
or strategies for air quality improvement. The recent development
and release of a number of computer models designed specifically
to provide quantification of air emissions that can result from
DHP and CHP implementation should help provide local, state, and
national policymakers with information vital to increasing support
and investment in DHC development.

ABSTRACT Historically, residential energy efficiency services
have been subsidized by utility ratepayers and by taxpayers through
federal and state government programs. Over the last 10 years,
customers have received free home energy audits, large rebates
for efficiency products and services, and in some instances, free
efficiency measures. Now with deregulation of the utility industry
on the horizon, along with cutbacks in federal and state spending,
money is becoming less available for these programs. As a result,
providers of residential energy services are beginning to look
for ways to generate income that can cover all or most of the
costs of providing these services. The major challenge ahead is
determining how to design programs in which customers value the
services enough to pay for them. Through a series of four community
efficiency projects, Wisconsin Energy Conservation Corporation
(WECC) is striving to determine if residential efficiency services
can indeed be self-sustaining, or if they will perpetually require
some level of subsidy to exist.

ABSTRACT The energy cost of monitoring and controlling a building
environment is a serious consideration for the heating, ventilating,
and air-conditions (HVAC) engineering industry. This work is focused
on minimizing the energy cost associated with the control of variable-air
volume (VAV) systems. All the experimental work was performed
using a low-speed wind tunnel. The authors modified a low-speed
wind tunnel to simulate a single VAV system. We also developed
a dynamic model of the system and analyzed its energy consumption
characteristics. Conventional proportional and integral (PI) control,
adaptive control and optimal control algorithms were developed
and applied to the duct pressure control loop within the VAV system.
A comparison of the performance of these control algorithms indicates
that an optimal control strategy can save up to 30% of the energy
consumed in a system that employs a conventional PI control scheme.

ABSTRACT The considerations made in designing ventilating and
air-conditioning systems in Hong Kong are surveyed to get a general
picture of the current practice. Questionnaires were distributed
to building services engineering consultants, contractors, and
operation firms to collect information related to the primary
design objectives, design guides, and criteria selected: consideration
of the air flow pattern in the ventilated space induced by the
system; and the associated theories. An evaluation of the current
design tools was also made in the survey. The information was
then compiled, and it was found that improved methods for designing
air distribution systems may be warranted.

ABSTRACT Laboratory animal ventilation systems should be designed
to provide acceptable environmental conditions within the room
and within cages. This study was conducted to review and evaluate
ventilation strategies for improving thermal and air quality conditions
in laboratory animal facilities. It has long been recognized that
the cage microenvironment can be considerably different from the
room macroenvironment. However, most research on laboratory animal
ventilation has focused on room conditions. There is limited information
regarding ventilation rates, room air distribution, and other
factors required to maintain acceptable and uniform environment
in all animal cages. Current ventilation guidelines are based
largely on room conditions, not on cage microenvironment. Recommended
room ventilation rates (10 to 15 outside air changes per hour
[ACH]) are based on keeping odors below objectionable levels for
humans and have little scientific basis. Recent research shows
that the recommended room air exchange rate of 10 to 15 ACH is
energy intensive yet does not ensure adequate air quality for
laboratory animals. Field studies show that numerous types of
air diffusers are being used in typical laboratory animal rooms,
and most rooms have high-supply, high-return systems. Expert survey
results indicate that designers prefer or specify laminar flow
ceiling diffusers, low exhaust location and small laboratory rooms.

ABSTRACT Adequate ventilation is essential in houses to ensure
acceptable indoor air quality and to control condensation. In
Canada, the measure of adequate ventilation in a house will be
compliance with the Canadian standard CAN/CSA-F326-M91 &quot;Residential
Mechanical Ventilation Systems&quot;, which specifies the minimum
outdoor air change rate for the entire house as well as ventilation
rates to individual rooms to ensure adequate air distribution
within the house. The five ventilation systems were installed
in the NRC two-storey research house which also has an electric
forced-air heating system. The ventilation performance of each
system was measured for a variety of weather conditions using
single and multiple tracer gas techniques. Their air change rates
and room-by-room ventilation rates were measured and compared
with similar reference measurements in the house with no ventilation
and with only the forced-air furnace fan operating.

ABSTRACT The motor fan set efficiency of residential ventilation
equipment is typically very low. With vast improvements in energy
conservation in other sectors of the residential market - such
as building envelope insulation, air sealing and window technology,
and more efficient heating and cooling equipment - ventilation
equipment energy consumption could no longer be ignored. The trend
toward the continuous use of ventilation equipment is leading
to ever increasing energy saving potential. CMHC sponsored this
project in order to find out the extent to which industry wanted
to develop its own timeline toward the use of more efficient fan/motor
sets.

ABSTRACT This paper presents the results of experimental research
performed to study the flow characteristics of isothermal jets
issuing from vortex diffusers and to compare the vortex diffusers
performance with that of a conventional diffuser. Two styles of
vortex diffusers and one conventional circular ceiling diffuser
were used. For each diffuser, measurements were performed to obtain
a velocity map, velocity profile, and velocity decay at three
different flow rates. A series of flow visualization experiments
was undertaken to capture the general behavior of jets issuing
from the diffusers. Overall, it was found that the vortex diffusers
produce slightly more induction (mixing) of ambient air in comparison
to the conventional diffuser. This difference is probably caused
by the turbulence produced as a result of the rotational motion
near the outlet of the vortex diffusers. The rotational motion
disappears within three outlet diameters, and the flow becomes
radial.

ABSTRACT Data were collected in a large test room (24 by 16 by
9ft [7.3 by 4.9 by 2.7m]) with a high sidewall grille. the airflow
characteristics at the centerline of the room for 21 test cases
for both isothermal and nonisothermal flow conditions were investigated.
The results show that both airflow rate and heat load strongly
affect airflow patterns and air velocity and air temperature inside
the room. As the airflow rate increases and/or heat load decreases,
the air jet travels further along the ceiling and lessens the
chance of dropping into the occupied zone. On the other hand,
as the airflow rate decreases and/or heat load increases, the
air jet separates form the ceiling and moves down toward the occupied
zone, causing air at higher velocities and lower temperatures
to reach occupants resulting in a possible sensation of draft
(coolness). Furthermore, stagnant areas form due to the lack of
air circulation.

ABSTRACT Environmental control systems for museums, art galleries
and other special buildings typically must control more than just
air temperature and humidity, and must often provide much tighter
control than is expected from conventional air conditioning systems.
The priceless artifacts and art treasures housed in such buildings
can be permanently damaged if the environment is not continuously
controlled. The comfort of occupants also should be considered.
Six principle factors are generally considered in the design of
such systems: air temperature, air humidity, light, air circulation,
air-borne pollutants, and sound level. This paper discusses these
factors and how they were addressed in the design of the air conditioning
system for the Sistine Chapel, and provides general guidelines
for other special buildings.

ABSTRACT Most of the modern office buildings and dwellings in
Sri Lanka are designed with the assumption that electrical air-conditioning
systems will be used to cope with the country`s high humidity
and warm climate. The possibility of utilizing passive cooling
concepts for that purpose has yet to be explored by architects.
This paper investigates the suitability of such cooling concepts
for local conditions. Simple architectural modifications and a
few changes in the usage patterns may result in a reduction in
indoor temperature of 3.0 and 0.4 degreesC, respectively, for
a daily maximum and minimum temperature of 30.9 and 27.2 degreesC,
respectively, in a dwelling in Colombo in December. The achievement
of comfort, described by satisfactory levels of a predicted percentage
of dissatisfied, is also documented. Simulation results are compared
with full-scale experiments.

ABSTRACT Evaporative coolers cost only one-tenth to one-fourth
as much to operate as refrigeration air conditioning and are much
cheaper to buy. This make them an excellent option, particularly
in hot, dry areas of the country. An evaporative cooler is a simple
device consisting of a fan and a water-wetted pad. A small pump
recirculates water from a sump (which is part of the cooler cabinet)
to keep the pad wet. The fan draws outside air through the wet
pad, making the air more humid but colder. This air is blown into
the house forcing the warmer air in the house to be exhausted
out open windows or through a vent into the attic. This is quite
different from refrigeration air conditioning, which cools inside
air and returns it to the house. Although the use of outside air
is one major benefit of evaporative coolers, it also complicates
their installation and operation. The evaporative cooler must
be installed outside the house, ducted into the house, and freeze
protected and isolated from the house during winter months.

ABSTRACT This paper presents results of a study of the pressure
drop in a scale model of a stairshaft with closed treads. A 1:10
scale model of a 10 story stairshaft was build to study airflow
resistance within the shaft under isothermal conditions, including
the effect of occupant density. Three cases were investigated:
a stairshaft with no occupant, a shaft with medium density, and
one with high-density occupancy. In addition, the effects of the
distribution of occupants in the stairshaft were studied. The
pressure drop through the model stairshaft was measured at each
story for a range of volume flow rates between 0.0368 and 0.0901m3/s
(1.29 and 3.18 ft3/s) introduced at a single injection point at
the top of the stairshaft. The pressure loss coefficient for the
scale model with no occupants was found to be approximately 33.2.
The results obtained are comparable to published measurements
made in full-scale stairshafts with typical floor heights between
3.2m and 3.85m. The pressure drop varies linearly with the height
of the stairshaft and varies directly with the square of the supply
air rates. Results from the test demonstrate the same trend as
reported in the literature - that the pressure loss coefficient
is a function of the occupant density in the stairshaft. The loss
coefficient increased by a factor of approximately two when the
model was populated to simulate occupancy at medium occupant density
and by a factor of three at high occupant density when compared
to that of the empty stairshaft. The pressure loss coefficients
for the scale model at medium and high occupant densities were
found to be approximately 65.7 and 95.9 respectively. The results
also agree with published results that the distribution of occupants,
whether on the landings at each story or between floors, has little
effect on the loss coefficients for medium- and high-density occupancy.

ABSTRACT Chilled ceilings aren't any easy task for planners and
architects, since the functional principles, influenced by various
parameters, have to combine with the room and ceiling design.
For these reasons different cooling systems with different functions
are normally provided. Therefore, any proposal by builders has
to be correctly compared and valued by planners; this task was
made necessary by the actual status of experiences and studies
in this field and possible by the outstanding standards.

ABSTRACT Thermal bridges are parts of the buildings envelope which
in general are not correctly insulated. Problems relating to thermal
bridges are often severe condensation and mould growth and a significant
increase of the energy losses. At present, these problems still
frequently occur in new buildings but especially in rehabilitation
projects. In several countries so-called thermal bridge atlases
already exist. These can help the designer to increase his understanding
of the problems but they are not a real help in solving his specific
problems. One alternative is to perform detailed thermal bridge
simulations. This however is expensive and not al all part of
the daily practice. This project aims to offer a computerised
thermal bridge atlas for 2-dimensional details. The target is
to have at the end of the project 750 details in the atlas. The
main characteristics of the proposed atlas is its user friendliness,
the large flexibility of modifying the detail (layer thickness,
materials, boundary conditions,..) and the way of presenting the
results (e.g. colour pictures showing the isothermal lines, the
heat flux lines,..)The final products of this project are extremely
powerful tools for so-called global training actions (for schools,
colleges, architects, building contractors,..) It can be used
in relation to all building types.

ABSTRACT After an experimental analysis, an hygroscopic buffer
model has been developed using a set of three coefficients which
characterize completely the hygroscopic inertia of a room. That
model has been included in EDF-CLIM 2000 modelling and simulation
system. The comparisons between experimental tests and simulation
results are very satisfactory. So validated for water vapour,
the approach described in that paper could be directly generalized
for any gaseous component of indoor air.

ABSTRACT A pilot study has been carried out to investigate the
monitoring and evaluation needs in the frame of research on energy
performance and indoor climate in occupied buildings. The building,
situated in Northern Italy, has been completely monitored for
ventilation and energy demand during two winter periods. In particular
four main topics have been subject of investigation. The usefulness
of combining simulation and identification techniques for data
analysis of the building and the burner and in addition the conduction
of a simultaneous simulation of building and heating system. Furthermore
the evaluation of real data for the thermal characterisation of
the building from the energy balance, has been performed. Ventilation
experiments in occupied buildings and linking the results with
energy analysis has been of special interest. At last an inquiry
has been carried out to get information from people living in
the house about their habits during winter and summer periods,
concerning window opening, cooling etc. a link between the topics
will be discussed in the frame of energy savings and comfort.
The presented work will be used for the definition of a future
project with an European dimension on energy performance and indoor
air quality. Further research studies and the use of dedicated
monitoring equipment for field experiments of ventilation rates,
temperatures, humidity, etc. will be discussed.

of nighttime ventilation with a view to improving summer comfort
in office buildings in southern Europe. The study deals with numerical
simulations performed using the TRNSYS code and applied to a reference
building. First of all the potential of three sites representative
of the Mediterranean climate are estimated. A parametric study
to analyse the influence of loss of nighttime air and the level
of solar protection follows. The results are expressed in terms
of energy and comfort indices.

ABSTRACT A program of work involving the measurement of ventilation
rates, air velocities and temperatures has commenced within the
new Engineering and Manufacture Building, De Montfort University,
and some initial results are reported here. Measurements have
been recorded for &quot;summer&quot; conditions, average and maximum
occupancy levels. Results obtained so far indicate that ventilation
rates through one of the theatres are driven by both stack and
wind induced effects, and can be much higher than predicted by
computer and physical models. Room air temperatures show little
variation with time, due to the heavy weight nature of the building
structure and its exposed areas. Further work will examine mid-season
and winter conditions and will contribute to a design guide for
large naturally ventilated spaces.

ABSTRACT The evaluation of the effectiveness of a ventilation
system is a difficult problem which necessitates important experimental
methods and simulation programs which are not always readily available.
The study presented here proposes a period for defining a simplified
evaluation methodology for ventilation effectiveness. In a first
stage the work concerns the theoretical characterisation of plane
jets and the setting up of a laboratory experiment destined for
the study of jet diffusion using the tracer gas technique. The
first experimental results give us information about the global
characterisation of air flows encountered in a ventilated cell
by an isothermal plane jet. They show reasonable agreement with
theoretical prediction.

ABSTRACT The INRS (French National Institute for Research and
Occupational Safety) promotes the concept of predictive ventilation
using the Computational Fluid Dynamics code EOL in the purpose
of improving working conditions. 1. EOL simulates velocity, concentration
and temperature fields from the specification of the geometry
of the enclosure, the ventilation system and the pollutant sources.
It is available in two and three-dimensional versions. Validation
procedures were completed for the 2D version, whereas this article
is concerned with the 3D case. As a matter of fact, 3D validation
of EOL is conducted for velocity under isothermal conditions in
the particular case of a painting area model in the INRS hydraulic
bench. The INRS hydraulic bench simulates steady water flows in
approximate Reynolds similarity and is equipped with a laser Doppler
velocimeter that provides 2 non-simultaneous velocity components.
Velocity measurements are done within and in the vicinity of the
model in a front view. First of all, the assumed symmetry of the
experimental device is checked with good agreement. Then, measurements
are compared with simulation results. Correlations between both
approaches suggest a good correspondence regarding simulation
and measurements. A future step of the study should include extra
comparisons with the third velocity component and as a last step
in situ measurements of velocities in the actual painting area.

ABSTRACT In the frame of the European PASCOOL project, several
experiments regarding single sided ventilation were carried out
at BBRI in the outdoor PASSYS test cell. The test room of 30 m3
has a vertical window of about 1 m2. During a first measurement
period an open cold box, which allows one to control the vertical
wind speed, was placed in front of this window. During a second
measurement period, the window was directly exposed to `real wind'.
The air flow rates through the large opening is derived from the
energy balance of the test room. This approach is possible because
the heat flow through the cell envelope can be accurately determined
thanks to the Pseudo-Adiabatic-Shell. Tracer gas measurements
were carried out in parallel. They are made difficult because
a clear air flow pattern appears and accordingly, the concentration
in the room is not homgenous. An error analysis has been applied
on both methods. The agreement between both methods is very good
and the heat balance approach proved to be more accurate than
the tracer gas technique. a correlation model was derived from
the first measurement period.

ABSTRACT After the new systems were installed in the houses, the
continuously controlled effective ventilation rate remained above
0.5 times per hour, and the system maintained low positive pressure
indoors. The houses studied had a small overpressure (<0.5 PA) even without  the pressure  adjustment.  The pressure adjustment  increased overpressure only  slightly, less than 2 Pa.  The data collected were insufficient for a  detailed energy consumption analysis; therefore, only differences  of  capacity flows were examined during several weekly  periods when the  pressure control was on or off in turns.   Capacity flows were found to  increase with increasing  pressure differences.  The pressure control did  not  affect the capacity flows in the tight house, if the  disturbances of  long-lasting periods (nights) with opened  window were neglected. In the  untight house, the pressure  control decreased energy consumption and the  capacity  flows was obtained when the air exchange rate exceeded 0.9  h-1.  High negative pressure in the houses in the radon  problem areas is not  desired.  The pressure controlled  ventilation system was found to  prevent excessive  underpressurization of houses, without increasing   capacity flows. <P>

ABSTRACT The strategy to deal with two sometimes contradictory
requirements, first to have an acceptable indoor air quality and
secondly to save energy, can be met by introducing Demand Controlled
Ventilating systems (DCV systems). Within the frame of IEA a project
with 10 participating countries was recently finished. The aim
with this paper is to summarize the main findings, conclusions,
and recommendations that all agreed on in the final document (Source
Book), The various control principles have been developed for
base and occupant related ventilation. As an example is given
the case of DCV in an auditorium with energy savings shown to
be 50% and a pay-off time less than a year. Other applications
and savings potential as well as the pay-off time are given for
dwellings, schools, day nurseries, and offices accounting for
about 85% of the non-industrial buildings.

ABSTRACT The objective of this study was to clarify the effects
of ventilation systems on ventilation effectiveness (VE) and temperature
effectiveness (TE) in office rooms. The experiments were performed
in a one third scale model of an office room provided with mixing,
underfloor and displacement ventilation systems. Other than these
three ventilation systems, the experimental parameters included
the layout of office automation (OA) equipment (personal computers
dispersed on individual desks, or aggregations of workstation
equipment concentrated in one place) The experimental results
showed that VE and TE both increased in the following order: displacement
system, underfloor system, mixing system. The VE and TE were generally
higher in the concentrated layout of OA equipment than in the
dispersed layout. However, for the displacement system, the effect
of the layout of OA equipment on VE and TE was relatively insignificant.

ABSTRACT The traditional logarithmic wall functions, originally
derived from forced convection boundary layer flow, are generally
used in conjunction with the standard k-e model to simulate air
flows in buildings. In ventilated rooms, however, the flow close
solid wall is also influenced by natural convection along vertical
surface by accounting for the effect of buoyancy. These new wall
functions have been applied in conjunction with the standard k-e
turbulence model to calculate the flow in an air-filled enclosure.
Comparisons have been made between the traditional and new wall
functions and between numerical results and experimental data.
The comparisons indicate that the numerical results can be significantly
improved by using the new wall functions for the case considered.

ABSTRACT There exist in our industrial cities, many buildings
which once formed the nucleus of industrial activity, but which
are now, due to economic changes, redundant. This is particularly
true of buildings associated with heavy manufacturing industry.
In Sheffield, England, the decline of what was once the largest
steel manufacturing industry in Western Europe, has left large
tracts of land derelict. The wonderful buildings that were home
to the steel industry stand alone and empty like &quot;dinosaurs&quot;.
This paper will discuss how one of these buildings, [referred
to as &quot;the case-study buildings&quot;], is currently being
re-configured to provide new specialist office and technical facilities
for one of the few surviving steelworks. We will discuss in general
terms, the design approach taken, but will concentrate upon how
our resolution of the environment problems inherent in the existing
structure were resolved through the creation of a number of different
&quot;internal climates&quot;. The problems encountered, such
as a lack of thermal insulation and inadequate daylighting, are
commonly faced when working within the constraints of redundant
industrial buildings. We therefore hope that the approach taken
in resolving the problems inherent in our case-study building,
and the research that it has generated, have a wider relevance.

ABSTRACT The space which immediately surrounds a building is often
neglected in relation to its effect as a climatic modifier of
the interior space of the building, because the architect conceives
his building only as a free standing object. However in many climates
this space could be more important from the functional, thermal
and visual point of view than interior space. To achieve this
it is just as necessary that it too should be designed in harmony
with nature and climate and with the basic bioclimatic considerations
in mind, such as insolation, shading, wind movement, control of
light and heat storage.

ABSTRACT Suspended timber ground floors are often used on new
houses, [1], and are also typical of a large number of houses
built before 1940, which represent a substantial building stock
that now needs refurbishment with improved insulation levels.
While the thermal performance of walls and roofs has been improved
in recent years through loft and cavity wall insulation, the heat
loss from the ground floor has been overlooked. This may constitute
up to 25% of the total heat loss from an otherwise well-insulation
house. Ventilation of the under-floor space is required to present
a build-up of moisture and subsequent rotting of the timbers,
and this serves to increase the heat loss. Earlier work showed
that the heat loss may increase by 40% at a ventilation rate of
1.5 air changes per hour[2]. The under-floor void may range in
height from a few centimetres to as much as half a metre, and
moisture enters mainly by evaporation of water from exposed earth
and from construction water drying out. If the moisture content
of the timbers exceeds 20% for only a few days, various types
of mould may begin to grow, which cause rapid deterioration of
the timbers through wet or dry rot. Ventilation is normally used
to prevent this, by means of air bricks in the outer walls. This
ventilation inevitably results in an increase in the heat loss
from the floor, and is dependent on the wind speed and the degree
of exposure of the site.

ABSTRACT Ventilation is becoming the dominant factor in the energy
balance of a building and increasing interest is being shown in
the effects of infiltration. A major contributor to overall ventilation
rates is air flow through cracks in the facades of buildings.
Increasingly, the validation of steady-state models for building
crack flow has been questioned. An approach is made to determine
the equations governing the air flow through simple cracks subject
to fluctuating pressures. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analyses
were carried out for various crack types subjected to fluctuating
pressures. In addition, an experimental arrangement was developed
that enables the laboratory simulation of fluctuating driving
pressure signals applied to a series of cracks. Pressure fluctuations
were imposed on a 1m2 section of wall with a centrally mounted
crack and the overall volumetric air flow rate, pressure distribution
and flow direction were monitored. CFD analyses were carried out
for the crack type and specific flow conditions found from experimental
data. An analysis was made of physical test results and a comparison
made between these findings and the preliminary CFD models developed.
An introduction to CFD analysis and fluctuating crack flow work
is given and the methods used in simulating the necessary conditions
for fluctuating flow with the results of preliminary CFD analyses
are presented.

ABSTRACT In order to evaluate the influence of air conditioned
ventilation on indoor radon concentrations in air, levels of indoor
radon were studied by a continuous electrostatic radon monitor
(CERM) under normal living conditions. Results show indoor radon
concentrations in air were not much more than one in winter although
fixing family conditioner requires a sealed room which leads higher
radon level. Turning on air conditioner helps to lower indoor
radon level. Therefore its total effects are normal< ventilation < exhaust or indraft < exhaust plus  indraft, and  reduce the harm to human.  In summary, air  conditioner is good for human  health. <P>

ABSTRACT An investigation was made into the methods of numerically
simulating swirl jet displacement ventilation systems. Experimental
data was obtained from a quarter-scale physical model that was
ventilated using a swirl jet displacement type system. The data
was compared with results obtained from a dynamic thermal model
(DTM) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation under
the same geometric configuration, flow rate and internal heat
load. The CFD solution was developed from high to low resolution
computational mesh with various solution techniques, the overall
trade-off being between computing (cpu) time and accuracy of solution.
The results showed that for any space under investigation the
accuracy of the solution is mainly dependent on the degree of
simplification and approximations involved within the solution.
When the space under investigation involves a ventilation system
that is highly complex in nature, as is the case of swirl jets,
additional modelling difficulties may occur. The three-dimensionality
of the solution may lead to misinterpretation of results if great
care is not taken.

ABSTRACT An assessment was undertaken on six different public
houses in the north of England and southern Scotland with the
aim of recognising features of their construction and operation
where environment impact had been reduced, what improvements could
be made to accommodate best environment practice, and to raise
awareness of the adverse effect of buildings on the environment.
Air quality assessments in each establishment identified potential
problems in respect of the trading design approach to ventilated
spaces. Selected environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) surrogates
(CO,NOx) were measured together with CO2 as a general air quality
indicator during a 3 month period using a photoacoustic multi-gas
analyser. All premises were installed with manually controlled
mechanical displacement ventilation systems. The traditional approach
to air quality problems arising from ETS has been one of reaction
ventilation when smoke levels were high, resulting generally in
under-ventilation of the space or, in some establishments where
the smoke problem was perceived as being high, over-ventilation
where the systems are operated continuously with a subsequent
impact on building energy use. This has been exacerbated by recent
anti-smoking lobbyists success in persuading the Environmental
Health Department of the local Councils to prosecute operators
of excessively smoky public houses.

ABSTRACT Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) in residential and commercial
buildings is a topic of great interest due to the serious implications
for public health and of the considerable impact on the building
energy load due to air change. Air quality requirements are generally
and simply matched by increasing the air change rate with consequent
large increase of energy consumption. Nevertheless there exists
an alternative approach based on an optimisation of the air change
strategies and of the ventilation efficiency. Experimental and
theoretical investigations have been planned in order to achieve
these results. The experimental protocol is based on a qualitative
and quantitative evaluation of the air flow pattern and temperatures
in a well instrumented test cell adopting several ventilation
techniques and strategies. Smoke detection tracers, tracer gas
techniques and high precision anemometers are used. The air speed
and temperature map of the room give an indication on how to manage
the ventilation system. Position, dimension and set-up of the
inlet and outlet air grids in the room are changed. as well the
air flow rate and time schedule. Several test configurations are
investigated and the results obtained indicate the most suitable
set, under both viewpoints, health and energy. In parallel with
this activity a theoretical study will be carried out by means
of simulations tools, on which a preliminary validation can be
performed by means of the experimental results.

ABSTRACT This paper describes the analysis and practical testing
of a novel method of pre-heating ventilation air for buildings
by sucking the air from the cavity space in an external wall.
The fresh air introduced into the building is pre-heated partly
by recovery of the heat escaping through the inner leaf of the
wall and partly by collection of some of the solar energy incident
on the outer leaf of the wall. A classroom at Napier University
in which the system was installed was monitored to assess the
energy and comfort benefits. Consideration was also given to noise
levels and the optimum control strategy. It is concluded that
the &quot;cavity-breather&quot; method of pre-heating ventilation
air is both energy-efficient and practical.

ABSTRACT This work presents the initial activity of a research
programme performed between different UE partners. The main objective
is to develop analytical techniques and the design of building
components that will be used in low energy office buildings situated
in Northern European environment. A single prototype module of
the external wall has been proved during middle season in a test
cell sited in Catania. The component is a triple glazed ventilated
facade which integrates different passive bioclimatic solutions
such as : dynamic insulation glazing systems, solar chimneys,
reflector-diffusor of the direct beam, solar gain integrated systems.
The prototype has been investigated in terms of heating/cooling
impact and thermal performances, with different fan speeds and
external wall cavities. Test results have been utilised to validate
and to refine the analysis tools used for the evaluation of the
thermal/fluid dynamic behaviour of the module.

ABSTRACT As part of the energy conservation programme of the Finnish
government, a standard method for energy auditing in buildings
has been defined. It is backed by an energy saving calculation
programme, audit report models, auditor training package and a
follow up system. The follow up results indicate that there are
low cost measures which give good savings. In auditing, it is
essential to check these first before suggesting the high cost
measures which, in spite of good savings, are not so often carried
out in practice. In the near future, a similar auditing system
is planned for the industrial sector, too, where the auditing
problems now look quite similar to those of the building sector
before the model.

ABSTRACT Although when speaking about daylighting and energy saving
the first thing that comes to mind is big commercial buildings,
considerable energy savings and interesting solutions are also
possible in residential buildings. Our research is based on the
belief that a low, compact structure maintains the energy stability
better than the classical shapes of blocks of flats. The use of
urban land is more economic,too. - The study of daylighting and
energy conscious design has been understood in the context of
the protection of the interior space and partly on the passive
use of solar energy. These principles can be shortly expressed
in four points. -uniform solar radiation of flats built-in from
three sides can be provided only with the East - West orientation
of the blocks of flats. - volume-to-space ratio must be as low
as possible. - the level of quality of daylighting in the flats
has to be considered. - the improved quality of life is an additional
bonus that can be offered to the user. On the basis of current
achievements, the deep daylighting is provided by light ducts.
The efficiency of sky light is increased by the use of highly
reflective materials in the ducts and by the sawtooth shape of
the duct wall.

ABSTRACT A passive ventilation system in Hokkaido is not spread
at present. This report presents the concept and the housing system
to the airtight performance for the passive ventilation, so two
subject are discussed. The first subject is the changes in the
ventilation rate and the permissible level of change. Changes
in the ventilation rate caused by a stack effect were measured
in an airtight test house from autumn to winter by tracer gas
techniques. It was found that the effect of changes of wind velocity
on changes in the ventilation rate was smaller than the effect
of temperature difference between inside and outside. The passive
ventilation system in the airtight test house was able to supply
the required amount of fresh air in winter when the temperature
difference between inside and outside was large. The second subject
is the appropriate installation of an inlet for fresh air and
the best method for circulating air in occupant spaces. As the
temperature of outdoor air is very low in winter, the fresh air
coming into the house must be warmed. The buffer space under the
floor maybe used as a chamber to warm the cold outdoor air and
to distribute the warmed fresh air. Such a ventilation system
in homes in cold regions can greatly improve the indoor environment.

ABSTRACT This research is aimed to develop the leakage measuring
technique by AC-pressurization method (AC-Press), which applies
the sinusoidal volume changing to the building to be tested. This
paper describes the principles and the characteristics including
the comparison of the DC-pressurization method (DC-press), that
is, AC-Press has less impact to indoor environment during the
measurement, and is not necessarily penetrating the envelop with
a duct for the testing. Also instrumentation of this method is
indicated and the laboratory experiment using scale model with
four holes is executed. Effective Leakage Area (ELA) of the holes
were measured by DC-Press. The results show that reproducibility
is confirmed and that the difference of ELA between AC-Press and
DC-Press varies from -2.2% to -7.7%. Furthermore the effect of
the flow exponent and phase lag between room volume change and
pressure change upon the estimated ELA is discussed.

ABSTRACT The commitment to reduce energy consumption by buildings
has focused attention of making new domestic buildings well insulated
by employing measures such as insulated cavity walls, double glazed
sealed windows and insulated lofts. However in all the houses
there is an air ventilator which is simply a hole in the wall
with two air grilles on either side. To investigate thermal comfort
due to air ventilators position, air flow measurements were carried
out in two new houses where the air ventilators are placed at
high and low level. The amount of air flow into the lounge was
measured, together with air velocity and temperature distribution
across the air ventilator and the lounge at two levels of 0.15m
and 1.2m. These results show that in cases were the air ventilator
is placed at low level in the lounge, cold air flows into the
lounge and the temperature difference between head and ankle level
for a seated person, is more that 3oC.

ABSTRACT In order to evaluate a given ventilation system in a
livestock building and its sensitivity to wind, presence of heat
sources (e.g. livestock) etc.it is of interest to estimate flow
vector fields corresponding to the airflow. By introducing particles
(e.g. smoke) into the air inlets of a model of a livestock building,
the airflow in a laser-illuminated plane may be visualized. Based
on sequences of images recorded of this place using a video camera,
estimates of 2-D flow vectors are derived locally. The local estimates
of velocity are found using a set of spatio-temporal convolution
filters on the image sequence. After which the local estimates
are integrated to smooth flow fields using a model that incorporates
spatial smoothness. The algorithms are illustrated using a scale
model of a pigs sty under isothermic conditions. It should be
noted that this is an non-invasive technique (laser and camera
may be placed so they do not disturb the airflow) for estimating
air velocity in a 2-D plane.

ABSTRACT Prediction and measurement of interzonal airflow in a
building is important in evaluating and planning IAQ, thermal
comfort, etc. In our experimental house, we planed the distribution
of fresh air, passive ventilative cooling in summer. In this context
the measurement of multi-zone airflow in this house, considered
as 17 rooms, was needed. In application of the measurement method
using a single tracer gas, based on the system identification
theory proposed by Okuyama, some improvements were made to secure
accuracy. The additional measurement for the fresh airflow from
outside to each room was also carried out by another method of
constant-concentration. In this paper, these measurements and
results are described.

in each zone. Continuous measurements of gas concentrations in
each zone are usually not practical. The usual approach is discrete
sampling and measurement with one instrument for each gas. Two
methods, the differential method and the integral method, are
commonly used to calculate the interzonal airflows from the measured
tracer gas concentrations. A previous study by the authors showed
that both methods give similar results when the data were obtained
under well controlled laboratory conditions. As tracer gas concentrations
measured under field conditions are often not as accurate as those
measured under laboratory conditions, a further comparison of
these methods was made to determine their accuracies in field
applications. This paper presents the results of this comparison.

ABSTRACT In highly airtight and insulated houses, Osaka Gas has
installed a ventilation and air-conditioning system that takes
advantage of the structural characteristics of these houses, such
as underfloor space and vent sections in the wall. To verify that
the system can vent air from underfloor into residence rooms with
no problem, the VOC concentration of the indoor atmosphere was
measured under various conditions immediately after completion
of the house. The result confirms that the VOC concentration is
reduced by operating the ventilation unit and &quot;bake-out&quot;.
The ventilation rate and the temperature were also measured. With
the client family living in the house, the heat environment was
measured under the heating conditions in winter. The measurement
shows that the present system can heat rooms comfortably with
little difference in temperature among rooms due to radiation
from floors and walls.

ABSTRACT This paper introduces the research at a new type of task
conditioning concept, the desk displacement ventilation concept.
The total research comprises several phases, in which the measurement
and calculation of indoor airflows play a major role: 1. Literature
research on velocity measurement techniques. 2. Experimental tests
of different velocity measurement techniques, in particular the
Particle Tracking Velocimetry (PTV) technique. 3. Measurements
at a full-scale experimental set-up of an office-model, equipped
to operate according to the desk displacement ventilation concept.
4. Comparison with Computational Fluid Dynamics-simulations. After
the introduction of the new desk displacement ventilation concept,
this paper reports on phases one and two of this research project.
A theoretical analysis of the PTV-technique shows its suitability
for indoor airflows. Two PTV-experiments underline the quantitative
and qualitative possibilities. The generation of sufficient and
consistently neutrally buoyant soap bubbles, which are used as
tracer particles, still requires a technical solution.

ABSTRACT The contaminant concentration inhaled by an occupant
(ie. the personal exposure) is usually less than the return concentration
in displacement ventilated rooms. Tow main questions are investigated:
1. Does the exhalation from one person penetrate the breathing
zone of another person placed nearby, thus leading to larger personal
exposure? 2. When two persons are placed close to each other,
do the convective boundary layer flows interact so that the personal
exposure to an ambient concentration field is altered? These problems
are investigated experimentally: Full-scale experiments are made
in a displacement ventilated room with two breathing thermal manikins.
When the manikins are facing each other, interaction can take
place, and the exposure is increased. Horizontal distance between
manikins and horizontal inclination of exhalation flow are important
parameters. If exhalation is directed towards the back, larger
exposures do not occur. When two persons stand close together,
the exposure to ambient concentration is not altered. Traditional
one or two-zone models are not adequate for the case of face-to-face
respiration. When people are standing close or respirating face-to
back, normal exposure levels for displacement ventilation can
be expected.

CHONAN Railway Station has a length of 1.1km. The station is covered
with glass roofs and enclosed mostly by glass walls. CFD numerical
simulation code has been adopted and FLAIR has been utilized which
is the architectural section in the PHOENICS program of the CHAM
company. The result of the simulation predicts summer overheating
at the CHONAN Railway Station in order to propose recommendation
for alternatives in improving the summer indoor air condition.

ABSTRACT A study has been carried out of heat recovery from air
that ventilates a hot tool in a tool shop. The recovered heat
is used to preheat air for the space heating of this tool shop.
Software has been used to analyze the heat-recovery efficiency
and thermal comfort for a variation of environmental temperature.
An increase of environmental temperature of IK yields a heat saving
of 2% and an increase of temperature in the tool shop of 2K. Additional
adjustment of air flow for thermal comfort in the tool shop decreases
heat expenditure for 1%. Contrary holds for a decrease of outside
temperature.

ABSTRACT Non-steady numerical simulation is performed to predict
thermal environment in a passive solar room with a Trombe wall.
With a weather model assuming a typical winter day of Osaka Japan,
the simulation is continued until the test room thermal environment
becomes periodically steady conditions. It needs about five days
using a fully implicit time marching method the time step of which
is 1 minute. The thermal storage effect of the Trombe wall is
confirmed qualitatively and the CFD code proved to be a useful
means to design various passive solar systems. As for computer
efforts saving, a simple method that only temperature field is
calculated every time step proved to be effective. For example,
a simulation in which flows field is calculated every three time
steps while temperature field is calculated every step saved CPU
time nearly 50% compared with a simulation in which all variables
are calculated every time step.

ABSTRACT Modern design of air supply devices is to ensure proper
delivery of conditioned air in a space to provide a conditioned
air in a space to provide a comfortable environment with good
air quality. Since most of the devices have a complex geometry,
it is a challenging task to predict airflow pattern in such a
device. This paper reports the simulation of a complex air diffuser
with the Computational-Fluid-Dynamics (CFD) technique. The &quot;standard&quot;
k-e model was used in the CFD technique. Three different grid
systems were employed to present the complex geometry: cylinder
coordinate with small steps, body-fitted-coordinate, and unstructured
grids. Compared with airflow pattern observed by smoke, the results
show that the CFD technique with cylinder coordinate could not
predict the airflow pattern correctly. This is because excessive
high turbulence is calculated in the boundary layer with small
steps. Although the labor costs are high for grid-generation,
the computed velocity vectors with the body-fitted coordinate
and unstructured grid systems agree with those by flow visualisation
technique.

ABSTRACT A numerical study of the influence of dynamic and turbulent
inlet boundary conditions has been carried out for a forced convection
flow in a two-dimensional enclosure. The turbulent flow is predicted
via a k-e model. In the first part, it is shown that the turbulent
K and e inlet boundary conditions do not significantly affect
the flow pattern. The second part of this work deals with the
influence of the inlet jet profile (plane or parabolic) on the
flow. It is reported here that while the average flow is not greatly
affected by the inlet profile. The fluctuating part of the flow
is modified by the jet profile. If the inlet Reynolds number is
kept constant, this phenomenon is amplified for an increasing
inlet dimension.

ABSTRACT This paper presents a preliminary investigation of oscillatory
flow caused by two opposing free convection boundary layers, which
can be found in a number of building airflow applications. As
second order numerical simulation is carried out to investigate
both the 2D and 3D colliding free convection boundary layers at
low Rayleigh numbers. The present predicted non-dimensional frequency
of the periodic flow and onset of oscillation agree well with
the experimental data of Kitamur et al. (1984). It is found that
three-dimensional oscillations of the flow at some Rayleigh numbers
are accompanied by a well-organised array of secondary vortices.
It is suggested that the Taylor Rayleigh instability causes the
formation of secondary vortices and fingering of fluids across
the colliding fluid interface, which then leads the two dimensional
oscillations into three-dimensional instabilities.

ABSTRACT There are a number of methods available concerning with
air distribution in buildings. Within control research, one can
find new control algorithms which have not been used in practice
yet. These new algorithms open the possibility of developing and
implementing of new demand controlled ventilation systems. In
a building the internal air motions are due both to differences
in temperature and due to pressure difference induced by the ventilation
system. Therefore, one fundamental question is to what extent
one can with fan powered ventilation control the air motions within
a building. The aims of this paper is to report on development
of methods to study the air motions in a multiroom residence apartment
using various combinations of exhaust and supply air management.
The experimental work includes measurements of air flow rates
in door opening in both directions and use of various tracer gas
methods to determine the supply air flow to each room and identifying
flow paths. In an accompanying paper (Bjorsell 1996) is reported
on the results from a simulation of the performance of different
control algorithms.

ABSTRACT One method of maintaining good indoor air quality without
extensive energy consumption is to control the ventilation rate
according to the needs and demands of the occupants. If the system
can be described by mathematical equations, it is possible to
create a suitable control system. Indoor climate involves both
fresh air and the right temperature. There is a close connection
between temperature control and control of internal flows, because
large air motions are set up by temperature differences between
rooms.

ABSTRACT The air jet issuing from a supply device is the basic
flow element in a ventilated room. Thus a careful theoretical
understanding and experimental study of the boundary conditions
at exit, wall and the entrainment region are of vital importance.
An examination of the behaviour of jets in other industrial applications
available in the literature shows that in a closed space the situation
is very complex. There are recirculation effects due to an opposite
wall, and there are three different flow regimes at the same time
(laminar, transitional and turbulent) and finally the enclosure
size can strongly influence the jet properties. Numerical simulations
of such a complex flow can not be successful when one applies
the widely used standard k-e turbulence model. A low Reynolds
model can be used in the near wall regions but the anisotropy
and streamline curvature effects require at least an isotropic
second moment closure model. The aim of this investigation is
:i) to examine the reliability and restrictions of a standard
and a non-linear two-equation turbulence model by making comparison
with experiments, ii) the jet momentum calculation is discussed
by exploring a new momentum balance model and compared with an
experimental method for determining the momentum of a jet, iii)
the boundary layer thickness calculation, the turbulence integral
length scale and time scale which are based on the measurements,
moreover the usefulness of this knowledge in numerical calculations
is discussed.

ABSTRACT Modelling the drop distance using the Archimedes number
is proposed for trajectory control of air jets into a ventilated
airspace. The term&quot;jet drop distance&quot;, defined as the
horizontal distance from the inlet to the point where the jet
reaches the occupational zone, is used to describe the status
of the jet. The models are functions of the inlet Archimedes number,
the inlet opening hydraulic diameter and the inlet height above
the floor. Experiments on non-isothermal jets were conducted for
modeling the drop distance. A inlet, with a bottom hinged flap
and a guiding plate on top, was used in the experiments. It is
shown that the jet drop distance depends on the inlet Archimedes
number, the inlet opening and the inlet configuration. The models
may be used to predict and control jet drop distances in a practical
on-line control process. Ins such a system, the jetdrop distance
is used as a criterion for control of trajectories, and desired
drop distance of jets may be controlled indirectly by regulating
the operating pressure and the inlet opening.

ABSTRACT The paper describes the moisture control strategy used
in the case of a multi-story office building located in a hot
humid climate and estimates the energy consumed to dehumidify
the ventilation air to avoid condensation. The results show that,
in order to achieve a comfortable and stable environment from
both thermal and humidity perspectives, the ventilation (and dehumidification)
system of the building should be operated 24 h/day. If high variations
in the relative humidity are acceptable, important energy savings
can be achieved by switching off the ventilation system at night.
When compared to an all-air system, the use of the hydronic radiant
system for conditioning in a hot humid climate provides similar
indoor comfort conditions and requires less energy and peak power
to operate.

ABSTRACT Most office buildings require cooling in winter, even
in such harsh climates as in Canada. This is mainly due to internal
heat generation caused by lighting, computers, fax machines, occupants,
and so on. This paper reports the result of a simulation study
to investigate the feasibility of off-hour accelerated ventilation
in a real office building in order to reduce the air conditioning
energy consumption while maintaining acceptable indoor environment
conditions. A multi-story building equipped with mechanical system
is designed to be employed in either day normal or night accelerated
ventilation (free-cooling) mode. The study first involved integrating
a multi-zone air flow model, COMVEN, with the multizone thermal
model from TRNSYS. The results from the protection level and interzonal
air-flow point of view show that a coupled air-flow/thermal model
must be used. Finally, simulations were done to evaluate the energy
savings when the off-hour accelerated ventilation technique is
used while still respecting physical constraints, such as spatial
geometry and indoor air environment conditions.

ABSTRACT Great efforts have been made on to predict the air flow
pattern in barns with negatively pressured ventilation systems.
Some of the studies use the traditional air jet theory, and some
use CFD modelling. It is assumed that all the fresh air is supplied
through the inlets, ie. the structure is airtight. This is opposite
of real life conditions, where air leakages always occur. This
paper presents a description of air leakages and their impact
on the supply air jet momentum from the inlets. The results show
that at decreasing air flow rates, the air leakage will play an
increasing role on the supply air jet momentum. If the leakage
is not taken into account, serious errors may occur in predicting
the air flow patterns in a room.

ABSTRACT This study is directed at understanding the exchange

via fire trails, and obtaining fundamental knowledge of physical
mechanism necessary to develop a comprehensive atrium fire model.
This study focuses on the supply air and pressure boundary conditions
required to prevent flow entering thorough the top vent from outside
of the compartment, when the supply air into the compartment is
limited. A series of experiments were conducted in a scaled cubical
compartment with a natural gas burned as a heat source. Under
various heat release rates with different forced air supply, the
criteria distinguishing the flow between bi-directional flow and
unidirectional flow were examined. The result indicates that the
criteria can be characterized by dimensionless parameters of the
Froude Number and/or the pressure difference between inside and
outside of the compartment.

ABSTRACT Field measurements of air flow patterns and stryrene
concentration distribution were carried out in a reinforced plastic
factory hall during normal production conditions. The purpose
was to produce detailed results which can be compared to CFD-simulations.
Measuring equipment included ultrasonic and omnidirectional velocity
sensors and an infrared gas analyser. The equipment was installed
in a measurement carriage which was then traversed in the hall.
The flow pattern of the supply air device was measured in laboratory.
The results of measured cross-sections were presented as contour
diagrams and vector plots. Vectorial velocity results can be compared
directly with CDF-simulations, whereas the comparison with omnidirectional
results is more complicated. The comparison of predicted and measured
concentration levels is difficult because of the spatial and temporal
variation of contaminant sources.

ABSTRACT Visual observation in a slot-ventilated enclosure (inlet
along one side and exhaust through the ceiling) under isothermal
conditions showed a predictable rotational airflow. This was easier
to see and document with a 1/10 scale model of the building then
in the full scale room. The visual observations were video taped
in both the 1/10 and full scale units. These subjective observations
were quantified by air velocity measurements taken at corresponding
locations in the 1/10 and full scale units. Initial results indicate
similar velocities near the floor of the rooms and in certain
flow regimes. Considerable differences exist between the two scaled
rooms near the air inlet zones, especially where the air jet is
changing directions. This suggest that &quot;scaling factors&quot;
may need to be altered in different sections of the ventilated
space for the conditions of a livestock (pig) housing building.

ABSTRACT Ventilation in large enclosures is of special interest
for two main reasons: they have a large volume and a large envelope
area, and the physical properties of the air cannot be assumed
as homogeneous within the enclosure. These two reasons are also
the two main difficulties encountered when measuring ventilation
in large enclosures. The considered methods are related to air
tightness, ventilation performance, visualisation of air movement
and temperature fields. After a shore review of problems found
in measuring ventilation performance of large enclosures, the
contribution presents a description of the methods developed within
the International Energy Agency Energy - Conservation in Buildings
and Community Systems - Annex 26 research program the project.

ABSTRACT A number of infiltration models have been developed to
calculate air flow related energy losses and the resulting flow
distribution in both single-zone and multizone buildings. The
latest development in infiltration modeling is the COMIS model,
COMIS can be used as a stand-alone infiltration model with input
and output features or as an infiltration module for thermal building
simulation programs. The Executive Committee of International
Energy Agency`s Energy Conservation in Buildings and Community
Systems program adopted a working group on multizone air flow
modeling. The objective of this annex is to study physical phenomena
causing air flow and pollutant transport (eg. Moisture) in multizone
buildings, to develop modules to be integrated in the multizone
air flow modeling system, and to evaluate the program. Annex 23
officially ends in Summer 1996. At the end of the annex COMIS
3.0, which is a combination of the simulation model and the Intelligent
System Environment, as well as the reports describing the evaluation
exercise will be available.

ABSTRACT COMIS V3.0 is a brand new simulation environment that
has been developed within the frame work of IEA/ECB Annex 23.
To our knowledge this is the first time that one of the Annexes
of IEA/ECB produces as its main result a validated software not
only designed for research laboratories but also usable in engineering
and consulting companies. Annex 23-subtask 1 aimed to develop
a multizone air flow modelling system (COMIS) encapsulated in
a Simulation Environment (in order to facilitate access and use
of COMIS). An additional goal was to demonstrate the coupling
of COMIS with building Energy Performance Simulation codes such
as TRNSYS. In this paper we present the main results of IEA/ECB
Annex 23-Subtask 1 in terms of capabilities of COMIS3.0, way of
running COMIS 3.0 and how it can be used in tandem with thermal
simulation codes.

ABSTRACT A careful evaluation of the multizone nodal air flow
simulation code COMIS was performed. The purpose of the evaluation
of a computer code is to assess its limits of validity (ie. to
verify its validity within some limits) and to improve its use
ability. Evaluation is an alternative to validation since validation
can never actually be achieved. The steps of this evaluation are
analytical evaluation, comparison with experimental data and user
sensitivity. The methods used are described and the result of
the evaluation is presented. The conclusion addresses the needed
for user-friendly tools and guidelines for the analysis of simulation
output for professionals.

ABSTRACT In this paper, we present new results on the effects
of aeraulic phenomena on energy consumption and comfort for typical
housing using a building energy simulation software (Clim2000),
The presented results are for different heating scenario with
air inlets located in occupation rooms (living room, room 1,2
and 3) and outlets are set up in service rooms (bathroom, toilet,
kitchen). Radiant phenomena and solar radiation through windows
are also taken into account in the modelling. All simulations
use data from the TRAPPES weather station (located near PARIS)
and are undertaken for a period of seven months, corresponding
to the heating season in France. The paper presents a comparison
of energy consumption and temperature field distribution for different
configurations (mono-zone, bizone, and multizone). On the basis
of multi-zone configuration simulations, we could assess the air
distribution in the house. This enabled us to optimize operating
mode of the heaters in each room of the house, so that minimum
energy consumption and maximum comfort according to distribution
of the temperature field could be achieved.

ABSTRACT The multi-chamber airflow measurement method is currently
an interesting research theme from the theoretical standpoint
of multivariable input/output and optimal systems. The author
has deduced a theory for system parameter identification based
on the thermal network model, and also developed a multi-chamber
airflow measurement system as an application. The present paper
describes the laboratory verification experiment and the error
analysis of the field measurement conducted in an apartment house.
This paper also investigates the effect of nonnegative constraints
in the system identification calculation period and the effect
of dividing zones onto the precision. The result shows that the
root Mean Square provides a useful index for the error analysis
also shows that the nonnegative least squares method is more precise.

ABSTRACT The influence of ventilation types in rooms, where its
occupant is the main source of heat and ventilation objects, was
examined using small water tanks. The Reynolds numbers of the
object rooms and the water tanks were equalized to simulate the
ventilation flow pattern in the tanks to its in the object rooms.
The Grashof numbers of a heated body model and an occupant were
also equalized to simulate the free convection in the water tanks
to the object rooms. The examined flow types were upward- and
downward-flows. A jet and diffuser inlets were examined in both
of the types. Of the four ventilation systems, stratifications
of the body heat and effluents were observed in the upper part
of the tank only in the upward diffused flow. The direct reach
of the fresh supply to the outlet was blocked by the stratification,
and the bypass factor of this ventilation showed negative values.
However, the stratification was broken when the Reynolds number
of the ventilation exceeded 390. Only when the stratification
was held, the efficiency of the heat and effluent evacuation was
high.

ABSTRACT The influence of the variation of the thermal boundary
conditions on the global Air Change Efficiency of a balanced mechanical
ventilation system in a test room was experimentally evaluated
by means of the &quot;step-down&quot; tracer gas technique. The
tracer gas concentration has been monitored in 25 to 100 sampling
points inside the test room. The experiments were performed under
isothermal condition, varying the air supply temperature respect
to the walls and varying the surface temperature of a wall respect
to the other walls and the supply air simulating both heating
and cooling situation. Changing the position of the outlet grid
two different configurations of the ventilation system were tested.
The nominal velocity of supply air varied between 0.04 and 0.11
m/s, corresponding to a range from 1 to 3 ach, and the temperature
differences varied from 0.7 to 5oC. Results are presented in terms
of variation of global Air Change Efficiency us, the Archimedes
number whose values were in the range 0 to 181. They show that
Archimedes number has, especially in the cooling situation, a
clear influence on the Air Change Efficiency.

ABSTRACT High contents of organic dust in pig and poultry buildings
have shown to cause health problems (primarily respiratory diseases)
in both people and animals. Dust in barns derives from feed, dried
faecal matter, bedding, animal scurf, mites, bacteria, fungi and
other organic and inorganic particles. Multi-point dust generation
occurs at feeders, animals and surfaces of the room and the fixtures.
Dust particles are transported by the air current which is affected
by the ventilation system and the thermal and geometrical conditions
in the room. some particles are exhausted from the building, and
the others settle on the surfaces. A research team at Research
Centre Bygholm in Denmark has developed experimental techniques
for full-scale simulation of dust dispersion in ventilated air
spaces. An important part of the experimental set-up is the high
mass flow dust generation system which can simulate the dust levels
found in a real livestock building. A multi-point dust generator
system has been built and tested. The system consists of a modified
rotating-table dust generator and copper tubing for transport
of dust to desired dust ejection sites. A commercially available
powder similar to real barn dust for use in the generation system
is being investigated. The possibility to create a very high dust
concentration is a unique aspect of this full-scale simulation
set-up. Research Centre Bygholm plans to use this facility to
determine fundamental information such as dust settling rates
to validate mathematical models of dust transport and to test
dust suppression techniques.

ABSTRACT One of the most important factors contributing to indoor
air quality is the amount of fresh air that needs to be provided
in buildings for occupants undergoing work in varying circumstances.
Standards in Europe and America attempt to define the amount of
fresh air per person, but the data shows that there is a great
variation between the criteria used by various countries. One
conclusion is that there may be no fixed figure, but rather a
variable amount of fresh air required to deal with varying circumstances.
For many years the criterion has been that the CO2 content should
be below 1000ppm, but this along as a criterion is inadequate.
This project attempts to use chromatography for analysing air
samples taken in four rooms. Questionnaires have been administered
in the spaces and an attempt has been made to correlate the objective
and subjective measures. Chromatography is a measurement technique
that has been used for many years in food sciences for studying
tastes and fragrances. This is a pilot project and so there has
been limited time to take samples and survey of occupants, but
it has shown that this technique is worthwhile developing and
studying in more detail.

ABSTRACT This paper presents the results of experimental tests

an exhaust hood driven by a fan above the tested installation.
These tests have shown the concentration of CO2, CO, 02, and NOx
according to the ventilation way. The purpose of this report is
to describe the dependences for different values of air flow intensity
both in air grid and local suction equipment.

ABSTRACT To investigate the performance of turbulence models in
the numerical simulation of recirculating ventilation flows, comparisons
have been made for three types of two-equation models. A modified
model recently proposed by the authors has been introduced and
implemented. All the models are applied with the all-function
method. When using the model, an extended-to-wall method is also
used. Two typical recirculating flows are calculated: the separated
flow behind a backward-facing step with a large expansion ratio
relevant to room ventilation; and the wall-jet-induced flow in
a two-dimensional ventilation enclosure. The predictions are compared
with experimental data. The performance of the models is discussed.
The modified model is shown to be an attractive alternative to
the initial model.

ABSTRACT We have done Large Eddy Simulations (LES) of the flow
in a three-dimensional ventilated room. A finite volume method
is used with a collocated grid arrangement. The momentum equations
are solved with an explicit method using central differencing
for all terms. The pressure is obtained from a Poisson equation,
which is solved with a conjugate gradient method. For the discretization
in time we use the Adam-Bashfourth scheme, which is second-order
accurate. When using LES, the time-dependent three-dimensional
momentum and continuity are solved. A subgrid turbulence model
is used to model the turbulent scales which are smaller than the
cells. We have used two different subgrid models: the traditional
Smagorinsky model, and the dynamic model of Germano. Instead of
the traditional time averaging, the equations when using LEA are
filtered in space. With LES we get much more information than
when using traditional time averaged turbulence models, since
we are resolving most of the turbulence. It is found that instantaneous
fluctuations are very large. For example, in the region of the
wall jet below the ceiling where the time averaged velocity is
typically 0.5, the instantaneous velocity fluctuates between 0.3
and 0.8.

ABSTRACT As the flow inside livestock buildings is highly time-dependent,
Reynolds-averaged turbulence maybe inadequate as they are based
on time-averaging. As a consequence, Large Eddy Simulation (LES)
methodology employing a space-averaging procedure is adapted.
In the present work LES is used for the airflow inside a room.
As base model the subgrid term is computed by the Smagorinsky
model using different variants regarding near wall-damping and
wall-boundary conditions. Preliminary comparative results are
also given for dynamic and mixed-scale subgrid scale models. The
numerical methods used were those implemented in the commercial
general-purpose finite-volume CFD-code, CFDS-Flow3d and LESROOM,
which is a staggered grid finite difference code. The results
are compared with the standard K-e model, the low-Reynolds number
model and a renormalization group model for the airflow in the
three-dimensional IEA, Annex 20 test case.

ABSTRACT A new system of heating and cooling which diffuses air
through knitted textile fabric stretched to form a false ceiling
is studied using both numerical simulation and experimental facilities.
As shown in figure 1 the conditioned air flows through the void
(8cm) between the fixed ceiling and the impermeable part of the
fabric before diffusing into the room through the permeable part
of the fabric. A CFD code using the finite volume method of solution
has been extended to allow the coupling of conductive and radiant
heat transfers at the wall with the air flow in the room. Comparison
with experimental results obtained for a full-scale room is provided.
Numerical as well as experimental studies allow us to draw conclusions
as to the excellent performance of the &quot;Diffusion Ceiling&quot;
as far as thermal comfort is concerned.

ABSTRACT The goal of this study is to gain and show confidence
in the CFD code EOL-3D for routine applications. In this prospect,
we performed a triple study based on the same industrial site
of a painting area: evaluation of free low-velocity air supply
with experiment on a scale model, on site measurements with a
jet-like air supply diffuser, numerical simulation of both configurations.
We are able to confront measurements and calculation results in
order to test the EOL-3D CFD code and we raise the question of
the uncertainty of numerical simulation versus experiment. Our
method leads to acceptable uncertainty indices considering ventilation
applications. Finally, the applicability of CFD modelling to practical
cases is confirmed by our on site measurements in the painting
area. Main features of the flow according to occupational safety
are well predicted by simulation.

ABSTRACT This paper describes two-dimensional numerical simulation

effect of natural convection on airflow is taken into account.
It is concluded that the location of inlet vent and outlet vent
and inlet vent angle have great effect on air flow velocity and
temperature distribution in the passenger compartment. The results
of this paper lay a foundation for the study of ventilation optimization

areas for both comfort and energy consumption is discussed. Dynamical
thermal simulations are performed over a whole year, and the energy
consumption for both ventilation and space heating is taken into
account. This allows to compare the energy consumption of the
space with either natural or mechanical ventilation using the
same conditions of occupancy and climate. For the case of mechanical
ventilation, the electricity used for fans and cooling is included
as well. Control strategies of the natural ventilation system

ABSTRACT In the large courtyard of high-rise residential buildings,
the exhaust from the kitchen, and the gas water heater, is sometimes
discharged into the public corridors, which can pollute the air.
The exhaust heat caused the stack effect, so the outdoor air flows
through the openings at the bottom of the courtyard to the top.
The purpose of this study is to describe these ventilation characteristics
and to predict the airflow rate for removing the pollutants. Firstly,
model experiments were conducted to know the temperature distribution
and airflow rates. The result showed that the characteristics
are influenced by the size of the bottom opening area and the
position of heat sources. Secondly, the comparison between mathematical
calculation and experimental data were nearly in agreement, except
for some inconsistencies at the top of the courtyard. This was
due to the air down flow, when the bottom opening area was not
large enough.

ABSTRACT A unique evaluation and subsequent rectification of the
air distribution system for the Opera Theatre and Concert Hall
at the Sydney Opera House have been recently carried out. Like
most auditoriums of that era, conditioned air is supplied at ceiling
level and returned at floor level. From the outset the halls experienced
significant variations in zone conditions resulting in patron
complaints. Several previous attempts to rectify the problem failed
to achieve required results. Our methodology involved measurement
and plotting of return air quantities under each seat formulating
a return air chart. This provided valuable air flow data and also
revealed design constraints that needed addressing. Balancing
of the return air was then used to force an even distribution
of supply air at seating level across the hall. The final result
is the achievement of a far superior comfort level with uniformity
in temperature and air flow readings.

ABSTRACT This paper presents results of the application of three
different thermal analysis computer programs to Gjovik Olympic
Mountain Hall. Gjovik Mountain Hall is an underground rock cavern
used for ice-hockey, exhibitions, concerts, etc. which can accommodate
5800 spectators. Measurements in the hall are carried out, with
the intention of using the results to verify design tools for
the prediction of indoor climate and HVAC energy consumption.
Continuous measurements have been taken of air flow rates and
air temperatures, for one year. The data has been collected from
Building Management System (BMS). The first computer program,
Fres, was used for design energy calculations. Fres is a building
simulation program for predicting heating, cooling and ventilation
energy consumption. A building can contain one or several rooms
with arbitrary number of walls and windows between them. The temperature
profile of walls is solved with a one-dimensional Finite Difference
method. The second program, LescoCool, is a simple zonal model.
The model couples ventilation heat flow and the thermal response
of the walls assuming i) displacement ventilation ii) a convective
heat transfer coefficient iii) semi-finite wall thermal response
iv) thermal equilibrium for radiative heat gain. The wall thermal
response of the hall can be characterised with a single parameter,
the mean thermal effusivity. The parameters determining these
design parameters (including the wall surface area covered by
acoustic panels) are discussed. Thirdly, measurements have been
compared with the program RockHall, which is a 2 dimensional program
for calculating conduction and heat fluxes through surfaces and
heat exchange between surfaces. This program is developed specially
for rock halls and is the most detailed of the three candidates.

ABSTRACT In first part of fire, when smoke expel can be dominating,
fast operating of the fire ventilation is required. In industrial,
airtight hall, after turning on outlet ventilators, an underpressure
appears. Larger amount of outdoor air will get inside. To ensure
proper smoke removal process, outdoor air flows must be properly
directed. It is necessary to design appropriate air inlets, mounted
inside the hall. Resigning of control over indoor airflow can
lead to smoke spread in whole room and decrease efficiency of
life-saving activities. Problems of air movement in large capacity
room in case of fire ventilation operation are presented in this
paper.

ABSTRACT The purpose of this study is to clear the air flow pattern
caused by wind and to propose a predicting method for air flow
rate through a void space vertically penetrating the central portion
of a building from its base to top. And the method is required
simplicity as regarding cost and time. The present paper shows
results of two investigations. The first is to analyze air flow
patterns in void space by means of flow visualization technique
in wind tunnel. The result indicates that the air flow pattern
was characterized by the wind direction and the height of a heliport
as a roof of the void space. The second is to calculate the air
flow rate through the void space utilizing simplified model. The
calculated results were compared with experimental results obtained
by the wind tunnel. Both results agreed well.

ABSTRACT Human health and human comfort has been perceived most
important parameters while assessing indoor environment. Developing
countries constrained by extreme environmental conditions, poor
building technologies and limited financial resources find it
difficult to adopt expensive technologies for a better indoor
environment. Passive architectures such as inclusion of solar
chimneys can reduce adverse health effects due to indoor contaminants
while green areas can be developed to reduce outdoor contaminants
in the ventilation component. An analysis of bioclimatic architecture
assisted by wind tower system is presented for a better indoor

ABSTRACT For thermal comfort applications, an office air distribution
system should introduce air into a room such that the resulting
air speed and temperature distribution within the occupied zone
is as uniform as possible to minimise areas of high velocity and
to prevent the occurrence of steep temperature gradients. When
considering air-conditioned offices, the main driving flows are
the cold air jet and the plumes created by internal heat loads.
So, in order to study thermal comfort in air-conditioned offices,
laws to describe this type of driving flows and specially for
the cold air jet have to be provided. The purpose of this experimental
work is to analyse the cold air jet characteristics and to attempt
to rely them with the indoor air-thermoconvective field.

ABSTRACT A PIV system to measure airflow distribution through
the pattern tracking on VTR images visualized with smoke or mist
particles are presented. Speeding up of the pattern tracking by
using successive abandonment through F-inspection make it possible
to extract many vectors at different times on multiple points.
Mistracked vectors can be eliminated adequately by post processing
them. Although the usage of reduced search area by predicting
velocity vectors, coupled with the successive abandonment cannot
reduce computation time significantly, it brings the increase
of extracted vectors. Two examples of application to measure a
time average velocity field of fluctuating airflow and a temporal
variation of velocity filed which varies periodically are presented.
They are measured adequately by using our PIV system.

ABSTRACT Optimisation of a displacement ventilation system, and
control of system operation, require accurate modelling of the
aeraulic and thermal phenomena which contribute to the establishment
or destruction of thermal stratification in the room ventilated.
This fine analysis is carried out on typical, although artificially
simplified configurations, in order to achieve optimum control
of the boundary conditions of the phenomena studied. It is based
on an experimental mock-up, representing a room equipped with
a displacement ventilation system, operated by the Poitiers Thermal
Studies Laboratory. We propose two types of simplified model for
evaluation of mean temperature in the room. The level of precision
for each model differs according to requirements. The first is
a zonal model, based on division of the room into two superimposed
regions, with the hot air floating above the fresh air. The plume
is analysed using Zukosky correlations. Boundary layer flows along
the vertical wall surfaces are modelled by means of Jaluria correlations.
According to their directions and mean temperatures, the parietal
flows feed a third zone occurring either below the cold zone,
above the hot zone, or between the two. The temperature gradient
in the room is integrated for modelling the boundary layers. The
numerical result obtained concord well with experimental measurements,
and provide a correct representation of mean temperatures in each
zone. We then propose a one-dimensional model for finer representation
of the thermal gradient in the room. According to analysis of
experimental results, the isotherms are all horizontal inside
the cavity. We have also developed elementary models (formal types)
on this basis, integrated in the CLIM2000 Building Energy Simulation
Tool. This means that the elementary models can be connected to
other components or phenomena (wall surfaces, solar input, radiation,
scenarios involving occupation or operation etc), for global representation
of a building equipped with a displacement ventilation system.

ABSTRACT In Building K of the Head Office in Tokyo, environmental
measurements were carried out during periods of cooling and heating
in spaces occupied by 1) a large conference room and 2) a housing
information service. Both spaces are serviced by an air conditioning
system that employs displacement ventilation. In addition, for
the large conference room, a numerical simulation was performed
for a cooling period using the same conditions as those for the
measurements. Based on a comparison of the simulation and measurement
result, the ventilation efficiency was calculated. The purpose
of these measurements was to determine if the premises serviced
by the air conditioning system have a comfortable thermal environment
with neither temperature fluctuations nor drafts. An additional
purpose was to verify that the ventilation was at a comfortable
level. This was done through calculation of the ventilation efficiency
by means of a numerical analysis based on three-dimensional turbulent
flow, as the efficiency could not be determined by actual measurements.
A displacement ventilation system blows out air at or somewhat
below room temperature near floor level. It is a system of stratified
air conditioning that exploits the difference in specific gravity
that arises from the difference between the temperature of the
air being blown out and room temperature. This system is widely
used primarily in northern Europe. But if the system were reproduced
in Japan as is, people might not be completely satisfied. The
reasons for that are as follows: Summers in Japan are hotter and
more humid than those in northern Europe; and since winters in
northern Europe are extremely cold, buildings are better insulated
and more air-tight then those in Japan. Moreover, there are other
considerations, such as the fact that the temperature at which
people feel most conformable is lower for Westerners than for
Japanese. That being the case, various measures are being devised
to ensure that Japanese people feel comfortable. Interest in this
system has been rising in Japan recently, but projects in which
it has actually been used are extremely rare. The present project
is the first time that this system has been seriously implemented
in Japan. That makes the environmental measurement and numerical
simulation results in this report quite valuable; and they will
undoubtedly be very useful to future projects that employ a system
of stratified air conditioning.

the ventilation performance by the air change efficiency and the
local air change index for basic ventilation systems using a full
scale room model. As a result of the sensitivity analysis for
the numerical integration of air change efficiency using a simple
ventilation model, it should take four times as long as the nominal
time constant and less then three minutes for the time lag to
obtain the ventilation efficiency within the 10 percent error.
Moreover, the distribution of local air change index and air change
efficiency of several ventilation systems were discussed for the
Reynolds number of supply air, the nominal time constant, the
temperature difference between supply air and room air, and the

ABSTRACT An investigation was performed through model experiment

efficiency and the outlet/return-intake configuration employed
under ventilation or heating conditions. The results revealed
as follows: 1) During ventilation operation, the local air change
indices are in the range of 0.9 - 1.2 in every case, and there
is little difference of values amount outlet-return-intake configurations.
2) During heating operation, the local air change indices differ
largely according to the configuration of the outlet/return-intake
system. In the case of a ceiling outlet-ceiling return-intake
configuration, the mean local air change index is approximately
0.3; a very low value compared with that found in other cases.
3) In cases employing a floor outlet system, the occupied zone
air change indices are 0.8 - 0.9, showing nearly complete diffusion,
regardless of the return-intake position, even during heating
operation. 4) The results of numerical simulation and the model
experiment coincide well with each other.

ABSTRACT Indoor spaces are supposed to offer occupants adequate
climate. That is, air quality and thermal comfort according to
specifications given in regulations or standards or what is decided
in order to achieve enhanced occupant productivity. One issue
of increasing importance, is to accomplish the specified criteria
at a minimum use of energy. Ventilation, heating and cooling must
therefore be designed with regard to being efficient as well as
effective. The potential for energy saving design is present for
large rooms. Effective and efficient climatization of indoor spaces
has the best chance for success when the design work is carried
out in a logical, subsequent manner with increasing detail richness
towards final design, and in the framework of a design procedure.
A framework for a design procedure is suggested, and ventilation
and energy efficiency indices for design assessment are reviewed.
An energy efficiency index is developed and discussed for a large-enclosure
with an HVAC system.

<P>
ABSTRACT The main problems with the application of the pulse method
are high curvatures and low signal-to-noise ratios making it difficult
to accurately resolve the local concentration curves. The reason
for this is the demand of a dosing period being negligibly small
in comparison with the nominal time-constant of the room. From
a single-zone-model an analytical relation was derived that takes
finite dosing periods into account and hence extends the applicability
of the pulse method. To determine the air exchange efficiency
by means of the step-up, the step-down or the pulse method definite
step changes of the concentration of a tracer gas at the supply
inlet are necessary. If the HVAC-System runs in recirculation
mode, it would not be possible to maintain this boundary condition.
To overcome this problem an analytical relation was derived for
a single room with multiple supply inlets in recirculation mode.

ABSTRACT When the air flow through a ventilated room is increased,
the degree of ventilation also increases according to the mass
balance. It is shown here, however, that the air change efficiency
in the room can change when the ventilation flow rate changes.
This phenomenon causes unexpected variations in the ventilation
process, whose main purpose is to renew the room air and continuously
transport contaminants out of the room. Measurements and numerical
simulations are used to find a relation between the selected ventilation
flow rate and the estimated air change efficiency. The results
are discussed and reasons for the variations are found by analyzing
room air flow patterns at different Reynolds numbers.

ABSTRACT The concept of Kato and Murakami of contribution ratio
of a supply opening or an exhaust opening are extended in this
paper to other types of boundaries and other parts of the flow
domain. Upwind and downwind contribution ratios are distinguished.
The contribution ratio, the age and residual life time of air
are considered as &quot;transportable&quot; quantities as there
exists a hidden analogy between the governing equations of these
quantities and the governing equation of contaminant from the
point of view of numerical computations. This allows the generalisation
of any conventional CFD code to be applied for predicting the
contribution ratios and sojourn time scales. Some illustrations
of practical interest are given from the numerical computations.

The design of ventilation systems of large enclosures with unconfined

ABSTRACT Indoor air quality of large enclosures containing unconfined
pollutant sources is a really challenging problem. Local capture
ventilation systems cannot be used because the contaminant source
is either too large or even moving; available design principles
for general ventilation systems are not very often applicable
either, because they generally would lead to enormous air flowrates.
It is the purpose of this paper to tackle this problem by using
computational fluid dynamics methods. Two practical examples chosen
in the domain of occupational health are presented. The first
case concerns the ventilation of underground building sites of
car parks. Here pollution produced by the earth movers is made
of dust and diesel engines exhaust gases. In the second example
a ventilated tunnel is used to protect the occupied zone of a
large workshop from styrene vapours produced by the manufacturing
of large fiber glass reinforced plastic pipes. For every example
several ventilation strategies are tested, by performing numerical
simulations of the resulting air and pollutants flow fields. In
the second application a parametric study is carried out to optimise
the design of the tunnel. Both cases have already been successfully
implemented and tested on sites. All computer simulations are
performed with the EOL-3D software developed at INRS. This paper
shows that CFD is a real design tool for ventilation systems in
complex industrial situations.

ABSTRACT An experimental and numerical approach is used to improve
the understanding of air movement within air-conditioned offices
with a fan-coil unit located below the window. The numerical results
of temperatures and velocities fields are in good agreement with
full-scale experiments. The influence of different supply parameters
was analysed both under heating and cooling conditions. Results
showed that the behaviour of air flow within a room was various
and it was possible to find the appropriate dimensioning and supply
conditions of air-conditioning systems operating both for heating
and cooling and providing comfortable indoor environment.

ABSTRACT In many applications the 3-D distribution of temperature
in an imperfectly mixed ventilated air space is determined by
the air mass transport or the flow pattern. A grey box model hase
been developed to predict the dynamic behavior of the 3-D distribution
of temperature to non-linear variations of the ventilation rate
V and heat supply Q (Watt) as control inputs. In the grey box
model physical laws are combined with a mathematical identification
procedure. Every parameter has a physical meaning which can be
interpreted in relation to the air flow pattern. In a laboratory
test installation 100 experiments were performed to identify the
model parameters in function of the ventilation rate and the heat
supply as control inputs. After the identification procedure five
validation experiments were performed in which the ventilation
rate was varied randomly between 80 and 300m3/h and in which the
heat supply was set to a constant level of 0 or 400 Watt. From
all these validation experiments the model was found to predict
temperature with a mean square error of 0.3C.

ABSTRACT Two-dimensional, isothermal full-scale experiments and
CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) simulations are used to investigate
the influence of obstacles in the occupied zones. The shape of
the vertical velocity profiles, the maximum velocities in the
occupied zone, the velocity decay through the room, and the momentum
flow are investigated. It is found that the maximum velocity in
the occupied zone, and the velocity level in the entire room decrease
when obstacles are present in the room. The velocity profile changes
shape and the maximum velocity in the lower part of the room is
located higher above the floor than in the empty room. It is found
that the obstacles influence the flow in the entire room, and
because the obstacles not only redistribute the velocity profile
but also decrease the overall velocity level in the room the momentum
flow is reduced.

ABSTRACT The use of various air flow models at different levels
of complexity as design tools of the ventilation of atria is discussed.
Advantages and requirements are explained. For an atrium space
in an office building, Grafenau Zug, Switzerland, measured data
are compared with model prediction. Temperatures at different
heights in the atrium and outside are monitored throughout the
year by the building control system. In addition, velocity profiles
in the occupied zone and the airleakage characteristics of the
whole atrium have been measured. Simple models for downdraft along
cold glazings and natural ventilation in summer, and complex models
involving computational fluid dynamics, are applied and compared
with the collected experimental data.

ABSTRACT This paper describes research into the flow and stratification
in naturally ventilated rooms containing either point sources
of heat or a distributed source of heat on one vertical wall.
Plumes from point sources on the floor of the room with vents
at the top and bottom produce a vertical density profile consisting
of several distinct, fully mixed layers. The paper includes a
summary of a theoretical model that predicts the depths and densities
of these layers. The positions of the interfaces between the layers
are found to be function only of the effective area, A, of the
enclosure openings the height of the enclosure, H, and the ratios
of the strengths of the two sources of heat. The theoretical approach
has been validated using water-filled scale models. In the case
where one wall of the room is uniformly heated a multiple-layer
stratification also develops.

ABSTRACT Based on the equations for mass balance, energy conservation
and vertical momentum and on the modified Bernouilli equation,
a set of formulas is derived for air velocities, temperature differences
and ventilation capacities in relation to opening areas, net heat
input, and building geometry. The validity of the formulas is
discussed in relation to temperature stratification, position
of the neutral plane, and the orientation of the openings. Further,
specific topics are discussed concerning air velocity and ventilation
capacity as affected by the opening area ratio (ie. inlet area/outlet
area), optimum opening area ratio, and finally the size of required
opening area related to required ventilation capacity or required
temperature difference. The set of formulas constitutes an easy-to-use
design method that can be programmed as an independent computer
program or integrated into a building energy analysis tool. Besides,
the formulas are well suited for analytical purposes.

ABSTRACT Measurements of ventilation rates, air velocities and

in the Queens Building, De Montfort University, Leicester, UK.
Modelling of &quot;winter&quot; conditions in the above space

produced values for air temperatures and room air velocities,
at different points in time, using external pressure boundary
conditions at inlets and outlets. A comparison is made in this
paper between the measured and calculated results. This work emphasises
the difficulties in modelling large naturally ventilated spaces
and the importance of accurate representation of boundary conditions.

ABSTRACT It has been impossible to predict the air change rate
of a room with a single opening exposed to natural wind by the
pressure differences generated by the wind. In order to establish
the simple method to predict the airflow rate through a single
opening, some experiments were conducted with a cubic model enclosure
containing a single opening in a wind tunnel. Under several conditions
of wind velocity, wind direction and approaching flow, characteristics
of local airflow in the vicinity of opening and airflow rate through
an opening were measured. through investigations, it is found
that the airflow rate is in proportion to local mean velocity
in the vicinity of the opening. In conclusion, the ultimate equation
for predicting the air flow rate of a room with a single opening
exposed to natural wind was presented in this paper.

ABSTRACT This paper describes an innovative study in which small-scale
laboratory experiments and simple theoretical models examine natural
ventilation by the combined effects of stack and wind and are
used to predict the airflow and temperature stratification within
an enclosure under a wide range of climatic conditions. In the
present experiments a Perspex tank of rectangular cross-section
is suspended in a flume. The flume produces a controllable, steady
horizontal flow which is used to model the wind. A number of openings
in the tank both at high/low levels and on windward/leeward faces
allow a wide range of generic ventilation flows to be examined.
In this paper two main ventilation flows have been identified:
i) those where the buoyancy and wind forces reinforce one another
and ii) those where the buoyancy and wind forces oppose one another.
The experiments have shown that the type of ventilation flow observed,
ie. whether displacement or mixing, is critically dependent upon
the relative magnitudes of the wind and buoyancy forces as well
as upon the size and location of the openings. Some of the implications
of the flows to the natural ventilation of enclosures are discussed.

ABSTRACT This case study comprises a monitoring programme as well
as a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis of a natural
ventilated atrium. The purpose has been to analyse the performance
of a typical natural ventilation system in Denmark under both
summer and winter conditions. The monitoring programme consisted
of measurements in two short-term periods under summer and winter
conditions, respectively. Vertical temperature distribution, surface
temperatures, air change rates and thermal comfort conditions
were measured. CFD simulations were carried out in the same cases.
The influence of the inlet opening position and the solar radiation
on thermal comfort and ventilation capacity were also investigated.
The results showed a well working natural ventilation system under
both winter and summer conditions. The results also showed that
CFD simulation was a useful tool to predict the performance of
the system.

ABSTRACT Many buildings in Japan are furnished with a large stairwell
in the centre, called &quot;void&quot;. Gas water heaters are
often installed in the void, consuming the air inside and discharging
the exhaust gas into the void. The behaviour of the exhaust gas
in the void space has become a great concern. Model experiment
and three dimensional CFD have been conducted to investigate,
in detail, flow characteristics in the void space. The study selects
a simple rectangular void space which accommodates gas water heaters
discharging exhaust gas from the corners. Good agreement has been
obtained between the CFD results and experimental data regarding
the velocity distribution at the top of the void, thereby validating
the CFD method employing the k-e model of turbulence. Detailed
consideration has been made to identify the flow field in the
void space by using the CFD results.

ABSTRACT An enclosing fence around a single unit house often gives
strong influence on the indoor airflow caused by cross-ventilation.
The influence of fences on cross-ventilation is examined by CFD
(Computational Fluid Dynamics) in this paper. The calculation
area of numerical simulations of cross-ventilation should have
not only the indoor space but also the surrounding outdoor space
of a house to analyze the airflow continuously. The heights of
fences and the distances between fences and a model house are
used as parameters of simulation models. The results of the numerical
simulations for the model houses with the fences are compared
each other and with that of the model house without the fence.
When the fence is higher, the indoor airflow pattern greatly changed
and the cross-ventilation rate decreases. However, the distance
between the fence and the model house has little influence on
both the indoor airflow pattern and the cross-ventilation rate.

ABSTRACT Airflow within an apartment is important for the performance
in terms of providing thermal comfort. Cross-ventilation is the
most effective cooling method against the hot-humid climate. This
paper aims to study impact of partition walls on air velocity
and air distribution in apartments with cross-ventilation. Airflow
patterns and velocities in six apartments, constructed in southern
China, have been studied. A commercial program Flovent, based
on Computational Fluid Dynamics, is used for simulations. The
results of the study have indicated that the different modification
of internal walls designed by users create different airflow patterns
within the same configuration of the apartments. They have a significant
influence on internal air distribution. In one bedroom ventilation
is bad, but if ventilated holes are added to the partition wall
of the room, ventilation within the room could be improved.

Fluid Dynamics (CFD). The basic model house of numerical simulation
is a cubic box with two relatively large windows on the opposite
walls. The windows are designed as bay windows which jut outsides
from the walls. The model house is changed by the depth of the
windows. The mathematical model of turbulence in the numerical
simulations is k-e e equation model. The changes of indoor airflow
patterns, ventilation rates and pressure losses at the windows
by the depth of the windows are examined from the results of the
numerical simulations, which shows the possibility and the necessity
of the practical use of CFD,

the local air change index at respiration zone turned out nearly

ABSTRACT The vertical temperature gradient is normally given as
a linear temperature distribution between a minimum temperature
close to the floor and a maximum temperature close to the ceiling.
The minimum temperature can either be a constant fraction of a
load dependent difference or it can be connected to the volume
flow to the room. This paper describes a new model which takes
the different types of heat sources in the occupied zone as well
as the characteristic Archimedes number of the flow into account.
Full-scale experiments with different heat sources as: Distributed
heat sources, Sedentary persons, Ceiling light and a Point heat
source have been used in the development.

ABSTRACT In a room with displacement ventilation the temperature
gradient is of great interest as its size limits the use for this
type of ventilation. Simplified models for calculating the temperature
gradient in a room with no resulting heat transport through the
perimeter have earlier been presented. Complex multi-node models
including heat transfer through the walls have also been presented
in the literature, the use of these however require a small workstation.
This paper will present an extended model where the resulting
heat load removed by ventilation as well as the temperature gradient
in the room can be easily calculated in a spread sheet on a PC.
Solar radiation can be include in the heat balance as well as
the influence of the nature of the heat sources in the room.

and tracer gas concentration distribution in the plume and its
surrounding. Plumes above heat sources of different parameters
were simulated by means of special simulator. The measurements
were made at different flow rates of ventilating air and different
initial values of the plume parameters. The tests were carried
out in a test room of dimensions 2.0x2.4x2.0m. Those tests conditions
correspond to the conditions of the displacement ventilation model
known as &quot;filling box with a plume&quot;. Characteristics
of the boundary layer between the zones were defined and the way

ABSTRACT Displacement ventilation offers improved air quality
and reduced cooling costs relative to ventilation systems that
mix supply and room air. However, thermal stratification at high
internal loads can cause excessive variation of temperature with
height which violates thermal comfort requirements. A series of
experiments were performed in a geometrically similar scale model
of an open-plan office space. The model was filled with a gaseous
refrigerant to establish fluid-dynamic similitude by matching
the Reynolds, Archimedes and Prandtl numbers. Vertical temperature
profiles and flow patterns were recorded.

Abstract: Describes how the Residential Construction Demonstration
Program provides pointers on duct sealing methods and program
design. In the Northwest, energy losses in forced-air systems
average 25%-30% in electrically heated homes, with some homes
being significantly worse. This appears to be the case in other
regions of the United States as well. The Bonneville Power Administration
(BPA) created the Residential Construction Demonstration Program
(RCDP) to test innovations in energy efficiency and evaluate their
effectiveness. In 1994 RCDP turned its attention to forced-air
distribution systems. Under the program, state energy offices
in Idaho, Montana, Oregon and Washington worked with BPA to recruit
and train contractors to build tight new systems and to retrofit
older ones. Researchers from the energy offices tested each of
the 41 new houses and 25 retrofit houses for duct tightness and
house operating pressures. This article summarises the most valuable
results and recommendations of these case studies.

Abstract: Terminals on the exhausts of all types of ventilation
systems alter system performance as they interact with the exhaust
flow and the wind. They cause a pressure loss and the wind may
either assist the exhaust flow, cause a resistance or even flow
reversal. The precise effects depend on terminal design, exhaust
flow rate, wind speed, wind angle and wind direction. This paper
discusses a suitable test procedure and rating method which allows
terminals to be selected on a basis of performance. The widely
varying performance of some popular designs is discussed. The
results indicate those terminals that may cause flow reversal,
that have good extractive qualities and that have high resistive
properties.

Abstract: Field investigations were done in seven restaurants
(sub-sample of a study of 63 commercial buildings) to identify
uncontrolled airflows and pressure imbalances. Testing included
building airtightness tests, identification of building air barrier
locations, duct system airtightness, characterisation of pressure
differentials, building airflow balance, and infiltration/ventilation
rates. All restaurants were found to operate at negative pressures
that ranged from -0.003 in w.c. (-0.8 Pa) to -0.173 in w.c. (-43
Pa) and averaged -0.051 in. w.c. (-12.7 Pa) under normal operation.
The variables that affect depressurisation are large exhaust fans,
missing or undersized make up air, intermittent outdoor air caused
by the cycling of air handlers, dirty outdoor air and make up
air filters, and building airtightness. These uncontrolled airflows
and pressure imbalances impact energy use, ventilation rates,
sizing of heating and air-conditioning systems, indoor comfort,
relative humidity, moisture damage to building materials, mold
and mildew growth, operation of combustion equipment, and indoor
air quality.

Abstract: The accuracy of numerical predictions based on large
eddy simulation (LES), the differential stress model (DSM), the
algebraic stress model (ASM), and the standard k-e eddy viscosity
model (k-e EVM) is examined for the turbulent flow field around
a building. Here, a surface-mounted cube is used as the model
of a building. The accuracy and relative performance of these
four turbulence models are assessed by comparing them with experimental
data. The differences between the results given by these turbulence
models are examined by comparing the distribution of velocity
vectors, mean pressure coefficients (Cp), turbulence energy (k),
turbulence production (Pk), and normal stress components (u',u'),
etc.

Abstract: Knowledge of air flow patterns and thermal parameters
are essential in the design of a ventilation system for large
enclosures. The objective of this paper is to evaluate the possibility
of using computer simulation to predict the airflow pattern and
removal effectiveness of ventilation systems in large enclosures.
The quality of air and thermal comfort in a three-floor shopping
centre are studied by the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method.
Two ventilation systems are selected. In System 1, rooms are ventilated
by two ceiling slot diffusers, supplying air downward into the
rooms. The halls are equipped with wall jet diffusers, delivering
air in a horizontal direction. Airflow and air quality, under
both summer and winter conditions, are investigated. In System
2, the air in each room is supplied in a radial manner by four
ceiling rectangular diffusers. The hall and balconies have jet
diffusers which supply air vertically downward. Different ventilation
rates, outdoor air ratios and supply air temperatures are studies.
Occupants are simulated by heat and CO2 sources without aerodyamic
blockages. It was found that the summer and winter air temperature
difference in the shopping centre differ by approximately 2 oC.
The rectangular air diffusers should be used in the rooms and
the jet diffusers in the halls and balconies. Both the variable
air volume and the constant air conditioning control in a large

Abstract: In this article, five k-e, two-equation models are studied:
the standard k-e model, a low-Reynolds-number k-e model, a two-layer
k-e model, a two-scale k-e model, and a renormalization group
(RNG) k-e model. They are evaluated for their performance in predicting
natural convection, forced convection, and mixed convection in
rooms, as well as an impinging jet flow. Corresponding experimental
data from the literature are used for validation. It is found
that the prediction of the mean velocity is more accurate than
that of the turbulent velocity. These models are neither able
to predict anisotropic turbulence correctly nor to pick up the
secondary recirculation of indoor air flow; otherwise the performance
of the standard k-e model is good. The RNG k-e model is slightly
better than the standard k-e model and is therefore recommended
for simulations of indoor air flow. The performance of the other
models is not stable.

Abstract: The CFX software from Computational Fluid Dynamics Services
(CFDS) is used routinely by a number of major companies in the
building industry. Founded on more that 20 years experience in
CFD modelling, CFX is a general purpose CFD code which boasts
geometrical flexibility, advanced physical models and powerful
numerical methods. A CFX simulation predicts the velocity fields,
pressure and temperature at all points within or around the building,
data which can then be visualised with the state of the art graphical
post processors in the software. The resulting images provide
the designer with a clear and detailed understanding of the efficiency
of the HVAC systems, information which would be prohibitively
expensive or impossible to obtain experimentally.

Abstract: Differential flow control is the most common method
of room pressurization practiced today. It has long been applied
to constant-volume spaces and is now frequently applied in variable-volume
rooms as well. However, differential flow is not a direct indication
of pressurization. As a result, questions have lingered about
where it should be applied and what it takes to ensure success.
This paper analyzes the relationship between a controlled differential
flow and the actual infiltration flows from the surrounding spaces.
Several fairly simple cases are examined to establish some limits
on the applicability of this concept. The following conclusions
are drawn. The method is extremely reliable when the pressurized
space is in contact with one other space. In more complicated
layouts, infiltration paths significantly increase the flow difference
needed for negative pressurization. Also in more complicated layouts,
changes in the surrounding pressures can cause pressurization
to fail. Infiltration paths to spaces with varying pressures (including
the outside of the building) should be minimized.

Abstract: This paper presents four new empirical equations for
the prediction of the centreline velocity in front of circular
and slot exhaust openings, both plain and flanged. Such new, easy
to use equations come from a mathematical treatment of the experimental
data obtained by the authors. The suggested equations were developed
by means of a regression analysis fitting the experimental data.
Finally the dimensionless predicted velocities inferred from the
authors' equations were compared with the ones derived from the
main empirical equations available in technical literature for
the calculation of centerline velocity gradients in front of freestanding
hoods.

Abstract: Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is used to predict
the indoor environment of a mechanically ventilated room and overall
ventilation effectiveness of air distribution systems. The predictions
of indoor thermal comfort is based on Fanger's comfort equations
incorporated into the CFD model. A radiation heat exchange model
is included for the calculation of mean radiant temperature as
well as heat transfer through room boundaries. The overall ventilation
effectiveness is related to the energy required for achieving
indoor thermal comfort and good air quality. These indices were
used to evaluate room air distribution systems for heating and
cooling operations. It has been found that the most effective
air distribution system for heating operation differs from that
for cooling. It is shown that an air distribution system that
results in upward displacement ventilation performs better than
others in terms of indoor air quality and energy use by may cause
local thermal discomfort.

Abstract: Local thermal discomfort in offices with displacement
ventilation is investigated using computational fluid dynamics.
The standard k-e turbulence model is used for the prediction of
indoor air flow patterns, temperature and moisture distributions,
taking account of heat transfer by conduction, convection and
radiation. The thermal comfort level and draught risk are predicted
by incorporating Fanger's comfort equations in the airflow model.
It has been found that for sedentary occupants with summer clothing
common complaints of discomfort in offices ventilated with displacement
systems result more often from an unsatisfactory thermal sensation
level than from draught alone. It is shown that thermal discomfort
in the displacement ventilated offices can be avoided by optimizing
the supply air velocity and temperature. It is also shown that
optimal supply air conditions of a displacement system depend
on the distance between the occupant and air diffuser.

Abstract: The ventilation design concept, model experiment results,
two-dimensional computational fluid dynamics simulation, and on-site
measurements are presented for the Danish Pavilion project at
the 1992 World Exhibition in Seville. The paper gives a short
project history for the building and the ventilation system. The
air-conditioned restaurant and exhibition hall have a floor area
of 450 m2 (4,850 ft2) and a mean height of 18m (59 ft). It is
ventilated by a 'cooling wall' with a height of 12m (39 ft). The
flow from the cooling wall is similar to the flow in a room with
displacement ventilation. Scale-model experiments and computational
fluid dynamics simulations indicate a velocity level in the occupied
zone of approximately 0.6m/s (120fpm) and the results are confirmed
by on-site measurement in the exhibition hall. It is shown that
even a simplified two-dimensional flow simulation will give valuable
information to be used in the design procedure.

Abstract: Glazed facades may cause thermal discomfort due to downdraught.
Convectors placed close to the facade can prevent downdraught
but cause an increase in the energy consumption. The objective
of the research has been to investigate if the structural system
of a glazed facade can be used to reduce downdraught and to avoid
thermal comfort problems in the occupied zone. The effect of large
obstacles on a cold boundary layer flow has been investigated
for different temperature differences between a cold surface and
the room air, different distances between the obstacles and different
sizes of the obstacles. The effect of the obstacles on the boundary
layer flow depended on the characteristics of the flow and of
the sizes of the obstacles. With turbulent flow and an obstacle
larger than the boundary layer thickness the boundary layer flow
separated from the surface and a new boundary layer was established
below the obstacle. The risk of thermal discomfort due to downdraught
was reduced considerably.

Abstract: In buildings with large glazed facades there may by
problems with thermal discomfort due to downdraught. Convectors
placed close to the facade can prevent this but they will cause
an increased energy consumption. Recent research has shown that
the risk of thermal discomfort due to downdraught can be reduced
by structural measures. Laboratory experiments has shown that
large obstacles, such as the structural system of a glazed facade,
which is placed in the cold boundary layer, can reduce downdraught
considerably. This paper deals with the ability of Computational
Fluid Dynamics to predict downdraught at a plane wall and at a
wall with large obstacles. Quite simple boundary conditions were
used in this study. Predictions of the main flow characteristics
and the velocity levels in the occupied zone showed reasonable

Abstract: Natural ventilation systems assisted by passive stacks
are currently designed without incorporating heat recovery leading
to wasteful heat loss. Heat recovery is not used because the pressure
loss caused by a conventional heat exchanger is large and could
cause the ventilation system to fail. The heat pipe promises higher
capacity because it has much higher thermal conductance than conventional
heat exchangers. Individual heat pipes can be independently located
in ventilation stacks, making it easier to achieve lower pressure
drops. Experimental results show that for a heat recovery efficiency
of 50% and stack flow speed of 0.5 m/s, the pressure loss across
an existing type of heat-pipe assembly is about 1 Pascal. Computer
simulation of pressure and flow loss caused by heat-pipes was
carried out using computational fluid dynamics. It has been shown
that heat-pipes located at the bottom of the stack produce greater
insertion flow loss (IFL) than those located at the top and heat
pipes next to the stack walls give rise to less IFL than those
in the centre. Furthermore, it has been shown that the IFL is
the preferred indicator. The temperature of the heat pipe has
little effect on flow loss performance of the heat exchangers.

Abstract: Flow over and around a building is computed using the
F3Dke model, which is based on the k-e turbulence model. The convection
term is approximated using the hybrid upwind (HU) and the streamline
upwind (SU) procedures. Fine and coarse grids are considered to
study flow features and pressure coefficients. Flow separation
on the roof and sides of the building is captured using the fine
grid but not the coarse grid and the HU and SU procedures. The
computed flow features over a two-dimensional building using the
SU procedure are similar to the wind-tunnel model prediction.
The computed pressure coefficients using coarse and fine grids
are almost the same for two-and three dimensional buildings. The
computed pressure coefficients around a building at a university
compare well with field measurements.

Abstract: The two-layer methods combining the k-e model in the
external, fully turbulent flow region with either the one-equation
model or the low-Reynolds-number modified k-e model in the near-wall
area have been tested in computing the wind conditions around
a cubic building. Results were compared with those from the k-e
model computation as well as those from the experiments. Comparison
shows that neither the k-e model approach nor the modified k-e
model-based two-layer method can represent the flow separation
above the roof surface and near the side walls. The one-equation
model based on the two-layer approach, however, is effective in
predicting the separation. The numerical prediction of the wind
induced pressure n building surfaces, especially on the roof and
side walls, is also improved as compared with the other two methods.

Abstract: Two new tools have been developed for the analysis of
wind effects on both ventilation systems and building constructions.
They make possible the optimisation of an investment in natural
ventilation systems; mechanical ventilation system performance
and the type of building construction. Up till recently, lack
of knowledge and poor estimations of difficult to predict wind
effects have often led to ventilation systems with no optimal
performance and to poor building design in relation to wind hinder
and wind load. This increases ventilation costs. Measures to reduce
wind problems on buildings afterwards are often not fully effective,
while costs are much higher compared to measures taken in the
design stage. Present analysis tools, like wind tunnel tests and
computer model studies, and considered relatively expensive and
not well fitted to serve designers' needs. The two new tools have
overcome these disadvantages and costs are reduced to about 10%.
Data input and output are easy to handle by users with little
experience.

Abstract: The sensitivity of energy performance of office buildings

for the study of building energy performance are explained. The
DOE-2 building energy simulation program is used on a generic
model of an office building to generate data for the study. Important
input design parameters are identified and analysed from points
of view of annual building energy consumption. peak design loads
and building load profiles. It is believed that sensitivity techniques
are useful for assessing thermal responses of buildings and data
variability in building energy simulation. However, the results
should be interpreted in context with clear understanding of the

Abstract: Contains a final synthesis of the simulation exercises
on the Collins building, consisting of the thermal simulation
of a commercial building coupled with a VAV conditioning system,
performed within the IEA - Annex XVII research project (Building
Energy Management Systems). The main goal of Annex XVII was to
analyse and to develop methodologies and tools that could be used
to evaluate 'building energy management systems' (BEMS). One of
the Annex XVII activities consisted of utilizing procedures of
numerical simulation to evaluate the control strategies usually
implemented in BEMS. The main concern was not only the potential
energy savings, but also thermo-igrometric comfort performances
of HVAC systems. The system chosen for the simulation exercises
dealing with conditioning applications was the 'Collins building'.
It is a multistorey commercial building in Glasgow, Scotland,
that was already analysed and simulated during previous IEA research
projects (Annex IV and Annex X). The simulation activity started
with common exercises (ex. 1,2) aimed at defining a reference
case and testing existing simulation codes. This activity continued
with diversified exercises (ex. 3,4) aimed at the implementation
and evaluation of different control strategies. Most of the participant
countries used TRNSYS code to run the simulation exercises. For
this reason, a reference library of TRNSYS subroutines (TRNSYS
types) and a reference input file (TRNSYS deck) were developed.
The report is divided into three sections: The first section contains
a synthesis of the last common simulation exercise (Ex. 2). The
second section contains some synthesis reports on case studies
developed by different participants. The third section contains
the listings of the TRNSYS deck and the TRNSYS types utilised
for the simulation exercises, contained in a separate appendix.

Abstract: This paper presents the development of a three-dimensional
mathematical model to compute heat transfer within a radiantly
heated or cooled room, which then calculates the mass-averaged
room air temperature and the wall surface temperature distributions.
The radiation formulation used in the model accommodates arbitrary
placement of walls and objects within the room. The convection
model utilizes Nusselt number correlations published in the open
literature. The complete energy transfer model is validated by
comparing calculated room temperatures to temperatures measured
in a radiantly heated room. This three-dimensional model may be
applied to a building to assist the heating/cooling system design
engineer in sizing a radiant heating/cooling system. By coupling
this model with a thermal comfort model, the comfort levels throughout
the room can be easily and efficiently mapped for a given radiant
heater/cooler location. In addition, obstacles such as airplanes,
trucks, furniture, and partitions can be easily incorporated to
determine their effect on the radiant heating system performance.

Abstract: The thermal comfort and buoyancy-induced motion of air
in a room are determined by the interaction of different types
of heat transfer and of thermal storage in building components.
Heat transfer includes energy transport by radiation, convection,
and conduction (within air and the building fabric). The driving
forces of buoyancy of air become more pronounced for tall spaces.
Therefore, proper modeling of these interactions becomes more
crucial in the design of large enclosures. In atria, in particular,
solar and infrared radiation are important because of large-area
glazing. The boundary conditions for airflow, surface-to-surface
radiation, and building dynamics are linked by surface temperatures
that may vary in time and space. Numerical methods for the direct
coupling of computational fluid dynamics with thermal dynamics
and radiation are proposed and demonstrated at a case study building
of IEA Annex 26.

Abstract: Flow and temperature distributions in an atrium with
a tall ceiling height (H = 130m) are analyzed by means of computational
fluid dynamics (CFD) and radiation simulation. The occupied region
(the space near the floor) of the atrium, which is open to a large
void space, is partially air conditioned. The effects of the flow
and temperature fields of the void space on the occupied region
are analyzed in detail. Then the effects of ventilation in the
upper space of the atrium on the temperature distribution are
examined. The analyzed void space, 130 m high, is sandwiched between
two high-rise office buildings. The west and east sides are covered
with glass walls, through which much solar heat is introduced
into the void space. In summer, only the lowest portion of the
atrium is well air-conditioned, and the rest of the space, especially
the upper part, is heated by the sunshine and becomes hot. The
atrium has open bridges at every floor to connect the two office
buildings, so the flow and temperature around these bridges are
greatly affected by the atrium air. The analysis includes solar
radiation (shortwave) simulation, radiative heat transfer (infrared)
simulation, heat conduction simulation, and airflow and temperature
distribution analysis of the atrium space (CFD analysis). Ventilating
the upper space effectively limits the temperature rise in the
upper part of the atrium to within an acceptable level. The radiation
and convection simulations clearly show the characteristics of
the flow and temperature fields of the large-scale atrium.

Abstract: This paper investigates air movements and temperature

An existing environmental chamber with a volume of approximately

positions on the wall. Measurements of air temperature and velocity
are carried out in the environmental chamber at different heights
and positions in the chamber. The internal wall surface temperatures
and outside air temperature are also monitored. The mean air velocity
is measured at the same points as the air temperatures using omnidirectional
anemometers. The outputs from the anemometers are fed into microcomputer;
these data are analysed for comfort using the predicted percentage
of dissatisfaction (PPD) method of Fanger's thermal comfort criterion.

Abstract: Vertical temperature differences tend to be great in
a large indoor space such as an atrium, and it is important to
predict variations of vertical temperature distribution in the
early stage of the design. The authors previously developed and
reported on a new simplified unsteady-state calculation model
for predicting vertical temperature distribution in a large space.
Comparisons between calculated values and the results of test
chamber experiments verified that the model can be used to make
accurate predictions for conditions of no solar radiation. In
this paper, this model is applied to predicting the vertical temperature
distribution in an existing low-rise atrium that has a skylight
and is affected by transmitted solar radiation. Detailed calculation
procedures that use the model are presented with all the boundary
conditions, and analytical simulations are carried out for the
cooling condition. Calculated values are compared with measured
results. The results of the comparison demonstrate that the calculation
model can be applied to the design of a large space. The effects
of occupied-zone cooling are also discussed and compared with
those of all-zone cooling.

Abstract: The climate in a glazed space and the energy requirement
in it are greatly affected by the outside climate, particularly
by solar radiation. When calculations are made for a glazed space,
solar radiation must therefore by treated considerably more fully
than for a conventional building with windows of normal size.
In order that the proportion of solar radiation utilized in different
types of glazed spaces may be assessed, calculations have been
made with the computer program DEROB-LTH. The calculations demonstrate
that the type of glazing, the transmissivity of the glass, and
the absorptivity of the surfaces inside the glazed space (i.e..
the dark and light surfaces) have a great significance for the
proportion of transmitted solar radiation retained inside the
glazed space. On the other hand, the geographical location of
the glazed space in Sweden, its orientation, and the time of year
are of less importance. The proportion of transmitted solar radiation
retained in the glazed space may vary between about 30% and 90%.
A simple manual calculation method has been developed for the
assessment of the temperature and energy requirement in glazed
spaces. The effect of the glazed space on the energy requirements
of surrounding buildings can also be estimated. It is intended
that this calculation method be used as early as possible during
the preliminary design stage so that an idea may be gained of
the difference between alternative designs.

Abstract: This paper presents the combination of a linear temperature
stratification model and the use of ISO 7730 for calculating thermal
comfort. Measurements have shown that close to linear temperature
profiles are common in atria, mainly due to large hot and cold
surfaces. the presented stratification model is integrated into
a dynamic single-zone energy simulation program. Based on the
stratified air temperature and calculated surface temperatures
of an atrium, thermal comfort is calculated for five location.
Results are presented as hourly and accumulated curves, and hourly
data are compared to measurements. The simulations show some deviations
from measured values, as expected for the simplified approaches,
and the results are analyzed to locate the main sources of errors.
In spite of the less accurate results, tools like this are of
great value in design and retrofit processes because of their
wide availability and simple use. When used carefully, expensive
redesign may be avoided at an early stage.

Abstract: This paper describes a general principle for accurate
calculation of the effect of shading objects on surfaces exposed
to direct solar radiation. The principle used is known as 'polygon
clipping', a technique for determining every subpolygon that arises
when two or more polygons overlap one another. In this case, the
obstructing objects are approximated by polygons in space, projected
as seen from the sun, at any given time of the year, onto the
exposed surface of interest, so that every sunlit region and the
fully or partly shaded regions of the plane surface can be determined.
The technique has been implemented in a PC software application,
which can function as a stand-along design tool or may be integrated
with programs for thermal simulation of buildings or solar systems.
The paper gives examples of the use of application, shows its
functionality when integrated with a thermal simulation tool,
and presents comparative validations against the standard ASHRAE
algorithms for calculations of overhangs and side fins.

Abstract: This paper highlights the factors that should be considered
when applying computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to atrium design,
and gives practical recommendations on how to achieve accurate
results. CFD is an ideal tool for indoor airflow prediction, and
so can play an important role in energy-conscious heating, ventilating,
and air-conditioning (HVAC) design. Solar radiation and heat loss
or gain through the glazed envelope of an atrium have a major
bearing on the quality of the indoor environment. The paper therefore
focuses on these aspects of atrium modeling. It first reviews
established CFD methods of relevance to atrium design, such as
using CFD results to evaluate thermal comfort and ventilation
efficiency, and modeling boundary conditions for flow and heat
transfer. Further, new results are presented from the authors'
investigations into different ways of modeling solar radiation,
ways of defining boundary conditions for wall heat transfer, the
effect of near wall grid resolution, and the effect of including
surface-to-surface radiation exchange. A CFD code with a conventional
k-e turbulence model was used in the study.

Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, June 1992, 55pp. The
project consisted of design development, construction, and follow-up
testing and inspection of ten typical single-family house basements
in Southern Ontario. One non-typical house was also investigated.
A range of builders participated in the project constructing houses
and commenting on their experiences. This is a final report consisting
of results from the construction phase and the soak test phase.
Of the schemes tested, six were insulated from the exterior, four
from the interior, and the additional house had an insulating
block wall scheme. General findings from the construction phase
were that interior insulation schemes were favoured over exterior
ones, but that both systems have different detailing problems
for which training is required to resolve. Rigid glass fibre insulation
was found to be easier to apply to exterior walls with commonly-found
irregularities than were rigid polystyrene materials. Panelized
above-grade insulation protection products offer some advantages
over site applied ones, but they tend to be difficult to adapt
for residential use. Composite geotextiles wall drainage panels
and ledge blocks require further development to improve their
applicability to residential construction. Other basement design
configurations (ie. modifications to the methods tried) may solve
some of the problems encountered by builders in this project.
The soak testing indicated that for the basement systems demonstrated
and the soil conditions at these sites, the moisture handling
methods were generally successful in limiting leakage problems.
Soil conditions on the test sites provided fair to good drainage.
Care must be taken to avoid gaps with the drainage of insulation
materials and finish detailing where moisture ingress can be concentrated.
It is evident that builders and trades persons require more technical
information and experience on the use of materials where moisture
handling is important.

Abstract: Glazed facades may cause thermal discomfort due to downdraft.
Convectors placed close to the facade can prevent downdraft but
can cause an increase in the energy consumption. The objective
of this research was to investigate whether the structural system
of a glazed facade can be used to reduce downdraft and avoid thermal
comfort problems in the occupied zone. The effect of large obstacles
on a cold boundary layer flow was investigated for different temperature
differences between the obstacles, and different sizes of the
obstacles. The effect of the obstacles was dependent on the characteristics
of the flow and the sizes of the obstacles. With turbulent flow
and an obstacle larger than the boundary layer thickness, the
flow separated from the surface and a new boundary layer was established
below the obstacle. The risk of thermal discomfort due to downdraft
was reduced considerably.

Abstract: A simplified ground heat loss calculation method for
slab-on-grade floors and basements is developed. The method is
based on the results from the ITPE method and is suitable for
seasonal heat loss calculation. The simplified method consists
of a set of equations for estimating the monthly total heat flow
between a building and the ground as a function of a wide range
of variables such as building dimensions, insulation configurations,
and soil thermal properties. The equations are designed to accept
continuously variable input values. The simplified method predictions
are tested against Mitalas's and ITPE results. The agreement between
the correlations and the ITPE method is found to be within 10%
for the annual mean, amplitude, and phase angle of total building
heat loss.

Abstract: Describes how field testing found that uncontrolled
air flows and building depressurisation are widespread in a sample
of eight Florida commercial buildings. These eight buildings experienced
substantial depressurisation under normal operation. In tight
buildings, only a small imbalance of air flow can produce serious
depressurisation problems. In very leaky buildings, large air
flow imbalances may produce only moderate depressurisation. The
problems caused by depressurisation in these buildings include
high humidity levels, mould and mildew growth on wall surfaces
and in building cavities, moisture damage to building materials,
extinguished pilot lights, combustion equipment backdrafting,
flame roll-out, sewer gas entering the building, and doors being
difficult to open.

Abstract: Designers are being encouraged towards passive cooling
and natural ventilation in buildings. This will promote heavyweight
buildings which utilise both fabric thermal storage and night
venting techniques.In terms of energy consumption and carbon dioxide
emissions, the new build sector is of relatively minor importance
compared with the existing stock of high energy consumption buildings,
many of which already contain air conditioning. This paper described
a new technique whereby new and existing buildings can be fitted
with a low energy air movement system, which significantly increases
the fabric thermal storage capacity of the building. This should
eliminate the need for air conditioning whilst still enabling
occupants to remain comfortable in summer.

Abstract: Outdoor air quality has generally improved in the UK
over the last 2 decades but during this period changing conditions
within the home have tended to reduce ventilation and increase
the opportunity for accumulation of undesirable levels of indoor
air pollutants. Information obtained from laboratory and epidemiological
studies suggests that indoor air pollutants are an important cause
of avoidable morbidity and mortality in the UK. This paper reviews
the major indoor air pollutants of concern in the UK and considers
some of the special issues relevant to indoor environment.

Abstract: Indoor air quality (IAQ) was assessed in homes in an
experimental community of single-family dwellings that had been
built with materials chosen for low pollutant emission and other
modified design features to provide enhanced residential indoor
air quality. The IAQ was measured in six of these experimental
homes and also in three conventionally built homes of similar
size and price range. The IAQ was assessed shortly after construction
before the houses were occupied and again after each of the houses
had been occupied for five months. Before occupancy, there were
higher levels of airborne particles and of some volatile organic
compounds in the conventional homes than in the experimental homes.
During occupancy, benzene, ethylbenzene, m- and p-xylene, and
o-xylene were all higher in the conventional homes, but dichloromethane,
Freon 11, and trichlorethylene were higher in the experimental
homes. In the conventional homes, mean levels of benzene and chloroform
increased, whereas methylchloroform and toluene levels decreased
from preoccupancy to occupancy. In the experimental homes, dichloromethane
increased, and m-and p-xylene and o-xylene decreased from preoccupancy
to occupancy. The results suggest that attached garages, geographical
siting, and occupants' activities substantially influenced the
IAQ in these homes. The enhanced indoor air quality homes tested
in this study were judged to be a least partially effective, with
the most obvious sustained IAQ benefits being related to the lack
of an attached garage.

Abstract: Ventilation design for underground car parks is studied,
first through a brief review of the ventilation requirement. Carbon
monoxide concentration is believed to be the most important chemical
species to be considered. Some results on field measurement of
underground car parks reported in the literature are reviewed.
The well-mixed model, which is a basic design model for studying
the transient variation of carbon monoxide concentration, is described.
The model is then revised to describe multiple sources of emission
for several cars staying in a carpark with their internal combustion
engines operating. Two mixing models proposed by Sandbert 1981)-Model
1, based on a displacement ventilation system and Model 3, based
on a ventilation system with a short-circuiting air flow path-are
applied to study the ventilation design in car parks. The technique
of computational fluid dynamics is used to verify those existing
models and then to compute the mixing factors concerned. Key system
performance parameters are calculated, and a set of graphs relating
those system performance parameters with the input design data
is presented. These graphs can be used for designing the required
ventilation rate for the system under different carbon monoxide
loads. Eight local car parks are surveyed to illustrate the application
of the model. Field measurement data on underground car parks,
as described above, are reviewed and applied to justify the mixing
models.

Abstract: Particle size distribution is important to characterize
airborne dust and to design particulate matter control strategies.
New data are needed on particle size distribution in swine buildings,
and the existing particle size distribution models need to be
evaluated. The log-normal, power law, and Weibull models did not
adequately describe the particle size distribution of dust samples
collected in rooms housing pigs. An alternative two-parameter
empirical model was developed that fit the data much more closely
than the other models. The parameters of the particle size distribution
function did not vary significantly among rooms housing pigs in
different stages of production, suggesting that similar dust control
strategies may be developed for a wide variety of pig housing
facilities.

Abstract: Sprinkling a small amount of mineral oil onto the floor
area in a livestock building has been demonstrated as an effective
method to reduce dust concentration. The objective of this study
was to evaluate mechanical properties of different types of oils
sprinkled at different temperatures and pressures. Six biological
oils (purified canola, crude canola, corn, sunflower, flax, and
soybean) and one mineral oil (baby oil) were evaluated at temperatures
between 10 and 40oC (50 and 104oF). Density and viscosity of the
oils were measured using a viscometer. Sprinkleability in terms
of droplet diameter and uniformity was measured under different
pressures using a computer image processing system and a microscope.
Oil mist at the animal and human breathing levels (0.1, 0.8, and
1.6 m [0.33, 2.62, and 5.25 ft] above floor) were examined during,
and 10 seconds after, oil sprinkling. Proper oil sprinkling should
be carried out at a pressure and temperature that produces oil
droplets smaller than an upper threshold diameter (UTD) to ensure
good sprinkleability, but larger than a lower threshold diameter
(LTD) to avoid producing oil mist. Optimum range of temperature
and pressure for each type of oil are recommended.

Abstract: The problems of developing countries are often very
different to those of the industrialised regions of the world.
The impact of VOC pollution in large cities in developing countries
has not been adequately considered. Many of these cities have
rapidly growing numbers of motor vehicles in climates that promote
the formation of photochemical smog. The health implications of
this, together with the cancer risks associated with several VOCs
have not yet been properly evaluated. The levels of a variety
of volatile organic compounds (VOC) were measured in several cities
in Asia;Bangkok, Manila and Beijing, and in South America, Sao
Paulo, Santiago and Caracas. Preliminary results of studies in
these countries have indicated that VOC levels are higher than
normally encountered in European counties and that indoor levels
are not significantly different to those outdoors. It is likely
that the majority of VOCs measured indoors and outdoors are attributable
to motor vehicles, although the results of samples currently being
analysed will enable a more detailed analysis to be given.

in the indoor and outdoor air in six office buildings, along with
the measurement of other chemical, sensory and physical parameters.
The number of VOCs found in each building was higher than sixty.
The most abundant VOCs were aliphatic and aromatic compounds.
The VOCs detected in the outdoor air show a strong relation to
the traffic existing in the nearby area. Correlation of the concentrations
found in the indoor and outdoor air shows that the outdoor air
contributes significantly to the chemical pollution of the indoor
air in some of the buildings. The dominant indoor sources emitting
VOCs were permanent ones such as building materials and furniture.

Abstract: As the indoor air quality industry has grown, there
have been a number of new technologies that have burst upon the
marketplace. One of these technologies often called 'Air Quality'
or 'Volatile Organic Compound Sensors' (VOC) sensors have generated
great interest as a possible approach to control air quality in
all types of buildings. This section provides an overview of CO2
and air quality sensors and outlines the best application for
both types of technology. While both sensor technologies can be
useful in indoor air quality control they are not interchangeable.
Each has its own application.

Abstract: The objective of the study was to assess the actual
ventilation and indoor air quality in the Finnish building stock
(dwellings and day-care centers) with special reference to the
existing guideline values. Furthermore, the objective was to evaluate
the occurrence of symptoms and perceptions among occupants (adult
residents, children, workers) in relation to ventilation system,
ventilation rate and dampness. The study population in studies
I and III consisted of 242 dwellings with 473 adult residents
in the Helsinki metropolitan area. In study V, the study population
consisted of a random sample of 2,568 pre-school children living
in the city of Espoo, part of the Helsinki metropolitan area.
In studies II, IV and VI, the study population consisted of a
random sample of 30 day-care centers and their 268 female workers
in Espoo. The measurements of ventilation and indoor air quality
in the dwellings and day-care centers included ventilation rate,
CO2 concentration, and temperature and humidity. Self- and parent-administered
questionnaires were distributed to the occupants inquiring their
personal characteristics, occurrence of symptoms of interest,
perceived indoor air quality and details of their home and work
environments. The results indicate that there is much room for
improvement in the ventilation and indoor air quality of Finnish
dwellings and day-care centers. The control of ventilation, temperature
and humidity and the prevention of water damage are important
issues on which to concentrate in the future. There is need to
improve the quality in all phases of construction:design, installation,
adjustment, operation, and maintenance.

Abstract: The Swedish Council for Building Research explains that
good energy performance does not affect indoor air quality. An
airtight and well-insulated building will, in fact, allow a better
indoor climate by minimizing draughts and by facilitating control

Abstract: We ventilate buildings to create comfortable and healthy
indoor conditions. For comfort ventilation, indoor spaces must
receive a sufficient quantity of outdoor air tempered to satisfy
thermal comfort needs, and a sufficient quantity of clean air
to create acceptable indoor air quality. Comfort ventilation is
assessed by measuring occupant perceptions of indoor air quality,
including their assessments of odors, thermal conditions, and
ventilation adequacy. For health ventilation, indoor spaces must
receive air that is free from hazardous chemical or microbiological
contaminants. Health ventilation is measured by comparing levels
of indoor air pollutants against threshold limit values (TLVs)
or permissible exposure levels (PELs) for those pollutants.

Abstract: The term&quot;healthy building&quot;, has been popularized
in recent years as a response to the previously popular term,
'sick building'. It is difficult to define healthy buildings or
to establish criteria for classifying buildings as healthy without
referring to the presence or absence of problems, occupant complaints,
and illnesses. In practice, we generally define 'sick buildings'
by the prevalence rates of occupant health, and comfort problems.
The complexity of modern buildings, the diversity of actors involved
and processes for making them, and the importance of building
environments for people in modern western societies present large
challenges to those who would create healthy buildings. A new
paradigm is needed to understand buildings, how they become unhealthy,
and how to keep them from becoming 'sick'. 'Building ecology'
is a conceptual framework for understanding buildings and creating
healthy ones. Practical steps are recommended to develop a more
complete theoretical framework and application principles. A few
criteria for healthy buildings can serve as examples for the development
of a more complete set.

Abstract: During the last decade, the concepts of 'sick' and 'healthy'
buildings have been introduced and debated at regional, national
and international conferences. Although these concepts have helped
the research community to focus on the integration of health and
building sciences, they have also caused controversy, especially
among those who are responsible for the financing, design, construction,
and operations of buildings and their systems. In this address,
three national or multi-national studies now being conducted in
Europe, North America, and Japan are described and compared to
previously reported studies with regard to their characterizations
of the health of the existing building stock. The concepts of
Continuous Degradation and Continuous Accountability are the described,
followed by an overview of evolving diagnostic procedures and
evaluation criteria. These trends and concepts are then considered
through lessons learned in practice, including: the validity of
Continuation Degradation; the practicality of Continuous Accountability;
the need for rational evaluation criteria; the effectiveness of
diagnostic procedures, and need to document the benefits of Healthy
Buildings.

Abstract: The main reason for the interest of the environmental
impact of indoor air is the concerns for human health. There is
also another reason which addresses the sick building syndrome.
The article deals with exposure of the population inside building
constructions. Inhabitants may be exposed in principle, to several
types of agents. At first it is chemical pollutants. Sulphur and
nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, ozone and radon are indoor air
pollutants studied in detail. Two components of building indoor
environment have been taken into account so far. It is thermal
comfort and indoor air quality. This seems to be insufficient
at present. Especially indoor air quality needs to be specified.

Abstract: The appropriate specific short term technical fixes
for a facility with Indoor Air Quality concerns will always be
based on HVAC system limitations, any ability to eliminate or
reduce pollutant sources, associated health risks, and the budgets
that can be identified for corrective actions. Decreasing the
likelihood of any facility to have Indoor Quality problems must
begin with sound conceptual building system designs and include
a cost effective easy to maintain HVAC system. With detailed design
and construction work we are confident that a good quality, low
maintenance, central ventilation system can be installed in most
schools within the project budget. Unit ventilators may have a
lower first cost but their life cycle costs will be far more than
central systems taking energy and maintenance into consideration
over the 30 year life span of a typical school project. Additionally,
unit ventilators will never deliver the high quality indoor environment
that is possible with a well designed and operated centralized
system be it displacement or conventional. Finally, the concepts
utilized in the design of a vertical displacement ventilation
system for high density human occupied spaces are very similar
to the concepts utilized for the design of an industrial application.
We look forward to the opportunity to move the concept to both
other climatic regions and an industrial application, ad the situation
may arise.

Abstract: There is little data available on the concentration
of volatile organic compounds is dwellings and office buildings
in the Czech Republic. There is data on formaldehyde concentrations
in buildings but it is mostly collected from buildings where people
have complained about the quality of indoor air, especially when
it is known that the building materials or furnishings may contain
formaldehyde. Since the complaints of occupants of a building
are generally non-specific, it is sometimes very difficult to
guess what is the main problem in the building. When it is suggested
that the problem could be due to something familiar and various
possibilities, for example dry air or volatile organic compounds,
are put forward these suggestions are often accepted. Probably
because they are familiar and understood by the occupants. We
have made some measurements of volatile organic compounds (VOC)
in non-industrial and non-occupational environments. People were
asked about any problem they had with the environment. Most often
they replied that the problems were of annoyance or unpleasant
smells. A common complaint is dryness of mucous membranes. This
problem is not dangerous from the point of view of people's health
but does concern their quality of life. For people with chronic
respiratory disease, including allergies, such irritation of the
mucous membrane, or skin, could worsen their condition. The low
concentrations of VOC's and formaldehyde that we found indoors
in non-industrial environment are probably not dangerous, but
can reduce the quality of life for the people in the buildings.
The quality of life if said to have some connection with the immune
system. From that point of view even the low concentration of
chemical compounds indoors can affect people.

Abstract: Exposure to VOCs present in the air we breathe may have
effects on people's health and well-being. Exposure in our homes
can make a significant contribution to our total exposure to VOCs.
To investigate the factors determining the concentration of VOCs
and formaldehyde in homes, diffusive sampling techniques have
been used to monitor the indoor air in five UK homes and one outdoor
location over a three year period. The main total volatile organic
compound (TVOC) concentration recorded indoors was 200 ug m3 and
this was six times higher than the outdoor concentration. The
relative amounts of individual compounds recorded indoors and
outdoors varied depending on the relative importance of indoor
and outdoor sources for each compound. Differences in concentrations
detected between rooms in the same home indicate that an individual's
exposure to formaldehyde and VOCs will be influenced by the time
spent in different rooms of the home. There was significant variation
in the concentrations of formaldehyde and VOCs over time. For
formaldehyde seasonal effects were found to dominate, with higher
concentrations being recorded in summer than in winter, whilst
for other VOCs occupant activities were more important. For example,
higher concentrations of TVOCs and undecane were found to relate
to greater amounts of painting in the home.

Abstract: The last decade has seen the publication of an increasing
number of scientific papers in which lung tumours have been induced
in rats following chronic exposure by inhalation to a range of
insoluble, respiratory-sized particulate dusts which hitherto
have been considered to be biologically inert. Such substances
include talc, titanium dioxide, volcanic ash and carbon black.
Such particles have generally been considered 'nuisance dusts',
possibly capable of eliciting fibrogenic changes, but not cancer.
The one feature that all these studies in rats have in common
is that the experimental exposures induced 'over-loading' of the
lung as evidenced by an increase in lung weight, retention of
particles and chronic and marked inflammatory changes. All of
this was preceded by an underlying 'overloading' of the alveolar
macrophages to the point where they stopped removing particles
from the lung. This can happen in a number of experimental species,
but it is only the rat that appears to respond with lung tumours
as an additional pathological response. This points to the lung
tumours being a rat-specific response and thus not a very useful
end-point for human risk evaluation for such biologically inert
particles. In support of this view is the remarkable observation
that in the one well-studied occupational group that routinely
has 'particle overload; in the lungs, namely coal miners, there
is no evidence that they experience an excess risk of lung cancer.

Abstract: Exposure to organic dust components was studied in four
potato processing plants because preliminary results showed high
exposures accompanied by work-related health complaints. Ambient
air concentrations of inhalable dust ranged from below 0.4 up
to 44mg m-3 [geometric mean (GM) 0.64 mg m-3}. Respirable dust
concentrations were considerable lower. Personal concentrations
of inhalable dust were somewhat higher, and strongly related to
a few working tasks dealing with dried starch or protein. Ambient
air concentrations of endotoxin ranged from 0.5 to more than 60,000
endotoxin units (EU) per m3 for the inhalable size fraction (GM
+ 280 EUm-3). For the respirable size fraction, endotoxin concentrations
were lower (about the same factor as for dust). Personal endotoxin
concentrations were lower than ambient air concentrations, probably
because workers did not work the whole period of the shift near
endotoxin sources. Endotoxin exposure was evaluated as very high;23%
of the workers had a mean exposure above 1000EUm-3 (100ng m-3).
Differences between plants had a large influence on both dust
and endotoxin exposure. A fairly good correlation was found between
counts of airborne gram-negative bacteria and airborne endotoxin
of the respirable size fraction. Ambient air levels of bacteria
and endotoxin were strongly related to process water temperature,
suggesting that exposure reduction can be achieved by lowering
this temperature or by other measures that inhibit bacterial growth.
We conclude that recycling of process water probably constitutes
an exposure source of bacteria and endotoxin in many facilities.

Abstract: Dust in animal buildings should be controlled to levels
that affect health only minimally. Dust control strategies include
reducing the rate of emission (source control), effective ventilation
(ventilation control), and air cleaning (removal control). Source
control strategies include use of feed additives, cleaning dusty
surfaces and spraying water or oil over dusty surfaces. Ventilation
control includes purge ventilation and effective room air distribution.
Air cleaning strategies involve filtration, electrostatic precipitation,
or wet scrubbing. Promising techniques for livestock buildings
include the use of additives, oil or water spraying, purge ventilation
and effective room air distribution. Technical and economic constraints
have prevented these methods from being widely practiced. Effective
and economically feasible dust control methods should be developed
and systematically tested under both controlled laboratory and
field conditions. Other research and development needs include:
1) characterization of dust particles, dust sources and sinks;
and 2) development of sensors and control devices that incorporate
the dust control technology into the environmental control system.

Abstract: A registry-based case control study, involving 120 cases
(28 males, 92 females) of lung cancer deaths, was conducted in
1985 in the city of Guangzhou to investigate whether lifestyle
factors are associated with an increased incidence of lung cancer
in never-smoking individuals. The cases were matched with two
control groups which consisted of non-respiratory-disease-related
deaths or non-respiratory-related cancer deaths. Lifestyle factors
assessed in the study include: personal history of nonmalignant
respiratory diseases, practice of fresh vegetable consumption,
lifetime occupation and occupational exposure histories, exposure
to ETS, degree of indoor air pollution, general conditions of
home residence, cooking practices and environments, and family
history of cancer. Conditional logistic regression analysis demonstrated
a negative association between fresh vegetable consumption and
lung cancer risk in both sexes, suggesting that vegetables may
exert a 'protective' effect against lung cancer in humans. In
males, elevated risks were found between lung cancer and occupational
exposure. In females, indoor air pollution and kitchen environment
were associated with risk of lung cancer. No statistically significant
association was observed between lung cancer and all other factors
examined, including exposure to ETS. A second case-control, study
was performed in 1986 to investigate the possible association
between spousal smoking and lung cancer deaths. Cases consisted
of 75 never-smoking females and the two control groups consisted
of 126 cases of deaths due to tumors except lung cancer. When
cases were matched against&quot;death-unrelated-to-tumor&quot;
controls, the odds ration [OR] for ETS exposure was 1.19, as gauged
by whether or not there was ETS exposure;0.72 and 1.62, when ETS
was assessed based on exposure to less than 20 or to 20 or more
cigarettes/day. When ETS exposure was measured by 'smoking years'.

Abstract: The increased use of water-based paints (WBP) has changed
exposure conditions for Swedish house painters but few exposure
measurements have been made during the indoor application of WBP.
The main aim of this study was to identify and quantify exposure,
particularly to volatile organic compounds (VOC)during the indoor
application of water-based paint. A secondary aim was to evaluate
the efficacy of different sampling absorbents for the measurement
of the major VOCs emitted from WBP. Exposure measurements of VOCs
formaldehyde, ammonia, dust and metals were performed by personal
sampling during the indoor application of WBPs commonly used in
Sweden, VOCs were sampled on different sorbents, and were analysed
by gas chromatography with a mass selective detector. The desorbtion
efficiency of different sorbents was also determined and XAD-7
was found to be the most appropriate for glycols and glycol ethers.
Exposure to VOCs formaldehyde, ammonia and metals was low, compared
with current Swedish permissible exposure limit values (PEL) but
dust exposures were found in excess of the PEL of 10mg m-3. A
large proportion of the VOCs consisted of propyleneglycol (PG),
diglycol ethers, Texano (2,2,4-trimethyl 1,3-pentanediol monoiso-butyrate),
and iso-butanol. The introduction of water-based paints has improved
the work environment for most house painters by reducing the total
VOC exposure, but VOC exposure has now shifted towards compounds
which are more polar and which have higher boiling points.

Abstract: There is a growing concern about indoor air quality
(IAQ) in schools, We have studied relations between subjective
indoor air quality (SIAQ) and measured IAQ among school personnel
(N=97) in six mid-Swedish primary schools. Information on SIAQ
and the psychosocial work environment was measured by a self-administered
questionnaire, using analogue rating scales. Indoor exposures
were quantified by hygienic measurements. Perception of high room
temperature was related to a poor climate of cooperation, fleecy
wall materials, and the concentration of volatile organic compounds
(VOC), including xylene, limonene, and butanols. Perception of
air dryness was related to atopy, work stress, poor climate of
cooperation, high room temperature, low air humidity, and high
VOC concentration,including, limonene, and n-alkanes. Perception
of dusty air was related to work stress, the role of schoolteacher,
and exposure to 2-ethyl-1-hexanol. No relations were found between
SIAQ and CO2. building age, or respirable dust. To achieve a good
SIAQ, room temperature should be kept at a maximum of 22oC, and
exposure to VOCs and fleecy materials should be minimized. Finally,
a sound psychosocial work climate is essential for the perception
of a good physical indoor climate.

Abstract: Numerous methods attempt to measure the combined concentrations
of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in indoor air as total VOCs
(TVOC). This paper reviews TVOC methods recently presented in
the literature and at an international conference on indoor air
quality, for the purpose of identifying common practices and of
assessing the impacts that choices of sample collection media
and analytical methods and instrumentation can have on TVOC results.
The paper also presents the results of laboratory and field comparisons
of three TVOC methods. These are a flame-ionization-detector (FID)
method, a gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) method,
and a method employing a photoacoustic infrared (IR) gas monitor.
The laboratory experiments were conducted with eight different
mixtures of VOCs. The FID method demonstrated an average accuracy
of 93+18per cent when the measured values were calculated as concentrations
of carbon. The FID and GC/MS methods demonstrated average accuracies
of 77+37 and 75+22 percent, respectively, when the measured hydrocarbon-equivalent
values were compared to the expected mass concentrations of the
mixtures. The higher uncertainty for the FID was largely due to
the low mass response of 27 percent for chlorinated compounds.
The response of the IR gas monitor varied between 6 and 560 percent
for different classes of compounds. Air samples from ten buildings
were analyzed by both the FID and GC/MS methods. The results were
highly correlated and similar, with the GC/MS values approximately
20 percent higher on average.

Abstract: A methodology has been developed for obtaining new exposure
metrics for complex mixtures of volatile organic compounds (VOCs).
Using this approach, it has been possible, for the first time,
to link sick building syndrome (SBS) irritancy symptoms to low
level exposures to VOCs. This new methodology should be useful
in efforts to determine the causes of SBS and eliminate this as
a barrier to energy efficient ventilation.

Abstract: The indoor radon level in terms of potential alpha energy
exposure (PAEE) has been measured in several dwellings of Aizawl
town (23.36N, 83.00E) situated in north-eastern India. Films of
LR-115 (type II) solid state nuclear track detector (SSNTD) were
used in bare mode in the present measurements. The PAEE values
in most of the dwellings are lower than the action level prescribed
by the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP-65).
The geometrical mean value of the PAEE from the present set of
measurements has been found to be 7.5 + 2.5mWL. It is further
observed that ventilation and type of building construction materials
have a considerable influence on the level of indoor radon.

Abstract: To assess the effectiveness of mitigative measures against
radon (222Rn) entry into houses, experiments were conducted in
crawl-space house where the dirt floor of the crawl space was
covered with sheets of 0.23 mm polethylene foil fixed to the walls.
The radon concentration was measured below the foil and in the
crawl space together with environmental variables such as indoor-outdoor
pressure differences. The sub-foil region was small compared with
the crawl space and in direct contact with the soil, and because
the influence of ventilation and radon emerging from building
materials was largely suppressed. The experimental data was analyzed
using various types of models including a simplistic mass-balance
model, a regression model, and a two-dimensional numerical model
based on Darcy flow of soil gas and combined diffusive and advective
transport of radon. The main outcome of the work was that :(i)
The soil-gas entry rate per Pascal depressurization was at the
order of 1 m3 h-1 corresponding to an effective soil permeability
of 5.10-10m2, (ii) the stack-related part of the depressurization
of the crawl space (approx. 0.1 PaoC-1)was controlled by the temperature
difference between the living room of the house and the outdoors
(not by the difference between the crawl space and the outdoors),
(iii) that part of the wind-related depressurization that was
measured by the pressure transducers seemed to force radon into
the crawl space in the same proportion as the stack-related part
of the depressurization, (iv) the ratio of advective and diffusive
entry was approx. 0.7, when the crawl space was depressurized
1.5 Pa,(v) the effective diffusivity of the foil was found to
be three orders of magnitude larger than that measured in the
laboratory (the enhanced diffusivity was most likely caused by
leaks in the foil and by mixing fans located in the crawl space),
and (vi) there was no measurable mitigative impact of having the
sheets of foil on the crawl-space floor even if the crawl space
was artificially pressurized or depressurized.

Abstract: Experiments were conducted in a crawl-space house where
the dirt crawl-space floor was covered by sheets of 0.23mm polythylene
foil fixed to the walls. Effective system parameters were identified
using a two-dimensional numerical model. The effective foil diffusivity
was found to be three orders of magnitude larger than the one
measured for the bulk material. Under natural conditions 2 to
3% of the total crawl-space ventilation flow seemed to come from
the soil. This flow accounted for 1/3 of the total radon entry
from the soil. The model was used to predict the effectiveness
of using different foils in combination with slight over- or underpressures
of the crawl space.

Abstract: Historic buildings often consist of uninsulated masonry
walls. Such structures have lasted well because the absence of
insulation and relatively low humidity levels of interior air
have kept the stone cladding warm and dry. The growing need for
controlled conditions inside the existing building have led to
an increase in typical levels of humidification, which presents
serious threats to the integrity and performance of traditional
wall construction. The dynamic buffer zone (DBZ) has been designed
to introduce an intentionally controlled space between the controlled
interior environment and the variable exterior environment. This
limits the migration of moisture-laden air from the interior into
the exterior masonry wall, thereby greatly increasing the potential
service life of such assemblies. Further benefits of the DBZ can
be derived by integrating the DBZ with the building's HVAC systems.
This paper describes the building physics issues, the DBZ system,
and outlines its application to a 60 year old building in Toronto.

Abstract: Heating ventilating and air conditioning duct insulation
in a building located in south Florida was removed because of
heavy fungal infestation of the building. Samples of these materials
were examined by direct microscopy and enrichment culture. Additional
insulation samples were desiccated for three weeks over silica
drying gel, weighed, then placed over saturated salt in water
solutions at known relative humidities. At relative humidities
approaching 95% some insulation samples on an average gained 6%
of their dry weight in water. The water gain at various relative
humidities ranged from a low of 2% to a high of 9.3% of the dry
weight. The hygroscopic nature of duct insulation and its capacity
to absorb or trap organic particulates or volatiles is most likely
a contributing factor in fungal colonization. The urea and formaldehyde
levels in some insulations may control which fungi colonize these
substrates. This paper also reviews efforts to made the face coating
of insulation more resistant to fungal colonization.

Abstract: Describes a case study which involves a nursery school

recommendations, the situation was improved. The structure in
question is a nursery school that occupies a large brick one-story
building in eastern Canada. The school is a nonprofit organisation,
and several parents had contributed to the design and construction
of the facility. Because of inadequate funds, part of the basement
remained unfinished. The building housed about 80 children and
staff members. The 6,000 square foot, one-year old building had
a concrete basement floor under one-half of the structure. The
other half of the basement was covered with sand, which became
humid due to lack of good drainage. The main retaining wall was
covered with gyproc going from the ceiling to the sandy floor.
There was no mechanical ventilation in the building, except for
washroom air exhausts. The building had openable windows, except
in the unfinished basement area, which had air vents and an outside
door.

Abstract: Past thermal comfort research has shown differences
in the thermal sensation votes given in field and laboratory settings.
However, such research tends to compare the votes of different
groups of people in different environments rather than comparing
the same people in each environment. Therefore, a two-phase study
was conducted of the thermal comfort of 30 BRE employees in their
home, in their office, and in a climate chamber. In the first
phase each subject spent two 3h sessions in each environment and
the temperature was adjusted between sessions within the range
18-26oC. Data loggers were used to record the air and mean radiant
temperature, air velocity and relative humidity; subjective ratings
of thermal sensation were obtained using questionnaires. The subjects
wore the same clothing in each session and were allowed to conduct
only sedentary activities. The reported thermal sensation votes
were compared with those predicted using ISO 7730. The observed
neutral temperatures for each of the three environments differed
by up to 2oC and were up to 1oC different to those predicted.
This finding has implications for energy use. In the second phase,
the subjects were studied in their home and office only. No restrictions
were imposed on clothing, previous or current activities, or environmental
conditions. The observed thermal sensation votes were very poorly
correlated with those predicted and with operative temperature.

Abstract: Acceptable thermal environmental conditions for healthy
people may be determined using thermal sensation votes and physiological
data, but, for laboratory animals, alternative methods are necessary.
Previous reports have shown that exposed body surfaces play an
important role in thermoregulation. The noninvasive procedure
of thermography does not disturb the natural behavior of the animals
but allows for the estimation of comfortable temperatures by measuring
changes in skin temperature. Using this procedure, it was observed
that tail skin temperatures of rats, mice, and house musk shrews
caged singly differed from individual animals of the same species
housed in groups. Also, a temperature gradient between the animal
cage and the climatic chamber was detected; the gradient was smaller
for singly caged animals than for groups. The data suggest that
comfortable temperatures for rats range from 26 to 27.5oC; 25
to 27oC for mice; and 23 to 25oC for house musk shrews.

Abstract: Detailed air turbulence characteristics in a full-scale
and running fan-filter unit type clean room (4.20m x 2.97m x 2.70m)
with and without a clean bench loaded are investigated experimentally.
The measurements of the three components of air velocity were
conducted by means of a three dimensional ultrasonic anemometer.
Velocity vectors, turbulence intensity, turbulence kinetic energy
and probability density functions of velocity direction and velocity
contours in the space domain are presented. The results show that
the non-uniformity and deflection angle of air velocity are within
13% and 7.9 degrees, respectively. Moreover, the mean flow patterns,
turbulence characteristics, and histogram features of the air
flow are discussed. The detailed experimental data are not only
useful for clean room design and equipment layout but also helpful
for use in the evaluation of numerical modeling in clean room
flow fields.

Abstract: The effect of using run-around heat exchanger systems
on energy use and the energy life-cycle cost of a typical large
office building has been investigated. The run-around heat exchanger
system was used for both preheating and pre-cooling the supply
ventilation outdoor air. The performance of the building using
run-around systems was studied using the DIE-2.1D program. In
order to simulate both the building systems and the run-around
systems, an existing computer program that can accurately simulate
a run-around system was incorporated into DOE92.1. An investigation
was also conducted to determine the maximum outdoor air ventilation
rate a run-around heat exchanger system allows without any increase
in energy use (or energy cost) for the building. The simulations
were conducted for Chicago, Denver, Edmonton and Fort Worth. The
results show that, compared to the energy performance of the building
without the run-around systems, the use of run-around heat exchangers
systems in the office building can reduce annual electrical energy
consumption, natural gas consumption, and total energy costs by
up to 3.5%, 40.7% and 4.8%, respectively. Boiler and chiller sizes
can be reduced by up to 32.6% and 8%, respectively. It was also
found that, through the use of run-around systems, the ventilation
rate into the building can be increased by several hundred percent
compared to 62-1989, without increasing energy costs.

Abstract: Microorganisms are well protected by the moisture surrounding
them if the relative humidity is above 70%. They can cause many
acute diseases, infections, and allergies. Humidity also has an
effect on air cleanliness and causes the building structure and
its contents to deteriorate. Therefore, controlling humidity is
a very important factor to human health and comfort and the structural
longevity of a building. To date, a great deal of research has
been done, and is continuing, in the use of both solid and liquid
desiccants. This paper introduces a desiccant-assisted system
that combines dehumidification and mechanical refrigeration by
means of a desiccant pre-conditioning module that can serve two
or more conventional air-conditioning units. It will be demonstrated
that the proposed system, also having indirect evaporative cooling
within the preconditioning module, can reduce energy consumption
and provide significant cost savings, independent humidity and
temperature control, and therefore, improved indoor air quality
and enhanced occupant comfort.

Abstract: Heat recovery in ventilation systems with humidification
of the exhaust air. Normally used heat recovery systems (cross
flow plate heat exchangers, heat pipes and rotating regeneration)
need a lot of space in the central plant. Tighter and more energy
effective are water loop systems with two heat exchangers in the
outdoor air and the exhaust air with a water circulation pipe.
Old plants can also be changed over to this system easily.

Abstract: Results are reported from a detailed parametric study
to evaluate the performance of a newly proposed hybrid solar housing
development in Monymusk, Scotland. The development embodies solar
collectors forming part of the roof structure itself and indistinguishable
in appearance from the local vernacular, a new optimised solar
roof collector system which combines both heating and ventilation
functions and the ability to automatically switch between a range
of heating and/or ventilation modes. Each dwelling unit was modelled
using degree-day properties, and the thermal performance was simulated
over a period of one year, based on expected occupancy and usage,
and using meteorological data appropriate to the geographical
location. It is concluded that with careful construction, good
thermal insulation, moderate thermal mass and properly controlled
ventilation, the collector system can meet the space and domestic
hot water heating requirements almost entirely. The annual total
heating bill, with full price electricity, could be less than
50 per dwelling at 1994 prices.

both design houses that qualify for US federal financing and market
their houses' energy efficiency. The Code is newly accessible
thanks to user-friendly software. The Code's major focus is on
building envelope insulation, including the windows. It considers
insulation on ceilings, walls (including basement walls) and floors,
and around slabs. The amount of insulation required, and window
energy efficiency, increase with the severity of the climate.
The Code allows for insulation tradeoffs between walls, ceilings

CO2 and offers guidelines on how to ensure accurate results and
accurate interpretation of those results. Measuring the carbon
dioxide concentration in an indoor space can be one of the most
useful tools of IAQ investigators, but is also liable to be misunderstood
and misused. Among the appropriate uses for CO2 measurements the
standard lists: determining the acceptability of the air in an
indoor space in terms of body odour; indicating occupancy patterns;
and estimating ventilation parameters, such as the percentage
of outdoor air at the air handler.

Abstract: In the frame of the European standardization work, an
ad hoc group of CEN TC 156, WG2 'Mechanical and natural powered
residential ventilation', is presently working out calculation
methods for the determination of air flow rates for dwellings.
A first draft standard has been prepared and is currently under
revision by the working group and experts of the national CEN
shadow committees. Since the draft with its annexes is rather
comprehensive, this article summarizes only roughly the basic
assumptions and the methods developed so far, without giving the
definitions and equations in detail. For this, the reader is referred
to the draft standard.

Abstract: It has been estimated in the Energy Conservation in
Buildings and Community Systems Strategy Plan (IEA, 1994c) that
about one quarter of all energy is consumed in dwellings within
the countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development. Also, in dwellings, within the Air Infiltration and
Ventilation Centre's member countries, the energy used for space
heating and cooling accounts for between 60% - 70% of the total
energy consumed. Furthermore, it is predicted (IEA, 1994c) that
ventilation and air movement is expected to become the dominant
heat and cooling loss mechanism in buildings of the next century.
As part of its programme of work, the AIVC has co-ordinated attempts
to quantify the part of delivered energy that is specifically
associated with infiltration and ventilation of buildings. This
has been achieved by means of a workshop, a survey and a conference.
The purpose of this paper is to present estimates of the current
situation for dwellings. The calculations given here have been
performed for each of the member countries. This article expresses
the energy impact in terms of both delivered energy and the consequent
carbon dioxide production. For some countries the air change-related
energy data have been found from published sources, and in other
cases, a nominated representative, from a particular country has
estimated the situation, or has approved such an estimation.

Abstract: The results of Joule II European research programme,

and air quality. It appears that quality of air which can blow
in buildings where ventilation rates are good is in no contradiction
with good energy conservation management. Air quality improvement
in office buildings depends on the reduction of these sources
and not on an increase of ventilation rates.

Abstract: The IEA Energy Technology Collaboration Programme provides
a cost effective mechanism, the Implementing Agreement, for Member
countries to work together on the development of new energy technologies
and their introduction into the market. The Programme has changed
as energy technology objectives have changed. The range of projects
has increased; companies are more extensively involved; and there
is more emphasis on environmental aspects of energy issues. Participation
by non-Member countries is encouraged. This publication explains
the benefits of collaborating on energy technology projects through
the IEA and demonstrates the relevance of the Programme to the
current energy policy objectives of Member and non-Member countries.
It describes how the Programme operates. It details all the current
projects, which include energy technology information centres
and research and development projects in the fields of fossil
fuels, renewable energy, efficient end-use technologies and nuclear
fusion. The achievements of these projects are set out. These
projects and their benefits deserve to be more widely known and
that is the purpose of this publication. Technology collaboration
through the IEA is proving increasingly attractive as a means
for countries to gain a better return from their energy technology
budgets.

Abstract: The purpose of this guide is to review ventilation in
the context of both energy efficiency and achieving good indoor
air quality. It is concerned primarily with providing an introduction
to the topic of ventilation with particular emphasis on the needs
of dwellings and commercial buildings. It encapsulates the knowledge
and experience derived from experts in all the participating countries
of the Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centre. Numerical descriptions
have been kept to a minimum, while emphasis is placed on describing
ventilation and the decision making involved in selecting and
planning for ventilation. By understanding this Guide, it is hoped
that the reader will be able to make fundamental judgments about
how much ventilation should be provided and how this should be
accomplished for optimum cost and energy efficiency.

Abstract: Reports on a design tool that could revolutionise the
evaluation of a building's ventilation strategies. The tool's
initial development, which is being developed under the DoE/BRE
EnREI (Energy-Related Environmental Issues) Programme, is based
on the BRES 3 TC lumped parameter simulation method. Rooms are
modelled as networks of thermal conductance and capacitance. The
tool can be used to calculate the maximum comfort temperature
during a building's occupied period. It produces outputs in three
formats: maximum comfort temperatures; daily temperature variations;
parametric variation graphs, which allow the user to explore the
effect of such variables as night ventilation rate, ceiling mass,
glazing ratio, etc.

Abstract: Based on hour-by-hour simulation studies, this paper
presents the annual energy consumption characteristics of water-panel
type cooled-ceiling systems in comparison with conventional all-air
systems. In particular, some unique energy saving measures associated
with cooled-ceiling systems are numerically studied. The results
indicate that a cooled-ceiling system can save much of the fan
energy required in all-air systems, and that in the temperate
Dutch climate, the system has a compatible energy performance
with a VAV (variable air volume) system for office-building cooling
purposes. the energy saving possibilities studies include using
ceiling water to pre- or re-heat ventilation air and using a cooling
tower for free cooling. The paper also demonstrates the possibilities
of using a simulation technique to estimate non-conventional energy
efficient system designs.

Abstract: The main aim of this report is to point out how important
the residential sector is, the variety both with respect to the
living area and number of residents, the differences in habits
and behaviour. However, we can also see that the general habits
do not differ that much from country to country. So in fact it
is pointed out here that the individual variation can be very
broad but this is rather similar in the participating countries.
With this as a base it is then possible to use the collected data
in this State of the Art report to make the assumptions to be
used in our future work with developing tools to evaluate Domestic
Ventilation Systems.

Abstract: In a displacement ventilated room the air flow pattern
is mainly governed by the convection flows from the different
heat sources. The interaction of the convection flows influences
the contamination distribution in the room. The distribution also
depends on the position and strength of the contamination sources.
Local values at the same height in the room may differ significantly.
The distribution is also sensitive to 'disturbances' in the form
of e.g. persons moving around. The factors governing the air flow
patterns were investigated by measurements of temperature gradients,
convection flow rates in plumes and contamination distributions.
The efficiency of the ventilation was measured for many different
combinations of ventilation flow rates, heat loads and contamination
sources. The temperature gradient was strongly correlated to the
ventilation flow rate and very stable. People moving around or
walking in and out of the room did not influence the shape of
the gradient. Models for the temperature gradient in balanced
and unbalanced conditions were developed. The convection flow
rate in a plume and its maximum height were influenced by the
temperature gradient. Models for the convection flow rate in a
plume from a point or a line source are given including the height
where the plumes disintegrate due to the gradient in the surroundings.
The air change efficiency increased with the ventilation flow
rate as long as the convection plumes reached the ceiling, and
decreased when the plume disintegrated below the ceiling. The
contaminant removal effectiveness was dependent on the position
of the contamination (tracer gas) source and on the interaction
of the convection flows in the room. A small change in the position
of the tracer gas source caused a great change in the contaminant
removal effectiveness. The interaction of the different convection
flows in the room also caused a great variation in the local air
quality indices measured at the same level at different positions
both with the tracer gas source in a plume and outside a plume.
When the tracer gas source was outside a plume a heavy tracer
gas spread to the floor in all measured cases while a light tracer
gas spread to the floor only at low temperature gradients independent
of the ventilation flow rate. Opening and closing of a door was
enough to destroy a stratification of contaminants with the tracer
gas source outside a plume. The local air quality indices measured
in the room with a person moving around or close to a person standing
still approached those for mixing ventilation and in some cases
even lower values were measured with the source outside a plume.
With the tracer gas source in a plume the local air quality indices
measured close to a person in all cases were higher than the values
measured at the same level in the surroundings. When monitoring
the local air quality index close to the nose of a person walking
around or sitting still much higher values than in the surroundings
were measured.

Abstract: This paper examinesaon alternative strategy for heating,
cooling, and ventilating buildings that attempts to combine the
best features of both natural and mechanical systems. It involves
a holistic approach to design that treats the building and engineering
equally. Such climate-responsive integrated building/engineering
systems are intended to operate in the natural mode whenever possible
to minimize energy use and only use mechanical systems under peak
conditions at the extremes of external temperatures. The period
of use of natural systems can be extended by using passive cooling
techniques and fabric thermal storage. Some of the building mass,
walls, ceiling slabs etc, are used as thermal storage media and
are allowed to cool overnight and absorb heat the next day. The
technique requires some automated control of natural ventilation
but both reduces energy use and, by virtue of the thermal mass
involved, limits the rise in internal temperature on occasions
when normal design criteria are exceeded. The paper described
the philosophy and operation of mixed-mode systems used in conjunction
with fabric thermal storage and suggests some guidelines for the
development of the design of a practical system.

Abstract: Ventilation of the building fabric is one method to
achieve storage of heat and cold. A popular European method is
to pass air through ducts within the floor and ceiling slabs.
That air can either be at the outside air temperature or from
the air-conditioning plant. In the former case, the intention
is to transfer cold from night to day and in the latter to reduce
peak loads by cooling the room surfaces and thus increase comfort
via radiant cooling. The performance of such systems can be assessed
by comparison with direct nighttime ventilation (say, through
windows) and traditional air-conditioning systems operating during
occupancy. The paper presents the development of a numerical model
of a ventilated floor slab for use in a dynamic thermal model
and the application of that model to a current design project.
Energy consumption cannot be ignored; however, a complete analysis
of the implication of storage systems would be a major paper.
This paper therefore considers the main energy implications associated
with slab storage systems.

Abstract: There is currently an upsurge of interest in the application
of buoyancy-driven displacement ventilation systems and chilled
ceiling devices in the office environment within the UK's heating,
ventilation and air conditioning industry. As part of a series
of research projects in the field of displacement ventilation,
the BSRIA has undertaken a programme of work to investigate whether
it is feasible to combine displacement ventilation systems and
chilled ceiling devices while still maintaining adequate levels
of thermal comfort and a predominant upward air movement. These
studies were achieved by using both physical measurements and
numerical modelling based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD)
techniques. When displacement ventilation without cooled ceilings
was considered, the airflow patterns were chiefly upward when
the internal thermal loads were equivalent to the cooling capacity
of the displacement ventilation system. On condition that the
supply air temperature and air velocity were maintained within
the recommended values, a high order of thermal comfort and air
quality were predicted. The addition of chilled beam devices to
offset higher internal thermal gains progressively eroded the
predominant upward air flow region as thermal loads were increased.
Indeed when the cooling load of the chilled ceiling devices was
about three times that of the displacement ventilation system,
the flow field was virtually similar to a conventional mixed airflow
system, except in the vicinity of heat sources where upward convective
plumes entrain air from the displacement cool air layer at floor
level. The simulation of displacement ventilation with chilled
panels, however, showed that the radiant cold panels slightly
increased the depth of the mixed warm and contaminated upper region,
but it did not affect the displacement airflow characteristics
of the lower part of the room. The environmental thermal comfort
conditions, however, were of a very high order in all cases considered.

Abstract: The subject of this paper is the computational determination
of the air diffusion performance index (ADPI) of a cold air jet
in an enclosure. The jet outlet size, temperature, momentum and
Archimedes number were varied to produce a range of attached and
separate flow regimes. The cooling load was produced by heating
one of the room walls. The effect of using conventional and cold
supply jets was investigated for two heat source locations. The
results indicate that, for the type of diffuser and room configuration
studied, an optimum ADPI was obtained when the jet separation
distance is approximately equal to the room characteristic length.
Room airflow, conditions produced by conventional and cold air
supply temperature air are almost identical to each other when
the same separation distance criteria, ie. same momentum flux,
are used.

Abstract: When designing comfortable workspaces, traditional design
criteria such as dry-bulb temperature and operative temperature
are not always sufficient. Using the predicted mean vote (PMV)
as the design parameter, it becomes evident as to what system
should be used to condition the space. The projects described
in this paper show that the mean radiant temperature (MRT) has
a large influence on the comfort results. Therefore, the application
of radiant heating and cooling panels would prove an optimal solution
to the conditioning of the space within comfort limits (PMV+/-0.5).

Abstract: Active control of the storage mass of an office building
in Horgen, Switzerland, by means of a water-carrying pipe system
installed in the core of the concrete ceilings has already proven
successful over a period of three summers. Comfort measurements
in practice and under load-simulated operating conditions have
confirmed the suitability of the system for small and medium loads.
During the day, only the supply air volume of the mechanical ventilation
system is cooled to a temperature of 19 degree C (66.2 degrees
F); the heat stored in the concrete mass is discharged overnight.
However, the proportion of cooling water generated in the free-cooling
mode remained below expectations. This is attributable to the
clearly lower inner thermal loads and the facade insulation which
is no longer up-to-date. Since the building already dispenses
a part of its heat via the facade on cooler summer nights, the
utilization efficiency of the free concrete core-cooling system
diminishes somewhat in importance. The experience gained, however,
is recommendation enough for the employment of the embedded pipework
system, not only for the cooling but also for the heating of well-insulated
buildings with small and medium cooling loads.

Abstract: Indirect evaporative cooling (IDEC) is a proven technology
that can reduce mechanical cooling demand and energy requirements.
Various concepts are available in predesigned configurations for
incorporation with packaged or semi-custom manufactured heating,
ventilating and air-conditioning (HVAC) equipment. Application
of indirect evaporative cooling in large built-up HVAC systems
is often not considered, thereby missing the opportunity for significant
savings potential. This paper discusses four concepts that have
been successfully applied in large systems and the associated
cooling and energy savings and is an overview of previously published
work (see bibliography). These savings can provide a significant
contribution toward meeting the proposed Tier 1 energy savings
requirement of ASHRAE Standard 90.1-1989R.

Abstract: Proceedings of a workshop organised as part of the UK
contribution to the Future Buildings Forum, which was officially
started in June 1991 under the 'Energy Conservation in Buildings
and Community Systems Programme' of the International Energy Agency.
Its aim is to contribute to a sustainable society by means of
enriching international building energy research with topics which
will be of importance during the next century. The FBF tries to
investigate the future situation which will influence the needs
of our building stock. It will address energy, environmental,
economic and technical issues. The 'Innovative Cooling Workshop'
is the first workshop in a programme of six, which have the aim
to identify and study energy, environmental, economic, and technological
issues that will affect the building industry by the year 2025
and beyond; to define research priorities to resolve these issues
in and outside the building industry; and to monitor and disseminate
technological advances affecting the state of the future in building
technology; to positively influence the efficient conception,
design, construction, renovation and operation of buildings.

Abstract: If the cooling capacity is introduced into a room above
the heating sources, mainly in rooms with mixed flow, certain
air velocities not being able to be kept within will be found
in the room even if the outlets are adjusted optimally. This knowledge
existed already earlier. Experiments with cooled ceilings show
now that these velocities depend only on the cooling capacity
related to the floor area for a given geometry. The experimental
results also give hints to which area the capacity has to be related.
The good agreement with the known velocities in mixed flows encourages
to extend the results of cooled ceilings to mixed flow.

Abstract: The purpose of ventilation is to maintain and improve
air quality in a building by removing polluted air and supplying
fresh air. In principle, the required ventilation rates for desired
air quality can be calculated if the pollution loads, outdoor
air quality and requested indoor air quality are known. This method
is often referred to as an air quality method in ventilation design.
A European prestandard 'Ventilation for Buildings - Design Criteria
for the Indoor Environment' outlines such a method. The data for
the application of the standard is rapidly accumulating through
extensive measurements and is soon available for the general application
in ventilation design. Because the data are not yet completed
for practical use, additional prescriptive requirements and criteria
have to be used in the design of ventilation systems. These criteria
include such aspects as the selection of ventilation strategy,
ventilation rates, balancing of airflows, ventilation effectiveness,
local exhaust systems, cleaning of intake air, location of air
intakes, cleanliness of equipment, air recirculation, air tightness,
noise control and demand controlled ventilation. The reasoning
behind these requirements is presented and discussed in the paper.

Abstract: Why are we ventilating buildings and how much ventilation
is required? These are the fundamental questions that engineers,
architects and hygienists have tried to answer over the last two
hundred years. During this period, dramatic changes have been
seen in the philosophy behind ventilation. Ventilation standards
are at present being revised in different parts of the world.
Common trends in the revisions will be discussed and reviewed
in a historical perspective.

Abstract: The space between neighbouring two detached houses has
been often narrow in built up areas and becomes smaller in recent
suburban areas. It is sometimes too narrow to be used as a reasonable
space, which means that it is a dead space, and such a space is
called an inter-house gap in this paper. However, the authors
carried out a field survey to examine the thermal conditions and
air flow in an inter-house gap in summer to find that the micro
climate in the space was different from the thermal environment
in the surrounding space. The air temperature in the inter-house
gap is lower than that in the surrounding outdoor space in the
daytime, and the air flow in the space was controlled by the shaper
of the inter-house gap. These results indicate that it is possible
to use the inter-house gap as a thermal buffer zone between indoor
and outdoor space or a useful natural cooling resource in summer,
although it is not useful as an ordinary active space. Therefore,
if the neighbouring two houses are well designed to utilize the
characteristics of the thermal conditions in the inter-house gap,
it will contribute to the indoor thermal environment. The natural
ventilation is one of the most effective methods to introduce
the cool air in an inter-house gap into neighbouring indoor spaces,
since the air flow in an inter-house gap may be controlled by
the shaper of the inter-house gap to be useful for this device.
For this purpose, the characteristics of the air flow in an inter-house
gap, especially the wind pressure on the neighbouring walls, have
to be studied more deeply. A series of wind tunnel tests to examine
the characteristics of the wind pressure on the walls facing to
inter-house gaps are reported in this paper.

Abstract: A nationwide energy and indoor climate survey has been
carried out in Sweden (the ELIB study). The study indicates that
between 600,000 and 900,000 Swedes or about 10% of the population
are exposed to indoor climates that can affect their health and
well-being. Ventilation, in particular, is poor in Swedish dwellings.
Ventilation does not come up to the norms in four of five single-family
houses and in about half of the apartments in multi-family buildings.
Another finding is that residents in new, large multi-family buildings
and people suffering from allergies are most troubled by defects
in the indoor climate. By increasing the ventilation, the problems
of humid indoor air and high radon concentration would be reduced
considerably. The percentage of single-family houses with humidity
of indoor air exceeding 45% RH in the air would decreased from
19% to only 4%. The proportion of dwellings with radon concentrations
above the norms would be reduced considerably. The consequences
of ventilation on the dryness of indoor air in some buildings
must also be taken into account, however. An increase n ventilation
would lead to a substantial increase in the energy used. The ventilation
losses in the housing stock would increase by about 36% (from
about 22 TWh to about 30 TWh annually).

Abstract: The house dust mite (Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus)
is found in furnishings in most homes. Although only a fraction
of a millimetre in size, it has been identified as an important
risk to health because of the allergens both on its enticle and
in the faeces. When the allergen becomes airborne, it is a potent
provoker of asthma and almost certainly contributed to the 2000
asthma-related deaths which occur each year in the UK.The widespread
occurrence of D.pteronyssinus and its potential for causing serious
effects on health have prompted research to establish ways of
removing it from homes. In principle then, increased ventilation
should be capable of reducing indoor humidity and eliminating
dust mites. This raises the question of what humidity must be
achieved and whether, in practice, ventilation alone can maintain
the critical humidity. The critical humidity for dust mite survival
has been stated as 7g/kg absolute humidity, equivalent to about
40-45% RH (Korsgard 1982). The Danish results suggest that installing
whole-house mechanical ventilation with heat recovery (MVHR) will
not only cause a significant reduction in dust mite populations,
but bring about a clinically relevant reduction in asthma symptoms.
Full MVHR achieves a controlled air flow, ensuring a reliable
supply of outside air to all rooms and extraction from moisture-producing
rooms (kitchen and bathroom). It is claimed that the clinical
benefits are greater than those obtained with any prophylactic
drugs. Furthermore, it has been shown (using assumed rates of
moisture production indoors) that the critical humidity can be
achieved using MVHR for much of a typical winter over much of
the UK (McIntyre 1993). In the UK, the outdoor humidity exceeds
7g/kg for 5% of the winter (from December to March) but is generally
below 5g/kg during this period. Extracting moist air from the
house and replacing it by relatively dry air from outside could
therefore reduce humidity levels indoors to below those required
for HDM survival. In spite of the existing findings, there are
some doubts as to the likely impact of MVHR on mites in UK homes:
(a) the critical humidity of 7g/kg is achieved for a smaller proportion
of the year in the UK than in Denmark, (b) furnishings and cleaning
practices may differ between the two countries and (c) UK homes
are typically less tight than those built in Denmark, which will
render MVHR less effective. It is therefore important to replicate
the Danish work in the UK. To achieve an improvement in asthmatics'symptoms
it is necessary not only to reduce the number of dust mites but
also to remove the allergen already present in the home. The regular
use of a high efficiency vacuum cleaner designed to collect dust
without recirculating fine dust into the room air is thought to
be capable of reducing the allergens reservoir in soft furnishings.

Abstract: There are many reasons for promoting a thorough examination
of requirements for domestic aeration and ventilation systems:
There is an emerging awareness of the relationship between home
and health. Pollution levels inside the home, often higher than
those outside, can only be brought down to within acceptable limits
by using efficient specific ventilation systems. About one fifth
of French homes have no specific ventilation system. Insufficient
ventilation is one of the major errors committed when renovating
old buildings. Paradoxically enough, systematic installation of
airtight windows is rarely compensated by provision for a suitable
air circulation system. About 30% of renovated buildings suffer
from this serious defect. Many older ventilation systems are now
in urgent need of replacement or adaption. Wide-reaching public
information programmes on energy saving fail to mention the need
for aeration.

Abstract: An office building situated in downtown Zurich was investigated.
It contains 750 workstations on 5 floors, each separated into
3 large open space offices. Floors and walls were mainly covered
by carpets and smoking was generally allowed. The goal was to
study the effects of interventions on Indoor Air Quality (IAQ)
and the Building Symptom Index (BSI). The building was investigated
right before, in August 1994, and one month after each change,
in November 1994 and February 1995. Key IAQ parameters were measured
(CO2, TVOC, VOC, oxidizable gases, formaldehyde, temperature and
humidity). A questionnaire was distributed to a large sample of
occupants to assess their judgment on air quality and building
related symptoms. Carpet cleaning lead to a higher air acceptability
and partly to a reduction of the BSI. A combination of carpet
cleaning and non-smoking had only small positive effects on BSI
and the air acceptability. The effects of reducing the mean temperature
had only insignificant positive effects on the judgments of occupants
and the reported symptoms. The measured physical and chemical
IAQ parameters did not show significant differences between the
investigated offices and the three periods. Conclusions: The use
of the questionnaire is an important additional tool to assess
indoor air conditions. Chemical and physical parameters alone
do not necessarily represent the perceived IAQ. Cleaning of carpeted
walls with a liquid extraction system, combined with a small reduction
of total carpet surface, has a positive effect on the perceived
air quality which could be explained by a reduction of surface
pollution emission. Additional non-measured factors seem to have
an important influence on the perceived IAQ and the building related
symptoms. Radiant temperature and illumination, in relation to
sun exposure, could be such factors.

Abstract: As part of a coordinated effort by the United States
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to evaluate radon reduction
schools technology, indoor air quality measurements were conducted
in 12 school buildings across the U.S. to establish a database
of specific contaminant levels. A subset of this data consisted
of particle measurements reflecting real-time particle counts
in conjunction with time weighted average gravimetric PM-10 data.
Elevated levels of gravimetric indoor PM-10 concentrations were
measured in the schools. These levels may be attributed to various
factors including low ventilation rates, high occupant density,
classroom activity and entrainment of particles released from
carpeted floors. A relation between the particle counts and PM-10
measurements is presented in this paper from the measurements
taken in the non-smoking school environments. The relation does
provide an initial tool to approximate PM-10 concentrations as
a function of particle count data. While premature, at present,
it does hold promise as more paired counts and PM-10 measurements
are added from other schools throughout the U.S.

Abstract: Human exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS)
is a function of two factors: (i) ETS generated in the indoor
environment, and (ii) ETS removed from indoor air by ventilation
and air filtration processes. One principal aspect of both is
size distribution of the particulate phase of tobacco smoke. The
aim of the research presented here was to investigate size characteristics
of ETS in several residential and public places and the effect
ventilation had on time change of the characteristics. An important
conclusion from this research is that natural ventilation which
is the most common type of ventilation in sub tropical climates,
is often not sufficient for reducing human exposure to ETS. In
some residential houses, ETS concentration was still high three
hours after generation and the mean particle size remained unchanged
for most of the measurement period. A broad, well defined ETS
peak with concentration in the peak up to 5 x 10 to the power
of 4 particles cm-3 is often observed in club air during events
when large numbers of smokers are present, regardless of the efforts
to improve air quality by natural ventilation.

Abstract: There is a growing awareness among the health and safety
authorities, building and environmental regulatory bodies, building
owners and more importantly the building users of the importance
of preventing or at least reducing the risk of environmental tobacco
smoke (ETS) in public buildings. This awareness coincides with
the studies around the world on whether the levels of carcinogens
in the diluted sidestream smoke of tobacco products are sufficient
to cause cancer. It has been reported that passive smoking increases
the risk of lung cancer in non-smokers, and that it may also be
connected to heart disease. This risk was reported to be in the
range of 10 to 30%. In addition, ETS has irritant effects such
as eye irritation, headaches, throat and nasal symptoms, and can
aggravate asthma. It can obscure vision and creates an unpleasant
odour. The UK government's code of practice on smoking in public
places promotes the use of separate rooms for smokers, with non
smoking being the norm in most places. In some establishments,
however, it is impractical to supply totally separate rooms for
smokers and non-smokers and the space may be divided into smoking
and non-smoking areas with limited physical partitioning. This
allows ETS to migrate from the smoking areas to the non-smoking
areas, and the extent to which this takes place depends upon the
ventilation and partitioning strategy. Guidance needs to be provided
for such cases on how best to ventilate the spaces and what effect
partial partitioning will have. In this paper a comparative assessment
of alternative ventilation strategies and space partitioning for
minimising migration of tobacco smoke in to public building enclosures
is reported. The study is based on computational fluid dynamics
(CFD) modelling and uses an airborne contaminant as the 'marker'
for ETS migration.

Abstract: Following considerable lobbying by anti-smoking campaigners
in the UK, environmental health officers employed by the local
councils have agreed to test pubs which have been reported as
'too smoky'. Whereas a customer may enter a smoky atmosphere and
then decide to walk away from it, this option is not available
to staff. Of more significance therefore, and to employers as
well as to the individuals is the potential effect of passive
smoking on the staff who work in public houses. Legislation in
the UK (Health and Safety Executive, 1974) places a duty of care
on employers to provide and maintain a safe working environment
for employees without risks to health. Previous work by the authors
(Currie and Capper, 1994) involved the assessment of public houses
in the north of England and southern Scotland with the aim of
identifying potential problems and considering improvements that
could be made to accommodate best environmental practice. Environmental
tobacco smoke (ETS) surrogates were measured, together with carbon
dioxide (CO2) as a general air quality indicator. The air quality
assessments in each establishment identified potential problems
in respect of the traditional design approach to ventilated spaces.
Recent studies have tended to concentrate on the subjective assessment
of environmental health issues and there is therefore a need for
more objective assessment methods. A computerised fluid dynamics
(CFD) model ARIA has been used to model airflows with the aim
of identifying inefficiencies in existing ventilation systems,
for example air distribution 'dead-spots'.

Abstract: In the last ten years an increased attention has been
devoted to the indoor air quality for different reasons: 1) it
has been emphasised that many domestic components (that is building
materials, furniture, fuel for heating and cooking, etc.) can
emanate chemical or radioactive pollutants or that biological
contaminants can be present in indoor air; 2) energy saving programs,
born in the seventies, led people to reduce the air exchanges
in indoor environments and 3) in urban areas most people spend
most of their time indoors at home or indoors elsewhere, that
is schools, offices, etc. In particular, for the Italian population,
in the frame of the recent representative National Survey on radon
indoors, data on the permanency indoors at home and indoors elsewhere
has been collected: it showed that on the average the Italian
population spends about 80% of its time in indoor environments
(F. Bochicchio et al., 1994a). As a development of the National
Survey, in the last years a pilot study was designed and is being
carried out in Rome (F.Bochicchio et al.1994b) to study the main
parameters influencing the exposure of radon and radon progeny
in domestic environments. Among these parameters natural ventilation
has been studied, because in most of the Italian houses forced
ventilation systems are very rarely used. For this reason the
detection of the eventual effective decrease of radon and radon
progeny concentration indoors due to natural ventilation could
have useful implication for domestic environments in temperate
climate areas, in search of a balance between energy conservation
and air exchange rates.

Abstract: In Portugal a national indoor radon survey was developed
by the Health Physics and Safety Department and some regions with
high indoor radon levels were identified. Actually some procedures
are being studied in order to reduce the indoor radon levels.
This paper refers two different situations. In the first case,
an experimental room was built and the walls were covered with
phosphogypsum which is sometimes employed as building material.
Integrated measurements had been performed with nuclear passive
track detectors, LR-115s, exposed for 1-2 month periods. Afterwards,
two types of wall coverings are being studies, with the purpose
to mitigate the increase of indoor radon due to the utilisation
of phosphogypsum employed as building material. The other situation
concerns the application of reduction techniques in a real dwelling
situated in a granitic and uranium mining region with high indoor
radon concentrations. In this case, the main radon source term
had been identified. Some mitigation procedures, including natural
ventilation, replacement of the floor with a vinyl material and
the wall cracks sealed were performed. In both cases, the different
steps concerning the reduction techniques studies are described
and the respective effectiveness evaluated.

Abstract: It is well recognised that greater part of environmental
radiation dose to human comes from natural radiation, while its
major contribution is from radon and its short-lived decay products
in air. Their inhalation can induce lung cancer which had brought
about popular notice. The effect of indoor radon and its daughters
in air on inhabitants' health is concerned as their main living
space is indoor. Indoor radon concentrations in air are approx
25 Bq/m3 under normal living conditions in China, i.e. doors and
windows are opened or closed normally. But it can vary due to
alter some housing conditions, such as fixing air conditioner
and so on. Along with the improvement of Chinese Peoples' living
standards, air conditioners have already come into population's
home right now. It has actual living standards, air conditioners
have already come into populations home right now. It has actual
meanings to study their affection on indoor radon level as a previous
research in health physics field.

Abstract: The indoor air quality IAQ is of fundamental importance
with regard to the evaluation and certification of healthy buildings.
Because only precise, accurate and statistically controlled analytical
results allow conclusions to be drawn about the quality of air
and the risks related to chemicals, quality assurance for air
analysis is the object of advanced research. The decrease of air
infiltration existing in modern buildings, due to the presence
of indoor sources of contaminants emitted by materials, the increase
of outdoor polluted air, and the problems related to ventilation
energy costs, assign a primary consideration in ventilation engineering.
Monitoring and controlling the mechanical ventilation is the main
reason to develop suitable sensors, since IAQ cannot be measured
objectively, the concept for acceptable air has been defined.
This applies to air which does not contain any known contaminants
in harmful concentrations and which is accepted without complaint
by more than 80% of those people exposed to it . Among organic
substances those with molecular weight greater than 300 are generally
odourless, and even if potent olfactory stimuli derived from some
substances can be perceived at very low concentrations, they may
not be detected by existing instruments. Olfactory sensitivity
often is able to detect potentially harmful substances at concentrations
below dangerous levels and therefore able to eliminate them. It
is important to consider odour as a IAQ indicator because a sensory
approach (odours and irritations) has a fundamental role for the
IAQ characterisation, being a complementary method of the traditional
physic, chemical and microbiological studies utilised to measure
the exposure (Kirchner et al., 1994). Odours and irritants thresholds,
however, because of a poorly available systematic review, may
vary by several orders of magnitude - and further studies must
be carried out in order to determine more precise indications.
Although the perceived indoor air quality presently can only bemeasured
by means of test subjects rather than with measuring instruments,
reference to this approach is nevertheless appearing in HVAC ventilation
standards (CEN, 1994); critical review showed that these standards
could be based on scientific definitions to allow measurable outcomes
indicating adverse effects on comfort, such as annoyance and irritation
as a function of dilution ventilation (Rehva, 1995). A look at
the limitations of present IAQ guidelines suggests a promising
alternative approach for judging the acceptability of IAQ based
on antropic gases (CO2 and/or NH3) monitoring as an integrated
measure of all airborne contaminants present in ambient air, to
do it the IAQ guidelines can be based on both specific contaminants
of pollutant mixtures and global presence of contaminants in the
mixtures (Light et al, 1992). The possibility to apportion contaminants
to major classes of emission sources, is generally obtained using
a sensory panel, CO and CO2 measurements. Many studies have apportioned
the perceived IAQ degradation to three categories: occupants,
smoking and building materials including HVAC system. CO serves
as a surrogate for cigarette smoking, CO2 for bioeffluents, but
presently only sensory measures can significantly indicate the
importance of the HVAC system and building materials as contaminant
sources (Fanger, 1988). Unfortunately, the relationship of the
sensory responses to physical-chemical measures is not clear.
In particular, nonlinearity and thresholds of sensory responses
should be taken into account when identifying sources quantitatively
(Batterman et al, 1995, Pejtersen et al, 1993). The concentration
of CO2 in a room remains a subjective variable for the evaluation
of IAQ, even though its value can be defined exactly. Except for
particular boundary conditions, no relationship (Persily, 1993)
can be found between the CO2 concentration in a room and the IAQ
perceived by the human nose. Otherwise, first one substance and
then another would dominate the sense of smell. It is therefore
of little significance to measure concentration of individual
gas selectively, leading to the assumption that the gas mixture
must be evaluated as a whole. That is what the mixed gas sensors
do.

Abstract: The use of non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) to measure
equilibrium carbon dioxide concentration, and hence to infer ventilation
rate, is rapidly gaining acceptance. However, other applications
use both the time-dependent and equilibrium carbon dioxide concentration
to determine other ventilation parameters including: tracing of
reintrainment routes, determining air-mix ratios, assisting in
commissioning and rebalancing of HVAC systems, performing walk-through
IAQ audits and checking for ventilation short-circuiting. The
common technology of NDIR offers its advantages and disadvantages
when compared with other technologies, especially electrochemical
cells which offer low power, fast response and better resistance
to shock and humidity. This paper compares the accuracy and ease
of use of these technologies in different applications.

Abstract: Healthy buildings are to a great extent a question of
indoor air quality. The processes involved in air quality can
be looked upon as a number of links in a chain. Typical links
will be emission from building materials, convection and diffusion
in the room, local airflow around a person, personal exposure
and at last the effect of the air quality on the occupant. The
best results will obviously be obtained by using building materials
with low emission. However, there will always exist some emission
and the ventilation will consequently be an important link. Aalborg
University has worked with several inks as shown in figure 1.
The elements in a model for emission from building materials (1)
will be discussed in the first chapter of this paper. Transport
by convection and diffusion (2) will be addressed in the following
chapter, and the flow around a person (3) will be handled in a
third chapter. An occupant's role as emission source (4) is described
by examples in the last chapter.

Abstract: Experiments on the adsorption/desorption of volatile
compounds on building materials have been performed in a 1 m3
dynamic chamber ventilated by clean air. Different types of materials
commonly found in buildings (glass plate, floor and wall coverings,
gypsum board and acoustic tiles) have been exposed to the vapour
of 2-butoxyethanol introduced in the chamber at constant concentration.
Both adsorption and desorption phases where followed under different
environmental conditions (16, 23 and 30 degrees C , 45 and 70%
RH). Mathematical modelling of the data has been used to describe
the observed sink phenomena. Except for the glass plate, 2-butoxyethanol
presents clear evidence of adsorption and desorption on all other
tested materials. Temperature and humidity significantly affect
these reactions. Complementary methods aimed at describing the
microphysical shape of the materials appear to be useful for the
evaluation of their adsorbing properties.

Abstract: In order to investigate the factors influencing air
quality inside hospitals, the concentration of atmospheric gases
and of pollutant vapours was monitored in air-conditioned and
naturally ventilated hospital buildings located in urban areas
with different vehicular traffic density. The quality of inside
air is strongly dictated by outside pollution, the latter mainly
depending on hospital position with reference to automotive sources,
as far as showed by measured CO and CO2 time profiles. CO2 indoor
pollution is mainly dependent from human presence and its effect
is particularly relevant in conditions of crowding and insufficient
ventilation of environments, where CO2 build-up higher than 3500
mg/m3 can cause subjective discomfort. Indoor pollution from volatile
organics can be traced to peculiar sources and is characteristic
of hospital activities, with respect to other collective buildings,
mainly due to the extensive use of cleaning products and sanitary
auxiliaries.

Abstract: The users and operators of hospitals have never been
more aware than they are now of the risk that patients and surgeons
may complain about the indoor climate, especially in operational
rooms. A substantial proportion of all new operational rooms created
in old buildings or in new buildings is in the category of 'problem
rooms'. About 80% of doctors are dissatisfied with indoor climate
conditions and they say that their success depends not only on
their ability but on indoor climate conditions as well. The more
operational rooms are old the more it seemed to lead to more complaints.
This situation is partially due to the fact that in the old operational
rooms is a mechanical ventilation without special equipment for
maintenance indoor climate conditions. There are more works closely
related to the air distribution systems for operational rooms.
A main subject of these works is due to air flow patterns for
operational rooms and to the equipment of the air distribution
system.

there was no temptation to prescribe them 'hypersensitivity' because
for the patient rooms there was the same dissatisfaction. One
of the most common complaints of indoors in winter was that the
air felt dry. It was decided that it was not a spread of rumour
but it was a problem, which has to be solved by the scientific
and technical approach. The central stations of the air conditioning

Abstract: In wards used for Patients recovering from bone marrow
transplants, it is necessary to ensure a high degree of air cleanliness
inside the rooms. The patients themselves also have to be included
as sources of pathological agents. Differential pressurization
between zones of high and low contamination is necessary, and
a reliable differential pressurization can be obtained only by
means of a mechanical ventilation system and different flow rates
of supply and return air. A high degree of air sterility can be
obtained by introducing outdoor air into the occupied space after
adequate filtration. The paper compares three ventilation systems
in terms of energy consumption (thermal and electrical) and installation
costs.

of them and in the room immediately downstream. The instrumental
and operational accuracy, associated with the consistent procedure
of the data-logging operation, allow us to make comparisons between
the measurements, even if the applications were different. The
values monitored were: number of solid particles suspended in
the air, their distribution according to size and the bacterial

the displacement flow without a cooling ceiling. This article

stratified to mixing flow and the consequences for concentration

a major influence on the temperature and mass (eg. particles,
gases, contaminants) distribution and thus on the thermal comfort
and air quality of the room occupants. There are important differences
between the different ventilation systems concerning the energy
and mass transfer. Especially for displacement flow the energy-
and mass transfer is considerable because there is a marked temperature-
and concentration distribution in the room. The aim of this investigation
is to show the different mechanisms which are responsible for
the temperature- and concentration distribution in rooms with
displacement flow.

Abstract: Displacement ventilation systems in German called 'Quelluftung'
become more and more popular and have proved themselves in many
different applications in comfort as well as in industrial air
conditioning systems. However, there are many uncertainties according
to the design of the systems. In a research project the basis
and the technical conditions had been worked out. The influence
of the air outlet and the heat sources on the temperature and
contaminant distribution within the room was investigated. Displacement
ventilation introduces supply air into the room at or near floor
level and at a temperature lower than that of the ambient room
air. The supply air thus fills the room from the floor up, displacing
the old air and any contaminants that it carried. Additional buoyancy
flows caused by heat sources are overlapping the displacement
flow. The buoyancy flow is greater than the displacement and this
causes the typical stratification of source flow. There is a layer
of supply air near the floor, upwards there is a layer of mixed
air, which is primarily influenced by the location and intensity
of the heat sources. Above the mixing zone there is another displacement
zone up to the ceiling, where the exhaust air is taken. When room
ventilation is by displacement, temperature and contaminant concentrations
increase with the height of the room. Without any heat sources,
this gradient would be uniform. However, in typical rooms, heat
sources such as people or equipment should cause convection currents
that result in the cleaner air near the floor being forced upward
into the breathing zone at a rate higher than the displacement
flow. The displacement flow rate should be lower than the convection
flow rate because maintaining a low velocity in the supply air
prevents drafts from becoming a problem. Displacement ventilation
flow rate should ideally remain below 0.2 metres per second.

Abstract: One reason for complaints about air-conditioning systems
in offices is draught. As a consequence of this, air-conditioning
systems were developed in which the inlet air streams slowly into
the room showing the following characteristics: low degree of
turbulence, low air velocity and low temperature at ground level.
The inlet air therefore forms a 'lake' of around heated bodies
by self-convection and are accordingly low. In order to facilitate
higher cooling loads, so-called 'ceiling-coolings' are used in
addition. The range of applicability of such air-conditioning
systems, with regard to thermal comfort, was investigated by the
Fraunhofer-Institut fur Bauphysik (IBP) and the results are described
in the paper. The main results are: 1. The air temperature at
foot level should not fall below a value of 22oC. 2. The operative
temperature at head level should not exceed a value of 24oC.

Abstract: Fifty six office buildings in nine European countries
were audited during the heating season of 1993-1994 (1) The audits
were performed according to a standard procedure, within the frame
of the 'European Audit project to optimize indoor air quality
and energy consumption in office buildings', sponsored by the
European Community through the Joule II programme. The main aim
of this EC-Audit was to develop assessment procedures and guidance
on ventilation and source control, which help to assure indoor
air quality and optimize energy use in office buildings. 15 institutes
from 11 countries (The Netherlands, Denmark, France, Belgium,
United Kingdom, Greece, Switzerland, Finland, Norway, Germany
and Portugal) participated. By determining the pollution load
(chemically and sensory), the ventilation performance and the
energy consumption, and by identifying the pollution sources,
recommendations can be made to avoid excessive energy consumption
and ensure air quality by source control and ventilation. A common
agreed Europe-wide method to investigate indoor air quality in
office buildings, including a common agreed European questionnaire
and walk-through survey checklist were developed (2). This paper
presents the general results and recommendations of the audit
in 56 buildings in Europe. Detailed results and discussions can
be found in the final report (1).

Abstract: Fifty-six office buildings, selected in nine European
countries for being as far as possible representative of the building
stock, were audited between December 1993 and March 1994. These
audits were performed according to a standard procedure, within
the frame of the 'European Audit Project to Optimise Indoor Air
Quality and Energy Consumption in Office Buildings', part of the
JOULE Programme (CEC-DG XII). The main purpose of office buildings
is to provide a comfortable working environment for occupants.
This includes, among others, thermal, visual and acoustical comfort
as well as indoor air quality. One of the objectives of the survey
was hence to assess the actual quality of the indoor environment
in office buildings. Measured parameters concerning the quality
of indoor environment included occupant satisfaction, sick building
symptoms and concentration of contaminants. Yearly energy consumption
data were also gathered for each building. Ventilation performance
in terms of air flow rate and indoor air quality was compared
to a proposed European pre-standard and related to occupant satisfaction
and energy consumption. Theoretically, energy is required to control
the indoor climate and indoor air quality. Therefore, it is a
common perception that energy savings will result in a poorer
quality indoor environment. It was interesting therefore to relate
energy consumption to various parameters describing the indoor
environment. The results show that good indoor environment is
compatible with low energy consumption. Good quality energy services
do not necessarily incur a high energy use.

Abstract: The U.S. EPA's Office of Radiation and Indoor Air (ORIA)
has initiated a major study of indoor air quality (IAQ) to fill
a significant data gap that exists regarding baseline IAQ in public
and commercial office buildings. The goal of the study is to define
the status of the existing building stock with respect to IAQ
and occupant perception. The on-going cross-sectional study, entitled
Building Assessment Survey and Evaluation (BASE) Program, is collecting
baseline data characterizing public and commercial office buildings.
The study buildings are randomly selected without regard to IAQ
complaints. Core parameters and measured in a representative space
in each building. This paper discusses the study design and the
building and study space selection. Summaries of building descriptions
and the results of measurements related to thermal comfort and
ventilation for the first thirteen buildings are also included.
The building descriptions include information about building age;
size; study area location within the building; heating, air-conditioning
and ventilation (HVAC) system type; occupant activities; smoking
policy; and percent outdoor air. The measurements related to thermal
comfort include indoor and outdoor temperatures and relative humidities.
The data collected are coded for confidentiality and are in a
publicly-accessible database. A separate paper (Part II) presents
the results of pollutant measurements and occupant perceptions.

Abstract: This paper will present a summary of environment pollutant
measurements and occupant perceptions of IAQ in thirteen buildings.
These results include concentrations of formaldehyde, particles
(PM10 and PM25) and bioaerosols (fungi and bacteria). Nearly thirty
volatile organic compounds (VOC) were also measured, but these
data are extensive and quality assurance procedures are not yet
complete, precluding their presentation in this paper. To facilitate
comparisons with the European Audit Study, the occupant perceptions
as measured by a self-administered questionnaire were used to
calculate a six-symptom Building Symptom Index (BSI), which is
reported as well as the incidence of selected individual symptoms.

Abstract: The effects of office furniture design and workstation
layouts on ventilation performance, contaminant removal efficiency
and thermal comfort conditions in workstations were studied. The
range of furniture configurations and environmental parameters
investigated included: 1) partition heights, 2) partition gap
size, 3) diffuser types, 4) supply air diffuser location relative
to the workstation, 5) return air grill location relative to workstation,
6) heat source locations, 7) presence of furniture, 8) supply
air temperatures, 9) adjacent workstations, 10) contaminant source
locations, 11) supply air flow rates, and 12) outdoor air flow
rates. The tracer gas technique was used to study experimentally
the relative impact of these parameters on the air distribution
and ventilation performance, as well as contaminant removal efficiency.
The results showed that the outdoor air flow rate had significant
influence on the mean age of air. The air distributions in all
the workstations were good even when the supply air flow rate
was relatively low (ie. 5 L/s). At the same time, most of the
parameters tested had significant influence on contaminant removal
efficiency when there was a contaminant source present somewhere
in the office.

Abstract: Investigations were conducted in 1994 in six office
buildings located in the Paris region, in the frame of the 'European
Audit Project to Optimize Indoor Air Quality and Energy Consumption
in Office Buildings' (JOULE II Programme). Investigated buildings
presented various types of building characteristics such as ventilation
or air conditioning systems, indoor walls, floors, ceilings and
insulation materials. Questionnaires were filled in by occupants
for questions related to indoor environment acceptability and
health symptoms. The questionnaire analysis showed two groups
of buildings with significant difference in prevalence of reported
symptoms which is discussed in the paper in relation to building
characteristics and ventilation rate. Health symptoms were also
found to be in correlation with indoor air acceptability rated
by occupants. Outdoor air flow rates were shown to be related
to indoor air acceptability.

Abstract: In the framework of the 'European Audit Project to Optimize
Indoor Air Quality and Energy Consumption in Office Buildings'
detailed ventilation studies were planned to apply recently developed
measurement techniques in-situ and to validate their application
and utility. This field-testing was carried out in two office
buildings selected among the 56 European office buildings being
the subject of the IAQ audit in the project. The overall measurements,
carried out at building level in ventilation systems, proved to
be very relevant for understanding building operation. They are
the subject of this paper summarising the most import outcomes.
Detailed information can be found in the project final reports.
Both investigated buildings are equipped with very large balanced
ventilation systems (about 35,000 and 140.000 m/h). It is important
to mention that a high precision gas analyser was used (B &amp;
K type 1302) and that some measurements would probably not have
been possible with less accurate device.

Abstract: Recent rapid increases in global atmospheric contamination
levels, especially in metropolitan areas, lead to high attention
to indoor air qualities in commercial buildings located in the
polluted areas. One of the most common methods to provide office
workers with a clean and comfortable indoor air environment is
ventilation, in which a certain portion of the return air from
the interior spaces is replaced by outdoor air in the air handling
unit (AHU). Indeed, ventilation is the most effective method of
maintaining a high quality indoor air environment when the outdoor
air is fresher than the indoor air. However, ventilation usually
causes higher energy consumption in HVAC system due to the temperature
and humidity controls with the raw outdoor air. Therefore, it
is a key objective of this field study to identify the impact
of outdoor air intake rates at the air handling units on the indoor
air contaminant levels in commercial office buildings especially
located in metropolitan areas. A total of four commercial office
buildings located in Seoul, Korea and Tokyo, Japan were selected
for field measurements. The concentration levels of the indoor
air pollutants were monitored at different outdoor intake rates
and the odor and discomfort ratings were made by the occupants
through questionnaire surveys.

Abstract: The office environment survey (Wilson and Hedge, 1987)
indicated that sick building syndrome was higher in all types
of public sector buildings compared to their private sector counterparts.
However, when public and private sectors occupied different floors
of the same building similar sickness rates were recorded. A public
sector organisation which occupied difference buildings, one naturally
ventilated, the other deep plan air conditioned had very different
sickness rates. In summary the authors (Wilson and Hedge, 1987)
concluded (Section 4.4) that: 'Further study on organisational
factors is certainly warranted....ultimately the quality of our
office stock reflects the policies and priorities of the organisations
occupying it'.

the assessment of Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) and ventilation systems
performance in buildings, with special attention to large enclosures.
There are subjective methods, in which human beings are the objects
of measurements or act as 'Sensors' themselves, and objective
ones, that is, methods making use of experimental apparatuses.
Attention is drawn on the last ones and particularly on the techniques
based on gaseous pollutant concentration monitoring. The main
IAQ and ventilation performance indicators are presented and their
measurement techniques are described. Full scale experiments results
illustrate the application of the above mentioned techniques.

Abstract: Ventilation systems may act as important sources of
impurities in indoor air if they become contaminated with dust
or micro-organisms. This may pollute the supply of air. Construction
debris and processing oil residues are commonly found to exist
even in the ventilation ducts of new buildings. The average surface
density of dust settled in the supply air ducts of 14 Finnish
office buildings was found to be 13.2 g/m2 and the average annual
accumulation rate 1.8 g/m2. It contained 80% of inorganic material.
The average count of viable fungal spores was 3370 cfu/g. IN the
present studies, the surface density of dust settled in ventilation
ducts of single family houses was investigated. The ducts and
other parts of the ventilation systems were cleaned, ventilation
was balanced and small faults observed were repaired. Air flow
rates were measured before and after cleaning and other service
measures.

Abstract: Simulation of air infiltration and ventilation, and
heat transfer processes of buildings are combined in this building
simulation program called BUS. A network assumption is adopted
for both air flow and thermal simulation. An iterative method
is used for air flow simulation, and a heat balance method is
selected for thermal simulation. The program includes mass balance,
momentum, and heat balance equations. This makes it possible to
take into consideration the interaction between ventilation and
heat transfer processes, obtain more reliable simulation results
than earlier, and simulate time-dependent processes.

Abstract: When the task is to control the indoor exposure, it
is important to know how persons are exposed to a contaminant
source. Personal exposure to a contaminant depends on the ventilation
and the location of the source relative to the person. Previous
studies have shown that the exposure may differ more than one
order of magnitude due to different velocity fields (Brohus and
Nielsen, 1994). This fact stresses the importance of taking this
parameter into account when we want to control the exposure and
develop guidelines for exposure reduction. The objective of this
study has been to determine the personal exposure to a contaminant
source in a uniform velocity field. This was done by full-scale
measurements and computer simulations. The results showed a significant
dependence on the velocity field both regarding the direction
and the magnitude. The results also showed that the disturbance
created by a person in a flow field may be a very important factor
to consider, when the person is turning the back to the flow field.
It was found that the wake created behind a person was able to
entrain contaminants from a distance exceeding the usual operation
range. Guidelines for personal exposure reduction in a uniform
velocity field are discussed.

Abstract: Ducts with orifices reinforced with perforated sheet
are used frequently in ventilation systems. Design works concerning
ventilation systems require the knowledge of how orifice geometry
influences the velocity distributions of air flow as well as the
knowledge of local resistance coefficient. Most often, designers
assume that, if the shape of duct remains unchanged, the principle
of uniform productivity or constant outflow velocity on the whole
orifice length and width can be accepted. In the course of investigations
on a number of ventilation elements, it has been observed that
the above approach was much simplified. The investigations were
carried out for both, laboratory conditions and real ventilation
systems. The above observation was reason to undertake experimental
research in order to state how the size and different geometry
of orifice, reinforced with perforated sheet, influence the area
of velocity of outflowing air and local resistance coefficient.
The orifice was located on side wall of ventilation duct with
rectangular cross-section. Orifice was the last ventilation element
in the duct.

Abstract: External air treatment cost in building climatization
plant can be a considerable quota of the global annual management
charges. The possibility to reduce this cost then assumes fundamental
importance also for healthy requirements. In fact it can make
more proposable exchange rates greater than minimum standard ones
fixed by low with a real improvement of internal comfort conditions.
In this case psychometric processes of outside air normally involve
remarkable energy consumption for humidification during winter,
for dehumidification in summer and sometimes in spring and autumn.
Various innovative plant solutions have been therefore proposed
for these applications. The introduction of desiccant systems
and evaporative cooling can permit techniques alternative to the
traditional ones both in air conditioning and heating periods.
In particular the convenience and sometimes the necessity to use
chemical dehumidification is just well-known in some application
cases characterized by low thermal or humidity levels required.
In this paper suitable combinations of these two fundamental processes
are proposed and their performances are investigated for building
climatization purposes. Performance comparison between these techniques
and traditional ones is carried on by annual simulation of building-plant
systems in dynamic conditions for different climatic situations.

Abstract: The loads of building deciding of the air flows and
change are of different character and mostly depend on stack and
wind effect. The main ways to gain information about air change
rate are measurements and computer simulations based on various
building models. Measurement method (tracer gas and pressurization
tests) cannot be applied in simultaneous of vast inner areas characteristic
of multizone structures. Therefore, analytical methods based on
mathematical models of buildings and processes taking place in
them are most frequently used. These models divide the building
into a given number of zones (spaces) mutually combined. In most
cases, the division of a building usually consists in separation
of buildings with natural ventilation and where wind effect is
predominant. However, the results of the calculation do not conform
to the results of measurements made in selected spaces of existing
buildings. On the basis of such comparisons it has been assumed
that the air flow and change rate taken as average for a flat
is rarely representative of each of rooms located in this flat.
This conclusion has become the basic reason to make an attempt
of creating a new method of air flow prediction.

Abstract: A great deal of research has not gone into many aspects
of the problem of indoor air quality but it has been almost exclusively
at the purely technical level. Some of the health effects of various
pollutants have been determined and measurements taken in the
field to determine whether guidelines are exceeded. In some cases
control of emissions from materials have been proposed or ventilation
rates recommended to reduce pollution levels. Supporting work
has been carried out on modelling of pollutant emissions and absorption
and so on. Some work has been carried out on the interaction of
IAQ and energy. Little consideration has been given to the concept
of IAQ as an economic good, inevitably in competition for scarce
resource with other goods. It is the purpose of this paper to
apply elementary economic concepts to the question of Indoor air
Quality and ventilation in dwellings. Scientists, engineers and
other technical people often feel a sense of frustration in that
their seemingly logical advice is not followed. Often this is
because they fail to appreciate the winder dimensions, one of
which is economic, within which policy makers have to operate.
The purpose of this paper is to try to widen the debate about
IAQ to include at least one other dimension besides the purely
technical one. The paper is essentially conceptual and attempts
to apply a range of economic concepts and techniques to the problem
of indoor air quality.

Abstract: The distribution and conditioning of the air are significant
cost factors in the operation of ventilation and air conditioning
systems. Plant operating hours are normally kept under control
by the use of time switches or by manual operation. In most cases,
However, these methods by no means exploit the full potential
for a reduction in operating hours. Compared with conventional
methods of control, a far more significant reduction in operating
costs can be achieved by basing air renewal on actual (measured)
demand. The additional capital investment can be recouped within
1 to 5 years, the payback period depending primarily on the air
flow rate. At an air flow rate of 2000 m3/h, the payback period
is approximately 5 years, and falls, with increasing air flow
rates, to as little as under a year. In automatic mode, the air
quality control system switches the fan stages on and off or,
in the case of VAV systems, adjusts the fan speed or damper position.
Demand-based ventilation systems are not just restricted to new
systems; cost-effective conversion kits are available for existing
systems. In a converted system, manual and/or time-switch control
are replaced by an air quality control system. Other analogue
or digital controls (such as temperature) remain unaffected. On
the basis of empirical values, preset as parameters in the controller,
demand-based ventilation systems can be started automatically
at the touch of a button.

of house dust mites exerts an influence upon the health of occupants.
Research has suggested that if house dust mite population is controlled,
then the incidence of asthma is reduced. The simplest way of achieving
this is to reduce indoor relative humidity levels. As part of
a continuing project (sponsored by the EATL Core Research Programme)
to compare the effectiveness of ventilation strategies in inhibiting
the growth of house dust mites, three ventilation systems were
installed in the EA Technology Ventilation Test House, and were
monitored over the winter of 1993/1994. Results are presented
for the variation in humidity levels between rooms for each ventilation
system. On the basis of the results obtained, mechanical ventilation
with heat recovery appears to be the most effective means of reducing
indoor humidity and in coping with peaks of moisture production.
When compared to passive stack ventilation, the heat recovery
capability of the mechanical system compensates for the associated
higher air change rates and the energy consumption associated
with fan operation.

<H3>INTRODUCTION</H3>
<P>
<FONT FACE="ARIAL">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Polymeric electrolyte gels immersed in an electrolyte solution deform under an electric field, therefore they are capable of transducing a stimulus into mechanical energy. Since the electromechanical phenomenon in synthetic polymer gels was first observed in 1982 by Tanaka et al. [1] several workers have been studying the volume changes and the deformation behavior of polymer gels in an electric field. Applications such as artificial muscles [2-5]actuators [6] and controlled drug delivery [7] for these gels have been explored. The polymers used are mostly random copolymer or polymer blends having acrylic acid or sulfonic acid pendant groups. The major problems with these polymers are their weak mechanic strength and long response times.<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this work, we studied the electromechanical behavior of an elastomeric hydrogel, heavily sulfonated styrene/ethylene/butylene/styrene triblock polymer [8] and showed that this material represents a new class of electro-response polymers.</FONT>
<P></P>
<H3>EXPERIMENTAL</H3>
<P>
<FONT FACE="ARIAL">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i><B>Materials:</B></i> Styrene/ethylene/butylene/styrene (Kraton G-1652) block copolymer was sulfonated using SO3/triethyl phosphate [8]. The level of sulfonation of the styrene blocks ranged from ca. 15 and 68 mol%.  Films of the sulfonic acid form were prepared as described elsewhere [8]. The dried films were about 0.2 mm in thickness and were neutralized in aqueous NaOH before being swollen in de-ionized water for at least two days.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i><B>Electromechanical Properties:</B></i> The gel was swollen in the appropriate solutions for more than 24 hours. The electrodes were platinum plates with dimensions of 25 x 30 mm and were 43 mm apart. One end of the gel film was attached to a piece of vinyl tubing that was placed midway between the electrodes. The gel and the electrode faces were parallel to each other and immersed in Na2SO4 solutions. A Lambda model LK342A FM regulated dc power supply was used to provide the voltage, which was between 5 and 35 V and corresponded to field strengths between 1 and 8 V/cm. The electromechanical response of the gel was observed using a CCD camera and recorded with a VCR. The bending profile with time was analyzed by a PC with <I>Optimas</I>, an image analysis software.
</FONT>
<P></P>
<H3>RESULTS &amp DISCUSSION</H3>
<P>
<FONT FACE="ARIAL">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i><B>Swelling Experiments:</B></i> The swelling ratios for different sulfonation levels are plotted in <A HREF="images/figure1.jpg"><B>Figure 1</B></A>. As anticipated, the gels swell more as the degree of sulfonation increases.  The swelling is apparently not linearly dependent on the degree of sulfonation, which is similar to what has been observed with PAMPS [9].<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i><B>Electromechanical Response:</B></i> When a dc field was applied, the gel bent toward the negative electrode, i.e., the cathode, which is consistent with other reports for polyanions such as PAMPS. The gel bending increased rapidly at beginning of applying the field and finally reached an equilibrium value. The degree of bending is dependent on the size of the gel, so throughout the experiments, the gel dimensions were kept constant as much as possible. <A HREF="images/figure2.jpg"><B>Figure 2</B></A> plots the equilibrium bending angles at different solution concentrations when we used the same gel and same applied field strength. A maximum bending at 0.02 M Na2SO4 was obtained. This is probably due to the following reasons. When the salt concentration is low, the osmotic pressure in the gel is high, and the osmotic pressure difference between the two sides of the gel, which is believed to be the driving force of the bending, is therefore also large, so the bending increases with a decrease in the Na2SO4 concentration. However, as the Na2SO4 concentration decreases, the conductivity of the solution also decreases and the voltage across the gel is lower since more and more voltage drop occurs between the solution and the electrodes. The concentration gradient is therefore lower. A maximum occurred at ~ 0.02 M Na2SO4 because of these two contradicting effects.
<p>	
<dd> The current as a function of sodium sulfate concentration is also shown in <A HREF="images/figure2.jpg"><B>Figure 2</B></A>. We also studied the speed of bending. Here we define the time that it takes the gel to bend to half of the equilibrium bending angle after the electric field was turned on as the response time and similarly, the time for the gel to relax to half of the equilibrium bending angle as the relaxation time. The response times were basically unchanged for all the sodium sulfate concentrations and the relaxation was faster at higher concentrations. That the response time did not change with the salt concentration indicated no fundamental difference in the bending mechanism between low and high sodium sulfate concentrations. <p>

<dd> Using the same gel and same salt solution, the gel bending as a function of voltage is plotted in <A HREF="images/figure3.jpg"><B>Figure 3</B></A>. Bending increased at the beginning with the voltage and eventually leveled off although the current continued to increase as voltage increased. A plot of the angle vs current indicated that they are not linearly related. The response time decreased with the increasing voltage, so the bending is faster at larger field, most likely due to the faster diffusion rate. The relaxation of the gel, on the other hand, remained unchanged.<p>
<dd> The bending for gels with different sulfonation levels is also plotted in <A HREF="images/figure1.jpg"><B>Figure 1</B></A>. As expected, the bending increased with the sulfonation level, but appeared to increased more sharply at higher sulfonation level. Both the response and relaxation times were essentially unchanged at different sulfonation levels.<p>
<dd> The gel swung when the polarity of the applied field alternated. <B><A HREF="images/figure4.jpg">Figure 4</A></B> is a typical response curve for a 50% sulfonated gel at 8 V/cm, in 0.02 M sodium sulfate solution. The bending reaches a maximum in about 2.5 seconds.</FONT>
<P></P>
<H3>CONCLUSIONS</H3><P> 
<FONT FACE="ARIAL">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have studied the swelling and electro-response of a new elastomeric hydrogel at different solution concentrations, degrees of sulfonation, and field strengths. The bending exhibited a maximum when the salt concentration was about 0.02 M Na2SO4. Bending was larger at higher sulfonation levels and higher field strengths although the bending tended to level off at higher field strengths. Further experiments are underway to optimize the response and to understand more about the bending mechanism.</FONT>

<FONT SIZE=3 FACE=ARIAL>The<I><B> DAIS Corporation</B></I>

was formed in April of 1993. The sole mission of the company

is to <I><B>develop new polymeric materials, and to use these new

materials to manufacture and market a line of low cost electrical

power sources</B></I>. DAIS is a business incubator company associated with <B>Rensselaer

Polytechnic Institute</B>, Troy, New York USA. Click <A HREF="http://www.rpi.edu/dept/incubator/homepage/" ><B>here</B></a> for more information on <B>Rensselaer's business Incubator program</B>.</FONT></A><P></P>

<LI><FONT SIZE=2 FACE=ARIAL><B>Developed a new ion conducting hydrocarbon 

based PEM membrane material. This material is known as the DAIS 585 Ionomer.<P></P>

<LI>Developed an electrode structure specifically engineered to work

with the DAIS 585 ion conducting membrane. The Membrane/Electrode Assembly (MEA)

is known as the DAIS POG.

<P></P>

<LI>Created two low cost housing structures designed for the DAIS POG. One 

design uses a passive air arrangement while the other uses an active air

design. Both are currently in proto-type stage. <P></P>

<LI>Filed and received a US Patent, and filed international patents

on the polymeric material discoveries<P></P>

<LI>Filed a <I><B>Continuation in Part</B></I> to the initial US Patent

adding additional data, applications, and support for the initial DAIS 585

patent filing.<P></P>

<LI>Received encouragement and support of new fuel cell technology from

experts at<I> <B>Los Alamos National Laboratory, the New York State Energy

Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA), and Giner, Inc.</B></I><P></P>

<H4><FONT FACE="Arial">A. Background </FONT></H4>

<P>

<FONT FACE="Arial">Electrical energy is produced by a fuel cell as if by magic for it has no moving parts and makes no noise. The secret behind the &quot;magic&quot; is to force a fuel (hydrogen) to produce electrical energy by means of a chemical reaction.</FONT>

<P>

<FONT FACE="Arial">Fuel cells are functionally superior to batteries because a fuel cell's lifetime limitation is the supply of the two things -- hydrogen and oxygen (which are called 'reactants' in technical jargon). </FONT>

<P>

<FONT FACE="Arial">Batteries by contrast have a defined lifetime, are heavy, have disposal restrictions, and may require extended periods of recharging before reuse. The fuel cell &quot;battery&quot; has four attractive features over existing power sources (including internal combustion engines):</FONT>

<UL>

<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">provides power as long as each cell has hydrogen and oxygen - no recharging required</FONT>

<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">a fuel cell 'stack' has no moving parts to wear out!</FONT>

<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">will produce energy at equal costs to existing forms of power (using the DAIS materials and technology this is now a true statement!).</FONT>

<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">it is absolutely noise-free</FONT>

<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">is &quot;environmentally friendly.&quot; </FONT>

</UL>

<H4><FONT FACE="Arial">B. History </FONT><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Arial">(what would a 'Primer&quot; be without a bit of history &#133;)</FONT>

</H4>

<P>

<FONT FACE="Arial">A bit of &quot;fuel cell&quot; history -- the first working fuel cell was produced by Sir William Grove in 1842. The technology advanced slowly over the years but took a giant leap in the 1960's. </FONT>

<P>

<FONT FACE="Arial">During the early 1960s General Electric produced the first practical application for a fuel cell when it provided on-board electrical power for the Gemini and Apollo space capsules. </FONT>

<P>

<FONT FACE="Arial">In the early 1970s, DuPont introduced the <I><B>Nafion&reg; </B></I>membrane from which all PEM fuel cells have traditional been constructed -- until now. Because Nafion&reg; based fuel cells (and similar membrane products from a handful of other manufacturers) is so expensive and requires a specialized environment (additional heat, compression, hydrated oxygen and hydrogen) to operate efficiently, fuel cells have not been affordable to the marketplace. </FONT>

<P>

<FONT FACE="Arial">The DAIS material 'inventions' are less expensive and do not require a 'specialized environment' in which to operate. These advances by DAIS make it cost effective to produce commercial devices that can now 'compete' with rechargeable batteries and internal combustion engines. <BR>

</H3>

<P>

<FONT FACE="Arial">The four steps to making the 'hardware' pieces described just above create electricity. These four steps are:<BR>

</FONT>

<P>

<B><FONT FACE="Arial">Step 1:</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial"> The chemical reaction starts when one side, the <I>anode </I>of each fuel cell, is exposed to the hydrogen fuel. The <I><B>anode</B></I> allows the hydrogen to give up its electrons and form a positively charged particle called a <I><B>proton</B></I>.</FONT>

<P>

<B><FONT FACE="Arial">Step 2:</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial"> On the opposite side of the cell, the cathode adsorbs oxygen from the air generating a potential which pulls the electrons through an external circuit to give them to the adsorbed oxygen. When the adsorbed oxygen receives two electrons it forms a negatively charged particle called an oxygen radical (no .. not left over hippies from the '60's!).</FONT>

<P>

<B><FONT FACE="Arial">Step 3:</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial"> . Now on each side of the membrane you have positive and negative charges that would like to come together. The <I><B>DAIS 585</B></I> membrane, acting as a &quot;one way valve&quot; that blocks electrons, hydrogen gas, oxygen gas, and oxygen radicals - allows only the positively charged protons to diffuse through the membrane.</FONT>

<P>

<B><FONT FACE="Arial">Step 4:</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial"> When two positively charged protons encounter a negatively charged oxygen radical they join together to form water. The <I><B>cathode</B></I> expels the water and the adsorbs more oxygen to start the reaction all over again.</FONT>

<P>

<CENTER><BLINK><I><B><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=#FF0000 FACE="Arial">That is it!</BLINK><I><B> 

<BR>

<BR>

</B></I></FONT></B></I></CENTER>

<P>

<FONT FACE="Arial">The &quot;real beauty&quot; of the fuel cell is that it is so simple in operation. There are no moving parts. Only water and a little waste heat are the by-products of making electricity. 

</FONT>

<HR>

<H3><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=#FF0000 FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">IV. Conclusion(s) -- with <STRONG>three</STRONG> cool pictures:<BR>

</FONT></H3>

<P>

<FONT FACE="Arial">Each fuel cell will generate an electrical potential of up to 1.1 volts depending on how much electrical current it is asked to produce (by the <I><B>load</B></I> or the device requesting power). </FONT>

<P>

<FONT FACE="Arial">Higher voltages can be created by arranging cells together--similar to connecting several batteries together inside a flashlight.</FONT>

<P>

<FONT FACE="Arial">A collection of individual cells is called a <I><B>stack</B></I>. The amount of electrical current a cell can produce is proportional to the total area of the cell. For example the greater the area of the cell the more current at a given voltage that can be produced.</FONT>

<P>

<FONT FACE="Arial">Thus a fuel cell <I><B>stack</B></I> can produce any required amount of electrical potential and current by stacking the proper numbers of cells with each cell having a specific area or size.<BR>

</FONT>

<P>

<FONT FACE="Arial">Ok .. now that you are a fuel cell expert .. what are those clever folks at DAIS up to? </FONT>

<P>

<FONT FACE="Arial">The DAIS team is working on producing production ready prototypes of three sizes -- a 25w, a 125w, and a 1kW unit. Each unit uses the novel DAIS membrane and electrode materials (the DAIS POG), and proprietary stack design(s). <BR>

</FONT>

<P>

<FONT FACE="Arial">The pictures below are of three DAIS &quot;PowerCell&quot; fuel cell stacks.</FONT>

<P>

</P><FONT FACE="Arial">The 8W <EM>&quot;PowerCell&quot;</EM> and the 20W <EM>&quot;PowerCell&quot;</EM> unit are powering a Coleman two tube lantern. The 50W unit is powering a Coleman Thermoelectric Cooler <SMALL>(cooler not shown)</SMALL>.</FONT>

<FONT FACE="ARIAL">Over the course of the past two years the DAIS team has received many requests for information. Most of the requests are the same .. hence the creation of this <FONT COLOR="#008000" FACE="ARIAL"><B>Frequently-Asked-Questions (FAQ)</B></FONT> section.</FONT><P></P>
 
<FONT FACE="ARIAL">The product name for a DAIS fuel cell stack is <FONT COLOR="#0080C0" FACE="ARIAL"><B>"PowerCell"</B></FONT>. Any reference below to <FONT COLOR="#0080C0" FACE="ARIAL"><B>"PowerCell"</B></FONT> is talking about the combined DAIS technologies  materials and stack design.</FONT><P></P>
 
<FONT FACE="ARIAL">Here are some other terms for you to know before continuing on:</FONT><P></P>
 
<B><FONT COLOR="#008000" FACE="ARIAL"><b><I>DAIS</I></b> 585 Membrane : </FONT></B><FONT FACE="ARIAL"> This is the core invention of the DAIS Corporation. This hydrocarbon based membrane (see the <A HREF="products.htm"><B>Products section</B></A> for a more detailed description) can be used in fuel cell applications without some of the traditional fuel cell requirements. A piece of DAIS 585 membrane is sandwiched in between two electrodes to form a POG.</FONT><P></P>

<B><FONT COLOR="#008000" FACE="ARIAL"><b><I>DAIS</I></b> POG : </FONT></B> <FONT FACE="ARIAL"> This is the electrode (cathode), DAIS 585 Membrane, electrode (anode) sandwich talked about in the "<A HREF="fuel.htm"><B>What is A Fuel Cell</B></A>" (click on link) section.</FONT><P></P>

<FONT FACE="ARIAL">The traditional fuel cell folks refer to this as a Membrane/Electrode assembly. Like any number of other things DAIS is different! A DAIS POG is entirely made of  new materials developed by DAIS.</FONT><P></P>

<B><FONT COLOR="#804040" FACE="ARIAL">Stack : </font></B><FONT FACE="ARIAL"> A collection of <B>POG</B>s stacked together. The purpose of a stack is to mechanically affix each individual POG to gather its electrical potential and for even gas distribution.</font><P></P>

<FONT COLOR="#804040" FACE="ARIAL"><B>Unit : </B></FONT><FONT FACE="ARIAL"> A unit is a stack contained in an integrated housing. This integrated housing has a gas distribution system, and some simple controls. This is the final product.</FONT><P></P>
 
<FONT FACE="ARIAL">Is this a fully-exhaustive list of possible definitions or questions? No. This section is meant to hopefully address the most popular questions of a person getting familiar with this exciting technology.</FONT>
 
<FONT FACE="ARIAL">Do you have a question that you would like answered or added to this section? If so please send us a message: click here <A HREF="mailto:faq@dais.net"><B>faq@dais.net</B></A></FONT><P></P>
 
<B><FONT COLOR="#804000" FACE="ARIAL">1.  How much does a DAIS "PowerCell" weigh ? </FONT></B><P></P>
 
<FONT FACE="ARIAL">Each POG (a PowerCell is made up of multiple POGS stacked together in a housing) weighs approximately 2 ounces (or approximately 60 grams). Each PowerCell has a housing that will vary in weight with the number of POGS it will contain. A 10W PowerCell (stack housing and POGS ) will weigh approximately 1.5 lb. (approximately .65 kg.). These numbers do not include the hydrogen fuel tank, regulator, or valve. DAIS is using a custom designed gas distribution arrangement. This gas distribution system weighs approximately 2 lb. (.90 kg.). The total weight of a 10W PowerCell is approximately 3.75 lb. (this number is rounded up a bit). </FONT><P></P>
 
<FONT COLOR="#804000" FACE="ARIAL"><B>2.  How much fuel does a <I><FONT COLOR="#008000" FACE="ARIAL">DAIS</FONT></I> <FONT COLOR="#0080C0" FACE="ARIAL">"PowerCell"</FONT> consume?<BR>What kind of fuel does the PowerCell use ?<BR>What is the efficiency of a DAIS stack ? </B></FONT><P></P>
 
<FONT FACE="ARIAL">At  30 degrees C in air, 7/10V per POG in a Stack of 12 POGS using a 40L sized hydrogen tank (2,200 PSI) flowing gas at 2 PSI and 3/10L per minute the run time is approximately 12 continuous hours.</FONT><P></P>
 
<FONT COLOR="#804000" FACE="ARIAL"><B>3.  What is the required maintenance of the PowerCell ?</B></FONT><P></P>

<FONT FACE="ARIAL">Talk nicely to it! OK, so that is not the technical answer you are looking for ..sorry. The actual answer is to keep the unit clean or free of any dirt build up  (remember the PowerCell needs to breathe  -- very much like you and I do). Please do not expose the unit to high temperatures (greater than 100 degrees F&#176;), open flame, or freezing temperatures (for our current version, today we are working on a low-temperature model). Please keep the unit in its protective sack when not in use. That is it. The PowerCell is really durable and can take a great deal of punishment. But ... do keep it clean!</FONT><P></P>
 
<B><FONT COLOR="#804000" FACE="ARIAL">4.  Operating environment of the DAIS fuel cell stack ?</FONT></B><P></P>
 
<FONT FACE="ARIAL">The <FONT COLOR="#008000" FACE="ARIAL"><B><b><I>DAIS</I></b> PowerCell</B></FONT> is designed to run at ambient temperatures (0 to 40 degrees C), at normal atmospheric pressures, and without any additional treatment (hydration) of the hydrogen gas stream. The unit is either air breathing or uses a forced air scheme.</FONT><P></P>
 
<B><FONT COLOR="#804000" FACE="ARIAL">5.  Projected lifetime of the stack?<BR>Refurbish v. trash ?</FONT></B><P></P>
 
<FONT FACE="ARIAL">The lifetime of the PowerCell is broken into two answers. The lifetime of the POG materials is approximately 2,500 hours of continuous use at maximum rated power density. The lifetime of the housing and gas distribution system is the same as glass, i.e. if it is not broken it will work meaning there is no technical lifetime limitation.</FONT><P></P>
 
<FONT FACE="ARIAL">A unique feature of the PowerCell is that after the rated lifetime of the POG materials is reached  the unit can be refurbished for another 2,500 hours of use. How you do that, and what it will cost is being developed (sorry not to have a better answer right now ..send us a note to say your are interested in getting knowing more about this refurbishment program).</FONT><P></P>
 
<FONT  COLOR="#804000" FACE="ARIAL"><B>6.  Dimensions of the PowerCell ?</B></FONT><P></P>

<FONT FACE="ARIAL">The initial PowerCell is a 10W unit that is approximately 5" long by 3" wide, and 3" tall. In its system enclosure (stack and gas distribution system in an enclosure) the overall measurements climb to approximately 6" long, 5" wide, and 3.5" tall. </FONT><P></P>
 
<B><FONT COLOR="#804000" FACE="ARIAL">7. What are the applications for a DAIS PowerCell ?</FONT></B><P></P>

<FONT FACE="ARIAL">Let your mind run wild on this one. Some of the coolest applications we probably havent even thought of yet! The finest attributes of the PowerCell technology lend it to any application that requires a stable, noiseless power source for long run time(s). What are some of the applications the DAIS team is aggressively pursuing? Any number of recreation, communication, power equipment, and small transportation uses. Have a cool idea to use a DAIS PowerCell? Send it to us ... we use it ... we give you a PowerCell! Click here <A HREF="mailto:contest@dais.net"><B>contest@dais.net</B></A></FONT><P></P>

<B><FONT COLOR="#804000" FACE="ARIAL">8.  Are any of the materials that go into a DAIS PowerCell harmful to your health or the environment ?</FONT></B><P></P>

<FONT FACE="ARIAL">The DAIS PowerCell is made of plastics, light weight metal or aluminum, and contains no hazardous materials. </FONT><P></P>

<B><FONT COLOR="#804000" FACE="ARIAL">9. Where do I get hydrogen ?<BR>Is hydrogen safe ?</FONT></B><P></P>

<FONT FACE="ARIAL">These are two really great questions. Hydrogen is available from mail order sources OR best sourced locally at welding or industrial gas distributors. The cost to refill the small 40 Liter sized tank DAIS uses with the PowerCell is less than $2.00 USD (based on U.S. hydrogen prices)</FONT>.<P></P>

<FONT FACE="ARIAL">Using hydrogen, or gasoline, or propane requires taking some safety precautions. Each gas can be dangerous if mishandled.</FONT><P></P>

<FONT FACE="ARIAL">The safety of hydrogen is a constant question. Handling hydrogen is safer than handling gasoline or propane. Why? Hydrogen is a light gas  it evaporates into the air 8 times quicker (University of Florida - Miami study funded by the Department of Energy in 1995) than gasoline or propane vapors. Because hydrogen disperses quickly the danger from a concentrated amount of the hydrogen gas is low. </FONT><P></P>

<FONT FACE="ARIAL">This area of hydrogen safety will be a real learning experience for many people. The findings of the DAIS team on this matter is that perception is reality. Frankly  before working on this project, seeing how safe using hydrogen is (following simple, known safety measures), and using the gas I personally had a large misunderstanding about hydrogen. Let me end this very very short discussion by saying that in the coming months DAIS will add links to other sites that will answer this question of hydrogen safety to your satisfaction. </FONT><P></P>

<FONT FACE="ARIAL">OK - so that is the FAQ section. What did we forget? What dont you like? What did you like? Please ... tell us! Click <A HREF="feed.htm"><B>here</B></A>.</FONT><P></P>

<H3>ABSTRACT</H3>
<P>
<FONT FACE="ARIAL">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Significant market opportunities exist for affordable, air-breathing fuel cells operating at ambient temperature.  Toward that end, we have developed new, low-cost materials that have the requisite performance characteristics to adequately address many projected applications.</FONT><P></P> 

<FONT FACE="ARIAL">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Styrene-ethylene/butylene-styrene triblock polymer (Kraton G1650) has been partially sulfonated and successfully employed as a PEM in hydrogen fuel cells.  These materials has several attractive characteristics, including high proton conductivity (ca. 0.09-0.10 S/cm when fully hydrated), good mechanical properties, and relatively low cost.  However, their hydrocarbon nature required the development of electrodes which can be readily bonded to the membranes and that offer good performance at room temperature.  We briefly review market opportunities for low-cost fuel cells and summarize our most recent efforts in the development of these devices.</FONT><P></P>

<H3>1.0 INTRODUCTION</H3>
<P>
<FONT FACE="ARIAL">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a growing sentiment that the greatest limitation to widespread utilization of fuel cells is cost, and much recent attention is being directed toward economic issues including raw materials and manufacturing costs.  These are particularly important in view of the tremendous opportunities for fuel cells in various consumer applications, where costs must be relatively low in order to encourage adoption as an alternative to batteries or portable, gasoline-powered generators.  Performance is of course a key issue as well, and many consumer applications will not tolerate cell operating much above ambient or any need for compressed air or oxygen.  Toward this end, we have focused on the development of low-cost fuel cells which operate at or near room temperature utilizing ambient air as the source of oxygen for the cathode reaction.  We review here our rationale for this focus and summarize recent progress in materials research and development.</FONT><P></P>

<H3>2.0 MARKET OPPORTUNITIES</H3>
<P>
<FONT FACE="ARIAL">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Historically, fuel cell development has been directed toward high  reliability/high cost systems, such as the NASA space missions of the 1960s. Maximized performance is paramount for such uses.  Consequently, the materials, control systems, and designs have reflected this bias and are in many cases over-designed for cost-sensitive commercial applications. There is an urgent need in the public sector for economical fuel cells to serve as alternatives to internal combustion engines or to provide sources  of extended portable power. By necessity, the design objectives  of fuel cell development have changed from high performance/high cost to a more down-to-earth focus on high reliability/low cost in order to become cost competitive for specific applications.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="ARIAL">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1993, the DAIS Corporation was founded to address the materials aspects of fuel cell technology. The emphasis was placed on developing a set of materials that could eliminate the compromises of the existing forms of power generation while tailoring the materials to commercial application(s). The benefits of fuel cell technology have long been out of reach for commercial, military, or consumer use. The primary reasons have been the  cost of the materials, and the resulting physical designs required to make the technology work have proved unable to make the grade for popular marketplace acceptance.  The DAIS Corporation has examined the cost-to-application needs of PEM fuel cells. Each element of this technology has been analyzed from the perspective of cost, manufacturing, and application. DAIS has invented new, lower cost, functional materials including a new hydrocarbon-based membrane, a stable electrode assembly, a novel electrode/electrolyte interface polymer, and two advanced stack designs. These new materials and stack/housing designs form the basis for an applications priced method of electrical power generation. This technology will initially be aimed at the appliance marketplace of 1kW and under.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="ARIAL">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The primary target market for these PEM fuel cell innovations is in the portable power source arena. Applications abound, including outdoor recreational products, domestic emergency power devices, portable power supplies for military personnel, trades-person tool and site power, and portable equipment power supplies.  A second market for the PEM fuel cell technology is manufacturers of products that use small engines (i.e. all sorts of outdoor power equipment, portable generators, small transportation uses, and marine applications).</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="ARIAL">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any new power generation approach has to address not only the perceived negatives but include the strengths of the existing technology. Given the 100-plus year infrastructure build-up for battery and internal combustion technology,  the first issue a new technology would need to address is cost competitiveness.  Consumer studies have repeatedly shown that new technology generally can charge an incremental premium given an easily perceived increase in value or functionality<SUP><B>1</B></SUP>.  With this in mind, and recognizing the compromise issues outlined above,  the conclusion can be drawn  that a new form of power-producing technology needs to include the following attributes outlined in Table 1.</font><P></P>

It has been proposed that Nafion possesses an inverted micellar structure, with spherical (ca. 40-50 Å diameter) clusters lined with sulfonic acid groups which are interconnected via ca. 10Å channels <SUP><B>3-5</B></SUP>. We elected to sulfonate Kraton G1650, a commercially available styrene/ethylene-butylene/styrene triblock polymer, as it contains a saturated carbon center block which should be inert to the sulfonation reaction<SUP><B>6,7</B></SUP>.  The structure of the polymer is shown in Figure 1.</FONT>

<FONT FACE="ARIAL">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transmission electron microscopy of cast films reveals distinct, phase-separated structures which appeared to be comprised of cylinders of partially sulfonated polystyrene blocks<SUP><B>6</B></SUP>, although more recent micrographs of thin cross-sections are suggestive of a lamellar structure with thicknesses in the range of 250-300Å.  It is known that the morphologies of block copolymers can be altered depending on whether the solvent is preferential for one of the blocks<SUP><B>8</B></SUP>.  Our typical casting solvent is rich in n-propanol, which should preferentially solvate the sulfonated styrene blocks, and perhaps subtle changes in the solvent evaporation rate can lead to different final morphologies.  Regardless, we find that the fully hydrated (i.e., sample immersed in water) proton conductivities are readily reproducible at a constant sulfonation level, suggestion that upon water swelling the sulfonated styrene domains are interconnected.  In fact, the conductivities at sulfonation levels above ca. 50 mole% of styrene units exceed that of Nafion under similar measurement conditions.  The preferred extent of sulfonation is ca. 60%, affording a good balance of electrical and mechanical properties.</FONT><P></P>

<FONT FACE="ARIAL">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chemical stability of hydrocarbon-based materials will be poorer than that of perfluorinated polymers such as Nafion due to lower C-H bond dissociation enthalpies. The key step in oxidative degradation is atom abstraction from the backbone (most likely tertiary benzylic H in styrenic polymers) by, for example, electro-generated hydroperoxy radicals. As is well known from studies of autoxidation of hydrocarbons<SUP><B>9</B></SUP> the resulting polymer radicals can react with molecular oxygen to form peroxy radicals, and ensuing abstraction and cleavage chemistry eventually leads to backbone scission.  The longevity of a hydrocarbon-based PEM is dependent on the relative kinetics of electrode reactions which consume free radical intermediates on the way to product water vs. hydrogen atom abstraction on the polymer by the intermediates.  This is difficult to quantify, but we believed that PEM degradation would be minimized by fuel cell operation at relatively low temperatures.  A predicted lifetime, approximated from reactions of our PEM material in dilute hydrogen peroxide, is about 2500 h at ca. 60<SUP><B>o</B></SUP>C<SUP><B>10</B></SUP> and is likely to be significantly longer near room temperature.  Therefore, we conclude that the sulfonated block polymer stability is in excess of that necessary for many low-temperature fuel cell applications.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="ARIAL">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We note that the sulfonated triblock copolymer has other interesting properties.   For example, numerous redox-active molecules may be ion-exchanged into the films, and thus the polymers are useful as coatings for chemically modified electrodes<SUP><B>11</B></SUP>. Also, the polymers are relatively compliant hydrogels, and we discovered that they deform readily in modest electric fields when suspended in aqueous salt solutions, exhibiting a swinging (bending) motion toward the cathode with a response time of about 2 sec. <SUP><B>12</B></SUP>.</FONT>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="ARIAL">3.2 ELECTRODES</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<FONT FACE="ARIAL">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fuel cell electrodes are multi-functional materials which must meet several important criteria, including (i)  good catalyst activity at low temperatures while minimizing the amount of expensive noble metal, (ii) high porosity to allow efficient transport of oxygen to the cathode, especially when air (21% O<SUP><B>2</B></SUP>) is used, (iii) good ionic conductivity at the electrode/membrane interface, and (iv) hydrophobicity in the vicinity of the catalyst to encourage water rejection to prevent flooding with attendant inhibition of gas transport.  Important features of efficient, and therefore practical, fuel cell electrodes for various consumer applications noted earlier are (1) the ability to  employ ambient air as the oxygen source; (2) that it be efficient at ambient temperature and pressure, i.e. that it not require external heating or pressurization; and (3) that it operate without external humidification of gases.</FONT><P></P>

<FONT FACE="ARIAL">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commercial electrodes are not economically viable and do not bond well to hydrocarbon-based PEMs, and  thus we needed to develop porous gas diffusion electrodes that met all of these requirements.  Our performance goal under these conditions is roughly 150 mW/cm<SUP><B>2</B></SUP> of electrode area, although this has been exceeded recently.  This is specifically for a cell or stack operating at the desired voltage at or slightly above room temperature.  Our approach involves the use of Pt/C as the catalyst layer with a sulfonated hydrocarbon polymer interface coating to promote adhesion between the electrodes and the PEM. A conductive, porous cloth which has been rendered hydrophobic comprises the backing layer, which economically combines good breathability for oxygen with good water rejection.</FONT><P></P>

<FONT FACE="ARIAL">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Figure 2 shows a current-voltage plot of an MEA prepared using the sulfonated block polymer PEM and our electrodes.  A flow-through cell was employed which consisted of graphite blocks which had machined into them an interdigitated, serpentine flow pattern. The oxygen source for the cathode was compressed air and the anode was commercial grade hydrogen, both gases being at atmospheric pressure and without humidification. The platinum loading of both the anode and cathode was approximately 0.5 mg/cm<SUP><B>2</B></SUP>. The cell was run using approximately twice the necessary stoichiometric flow at peak power. The cell temperature was 40<SUP><B>o</B></SUP>C. The main feature of the curve is the high open circuit on air of approximately 0.94 V and the power at 0.5 V of about 200 mW/cm<SUP><B>2</B></SUP>.</FONT><P></P>

<FONT FACE="ARIAL">3.3 PEM FUEL CELL STACKS</FONT><P></P>

<FONT FACE="ARIAL">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stack designs will support both active and passive cell operation with the emphasis placed on the use of low-cost materials (e.g current collectors, flow fields, end plates, etc.) which are simple and inexpensive to fabricate. Compact, lightweight units will afford high volumetric and mass energy densities as well as high packing efficiencies. Complete fuel cell stack systems are being constructed which meet these criteria.</FONT><P></P>

<H3>4.0 SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK</H3>
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="ARIAL">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A significant opportunity exists for fuel cell technology in power applications of 1kW and under.  However, a key limitation is cost, and our efforts have concentrated on economical materials and designs to meet this projected need.  The search for low-cost fuel cells represents an exciting interdisciplinary effort which merges science, engineering and business and which may have important technological implications.</FONT><P></P>

<H3><FONT FACE="ARIAL">Executive Summary</FONT></H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="ARIAL">There are many power producing products available on the market  today. Batteries and internal combustion engines are foremost among  these products. Both batteries and internal combustion engines have an established infra-structure, are priced to fit diverse applications, and are readily available. The disadvantages  of these traditional products revolve around  practical limitations and environmental issues. Fuel cell technology has the ability to magnify  the positive aspects of these existing products while overcoming the practical and environmental challenges.</FONT><P></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="ARIAL">Historically, fuel cell development has been directed toward high  reliability/high cost systems, such as the NASA  space missions of the 1960s. Maximized performance is paramount for such uses.  Consequently, the materials, control systems, and designs have reflected this bias and are in many cases over-designed for cost-sensitive commercial applications. There is an urgent need in the public sector for economic fuel cells to serve as alternatives to internal combustion engines or to provide sources  of longer portable power. By necessity, the design objectives  of fuel cell development have  changed from high performance/high cost to a more down-to-earth focus on high reliability/low cost in order to become cost competitive for specific applications.</FONT><P></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="ARIAL">Beginning with the principle  of cost by application,' the DAIS Corporation has developed a series of new proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell materials. These materials include (1) a new membrane, (2) a cost effective electrode structure engineered for use with the membrane, (3) an interface polymer to mate the membrane and electrode, and (4) two novel "stack" or housing designs that make best use of the novel materials.</FONT> <P></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="ARIAL">The primary target market for these  PEM fuel cell innovations is in the portable power source arena. Applications abound, including outdoor recreational products, domestic emergency power devices, portable power supplies for military personnel, trades-person tool and site power, and portable equipment power supplies.  A  second market for the PEM fuel cell technology is manufacturers of products that use small engines (i.e. all sorts of outdoor power equipment, portable generators, small transportation uses, marine applications, and solar hydrogen hybrids).</FONT><P></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="ARIAL">DAISs fuel cell technology possesses several advantages over existing battery technologies in terms of weight, energy density, unit lifetime, and cost.</FONT><P></P>

<FONT FACE="ARIAL">Given this unique forums mission statement of "The Dawn of Commercialization," it is DAISs intention to present a brief summary  of these technical advances,  and indicate how these novel materials assembled in a fuel cell will impact the marketplace acceptance of fuel cell technology.</FONT><P></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><FONT FACE="ARIAL">I. Forms of Power</FONT></H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="ARIAL">There are many power producing products available on the market  today. Batteries and internal combustion engines comprise the majority  of these products.</FONT><P></P> 

<FONT FACE="ARIAL">Many products that use batteries are standardized  to accept the traditional AA, AAA, C, D, or automobile sized batteries. In 1995 there were over 5.3 billion dry cell batteries (of all types) alone sold worldwide<SUP>2</SUP>.  There are over 62,000 gasoline retailers in the US<SUP>3</SUP>. This is a large established infrastructure for obtaining the required fuel for internal combustion engine applications.</FONT><P></P>  

<FONT FACE="ARIAL">A grocery store in Minot, North Dakota can sell "AA" sized batteries for approximately the same cost as a similar store in Florence, Italy. This speaks to the accepted form factor of "AA" batteries, and of the relative price acceptance of the batterys functionality. An Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) in Troy, NY uses a 5hp, 4 cycle engine that costs approximately $155 per unit to power its line of outdoor power equipment. This is the same unit that a firm in Moline, Illinois would use to power its line of outdoor equipment. People have accepted the design, the availability, the costs , the upkeep, the risks, and the compromises and undesirable aspects of the two primary forms of power.</FONT><P></P>

<FONT FACE="ARIAL">The point is that  major forms of power in the world today are an outgrowth of over 100 years of product and technology evolution. This evolution has accepted the compromises of the given technology.</FONT> <P></P>

<FONT FACE="ARIAL">And certainly these  products are not without deficiency and compromise. The very definition of compromise is the lack of features or functionality that the entire marketplace has had to accept.</FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="ARIAL">In todays battery powered technology these compromises are:</FONT>
   <UL>
   <LI><FONT FACE="ARIAL">weight</FONT>
   <LI><FONT FACE="ARIAL">environmental disposal</FONT>
   <LI><FONT FACE="ARIAL">lifetime</FONT>
</UL>

<FONT FACE="ARIAL">A minimal set of compromises for the internal combustion engine include:</FONT>

   <LI><FONT FACE="ARIAL">weight</FONT>
   <LI><FONT FACE="ARIAL">environmental damage</FONT>
   <LI><FONT FACE="ARIAL">efficiency of operation</FONT>
</UL></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="ARIAL">Any new power generation approach  has to address not only the perceived negatives but include the strengths of the existing technology. Given the 100 plus year infrastructure build up for battery and internal combustion technology,  the first issue a new technology would need to address is cost competitiveness.</FONT><P></P>

<FONT FACE="ARIAL">Consumer studies have repeatedly shown that new technology generally can charge an incremental premium given an easily perceived increase in value or functionality <SUP>4</SUP>.</FONT><P></P>

<FONT FACE="ARIAL">With this in mind,  and recognizing the compromise issues outlined above,  the conclusion can be drawn that a new form of power producing technology needs to include the following attributes:</FONT><P></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="ARIAL">Fuel cell technology has the ability to meet  these  new technology attributes. Fuel cells possess the necessary characteristics to excel as power source in the next wave of technology.</FONT><P></P></BLOCKQUOTE>


<H3><FONT FACE="ARIAL">II. History that leads to the Future</FONT></H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="ARIAL">Fuel cell development, since the NASA missions of the 1960s, has focused on high reliability, high cost systems. Consequently, the materials, control systems, and designs have reflected this bias and are in many cases over-designed for cost-sensitive commercial applications. DAIS has adopted the strategy  that in order to compete against traditional forms of power generation fuel cell technology must have high reliability and be priced to address the application.</FONT><P></P>

<FONT FACE="ARIAL">Historically fuel cell technology has been priced at approximately $8 per Watt. What is behind this sky-high expense?  Quite simply, the  cost of the materials forced a need to obtain the highest power output possible. Engineers and scientists added gas hydration, compression, and heat. These ancillary devices, coupled with the basic cost of the materials have produced a situation that violates Required Attribute #1 stated above: staying within 7% of existing power production methods.</FONT><P></P>

<FONT FACE="ARIAL">In 1993, the DAIS Corporation formed to address the materials aspect of this technology. The emphasis was placed on developing a set of materials that could eliminate  the compromises of the existing forms of power generation while tailoring the materials to commercial application(s). As an example:</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

   <UL>
   <LI><FONT FACE="ARIAL">the average lifetime of a lawnmower powered by a 5hp internal combustion engine in the US is 455 hours.<SUP>6</SUP></FONT> 
   <LI><FONT FACE="ARIAL">the average lifetime of a 125cc Scooter in Europe is 1890 hours.<SUP>7</SUP></FONT> 
   <LI><FONT FACE="ARIAL">the average lifetime of a 6v lantern battery running a Coleman 7300 series camping lantern is 8.5 hours.<SUP>8</SUP></FONT> 
</UL>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="ARIAL">By comparison the DAIS materials all have a rated life that exceeds each application lifetime stated above. Traditional fuel cells have longer lifetimes, and (using the ancillary equipment) higher power densities per cell. This existing technology again violates the first principle of marketplace acceptance - the costs are too high to create an upsurge  of support.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>


<H3><FONT FACE="ARIAL">III. The DAIS Materials</FONT></H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="ARIAL">The DAIS materials have been engineered  to run in the following operational environment:</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="ARIAL">The DAIS membrane material (known as <EM>DAIS 585</EM>) is a sulfonated styrene/ethylene-butylene/styrene triblock copolymer. The material is an elastic, hydrocarbon-based hydrogel with cation exchange ability, and good optical transparency. The block copolymer contains approximately 29% wt styrene units. Sulfonation levels (based on styrene units) range from ca.15-60%. Water uptake and extent of swelling depend on the sulfonation level.</FONT><P></P>

<FONT FACE="ARIAL">Cast films in the acid (H+) forms have ionic conductivity's (when fully hydrated) of greater than 9 x 10-2 S/cm, which are comparable to those of the fluoropolymer Nafion®. Numerous derivatives with different cations, including many that are redox-active, are readily prepared from the parent polymer</FONT>.<P></P>

<FONT FACE="ARIAL">The material is available at sulfonation levels of 55%-60% as a pre-cast reinforced film (approximate thicknesses of 50 - 200 micron) or as a solution in alcohol (either 5% or 10% solids).</FONT><P></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="ARIAL">The DAIS electrode is a porous gas diffusion electrode comprised  of (a) an electronically conductive porous body in electrical contact with (b) a catalyst layer that in turn consists of  (i) a catalyst dispersed on the surface of a carbon support; (ii) a water-insoluble sulfonated polystyrene, sulfonated poly(a-methylstyrene) or sulfonated styrene-ethylene-butylene-styrene (SEBS) block copolymer; and (iii) a nonionic fluorocarbon polymer.</FONT><P></P>

<FONT FACE="ARIAL">The preferred sulfonated polystyrenes, poly(a-methylstyrene)s and SEBS's have a conductivity of 0.04 S/cm or greater, a molecular weight from 30,000 to 1,000,000, and are 10 to 60 mole percent sulfonated.

<H4><FONT FACE="ARIAL">C.  The DAIS "PowerCell" Stack Designs <SUP>9</SUP>:</FONT></H4>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="ARIAL">Traditional stack housing designs require peripheral support devices (compressors, heaters, water inlet/outlet, etc.) to yield high electrical current. The housings tended to be constructed of a block- style heavy gauge stainless steel metal with individual cell components made of a graphite-like (or filled) composite material. </FONT><P></P>

<FONT FACE="ARIAL">By way of contrast -- the DAIS  fuel cell housing designs (Radial Air Stack  RAS, and Single In Line Module  SIM) provide special  air and hydrogen flows, and successfully manage the water produced by the fuel cells electrochemical reaction.  The base materials are made of engineering grade plastics. The Radial Air design is unique  due to its air flow pattern and use of a single compression bolt along with external hydrogen fuel distribution manifolds. The SIM design is progressive in regards  to the ease of parts  fabrication, low cost, and active material protection. Each design is lightweight, and is specifically targeted to be used in portable or semi-portable consumer, commercial, or military applications.</FONT><P></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="ARIAL">Both novel housing designs (RAS and SIM) are engineered for use with the DAIS Corporations patented (or patent pending) Proton Exchange Membrane based fuel cell materials (membrane electrolyte, anode cathode, backing material, and interface polymer). Furthermore , it is possible to combine the best aspects of each design into a single design that is far superior to either design alone.</FONT> <P></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="ARIAL">Both designs can be either passive or active air flow managed. The use of the passive mode makes a less expensive PowerCell device. Adding the active air flow over the cathode generally produces a 3x improvement in the overall power density. Each air management scheme can be adapted  to a specific  application or price point.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="ARIAL">The benefits of fuel cell technology have long been out of reach for commercial, military, or consumer use. The primary reasons have been the  cost of the materials, and the resulting physical designs required to make the technology work have proved unable to make the grade for popular marketplace acceptance.</FONT><P></P><BR>

<FONT FACE="ARIAL">The DAIS Corporation has examined the cost-to-application needs of this exciting technology of Proton Exchange Membrane fuel cells. Each element of this technology has been analyzed from the perspective of cost, manufacturing, and application. DAIS has invented new, lower cost, functional materials including a new hydrocarbon based membrane, a stable electrode assembly, a novel interface polymer, and two advanced  stack designs.</FONT><P></P>

<FONT FACE="ARIAL">These new materials and stack/housing designs form the basis for an applications priced method of electrical power generation. This technology will initially be aimed at the appliance marketplace of 1kW and under.<P></P></FONT>

<H3>ABSTRACT</H3>
<P>
<FONT FACE="ARIAL">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commercially available styrene-ethylene/butylene-styrene triblock polymer (Kraton G1652) was partially sulfonated using a SO3/triethyl
phosphate reagent in a dichloroethane/cyclohexane mixed solvent.
Films of the product were cast from lower alcohols to give elastic
materials with different degrees of sulfonation (ca. 30-60%) as
determined by titration. Transmission electron microscopy suggests
that the cast films possess cylindrical sulfonated polystyrene
domains. The films swell in water, with the extent of swelling
being dependent on the sulfonation level. Ionic conductivities
as high as 8.5 x 10^(-2) S/cm are obtained when fully hydrated,
and compare favorably to those exhibited by hydrated, sulfonated
fluoropolymers such as Nafion.</FONT>
<HR width=3>

<P>
<H3>INTRODUCTION</H3>
<P>
<FONT FACE="ARIAL">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Polymers with high protonic conductivities are potentially useful
as proton exchange membranes (PEM's) in fuel cells. Among the
earliest PEM's were sulfonated, crosslinked polystyrenes, and
these were employed in fuel cells on the Gemini space missions. <A href="#A1">[1]</A>
More recently, interest has been directed to sulfonated fluorocarbon
polymers, of which Nafion has been most extensively studied. <A href="#A2">[2-7]</A> 
This material has a high protonic conductivity (ca. 7 x 10-2 S/cm
at 30 oC) <A href="#A3">[8]</A> when hydrated and is chemically
rather inert.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="ARIAL">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been proposed that Nafion possesses an inverted micellar
structure, with spherical (ca. 40-50 &Aring; diameter) clusters
lined with sulfonic acid groups which are interconnected via ca.
10 &Aring; channels. <A href="#A4">[9-11]</A> We sought to mimic
this picture using inexpensive sulfonated, hydrocarbon-based block
copolymers. Block copolymers in general can exhibit a rich array
of microphase-separated morphologies depending on relative block
sizes. <A href="#A5">[12]</A> Such materials provide us with an
opportunity to link good ionic (protonic) conductivity through
water-swellable micro-domains with low material cost and desirable
mechanical properties. We note that selected block copolymers
have been shown to be useful as alkali metal-based polymer electrolytes, <A href="#A6">[13]</A> 
although apparently no efforts have been directed toward obtaining
high protonic conductivity based on hydrocarbon block polymers.</FONT>

<P>
<FONT FACE="ARIAL">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We selected Kraton G1652 for our studies as it contains a saturated
carbon center block which should be inert to the sulfonation reaction,
which in this case employs SO3/triethyl phosphate to achieve high
levels of sulfonation without crosslinking. <A href="#A7">[14]</A> 
The reaction is summarized in <A HREF="images/fig1acs.jpg" >Figure 1</A> . 
The Kraton used in this study contains 29% by weight styrene and
exhibits a microstructure of polystyrene phases intermediate between
spheres and cylinders (ca. 150 &Aring; in diameter) in an ethylene/
butylene-rich continuous phase. 16 Sulfonation levels, based on
the moles of styrene units sulfonated, ranged from 35-65% as determined
by titration. We note that sulfonated, saturated Kratons have
been disclosed in a patent, <A href="#A8">[15]</A> and that Weiss
and coworkers <A href="#A9">[16-18]</A> have explored in detail
the morphology and mechanical properties of lightly sulfonated
(up to 12 mol% styrene units) Kraton G1652, the latter representing
an interesting new class of ionomers. However, we are unaware
of studies directed at highly sulfonated derivatives with the
aim of obtaining highly proton conducting films.</FONT>
<P>
<H3>EXPERIMENTAL</H3>
<P>
<FONT FACE="ARIAL">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kraton G1652 was acquired from Shell Chemical; dichloroethane
(DCE) and cyclohexane were from Krackeler Scientific; triethyl
phosphate (TEP) and sulfur trioxide (SO3) were from Aldrich. All
materials were used without further purification. Sulfonation
of the styrene-ethylene/butylene-styrene (SEBS) triblock polymer
was carried out in a batch mode using SO3/TEP. <A href="#A7">[14]</A> 
The reaction vessel was kept slightly below 0oC and reaction times
ranged from 60-90 min. After removing most of the cyclohexane
and DCE, the residue was taken up into lower alcohols. Films were
then cast from these solutions on glass under an IR lamp.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="ARIAL">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Titrations to determine the sulfonic acid content of the film
were carried out using standardized sodium hydroxide solutions.
Films were hydrated in deionized water and washed by placing the
film in clean deionized water three times for one hour each. About
0.15 g of film was placed in a small vial and approximately 12
ml of sodium chloride solution was added. After immersion for
about 2 h, titrations to a phenolphthalein endpoint were carried
out. Data are reported as mol% styrene units sulfonated. Samples
for transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were first stained
for 15 min in the presence of RuO4 vapor and then cryomicrotomed
at -100 degrees celsius using a Reichert-Jung Fc4 microtome. A
2000 FX high resolution transmission electron microscope was employed
at a magnification of 275,000x.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="ARIAL">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conductivity measurements were made on samples treated to remove
any residual sulfuric acid from the sulfonation reaction. Samples
were soaked in water for 30 min. and then dried under an IR lamp
for 30 min, and this sequence was repeated twice. The conductivity
of the membrane was measured by using a pair of pressure-attached
high surface area platinum electrodes as described by Zawodsinski
et al.8 The mounted sample was immersed in distilled, deionized
water at room temperature (ca. 24 degrees Celsius). Once the sample
had completely hydrated, measurements were made from 1 Hz to 10KHz
using a Solartron 1260 frequency response analyzer. Both real
and imaginary components of the impedance were measured and the
real Z-axis intercept was closely approximated. The cell constant
was calculated from the spacing of the electrodes (L), the thickness
of the membrane and the area of the platinum electrodes (A). The
conductivity (s) was calculated using the equation</FONT>

<H3>RESULTS &amp DISCUSSION</H3>
<P>
<FONT FACE="ARIAL">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Films of sulfonated triblock polymer are yellow and relatively
transparent as well as elastomeric. A transmission electron micrograph
of a microtomed and RuO4-stained film (ca. 45% sulfonation) is
shown in Figure 2 and reveals what appear to be cylindrical (ca.
150 &Aring; in diameter) sulfonated polystyrene domains in an
ethylene/butylene matrix. We believe that at this high sulfonation
level, relatively homogeneous sulfonated polystyrene domains are
present rather than ionic clusters of sulfonated styrene repeat
units within polystyrene domains as is the case in lightly sulfonated
Kratons. <A href="#A9">[16-18]</A></FONT> 
<P>
<FONT FACE="ARIAL">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The films swell upon immersion in water, and the extent of swelling
is as expected dependent upon the sulfonation level. These hydrogels
retain their elastomeric character. We have no information on
the organization or the sizes of the sulfonated domains upon hydration,
but speculate that these are interconnected upon swelling and
perhaps forming bicontinuous phases. X-ray and neutron scattering
experiments are planned to address this important issue. The films
remain relatively transparent upon hydration, suggesting that
the water-swollen domains remain below ca. 400 nm in diameter.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="ARIAL">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ionic conductivities of fully hydrated films having various levels
of sulfonation are reported in <a href="table1.htm"> Table 1 </a>. Samples having sulfonation
levels greater than about 45% have conductivities comparable to
Nafion (ca. 7 x 10-2 S/cm) under similar conditions.(8) The amount
of sulfonation within the polystyrene domains is well above the
percolation threshold for ionic conduction of ca. 7 mol%, as recently
determined by Yeager, Eisenberg and coworkers <A href="#A10">[19]</A>  
for sulfonated homopolystyrene. The high conductivity we observe
indicates that the sulfonated domains are interconnected. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="ARIAL">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, we have prepared highly proton conducting, elastomeric
films by sulfonation of a styrene-ethylene/butylene-styrene triblock
polymer. Several applications of these materials are being investigated,
including their use as proton exchange membranes in fuel cells.</FONT>

<H3>INTRODUCTION</H3>
<P>
<FONT FACE="ARIAL">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The importance of deliberate modification of electrode surfaces has been well established [1]. The use of ionomers in electrode modification, introduced by Anson and Oyama [2], provides an elegantly simple approach. With ionomer coated
electrodes, one can immobilize a wide range of ionic electroactive compounds. The 
ionomeric systems used include poly(vinyl pyridine) [2], quarternized poly(vinyl pyridine) [3], poly(vinyl sulfate) [3], and Nafion(R) [4]. Of these, Nafion(R) system has been used extensively.<P>
Much recent attention has been given to new materials for proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells, and this has led to the development of an inexpensive ionomer system using sulfonated Kraton G1650  (styrene/ ethylene butylene/ styrene block copolymer)[5].The rich array of microphase separated morphologies of block copolymers provides one with an opportunity to link good ionic conductivity through water swellable microdomains with low material cost and desirable mechanical properties. We have found that redox-active cations are easily exchanged into the sulfonated block copolymer films. This preprint describes some preliminary results obtained from studies using this material as a coating for applications involving chemically modified
electrodes.</FONT>
<P></P>
<H3>EXPERIMENTAL</H3>
<P>
<FONT FACE="ARIAL">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="products.htm"><B>Sulfonated Kraton 
G1650</B></A> in alcohol solution form was a gift from the DAIS corporation. Ferrocenyl methyl trimethyl ammonium iodide was obtained from Strem Chemicals. Methyl viologen dichloride was obtained from Aldrich. The cyclic voltammetric studies were carried out with the aid of an EG&G PARC Model 173 potentiostat/galvanostat coupled with the EG&G PARC 175 Universal Programmer  and 
EG&G PARC 179 coulometer. The initial experiments were carried out on platinum electrodes (Bioanalytical Systems). There was some problem with adhesion of the polymer film to the electrode upon swelling in water. Hence thereafter modification of glassy carbon electrodes (GCE from Bioanalytical Systems) was carried out.<P>
The general procedure used in the voltammetric experiments was as follows. The electrode was polished with alumina powder and rinsed with distilled water. The electrode was then cleaned ultrasonically. The polymer, in the sulfonic acid form, was cast on the electrode from a 5wt% alcohol solution.  The polymer film was neutralized with sodium hydroxide, and then electroactive cations were exchanged into the ionomeric coating on the electrode.  Loading of the cations was followed amperometrically.</FONT>
<P></P>
<H3>RESULTS &amp DISCUSSION</H3>
<P>
<FONT FACE="ARIAL">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two kinds of electroactive species were used to investigate the behavior of the ionomer-modified electrodes, ferrocenylmethyl trimethyl ammonium ion and methyl viologen. <a name=fig1><A HREF="p1fig1.htm"> Figure 1</A> shows the loading curve for the ferrocenylmethyl trim ethyl ammonium ion, wherein the magnitude of the peak current correlates to the amount present in the polymer film. It can be inferred that saturation occurs in
about 4 hours.<P>
<a name=fig2><A HREF="p1fig2.htm"> Figure 2</A> is the cyclic voltammogram obtained when ferrocenylmethyl trimethyl ammonium ion is immobilized in the ionomer. The peak separation observed is 63 mV, which is very close to the expected value of 59 mV for a reversible system. <a  name=fig3><A HREF="p1fig3.htm"> Figure 3</A> shows the dependence of peak current on the scan rate with which the potential is ramped. The linearity of the plot implies that the charge transport inside the ionomeric film is diffusion controlled.<P> 
<a name=fig4><A HREF="p1fig4.htm"> Figures 4</A> shows the voltammetric behavior of a methyl viologen-loaded film, one at a lower scan rate (20 mV/s) and the other at a higher scan rate (200 mV/s). As can be seen from these figures, the width of the first oxidation peak depends on the scan rate. <a name=fig5><A HREF="p1fig5.htm"> Figure 5</A> shows the time dependence of broadening at a scan rate of 200 mV/s. We propose that the time and scan rate dependent broadening of the first oxidation peak may be the result of the much greater hydrophobicity of the two-electron reduction product, which may diffuse into the hydrophobic domains of the block polymer provided that sufficient time is given. The neutral species thus transported might have a different formal potential than one residing in
the sulfonated, hydrophilic domain. It is worth noting that not all neutral species will diffuse at the same rate. Thus, the electrode would "see" a mixture of species with different formal potentials and hence the broadening of the peak. The time dependence of the reduction in broadening is under investigation.</FONT>
<P></P>
<H3>CONCLUSIONS</H3><P> 
<FONT FACE="ARIAL">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feasibility of the use of sulfonated poly hydrocarbon ionomer has been
demonstrated. The electrochemical kinetics of the redox-active species within
the ionomer depends strongly on the type of the electroactive species. The redox 
behavior of methyl viologen may shed light on the internal domains of our ionomeric
system. Further experiments, which are in progress in our lab, will offer 
details about the charge and mass transport within the ionomer.</FONT>

<h3>ABSTRACT</h3>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In this paper, I report the ion transport properties of an elastomeric hydrogel made of a styrene-ethylene/butylene-styrene triblock polymer.  The goal is to find a sulfonation that will provide the polymer gel with a maximum conductivity for applications as an ion-conductive membrane and an electromechanically responsive material for an artificial muscle.  The first step to this goal was to test the conductivity of the polymer in the H+, Na+, and ferrocenated forms, each in 0.1, 1 and 2M NaCl solutions.  These values were compared to the conductivity values of a Nafion-117 polymer gel in the acid (H+) and neutralized (Na+) forms in the three solutions, and the conductivity values of the solution alone.  The styrene-ethylene/butylene-styrene triblock polymer in the acid form was the most conductive of the three forms.  The 2M NaCl solution produced higher conductivities than the more dilute solutions.  The acid form of the polymer gel was the most conductive; the neutralized form was less than the acid form, but approximately equal to the conductivities of the solution alone without a polymer; and the ferrocenated polymer was the most resistive.<p>
<br>
<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In the past two years, <a href="gary.htm"><B>Dr. Gary Wnek</B></a> and his undergraduate research team have been investigating this elastomeric, heavily sulfonated triblock polymer.  They discovered that when a DC electric field was applied, the gel bent toward the negative electrode.  The gel swelled more as the degree of sulfonation increased.  They also found that the maximum bending angle of the gel ocurred at 0.02M Na2SO4 solution concentration. (1)<p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It has been discovered in research on polymethacrylic acid membranes, that a change of ionization state of the membrane can alter insulin flux (2) and reverse hydration in the membrane and permeability to solutes (3).  An application of a DC electric field of 6V/cm was tested on polymethacrylic acid gels containing philocarpin.  The field induced the release of the drug into the surrounding bath (4).  Ionization state, cross-link density, and gel swelling are critical to determining whether the polymer gel Dr. Wnek's research group is investigating could have selectively augmented macromolecular transport properties by electrodiffusion, electroosmosis, and electrophoresis.<p>

	<br>
<h3>EXPERIMENTAL</h3>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The sulfonated polymer was obtained as a gift from the DAIS Corp. and is now available from the Aldrich Chemical Co. (cat. # 44888-5).  <p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Several impedance tests using AC voltage were run on the polymer gel.  The gel was mounted, first, by a lateral conductivity method, which attaches the platinum electrodes directly to the gel (5).  The conductivity and resistivity were calculated for each run.  The tests started with a 41% sulfonated gel batch.  The impedance test was run with the gel immersed in distilled water.  The gel was then placed in an excess NaOH solution for twenty-three hours to neutralize the gel.  This neutralized membrane was tested with the lateral conductivity method, just as before.  The gel was then placed in an excess solution of ferrocene for eighteen hours and was then was before.  The same tests were run again for a batch of gels having a sulfonation level of 57%.<p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A new test cell was formed, which was named the 
<a href = "images/doublel.gif"><B>"Double-L" cell</B></a>.  It was named this, because it looks like two letter "L"s facing each other with an O-ring in between them.  This cell was constructed to test the conductivity and resistivity of the gel, which was between the two "L"s, and which was filled with different concentrations of solutions.  The platinum electrodes each were placed through the top of each the "L"s to sit at ninety degree angles two the cell.  The electrodes in this method are not directly connected to the gel.<p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The conductivity was tested for 0.1M KCl solution without the membrane at 21.5 degrees C.  From this, an average cell constant was determined, in order to calculate the conductivity of the gel in the new cell.  The measured cell constant was 2.952/cm.  The cell constant does not have a dependence to polymer type, solution, or concentration of a solution.<p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tests were run on the polymer in the acid form in distilled water for the "Double-L" cell method.  Then the polymer was tested three times while in the acid form, twice in the neutralized form, and once in the ferrocenated form.  The acid and neutralized forms of a Nafion-117 polymer were tested once.  The polymer gel and the Nafion-117 gel in their specific forms were immersed and tested for each of these three solutions in the "Double-L" cell: 0.1M, 1M, and 2M solutions of NaCl.  The conductivity and resistance were measured for these solutions without a polymer gel in between the "L"s, in order to determine what effect the polymer had on the conductivity and resistance.<p>

<br>
<h3>DISCUSSION OF RESULTS</h3>     
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The 41% and 57% sulfonated styrene-ethylene/butylene-styrene triblock polymer tests, did not produce a trend in the conductivity.  The 57% sulfonated polymer had higher values for conductivity for the neutralized and ferrocenated forms, than the 41% sulfonated polymer.  However, the 41% sulfonated polymer had a higher conductivity that the 57% sulfonated polymer.  There are no reproductions of these tests, so the values may not be accurate.<p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The acid form was the most conductive of the three forms.  
<a href="images/condchg.gif"><B>Figure 1</B></a> shows the change in the values of the conductivity measured with the polymer gel from the values measured without the polymer.  From 
<a href="images/01molar.gif"><B>Figure 2</B></a>, 
<a href="images/1molar.gif"><B>Figure 3</B></a>, and 
<a href="images/2molar.gif"><B>Figure 4</B></a>, one can see that the acid form of the polymer was the most conductive; the neutralized form's conductivities were less than the acid form, but approximately equal to the conductivities of the solution alone; and the ferrocenated polymer was the most resistive.  The 2M NaCl solution produced higher conductivities than the more dilute solutions.<p> 
<br>
<h3>CONCLUSIONS</h3> 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; One cannot assume that the sulfonation level does not have an effect on the conductivity of the polymer.  There have not been enough tests performed on the different sulfonation levels.<p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; First, it was to be determined what ion exchange in the polymer produced the highest conductivity results.  The acid form, from the tests run on the polymer and the Nafion-117 gel, produced the highest conductivity values.  The results show that the polymer consistently produced higher conductivity values than the Nafion-117 gel.  It is concluded from the observation that the polymer gel shrunk when ferrocenated, one can conclude that the substitution of the ferrocene ion to the polymer renders the polymer more hydrophobic.  The hydrophobicity of this form of the polymer gel caused the polymer to reject the water, with which the polymer was hydrated.<p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The accuracy of the "Double-L" cell tests, may not be desirable.  The concentrations of the solutions were not always exactly the same when mixed, because when the NaCl was measured out, the weight was not precise (range = 0.06%).  The acid form conductivity values were and average of the three tests.  However, the neutralized form was only the values of one trial.  The ferrocenated form was only the one set of values that was tested.<p>
<br>
<h3>RECOMMENDATIONS</h3>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In order to determine the sulfonation level that will provide the polymer with a maximum conductivity, more tests must be conducted to determine the accuracy of the measured conductivity values.  Also, the effect of neytralizing cations on conductivity needs to be studied in more detail.<p>

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>Electricity created almost magically from hydrogen and 
air may soon power cars, portable electronic devices, lawn 
mowers, and snow throwers.
<p>The quiet, inexpensive, renewable power will come from 
fuel cells that use revolutionary, low-cost materials invented 
and patented by DAIS Corp., a Rensselaer incubator 
company. 
<p>This scientific advance was recognized Feb. 15, when 
DAIS received the 1995 Inventor of the Year Award from the 
Eastern New York Intellectual Property Law Association. 
The association represents patent attorneys, agents, and 
support personnel working in the field of intellectual 
property law throughout the Capital Region, said association 
president Wayne Reinke.
<p>Created in 1982, the Inventor of the Year Award 
recognizes a person or group of people whose invention the 
association finds noteworthy. "It is also an expression of 
appreciation to the community of inventors whose creative 
efforts have advanced the cause of civilization in this 
country and throughout the world," Reinke said.
<p>"The introduction of an affordable fuel cell will create a 
new market for this technology, putting it to work in a 
multitude of everyday uses, such as outdoor power tools," 
said Scott Ehrenberg, president of DAIS.
<p>Fuel-cell technology has been available since the 1960s 
and was pioneered by the Apollo and Gemini space 
missions, according to Gary Wnek, professor and chair of 
chemistry. The high cost of materials has been a major 
drawback in creating these environmentally friendly power 
sources, said Wnek, who helped develop the unique new 
fuel-cell materials.
<p>The DAIS Hy-Air fuel cell uses a new, low-cost proton-
exchange membrane (PEM) known as DAIS 585. With a 
price less than half that of its nearest competitor, this 
technological breakthrough was developed with a grant 
from DAIS in cooperation with Rensselaer's New York State 
Center for Polymer Synthesis. <cite><B><FONT SIZE=3 FACE="ARIAL">(<a href="work.htm">How fuel cells
work</a>).</FONT></B></cite>

<b><p>In addition, the DAIS "Hy-Air" fuel cell uses economical 
new materials for its electrode and stack structure. This 
makes the fuel cell truly affordable to the general public.
<p>The cost of the DAIS cell and its operation will be similar 
to that of traditional power sources such as small internal 
combustion engines. But the fuel cell will burn no petroleum, 
create no emissions, be absolutely noise-free, will not harm 
the environment, and will be smaller and more compact than 
traditional engines and motors, said Timothy Tangredi, 
executive vice president of DAIS.
<p>Apart from the "Hy-Air" technology, there are no other 
low-cost fuel cells on the market, Tangredi said.
<p>DAIS plans to introduce a complete line of "Hy-Air" fuel 
cells this year.</B><P></P></TT></font></BLOCKQUOTE>

<I><FONT SIZE=3><B>The following article appeared in the Elsevier Advanced Technology &quot;Membrane Technology&quot; newsletter in January of 1996 :</B></FONT></FONT></I><BR>
<CENTER><hr><h2><FONT COLOR=#008000 FACE=ARIAL>New Generation of Low
Cost Polymer</FONT></h2></center>
<HR>
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="ARIAL">A polymer breakthrough has brought the <FONT COLOR="#9f0000" FACE="ARIAL"><B><b><I>DAIS</I></b> Corporation</FONT></B> one step
closer to realizing its vision of producing an affordable fuel
cell for everyday use. The high level of ionic conductivity and
the low relative production cost of the Dais 585, as the new polymer
is known, will also enable its use in a wide range of membrane
applications such as gas separation and biomedical coatings.<BR>
<BR>
Fuel cell proton electrode membranes (PEM's) require polymers
with high protonic conductivity's. The earliest fuel cells, including
those developed by General Electric for the Gemini and Apollo
space missions, used sulfonated, cross-linked polystyrene polymers.
More recently, the membrane materials of choice have been those
based on sulfonated fluorocarbon  materials, such as DuPont's
Nafion. The new material, a sulfonated styrene/ethylene-butylene
styrene triblock copolymer, displays an ionic conductive of .09
S/cm<SUP><B>2</B></SUP>, 10 -15% higher than competitive materials, at
almost 40% lower cost.<BR>
<BR>
The material was developed at the <I><B>Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute</B></I>,
Troy, New York, USA with a grant from the DAIS, whose mission
is to develop polymeric materials and to use them in low cost
electrical power sources.<BR>
<BR>
To achieve this, researchers are currently working to improve
the power density  and lifetime of the material. Independent research by 
BCS Technologies in Bryan, Texas, USA has shown power density
results of 6 watts for a membrane active area of 25cm<SUP><B>2</B></SUP>,
at 50<SUP><B>0</B></SUP>C (in air). Lifetime testing of the novel polymer
has now exceeded 3,000 hours. These results mean that the DAIS
Corporation will launch a 125w fuel cell, using the DAIS 585 membrane
polymer, in the June 1996 timeframe. The Company is offering the
new materials in polymer form at sulfonation levels of 45% - 55%
as a precast film or as a casting solution.<BR>

<H3><FONT FACE="ARIAL">Executive Summary</FONT></H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="ARIAL">There are many power producing products available on the market  today. Batteries and internal combustion engines are foremost among  these products. Both batteries and internal combustion engines have an established infra-structure, are priced to fit diverse applications, and are readily available. The disadvantages  of these traditional products revolve around  practical limitations and environmental issues. Fuel cell technology has the ability to magnify  the positive aspects of these existing products while overcoming the practical and environmental challenges.</FONT><P></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="ARIAL">Historically, fuel cell development has been directed toward high  reliability/high cost systems, such as the NASA  space missions of the 1960s. Maximized performance is paramount for such uses.  Consequently, the materials, control systems, and designs have reflected this bias and are in many cases over-designed for cost-sensitive commercial applications. There is an urgent need in the public sector for economic fuel cells to serve as alternatives to internal combustion engines or to provide sources  of longer portable power. By necessity, the design objectives  of fuel cell development have  changed from high performance/high cost to a more down-to-earth focus on high reliability/low cost in order to become cost competitive for specific applications.</FONT><P></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="ARIAL">Beginning with the principle  of cost by application,' the DAIS Corporation has developed a series of new proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell materials. These materials include (1) a new membrane, (2) a cost effective electrode structure engineered for use with the membrane, (3) an interface polymer to mate the membrane and electrode, and (4) two novel "stack" or housing designs that make best use of the novel materials.</FONT> <P></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="ARIAL">The primary target market for these  PEM fuel cell innovations is in the portable power source arena. Applications abound, including outdoor recreational products, domestic emergency power devices, portable power supplies for military personnel, trades-person tool and site power, and portable equipment power supplies.  A  second market for the PEM fuel cell technology is manufacturers of products that use small engines (i.e. all sorts of outdoor power equipment, portable generators, small transportation uses, marine applications, and solar hydrogen hybrids).</FONT><P></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="ARIAL">DAISs fuel cell technology possesses several advantages over existing battery technologies in terms of weight, energy density, unit lifetime, and cost.</FONT><P></P>

<FONT FACE="ARIAL">Given this unique forums mission statement of "The Dawn of Commercialization," it is DAISs intention to present a brief summary  of these technical advances,  and indicate how these novel materials assembled in a fuel cell will impact the marketplace acceptance of fuel cell technology.</FONT><P></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><FONT FACE="ARIAL">I. Forms of Power</FONT></H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="ARIAL">There are many power producing products available on the market  today. Batteries and internal combustion engines comprise the majority  of these products.</FONT><P></P> 

<FONT FACE="ARIAL">Many products that use batteries are standardized  to accept the traditional AA, AAA, C, D, or automobile sized batteries. In 1995 there were over 5.3 billion dry cell batteries (of all types) alone sold worldwide<SUP>2</SUP>.  There are over 62,000 gasoline retailers in the US<SUP>3</SUP>. This is a large established infrastructure for obtaining the required fuel for internal combustion engine applications.</FONT><P></P>  

<FONT FACE="ARIAL">A grocery store in Minot, North Dakota can sell "AA" sized batteries for approximately the same cost as a similar store in Florence, Italy. This speaks to the accepted form factor of "AA" batteries, and of the relative price acceptance of the batterys functionality. An Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) in Troy, NY uses a 5hp, 4 cycle engine that costs approximately $155 per unit to power its line of outdoor power equipment. This is the same unit that a firm in Moline, Illinois would use to power its line of outdoor equipment. People have accepted the design, the availability, the costs , the upkeep, the risks, and the compromises and undesirable aspects of the two primary forms of power.</FONT><P></P>

<FONT FACE="ARIAL">The point is that  major forms of power in the world today are an outgrowth of over 100 years of product and technology evolution. This evolution has accepted the compromises of the given technology.</FONT> <P></P>

<FONT FACE="ARIAL">And certainly these  products are not without deficiency and compromise. The very definition of compromise is the lack of features or functionality that the entire marketplace has had to accept.</FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="ARIAL">In todays battery powered technology these compromises are:</FONT>
   <UL>
   <LI><FONT FACE="ARIAL">weight</FONT>
   <LI><FONT FACE="ARIAL">environmental disposal</FONT>
   <LI><FONT FACE="ARIAL">lifetime</FONT>
</UL>

<FONT FACE="ARIAL">A minimal set of compromises for the internal combustion engine include:</FONT>
   <UL>
   <LI><FONT FACE="ARIAL">noise</FONT>
   <LI><FONT FACE="ARIAL">weight</FONT>
   <LI><FONT FACE="ARIAL">environmental damage</FONT>
   <LI><FONT FACE="ARIAL">efficiency of operation</FONT>
</UL></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="ARIAL">Any new power generation approach  has to address not only the perceived negatives but include the strengths of the existing technology. Given the 100 plus year infrastructure build up for battery and internal combustion technology,  the first issue a new technology would need to address is cost competitiveness.</FONT><P></P>

<FONT FACE="ARIAL">Consumer studies have repeatedly shown that new technology generally can charge an incremental premium given an easily perceived increase in value or functionality <SUP>4</SUP>.</FONT><P></P>

<FONT FACE="ARIAL">With this in mind,  and recognizing the compromise issues outlined above,  the conclusion can be drawn that a new form of power producing technology needs to include the following attributes:</FONT><P></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="ARIAL">Fuel cell technology has the ability to meet  these  new technology attributes. Fuel cells possess the necessary characteristics to excel as power source in the next wave of technology.</FONT><P></P></BLOCKQUOTE>


<H3><FONT FACE="ARIAL">II. History that leads to the Future</FONT></H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="ARIAL">Fuel cell development, since the NASA missions of the 1960s, has focused on high reliability, high cost systems. Consequently, the materials, control systems, and designs have reflected this bias and are in many cases over-designed for cost-sensitive commercial applications. DAIS has adopted the strategy  that in order to compete against traditional forms of power generation fuel cell technology must have high reliability and be priced to address the application.</FONT><P></P>

<FONT FACE="ARIAL">Historically fuel cell technology has been priced at approximately $8 per Watt. What is behind this sky-high expense?  Quite simply, the  cost of the materials forced a need to obtain the highest power output possible. Engineers and scientists added gas hydration, compression, and heat. These ancillary devices, coupled with the basic cost of the materials have produced a situation that violates Required Attribute #1 stated above: staying within 7% of existing power production methods.</FONT><P></P>

<FONT FACE="ARIAL">In 1993, the DAIS Corporation formed to address the materials aspect of this technology. The emphasis was placed on developing a set of materials that could eliminate  the compromises of the existing forms of power generation while tailoring the materials to commercial application(s). As an example:</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

   <UL>
   <LI><FONT FACE="ARIAL">the average lifetime of a lawnmower powered by a 5hp internal combustion engine in the US is 455 hours.<SUP>6</SUP></FONT> 
   <LI><FONT FACE="ARIAL">the average lifetime of a 125cc Scooter in Europe is 1890 hours.<SUP>7</SUP></FONT> 
   <LI><FONT FACE="ARIAL">the average lifetime of a 6v lantern battery running a Coleman 7300 series camping lantern is 8.5 hours.<SUP>8</SUP></FONT> 
</UL>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="ARIAL">By comparison the DAIS materials all have a rated life that exceeds each application lifetime stated above. Traditional fuel cells have longer lifetimes, and (using the ancillary equipment) higher power densities per cell. This existing technology again violates the first principle of marketplace acceptance - the costs are too high to create an upsurge  of support.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>


<H3><FONT FACE="ARIAL">III. The DAIS Materials</FONT></H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="ARIAL">The DAIS materials have been engineered  to run in the following operational environment:</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

   <UL>
   <LI><FONT FACE="ARIAL">Ambient pressure on the Cathode </FONT>
   <LI><FONT FACE="ARIAL">Operating temperatures of 35 to 50<SUP>0</SUP> C</FONT>
   <LI><FONT FACE="ARIAL">No additional hydration of the reactant gases</FONT> 
   <LI><FONT FACE="ARIAL">Active controlled air flow over the Cathode</FONT> 
   <LI><FONT FACE="ARIAL">Consistent power level of no less than 200 mW/cm<SUP>2</SUP></FONT> 
   <LI><FONT FACE="ARIAL">Power density of .17 to .23 kW/liter and .45 to .61 kW/kg</FONT> 
   <LI><FONT FACE="ARIAL">Lifetime minimum of 2,500 hours per cell</FONT>
</UL>

<H4><FONT FACE="ARIAL">A. The DAIS 585 Membrane:</FONT></H4>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="ARIAL">The DAIS membrane material (known as <EM>DAIS 585</EM>) is a sulfonated styrene/ethylene-butylene/styrene triblock copolymer. The material is an elastic, hydrocarbon-based hydrogel with cation exchange ability, and good optical transparency. The block copolymer contains approximately 29% wt styrene units. Sulfonation levels (based on styrene units) range from ca.15-60%. Water uptake and extent of swelling depend on the sulfonation level.</FONT><P></P>

<FONT FACE="ARIAL">Cast films in the acid (H+) forms have ionic conductivity's (when fully hydrated) of greater than 9 x 10-2 S/cm, which are comparable to those of the fluoropolymer Nafion®. Numerous derivatives with different cations, including many that are redox-active, are readily prepared from the parent polymer</FONT>.<P></P>

<FONT FACE="ARIAL">The material is available at sulfonation levels of 55%-60% as a pre-cast reinforced film (approximate thicknesses of 50 - 200 micron) or as a solution in alcohol (either 5% or 10% solids).</FONT><P></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<H4><FONT FACE="ARIAL">B. The DAIS electrode and Membrane/Electrode Assembly:</FONT></H4>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="ARIAL">The DAIS electrode is a porous gas diffusion electrode comprised  of (a) an electronically conductive porous body in electrical contact with (b) a catalyst layer that in turn consists of  (i) a catalyst dispersed on the surface of a carbon support; (ii) a water-insoluble sulfonated polystyrene, sulfonated poly(a-methylstyrene) or sulfonated styrene-ethylene-butylene-styrene (SEBS) block copolymer; and (iii) a nonionic fluorocarbon polymer.</FONT><P></P>

<FONT FACE="ARIAL">The preferred sulfonated polystyrenes, poly(a-methylstyrene)s and SEBS's have a conductivity of 0.04 S/cm or greater, a molecular weight from 30,000 to 1,000,000, and are 10 to 60 mole percent sulfonated. The sulfonated polystyrene is percentage of the molecular weight (200,000 to 400,000). The catalyst material is platinum.</FONT><P></P> 

<FONT FACE="ARIAL">The DAIS electrodes (and interface polymer), when mated with the DAIS 585 membrane, form a Membrane Electrode Assembly (MEA).</FONT> <P></P>

<FONT FACE="ARIAL">DAIS MEAs come in a variety of shapes with a 6" square presently being the largest. Power densities of the all-DAIS membrane electrode assembly have yielded 165mW/cm2 at 5/10 of a volt. <A HREF="http://dais.net/images/curve.jpg" TITLE="Please click">Please click</A> here to view a recent power curve using passive and active air forced over the cathode.</FONT><P></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<H4><FONT FACE="ARIAL">C.  The DAIS "PowerCell" Stack Designs <SUP>9</SUP>:</FONT></H4>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="ARIAL">Traditional stack housing designs require peripheral support devices (compressors, heaters, water inlet/outlet, etc.) to yield high electrical current. The housings tended to be constructed of a block- style heavy gauge stainless steel metal with individual cell components made of a graphite-like (or filled) composite material. </FONT><P></P>

<FONT FACE="ARIAL">By way of contrast -- the DAIS  fuel cell housing designs (Radial Air Stack  RAS, and Single In Line Module  SIM) provide special  air and hydrogen flows, and successfully manage the water produced by the fuel cells electrochemical reaction.  The base materials are made of engineering grade plastics. The Radial Air design is unique  due to its air flow pattern and use of a single compression bolt along with external hydrogen fuel distribution manifolds. The SIM design is progressive in regards  to the ease of parts  fabrication, low cost, and active material protection. Each design is lightweight, and is specifically targeted to be used in portable or semi-portable consumer, commercial, or military applications.</FONT><P></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

 
<B><FONT FACE="ARIAL">Figure 1: <I>RAS Stack Design</FONT></I></B><BR><P></P>
<IMG SRC="http://dais.net/images/fc2000f2.gif" WIDTH=300 HEIGHT=800 HSPACE=25>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="ARIAL">Both novel housing designs (RAS and SIM) are engineered for use with the DAIS Corporations patented (or patent pending) Proton Exchange Membrane based fuel cell materials (membrane electrolyte, anode cathode, backing material, and interface polymer). Furthermore , it is possible to combine the best aspects of each design into a single design that is far superior to either design alone.</FONT> <P></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

 
<B><FONT FACE="ARIAL">Figure 2: <I>Single In Line Module Design - Passive</FONT></I></B><BR><P></P>
<IMG SRC="http://dais.net/images/fc2000f1.gif" WIDTH=400 HEIGHT=400>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="ARIAL">Both designs can be either passive or active air flow managed. The use of the passive mode makes a less expensive PowerCell device. Adding the active air flow over the cathode generally produces a 3x improvement in the overall power density. Each air management scheme can be adapted  to a specific  application or price point.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="ARIAL">DAIS requires  its materials and designs to not only function and provide stable power but to be financially attractive to end users. This is a fundamental axiom with DAIS, whether the end user is an electrician working with portable power tools on a remote job site or a large multi-national firm that produces outdoor power equipment. The cost and functionality must meet Attribute #1 of cost competitiveness as stated before.</FONT><P></P>

<FONT FACE="ARIAL">The above chart is an estimate of how the DAIS technologies will price at a retail level given a modest level of production volume.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><FONT FACE="ARIAL">V. Conclusions and Summary</FONT></H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="ARIAL">The benefits of fuel cell technology have long been out of reach for commercial, military, or consumer use. The primary reasons have been the  cost of the materials, and the resulting physical designs required to make the technology work have proved unable to make the grade for popular marketplace acceptance.</FONT><P></P><BR>

<FONT FACE="ARIAL">The DAIS Corporation has examined the cost-to-application needs of this exciting technology of Proton Exchange Membrane fuel cells. Each element of this technology has been analyzed from the perspective of cost, manufacturing, and application. DAIS has invented new, lower cost, functional materials including a new hydrocarbon based membrane, a stable electrode assembly, a novel interface polymer, and two advanced  stack designs.</FONT><P></P>

<FONT FACE="ARIAL">These new materials and stack/housing designs form the basis for an applications priced method of electrical power generation. This technology will initially be aimed at the appliance marketplace of 1kW and under.<P></P></FONT>

<b>Greetings,
Since I read about Mercedes Benz using fuel cells in an 
experimental car, I have been looking for a company doing 
research in the USA. I think fuel cells may be the next 
generation's power and the US automotive industry will need 
a jump start when they finnaly realize that fact. I need to 
know more about fuel cells, before I would invest in them.
Hence, your work is very interesting.
Best Regards,
John C. Bisely</b><br>

<H3><I>Synthesis of Polymers with Unusual Electrical and Optical Properties</I></H3>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A major component of our research program has as its broad theme the synthesis and characterization of polymeric materials, with particular attention given to materials having interesting electrical and optical properties.  For example, we recently developed a new approach for the functionalization of silicones which may have utility as dielectrics, electrolytes or non-linear optical materials, and now we are evaluating these materials using a variety of electrical and optical characterization techniques.

<H3><I><FONT FACE="ARIAL">Electroactive Polymers in Biomedicine</FONT></I></H3>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Exciting technological opportunities are envisioned for polymers which are good conductors of electricity or, perhaps more importantly, are redox-active.  Of particular interest to us are applications of electroactive polymers in biology.  A number of properties change as the degree of oxidation or reduction of an electroactive polymer changes, such as electrical resistance, optical absorption, and ionic permeability.  These electrically-induced changes can be exploited in the development of biosensors, matrices for controlled release of both small and macromolecular substances, and substrates for cell growth.  

<H3><I><FONT FACE="ARIAL">Morphology Modulation Using Electric and Magnetic Fields</FONT></I></H3>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Electric fields have a profound effect on the morphology of polymer blend films and may be useful processing aids.  Anisotropic properties resulting from field-induced phase alignment are being measured.  The effect of electric fields on the morphology of block copolymers is currently being studied.

<H3><I><FONT FACE="ARIAL">Probes of Interfacial Adhesion in Composite Materials</FONT></I></H3>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ESR spin probes have been attached to silica surfaces in order to assess the quality of the interfacial bond in glass/polymer composites as a function of temperature, moisture, and mechanical cycling.  Experiments with high-performance composites are in progress.

<FONT FACE="ARIAL"><I><B>Spill/Leak Procedures:</B></I> Ventilate area of leak or spill. Remove all sources of ignition. Clean-up personnel require protective clothing
and respiratory protection from vapors. Small spills may be absorbed on paper towels and evaporated in a fume hood. Allow enough time for fumes to clear hood, then ignite paper
in a suitable location away from combustible materials. Contain and recover liquid for reclamation when possible. Larger spills and lot sizes can be collected as hazardous waste and atomized in a suitable RCRA approved combustion chamber, or absorbed with vermiculite, dry sand, earth or similar material for disposal as hazardous waste in a RCRA approved facility. Do not flush to sewer! Water can be used to dilute to raise flashpoint and to flush away from possible sources of ignition.<p>

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>A fuel cell is an electro-chemical device that generates 
electricity through a controlled reaction between inexpensive 
hydrogen and air, said Gary Wnek, professor and chair of 
chemistry.
<p>Fuel cells are functionally superior to batteries in that a 
fuel cell's lifetime is limited only by the supply of air and a 
tank of hydrogen. In contrast, batteries have a defined 
lifetime, are heavy, have disposal restrictions, and may 
require extended periods of recharging.
<p>In any spontaneous chemical reaction, electrons are 
redistributed and energy is released that can be put to work. 
When hydrogen and oxygen react spontaneously, in the 
presence of a suitable catalyst such as platinum, to form 
water, electrons flow from the hydrogen to the oxygen.
<p>To control the electron flow and make it useful as 
electrical energy, the gasses must be kept apart. Otherwise 
they would react explosively, Wnek said.
<p>In a fuel cell, the gasses are not in physical contact. They 
are separated by a membrane, which only permits positively 
charged hydrogen ions (protons) to cross over to the oxygen 
side and form water.
<p>Electron flow is localized at thin platinum electrodes on 
opposite sides of the membrane. Electrons from the 
hydrogen-side electrode flow across a wire to the opposite 
electrode. This flow provides the electricity to power electric 
motors or other devices.
<p>Most fuel cell units are designed to be stacked - looking 
like a stack of sandwiches. Adding more cells to a stack 
provides greater power.</B><P></P></TT></font></BLOCKQUOTE>

<p><font face="Arial">A total of 223 applications were received

width="15" height="15"> </b></font><font face="Arial"><b>Allocations:</b> </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Licence offers were made on 15 November
1996. The successful applicants had one week in which to confirm
acceptance of the licences offered, and a further week in which
to arrange payment of 10% of the licence fee as a deposit. The
following tables reflect the allocation of licences as accepted
rather than the original offers. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Applications for both species of squid
exceeded the number of licences available by a significant
amount. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong><i>Loligo</i></strong><i><br>
</i>34 applications were received for licences to fish for Loligo
squid. The majority of applications were for long-term licences.
14 licences were offered and accepted. This is a decrease from
the 17 vessels which have operated in recent first seasons. The
reduction in licences has been necessary as the effective fishing
effort of the vessels involved in the fishery has been gradually
increasing. All the vessels in the <i>Loligo</i> fishery have
long-term licences which expiry dates ranging between 1997 and
2001. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong><i>Illex</i></strong><i><br>
</i>Approximately 160 applications for <i>Illex</i> licences in
respect of jigging vessels were received. 90 of these
applications have been successful. Effort in the <i>Illex</i>
fishery has been held at 1993 levels. In view of early closures
of the <i>Illex</i> season in recent years and the results of
joint Argentine/British research cruises, it is felt that any
increase in effort on <i>Illex</i> would not be justified. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A small number (15) of <i>Illex</i>
licences have been offered in respect of jigging vessels on a
long-term (5 year) basis. This development complies with the
current fisheries policy. It is seeking to encourage local
Falkland involvement in the <i>Illex</i> fishery to move onto a
sounder footing. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">As in previous years, trawlers have taken
up a number of seasonal <i>Illex</i> licences. The newly
introduced combined <i>Illex</i> and restricted Finfish licence
for trawlers has attracted a high number of applicants.<br>

COMMITMENT TO FALKLANDS-MALVINAS IN XMAS MESSAGE</strong> </font></p>

face="Arial"><strong>PORT STANLEY.(MP).-</strong> In a special
Xmas message broadcast by the BBC directly from London to the
islands, British Prime Minister John Major said that Britain's
commitment to the Falklanders has not diminished in any way.
&quot;<em>Our developing relationship with Argentina will not be
at the expense of Britain's unchanging commitment to the Falkland
Islands</em>&quot;, said Major following a tradition started by
his predecessor Margaret Thatcher in 1982, six months after the
end of the South Atlantic conflict, when the first Xmas message
to the islands was broadcasted. Major said that Britain continues
to seek a stable and productive relationship with Argentina, not
just because of the interests both countries have in common,
&quot;<em>but because as you have repeatedly told us, it's in
your interest too, as the progress on oil exploration has vividly
shown us</em>&quot;. &quot;<em>You have the right to live under
the flag of your choice , and we shall continue to ensure that
you enjoy that right, and that you enjoy security</em>&quot;,
underlined the Prime Minister. The remarks come as rumours of a
massive reduction in the current British troop levels in the
Falklands-Malvinas are being circulated and just a few days
before the Defence Secretary, Michael Portillo begins a short
visit to the islands. Major also talked about the opportunities
and challenges that the prospects of commercially exploitable oil
reserves being discovered in the islands could bring. &quot;<em>Some
of you I know are nervous about the implications for your
environment and your traditional way of life and I understand
those fears. We've had to face in many ways similar challenges,
but I believe they can be surmounted</em>&quot;. Finally the
British Prime Minister also talked about a long term fisheries
agreement with Argentina. The fishing industry, particularly
squid licenses, remains the islands main income. &quot;<em>I know
how important fishing remains to your prosperity. It seems to me
that one of the priorities 1997 should be to make progress on an
agreement with Argentina to assure the fish stocks of the South
West Atlantic</em>&quot;. </font></p>

face="Arial"><strong>STANLEY.(MP).-</strong> As has been
tradition since she left power, the former British Prime Minister
and now Baroness Thatcher also sent her personal Xmas greetings
to the Falklanders, this time congratulating the islanders for
their British loyalty. With very emotive words, appealing to
memories of the past during the 1982 conflict, Baroness Thatcher
told the islanders how close to the Falklands-Malvinas her heart
and mind remain, and with particular admiration for the United
States, -&quot;<em>the only nation truly founded on freedom-</em>&quot;,
remembered &quot;<em>how very important Casper Weinberger (the
then US Secretary of Defence) with his assistance, had been at
that time</em>&quot;. Baroness Thatcher went on to say how glad
she felt when reading, in the FI Newsletter (the islands lobby
publication in London), the official policy of the islands:
&quot;<em>The Falklands-Malvinas are British and will continue to
be British. Any alteration is something which is to be entirely
self-determined by the people of the islands</em>&quot;. But the
former Prime Minister who recovered the islands in 1982, also
reminded the Falklanders that &quot;<em>we must never take for
granted the bravery and generosity of America not the heroism and
service of those to whose sacrifice and sense of duty we will be
eternally in deb</em>t&quot;. </font></p>

face="Arial"><strong>STANLEY. (MP).-</strong> For the fourth year
in succession Argentine Foreign Secretary Guido Di Tella has sent
a Xmas gift to the islanders: this year 600 copies of the short
allegory &quot;<em>The Little Prince&quot;</em>, written and
illustrated by French author Antoine de Saint-Expury. In the
accompanying letter addressed &quot;<em>my dear neighbour</em>&quot;,
Di Tella explains why he picked this particular book: &quot;<em>a
delightful little book that the author says it was written for
grown ups full of imagination and dreams, who were children not
so long ago</em>&quot; Last year Di Tella sent a photograph of
his many grandchildren, several of whom he maintained were &quot;<em>foreigners</em>&quot;
because of their European background. In Xmas 1994 the gift was a
video cassette of the popular BBC series &quot;<em>Pingu the
Penguin</em>&quot;, while previously he had sent a coloured
postcard of Buenos Aires. Reaction in the islands to Di Tella's
charm policy as usual, was of indifference or regretful that
Argentine tax payers money was not used for a better purpose.
&quot;<em>This is a pointless exercise by an eccentric man</em>&quot;,
said Councilor John Birmingham. </font></p>

JOINT COOPERATION AREA</strong></font><font face="Arial"> </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>STANLEY (MP).-</strong> British and
Argentine representatives are working at full speed to ensure
that seismic surveying in the joint co-operation area can get
started by next February and the oil exploration licensing round
at the end of 1997. The 18.000 square kilometres special joint
co-operation area in the South Atlantic, (where Argentine and
Falklands-Malvinas waters overlap), was created in the 1995 New
York oil agreement between Prime Minister Major and President
Menem. Phyllis Rendell Director of the Oil Department of the
Falklands-Malvinas just back from a meeting of the South Atlantic
Hydrocarbons Committee (SAHC), held in London, said that the
basic idea behind the co-operation is that levels and standards
for the oil industry are made extensive to the whole South
Atlantic. <em>&quot;We will encourage companies working on our
waters to participate in activities in the special co-operation
area</em>&quot;, underlined Mrs. Rendell. Mrs. Rendell said that
the SAHC is drafting proposals to ensure that both governments
equally share income generated in the special area and has also
received several proposals to outline the trenches. &quot;<em>Two
seismic companies are already interested in operating which we
expect could begin next February, and by the end of '97 the oil
licensing round should be launched</em>&quot;, remarked Mrs.
Rendell. But in spite of the overall optimism and the 1998
timetable agreed during the SAHC meeting, Mrs. Rendell warned
that there is an enormous work load ahead since the Argentine and
British licensing systems are so radically different. Experts of
the SAHC are scheduled to meet again next March in Buenos Aires.</font></p>

VISIT THE ISLANDS</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>STANLEY. (MP).-</strong> A small
team of journalists from Buenos Aires will be joining the two
Argentine groups of next of kin relatives when they travel to the
islands to visit the war cemetery in Darwin in mid January and
February. The announcement was made public by a member of the
local Legislative Council after &quot;<em>receiving a request</em>&quot;
from the Argentine government. The group of journalists will
include a news editor from the Buenos Aires Herald, a television
team from &quot;<em>Multimedia America</em>&quot; and a reporter
from TELAM, the official Argentine news agency. The first visit
of this kind to the war cemetery in Darwin where 234 Argentines
are buried took place in March 1991. On this occasion the
Argentines will be staying overnight at the Darwin lodge. </font></p>

TO FRICTIONS WITH BRITISH PRESS</strong></font><font face="Arial"> </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>STANLEY. (MP).-</strong> Oil has
yet to be found and in commercially sustainable volumes, but
controversy has already taken off. First it was Tony Lloyd,
Labour MP and shadow spokesman for the area who after a short
visit suggested that the islands would have to pass on to the
British Treasury some of the enormous revenue expected from the
coming oil bonanza. This was followed by reports from British
journalists, guests of the islands' government, who indicated the
possibility of a 1,1 billion pounds oil revenue in twenty years
time, and wondered what could this mean for the personality and
unique life style of the Falklanders. The Times went further and
in an editorial reminded the islanders that &quot;<em>citizens
have as many obligations as rights, the main of which is to pay
taxes according to their means</em>&quot;. Although a colony
islanders are full British citizens. The Falklands-Malvinas
government, in spite of the recent optimism about oil, has tried
to down play the controversy by arguing that it's not possible to
pretend a fixed rate, &quot;<em>when we still don't know how much
we will be receiving</em>&quot;. Councillors on the other hand
confirmed in a release that &quot;<em>it was on their own
initiative that they wrote a letter two years ago to the British
government offering to defray the cost of the defence of the
Falkland Islands should a sufficient quantity of oil be found</em>&quot;. </font></p>

COMMITMENT TO FALKLANDS-MALVINAS IN XMAS MESSAGE</strong> </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong><img src="images/london1.gif"

face="Arial"><strong>PORT STANLEY.(MP).- In a special Xmas
message broadcast by the BBC directly from London to the islands,
British Prime Minister John Major said that Britain's commitment
to the Falklanders has not diminished in any way</strong>. &quot;<em>Our
developing relationship with Argentina will not be at the expense
of Britain's unchanging commitment to the Falkland Islands</em>&quot;,
said Major following a tradition started by his predecessor
Margaret Thatcher in 1982, six months after the end of the South
Atlantic conflict, when the first Xmas message to the islands was
broadcasted. Major said that Britain continues to seek a stable
and productive relationship with Argentina, not just because of
the interests both countries have in common, &quot;<em>but
because as you have repeatedly told us, it's in your interest
too, as the progress on oil exploration has vividly shown us</em>&quot;.
&quot;<em>You have the right to live under the flag of your
choice , and we shall continue to ensure that you enjoy that
right, and that you enjoy security</em>&quot;, underlined the
Prime Minister. The remarks come as rumours of a massive
reduction in the current British troop levels in the
Falklands-Malvinas are being circulated and just a few days
before the Defence Secretary, Michael Portillo begins a short
visit to the islands. Major also talked about the opportunities
and challenges that the prospects of commercially exploitable oil
reserves being discovered in the islands could bring. &quot;<em>Some
of you I know are nervous about the implications for your
environment and your traditional way of life and I understand
those fears. We've had to face in many ways similar challenges,
but I believe they can be surmounted</em>&quot;. Finally the
British Prime Minister also talked about a long term fisheries
agreement with Argentina. The fishing industry, particularly
squid licenses, remains the islands main income. &quot;<em>I know
how important fishing remains to your prosperity. It seems to me
that one of the priorities 1997 should be to make progress on an
agreement with Argentina to assure the fish stocks of the South
West Atlantic</em>&quot;. </font></p>

face="Arial"><strong>STANLEY.(MP).-</strong> As has been
tradition since she left power, the former British Prime Minister
and now Baroness Thatcher also sent her personal Xmas greetings
to the Falklanders, this time congratulating the islanders for
their British loyalty. With very emotive words, appealing to
memories of the past during the 1982 conflict, Baroness Thatcher
told the islanders how close to the Falklands-Malvinas her heart
and mind remain, and with particular admiration for the United
States, -&quot;<em>the only nation truly founded on freedom-</em>&quot;,
remembered &quot;<em>how very important Casper Weinberger (the
then US Secretary of Defence) with his assistance, had been at
that time</em>&quot;. Baroness Thatcher went on to say how glad
she felt when reading, in the FI Newsletter (the islands lobby
publication in London), the official policy of the islands:
&quot;<em>The Falklands-Malvinas are British and will continue to
be British. Any alteration is something which is to be entirely
self-determined by the people of the islands</em>&quot;. But the
former Prime Minister who recovered the islands in 1982, also
reminded the Falklanders that &quot;<em>we must never take for
granted the bravery and generosity of America not the heroism and
service of those to whose sacrifice and sense of duty we will be
eternally in deb</em>t&quot;. </font></p>

face="Arial"><strong>STANLEY. (MP).- For the fourth year in
succession Argentine Foreign Secretary Guido Di Tella has sent a
Xmas gift to the islanders: this year 600 copies of the short
allegory &quot;</strong><em><strong>The Little Prince&quot;</strong></em><strong>,
written and illustrated by French author Antoine de Saint-Expury.</strong>
In the accompanying letter addressed &quot;<em>my dear neighbour</em>&quot;,
Di Tella explains why he picked this particular book: &quot;<em>a
delightful little book that the author says it was written for
grown ups full of imagination and dreams, who were children not
so long ago</em>&quot; Last year Di Tella sent a photograph of
his many grandchildren, several of whom he maintained were &quot;<em>foreigners</em>&quot;
because of their European background. In Xmas 1994 the gift was a
video cassette of the popular BBC series &quot;<em>Pingu the
Penguin</em>&quot;, while previously he had sent a coloured
postcard of Buenos Aires. Reaction in the islands to Di Tella's
charm policy as usual, was of indifference or regretful that
Argentine tax payers money was not used for a better purpose.
&quot;<em>This is a pointless exercise by an eccentric man</em>&quot;,
said Councilor John Birmingham. </font></p>

JOINT COOPERATION AREA</strong></font><font face="Arial"> </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>STANLEY (MP).- British and
Argentine representatives are working at full speed to ensure
that seismic surveying in the joint co-operation area can get
started by next February and the oil exploration licensing round
at the end of 1997</strong>. The 18.000 square kilometres special
joint co-operation area in the South Atlantic, (where Argentine
and Falklands-Malvinas waters overlap), was created in the 1995
New York oil agreement between Prime Minister Major and President
Menem. Phyllis Rendell Director of the Oil Department of the
Falklands-Malvinas just back from a meeting of the South Atlantic
Hydrocarbons Committee (SAHC), held in London, said that the
basic idea behind the co-operation is that levels and standards
for the oil industry are made extensive to the whole South
Atlantic. <em>&quot;We will encourage companies working on our
waters to participate in activities in the special co-operation
area</em>&quot;, underlined Mrs. Rendell. Mrs. Rendell said that
the SAHC is drafting proposals to ensure that both governments
equally share income generated in the special area and has also
received several proposals to outline the trenches. &quot;<em>Two
seismic companies are already interested in operating which we
expect could begin next February, and by the end of '97 the oil
licensing round should be launched</em>&quot;, remarked Mrs.
Rendell. But in spite of the overall optimism and the 1998
timetable agreed during the SAHC meeting, Mrs. Rendell warned
that there is an enormous work load ahead since the Argentine and
British licensing systems are so radically different. Experts of
the SAHC are scheduled to meet again next March in Buenos Aires.</font></p>
