<p> The total number of prisoners under the jurisdiction of
Federal or State correctional authorities was 1,053,738 at
yearend 1994. During the year the States and the District of
Columbia added 78,847 prisoners; the Federal system, 5,447.
Although the 1994 growth rate (8.6%) nearly equaled the average
annual percent increase since 1980, the total increase of 83,294
was the second largest yearly increase on record. </p>

<p> * California (125,605) and Texas (118,195) together held more
than 1 in every 5 inmates in the Nation. Seventeen States, each
holding fewer than 5,000 inmates, together held 4% of all
prisoners. </p>

<p> * At yearend 1994, State prisons were operating at between
17% and 29% above capacity, while the Federal system was
operating at 25% over capacity. </p>

<p> * Since 1980 the Nation's prison population more than doubled
on a per capita basis. On December 31, 1994, the number of
sentenced prisoners per 100,000 U.S. residents was 387-up from
139 in 1980. </p>

<p> * States with the highest incarceration rates were Texas
(636), Louisiana (530), and Oklahoma (508). North Dakota (78) had
the lowest rate, followed by Minnesota (100), West Virginia
(106), and Maine (118). </p>

<p> * In 1993 (the latest available data), the incarceration rate
of blacks was 7 times that of whites. At yearend there were 1,471
black inmates per 100,000 black U.S. residents compared to 207
white inmates per 100,000 white residents. </p>

<ul>
    <li>The percentage of State prisoners serving a drug sentence
        increased almost 3-fold from 1980 to 1993 (6% to 22%).
        The percentage of Federal prisoners serving a drug
        sentence more than doubled, from 25% in 1980 to 60% in
        1993. </li>
    <li>In recent years, although the number of drug offenders in
        the Nation's prisons grew dramatically (55,500 from 1990
        to 1993), the number of violent offenders grew the most
        (up 82,100). </li>

<p> -------------------------------------- </p>

<p> State and Federal prisons housed two-thirds of all persons
incarcerated in the United States--the other third were in local
jails. </p>

<p> The 1994 growth rate of 8.6% was greater than the percentage
increase recorded during 1993 (7.4%). The 1994 increase
translates into a nationwide need to confine an additional 1,602
inmates each week. </p>

<p> Prisoners with a sentence of more than 1 year (referred to as
&quot;sentenced prisoners&quot;) accounted for 96% of the total
prison population at the end of 1994, growing by 8.6 % during the
year. The remaining prisoners had sentences of a year or less or
were unsentenced (for example, those awaiting trial in States
with combined prison-jail systems). </p>

<p> The number of sentenced Federal prisoners increased less than
that of sentenced State prisoners during 1994 (7.3% versus 8.7%).
The rate of increase slowed to about half the 1993 growth rate. </p>

<p> During 1994 prison populations increased in 16 States by at
least 10%. Texas reported the largest increase (28.5%), followed
by Georgia (20.3%), Nevada (16.0%), Virginia (14.6%), and
Wisconsin (14.1%). Three States and the District of Columbia
experienced less than 2% growth. The District had the smallest
percentage growth (.9%), followed by Oklahoma (1.4%), South
Carolina (1.6%), and Massachusetts (1.6%). </p>

<p> Fifty-six percent of the increase during 1994 was accounted
for by Texas (26,182), California (5,654), Georgia (5,642), the
Federal system (5,447), and Florida (4,091). These jurisdictions
incarcerate over 40% of the Nation's prison population. </p>

<p> * At yearend 1980, 1 in every 453 U.S. residents were
incarcerated; by yearend 1993, that figure grew to 1 in every
189. </p>

<p> * From 1980 to 1993, the total number of persons held in the
custody of State, Federal, and local jail jurisdictions grew by
about 863,000 persons. Sixty-two percent of the growth can be
attributed to the growth in number of State prisoners (533,000). </p>

<ul>
    <li>Between 1980 and 1993, the Federal prison population grew
        at faster rate (an average of 9.9% per year) than the
        combined State populations (8.2%) and the Nation's local
        jail populations (7.3%). Despite the higher growth rate,
        only 5.9% of all inmates were held in Federal prisons in
        1993, up from 4.7% in 1980. </li>
    <li>* On December 31, 1993, almost 4.9 million persons were
        under some form of correctional supervision, including
        2.8 million adults on probation and 671,000 on parole.
        The percentage distribution of the total corrections
        population was-- </li>

<p> Confinement 28.0% </p>

<p> Federal prisons 1.7 </p>

<p> State prisons 17.0 </p>

<p> Local jails 9.3 </p>

<p> Community supervision 72.0% </p>

<p> Parole 13.7 </p>

<p> Probation 58.3 </p>

<p> * Between 1980 and 1993, the number of persons under
correctional supervision increased by more than 3 million. About
19% of this increase occurred because of the growth in the State
and Federal prison populations. </p>

<p> * * * </p>

<p> Rates of incarceration increase </p>

<p> On December 31, 1994, the number of sentenced prisoners per
100,000 U.S. residents was 387. Of the 14 States with rates
greater than the rate for the Nation, 11 were in the South, 2
were in the West, and 1 was in the Midwest. Four States, North
Dakota (78), Minnesota (100), West Virginia (106), and Maine
(118) had rates that were less than a third of the national rate.
</p>

<p> The District of Columbia, a wholly urban jurisdiction, held
1,583 sentenced prisoners per 100,000 residents at yearend 1994.
Since 1980 the number of sentenced inmates per 100,000 residents
has risen from 139 to 387. During this period, per capita
incarceration rates rose the most in the South (from 188 to 451)
and West (from 105 to 333). The rate in the Northeast rose from
87 to 285, and the rate in the Midwest from 109 to 297. The
number of sentenced Federal prisoners per 100,000 residents
increased from 9 to 30 over the same period. </p>

<p> Prison populations in Southern States grew the fastest </p>

<p> During 1994 the average growth in the number of sentenced
State and Federal prisoners was equal to a demand for 1,542
additional bed spaces per week, about 179 more than the average
weekly growth in 1993. </p>

<p> Regionally, during 1994 the percentage increase in the number
of sentenced prisoners was highest in the Southern States, a gain
of 13.1%. The number of sentenced prisoners grew by 6.2% in the
West, 5.8% in the Midwest, and 4.1% in the Northeast. In 29
States the percentage change in the number of sentenced prisoners
during 1994 was higher than that of 1993. </p>

<p> Among these jurisdictions, 16 had increases of at least 10%.
They were led by Texas (28.3%), Georgia (20.1%), Virginia
(14.9%), New Hampshire (13.9%), and Idaho (13.7%). In five States
(Delaware, Maine, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and Massachusetts)
and the District of Columbia the number of sentenced prisoners
increased by less than 2%. In two States--Alaska and
Connecticut--the number of sentenced prisoners declined during
1994. Since 1989 net gains in the number of sentenced prisoners
have averaged about 1,162 prisoners per week--a gain of about
1,036 State prisoners and 125 Federal prisoners per week over the
period. The largest net gains occurred in the South (500 inmates
per week), followed by the West (213 inmates per week), the
Midwest (180 inmates per week), and the Northeast (144 inmates
per week). Texas accounted for 34% of the total growth in the 16
Southern States and the District of Columbia. California
accounted for two-thirds of the growth in the 13 Western States. </p>

<p> In 1994 the 10 States with the largest prison populations
held 55% of the total prison population nationwide, with
California, Texas, and New York accounting for nearly 30%. Texas
had the highest incarceration rate, with 636 sentenced prisoners
per 100,000 residents, followed by Louisiana (530) and Oklahoma
(508). </p>

<p> During 1994 the prison population in Texas grew the fastest,
increasing 28.5%. Over the past 5 years the State prison
population of New Hampshire grew the fastest, increasing 73.3%.
At yearend 1994 North Dakota had the lowest rate of incarceration
(78 sentenced prisoners per 100,000 residents), followed by
Minnesota (100), West Virginia (106), and Maine (118). </p>

<p> Seventeen States, each holding fewer than 5,000 inmates,
together held 4% of all prisoners in 1994. </p>

<p> The number of sentenced inmates has increased in every State
since 1989. Alaska (up 1.4% since 1989) and Maine (up 2.2%) had
the smallest percentage increases. Four other States had
increases of less than 20% in the last 5 years. Kansas had a
5-year rate of growth of 13.5%, followed by Nebraska (13.7%), New
Mexico (17.9%), and Wyoming (18.6%). </p>

<p> Female prisoner population grew at a faster pace The number
of female inmates (64,403) increased at a faster rate during 1994
(10.6%) than the number of male inmates (989,335 at 8.5%). </p>

<p> At the end of 1994 women accounted for 6.1% of all prisoners
nationwide. Relative to the number of women in the resident
population in the States in 1994, Oklahoma (with 96 female
inmates per 100,000 female residents) and Texas (with 94) led the
Nation. North Dakota (5 per 100,000) and Maine (9) had the lowest
female incarceration rates. In 1994, 28 States, the District of
Columbia, and the Federal system had more than 500 female
inmates. Among these jurisdictions, 14 had increases of at least
10%, led by the Texas increase of 27.2% (from 6,949 in 1993 to
8,839 in 1994). </p>

<p> Six States held fewer than 100 female inmates at yearend
1994. Women represented less than 4% of all prisoners in North
Dakota, Montana, and Vermont. In 1994, 7.5% of inmates in the
Federal system were female--higher than all State systems except
for Oklahoma (9.7%), Hawaii (7.7%), and Texas (7.5%). </p>

<p> Local jails held almost 49,000 prisoners because of State
prison crowding At the end of 1994, 23 jurisdictions reported a
total of 48,949 State prisoners held in local jails or
otherfacilities because of crowding in State facilities. Texas
accounted for 42% of the prisoners sentenced to prison but
incarcerated locally. Eight States--Louisiana, Texas, Virginia,
West Virginia, Mississippi, New Jersey, Tennessee, and
Idaho--held more than 10% of their prison population in local
jails. Overall, because of prison crowding, 4.6% of the State
prisoners were confined in local jails, down from 5.2% in 1993. </p>

<p> Prison capacity estimates are difficult to compare The extent
of crowding in the Nation's prisons is difficult to determine
because of the absence of uniform measures for defining capacity.
The 52 reporting jurisdictions apply a wide variety of capacity
measures to reflect both available space to house inmates and the
ability to staff and operate an institution. To estimate the
capacity of the Nation's prisons, jurisdictions were asked to
supply three measures for yearend 1994: rated, operational, and
design capacities. These measures were defined as follows: </p>

<p> Rated capacity is the number of beds or inmates assigned by a
rating official to institutions within the jurisdiction. </p>

<p> Operational capacity is the number of inmates that can be
accommodated based on a facility's staff, existing programs, and
services. </p>

<p> Design capacity is the number of inmates that planners or
architects intended for the facility. </p>

<p> Of the 52 reporting jurisdictions, 38 supplied rated
capacities, 43 provided operational capacities, and 37 submitted
design capacity. As a result, estimates of total capacity and
measures of the relationship to population are based on the
highest and lowest capacity figures provided. (Twenty-five
jurisdictions reported 1 capacity measure or gave the same figure
for each capacity measure they reported.) </p>

<p> Most jurisdictions are operating above capacity Prisons
generally require reserve capacity to operate efficiently.
Dormitories and cells need to be maintained and repaired
periodically, special housing is needed for protective custody
and disciplinary cases, and space may be needed to cope with
emergencies. At the end of 1994, 13 States and the District of
Columbia reported that they were operating at or below 99% of
their highest capacity. Forty-one States, the District of
Columbia and the Federal prison system reported operating at 100%
or more of their lowest capacity. By yearend, the Federal system
was estimated to be operating at 25% over capacity. </p>

<p> State prisons were estimated to be operating at 117% of their
highest capacity and 129% of their lowest capacity. </p>

<p> Changing demographic characteristics </p>

<p> The demographic characteristics of the Nation's prison
population are changing. Since 1980 the number of female inmates
in the Nation's prisons has increased at a faster rate (up an
average 12.0% per year) than the number of male inmates (up an
average 8.5% per year.) Despite their faster population growth,
females comprised only 6% of all sentenced prisoners at yearend
1994. In 1994 the male incarceration rate, 746 per 100,000 male
residents, was more than 16 times higher than the female
incarceration rate--45 per 100,000 female residents. Increasing
percentages of State and Federal inmates are from racial or
ethnic minority groups. Between 1980 and 1993, the latest
available data, the percent of sentenced inmates who were black
rose from 46.5% to 50.8%. Relative to the number of residents in
the U.S. population, blacks at yearend 1993 were 7 times more
likely than whites to have been incarcerated in a State or
Federal prison. An estimated 1,471 blacks per 100,000 black
residents and 207 whites per 100,000 white residents were
incarcerated in the Nation's prisons on December 31, 1993. </p>

<p> The number of prisoners with sentences of more than a year
rose 616,292 between 1980 and 1993 (up 195%). The number of white
males grew 163%, the number of black males 217%, the number of
white females 327%, and the number of black females 343%. </p>

<p> The growth in the number of black male prisoners (304,800)
accounted for nearly half of the total increase during the
13-year period. </p>

<p> Hispanics, who may be of any race, are the fastest growing
minority group--increasing from 7.7% of all State and Federal
inmates in 1980 to 14.3% in 1993. During this period, the
Hispanic incarceration rate more than tripled--from 163 sentenced
prisoners per 100,000 Hispanic residents in 1980 to 529 per
100,000 Hispanic residents in 1993. At yearend 1993 nearly
139,000 Hispanics were in State or Federal prisons. </p>

<p> The total number of Hispanic inmates may actually be somewhat
larger. Because of variations in record keeping, some States are
unable to report data on Hispanic origin; other States report
estimates only; and others report only partial counts. Data from
past surveys of State inmates, which are based on inmate
self-identification during personal interviews, produce higher
estimates of the number of Hispanic inmates. </p>

<p> On December 31, 1993, nearly two-thirds of all sentenced
prison inmates were black, Asian, Native American, or Hispanic.
Growth linked to increasing numbers of inmates in prison for
violent and drug offenses </p>

<p> The distribution of the four major offense
categories--violent, property, drug, and public-order
offenses--changed dramatically in the Nation's prison population
between 1980 and 1993. As a percentage of all State and Federal
inmates, violent offenders fell from 57% in 1980 to 45% in 1993,
property offenders fell from 30% to 22%, drug offenders rose from
8% to 26%, and public-order offenders rose from 5% to 7%. </p>

<p> The rise in the number of drug offenders was the greatest
among Federal inmates. Prisoners sentenced for drug law
violations were the single largest group of Federal inmates (60%)
in 1993, up from 25% in 1980. The increase in drug offenders
accounted for nearly three-quarters of the total growth in
Federal inmates. </p>

<p> The percentage of inmates in State prison for a drug crime
also rose significantly, from 6% in 1980 to 22% in 1993. Nearly
10 times as many inmates were serving time in State prisons for
drug offenses in 1993 (186,000) as in 1980 (19,000). </p>

<p> In absolute numbers, however, the growth in State inmates was
greatest among violent offenders. Between 1980 and 1993, the
number of violent offenders grew by 221,200, while the number of
drug offenders grew by 167,000. As a percentage of the total
growth in sentenced State inmates during the period, violent
offenders accounted for 42% of the total growth, drug offenders
31%, property offenders 19%, and public-order offenders 7%. </p>

<p> Average sentence length and time served for State inmates
relatively unchanged </p>

<p> Data on prison admissions and releases collected annually in
the National Corrections Reporting Program (NCRP) suggest that
growth in the State prison populations has not been the result of
longer sentences. (Each year participating States provide
information on sentencing and time served for persons entering or
leaving prison. In 1993, 38 States and the District of Columbia
submitted data, accounting for nearly 93% of all admissions and
85% of all releases nationwide during the year.) Between 1985 and
1992, years in which comparable data are available, the average
(mean) maximum sentences of prisoners actually declined from 78
months to 67 months. </p>

<p> The median sentence length (the 50th percentile) of prisoners
admitted from court remained constant at 48 months. Moreover,
despite the increasing use of mandatory minimums and sentencing
enhancements during the period, the percent of inmates who
received a maximum sentence of 10 years or longer actually
declined (from 19.7% in 1985 to 17.7% in 1992). </p>

<p> The NCRP data also reveal no significant changes in the time
served by offenders released from State prison during the period.
In 1992 State prisoners released for the first time on their
current offense (that is, first releases) served an average of 22
months in prison and 5 months in jail. (Time served in jail is
the amount of time an inmate spends in jail prior to entering
State prison and is credited towards time served on the total
sentence.) The amount of time served in prison was slightly lower
in 1985 (20 months), higher in 1986 (24 months), and about the
same since 1987 (22 months). </p>

<p> These data reflect the time served by prisoners actually
released. Some prisoners will never be released but will die in
prison. Some prisoners with very long sentences do not show up
among released prisoners for many years. As a result, measures of
time served based on released prisoners tend to understate the
actual time to be served by persons entering prison. </p>

<p> Changing Federal sentencing linked to population growth </p>

<p> The Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 introduced &quot;truth in
sentencing&quot; to the Federal justice system. The Act created a
commission that specified sentencing guidelines, which went into
effect in late 1987. The guidelines took into account the gravity
of the crime and the offender's criminal record. Under the
guidelines offenders convicted of Federal offenses are expected
to serve a minimum of 85% of the actual sentence. </p>

<p> After 1986 the average Federal sentence to prison for violent
crimes decreased, while overall time served increased. The result
is a rapidly growing Federal prison population. After 1986 the
average time served by persons released from Federal prison rose
from 15 months to 24 months (a 60% increase). For violent
offenses, the time served by first releases increased from 50
months to 56 months and for drug offenses, time served increased
from 22 months to 33 months. </p>

<p> The sentencing reforms also increased the likelihood of
incarceration for convicted Federal offenders. </p>

<p> Between 1980 and 1992 the number of defend-ants convicted in
U.S. district courts rose from 29,943 to 51,936, and the
percentage sent to prison increased from 46% to 75%. As a result,
the number of offenders sent to Federal prisons rose from 13,766
to 33,622--an increase of 144%. (&quot;Federal Criminal Case
Processing, 1980-90,&quot; September 1992, NCJ-136945;
&quot;Federal Criminal Case Processing, 1982-91, With Preliminary
Data for 1992,&quot; November 1993, NCJ-144526.) </p>

<p> Rise in State prison population the result of increasing
number of arrests and higher probabilities of incarceration </p>

<p> Underlying the growth in the State prison population has been
an increase in the number of arrests from nearly 8.3 million
adult arrests in 1980 to 11.6 million in 1993. Although the total
grew by nearly 41%, for some offenses the percent increase was
substantially greater: simple assault (139%), drug abuse
violations (116%), aggravated assault (86%). Compounding the
impact of more adult arrests for selected serious offenses, the
rate of sending offenders to prison rose between 1980 and 1992
(the latest year for which data are available). Except for murder
and nonnegligent manslaughter, the number of admissions to State
prison per 1,000 arrests for serious crimes rose significantly.
The likelihood of incarceration upon arrest increased 5-fold for
drug violations, increased 4-fold for weapons offenses, and
doubled for larceny/theft, motor vehicle theft, and sexual
assault other than rape. </p>

<p> As a result of the compounding nature of these factors, the
number of admissions to State prisons from court rose from
131,215 sentenced prisoners in 1980 to 318,069 in 1993, an
increase of 142%. </p>

<p> Methodology </p>

<p> National Prisoner Statistics </p>

<p> This Bulletin is based on an advance count of prisoners
conducted for the National Prisoner Statistics (NPS) program
immediately after the end of each calendar year. A detailed,
final count containing any revisions to the jurisdictions'
advance count will be published later. </p>

<p> Most States provide jurisdiction counts, that is, the number
of inmates under their jurisdiction on December 31, regardless of
the location of their inmates. These counts exclude inmates
housed for other jurisdictions, such as other State's inmates and
pretrial detainees, that are housed in a jurisdiction's
facilities. </p>

<p> Some States provide custody counts, that is, the number of
inmates housed in State facilities regardless of jurisdiction.
(See Jurisdiction notes.) These counts exclude inmates housed
outside of each State's prison facilities, such as inmates housed
in local jails. Custody counts are used to calculate the total
number of inmates in prisons and jails. </p>

<p> Estimation procedures </p>

<p> The offense distributions of State prisoners at yearend were
estimated for 1980, 1985, and 1990-93. To obtain estimates of the
custody populations by offense, data from inmate surveys
conducted in 1979, 1986, and 1991, were combined with counts by
offense of annual admissions and releases. The surveys provided
the basis for estimating the offense distributions of the other
years. </p>

<p> The offense distributions were estimating using forward and
backward stock-flow procedures as outlined in Correction
Populations in the United States, 1992 (January 1995,
NCJ-146413). Data from the 1979 survey were used for forward
estimates for 1980; data from the 1986 survey (conducted in March
1986) were used for 1985 estimates, 1990 forward estimates, and
1980 backward estimates; and data from the 1991 survey for 1991
estimates and 1992-93 forward estimates. </p>

<p> To obtain flow populations for each year, the offense
distributions of admissions and releases were drawn from annual
reports of the National Prisoner Statistics (1980-82) program and
the National Corrections Reporting Program (1983-92). Data from
the 1992 NCRP were used to estimate flows for 1993. </p>

<p> The offense distributions of Federal inmates are for
prisoners of any sentence length on September 30 in 1980 and
1985. Data for 1990-93 are taken from the BJS Federal justice
database. </p>

<p> Jurisdiction notes </p>

<p> Indiana--Prison population counts include 903 inmates who
were housed in local jails as of December 31, 1994, because of
crowding of State facilities. Another floor was opened in a
facility to accommodate a larger number of inmates; as a result,
capacity was increased and some crowding was reduced. </p>

<p> Iowa--Population counts are based on custody data. </p>

because of crowding of State facilities. </p>

<p> Maine--Maine has a number of inmates serving concurrent
sentences some of which are 1 year or more and some 1 year or
less. These inmates are not included in the prison population
counts. </p>

<p> Maryland--Population totals are actual manual counts;
however, the breakdowns for sentence length are estimates. </p>

<p> Massachusetts--Population counts are based on jurisdictional
data for the first time. For this report custody counts for
December 31, 1993, were updated to jurisdictional counts.
Population counts exclude the 963 inmates housed in local jails
because of crowding of State facilities. Population totals are
actual counts, however, the male/female breakdown is an estimate

counts include 336 inmates without sentence information. </p>

<p> Michigan--Population counts are based on custody data. </p>

<p> Minnesota--Population counts include 85 inmates housed in
local jails as of December 31, 1994, because of crowding of State
facilities. </p>

<p> Mississippi--Population counts are as of December 30, 1994.
Population counts include 1,569 inmates housed in local jail as

<p> New Jersey--&quot;Design&quot; capacity does not include
persons held in halfway houses (686) and persons held under the
county assistance program (846). </p>

<p> North Carolina--While population totals are actual counts,
the breakdowns for sentence length are estimates. Because of
crowding 248 male inmates were housed in local jails; another 937
male inmates were housed in private prisons out of State on a
contractual basis. The total of 1,185 male inmates are included
in the population counts. </p>

<p> Oklahoma--Population counts for &quot;Inmates with over 1
year maximum sentence&quot; may include a small undetermined

<p> Oregon--An undetermined number of inmates for which sentence
length is unknown is included in the count for &quot;Inmates with
a sentence of 1 year or less.&quot; </p>

<p> Pennsylvania--The design capacity figure increased because
several sections in different facilities opened. This State now
treats the rated, operational, and design capacity the same. </p>

<p> Rhode Island--Prisons and jails form one integrated system.
All NPS data include prison and jail populations. </p>

<p> South Carolina--Population counts include 359 inmates who
were housed in local jails as of December 31, 1994, because of
crowding of State facilities. </p>

<p> Tennessee--Population counts for &quot;Inmates with over 1

jails because of overcrowding and exclude an undetermined number
offelons sentenced to serve their time in local jails. (The State
pays to house these felons, but the local court maintains
jurisdiction.) These counts are based on a jail report from
December 16, 1994. </p>

<p> Texas--Population counts for December 31, 1994, include
20,720 inmates housed in local jails because of crowding. In
Texas the minimum sentence for any offender sentenced to a State
prison is 2 years. </p>

<p> Utah--Population counts include 169 inmates housed in local
jails because of crowding of State facilities. </p>

<p> Vermont--Prisons and jails form an integrated system. All NPS
data include prison and jail populations. Some county and
municipal authorities operate local &quot;lockups.&quot; NPS data
include the inmates in local &quot;lockups&quot;. Population
counts for sentenced inmates include 305 who were on long-term
furlough. The rated capacity figures decreased due to the closing
of one facility for renovations. </p>

<p> Virginia--Virginia uses a base capacity method to determine
the rated, operational, and design capacity figures. Under this
method of determining capacity, only the bunks that touch the
floor are counted; top bunks are not counted. Population counts
include 4,508 inmates who were housed in local jails because of
crowding of State facilities. </p>

<p> West Virginia--Population counts are based oncustody data.
Population counts exclude 383 male and 15 female inmates housed
in county or regional jails because of crowding of State
facilities. </p>

<p> Washington--Offenders sentenced to 1 year or less and
unsentenced offenders reside in county jails. Capacities reported
exclude state work release and pre-release facilities which
housed 918 inmates on December 31, 1994. These facilities'
capacity of 1,102 inmates are not specifically reserved for State
prison inmates. These facilities are for prison inmates,
parolees, probationers, and offenders serving partial confinement
sentences. <br>

<p> The number of inmates held in the Nation's local jails on
June 30, 1994, reached a record high of 490,442. Local jails,
which are operated by counties and municipalities and
administered by local government agencies, housed about a third
of all persons incarcerated in the U.S. at midyear 1994; the
other two-thirds were in State or Federal prisons. </p>

<p> The jail population grew by 30,638 inmates between July 1,
1993, and June 30, 1994, the third largest annual increase
recorded since 1983. The 12-month increase was the equivalent of
a 6.7% rate of growth. </p>

<p> Between 1983 and 1993, when comparable statistics were
collected, the number of local jail employees grew at a faster
rate than the number of inmates. During this period, the number
of jail inmates increased at an annual rate of 7.5%, while the
number of full-time and part-time jail employees grew at an
annual rate of 10%. By midyear 1993, local jails employed an
estimated 165,500 persons. </p>

<p> Highlights </p>

<p> After a decade of record growth, the number of inmates in
local jails reached a high of 490,442 on June 30, 1994 </p>

<p> * The number of jail inmates per 100,000 U.S. residents
increased from 96 in 1983 to 188 in 1994. </p>

<p> * In 1993, 8 States had over 200 local jail inmates per
100,000 residents: Louisiana (377), Georgia (328), Texas (307),
Tennessee (282), Florida (250), Virginia (225), California (222),
and Nevada (215). </p>

<p> * Between 1983 and 1993 the number of jail inmates increased
106%; the total jail staff increased 156%; and the number of
correctional officers grew 165%. </p>

<p> * At midyear 1994 the capacity of the Nation's local jails
was 504,324 inmates, as measured by the number of beds allotted
by State or local rating officials. </p>

<p> * The jail population was 97% of rated capacity. Jail space
increased 93% between 1983 and 1994. </p>

<p> * White non-Hispanics made up 39% of the jail population;
black non-Hispanics, 44%; Hispanics, 15%; and non-Hispanics of
other races, 2%. </p>

<p> Factors underlying the growth in the Nation's jail population
included: </p>

<p> * an increase in adult arrests </p>

<p> * a growth in jail admissions </p>

<p> * an increased number of felons sentenced to local jails </p>

<p> * an increased number of inmates charged with or convicted of
drug offenses </p>

<p> * more inmates held in jails because of crowded State or
Federal facilities. </p>

<p> Data sources </p>

<p> The data in this report are based on results from the 1993
Census of Jails and the 1994 Annual Survey of Jails. Every 5
years the jail census collections provide detailed information on
local jail inmates, staff, facilities, and programs. Previous
censuses were conducted in 1970, 1972, 1978, 1983, and 1988.
Beginning in 1982 and in years between each jail census, a sample
of jails has been surveyed to obtain basic information on inmates
and jail capacity. These annual surveys provide national-level
estimates on fewer characteristics than the census. (See
Methodology at end.) </p>

<p> As defined in this report, jails are locally operated
correctional facilities that confine persons before or after
adjudication. Inmates sentenced to jail usually have a sentence
of a year or less, but jails also incarcerate persons in a wide
variety of other categories. </p>

<p> Jails-- </p>

<p> * receive individuals pending arraignment and hold them
awaiting trial, conviction, or sentencing </p>

<ul>
    <li>readmit probation, parole, and bail-bond violators and
        absconders </li>
    <li>* temporarily detain juveniles pending transfer to
        juvenile authorities </li>
</ul>

<p> * hold mentally ill persons pending their movement to
appropriate health facilities </p>

<p> * hold individuals for the military, for protective custody,
for contempt, and for the courts as witnesses </p>

<ul>
    <li>release convicted inmates to the community upon
        completion of sentence </li>
    <li>* transfer inmates to Federal, State, or other
        authorities </li>
</ul>

<p> * relinquish custody of temporary detainees to juvenile and
medical authorities </p>

<p> * sometimes operate community-based programs with electronic
monitoring or other types of supervision. </p>

<p> Not included in the survey or census are inmates in six
States with combined jail and prison systems. At midyear 1994
these States-Alaska (except for 5 local jails), Connecticut,
Delaware, Hawaii, Rhode Island, and Vermont--held nearly 6,000
inmates who were unsentenced or had sentences of less than a
year. These inmates and the facilities that house them are
included in BJS prison statistics. </p>

<p> The 1993 Census of Jails also included, for the first time,
seven Federal facilities that perform the pretrial functions of
local jails. Data on these Federal facilities and inmates are
reported separately. (See the section on Federal jails.) </p>

<p> Local jail inmates </p>

<p> On June 30, 1994, the Nation's jails held 490,442 inmates, an
increase of 6.7% over the number held on June 30, 1993. The jail
population grew by more than 30,000 inmates during the 12-month
period, the third largest increase ever recorded. </p>

<p> Since 1983 the jail inmate population has nearly doubled on a
per capita basis. During this period, the number of jail inmates
per 100,000 residents rose from 96 to 188. At midyear 1994 about
1 in every 398 adult residents of the United States was in a
local jail. </p>

<p> An estimated 6,725 persons under age 18 were housed in adult
jails on June 30, 1994. Over three-quarters of them had been
convicted or were being held for trial as adults in criminal
court. Most juveniles in correctional custody are housed in
juvenile facilities. </p>

<p> Who is a juvenile? </p>

<p> Most, but not all, States define a juvenile as a person under
age 18 who is subject to juvenile court jurisdiction. Exceptions
usually depend on offense severity or an offender's adjudication
history. In the 1993 census and 1994 survey, to achieve reporting
uniformity, jail authorities were asked to report the number of
inmates under age 18. Of the 6,725 total in 1994, 76% were
identified as juveniles tried or scheduled to be tried as adults.
Statutes and judicial practice some- times allow youths to be
held in adult jails. Often juveniles accused of acts that are
crimes for adults may be held in local jails or police lockups,
given certain conditions: </p>

<p> * separated by sight and sound from the general population </p>

<p> * held for a limited time, typically less than 6 hours. </p>

<p> Most confined juveniles are housed in institutions specified
for them. In 1993 about 96,000 were in public and private
juvenile detention and correctional facilities. </p>

<p> The average daily population for the year ending June 30,
1994, was 479,757, an increase of 2.9% from 1993. Between 1983
and 1993, when separate counts by sex were collected, the average
daily population of female inmates grew at a faster rate (up
11.1% per year) than the average daily population of adult male
inmates (up 7.1% per year). </p>

<p> States with the largest jail populations </p>

<p> In 1993, 5 States incarcerated slightly less than half of all
local jail inmates: California (69,298 inmates), Texas (55,395),
Florida (34,183), New York (29,809), and Georgia (22,663).
Twenty-one States reported a jailpopulation that more than
doubled between 1983 and 1993, with growth ranging from 103% in
Maryland to 264% in Texas. </p>

<p> States that had the largest number of jail inmates per
100,000 residents in 1993 were Louisiana (377), Georgia (328),
Texas (307), Tennessee (282), Florida (250), Virginia (225),
California (222), and Nevada (215). States with a jail
incarceration rate less than half that of the Nation (178 per
100,000) were Iowa, Maine, and North Dakota (57), Minnesota and
Montana (81), and South Dakota (87). </p>

<p> The number of local jail inmates rose the most in the South
and the least in the Midwest. From 1983 to 1993 the inmate
population grew 135% in the South, 102% in the Northeast, 81% in
the West, and 79% in the Midwest. </p>

<p> For the Nation a declining number of jails held these
increasing numbers of inmates. In 1993 the total of 3,304
facilities was 12 fewer than 5 years before and 34 fewer than in
1983. </p>

<p> Facility size and the percentage of the inmate population
held </p>

<p> A small number of jails held a disproportionate share of the
Nation's jail inmates. About 6% of the jail facilities housed
more than half of all jail inmates on June 30, 1993. Facilities
with an average daily population of 500 or more during the annual
period ending June 30, 1993, held 53% of local jail inmates.
Facilities with an average daily population of fewer than 50
persons comprised 57% of all jails but housed about 8% of all
inmates. </p>

<p> Demographic characteristics of local jail inmates </p>

<p> Male inmates made up 90% of the local jail inmate population
at midyear 1994, down from 93% in 1983. An estimated 1 in every
212 adult men and 1 in every 2,048 adult women were held in a
local jail on June 30, 1994. </p>

<p> On June 30, 1994, a majority of local jail inmates were black
or Hispanic. White non-Hispanics made up 39% of the jail
population; black non-Hispanics, 44%; Hispanics, 15%; and other
races (Asians, Pacific Islanders, American Indians and Alaska
Natives), 2%. </p>

<p> Relative to the number of residents in the U.S. population,
black non-Hispanics were more than twice as likely as Hispanics,
nearly 7 times more likely than white non-Hispanics, and over 9
times more likely than persons of other races to have been held
in a local jail on June 30, 1994. </p>

<p> Other race 7,700 74 </p>

<p> Note: U.S. resident populations were estimated. Inmate counts
were adjusted for nonresponse and rounded to the nearest 100.
Rates were based on relevant population subgroups. </p>

<p> Adult conviction status, mid-1993 </p>

<p> On June 30, 1993, the most recent date for available data, at
least half the Nation's adult jail inmates had been convicted on
their current charge. Convicted inmates include those awaiting
sentencing, serving a sentence, or returned to jail for a
violation of probation or parole. Between 1983 and 1993 the
reported number of convicted inmates more than doubled (from
107,660 to 226,600). The number of jail inmates awaiting court
disposition also doubled (from 113,984 to 228,900). </p>

<p> In 1993 female inmates were somewhat more likely than male
inmates to have been convicted. Among adult female inmates, 52%
had been convicted on their current charge, compared to 50% of
the male inmates. </p>

<p> Rated capacity and percent occupied At midyear 1994, the
rated capacity of the Nation's local jails totaled 504,324. Rated
capacity is the maximum number of beds or inmates allocated by
State or local rating officials to each jail facility. During the
12 months ending June 30, 1994, an estimated 29,100 beds were
added. Nearly a quarter of a million beds have been added since
1983. </p>

<p> As of June 30, 1994, 97% of the local jail capacity was
occupied. As measured by a ratio of the number of inmates housed
in jail facilities to the rated capacity, the percent of capacity
actually occupied may have been somewhat lower than 97%. Included
among the total jail inmates were an unknown number of inmates
housed outside of jail facilities--under electronic monitoring,
on house arrest, under other kinds of community supervision, or
temporarily in hospitals or treatment centers. </p>

<p> As a ratio of all inmates to capacity, the percent of
capacity occupied increased considerably after 1983, reaching a
record 108% in 1989 and then falling to 97% in 1993. Since 1989
rated capacity has risen by nearly 137,000 beds, while the number
of inmates has increased by 95,000. </p>

<p> In 1993 the total jail population exceeded jail capacity in
eight States and the District of Columbia. </p>

<p> Percent of jail </p>

<p> State capacity occupied </p>

<p> --------------------------------------- </p>

<p> Virginia 160% </p>

<p> South Carolina 124 </p>

<p> District of Columbia 121 </p>

<p> New Jersey 120 </p>

<p> Texas 115 </p>

<p> California 113 </p>

<p> Massachusetts 106 </p>

<p> Washington 102 </p>

<p> Pennsylvania 101 </p>

<p> In eight other States, excluding Alaska, the total jail
population was below 75% of the combined capacity of all local
jails. The lowest occupancy rates were in North Dakota (43%),
followed by Wyoming (52%), South Dakota (54%), and Montana (60%).
Between 1988 and 1993 the capacity of the Nation's local jails
increased by 40%, from 339,949 beds to 475,224. In eight States
the capacity of local jails increased by more than 60% during the
5-year period. Jails in New Hampshire and Massachusetts
experienced the largest percentage increase in capacity. During
this period the combined capacities of jails declined in the
following jurisdictions: West Virginia, Montana, and the District
of Columbia. </p>

<p> In every census year, facilities with the largest average
daily populations have reported the highest occupancy rates. In
1993 occupancy was 111% of rated capacity in jails with an
average population of 1,000 or more inmates, compared to 67% in
those with fewer than 50 inmates. </p>

<p> The 25 largest jail jurisdictions </p>

<p> In 1994 the Nation's 25 largest jail jurisdictions accounted
for 30% of all jail inmates. The jurisdictions were in 12 States:
7 in California; 5 in Texas; 4 in Florida; and 1 each in New
York, Illinois, Louisiana, Tennessee, Arizona, Pennsylvania,
Maryland, Georgia, and Michigan. </p>

<p> New York City's system, with 15 institutions, had the largest
number of facilities. </p>

<p> The two jurisdictions with the most inmates, Los Angeles
County and New York City, together held more than 38,284, or 8%
of the national total. </p>

<p> Overall, the 25 largest jurisdictions on June 30, 1994, had a
total population of 149,082 inmates, 10% more than the 135,060 a
year earlier. </p>

<p> In 1994, 15 jurisdictions reported having a larger average
daily population than in 1993. </p>

<p> Dallas County, Texas, reported the largest single year
growth--2,123 inmates--and the largest growth from 1988 to
1994--5,494. Shelby County (Memphis), Tennessee, reported the
largest decrease from 1993 to 1994--1,327 inmates. </p>

<p> Local jail employees </p>

<p> Local jails employed an estimated 165,500 persons on June 30,
1993. Including all full-time and part-time, payroll and
nonpayroll staff, the total staff grew by more than 100,000
between 1983 and 1993, an increase of 156%. </p>

<p> The staff total included 117,900 correctional officers, the
employees most responsible for providing a secure environment and
for directly supervising inmates. Correctional officers comprised
about 7 in every 10 jail employees in the 3 censuses, 1983-93. </p>

<p> Characteristics of local jail staff </p>

<p> At midyear 1993 men comprised 70% of all paid jail staff and
76% of correctional officers. Excluded were nonpayroll jail
employees, such as teachers or counselors, who were paid by
agencies other than jails. </p>

<p> Between 1988 and 1993 the female staff in local jails nearly
doubled, from 25,642 to an estimated 48,000. In 1993 nearly a
third of all paid staff and a quarter of correctional officers
were women. The race and ethnic composition of jail staff
remained unchanged between 1988 and 1993. White employees made up
an estimated 71% of the payroll jail staff in 1993, including 69%
of the correctional officers. </p>

<p> Blacks comprised 22% of all employees, including 23% of the
correctional officers. Hispanics accounted for 6% of the total
paid staff and 7% of correctional officers. </p>

<p> Inmate-to-staff ratios, 1993 </p>

<p> From 1983 to 1993 the number of U.S. jail employees increased
156%, as the number of correctional officers went up 165%. Jail
staffs in the Northeast had the largest percentage
increases--more than tripling in 10 years--while those in the
Midwest had the smallest, more than doubling. The South, the
region with the largest number of jail employees, registered the
greatest regional growth (75%) from 1988 to 1993. The West, with
less than half the number of employees in the South, also had the
least growth in staff (50%). Throughout the period, 1983-93, the
jail staff in the Nation and in every region grew more rapidly
than the inmate population. In 1993 jails held 2.8 inmates per
employee. The ratio in 1993 was almost a fifth lower than the 3.4
inmates per employee in 1988. </p>

<p> As a measure of workload, the number of inmates per
correctional officer also declined, from 4.7 in 1988 to 3.9 in
1993. All four regions had decreases in inmate-to-correctional
officer ratios. The West reported the sharpest decline, from 7.1
inmates per officer in 1983 to 5.3 in 1993. The smaller
facilities had fewer inmates per correctional officer (2.4) than
did larger jails (4.6 inmates per officer in the jails with a
1,000 or more inmates). The jails that were operating with an
inmate population at least 10% over their rated capacity had an
inmate-to-correctional officer ratio almost twice that of jails
with less than 75% of capacity occupied. Jails with 91% to 110%
of capacity filled employed a correctional officer for more than
every 4 inmates. </p>

<p> Annual jail expenditures </p>

<p> Local jails throughout the United States spent a total of
slightly over $9.6 billion during the year ending June 30, 1993.
This estimated total (not adjusted for inflation) was more than
double the $2.7 billion spent in 1983. </p>

<p> Approximately 71% of all reporting facilities were able to
provide data on expenditures in 1993. These jails reported total
annual expenditures were nearly $7.8 billion; operating costs,
about $5.5 billion; and capital expenditures, $2.2 billion. </p>

<p> Gross salaries and wages, employer contributions to employee
benefits, purchases of food, supplies, contractual services, and
other current operating costs accounted for 71% of expenditures.
Construction costs, major repairs, equipment, improvements, land
purchases, and other capital outlays accounted for the remaining
29%. In 1988, operating costs made up 78% of all expenditures and
capital outlays, 22%. </p>

<p> Average operating cost per inmate </p>

<p> Excluding capital outlays in 1993, the average cost to keep
one jail inmate incarcerated for a year was $14,667. Over 10
years the cost per inmate had risen 57% from $9,360. (Adjusted
for inflation to 1983 dollars the annual cost per inmate had
decreased by 11%.) The Northeast had the highest average
operating expenditure per inmate ($22,678) and the South, the
lowest ($11,697). Excluding Alaska and the District of Columbia,
average annual operating costs per inmate by State were highest
in New York ( $29,297) and lowest in Mississippi ($7,014). </p>

<p> Inmate deaths </p>

<p> During the year ending June 30, 1993, 647 inmate deaths
occurred in the jurisdiction of the jail authorities who provided
data on such deaths. Although asked to report the death of
inmates under the jurisdiction of jail authorities, regardless of
where the death took place, some facilities could report only
deaths that occurred on the jail premises. In addition, about 10%
of all jails were unable to report whether any inmate deaths had
occurred in 1993. </p>

<p> In 1993 illness was the leading cause of death in local jails
(45%), followed by suicide (36%). Acquired immune deficiency
syndrome (AIDS) accounted for about 10% of reported inmate
deaths; homicide, 3%; and other causes, 6%. </p>

<p> The death rate among jail inmates fell by more than a third
between 1983 and 1993, from 232 to 149 per 100,000 inmates. While
the rate of death from illness, including AIDS, remained
relatively constant over the period, the rate of suicide declined
sharply, from 129 per 100,000 in 1983, to 85 in 1988, to 54 in
1993. </p>

<p> Federal jails </p>

<p> In 1993 the Federal Bureau of Prisons maintained a small
number of detention facilities that functioned as jails. These
were not counted among the city, county, or regional adult
detention facilities called local jails in this report. Local
facilities, however, did hold about 12,000 persons for Federal
authorities, according to data reported by 90% of all facilities.
At midyear 1993 the Bureau of Prisons operated 7 jails, holding
5,899 persons who were awaiting adjudication or serving a
sentence, usually of a year or less. </p>

<p> Inmate demographics </p>

<p> Ninety-three percent of Federal jail inmates were men, a
slightly higher proportion than in local jails (90%). Seventy-two
percent were white, 25% were black, and 3% were Asians, Pacific
Islanders, American Indians, or Alaska Natives. </p>

<p> Conviction status </p>

<p> Slightly more than half of the Federal inmates were
unconvicted and were awaiting arraignment, trial, or the
completion of their trial. </p>

<p> Facility capacity </p>

<p> The 7 Federal jails had a combined rated capacity of
3,810-the population being 155% of that capacity. The percent
occupied was about 50% higher than that of local jails of
comparable size. </p>

<p> Inmate deaths </p>

<p> Eight inmates died while under the jurisdiction of Federal
jail authorities during the annual period ending June 30, 1993.
Four deaths resulted from illness or natural causes, two were
suicides, and two were drug overdoses. </p>

<p> Staff </p>

<p> Seventy-five percent of Federal jail employees were male, a
higher percentage than the 70% of employees for local facilities.
A majority of the Federal jail employees were correctional
officers. </p>

<p> Overall, there were 2.9 inmates per staff member in Federal
jails, about the same as in local facilities where the ratio was
2.8 inmates per employee. However, the number of inmates per
correctional officer (5.5) was higher than in local jails with
500 to 999 inmates (4.4). </p>

<p> Expenditures </p>

<p> Federal jail expenditures totaled slightly more than $166
million during the annual period ending June 30, 1993, excluding
those at the Guaynabo, Puerto Rico, facility, in operation only a
few months at the time of the census. Gross salaries and wages,
contributions to employee benefits, purchases of food, supplies,
contractual services, and other current operating costs accounted
for 76% of expenditures. Construction costs, major repairs,
equipment, improvements, land purchases, and other capital
outlays made up the remaining 24%. </p>

<p> The average cost to house one Federal jail inmate during the
year ending June 30, 1993, exclusive of capital expenditures was
$22,773, as compared to $14,667 among local jails. </p>

<p> Factors behind the growing jail population </p>

<p> An increasing number of arrests </p>

<p> Underlying the dramatic growth of the Nation's local jail
population after 1983 was a rise in the number of arrests from
11.7 million in 1983 to 14.0 million in 1993. Over the 10-year
period, the total number of arrests grew at an annual rate of
1.8%. For some offenses the annual rate of growth was
substantially greater: simple assault (7.6%), aggravated assault
(5.8%), drug abuse violations (5.4%), and weapons violations
(3.9%). </p>

<p> The increase in arrests resulted in a growing number of
admissions to local jails. On June 30, 1993, an estimated 26,800
persons were officially booked and admitted to local jails, and
an additional 9,500 inmates were transferred in from other
facilities or readmitted after having been temporarily released.
The estimated number of new admissions totaled nearly 9.8 million
for 1993, up from an estimated 6.0 million in the annual period
ending June 30, 1983. </p>

<p> Among inmates facing felony charges, the likelihood of being
held in a local jail prior to the disposition of their case
remained nearly the same between 1988 and 1992. Based on the
biennial National Pretrial Reporting Program (NPRP) that
describes State felony defendants in the Nation's 75 most
populous counties, an estimated 37% were held awaiting
disposition in 1992. Roughly the same percentage was detained in
1988 (34%) and 1990 (35%). (Pretrial Release of Felony
Defendants, BJS Bulletins, 1988 [February 1991, NCJ-127202], 1990
[November 1992, NCJ-139560], and 1992 [November 1994,
NCJ-148818]). </p>

<p> More felons sentenced to local jail </p>

<p> The impact of more arrests and jail admissions was compounded
by a growing number of felons receiving a sentence to local jail.
Between 1986 and 1992 the number of convicted felons sentenced to
confinement in local jails almost doubled: </p>

<p> 1986-92 90% </p>

<p> Source: Felony Sentences in State Courts (1986, 1988, 1990,
and 1992). </p>

<p> Jail inmates received about the same average sentences Growth
in the local jail population between 1983 and 1993 was not the
result of longer sentences. Results from the National Judicial
Reporting Program (NJRP) indicate that between 1988 and 1992,
years in which comparable data on felons sentenced to local jails
are available, the average (mean) maximum jail sentence among
those entering jail remained constant. In 1988 and 1992 felons
sentenced to local jail received a mean sentence of 7 months.
(Felony Sentences in State Courts, BJS Bulletins, 1988 [December
1990, NCJ-126923], 1990 [March 1993, NCJ-149077], and 1992
[January 1995, NCJ-151167]). </p>

<p> Data from the 1983 and 1989 surveys of inmates in local jails
also reveal no significant changes in the sentence lengths
received by sentenced inmates overall, including felons and
misdemeanants. About 50% of the jail inmates had been convicted
and sentenced at the time of both surveys. (Profile of Jail
Inmates, 1989, BJS Special Report [April 1991, NCJ-129097]).
Between 1983 and 1989, there was an increase in the mean sentence
(from 14 months to 17 months) but no change in the median. In
both years half of the sentenced inmates had received a sentence
of 6 months or less. </p>

<p> More drug offenders incarcerated in local jails </p>

<p> The largest source of growth among inmates in local jails was
drug law violators. Based on data from inmate surveys in 1983 and
1989, the number of jail inmates charged or convicted of drug
offenses rose from 20,800 to 91,000. In 1983 about 1 of every 10
inmates were in jail for a drug offense; in 1989 nearly 1 of
every 4 were in jail for drugs. From 1983 to 1989 the increase in
the number of persons in jail for drug offenses accounted for
more than 40 percent of the total increase in the jail
population. </p>

<p> Between 1983 and 1989 the percentage of jail inmates
decreased for violent offenses (from 30.7% to 22.5%) and property
offenses (from 38.6% to 30.0%), but increased for public-order
offenses (from 20.6% to 22.8%). During this period, the total
number of inmates increased in every category: violent offenders
increased from 68,600 to 89,000; property offenders from 86,300
to 118,700; and public-order offenders from 46,100 to 90,200. </p>

<p> Although offense information for more recent years is not
available, estimates may be made using 1989 percentages. Assuming
no change in the percentage distributions, the estimated number
of drug offenders in local jails in 1993 was more than 105,800,
representing a 5-fold increase since 1983. </p>

<p> More jail inmates held for State/Federal authorities </p>

<p> The Nation's jail population also grew between 1983 and 1993
as a result of crowding in State and Federal prisons. On June 30,
1993, nearly 12% of all jail inmates were prisoners being held
for State or Federal authorities. An estimated 53,900 inmates
were held for State or Federal authorities in 1993, up from
17,281 in 1983. </p>

<p> Between 1983 and 1993 the number of inmates held for State
and Federal authorities grew at twice the rate of the inmate
population overall (212% compared with 106%). </p>

<p> Approximately 34,200 jail inmates in 1993 were in local
facilities as a direct result of crowding of State or Federal
facilities (representing 7.4% of all jail inmates). The other
19,700 inmates held for State or Federal authorities were in jail
for other reasons, such as waiting transfer or early release
(pending completion of paperwork or transportation),
participation in special programs, and special security needs. </p>

<p> Methodology </p>

<p> Census of Jails </p>

<p> The 1993 Census of Jails was the sixth in a series of data
collection efforts aimed at studying the Nation's locally
administered jails. Previous censuses were conducted in 1970,
1972, 1978, 1983, and 1988. As in previous censuses, the U.S.
Bureau of the Census collected the data for the Bureau of Justice
Statistics. </p>

<p> The 1993 census included all locally administered confinement
facilities (3,287) that hold inmates beyond arraignment and are
staffed by municipal or county employees. The census also
included 17 jails that were privately operated under contract for
local governments and 7 facilities maintained by BOP and
functioning as jails. </p>

<p> Excluded from the census were temporary holding facilities,
such as drunk tanks and police lockups, that do not hold persons
after being formally charged in court (usually within 72 hours of
arrest). Also excluded were State-operated facilities in Alaska,
Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Rhode Island, and Vermont, which
have combined jail-prison systems. Five locally operated jails in
Alaska were included. </p>

<p> The mailing list used for the census was derived from the
National Justice Agency List, which is maintained by the Bureau
of the Census for BJS. The census forms were mailed to 3,506
facilities on June 22, 1993. </p>

<p> Twenty-eight jails were added to the initial mail out, and
230 were deleted, resulting in a total of 3,304 facilities. </p>

<p> After extensive follow-up, including additional mail requests
and repeated telephone contacts, all jails (except those in one
jurisdiction) provided data for four critical data items--number
of inmates, average daily population, rated capacity, and sex of
inmates housed. Data on the these four items for the
nonresponding jails were imputed based on data reported in the
1994 Annual Survey of Jails. </p>

<p> Completed forms with data for all or most items were received
for 2,981 jails, resulting in a 90% response rate. These
reporting jails housed 93% of all local jail inmates on June 30,
1993. </p>

<p> Estimation procedures </p>

<p> Because there was nonresponse and incomplete data on all
census items except the four critical items, national totals had
to be estimated. The following procedures were used to estimate
totals when data were incomplete: </p>

<p> 1. Each item was first assessed for coverage and internal
consistency. For purposes of estimating the totals, extreme
values were examined and then verified by checking other census
information or calling the respondents. Detailed categories were
also checked to determine if they summed to the reported totals. </p>

<p> 2. To provide a national total, item values were summed and
then multiplied by a nonresponse adjustment factor (NAF). For
most estimates, the NAF was a ratio of the total number of
inmates in all jails to the number of inmates in jails that
reported valid data. Ratios based on inmate counts were used to
estimate the number of adults, the number of inmates by sex and
age, conviction status by sex, the number of staff by
occupational category and region (tables 11 and 13), and payroll
staff by sex and race. Ratios based on the total average daily
population were used to estimate total expenditures. </p>

<ol>
    <li>Estimates of detailed categories were further adjusted so
        that for each item the sum of the detail equaled the
        estimated total. For example, the estimated numbers of
        male and female adult inmates were ratio adjusted so that
        the final estimates summed to the total number of adult
        inmates. </li>
    <li>All estimates of inmates and staff were rounded to the
        nearest 100. Expenditures were rounded to the nearest
        million dollars. </li>
</ol>

<p> 5. All rates, ratios, and percentage distributions in this
report are based on reported data only. </p>

<p> Annual Survey of Jails </p>

<p> In each of the 4 years between the full censuses, a survey of
jails is conducted to estimate baseline characteristics of the
Nation's jails and inmates housed in these jails. The 1994 Annual
Survey of Jails is the 10th such survey in a series begun in
1982. The reference date for the 1994 survey was June 30, 1994. </p>

<p> Using information from the 1993 Census of Jails, a new sample
of jail jurisdictions was selected for the 1994 survey. A
jurisdiction is a county (parish in Louisiana) or municipal
government that administers one or more local jails. The sample
included all jails in 796 selected jail jurisdictions and 23
multijurisdiction jails. A multi-jurisdiction jail is one in
which two or more jurisdictions have a formal agreement to
operate the facility. </p>

<p> In drawing the sample for 1994, jail jurisdictions were first
stratified into two groups: single jurisdiction jails and
multijurisdiction jails. All of the multi-jurisdiction jails were
included in the survey. The remaining jurisdictions were then
further stratified into two groups: jurisdictions with jails
authorized to hold juveniles and jurisdictions with jails holding
only adults. Jurisdictions were then selected based on the
average daily population in the 1993 census. All jails in 203
jurisdictions were automatically included if the jurisdiction
held juveniles and had an average daily population of 250 or more
inmates in 1993 or if they held only adults and had an average
population of 500 or more. The other jurisdictions (593) were
then selected based on stratified probability sampling. </p>

<p> Data were obtained by mailed questionnaires. After follow-up
phone calls to nonrespondents, the response rate for the survey
was 100%. </p>

<p> National estimates for the inmate population on June 30,
1994, were produced by sex, race/Hispanic origin, and age group
and for the average daily population during the year ending June
30, 1994. National estimates were also produced for rated
capacity. </p>

<p> Sampling error </p>

<p> Survey estimates have an associated sampling error because
jurisdictions with smaller average daily populations were sampled
for the survey. Estimates based on the sample survey may differ
somewhat from the results of conducting a complete census.
Different samples could yield somewhat different results.
Standard error is a measure of the variation among the estimates
from all possible samples, stating the precision with which an
estimate from a particular sample approximates the average of all
possible samples. The estimated relative sampling error for the
total inmate population of 490,442 on June 30, 1994, was 0.50%.
(See appendix tables 1 and 2.) </p>

<p> Results presented in this Bulletin were tested to determine
whether differences between 1993 census counts and 1994 survey
estimates were statistically significant. All differences
mentioned in the report meet or exceed the 95-percent confidence
level. </p>

<p> Measures of population </p>

<p> Two measures of inmate population are used: the average daily
population for the year ending June 30 and the inmate count on
June 30 of each year. The average daily population balances out
any extraordinary events that may render atypical the inmate
count on June 30. The June 30 count provides data on
characteristics of inmates, such as race, Hispanic origin, and
age, that may not be available on an annual basis. </p>

<p> Juveniles </p>

<p> State statutes and judicial practices allow juveniles to be
incarcerated in adult jails under a variety of circumstances.
Because of the differing statutes and practices, however,
accurate and comparable data on juveniles are difficult to
collect. The 1994 Annual Survey of Jails provides new and more
accurate estimates of the juvenile population. For the first
time, the survey provides estimates of the total number of jail
inmates under age 18, the number held as adults, and the number
held as juveniles. New sampling procedures were also introduced
in 1994 to minimize the standard errors of these estimates. By
stratifying jurisdictions based on the authority to house
juveniles, the precision of the juvenile counts were improved. </p>

<p> This study examines how State and Federal correctional
facilities seek to </p>

<p> stop the entry and use of illegal drugs. Based on the 1990
Census of State </p>

<p> and Federal Correctional Facilities, the report indicates
that nearly 9 in </p>

<p> 10 institutions conduct urine surveillance among the inmate
population, </p>

<p> usually on a random basis or on suspicion of use. Marijuana
and cocaine </p>

<p> were the drugs most commonly detected--in Federal facilities
about 1 in 100 </p>

<p> of the tests for marijuana and 1 in 250 tests for cocaine
were positive </p>

<p> while in State facilities about 1 in 16 tests were positive
for marijuana </p>

<p> and 1 in 28 were positive for cocaine. </p>

<p> I want to express my deep appreciation to the employees in
the 957 State </p>

<p> prisons, 80 Federal prisons, and the 250 community-based
facilities who </p>

<p> participated in the census. The 100-percent response rate is,
I believe, </p>

<p> important testimony to the utility and significance of
national data on the </p>

<p> operations of our Nation's correctional facilities. </p>

<p> By Caroline Wolf Harlow, Ph.D. </p>

<p> BJS Statistician </p>

<p> About 7 of every 8 prisons in the Nation tested an estimated
total of </p>

<p> 565,500 inmates for one or more illegal drugs between July 1,
1989, and </p>

<p> June 30, 1990. In State facilities, 3.6% of the tests for
cocaine, 1.3% </p>

<p> for heroin, 2.0% for methamphetamines, and 6.3% for marijuana
found </p>

<p> evidence of drug use. In Federal prisons, 0.4% of the tests
for cocaine, </p>

<p> 0.4% for heroin, 0.1% for methamphetamines, and 1.1% for
marijuana were </p>

<p> positive. </p>

<p> This report uses information provided to the Census of State
and Federal </p>

<p> Adult Correctional Facilities. Data were collected from 957
State prison </p>

<p> facilities, 250 State community-based facilities, and 80
Federal prisons </p>

<p> operating on June 29, 1990. Censuses were also conducted in
1984, 1979, </p>

<p> and 1974, but the 1990 census was the first to gather
information on drug </p>

<p> interdiction practices, drug testing of inmates and staff,
and inmate drug </p>

<p> treatment programs. </p>

<p> Other findings from the 1990 census include the following: </p>

<p> *Ninety-eight percent of State community-based
facilities--those in which </p>

<p> at least half of the residents may leave the facility
daily--tested </p>

<p> residents. All Federal prisons and 83% of State prisons
reported that they </p>

<p> tested inmates for drug use. </p>

<p> *Seventy-six percent of institutions reported testing inmates
for drugs </p>

<p> when drug use was suspected. Twenty percent tested all
inmates at least </p>

<p> once during confinement. </p>

<p> *At State confinement facilities 1.4% of tests for cocaine,
1.0% for </p>

<p> heroin, 2.3% for methamphetamines, and 5.8% for marijuana
indicated drug </p>

<p> use. </p>

<p> *At State community-based facilities 8.9% of tests for
cocaine confirmed </p>

<p> the presence of the drug, as did 2.2% for heroin, 1.1% for </p>

<p> methamphetamines, and 8.1% for marijuana. </p>

<p> *State confinement facilities that only tested inmates
suspected of drug </p>

<p> use had higher positive rates than facilities that tested all
or random </p>

<p> groups of inmates (6% for cocaine and 14% for marijuana
versus 1.5% for </p>

<p> cocaine and 5% for marijuana). </p>

<p> *State and Federal facilities used a variety of methods to
prevent drugs </p>

<p> from being brought into the institution, including
ques-tioning, patdowns, </p>

<p> clothing exchanges, and body cavity searches. </p>

<p> *At admission inmates were required to exchange clothing in
88% of the </p>

<p> Federal prisons and 59% of State prisons; inmates were patted
down in 88% </p>

<p> of Federal prisons and 78% of the State prisons. </p>

<p> *In the facilities using the most intrusive interdiction
technique, body </p>

<p> cavity searches, positive drug test results among inmates
tested were lower </p>

<p> than in facilities using other methods of interdiction. </p>

<p> *Questioning and search of belongings were widely used for
visitors to both </p>

<p> Federal and State facilities. </p>

<p> *Federal confinement facilities reported that they could
provide drug </p>

<p> treatment for an estimated 7,800 inmates; State confinement
facilities, for </p>

<p> 114,000; and State community-based facilities, for 9,400. </p>

<p> *Federal facilities were using an estimated 62% of total drug
treatment </p>

<p> capacity on June 29, 1990; State confinement facilities, 78%;
and </p>

<p> community-based facilities, 66%. </p>

<p> Introduction </p>

<p> The Census of State and Federal Adult Correctional
Facilities, conducted </p>

<p> periodically by the Bureau of the Census on behalf of the
Bureau of Justice </p>

<p> Statistics (BJS), included a new series of questions in 1990.
(See </p>

<p> Methodology on page 12 for further information about the
census and the </p>

<p> questionnaire.) This addendum--designed with the assistance
of the </p>

<p> National Institute on Drug Abuse and the Office of National
Drug Control </p>

<p> Policy--asked how facilities interdict drugs and
paraphernalia among </p>

<p> inmates, visitors, and staff and who was chosen for each
method of </p>

<p> interdiction. </p>

<p> In addition, the addendum gathered information on drug
testing policies, </p>

<p> practices, and outcomes. The questionnaire asked facilities
to estimate </p>

<p> the number of inmates in need of drug treatment programs and
the capacity </p>

<p> of currently available programs. </p>

<p> Methods of drug interdiction </p>

<p> Different facilities have a variety of policies and practices
related to </p>

<p> interdiction of drugs from inmates, visitors, and staff. </p>

<p> Facilities may physically check persons entering the
facility. Inmates may </p>

<p> be checked for drugs or other contraband when they enter a
facility for the </p>

<p> first time or reenter after an absence. The checks may be
relatively </p>

<p> nonintrusive, such as verbal questioning or pat-downs, or
more intrusive, </p>

<p> such as body cavity searches and clothing exchanges or
searches of </p>

<p> belongings. These checks may be conducted among all entering
persons, </p>

<p> random groups, or only those suspected of carrying drugs.
Many prisons may </p>

<p> use all of the approaches at different times. </p>

<p> The figure below shows a general typology for the range of
methods for each </p>

<p> type of drug interdiction. A plus sign (+) indicates the use
of a method </p>

<p> and a minus sign (-) means no reported use. Type 1
facilities, for </p>

<p> example, reported using all three methods to choose persons
for an </p>

<p> interdiction activity. Type 4 facilities reported performing
an </p>

<p> interdiction activity on all persons but not choosing random
or suspected </p>

<p> subjects. </p>

<p> Interdiction All Random Suspected </p>

<p> Type 1 + + + </p>

<p> Type 2 + + - </p>

<p> Type 5 - + + </p>

<p> Type 6 - + - </p>

<p> Type 7 - - + </p>

<p> Type 8 - - - </p>

<p> Interdiction activities: </p>

<p> Most prison facilities patted down inmates and required them
to exchange </p>

<p> clothes upon admission or any reentry </p>

<p> Prison facilities perform many activities to prevent drugs
and other </p>

<p> contraband from entering. Correctional authorities commonly
question </p>

<p> inmates, pat them down, require changing into
prison-furnished clothes, and </p>

<p> search body cavities. Eighty-eight percent of Federal
facilities reported </p>

<p> that they patted down new admissions and required them to
replace their </p>

<p> clothes (table 1). Seventy-eight percent of State confinement
facilities </p>

<p> and 71% of community-based facilities patted down newly
admitted inmates. </p>

<p> (Community-based facilities are those in which half or more
of the </p>

<p> residents are permitted to leave unaccompanied by staff for
work or study. </p>

<p> Because inmates regularly leave community-based facilities,
drug-related </p>

<p> problems in these facilities are different from those in
secured </p>

<p> facilities.) </p>

<p> Fifty-nine percent of State confinement facilities and 26% of
community- </p>

<p> based facilities required them to substitute prison clothes.
At least </p>

<p> three-quarters of both State and Federal facilities
questioned new </p>

<p> admissions about drugs. </p>

<p> When looking for the presence of hidden drugs, facilities
were less likely </p>

<p> to perform body cavity searches than take other interdiction
measures. </p>

<p> Sixty-one percent of Federal facilities, 45% of State
confinement </p>

<p> facilities, and 14% of State community-based facilities
reported that they </p>

<p> conducted body cavity searches among inmates at admission. </p>

<p> Institutions could apply an interdiction activity to all
inmates, to groups </p>

<p> of inmates selected at random, or to suspected drug users or
couriers. </p>

<p> Patting down new and returning inmates and requiring them to
exchange </p>

<p> clothes generally applied to all inmates (table 2). Over 80%
of Federal </p>

<p> facilities patted down all inmates and required an exchange
of clothing. </p>

<p> Almost 78% of State confinement facilities frisked all
inmates, and 57% </p>

<p> substituted prison clothes. </p>

<p> In 46% of Federal facilities and in 20% of State facilities,
body cavity </p>

<p> searches were conducted among all entering inmates. About 39%
of State </p>

<p> confinement facilities reported that a body cavity search
would be </p>

<p> conducted when the staff suspected inmates of carrying drugs.
</p>

<p> Most facilities searched the belongings </p>

<p> of visitors </p>

<p> Staff checked visitors' belongings for drugs in 93% of
Federal </p>

<p> institutions, 87% of State confinement facilities, and 76% of
the </p>

<p> community-based (table 3). Visitors were patted down for
drugs in 51% of </p>

<p> Federal prisons, 69% of State confinement institutions, and
40% of </p>

<p> community-based facilities. </p>

<p> All visitors were generally subjected to searches of their
belongings </p>

<p> (table 4). About 83% of Federal facilities and 57% of State
facilities </p>

<p> looked through the personal possessions of all visitors.
Frisking visitors </p>

<p> for drugs and checking body cavities occurred primarily if
visitors were </p>

<p> suspected of carrying drugs or paraphernalia. Five in ten of
Federal </p>

<p> prisons and 4 in 10 of State facilities patted down visitors
on suspicion. </p>

<p> About 28% of Federal Facilities and 18% of State facilities
searched body </p>

<p> cavities of visitors if the visitors were suspected of
smuggling drugs. </p>

<p> Staff were also subject to drug interdiction activities: </p>

<p> When reporting to work, staff were patted down in about half
of State </p>

<p> confinement facilities and in more than a fifth of Federal
confinement and </p>

<p> State community-based facilities (table 5). In over 50% of
Federal </p>

<p> facilities and 40% of State facilities staff were questioned.
Most </p>

<p> interdiction activities involving staff were conducted on
suspicion of </p>

<p> smuggling drugs. About 45% of Federal facilities and 23% of
State </p>

<p> facilities interrogated staff if they were suspected of drug
involvement </p>

<p> (table 6). About 19% of Federal facilities also patted down
staff on </p>

<p> suspicion, compared to 14% of State facilities. About 23% of
State </p>

<p> facilities frisked staff members at random. </p>

<p> Maximum security facilities took more stringent drug
interdiction measures </p>

<p> than other facilities </p>

<p> Staff in Federal maximum security prisons were more likely
than those in </p>

<p> medium or minimum security facilities to search body cavities
and to </p>

<p> require all inmates to exchange clothing (table 7). All
Federal maximum </p>

<p> security institutions required all inmates to put on new
prison-issued </p>

<p> clothes upon entry or reentry. Nearly 55% of Federal maximum
security </p>

<p> facilities, compared to 38% of minimum security prisons,
conducted body </p>

<p> cavity searches of all newly admitted or returning inmates. </p>

<p> In maximum security prisons staff were less likely than in
other Federal </p>

<p> facilities to question all of the inmates or to pat them
down. All inmates </p>

<p> were interrogated in 64% of maximum security prisons and
frisked in 73%, </p>

<p> while all inmates were questioned in 94% of minimum security
facilities and </p>

<p> patted down in 81%. </p>

<p> The staff in State maximum and medium security prisons were
more likely </p>

<p> than those in minimum security facilities to make all
entering or returning </p>

<p> inmates exchange clothes (over 60% of maximum or medium
security prisons, </p>

<p> compared to 47% of minimum security prisons). In nearly 1 in
5 maximum </p>

<p> security State prisons, staff searched the body cavities of
all new or </p>

<p> returning prisoners. Staff performed body cavity searches on
suspected </p>

<p> inmates in over half of State maximum security facilities. </p>

<p> State community-based facilities were less likely than State
confinement </p>

<p> facilities to search residents to interdict drugs. Staff in
about 59% of </p>

<p> State community-based facilities patted down all inmates. In
22% of </p>

<p> community-based facilities, the staff required all inmates to
change to </p>

<p> facility clothing, and in 15%, searched body cavities of
residents </p>

<p> suspected of having drugs. </p>

<p> Interpreting measures of drug testing </p>

<p> Prevalence of drug use in prisons is difficult to estimate.
Part of the </p>

<p> difficulty occurs with record keeping and reporting. A drug
test </p>

<p> determines the presence of a specific drug at a specific
level. A single </p>

<p> urine sample can be used for a single drug test or for
multiple tests for </p>

<p> different drugs. Correctional authorities were asked to
report the number </p>

<p> of tests for each drug and the number of positive tests.
However, some </p>

<p> authorities may have reported the number of urine samples
taken if their </p>

<p> records included only those figures. </p>

<p> Other difficulties in estimating the amount of drug use in
prison include </p>

<p> the following: </p>

<p> *Prisons differ in the selection of whom to test. Most
facilities do not </p>

<p> choose inmates for testing using a sample with a known
probability of </p>

<p> selection: One cannot say that the selected inmates represent
all inmates </p>

<p> in the institution. </p>

<p> * Prisons differ in what drugs they test for. Prison
authorities may not </p>

<p> suspect the use of a drug and not test for it, even though
the drug is used </p>

<p> in their facility. Other prisons may conduct repeated tests
for a drug </p>

<p> seldom used. </p>

<p> * A single urine specimen can have more than one positive
drug test from an </p>

<p> individual using multiple drugs. Describing positive rates by
type of drug </p>

<p> will overstate the number of inmates with at least one
positive test. </p>

<p> *Prisons differ in how often they test inmates. Drug testing
may be rare </p>

<p> in some prisons and frequent in others. </p>

<p> *Urine tests only detect the presence of most drugs 48 to 72
hours after </p>

<p> use, except for PCP and marijuana, which may be detected up
to 30 days </p>

<p> after use. </p>

<p> This varying span, when combined with lack of random
sampling, distorts any </p>

<p> estimation of overall drug use. </p>

<p> * Depending on various factors, the presence of
methamphetamines may not be </p>

<p> distinguished from amphetamines; therefore, the test results
for these two </p>

<p> drugs should be considered together. </p>

<p> *Prisons may differ in the types of tests used. Some types
are more </p>

<p> accurate than others, producing lower numbers of false
positives and false </p>

<p> negatives. Facilities may or may not perform confirmatory
tests, and they </p>

<p> were not asked to estimate the number of false positives and
false </p>

<p> negatives. </p>

<p> For the above reasons, drug test results in this report are
not a measure </p>

<p> of the extent of the problem in the various kinds of
facilities. Positive </p>

<p> results should be interpreted only as indicating the
percentage positive </p>

<p> for the specific tests given. </p>

<p> Testing urine for drug use </p>

<p> Most correctional facilities tested some inmates for illegal
drug use </p>

<p> About 87% of all correctional facilities tested inmates for
illegal drug </p>

<p> use (table 8). All Federal prisons, 83% of State confinement
facilities, </p>

<p> and 98% of State community-based facilities reported testing
inmates </p>

<p> between July 1, 1989, and June 30, 1990. </p>

<p> Authorities in facilities which reported data (85% of all
facilities) </p>

<p> indicated that they collected 598,000 urine specimens from
468,500 inmates. </p>

<p> When these figures are projected to all facilities, including
those which </p>

<p> did not respond to these questions, an estimated 565,500
inmates provided </p>

<p> 721,800 specimens from July 1, 1989, through June 30, 1990.
(See </p>

<p> &quot;Estimation procedure&quot; in Methodology.) </p>

<p> State minimum and medium security and community-based
facilities were more </p>

<p> likely than maximum security institutions to test inmates.
About 85% of </p>

<p> the lower security facilities and 98% of community-based
facilities tested </p>

<p> inmates, compared to 76% of the maximum security prisons. </p>

<p> Most State facilities testing inmates for drugs performed the
tests when </p>

<p> the staff suspected particular inmates of drug use; 76% of
the institutions </p>

<p> reported checking inmates based on suspicion of use.
Forty-two percent </p>

<p> tested both suspected inmates and random groups, and an
additional 14% </p>

<p> tested all inmates (type 1). Relatively few facilities (20%)
tested all </p>

<p> inmates at least once during confinement (types 1-4). </p>

<p> Most large State confinement facilities tested for drugs </p>

<p> About 92% of State prisons with a population of 2,500 or more
tested </p>

<p> inmates, compared to around 83% of facilities with fewer than
1,000 inmates </p>

<p> and 77% of facilities with a population between 1,000 and
2,499 (table 9). </p>

<p> Over half of the largest facilities tested inmates on
suspicion only. Over </p>

<p> half of facilities with a population between 250 and 2,499
tested all </p>

<p> inmates or random groups of inmates in addition to inmates
suspected of </p>

<p> drug use. About 70% of community-based facilities tested
either all </p>

<p> inmates or random groups and inmates suspected of using
drugs. </p>

<p> Almost all work release facilities tested </p>

<p> for drugs </p>

<p> About 92% of facilities that provided special work release or
prerelease </p>

<p> programs tested inmates for drugs (table 10). Ninety-three
percent of </p>

<p> facilities that separately handled offenders reincarcerated
for violating </p>

<p> some condition of their supervised release also checked
inmates for drugs. </p>

<p> Over 90% of facilities that performed &quot;other&quot;
functions, such as </p>

<p> presentence, psychiatric, or geriatric services also tested
their </p>

<p> residents. Nearly 60% of facilities for youthful offenders
tested inmates. </p>

<p> For all inmates tested, State prisons reported higher
positive rates than </p>

<p> Federal prisons </p>

<p> Nationwide, 3.1% of the tests for cocaine in the 12 months
before June 30, </p>

<p> 1990, were positive, as were 1.2% of the tests for heroin,
1.5% for </p>

<p> methamphetamines, and 5.6% for marijuana. State facilities
reported higher </p>

<p> positive rates for drug tests than Federal facilities (table
11). In State </p>

<p> institutions, 3.6% of tests for cocaine were positive,
compared to 0.4% in </p>

<p> Federal prisons. State facilities found 2.0% of the tests
showing recent </p>

<p> methamphetamine use and 6.3% showing marijuana use; Federal
prisons found </p>

<p> 0.1% and 1.1%, respectively. </p>

<p> I </p>

<p> Same percentage of State and Federal facilities reported
positive drug </p>

<p> tests </p>

<p> When facilities rather than individual drug tests are
considered, Federal </p>

<p> and State facilities were about equally likely to have found
drug use in </p>

<p> their institutions. Around 6 in 10 of both Federal and State
facilities </p>

<p> which tested for cocaine had at least one positive test. In
over 2 in 10 </p>

<p> facilities testing for methamphetamines, the use of the drug
was </p>

<p> discovered. Marijuana was detected in about 8 in 10
facilities testing. </p>

<p> Community-based facilities found higher rates of drug use
than confinement </p>

<p> facilities </p>

<p> Tests had positive outcomes for 8.9% of the cocaine tests and
8.1% of the </p>

<p> marijuana tests administered by community-based facilities,
compared to </p>

<p> 1.4% of the cocaine tests and 5.8% of marijuana tests in
confinement </p>

<p> facilities (table 12). Methamphetamines, however, were found
more often in </p>

<p> confinement facilities (2.3% tested positive) than in
community-based </p>

<p> facilities (1.1% positive). </p>

<p> Among State confinement facilities, positive test results
were highest in </p>

<p> those testing on suspicion only. </p>

<p> How inmates were selected for testing affected the rate of
positive </p>

<p> results. Those State confinement facilities testing only when
drug use was </p>

<p> suspected recorded higher rates of positive results than
other facilities </p>

<p> that tested randomly or comprehensively. When facilities
tested only on </p>

<p> suspicion of drug use, 6% of cocaine tests and 14% of
marijuana tests were </p>

<p> positive, compared to 1.5% or less for cocaine and 5% or less
for marijuana </p>

<p> when facilities tested everyone or at random. </p>

<p> The results for State community-based facilities were
opposite those of </p>

<p> confinement facilities. Testing on suspicion only produced a
lower </p>

<p> percentage of positive results than testing everyone or a
random selection. </p>

<p> In community-based facilities which tested on suspicion only,
4.8% were </p>

<p> positive for cocaine and 6.4% for marijuana; in
community-based facilities </p>

<p> using other selection methods, around 9% of tests for cocaine
and 8% for </p>

<p> marijuana were positive. </p>

<p> The percentages of positive tests were higher in large
facilities </p>

<p> Large prisons, whether Federal or State, had higher rates of
positive drug </p>

<p> tests. In Federal facilities with 1,000 or more inmates, 1.4%
of the </p>

<p> marijuana tests, 0.6% of the cocaine, and 0.6% of the heroin
tests were </p>

<p> positive (table 13). In Federal facilities holding fewer than
500 inmates, </p>

<p> the percentages were 0.5% for marijuana, 0.2% for cocaine,
and none for </p>

<p> heroin. Among State prisons, the largest facilities with
2,500 or more </p>

<p> inmates had the highest percentages of positive tests for
amphetamines, </p>

<p> cocaine, and heroin. </p>

<p> The facilities holding 1,000 to 2,499 inmates had the highest
rates for </p>

<p> marijuana and methamphetamines. Among Federal prisons, the
maximum </p>

<p> security facilities had higher rates for positive drug tests
than minimum </p>

<p> security facilities. In maximum security prisons, 2.5% of the
tests for </p>

<p> marijuana, .7% of the tests for cocaine, and 1.4% of the
tests for heroin </p>

<p> were positive. In minimum security, 0.3% for marijuana, 0.3%
for cocaine, </p>

<p> and none for heroin were positive. </p>

<p> State medium security facilities generally had higher
positive rates than </p>

<p> maximum or minimum security prisons. For each drug in medium
security </p>

<p> facilities, the percentage positive was as follows: 6.8% for
marijuana, </p>

<p> 4.2% for methamphetamines, 1.7% for cocaine, and 1.4% for
heroin. In </p>

<p> maximum and minimum facilities, the equivalent findings were
5.0% or less </p>

<p> for marijuana, 0.6% or less for methamphetamines, 1.4% or
less for cocaine, </p>

<p> and 0.8% or less for heroin. </p>

<p> Positive results from drug tests varied among facilities
performing </p>

<p> different functions </p>

<p> Facilities which confined inmates returned to custody for
parole violations </p>

<p> had relatively high percentages of positive drug tests (table
14). More </p>

<p> than 9% of tests for marijuana were positive, as were 6.2% of
tests for </p>

<p> methamphetamines, 3.5% for cocaine, and 2.9% for heroin.
Facilities </p>

<p> holding inmates who participated in work release programs or
who were </p>

<p> preparing for discharge also had relatively high positive
test rates: 7% </p>

<p> for cocaine, 6.9% for marijuana, and 1.8% for heroin. Drug/
alcohol </p>

<p> treatment in facilities was associated with relatively high
positive </p>

<p> results on tests for cocaine and marijuana use--3% for
cocaine and 7.6% for </p>

<p> marijuana. </p>

<p> Facilities handling youthful offenders generally had
relatively low </p>

<p> positive test results: 2.1% for marijuana and 1.5% for
cocaine. </p>

<p> Positive drug tests were linked to interdiction activities </p>

<p> The State confinement facilities that questioned and frisked
inmates but </p>

<p> did not exchange clothes or search body cavities had higher
rates of </p>

<p> positive drug tests than facilities doing all these measures
(table 15). </p>

<p> The tests in the facilities using less stringent measures
were 5.2% </p>

<p> positive for cocaine, 13.5% for marijuana, and 16.2% for
methamphetamines. </p>

<p> Tests in facilities performing all types of specific drug
interdiction </p>

<p> activities were 1.2% positive for cocaine, 4.6% for
marijuana, and 0.6% for </p>

<p> methamphetamines. Facilities which performed all types of
interdiction </p>

<p> activities had higher positive drug test rates than
facilities which did </p>

<p> body cavity searches and/or clothing exchanges. The
facilities doing all </p>

<p> types of interdiction may have adopted more measures as a
reaction to </p>

<p> relatively high test rates. The reported rates were from
results over the </p>

<p> 12 months before the census, while the interdiction measures
were those in </p>

<p> place on June 29, 1990. </p>

<p> Facilities that did not question, frisk, or search visitors
had the </p>

<p> following positive test results: 8.3% for marijuana and 7.4%
for cocaine. </p>

<p> Facilities that inspected visitors' belongings and searched
body cavities </p>

<p> when indicated, but did not both question and pat down
visitors, had the </p>

<p> following positive test percentages: 2.9% for heroin, 2.6%
for cocaine, and </p>

<p> 12% for methamphetamines. </p>

<p> Facilities that reported not making special efforts to
interdict the supply </p>

<p> of drugs from the staff had 2.6% positive tests for cocaine,
2.2% for </p>

<p> heroin, and 6.6% for methamphetamines. Facilities that
questioned staff, </p>

<p> patted them down, and took other actions such as drug
testing, when needed </p>

<p> had 1.0% positive tests for cocaine and 0.9% for heroin and </p>

<p> methamphetamines. </p>

<p> Drug testing of staff was highest </p>

<p> in Federal facilities </p>

<p> While 83% of Federal facilities reported they tested their
staff for drugs, </p>

<p> 42% of State confinement facilities and 32% of
community-based facilities </p>

<p> checked their employees (table 16). About 55% of Federal
confinement </p>

<p> facilities tested all staff, as did 30% of State confinement
facilities and </p>

<p> 19% of community-based facilities. </p>

<p> Seventy-six percent of Federal facilities and about 23% of
State facilities </p>

<p> tested employees, the primary staff category tested. </p>

<p> A higher percentage of Federal than State facility staff were
tested for </p>

<p> drugs. Fifteen percent of Federal facility staff were tested
compared to </p>

<p> 4% of those working in State confinement facilities and 10%
in community- </p>

<p> based facilities. </p>

<p> A positive test was grounds for dismissal </p>

<p> in over a third of facilities that tested staff </p>

<p> for drugs </p>

<p> In over a third of facilities, policies required that staff
testing </p>

<p> positive for drugs be dismissed. In over a seventh, affected
staff were </p>

<p> suspended (table 17). Sixty percent of State confinement
facilities and </p>

<p> 44% of community-based facilities referred positive drug
detection cases to </p>

<p> internal affairs. Fifty-nine percent of Federal facilities
referred the </p>

<p> case to a departmentally operated program -- generally an
employee </p>

<p> assistance counselor who could refer the employee for outside
treatment. </p>

<p> Federal facilities were more likely than State facilities to
keep their </p>

<p> staff and continue to check them for drugs or to reassign
them. Twenty- </p>

<p> four percent of Federal facilities continued monitoring staff
with drug </p>

<p> tests, compared to 10% of State confinement facilities and
12%of community- </p>

<p> based facilities. </p>

<p> Inmate/resident drug treatment programs and capacities </p>

<p> Facilities provided estimates of the number of
inmates/residents who could </p>

<p> be treated in each of their drug treatment and intervention
programs and </p>

<p> estimates of the enrollment in each program. Facilities also
estimated </p>

<p> their total capacity for drug treatment and their total
enrollment. These </p>

<p> totals were generally lower than the sum of all the
separately listed </p>

<p> programs and interventions, possibly for the following
reasons: </p>

<p> *some programs listed were not considered true drug
&quot;treatment&quot; programs; </p>

<p> *an individual program might have several of the components
listed on the </p>

<p> addendum--for example, counseling, education, and urine
surveillance--and </p>

<p> hence be counted several times in the specific listings; </p>

<p> *inmates could be participating in more than one program; </p>

<p> *facilities could have some treatment slots which could be
allocated to </p>

<p> more than one program and therefore were counted more than
once. </p>

<p> Drug treatment/intervention on June 29, 1990 </p>

<p> Among the 1,287 State and Federal facilities, 1,024 reported
their own </p>

<p> estimates of total capacity and enrollment in programs they
considered to </p>

<p> be for drug treatment. Facility capacities and enrollments
for drug </p>

<p> treatment were-- </p>

<p> Among those Federal facilities that reported, administrators
indicated that </p>

<p> on a single day the facilities could treat about 6,100
inmates and had an </p>

<p> enrollment of about 3,800. For reporting State facilities,
both </p>

<p> confinement and community-based, the estimated capacity was
90,900 and </p>

<p> enrollment was 69,900. </p>

<p> Prisons could treat an estimated </p>

<p> 131,900 inmates for drug addiction </p>

<p> If the reported capacity is projected to all prisons, Federal
confinement </p>

<p> facilities could treat an estimated 7,800 inmates; State
confinement </p>

<p> facilities, 114,000; and State community-based facilities,
9,400. (See </p>

<p> &quot;Estimation procedure&quot; in Methodology.) </p>

<p> (Treatment capacity and enrollment were estimated from the
77.7% of Federal </p>

<p> inmates in reporting facilities, 72.9% of State inmates in
reporting </p>

<p> confinement facilities, and 83.3% of State inmates in
reporting community- </p>

<p> based facilities.) </p>

<p> Federal confinement facilities had the capacity to treat for
drug abuse 14% </p>

<p> of the inmate population; State confinement facilities, 18%;
and community- </p>

<p> based facilities, 55%. </p>

<p> Prisons were treating approximately 100,200 inmates </p>

<p> If the reported enrollment figures are projected to cover all
facilities, </p>

<p> the Federal prison system was treating an estimated 4,800
inmates; the </p>

<p> State prisons, an estimated 88,700; and community-based
facilities, an </p>

<p> estimated 6,200. (See &quot;Estimation procedure&quot; in
Methodology.) </p>

<p> (Treatment capacity and enrollment were estimated from the
77.7% of Federal </p>

<p> inmates in reporting facilities, 72.9% of State inmates in
reporting </p>

<p> confinement facilities, and 83.3% of State inmates in
reporting community- </p>

<p> based facilities.) </p>

<p> Enrollment in drug treatment was below capacity) </p>

<p> Federal inmates were using 62% of the drug treatment capacity
on June 29, </p>

<p> 1990. State prisoners were using 66% of the capacity in
community-based </p>

<p> facilities and 78% in confinement facilities. </p>

<p> Many factors play a role in these utilization figures.
Inmates may refuse </p>

<p> to participate or may have already completed the program.
Inmates may not </p>

<p> qualify--too new to the institution, not near enough to the
end of their </p>

<p> sentence, rule breakers, under administrative segregation, or
in the wrong </p>

<p> custody level. Facilities also may keep some slots open to
gain </p>

<p> flexibility to deal with unexpected situations. </p>

<p> Prisons offered a variety of programs </p>

<p> Prisons may offer many types of drug intervention or
treatment: </p>

<p> detoxification, counseling, education and/or awareness
programs, urine </p>

<p> surveillance, and treatment in special residential units
within the </p>

<p> facility. Federal facilities reported they could test 33% of
inmates for </p>

<p> drugs; State confinement facilities, 10%; and community-based
facilities, </p>

<p> 57% (table 18). Counseling was available for 14% of inmates
in Federal </p>

<p> facilities, 12% in State confinement facilities, and 48% in
community-based </p>

<p> facilities. Residential treatment program capacity was from
1% to 2% of </p>

<p> inmate population for all types </p>

<p> of institutions. </p>

<p> Of all Federal inmates, 9% were enrolled in some form of drug
treatment on </p>

<p> June 29, 1990. Among State prisoners, 14% in confinement
facilities and </p>

<p> 37% in community-based facilities were enrolled. The two most
common types </p>

<p> of programs for both Federal and State correctional
facilities were </p>

<p> education and counseling. </p>

<p> Drug education programs enrolled 13% of Federal prisoners, 7%
of State </p>

<p> confinement inmates, and 25% of residents in community-based
facilities. </p>

<p> Six percent of those in Federal facilities were being
counseled, as were 9% </p>

<p> of State confinement facility inmates and 32% of those in
community-based </p>

<p> facilities. </p>

<p> Methodology </p>

<p> The 1990 Census of State and Federal Adult Correctional
Facilities was the </p>

<p> fourth enumeration of State institutions and the first of
Federal </p>

<p> institutions sponsored by the Bureau of Justice Statistics
and conducted by </p>

<p> the Bureau of the Census. Earlier censuses were completed in
1974, 1979, </p>

<p> and 1984. </p>

<p> Census universe </p>

<p> The facility universe was developed from the Census of State
Adult </p>

<p> Correctional Facilities conducted in 1984. This list was
revised using the </p>

<p> 1990 American Correctional Association Directory and
information obtained </p>

<p> from State correctional administrators and the Federal Bureau
of Prisons. </p>

<p> The census included: prisons; prison farms; reception,
diagnostic and </p>

<p> classification centers; road camps; forestry and conservation
camps; </p>

<p> youthful offender facilities (except in California);
vocational training </p>

<p> facilities; correctional drug and alcohol treatment
facilities; and State- </p>

<p> operated local detention facilities in Alaska, Connecticut,
Delaware, </p>

<p> Hawaii, Rhode Island, and Vermont. </p>

<p> Facilities were included in the census if they: </p>

<p> *were staffed with State or Federal employees </p>

<p> *housed primarily State or Federal prisoners </p>

<p> *were physically, functionally, and administratively separate
from other </p>

<p> facilities </p>

<p> *were operational on the reference date, June 29, 1990. </p>

<p> The census also included, for the first time, 67 private
facilities that </p>

<p> were under exclusive contract by State governments to house
prisoners. </p>

<p> Specifically excluded were-- </p>

<p> *privately operated facilities that were not exclusively for
State or </p>

<p> Federal inmates </p>

<p> *military facilities </p>

<p> *Immigration and Naturalization Service facilities </p>

<p> *facilities operated and administered by local governments,
including those </p>

<p> housing State prisoners </p>

<p> *facilities operated by the U.S. Marshals Service </p>

<p> *hospital wings and wards reserved </p>

<p> for State prisoners. </p>

<p> Questionnaire administration </p>

<p> Questionnaires were mailed to facility respondents at the end
of June 1990. </p>

<p> Second and third request forms and telephone followups went
out in the </p>

<p> fall, resulting in a final response rate of 100%. </p>

<p> Definitions of community-based and confinement facilities </p>

<p> Correctional facilities were classified as community-based if
50% or more </p>

<p> of the residents were regularly permitted to leave the
facility </p>

<p> unaccompanied for work or study. These facilities included
halfway houses, </p>

<p> restitution centers, and pre-release, work release, and study
release </p>

<p> centers. Correctional facilities in which less than 50% of
the inmates </p>

<p> regularly left the facility unaccompanied were classified as
confinement </p>

<p> institutions. </p>

<p> Drug addendum </p>

<p> An addendum on drug control activities in State and Federal
facilities was </p>

<p> included for the first time in the 1990 census. Facilities
were asked to </p>

<p> provide information on the following: </p>

<p> *activities they used with inmates, visitors, and staff to
keep out illegal </p>

<p> drugs and drug paraphernalia </p>

<p> *inmate drug testing practices, including the criteria for
testing inmates, </p>

<p> the number of inmates tested in total and by specific drug,
and the number </p>

<p> positive </p>

<p> *staff drug testing, including groups and basis for testing,
number tested, </p>

<p> and procedures when tests were positive </p>

<p> *capacity and enrollment in various types of drug treatment
and </p>

<p> intervention programs. </p>

<p> Estimation procedures </p>

<p> When all prisons in the census did not provide data on
particular </p>

<p> variables, estimated figures were used where indicated. Total
figures were </p>

<p> estimated by multiplying the known or reported numbers by the
ratio of the </p>

<p> total relevant population to the reported population. All
figures were </p>

<p> estimated independently and total estimates were therefore
larger than the </p>

<p> sum of all subgroup estimates. The total population figure
used in the </p>

<p> projections varied, depending upon which figure was most
appropriate. The </p>

<p> two available population figures are the average daily
population and the </p>

<p> prison count on the reference day for the census, June 29,
1990. For drug </p>

<p> testing, table 8, the basis for estimation was the average
daily </p>

<p> population, and for drug treatment capacity and enrollment,
the basis was </p>

<p> the 1-day count. </p>

<p> Because the census was a complete enumeration, the results
were not subject </p>

<p> to sampling error. </p>

<p> Public use data tapes for each Census of Adult Correctional
Facilities in </p>

<p> the series, conducted in 1974, 1979, 1984, and 1990, are

<h2>Correctional Populations in the United States 1980 - 1993 </h2>

<p> <b>Bureau of Justice Statistics Executive Summary</b> </p>

<p> <b>U.S. Department of Justice</b> </p>

<p> <b>Office of Justice Programs</b> </p>

<p> <img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </p>

<p> The Nation's correctional population jumped more than 2 1/2
times from 1980 through 1993. During 1993 approximately 2.6% of
the U.S. population--4.9 million adults--were on parole, on
probation, or in jails or prisons, an increase of 3 million
people since 1980. More than 909,000 men and women were in the
custody of State and Federal prisons, 455,500 were in local
jails, 671,000 on parole, and 2.8 million on probation: </p>

<p> --More than two-thirds of the 4.9 million persons under
correctional supervision were on probation or parole. </p>

<p> --The Nation's parole population had the fastest rate of
growth, 205% from 1980 to 1993. </p>

<p> --During the 13 years between 1980 and 1993, the probation
population grew by more than 1.7 million, larger than the
increase in any other correctional population. </p>

<p> --In 1993 nearly 1.4 million offenders were in local jail and
State or Federal prison. </p>

<p> During the 1980-92 period, the percent of black State and
Federal prisoners increased from 46.5% to 50% at a time when the
percentage of blacks in the general population increased from
11.8% to 12.4%. The Hispanic prison population doubled from 7.7%
to 14.1%, while Hispanics in the general population increased
from 6.5% to 9.5%. </p>

<p> At yearend 1992, there were 4,094 black male inmates per
100,000 black adults in the U.S. population, compared to 502
white male inmates per 100,000 adult white residents. Among U.S.
adults who neither graduated from high school nor earned a
general equivalence degree (GED), almost 6% of blacks and 1% of
whites were in a Federal or State prison serving a sentence of a
year or more. </p>

<p> The number of convicted drug offenders increased ninefold
(from 19,000 to 172,300) from 1980 through 1992. The number of
violent offenders accounted for a larger share of the growth in
the total prison population (41%, compared to 32% for drug
offenders). The total number of violent offenders in State prison
increased by nearly 200,000 during the 12-year period. </p>

<p> The number of returned parole violators and newly admitted
probation violators soared between 1980 and 1992. Almost 1 in
every 3 offenders admitted to State prisons (142,000) in 1992
were probation or parole violators, compared to 1 in every 6
(27,000) in 1980. </p>

<p> Violent offenders were more likely to be sent to prison in
1992 than they were in 1980. Relative to the number of victims of
murder, rape, robbery, or aggravated assault, the number of
violent offenders admitted to State prison increased during the
12-year period, from 18 admissions per 1,000 violent
victimizations to 27 per 1,000. </p>

<p> Between 1980 and 1992 the rate of incarceration in State and
Federal prisons more than doubled, from 139 sentenced inmates
(inmates serving 1 year or more) per 100,000 U.S. residents to
332 per 100,000. In 1992 incarceration rates were nearly 19 times
higher among adult men than among adult women (883 per 100,000
compared to 47) and 8 times higher among adult black men than
among adult white men. </p>

<p> The data are from a 188-page book published by the Bureau of
Justice Statistics (BJS) and listing the correctional populations
of each State and the Federal system. The book lists jail and
prison suicide statistics, correctional crowding, electronic
monitoring, sentence commutations, jail AIDS deaths and much
more. Single copie&quot;s of the publication, &quot;Correctional
Populations in the United States, 1992, (NCJ-146413), written by
BJS statistician Tracy L. Snell, may be obtained from the BJS

<p> U.S. DRUG THREAT ASSESSMENT: 1993 </p>

<p> DRUG INTELLIGENCE REPORT </p>

<p> Availability, Price, Purity, Use, and Trafficking of Drugs in
the United </p>

<p> States </p>

<p> SEPTEMBER 1993 </p>

<p> DEA-93042 </p>

<p> EXECUTIVE ASSESSMENT </p>

<p> COCAINE </p>

<p> Availability/Price/Purity </p>

<p> In 1992, domestic cocaine prices fluctuated as successful law
</p>

<p> enforcement operations led to a short-term (3-month) impact
on cocaine </p>

<p> trafficking from South America. During April through June
1992, </p>

<p> shortages of wholesale quantities of cocaine resulted in an
increase in </p>

<p> the kilogram price in many major U.S. metropolitan areas.
Throughout the </p>

<p> remainder of the year, however, cocaine was readily available
as </p>

<p> kilogram prices in virtually all major metropolitan areas
returned to </p>

<p> lower levels. Preliminary data for early 1993 indicate that
kilogram </p>

<p> prices remain at low levels. </p>

<p> Nationwide purity of cocaine at the kilogram, ounce, and gram
levels </p>

<p> averaged 83, 74, and 64 percent, respectively, during 1992
compared to </p>

<p> 86, 72, and 59 percent, respectively, during 1991. A
temporary decline </p>

<p> in purity at all levels of the traffic was noted during July
through </p>

<p> September 1992. However, by year's end, purity at all levels
had once </p>

<p> again increased. </p>

<p> Use </p>

<p> Regarding the use of cocaine, the National Household Survey
on Drug </p>

<p> Abuse for 1992 indicated that the number of past-year and
past-month </p>

<p> users of cocaine has decreased significantly since 1985.
Nevertheless, </p>

<p> frequent or more intense use of cocaine has not shown a
statistically </p>

<p> significant change during the past several years. </p>

<p> According to the 1992 National High School Senior Survey on
Drug Abuse, </p>

<p> cocaine use continued to decline among high school seniors
and 10th </p>

<p> graders. Among 8th graders, however, survey data indicated
increased use </p>

<p> of cocaine. </p>

<p> Reporting from the Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN) shows
that the </p>

<p> estimated number of nationwide cocaine-related emergency room
episodes, </p>

<p> which had been increasing at a fairly constant rate from the
early-to- </p>

<p> late 1980s, declined significantly from FY 1989 to FY 1990.
During the </p>

<p> latter half of FY 1991, however, the number of episodes
increased once </p>

<p> again and appears to have stabilized at high levels since
that time. </p>

<p> Reporting from DAWN also indicates that the smoking of
cocaine continues </p>

<p> to be the predominant route of administration used by
patients admitted </p>

<p> to DAWN emergency rooms for cocaine-related problems. The
percentage of </p>

<p> patients who indicated that smoking was their primary method
of </p>

<p> administration increased from 34.3 percent during FY 1989 to
41.4 </p>

<p> percent in FY 1992. </p>

<p> Rates of cocaine use detected through urinalysis testing of
recently </p>

<p> booked male and females arrestees, as reported by the Drug
Use </p>

<p> Forecasting Program (DUF), remained high in many major U.S.
cities in </p>

<p> 1992. In fact, rates of cocaine use during the past year were
</p>

<p> substantially higher than those for opiate and marijuana use.
</p>

<p> Trafficking </p>

<p> Since early 1992, DEA field divisions have increasingly cited
Central </p>

<p> American countries as transshipment points for U.S.-bound
cocaine </p>

<p> shipments. Reporting indicates cocaine is transported from
source </p>

<p> countries to Central American countries by land, air, and sea
</p>

<p> conveyances. From Central America, cocaine shipments are
transported to </p>

<p> the United States by land, sea, and air directly or </p>

<p> through Mexico. </p>

<p> Cocaine traffickers, perceiving enhanced law enforcement
activity along </p>

<p> the United States-Mexican border and in the western
Caribbean, have </p>

<p> subsequently diversified their smuggling routes into the
United States. </p>

<p> DEA field divisions report that cocaine traffickers are
increasingly </p>

<p> using routes employed four to six years ago. This
diversification </p>

<p> includes greater use of the eastern Caribbean and the eastern
Bahamas as </p>

<p> well as increased importation into the eastern United States.
</p>

<p> The use of maritime containerized cargo to smuggle bulk
quantities of </p>

<p> cocaine into the United States continues to challenge U.S.
Government </p>

<p> drug interdiction efforts. Many DEA field divisions report
the use of </p>

<p> cargo containers to conceal and transport cocaine among
legitimate </p>

<p> goods. Additionally, cocaine trafficking organizations
continue to use </p>

<p> maritime vessels such as pleasure craft and fishing vessels
to smuggle </p>

<p> cocaine from source countries into the United States.
Moreover, </p>

<p> traffickers utilize low-profile vessels designed to elude
radar </p>

<p> detection for smuggling cocaine into Puerto Rico. </p>

<p> Several DEA field divisions report cocaine trafficking
organizations </p>

<p> have increased their use of airdrop operations. Cocaine
traffickers are </p>

<p> airdropping cocaine shipments in the Caribbean and off the
coast of, as </p>

<p> well as within, Central America and Southern Mexico.
Additionally, South </p>

<p> American cocaine traffickers have acquired several large
cargo aircraft, </p>

<p> thereby increasing cargo capacity while overcoming the
limited flight </p>

<p> range of smaller aircraft. </p>

<p> U.S. law enforcement efforts along the United States-Mexican
border </p>

<p> continue to force regional cocaine traffickers to alter their
</p>

<p> operations. DEA and U.S. Border Patrol seizures since early
1992 </p>

<p> indicate that cocaine traffickers have decreased the average
size of </p>

<p> cocaine shipments and shifted transportation routes to less
trafficked </p>

<p> ports of entry. For example, in response to an enhanced law
enforcement </p>

<p> presence in southern California, traffickers are increasingly
using U.S. </p>

<p> ports of entry as far east as McAllen, Texas, to transport
cocaine to </p>

<p> California. </p>

<p> Domestic Distribution </p>

<p> The primary domestic importation points for cocaine remain
Arizona, </p>

<p> southern California, south Florida, and Texas. The principal
cities </p>

<p> utilized by Colombian cartels for distributing bulk
quantities of </p>

<p> cocaine include Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, and New York
City. </p>

<p> Within the United States, cocaine traffickers continue to use
commercial </p>

<p> and private vehicles, trains, airlines, and the postal
service to </p>

<p> transport cocaine. Concealed compartments within vehicles are
commonly </p>

<p> cited by DEA field divisions. Moreover, cocaine traffickers
using </p>

<p> tractor-trailers frequently secrete cocaine in hidden
compartments and </p>

<p> among legitimate produce. Extensive use of commercial trucks
to </p>

<p> transport cocaine from the Los Angeles metropolitan area to
destinations </p>

<p> throughout the United States occurred during the past year. </p>

<p> The Cali Cartel's method of operation in the United States
remains </p>

<p> highly sophisticated and compartmentalized. U.S. bases of
operation are </p>

<p> comprised of multiple cells operating within major
metropolitan areas </p>

<p> including Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles, New York City,
Philadelphia, </p>

<p> and San Francisco. The operators of these cells receive
orders directly </p>

<p> from top-level cartel managers in Colombia, and operate
independently of </p>

<p> other cells within the same metropolitan area. The operators
utilize the </p>

<p> latest technology, such as computers, pagers, facsimile
machines, etc., </p>

<p> in their daily operations. Cellular telephones are often
bought in bulk </p>

<p> quantities and then discarded after being used for several
months or </p>

<p> less in order to thwart law enforcement telephone intercept
efforts. </p>

<p> In general, the Medellin Cartel's method of operation in the
United </p>

<p> States is not as compartmentalized as that of the Cali
Cartel. The drug </p>

<p> trafficking groups which comprise the Medellin Cartel employ
a group </p>

<p> decision-making process at the top level as opposed to a
hierarchical </p>

<p> decision-making process employed by the Cali Cartel. At the
lower </p>

<p> levels, Medellin-related trafficking groups are not as
restricted as </p>

<p> those associated with the Cali Cartel regarding the variety
of </p>

<p> distributors with whom they transact business. </p>

<p> Hispanic trafficking organizations, particularly Colombian
and Mexican, </p>

<p> continue to dominate wholesale cocaine trafficking and
distribution </p>

<p> within the United States. A greater diversity, however, has
become </p>

<p> involved in these activities at all levels of the domestic
traffic since </p>

<p> early 1992. </p>

<p> During 1992, four cocaine conversion laboratories were seized
within the </p>

<p> United States, two in New York City, one in California, and
one in </p>

<p> Florida. To date in 1993, one cocaine base conversion
laboratory was </p>

<p> seized within the United States in Hurleyville, New York. </p>

<p> CRACK COCAINE </p>

<p> Availability/Price/Purity </p>

<p> Crack continues to be readily available in virtually every
major city </p>

<p> and, to a somewhat lesser extent, many small towns and rural
areas in </p>

<p> the United States. Crack manufacturing and distribution have
reached a </p>

<p> saturation point in the larger metropolitan areas. </p>

<p> The national price for a rock or vial of crack ranges from as
low as $2 </p>

<p> to as high as $75, but generally sells for $10 to $50,
depending upon </p>

<p> the size, normally 1/10 to 1/2 gram. Gram prices range from
$45 to $150. </p>

<p> Ounce-quantities can be purchased for $475 to $2,500. When
available in </p>

<p> kilogram quantities, crack prices are comparable to those for
kilogram </p>

<p> quantities of cocaine hydrochloride, ranging from $17,000 to
$35,000. </p>

<p> Analysis of crack samples by DEA laboratories during the
mid-to-late </p>

<p> 1980's revealed that retail purity was consistently high,
averaging 80- </p>

<p> plus percent. Although current retail purity remains
approximately at </p>

<p> that level, sellers in some areas of the country are selling
poor- </p>

<p> quality crack. Adulterants are increasingly being added to
increase the </p>

<p> weight or size of the crack dosage unit. </p>

<p> Use </p>

<p> The National Household Survey on Drug Abuse for 1992 showed
that the </p>

<p> number of lifetime, past-year, and past-month users of crack
declined </p>

<p> significantly from 1991 to 1992. Survey data indicate that
314,000 </p>

<p> Americans used crack during the past month and over 805,000
used it </p>

<p> during the </p>

<p> past year. </p>

<p> According to the 1992 National High School Survey on Drug
Abuse, </p>

<p> lifetime use of crack among seniors declined from 1991 to
1992; however, </p>

<p> past-year, past-month, and daily use of crack by this group
remained </p>

<p> relatively stable during that period. Nevertheless, overall
frequency of </p>

<p> crack use among high school seniors has decreased
substantially since </p>

<p> 1987. </p>

<p> Reporting from DAWN indicates that smoking is the predominant
route of </p>

<p> cocaine administration used by patients admitted to DAWN
emergency rooms </p>

<p> for cocaine-related problems. </p>

<p> Trafficking </p>

<p> The higher levels of crack trafficking are controlled by many
small (up </p>

<p> to 10 members) and mid-sized (10 to 40 members) trafficking </p>

<p> organizations consisting of bands of individuals from
distinct ethnic </p>

<p> groups. The main participants involved in wholesale crack
trafficking </p>

<p> are Los Angeles-based street gangs, Jamaican posses, </p>

<p> and Haitian and Dominican groups. </p>

<p> Saturated markets, low prices, violent competition, and
effective law </p>

<p> enforcement pressure in major urban areas have forced some
crack </p>

<p> trafficking organizations to develop new markets. These
organizations </p>

<p> are moving to smaller cities, towns, and rural areas across
the nation, </p>

<p> creating many problems for local law enforcement and civic
authorities. </p>

<p> The largest and more advanced organizations are crisscrossing
the nation </p>

<p> in this effort, with the Jamaican posses moving generally
westward and </p>

<p> the Crips and Bloods expanding eastward. </p>

<p> HEROIN </p>

<p> Availability/Price/Purity </p>

<p> Within the United States, heroin is readily available in all
the major </p>

<p> metropolitan areas having user populations. During 1992 and
the first </p>

<p> few months of 1993, there was an increase in purity at the
retail level, </p>

<p> and increased supplies available from Southwest Asia. (Note
that high- </p>

<p> purity heroin has been imported from Colombia in increasing
quantities </p>

<p> in the past year. This heroin from Colombia, which underwent
signature </p>

<p> analysis prior to DEA's development of a South American
heroin signature </p>

<p> in July 1993, was analyzed as having a Southwest Asian (SWA)
signature. </p>

<p> As a result, it may account in part for both the increased
purity and </p>

<p> quantity of SWA heroin available in the United States.) </p>

<p> Data from DEA's Domestic Monitor Program indicate the 1992
nationwide </p>

<p> average heroin purity at the retail (street) level was 37
percent, </p>

<p> considerably higher than the average purity of 26.6 percent
recorded in </p>

<p> 1991. Heroin purity at the street level was generally highest
in the </p>

<p> northeastern United States, where a large percentage of the
nation's </p>

<p> user population lives. </p>

<p> According to DEA's Heroin Signature Program (HSP), Southeast
Asian (SEA) </p>

<p> heroin was the predominant type of heroin available in the
United States </p>

<p> for the fifth year in a row, accounting for 44 percent of the
HSP </p>

<p> samples analyzed in FA 1992 and 58 percent of the total net
weight of </p>

<p> these samples. U.S. airports, particularly New York's JFK
International </p>

<p> Airport, are primary entry points for heroin destined for the
U.S. </p>

<p> market, based on seizures analyzed through the HSP. The
nationwide </p>

<p> average net weight of airport seizures was almost 800 grams
and the </p>

<p> average purity of heroin seized at these airports was 73
percent. </p>

<p> Use </p>

<p> The National Household Survey on Drug Abuse for 1992
indicated a </p>

<p> decrease in the number of past-year heroin users. Survey data
show that </p>

<p> the number of Americans 12 years of age or older who have
used heroin at </p>

<p> least once in the past year declined from 381,000 in 1991 to
323,000 in </p>

<p> 1992. During that same time frame, however, the number of
past-month </p>

<p> heroin users increased from 83,000 to 107,000. (Estimates of
heroin use </p>

<p> from the Household Survey are considered very conservative
due to the </p>

<p> probable under-coverage of the population of heroin users.) </p>

<p> According to the 1992 National High School Senior Survey on
Drug Abuse, </p>

<p> heroin use increased among high school seniors. The survey
revealed that </p>

<p> 1.2 percent of the seniors in the class of 1992 had used
heroin at least </p>

<p> once in their lifetime, up from 0.9 percent in the class of
1991, yet </p>

<p> still below the peak of 1.3 percent reported in the classes
of 1989 and </p>

<p> 1990. </p>

<p> Reporting from DAWN shows that the estimated number of
nationwide </p>

<p> heroin-related emergency room episodes, which had been
fluctuating </p>

<p> somewhat during the past several years, increased
substantially from the </p>

<p> first to the second half of FY 1992. During that period, the
number of </p>

<p> heroin-related episodes rose from 18,192 to 24,593, an
increase of 35 </p>

<p> percent. Cities showing substantive increases during the
latter half of </p>

<p> FY 1992 in the number of heroin-related emergency room
episodes included </p>

<p> Baltimore, Boston, Los Angeles, New York City, and Seattle. </p>

<p> Reporting from DAWN also indicates that the injection of
heroin </p>

<p> continues to be the predominant route of administration used
by patients </p>

<p> admitted to emergency rooms for heroin-related problems.
However, the </p>

<p> percentage of patients who indicated that injection was their
primary </p>

<p> route of administration has decreased from 79.1 percent in FY
1989 to </p>

<p> 73.9 percent in FY 1992. During this same period, there was
an increase </p>

<p> in the percentage of patients who snorted heroin. Those who
snorted </p>

<p> heroin rose from 4.8 percent in FY 1989 to 8.8 percent in FY
1992. </p>

<p> Rates of opiate use (to include heroin) detected through
urinalysis </p>

<p> testing of recently booked male and female arrestees, as
reported by the </p>

<p> Drug Use Forecasting Program, remained relatively low and
stable in 1992 </p>

<p> when compared to rates for cocaine and marijuana. </p>

<p> Trafficking </p>

<p> Major SEA heroin trafficking organizations, often under the
control of </p>

<p> Sino-Thai and Chinese criminal groups, oversee the smuggling
of SEA </p>

<p> heroin into the United States, particularly New York City,
and are </p>

<p> primarily responsible for smuggling the largest bulk
shipments, </p>

<p> generally in the multihundred-kilogram range. The largest
shipments are </p>

<p> secreted in containerized freight aboard commercial maritime
vessels and </p>

<p> air freight cargo. Smaller shipments are smuggled in the
luggage of </p>

<p> airline passengers, strapped to the body, or swallowed. </p>

<p> In addition to Chinese and Sino-Thai traffickers, Nigerians
remain </p>

<p> deeply entrenched in the smuggling of SEA heroin. Nigerian
traffickers </p>

<p> rely primarily on dispatching large numbers of internal body
couriers </p>

<p> traveling aboard commercial airlines bound for the United
States. As a </p>

<p> result of enforcement pressure, Nigerians continue to recruit
other </p>

<p> ethnic groups, including other West Africans, Europeans, and
American </p>

<p> citizens, as heroin couriers. </p>

<p> Importation and distribution of SWA heroin is much less
centralized than </p>

<p> that for SEA heroin, both geographically and in regard to
trafficking </p>

<p> groups. Most SWA heroin trafficking groups in the United
States are </p>

<p> highly cohesive and difficult to penetrate because they are
based on </p>

<p> ethnic, familial, and tribal relationships. As a result, SWA
heroin </p>

<p> trafficking and distribution are generally more prevalent in
cities </p>

<p> having large populations from Afghanistan, Greece, Lebanon,
Pakistan, </p>

<p> and Turkey, such as Chicago, Detroit, and New York. </p>

<p> Mexican heroin is produced almost exclusively for the U.S.
heroin </p>

<p> market. The smuggling and distribution of Mexican heroin to
and within </p>

<p> the United States is controlled by organizations composed of
Mexican </p>

<p> nationals and Mexican Americans. Mexican trafficking
organizations are </p>

<p> often made up of family members, lifelong friends, and other
trusted </p>

<p> associates. </p>

<p> The availability of heroin from Colombia increased in the
United States </p>

<p> during the latter half of 1992 and early 1993, according to
seizure </p>

<p> analysis and investigative reporting. At present, Colombian
heroin </p>

<p> traffickers are attempting to establish distribution outlets
in the </p>

<p> United States, particularly in the metropolitan areas of the
northeast </p>

<p> and, as a result, are smuggling a heroin of very high purity,
generally </p>

<p> 80-plus percent. According to the El Paso Intelligence
Center, the </p>

<p> number of Colombian couriers who were arrested on commercial
airlines </p>

<p> carrying heroin into the United States increased from 41 in
1991 to over </p>

<p> 260 in 1992, with most of these arrests occurring at either
Miami or New </p>

<p> York's international airports. </p>

<p> CANNABIS </p>

<p> Availability/Price/Potency </p>

<p> Marijuana, a Schedule I controlled substance and by-product
of the </p>

<p> Cannabis sativa L. plant, remained the most commonly used
illegal drug </p>

<p> in the United States during 1992. Both the cannabis plant and
delta-9 </p>

<p> tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the plant's primary psychoactive
chemical, </p>

<p> are controlled substances. </p>

<p> According to DEA reporting, 34 percent of a non-sinsemilla
plant </p>

<p> contains usable material (the leaf and bud components) and 58
percent of </p>

<p> a sinsemilla plant contains usable material. The yield of a
cannabis </p>

<p> plant is determined by its diameter and the density of the
grow area. </p>

<p> The lower the plant density of the grow area, the higher the
yield of </p>

<p> usable material. The average plant yield for mature,
domestically grown </p>

<p> sinsemilla is approximately 1.25 pounds per plant. The
average plant </p>

<p> yield for mature, domestically grown commercial grade
marijuana is </p>

<p> approximately three-quarters of one pound per plant. </p>

<p> Marijuana prices have increased substantially over the past
decade. </p>

<p> Commercial grade marijuana prices rose from $350 to $600 per
pound 10 </p>

<p> years ago to $300 to $3,000 per pound in 1992. Sinsemilla
prices rose </p>

<p> from $1,000 to $2,000 per pound 10 years ago to $650 to
$9,600 per pound </p>

<p> in 1992. Law enforcement efforts have forced some cultivators
indoors to </p>

<p> avoid detection. Indoor growers cultivate higher potency
sinsemilla </p>

<p> marijuana, which permits them to charge higher prices.
Scarcity caused </p>

<p> by law enforcement operations also has increased prices. </p>

<p> Domestic cultivation trends of significance in recent years
include </p>

<p> cultivator efforts to enhance the potency of marijuana by
using </p>

<p> advanced agronomic techniques. As a result, the average THC
content of </p>

<p> marijuana has risen considerably in the last ten years.
Furthermore, </p>

<p> record-high THC contents were reported in 1992 and 1993.
These record- </p>

<p> high THC contents are an indicator of the continuing trend by
indoor </p>

<p> growers to produce higher potency marijuana. </p>

<p> According to the 1992 National Household Survey on Drug
Abuse, </p>

<p> approximately 67.5 million Americans have tried marijuana at
least once </p>

<p> in their lifetime compared to 61.9 million in 1985.
Nevertheless, survey </p>

<p> data indicate that the frequency of marijuana use has
declined </p>

<p> substantially from 1985 to 1992. Overall, past-year,
past-month, and </p>

<p> past-week use of the drug nave diminished by nearly 45
percent during </p>

<p> that period </p>

<p> According to the National High School Survey on Drug Abuse,
the long- </p>

<p> term decline in the use of marijuana among 12th graders
continued in </p>

<p> 1992. However, there was also a decrease in the proportion of
12th </p>

<p> graders who believed there was &quot;great risk&quot;
associated with regular </p>

<p> marijuana use, possibly presaging a reversal of the downward
use </p>

<p> pattern. In addition, among 8th graders, lifetime, past-year,
and past- </p>

<p> month use of marijuana marginally increased from 1991 to
1992. Moreover, </p>

<p> 8th graders in the class of 1992 were less likely to view
marijuana use </p>

<p> as dangerous compared to 8th graders in the class of 1991.
Also, the </p>

<p> proportion of 8th graders who personally disapproved of
marijuana use </p>

<p> declined from 1991 to 1992. These shifts in perception may
explain the </p>

<p> increased use of marijuana among 8th graders. </p>

<p> Reporting from DAWN shows that the estimated number of
metropolitan area </p>

<p> marijuana-related emergency room episodes, which had declined
from FY </p>

<p> 1989 to FY 1991, increased once again during FY 1992. The
large </p>

<p> majority, approximately 80 percent, of patients treated for
cannabis- </p>

<p> related hospital emergencies use marijuana with other
substances. </p>

<p> Patients use marijuana most frequently with alcohol and
cocaine. </p>

<p> Marijuana use detected through urinalysis testing of recently
booked </p>

<p> male and female arrestees, as reported by the Drug Use
Forecasting </p>

<p> Program, increased significantly in many major U.S. cities in
1992. </p>

<p> Trafficking </p>

<p> Mexico accounted for most of the foreign marijuana available
in the </p>

<p> United States during 1992. Colombia ranked as a distant
second as a </p>

<p> foreign source of marijuana. Commencing in early 1992,
Jamaican </p>

<p> traffickers increased marijuana shipments to the United
States. </p>

<p> DEA, in conjunction with Federal and State law enforcement
agencies, </p>

<p> conducted an aggressive cannabis eradication program in 1992.
The effort </p>

<p> resulted in the eradication of millions of cannabis plants,
the arrest </p>

<p> of thousands of violators, the forfeiture of millions of
dollars in </p>

<p> assets, and the seizure of several thousand weapons.
Moreover, the </p>

<p> number of indoor growing operations seized in 1992 (3,849)
reached an </p>

<p> all-time high. The movement toward indoor production is
believed due </p>

<p> primarily to successful law enforcement efforts to curtail
outdoor </p>

<p> cultivation. </p>

<p> The five major cultivated cannabis-producing States in 1992
were </p>

<p> Tennessee, Kentucky, Indiana, Illinois, and Hawaii,
respectively. These </p>

<p> five States accounted for approximately 44 percent of the
cultivated </p>

<p> cannabis eradicated during 1992. </p>

<p> METHAMPHETAMINE </p>

<p> Availability/Price/Purity </p>

<p> Methamphetamine is the most prevalent clandestinely
manufactured </p>

<p> controlled substance in the United States. Availability is
concentrated </p>

<p> primarily in the western and southwestern United States where
most </p>

<p> clandestine methamphetamine manufacture occurs. </p>

<p> The price of methamphetamine at the wholesale (pound) level
has remained </p>

<p> relatively constant during the past four years. Currently, </p>

<p> methamphetamine prices range from $5,000 to $22,000 per
pound, $300 to </p>

<p> $2,500 per ounce, and $45 to $200 per gram. </p>

<p> Nationwide purity of methamphetamine at the ounce and gram
levels </p>

<p> averaged 46 and 53 percent, respectively, during 1992,
compared to 35 </p>

<p> and 34 percent, respectively, during 1991. (Pound purity
levels are </p>

<p> unavailable due to infrequency of purchases at that level.) </p>

<p> Use </p>

<p> The National Household Survey on Drug Abuse for 1991 showed
that an </p>

<p> estimated 5.2 million Americans, 12 years of age and older,
have used </p>

<p> methamphetamine at least once in their lifetime. (Survey data
for prior </p>

<p> years are unavailable. Survey data for 1992 are not yet
available.) </p>

<p> Reporting from DAWN shows that the estimated number of
metropolitan area </p>

<p> methamphetamine-related emergency room episodes decreased at
a </p>

<p> relatively steady rate from the first half of FY 1989 through
the first </p>

<p> half of FY 1992. However, this downward trend reversed itself
during the </p>

<p> latter half of FY 1992. During the second half of FY 1992,
there was a </p>

<p> 52-percent increase in the number of emergency room episodes
involving </p>

<p> methamphetamine. </p>

<p> DAWN emergency room data also indicate that methamphetamine
abuse is </p>

<p> concentrated in the metropolitan areas of San Diego, San
Francisco, and </p>

<p> Los Angeles. In San Diego and Los Angeles,
methamphetamine-related </p>

<p> hospital emergencies increased sharply during the latter half
of 1992. </p>

<p> Illicit Manufacture </p>

<p> According to DEA reporting, 288 domestic methamphetamine
laboratories </p>

<p> were seized during 1992, accounting for 87 percent of all
clandestine </p>

<p> dangerous drug laboratory seizures. The 1992 figure
represents a nine- </p>

<p> percent decrease from the previous year's total of 315
laboratories </p>

<p> seized and continues the downward trend in laboratory
seizures, which </p>

<p> began in 1990. </p>

<p> The main reason for the decrease in laboratory seizures is
the ongoing </p>

<p> enforcement of Federal and State chemical-control
legislation. The 1988 </p>

<p> Chemical Diversion and Trafficking Act (CDTA) became
effective in 1989, </p>

<p> and enables the Federal Government to regulate listed
essential </p>

<p> chemicals used in the clandestine synthesis of dangerous
drugs. Over the </p>

<p> past three years, most States have passed legislation similar
to the </p>

<p> CDTA. </p>

<p> Approximately 83 percent of the methamphetamine laboratory
seizures </p>

<p> during 1992 occurred in the DEA Dallas, Denver, Los Angeles,
Phoenix, </p>

<p> San Diego, San Francisco, and Seattle, Field Divisions. This
clearly </p>

<p> indicates that the manufacture of methamphetamine is still
based </p>

<p> primarily in the western and southwestern United States. </p>

<p> Manufacturing/Distribution Organizations </p>

<p> Throughout the United States, numerous individuals, groups,
and </p>

<p> organizations-from independent entrepreneurs and outlaw
motorcycle gangs </p>

<p> to Mexican poly-drug trafficking organizations-currently
manufacture and </p>

<p> distribute methamphetamine. (Although late arrivals in the </p>

<p> methamphetamine arena, Mexican traffickers are capable of
using their </p>

<p> high-volume production methods and large-scale distribution
networks to </p>

<p> substantially increase the drug's availability in the United
States. For </p>

<p> this reason, domestic law enforcement considers the Mexican
poly-drug </p>

<p> traffickers involvement in methamphetamine a significant
threat.) </p>

<p> Chemical Diversion </p>

<p> Chemical control legislation enacted at the Federal and State
level has </p>

<p> made it increasingly difficult for laboratory operators to
obtain needed </p>

<p> chemicals. Consequently, trafficking organizations have been
forced to </p>

<p> seek new sources and develop ways in which to circumvent the
law. </p>

<p> LSD </p>

<p> Availability/Price/Purity </p>

<p> Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) availability has increased
in the last </p>

<p> two to three years and it is available in at least retail
quantities in </p>

<p> virtually every State in the United States. The sources of
supply for </p>

<p> most of the LSD available in the United States are located in
the </p>

<p> northern California area. </p>

<p> LSD is relatively inexpensive with an average street dosage
unit or </p>

<p> &quot;hit&quot; costing approximately five dollars, and often
as little as one or </p>

<p> two dollars. Retail-level doses are seen primarily in blotter
paper </p>

<p> form. </p>

<p> Currently, LSD potency or strength, which ranges from 20 to
80 </p>

<p> micrograms per dosage unit, is considerably below levels
reported during </p>

<p> the 1960s and early 1970s when potency ranged from 100 to 200
micrograms </p>

<p> (or higher) per dosage unit. </p>

<p> The National Household Survey on Drug Abuse for 1991
estimated that 11.8 </p>

<p> million Americans 12 years of age or older have used LSD at
least once </p>

<p> in their lifetime compared to 8.4 million in 1985. (Survey
data for 1992 </p>

<p> are not yet available.) </p>

<p> According to the 1992 National High School Survey on Drug
Abuse, current </p>

<p> (monthly) use of LSD among 10th and 12th grade students
remained </p>

<p> relatively stable from 1991 to 1992. Among 8th graders,
however, current </p>

<p> use of LSD increased during that same time frame from 0.6
percent to 0.9 </p>

<p> percent. Moreover, past-year use of LSD rose in all three
grade levels </p>

<p> from 1991 to 1992. In fact, past-year use of LSD among
seniors in the </p>

<p> class of 1992 increased to the highest level since at least
1985. </p>

<p> Reporting from DAWN shows that the estimated number of
nationwide LSD- </p>

<p> related hospital emergency room episodes increased from FY
1989 to FY </p>

<p> 1990. Although abuse patterns have been somewhat erratic
since that </p>

<p> period, the current number of LSD-related episodes remain
above those </p>

<p> reported during FY 1989. </p>

<p> Illicit Manufacture </p>

<p> An increasing number of individuals are attempting to
manufacture LSD. </p>

<p> Many of these individuals are not associated with the
traditional </p>

<p> northern California groups that are believed to have produced
most of </p>

<p> the LSD available in the United States since the late 1960s. </p>

<p> Distribution </p>

<p> At the wholesale production and distribution level, LSD
remains tightly </p>

<p> controlled by California-based organizations, which have
operated with </p>

<p> relative impunity for over two decades. Mid-level
distribution networks </p>

<p> in the United States are generally comprised of young adults
who have </p>

<p> known each other through long years of association and common
interests. </p>

<p> Public and private mail systems appear to be the primary
means used for </p>

<p> the transportation and distribution of retail and wholesale
quantities </p>

<p> of LSD. </p>

<p> A total of six clandestine synthesis LSD laboratories have
been seized </p>

<p> since 1981; however, these were all seized prior to 1987. </p>

<p> PCP </p>

<p> Availability/Price </p>

<p> Phencyclidine, commonly referred to as PCP, is available in
varying </p>

<p> degrees in a limited number of U.S. cities. During 1992, PCP
in liquid </p>

<p> form, the most common form available in the United States,
sold for $150 </p>

<p> to $1,000 per ounce nationally. The lowest liquid ounce
prices were </p>

<p> reported in Los Angeles, the source for most of the PCP
trafficked in </p>

<p> the United States. </p>

<p> PCP enjoyed a brief popularity in the late 1960's and again
from the </p>

<p> mid-to- late 1970's. In 1978, PCP was transferred from
Schedule III to </p>

<p> Schedule II of the Controlled Substances Act, thus
classifying it as a </p>

<p> drug with a high potential for abuse. From the period 1981
through 1985, </p>

<p> abuse of the drug escalated significantly, particularly among
persons </p>

<p> under the age of 21. Around 1986, and continuing through the
late 1980's </p>

<p> and early 1990's, demand for PCP was displaced in large
measure by the </p>

<p> widespread availability and use of crack cocaine. More
recently, </p>

<p> however, there are indications that PCP abuse is increasing
once again </p>

<p> in a number of cities. </p>

<p> The National Household Survey on Drug Abuse showed that
lifetime and </p>

<p> past-year PCP use among the U.S. household population
decreased from </p>

<p> 1985 to 1990; however, 1991 and 1992 survey data indicate an
end to this </p>

<p> downward use pattern. On the other hand, according to the
1992 National </p>

<p> High School Senior Survey on Drug Abuse, PCP use among 12th
graders has </p>

<p> declined significantly during the past seven years. This
diminished use </p>

<p> is believed due in large part to a significant increase among
12th </p>

<p> graders in the perceived risk of harm associated with PCP
usage. </p>

<p> Reporting from DAWN shows that the estimated number of
metropolitan-area </p>

<p> PCP-related emergency room episodes, which had been declining
at a </p>

<p> substantial rate during the past three years, rose from 1,353
during the </p>

<p> first half of FY 1992 to 2,380 during the second half of FY
1992, a more </p>

<p> than 75-percent increase. Cities having high or increased PCP
abuse </p>

<p> rates during the second half of FY 1992 included Baltimore,
Chicago, Los </p>

<p> Angeles, New York City, Philadelphia, San Francisco, and
Washington, </p>

<p> D.C. </p>

<p> Trafficking and Illicit Manufacture </p>

<p> Reporting indicates that the majority of the nation's PCP
supply is </p>

<p> manufactured and distributed by Los Angeles-based street
gangs. While </p>

<p> buses, trains, and airlines are used to transport PCP from
California </p>

<p> sources of supply, private automobiles are believed to be the
primary </p>

<p> means for transporting PCP across the country. </p>

<p> Four PCP laboratories were seized in 1992 compared to three
in 1991. No </p>

<p> PCP laboratories have been seized thus far in 1993. PCP
laboratory </p>

<p> seizures since the mid-1980's have ranged from three to 21
per year, </p>

<p> totals which are considerably less than the high of 79
reported in 1978. </p>

<p> COCAINE </p>

<p> AVAILABILITY/PRICE/PURITY </p>

<p> In 1992, domestic cocaine prices fluctuated due to successful
domestic </p>

<p> and international law enforcement operations, which caused a
short-term </p>

<p> (3-month) impact on cocaine trafficking from South America.
Following a </p>

<p> period of adjustment, cocaine traffickers once again found
the means to </p>

<p> facilitate the shipment of multiton quantities of cocaine to
the United </p>

<p> States. In 1992, cocaine prices ranged from $11,000 to
$42,000 per </p>

<p> kilogram nationally in comparison to 1991 prices, which
ranged from </p>

<p> $11,000 to $40,000 per kilogram nationally. During April
through June </p>

<p> 1992, shortages of wholesale quantities of cocaine resulted
in an </p>

<p> increase in the kilogram price in many major U.S.
metropolitan areas. </p>

<p> Throughout the remainder of the year, however, cocaine was
readily </p>

<p> available as kilogram prices in virtually all major
metropolitan areas </p>

<p> returned to lower levels. Preliminary data for early 1993
indicate that </p>

<p> kilogram prices remain at low levels. </p>

<p> Nationwide purity of cocaine at the kilogram, ounce, and gram
levels </p>

<p> averaged 83, 74, and 64 percent, respectively, during 1992,
compared to </p>

<p> 86, 72, and 59 percent, respectively, during 1991. A
temporary decline </p>

<p> in purity at all levels of the traffic was noted during July
through </p>

<p> September 1992; however, by year's end, purity at all levels
had </p>

<p> increased once again. </p>

<p> Nationwide purity of cocaine at the kilogram, ounce, and gram
levels </p>

<p> averaged 83, 74, and 64 percent, respectively, during 1992,
compared to </p>

<p> 86, 72, and 59 percent, respectively, during 1991. A
temporary decline </p>

<p> in purity at all levels of the traffic was noted during July
through </p>

<p> September 1992; however, by year's end, purity at all levels
had </p>

<p> increased once again. </p>

<p> USE </p>

<p> The 1992 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse (see
appendix) showed </p>

<p> that the number of past-year and past-month users of cocaine
has </p>

<p> decreased significantly since the peak year of 1985. During
1992, five </p>

<p> million Americans 12 years of age and older had used cocaine
in the past </p>

<p> year compared to 12.2 million in 1985. In 1992, 1.3 million
had used </p>

<p> cocaine in the past month compared to 5.8 million in 1985.
Nevertheless, </p>

<p> frequent or more intense use of cocaine has not shown
statistically </p>

<p> significant change during the past several years. Among the
five million </p>

<p> people who used cocaine in the past year, 642,000 used it
once a week or </p>

<p> more in 1992 compared to 625,000 in 1991 and 662,00 in 1990. </p>

<p> The survey also showed that approximately 80 percent of
past-month </p>

<p> cocaine users were young adults ages 18 to 34 in 1992. As in
the past, </p>

<p> the rate of past-month cocaine use in 1992 was highest among
young </p>

<p> adults 18 to 25 years old (1.8 percent of the U.S.
population) and ages </p>

<p> 26 to 34 years (1.4 percent of the U.S. population). The
past-month </p>

<p> cocaine prevalence rate for the 12- to 17-year-old age group
has </p>

<p> decreased from 1.1 percent of the U.S. population in 1988 to
0.3 percent </p>

<p> in 1992. Similarly, the 18- to 25-year-old age group has
experienced </p>

<p> dramatic decreases in prevalence from 4.5 percent of the U.S.
population </p>

<p> in 1988 to 1.8 percent in 1992. For the 26- to 34-year-old
age group, </p>

<p> the rate has declined from 2.6 percent to 1.4 percent. The
rate for </p>

<p> persons aged 35 and older has shown variability, but remained
virtually </p>

<p> unchanged since 1988 (0.3 percent of the U.S. population and
0.2 percent </p>

<p> in 1992). Lastly, the prevalence rate of past-month cocaine
use among </p>

<p> the total U.S. population was estimated at 0.6 percent in
1992 compared </p>

<p> to 1.5 percent in 1988 and 0.9 percent in 1991. </p>

<p> According to the 1992 National High School Senior Survey on
Drug </p>

<p> Abuse(see appendix for additional survey information),
cocaine use </p>

<p> continued to decline among high school seniors. Survey
results showed </p>

<p> 6.1 percent of seniors in the class of 1992 said they had
used cocaine </p>

<p> at least once in their lifetime, down from 7.8 percent in the
class of </p>

<p> 1991 and down from a peak of 17.3 percent in the class of
1985. Among </p>

<p> 10th graders, lifetime cocaine use decreased from 4.1 percent
in 1991 to </p>

<p> 3.3 percent in 1992. Among 8th graders, however, lifetime use
of cocaine </p>

<p> increased from 2.3 percent in 1991 to 2.9 percent in 1992,
and past-year </p>

<p> use increased from 1.1 percent to 1.5 percent. </p>

<p> Other findings from the survey indicate that fewer 8th
graders in 1992 </p>

<p> associated great risk of harm with occasional cocaine or
crack cocaine </p>

<p> use than did 8th graders in 1991. There was also a decrease
in the </p>

<p> proportion of 10th graders saying there is great risk of harm
with </p>

<p> occasional cocaine use. </p>

<p> Reporting from the Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN) (see
appendix for </p>

<p> further information on DAWN) shows that the estimated number
of </p>

<p> nationwide cocaine-related emergency room episodes, which had
been </p>

<p> increasing at a fairly constant rate from the early-to-late
1980's, </p>

<p> declined significantly from FY 1989 to FY 1990. During the
latter half </p>

<p> of FY 1991, however, the number of episodes increased once
again and </p>

<p> appears to have stabilized at high levels since that time. A
number of </p>

<p> drug epidemiologists and treatment specialists believe a
possible </p>

<p> explanation for this trend reversal is that many hard-core
cocaine users </p>

<p> are now experiencing the consequences of long-term addiction.
As a </p>

<p> result, an increasing number of users are seeking public
medical </p>

<p> assistance. </p>

As a </p>

<p> result, an increasing number of users are seeking public
medical </p>

<p> assistance. </p>

<p> Nationwide, during the fourth quarter of FY 1992,
approximately one in </p>

<p> four(28.3%) emergency room drug abuse episodes involved
cocaine. </p>

<p> Metropolitan areas having a significantly higher proportion
of drug </p>

<p> emergencies involving cocaine include: Baltimore (63.5%),
Atlanta </p>

<p> (56.3%), Philadelphia (54.1%), New Orleans (48.2%), Chicago
(46.7%), New </p>

<p> York (46.3%), Newark (44.2%), Detroit (41.4%), Miami (39.1%),
</p>

<p> Washington, D.C. (37.5%), St. Louis (36.0%), and Boston
(34.8%). </p>

<p> Reporting from DAWN also indicates that smoking continues to
be the </p>

<p> predominant route of administration used by patients admitted
to DAWN </p>

<p> emergency rooms for cocaine-related problems. The percentage
of patients </p>

<p> who indicated that smoking was their primary method of
administration </p>

<p> increased from 34.3 percent during FY 1989 to 41.4 percent in
FY 1992. </p>

<p> During the same time frame, there was a decrease in the
percentage of </p>

<p> patients who injected or snorted cocaine. Those who injected
or snorted </p>

<p> cocaine decreased from 22.0 percent and 14.0 percent,
respectively, </p>

<p> during FY 1989, to 20.2 percent and 11.1 percent,
respectively, during </p>

<p> FY 1992. </p>

<p> Rates of cocaine use detected through urinalysis testing of
recently </p>

<p> booked male and female arrestees, as reported by the Drug Use
</p>

<p> Forecasting Program (DUF) (see appendix for further
information on DUF), </p>

<p> remained high in many major U.S. cities in 1992. In fact,
rates of </p>

<p> cocaine seducing the past year were substantially higher than
those for </p>

<p> opiate and marijuana use. Among the highest was Philadelphia,
where 63 </p>

<p> percent of the sampled population tested positive for cocaine
use. In </p>

<p> New York City, the figure was 62 percent; in Atlanta, 58
percent; in </p>

<p> Chicago, 56 percent; in Miami, 56 percent; in Cleveland, 53
percent; and </p>

<p> in Los Angeles, 52 percent. Cocaine use among recently booked
female </p>

<p> arrestees was also high in many cities. In New York City, 72
percent of </p>

<p> the female arrestees sampled tested positive for the use of
cocaine; in </p>

<p> Philadelphia, 67 percent; in Cleveland, 66 percent; in
Washington, D.C., </p>

<p> 64 percent; in Kansas City, 62 percent; in St. Louis, 62
percent; and in </p>

<p> Detroit, 62 percent. </p>

<p> TRAFFICKING </p>

<p> General Overview </p>

<p> The primary domestic importation points for cocaine destined
for U.S. </p>

<p> consumption remain Arizona, southern California, south
Florida, and </p>

<p> Texas. The principal cities utilized by Colombian cartels for
</p>

<p> distribution of multi-hundred or multi-thousand kilogram
quantities of </p>

<p> cocaine include Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, and New York.
While the </p>

<p> Medellin Cartel remains a significant supplier of cocaine to
the major </p>

<p> U.S. distribution cities, the Cali Cartel continues to
control most of </p>

<p> the cocaine brought into New York City, Miami, and Los
Angeles. Staging </p>

<p> sites in the southwestern United States, where some
stockpiling occurs </p>

<p> while awaiting transportation, are supplied with cocaine by
Mexican </p>

<p> smugglers using couriers or tractor-trailers, other vehicles,
and </p>

<p> commercial cargo. Organized groups of Cubans, Dominicans,
Jamaicans, </p>

<p> Mexicans, and African-American gangs provide retail-level
distribution </p>

<p> of the drug in major U.S. cities. In addition, both the
Medellin and </p>

<p> Cali Cartels maintain operational headquarters in major U.S.
cities to </p>

<p> control wholesale distribution networks. During the last
year, as in the </p>

<p> past, traffickers shifted or diversified trafficking routes
following </p>

<p> major seizures. Traffickers appear to be only temporarily
affected by </p>

<p> the interdiction of pipelines and are taking an average of 10
to 14 days </p>

<p> to reestablish operations. This suggests continued use of
imaginative </p>

<p> concealment methods and the use or maintenance of
multiple-delivery </p>

<p> pipelines and systems to avoid law enforcement. </p>

<p> Routes </p>

<p> Cocaine traffickers perceiving enhanced law enforcement
activity along </p>

<p> the United States-Mexican border and in the western Caribbean
have </p>

<p> subsequently diversified their smuggling routes into the
United States. </p>

<p> DEA field divisions report that cocaine traffickers are
increasingly </p>

<p> using routes employed four to six years ago. This
diversification </p>

<p> includes greater use of the eastern Caribbean and the eastern
Bahamas as </p>

<p> well as increased importation into the eastern United States.
This trend </p>

<p> was highlighted by the July 1992 seizure of 5.2 metric tons
of cocaine </p>

<p> in Panama which was destined for Baltimore. Moreover, DEA
Miami reports </p>

<p> that the Medellin Cartel has established a significant
presence in The </p>

<p> Bahamas, utilizing the area as a transit point for cocaine en
route to </p>

<p> south Florida. </p>

<p> Increased cocaine trafficking through the eastern Caribbean
includes </p>

<p> greater use of Puerto Rico, which appears to be a primary
target of </p>

<p> cocaine traffickers who use it as a transshipment point for
cocaine </p>

<p> destined for the United States, Canada, and Europe. While the
smuggling </p>

<p> of cocaine by general aviation aircraft into Puerto Rico
continues, </p>

<p> maritime smuggling is the primary method of transporting
cocaine to the </p>

<p> island. The appeal of Puerto Rico as a cocaine transit point
is enhanced </p>

<p> by two factors: the first is the proximity of Puerto Rico to
South </p>

<p> America, and the second is that once cocaine is successfully
smuggled </p>

<p> into Puerto Rico, it can be shipped to the continental United
States </p>

<p> with little likelihood of U.S. Customs screening. </p>

<p> Since early 1992, DEA field divisions have increasingly cited
Central </p>

<p> American countries as transshipment points for U.S.-bound
cocaine </p>

<p> shipments. This was highlighted by the April 1992 seizure of
6.7 metric </p>

<p> tons of cocaine in Miami transshipped through Guatemala and
by the July </p>

<p> 1992 seizure in Panama noted previously. During the past
year, every </p>

<p> Central American country was cited as a transshipment point
for U.S.- </p>

<p> boundcocaine. Reporting indicates cocaine is transported from
source </p>

<p> countries to Central American countries by land, air, and sea
</p>

<p> conveyances. From Central America, cocaine shipments are
transported to </p>

<p> the United States by land, sea, and air directly or through
Mexico. </p>

<p> U.S. law enforcement efforts along the United States-Mexican
border </p>

<p> continue to force regional cocaine traffickers to alter their
</p>

<p> operations. DEA and U.S. Border Patrol seizures since early
1992 </p>

<p> indicate that cocaine traffickers are increasingly
transporting smaller </p>

<p> (10 to 50 kilograms) cocaine shipments across less trafficked
ports of </p>

<p> entry such as Calexico and Tecate, as opposed to transporting
large </p>

<p> (multihundred kilogram) cocaine shipments across more
frequently used </p>

<p> border crossing points such as San Ysidro. Additionally, in
response to </p>

<p> law enforcement in southern California, traffickers
increasingly use </p>

<p> U.S. ports of entry as far east as McAllen, Texas, to smuggle
cocaine to </p>

<p> California. Methods of Transportation and Concealment </p>

<p> Maritime Transportation </p>

<p> The use of maritime containerized cargo to smuggle bulk
quantities of </p>

<p> cocaine into the United States continues to challenge U.S.
Government </p>

<p> drug interdiction efforts. Many DEA field divisions report
the use of </p>

<p> cargo containers to conceal and transport cocaine among
legitimate </p>

<p> goods. Additionally, cocaine is sometimes hidden in the walls
and </p>

<p> support beams of cargo containers as well as in, or attached
to, the </p>

<p> vessels themselves. DEA reporting indicates an increased
demand by </p>

<p> cocaine traffickers for cargo ships in order to transport
bulk </p>

<p> quantities of U.S.-bound cocaine. Furthermore, U.S. Customs
reports the </p>

<p> large volume of cargo arriving at domestic ports, coupled
with the U.S. </p>

<p> Customs capability of inspecting only a small portion of this
cargo, </p>

<p> continue to be factors operating in favor of smuggling
organizations. </p>

<p> The use of low-profile vessels by cocaine traffickers has
made maritime </p>

<p> interdiction extremely difficult off the coast of Puerto
Rico. DEA </p>

<p> reporting indicates these vessels, fabricated of wood and/or
fiberglass </p>

<p> and measuring up to only 40 feet in length, are difficult to
visually </p>

<p> detect since their coloring blends with the ocean. Moreover,
their </p>

<p> profiles of only one to two feet above the water are not
always </p>

<p> detectable by radar. Investigative reporting indicates these
vessels </p>

<p> transport up to one metric ton of cocaine and sail directly
from </p>

<p> Colombia to Puerto Rico without being detected. </p>

<p> Cocaine trafficking organizations also rely heavily on the
use of </p>

<p> noncommercial maritime vessels. Pleasure craft and fishing
vessels are </p>

<p> used to smuggle cocaine from source countries into the United
States. </p>

<p> Pleasure craft carrying cocaine enter U.S. waters by blending
in with </p>

<p> weekend &quot;traffic &quot;along the southeastern coast
where weekend vessel </p>

<p> activity is heavy. Fishing vessels are also used to carry
cocaine </p>

<p> directly into the United States as well as to transfer
cocaine to other </p>

<p> vessels off the coast. </p>

<p> Air Transportation </p>

<p> DEA San Diego, Los Angeles, and Miami report cocaine
trafficking </p>

<p> organizations have increased their use of airdrop operations.
Cocaine </p>

<p> traffickers are airdropping cocaine shipments in the
Caribbean and off </p>

<p> the coast of, as well as within, Central America and southern
Mexico. </p>

<p> A combination of law enforcement successes, including those
of the </p>

<p> United States-Mexican Northern Border Response Force, and
conflicts </p>

<p> between trafficking organizations for control of clandestine
airstrips </p>

<p> have contributed to trafficker avoidance of landing aircraft
in northern </p>

<p> Mexico. Consequently, a number of smuggling organizations,
including </p>

<p> traffickers associated with the Cali Cartel, feel it is less
risky to </p>

<p> airdrop cocaine shipments to ground or maritime crews in
Central America </p>

<p> or the Caribbean than to land aircraft in northern Mexico. </p>

<p> South American cocaine traffickers have recently acquired
several large </p>

<p> cargo aircraft for the transport of cocaine, thereby
increasing cargo </p>

<p> capacity while overcoming the limited flight range of smaller
aircraft. </p>

<p> Moreover, cocaine traffickers within The Bahamas and
elsewhere in the </p>

<p> Caribbean continue to use smaller aircraft as decoys to
divert law </p>

<p> enforcement interdiction assets from actual smuggling
operations being </p>

<p> conducted in a different locale. </p>

<p> Land Transportation </p>

<p> Cocaine couriers employ several methods to counter trafficker
profiles </p>

<p> at or near the United States-Mexican border; these methods
include </p>

<p> traveling in family-type groups with women and children to
avoid </p>

<p> suspicion at checkpoints, hiring non-Mexicans to transport
cocaine from </p>

<p> United States-Mexican border areas into Los Angeles, and
recruiting </p>

<p> Anglo drivers and females to transport cocaine shipments. </p>

<p> Kilogram bricks continue to be the predominant form of
packaged cocaine </p>

<p> smuggled into the United States. During the past year, DEA
field </p>

<p> divisions have frequently cited rubber/waterproofed packaging
of </p>

<p> cocaine. Additionally, seizures of multihundred kilograms of
cocaine </p>

<p> concealed in U-Haul cardboard boxes and 55-gallon drums
increased. Tile- </p>

<p> shaped cocaine (2&quot;x 8&quot;x 8&quot;), vacuum-packed in
metallic-type material, </p>

<p> has also been reported. </p>

<p> DEA and the U.S. Customs Service reported traffickers smuggle
liquefied </p>

<p> cocaine into the United States concealed in water tanks of
mobile homes </p>

<p> and recreational vehicles. Traffickers also have labeled
55-gallon drums </p>

<p> of liquid cocaine to reflect the climatic conditions of the
locale where </p>

<p> the drums are shipped, i.e., a shipment to Chicago in the
winter is </p>

<p> labeled &quot;antifreeze.&quot; During May 1992, U.S. Customs
in Houston made the </p>

<p> first seizure of liquid cocaine at Houston Intercontinental
Airport from </p>

<p> an Ecuadorian national enroute to New York City. DEA Miami
reported </p>

<p> small amounts of liquid cocaine are sometimes concealed
within liquor </p>

<p> bottles. Moreover, DEA San Diego and Baltimore reported
traffickers are </p>

<p> smuggling liquid cocaine into their areas of jurisdiction. </p>

<p> Within the United States, cocaine traffickers continue to use
commercial </p>

<p> and private vehicles, trains, airlines, and the postal
service to ship </p>

<p> cocaine. The use of concealed compartments within vehicles is
commonly </p>

<p> cited by DEA field divisions. During the past year, several
cocaine </p>

<p> seizures involved multiple concealment sites within the same
vehicle, a </p>

<p> smuggling technique associated with marijuana trafficking.
Popular </p>

<p> vehicles among traffickers for transporting cocaine include
Nissan </p>

<p> vehicles and mini-vans. Additionally, some transportation
organizations </p>

<p> use rental vehicles to circumvent vehicle seizures. </p>

<p> Cocaine traffickers who use tractor-trailers employ several
methods to </p>

<p> circumvent law enforcement. There is extensive use of
elaborate hidden </p>

<p> compartments to secrete cocaine within tractor-trailers.
Additionally, </p>

<p> cocaine is often hidden among legitimate produce such as
onions and </p>

<p> watermelons. On the West Coast, tractor-trailers obtain
produce in the </p>

<p> San Joaquin Valley to conceal cocaine destined for the
Midwest and East </p>

<p> Coast cities. Concealment of cocaine in tractor-trailers also
includes </p>

<p> the use of compartments in air-conditioning units, radiators,
and </p>

<p> batteries, containers welded in tire rims, and false walls.
In the </p>

<p> Southwest, large commercial vehicles and trucks are a primary
method for </p>

<p> transporting cocaine. An increase has been noted in the use
of tractor- </p>

<p> trailers to transport bulk cocaine shipments into the Chicago
area. DEA </p>

<p> reports truckers transporting cocaine sealed in odor-reducing
wax among </p>

<p> legitimate cargo to avoid detection at checkpoints and
scales. Extensive </p>

<p> use of commercial trucks to transport cocaine from the Los
Angeles </p>

<p> metropolitan area to destinations throughout the United
States has </p>

<p> occurred during the past year. In addition, traffickers
continue to seek </p>

<p> opportunities to recruit U.S. port officials to facilitate
large cocaine </p>

<p> shipments into the United States from Mexico by
tractor-trailer. </p>

<p> Domestic Distribution </p>

<p> The Cali Cartel's method of operation in the United States
remains </p>

<p> highly sophisticated and compartmentalized. U.S. bases of
operation are </p>

<p> comprised of multiple cells operating within major
metropolitan areas to </p>

<p> include Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles, New York,
Philadelphia, and San </p>

<p> Francisco. The operators of these cells receive orders
directly from </p>

<p> top-level cartel managers in Colombia and operate
independently of other </p>

<p> cells within the same metropolitan area. Cell operators
utilize the </p>

<p> latest technology, such as computers, pagers, and facsimile
machines, in </p>

<p> their daily operations. Cellular telephones are often bought
in bulk </p>

<p> quantities and discarded after being used for several months
or less in </p>

<p> order to thwart law enforcement telephone intercept efforts. </p>

<p> In general, the Medellin Cartel's method of operation in the
United </p>

<p> States is not as compartmentalized as that of the Cali
Cartel. The drug </p>

<p> trafficking groups, which comprise the Medellin Cartel,
employ a group </p>

<p> decision-making process at the top level as opposed to the
hierarchical </p>

<p> decision-making process employed by the Cali Cartel. At the
lower </p>

<p> levels, trafficking groups can transact business with less
restrictions </p>

<p> on their choice of business associates. </p>

<p> Peruvian traffickers reportedly ship cocaine concealed in
maritime </p>

<p> vessels and aircraft to the United States and distribute it
in the </p>

<p> Houston area independent of Colombian organizations. The use
of Peru as </p>

<p> a source area for multiton shipments of cocaine was evidenced
during </p>

<p> January 1992 by the seizure of five metric tons of cocaine
aboard a </p>

<p> maritime vessel. The vessel originated in Peru and was
reportedly </p>

<p> destined for the United States and Canada when it was
interdicted in the </p>

<p> Caribbean. </p>

<p> Hispanic organizations, particularly Colombian and Mexican,
continue to </p>

<p> dominate wholesale cocaine trafficking and distribution
within the </p>

<p> United States. However, since early 1992, diverse ethnic
groups, </p>

<p> including those of Middle Eastern, East European, Central
Asian, and </p>

<p> East Asian descent, have become involved in these activities
at all </p>

<p> levels of the domestic traffic. </p>

<p> Cocaine violators in urban areas, such as Boston and Atlanta,
have </p>

<p> expanded their distribution networks into rural areas, which
have </p>

<p> limited law enforcement resources, thereby reducing the risk
of </p>

<p> investigation and arrest. </p>

<p> MISCELLANEOUS </p>

<p> During 1992, the exchange of cocaine for heroin was reported
in Boston, </p>

<p> Calexico, New York City, and San Diego. The frequency of such
exchanges </p>

<p> appears to be increasing and involves foreign and domestic
heroin </p>

<p> traffickers seeking cocaine sources in the United States. In
addition, </p>

<p> during the past year, Southwest Asian heroin trafficking
organizations </p>

<p> sent heroin and opium via the international mail system to
affiliates in </p>

<p> the United States who then purchased cocaine for export to
Europe. </p>

<p> In 1992, four cocaine base conversion laboratories were
seized within </p>

<p> the United States; two in New York City, one in California
and one in </p>

<p> Florida. One of the laboratories seized in New York City was </p>

<p> operational. This represented the first functioning cocaine
laboratory </p>

<p> seized in that city since 1987. Additionally, the operational
New York </p>

<p> City laboratory used a vapor eliminating device. The device,
the first </p>

<p> encountered by DEA that employed dry ice, allowed the
laboratory to </p>

<p> function in a densely populated area without the strong
chemical odors </p>

<p> normally associated with clandestine cocaine conversion
laboratories. To </p>

<p> date in 1993, only one cocaine base conversion laboratory has
been </p>

<p> seized within the United States in Hurleyville, New York. </p>

<p> Drug traffickers use high-tech equipment, including
night-vision goggles </p>

<p> and radios with scramblers, as well as military hardware
including </p>

<p> assault rifles, hand grenades, and bulletproof vests.
Trafficking </p>

<p> organizations use scouts with radios to monitor law
enforcement </p>

<p> activities along the United States-Mexican border. A Texas
cocaine </p>

<p> organization recently attempted to purchase hand-held radios
for </p>

<p> surveillance and body armor for their street-level dealers.
Traffickers </p>

<p> have become more sophisticated in the use of electronics
including </p>

<p> scanners with police frequencies. </p>

<p> Countermeasures employed by cocaine traffickers against U.S.
law </p>

<p> enforcement include the use of counter-surveillance and paid
informants. </p>

<p> Some traffickers study law enforcement methods of operation
by reviewing </p>

<p> evidence documents during court proceedings. Reportedly,
defense </p>

<p> attorneys employed by traffickers obtain investigative
documents through </p>

<p> the &quot;right of the discovery process&quot; and then
transmit by facsimile </p>

<p> informational reports to Colombia. </p>

<p> CRACK COCAINE </p>

<p> AVAILABILITY/PRICE/PURITY </p>

<p> The simplicity of the crack conversion process allows any
person with </p>

<p> access to cocaine hydrochloride (HCl) to be a potential
source of crack. </p>

<p> Because cocaine HCl is plentiful and cheap and can be
obtained in </p>

<p> virtually every area of the country, crack is, therefore,
widely </p>

<p> available. </p>

<p> Crack is reported by drug epidemiologists and treatment
professionals to </p>

<p> be the illegal drug of choice in many U.S. cities. Notable
exceptions </p>

<p> include cities and towns along the southwest border, where
drug </p>

<p> traffickers are primarily concerned with transshipping the
large amounts </p>

<p> of cocaine HCl, marijuana, and heroin that are smuggled into
the United </p>

<p> States, and certain areas within several north-central and
northeastern </p>

<p> States that lack large ethnic minority communities,
traditional </p>

<p> strongholds for crack distribution and abuse. Nonetheless,
three Haitian </p>

<p> crack sellers were recently arrested in Portland, Maine,
indicating that </p>

<p> no region is immune to crack trafficking. </p>

<p> Crack distribution and use appear to have reached the
saturation point </p>

<p> in large urban areas throughout the country. Intensive
competition in </p>

<p> the mid-to-late 1980's inundated the largest consumer pools
with crack. </p>

<p> As a result, a number of crack trafficking groups have
relocated or </p>

<p> extended their operations to smaller cities, towns, and rural
areas; the </p>

<p> primary motivation for this is profit. Simply put, a rock or
vial of </p>

<p> crack that sells for $5 to $10 in a large, well-populated
area will </p>

<p> command a significantly higher price, usually $25 to $40 in a
smaller, </p>

<p> less populated area. </p>

<p> The national price for a rock or vial of crack ranges from as
low as $2 </p>

<p> to as high as $75 but it generally sells for $10 to $50,
depending upon </p>

<p> the size, normally 1/10 to 1/2 gram. In general, the larger
cities have </p>

<p> the lowest retail prices. Reporting from New York City
indicates a </p>

<p> dosage unit of crack sells for as low as two dollars, while a
single </p>

<p> puff on a crack pipe can be obtained for as little as 75
cents. </p>

<p> Reporting from Philadelphia and Detroit indicates that crack
can be </p>

<p> purchased for as low as $2.50 and $3.00 per dosage unit,
respectively. </p>

<p> Prices for gram quantities of crack generally range from $45
to $150 </p>

<p> nationally. At the ounce and kilogram level, crack prices are
comparable </p>

<p> to cocaine HCl prices and usually range from $475 to $2,500
per ounce </p>

<p> and from $17,000 to $35,000 per kilogram. </p>

<p> In the mid-to-late 1980's, a readily available supply of
inexpensive and </p>

<p> high quality crack at the retail level virtually eliminated
any need for </p>

<p> users to perform the crack conversion process themselves.
Indeed, </p>

<p> quality control was a major factor in marketing the drug.
Analysis of </p>

<p> crack samples by DEA laboratories revealed that purity was
consistently </p>

<p> high during that period, averaging 80-plus percent. </p>

<p> Although retail purity remains high, averaging almost 83
percent in </p>

<p> 1992, sellers in some areas of the country, such as New York,
Los </p>

<p> Angeles, and several cities in the Southeast, are selling
poor-quality </p>

<p> crack, cut with adulterants such as lidocaine and procaine.
These </p>

<p> adulterants increase the weight or the size of the crack and,
therefore, </p>

<p> the profits. Many retailers will sell recently prepared crack
that has </p>

<p> not been dried thoroughly and is still wet from the
conversion process. </p>

<p> This practice is most profitable when dealing in wholesale
quantities </p>

<p> where transactions are strictly determined by weight. At the
dosage unit </p>

<p> or retail level, where the size of the rock is of greater
concern, </p>

<p> procaine serves to increase the dimensions of the rock by
adding holes </p>

<p> or pockets of air, giving rise to the street term
&quot;blow-up.&quot; Obviously, </p>

<p> the smaller the amount of pure cocaine present in the rock,
the less </p>

<p> intense euphoric reaction the user will experience. In
addition, a </p>

<p> limited number of retailers are selling bogus or
&quot;beat&quot; crack to </p>

<p> unfamiliar customers because their regular customers consume
virtually </p>

<p> the entire supply. Substitutes include soap, chalk, plaster,
peanuts, </p>

<p> popcorn, and candle wax, which is known on the street as
&quot;perp.&quot; </p>

<p> Practices such as these are creating an increasing number of </p>

<p> dissatisfied and wary customers. An almost inexhaustible
supply of </p>

<p> cheap, high-purity cocaine HCl, combined with a relatively
simple and </p>

<p> safe production process, makes home conversion by the crack
user more </p>

<p> appealing than the risk of purchasing and smoking low-quality
or sham </p>

<p> crack. In fact, sellers in some northeastern cities sell two
qualities </p>

<p> of cocaine HCl, a high-purity powder for users who will
perform the </p>

<p> conversion to crack themselves, and a low-purity powder for
ingestion </p>

<p> through snorting only. It has also been reported that users
in Chicago </p>

<p> prefer the freebase method of conversion in the belief that
this method </p>

<p> yields a higher purity product than the crack conversion
process. </p>

<p> USE </p>

<p> The National Household Survey on Drug Abuse for 1992 showed
that the </p>

<p> number of lifetime, past-year and past-month users of crack
declined </p>

<p> significantly from 1991 to 1992. The highest percentages of
crack use </p>

<p> were among those who were disproportionately represented in </p>

<p> socioeconomic groups that have historically faced increased
health </p>

<p> risks, including African-Americans, the unemployed, and
high-school </p>

<p> dropouts, as well as young adults aged 18 to 34. </p>

<p> According to the 1992 National High School Survey on Drug
Abuse, </p>

<p> lifetime use of crack among high school seniors declined from
1991 to </p>

<p> 1992; however, past-year, past-month, and daily use of crack
by this </p>

<p> group remained relatively stable during that period.
Nevertheless, </p>

<p> overall frequency of crack use among high school seniors has
decreased </p>

<p> substantially since 1987. </p>

<p> Of particular concern is the slight rise in frequency of
crack use among </p>

<p> 8th graders. From 1991 to 1992, survey data indicate that an
increasing </p>

<p> number of 8th grade students had used crack during their
lifetime as </p>

<p> well as on a yearly and monthly basis. Also, fewer 8th
graders in 1992 </p>

<p> associated great risk of harm with occasional crack use than
did 8th </p>

<p> graders in 1991. </p>

<p> TRAFFICKING </p>

<p> Trafficking/Distribution Levels </p>

<p> Crack trafficking is conducted at three broad levels, namely,
wholesale </p>

<p> trafficking, mid-level distribution, and retail selling. It
must be </p>

<p> emphasized that these classifications are not concrete and
the </p>

<p> activities of a specific violator or group may vary. For
example, as </p>

<p> will be explained later, the functions of a Jamaican posse
may encompass </p>

<p> all three levels within the same organization. </p>

<p> Wholesale Trafficking: Crack traffickers purchase cocaine HCl
in </p>

<p> kilogram or multikilogram allotments from traditional cocaine
HCl </p>

<p> sources, including Colombians and Mexicans. The wholesale
traffickers </p>

<p> will either package the cocaine HCl into ounce quantities or
convert it </p>

<p> into crack themselves and then divide it into ounces for sale
at the </p>

<p> next level. Wholesalers usually represent large groups that
are </p>

<p> responsible for the majority of the interstate transportation
of crack </p>

<p> and cocaine HCl intended for crack conversion. </p>

<p> The higher levels of crack trafficking are controlled by many
small (up </p>

<p> to 10 members) and mid-sized (10 to 40 members) trafficking </p>

<p> organizations consisting of bands of individuals from
distinct ethnic </p>

<p> groups. The main participants involved in wholesale crack
trafficking </p>

<p> are Los Angeles-based street gangs, Jamaican posses, and
Haitian and </p>

<p> Dominican groups. Without exception, each of these groups
started out as </p>

<p> poly-drug traffickers, dealing primarily in marijuana and
cocaine HCl, </p>

<p> and continue to sell these drugs. Similarly, street-level
sellers often </p>

<p> sell retail units of other drugs in addition to crack. </p>

<p> Mid-level Distribution: Distributors further divide the
ounces of crack </p>

<p> into dosage units for sale at the retail level. If they
purchase cocaine </p>

<p> HCl, they can perform the conversion process easily
themselves. These </p>

<p> distributors often operate crack houses or manage
street-corner sales </p>

<p> locations and supervise up to 20 individual sellers.
Mid-level </p>

<p> distributors can be either members of larger groups or
independent </p>

<p> operators. </p>

<p> Retail-level Sales: Sellers carry dosage units of crack
totaling no more </p>

<p> than a few grams at any one time. Workers in crack houses
will sell </p>

<p> dosage units from the one or two ounces that are delivered by
the mid- </p>

<p> level distributors. Retailers are typically young males who
are </p>

<p> unemployed or destitute and many of them are crack addicts
themselves. </p>

<p> At the retail level, crack is sold by countless individual
sellers, </p>

<p> usually in inner-city sections of large metropolitan areas.
Upon arrest, </p>

<p> these retailers are almost immediately replaced. While crack
sellers and </p>

<p> users are present in virtually every ethnic community and
economic </p>

<p> group, the majority are from low-income, urban
African-American and </p>

<p> Hispanic neighborhoods. </p>

<p> Trafficking Networks </p>

<p> Over the past few years, crack trafficking has expanded from
the large </p>

<p> urban centers to smaller cities, towns, and rural areas
across the </p>

<p> United States. Major crack trafficking groups, such as the
Crips, the </p>

<p> Bloods, and Jamaicans, are successfully extending their
networks from </p>

<p> large cities, including Detroit, Los Angeles, Miami, and New
York City, </p>

<p> to street corners and dwellings in virtually every State
including </p>

<p> Alaska and Hawaii. This is occurring primarily for two
reasons. First, </p>

<p> these groups are attempting to enlarge their customer pools
and increase </p>

<p> their potential profits; second, the threat of disruption by
law </p>

<p> enforcement pressure or aggressive competition has generated
the search </p>

<p> for less hostile environments. </p>

<p> Jamaican posses are making advances away from the traditional
</p>

<p> strongholds of Miami and New York City, targeting new crack
markets. </p>

<p> Areas witnessing increased posse activity include Dallas and
Kansas </p>

<p> City; Alabama, Kentucky, Mississippi, West Virginia; and the
Florida </p>

<p> Panhandle. Jamaican posses reportedly have been distributing
crack as </p>

<p> far westward as south-central Los Angeles. In a similar
manner, the </p>

<p> Crips and the Bloods or their affiliates have been moving
eastward into </p>

<p> cities such as Birmingham, Denver, Detroit, Las Vegas, and
Phoenix, as </p>

<p> well as into West Coast cities such as Seattle. Recent
reports in the </p>

<p> media suggest that these gangs are also moving into New York
City. In </p>

<p> effect, posses and gangs have crisscrossed the nation with
crack- </p>

<p> trafficking networks. </p>

<p> When crack first became available in New York City, it was
sold by small </p>

<p> local bands of independent street sellers. Quite soon,
however, these </p>

<p> sellers were incorporated into the lowest level of large
organized </p>

<p> networks. The most successful groups increased their
membership by </p>

<p> adopting other gangs through strong-armed persuasion or
eliminated their </p>

<p> leadership altogether. As the groups grew larger, they
attracted more </p>

<p> law enforcement attention. In the late 1980's, New York
City's two </p>

<p> largest crack distribution organizations, Lido and Based
Balls, were </p>

<p> successfully dismantled by Federal, State, and local law
enforcement </p>

<p> agencies. </p>

<p> Currently, the larger groups in the United States are trying
to insulate </p>

<p> themselves from law enforcement detection by scaling down and
</p>

<p> streamlining their crack production and sales operations. The
tedious </p>

<p> and labor-intensive process of shaving off dosage unit size
rocks of </p>

<p> crack from larger chunks and packaging them in countless tiny
plastic </p>

<p> bags or vials in cumbersome factory style operations is ill
suited to </p>

<p> the clandestine nature of drug distribution. Recent
disruption of a </p>

<p> large number of organizations by law enforcement has created
a </p>

<p> distribution and sales system composed of many small groups
operating in </p>

<p> a limited number of neighborhoods. </p>

<p> Trafficking Groups </p>

<p> The major crack trafficking organizations consist of street
gangs, such </p>

<p> as the Crips and the Bloods, and groups of Jamaicans,
Haitians, and </p>

<p> Dominicans. They all use similar trafficking and distribution
techniques </p>

<p> and are engaged in interstate and intrastate transportation
of wholesale </p>

<p> amounts of crack and cocaine HCl. They also have the
knowledge, </p>

<p> experience, drug connections, manpower, and firepower to ply
their trade </p>

<p> over long distances. </p>

<p> The majority of the information contained in this section was
obtained </p>

<p> from the Middle Atlantic-Great Lakes Organized Crime Law
Enforcement </p>

<p> Network Fifth Annual Conferences on International Caribbean
Organized </p>

<p> Crime held June 15-19, 1992, and June 29 through July 2,
1993, in </p>

<p> Baltimore. </p>

<p> Jamaicans: One of the most effective crack trafficking groups
in the </p>

<p> United States is the Jamaican posse. Posses consist of gangs
of Jamaican </p>

<p> immigrants, often illegal aliens, that are involved in many
criminal </p>

<p> activities other than drug trafficking, including robbery,
fraud, and </p>

<p> money laundering. From these activities, posses receive an
estimated one </p>

<p> billion dollars annually drug proceeds. </p>

<p> The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) estimates
that, </p>

<p> currently, there are approximately 35 posses operating in the
United </p>

<p> States with total membership numbering at least 11,000. Most
posses </p>

<p> maintain some type of link to the larger, more established
groups or </p>

<p> parent posses in New York City or Miami, such as the Shower,
Spangler, </p>

<p> Dunkirk, and Jungle posses. New York City is generally
considered to be </p>

<p> the hub of Jamaican posse activity. </p>

<p> Jamaican posses are extremely violent, competitive, and
individualistic. </p>

<p> As a result, the structure of Jamaican organized crime will
remain </p>

<p> fragmented, lacking disciplined organizations and alliances
which are </p>

<p> common characteristics of traditional organized crime. Also,
successful </p>

<p> prosecution by Federal authorities over the past several
years has </p>

<p> disrupted much of the organization and control of the most
prominent </p>

<p> posses that operated nationwide. As a result of these
factors, a large </p>

<p> number of newly named splinter groups have evolved under the
direction </p>

<p> of new posse bosses. </p>

<p> Jamaican posses are attempting to insulate themselves from
law </p>

<p> enforcement pressure and violent competition by distancing
themselves </p>

<p> from the often dangerous day-to-day operation of crack houses
and by </p>

<p> distributing larger amounts of cocaine, in effect simply
supplying those </p>

<p> same crack houses and street level distribution sites.
Jamaicans are </p>

<p> also initiating alliances with members of other ethnic drug
trafficking </p>

<p> groups. For example, Jamaicans have been attempting to
establish </p>

<p> connections with Colombian and Mexican wholesale suppliers of
cocaine in </p>

<p> order to eliminate middlemen and related additional costs.
Also, </p>

<p> Jamaicans have been employing other minorities such as
Haitians because </p>

<p> they are willing to work for less in the lower levels of the </p>

<p> distribution chain. </p>

<p> Jamaicans also are distributing other illegal drugs such as
heroin and </p>

<p> marijuana; a few have been able to realize higher profits
from heroin </p>

<p> distribution. Moreover, some Jamaicans have returned to
trafficking </p>

<p> marijuana because the Federal penalties for marijuana
trafficking are </p>

<p> less severe than those for crack and cocaine HCl, yet the
profit </p>

<p> potential is almost as high. </p>

<p> A common method of operation by Jamaican posses is termed
&quot;drip&quot; </p>

<p> trafficking. In an attempt to escape law enforcement efforts
and to </p>

<p> protect against seizure, loss, or theft by competitors,
Jamaican posses </p>

<p> do not stockpile large amounts of drugs and money; rather,
they move </p>

<p> smaller quantities more often and more quickly. </p>

<p> In their efforts to expand crack sales and increase profits,
Jamaican </p>

<p> posses are branching out to other cities and rural areas to
establish </p>

<p> new drug markets where competition from rival gangs and law
enforcement </p>

<p> activity is lessened. This migration has been observed in
Dallas, </p>

<p> Denver, Kansas City, Washington, D.C., and northern Florida. </p>

<p> The Southwest border area has seen a significant influx of
Jamaican </p>

<p> traffickers during the last five years because cocaine HCl
and marijuana </p>

<p> are much cheaper to purchase in that region of the country.
As a result, </p>

<p> they have set up storefronts, usually garages, hair salons,
or music </p>

<p> stores, to mask distribution outlets and to launder proceeds.
Since </p>

<p> weapons can be purchased for less in Texas than in other
southern </p>

<p> States, Jamaicans often use females to make straw purchases
of guns </p>

<p> which are then sent to New York and other cities in the
Northeast. </p>

<p> Drugs, proceeds, and weapons are all shipped to different
locations </p>

<p> using a variety of means. Commercial airlines have proven to
be an </p>

<p> effective method of transportation. When interdiction efforts
at </p>

<p> particular airports become prohibitive, couriers drive to
airports in </p>

<p> other cities to elude law enforcement. Buses, trains, and
rental </p>

<p> vehicles are also popular methods of shipment. False
compartments are </p>

<p> frequently built into vehicles for transportation of drugs,
money, and </p>

<p> weapons. Additionally, mail services such as United Parcel
Service and </p>

<p> Federal Express are used to ship drugs and profits for the
Jamaican </p>

<p> posses. </p>

<p> Dominicans: While some official estimates of the number of
Dominicans </p>

<p> living in New York City are as low as 350,000, ATF claims the
actual </p>

<p> number, including illegal aliens, may be closer to 1,000,000.
</p>

<p> The hierarchy of Dominican gangs is slightly different than
that of the </p>

<p> Jamaicans in that the Dominican bosses usually run their
networks from </p>

<p> the Dominican Republic directly, traveling to and from the
United States </p>

<p> as needed. Dominican gangs are always armed and employ modern
equipment </p>

<p> and techniques in their daily operations, including
walkie-talkies, </p>

<p> &quot;kel&quot; transmitting devices, booby traps (to protect
drugs and money from </p>

<p> police action as well as from theft by competitors), and use
of counter- </p>

<p> surveillance, which they practiced in the Dominican Republic
in order to </p>

<p> elude the police. </p>

<p> Like the Jamaican posses, the Dominican traffickers are very
violent and </p>

<p> competitive and, as a result, do not easily form tightly
structured and </p>

<p> disciplined organizations. Although some reports suggest the
emergence </p>

<p> of a Dominican drug cartel, no evidence has been brought
forth to verify </p>

<p> the existence of an organization capable of orchestrating
large-scale </p>

<p> importation and trafficking activities. However, this
eventuality should </p>

<p> not be dismissed because, since the early 1980's, the
Dominican Republic </p>

<p> has been used by Colombians as a refueling and transshipment
point for </p>

<p> drugs destined for the United States and cooperation between
Colombian </p>

<p> and Dominican traffickers has flourished. </p>

<p> Dominicans have made gains in establishing money-laundering
operations </p>

<p> and front companies, most commonly travel agencies and check
cashing </p>

<p> businesses. At times, they purchase businesses outright or
make deals </p>

<p> with the owners or proprietors to carry out their orders. It
is not </p>

<p> known to what extent drug proceeds are sent directly to the
Dominican </p>

<p> Republic. Overall money transfers are estimated to be
approximately $800 </p>

<p> million per year. </p>

<p> Haitians: Haitian drug traffickers in the United States have
been able </p>

<p> to strengthen their status in the drug trade through two
significant </p>

<p> events. First, an influx of Haitian immigrants since the
early 1970's </p>

<p> has provided a large pool of recruits for the drug trade.
Second, by the </p>

<p> late 1980's, Haiti had become an important way station for
cocaine HCl </p>

<p> shipped into the United States by the Colombian cartels. </p>

<p> At present, Haitian crack traffickers operate in a limited
number of </p>

<p> major cities, primarily Miami and New York, and have not
extended their </p>

<p> operations as the Jamaicans have. Many Haitian sellers are
moving their </p>

<p> way up the distribution hierarchy by working at the lower
levels of </p>

<p> crack operations run by other ethnic groups. </p>

<p> Street Gangs: Street gangs, operating under the umbrella
names of the </p>

<p> Crips and the Bloods, extended their networks from the
streets of Los </p>

<p> Angeles to many major American cities in the last half of the
1980's. </p>

<p> Sales of crack and cocaine HCl brought them power and
influence during </p>

<p> that time. Gang members learned quickly that the cheap
cocaine available </p>

<p> in Los Angeles could be sold as cocaine HCl or crack at great
profit in </p>

<p> other parts of the country. </p>

<p> Los Angeles street gangs are very loosely organized in small
units or </p>

<p> &quot;sets&quot; falling under the auspices of the two
predominant gangs, the </p>

<p> Crips and the Bloods. The general street gang structure
begins with </p>

<p> diverse groups of gang members acting as street-level sellers
conducting </p>

<p> transactions in amounts up to several grams or even ounces on
the street </p>

<p> or in rock houses. A few of these sellers rise to become
mid-level </p>

<p> distributors, dealing in amounts of up to one kilogram or
more and </p>

<p> working between the street-level sellers and the major
traffickers. </p>

<p> Capable of brokering multimillion dollar deals, the major
traffickers, </p>

<p> often referred to as &quot;high rollers,&quot; are not
usually visible gang </p>

<p> members and often have direct contacts with Colombian
wholesale cocaine </p>

<p> suppliers. </p>

<p> Initially, gangs sold marijuana and PCP prior to entering
into cocaine </p>

<p> HCl and crack trafficking, distribution, and sales.
Eventually, they </p>

<p> developed a mode of operation that closely resembles the
Jamaican model. </p>

<p> Typically, gang members travel to and establish crack
operations in </p>

<p> smaller cities and towns where there is little police
pressure and </p>

<p> competition from rivals. They often gain entry into a
community by </p>

<p> visiting or living with friends or relatives. In addition to
securing </p>

<p> lodgings, these visits provide access to young people,
potential </p>

<p> recruits and customers, and help them attain legitimacy and
acceptance </p>

<p> within the community. Soon, the gang members will seek out in
many </p>

<p> instances low-income single mothers and offer them $100 a day
to use </p>

<p> their apartment or house as a crack conversion or
distribution site. A </p>

<p> common marketing technique known as &quot;double up&quot; is
used by these street </p>

<p> gangs to attract new customers and involves the sale of two
dosage units </p>

<p> of crack for the price of one. </p>

<p> Sales Locations </p>

<p> With few exceptions, crack distribution takes place either in
urban or </p>

<p> suburban dwellings of all types or at inner-city street
corner </p>

<p> locations. Virtually every large city in America has seen the
emergence </p>

<p> of both of these retail sales locations. The prevalence of
one site over </p>

<p> the other may be directly linked to two factors. </p>

<p> First, weather plays a major role in determining the chosen
method of </p>

<p> crack distribution. For example, in cities with cold winters,
sellers </p>

<p> will set up crack houses to escape the elements themselves
and to offer </p>

<p> customers more hospitable accommodations. In summer, the
operation may </p>

<p> be moved outdoors where increased pedestrian traffic provides
the </p>

<p> necessary cover for street corner sales. </p>

<p> Second, the presence of significant law enforcement activity
may force </p>

<p> street corner retailers to set up indoor crack facilities to
evade </p>

<p> detection. Conversely, if gangs are suffering substantial
losses due to </p>

<p> police raids on established crack houses, they may dispatch
sellers to </p>

<p> specific, pre-designated street corner sales locations. </p>

<p> The sale of crack at street corner locations is considered to
be ideal </p>

<p> because it provides sellers many avenues of escape when faced
with </p>

<p> police pressure. If a particular street becomes too
&quot;hot&quot; with police </p>

<p> activity, the retailers merely move a few blocks away and
continue </p>

<p> selling. Moreover, tactics can be employed to mask street
corner sales </p>

<p> of crack. In New York City, crack distributors have been
known to </p>

<p> dispatch a seller along with up to 10 people dressed exactly
alike to </p>

<p> work a street corner in an attempt to disrupt surveillance
efforts. In </p>

<p> addition, street corner operations do not require
expenditures for rent </p>

<p> and utilities, as is the case with crack houses. </p>

<p> HEROIN </p>

<p> AVAILABILITY/PRICE/PURITY </p>

<p> Within the United States, heroin is readily available in all
major </p>

<p> metropolitan areas having user populations. During 1992 and
the first </p>

<p> few months of 1993, there was an increase in purity
nationwide at the </p>

<p> retail level and increased supplies available from Southwest
Asia. (It </p>

<p> should be noted that high purity heroin has been imported
from Colombia </p>

<p> in increasing quantities in the past year. This heroin from
Colombia, </p>

<p> which underwent signature analysis prior to DEA's development
of a South </p>

<p> American heroin signature in July 1993, was analyzed as
having a </p>

<p> Southwest Asian (SWA) signature. As a result, it may account
in part for </p>

<p> both the increased purity and quantity of SWA heroin in the
United </p>

<p> States.) At present, street-level purity, the key indicator
of </p>

<p> availability, is at high levels, particularly in the
northeastern </p>

<p> metropolitan areas. </p>

<p> Heroin from every major source area is available in the
United States, </p>

<p> which is the most lucrative wholesale and retail level heroin
market in </p>

<p> the world. The origin of heroin smuggled into the United
States and the </p>

<p> proportion from each source area is tracked by DEA's Heroin
Signature </p>

<p> Program (HSP). Each year an in-depth chemical analysis is
performed on </p>

<p> 600 to 800 samples taken from heroin seizures and purchases
made in the </p>

<p> United States. The samples selected for signature analysis
include all </p>

<p> DEA seizures at U.S. points of entry and other
seizures/purchases </p>

<p> selected at random from DEA, in addition to Federal Bureau of
</p>

<p> Investigation, and U.S. Customs Service seizures and
purchases. As a </p>

<p> result of signature analysis, DEA chemists are able to
associate the </p>

<p> heroin sample with a heroin manufacturing process unique to a
particular </p>

<p> geographic source area. The proportion of samples associated
with each </p>

<p> geographic area is measured both in terms of the number of
samples from </p>

<p> each geographic source area and, since 1989, the net weight
of the </p>

<p> heroin samples from each area. </p>

<p> In 1991, Southeast Asia (SEA) was the prevalent source area
for heroin </p>

<p> in the United States for the fourth year in a row, accounting
for 58 </p>

<p> percent of the heroin samples analyzed through the HSP. SWA
heroin and </p>

<p> Mexican source heroin accounted for half of the remaining
samples with </p>

<p> 21 percent apiece. In 1992, the results of the HSP were
skewed by the </p>

<p> introduction of a number of samples of purported Colombian
heroin. </p>

<p> Because a specific signature for heroin from Colombia was not
available </p>

<p> then, most heroin samples of alleged Colombian origin are
analyzed as </p>

<p> having a Southwest Asian signature. With this in mind,
preliminary HSP </p>

<p> figures for 1992 reflect that 44 percent of the heroin
samples analyzed </p>

<p> were from Southeast Asia, 39 percent from Southwest Asia or
Colombia, </p>

<p> and the remaining 17 percent from Mexico. </p>

<p> Signature analysis also reveals that SEA heroin accounted for
88 percent </p>

<p> of the total net weight of the heroin samples analyzed in
1991, and 58 </p>

<p> percent in 1992. SWA heroin (including heroin from Colombia)
accounted </p>

<p> for nine and 32 percent of the total net weight of the heroin
samples </p>

<p> analyzed in 1991 and 1992, respectively. Mexican heroin
accounted for </p>

<p> three percent of the total net weight in 1991 and 10 percent
in 1992. </p>

<p> U.S. airports, particularly New York's JFK International
Airport, are </p>

<p> primary entry points for heroin shipments destined for the
U.S. market. </p>

<p> The HSP shows that 91 percent (454 out of 498) of the heroin
seizures </p>

<p> that took place at the U.S. border and points of entry during
1992 </p>

<p> occurred at airports, and that over 75 percent of the airport
seizures </p>

<p> occurred at New York's JFK International Airport. The
nationwide average </p>

<p> net weight airport seizure was almost 800 grams and the
average purity </p>

<p> of the heroin seized at these airports was 73 percent. </p>

<p> Nationally, in 1992, a kilogram of SEA heroin sold for
$90,000 to </p>

<p> $250,000. In the northeastern United States, SEA heroin is
also commonly </p>

<p> sold in units (700 grams), which sell for $90,000 to
$115,000. The price </p>

<p> for SWA heroin ranged from $80,000 to $200,000 per kilogram.
Wholesale </p>

<p> level prices for Mexican heroin were the lowest of any type
of heroin </p>

<p> and ranged from $50,000 to $150,000. The wide range in the
price of a </p>

<p> kilogram reflects several variables including buyer/seller
relationship, </p>

<p> quantity purchased, purchase frequency, purity, and
transportation </p>

<p> costs. Numerous and diverse foreign sources of supply also
account for </p>

<p> the wide variances. </p>

<p> At the mid-level of the traffic, where dealers sell
quantities ranging </p>

<p> from an ounce to multiounces, SEA heroin and SWA heroin sold
for $5,500 </p>

<p> to $12,000 per ounce. Mexican black tar heroin sold for
between $1,800 </p>

<p> and $4,000 per ounce, and Mexican brown powder heroin prices
ranged from </p>

<p> $ 1,000 to $ 1,800 per ounce. </p>

<p> Domestic prices for Colombian-source heroin are generally
compatible </p>

<p> with the prices for heroin from Southeast and Southwest Asia.
Kilogram </p>

<p> prices quoted in undercover negotiations range up to $150,000
and vary </p>

<p> depending on final point of delivery. In actual undercover
purchases of </p>

<p> smaller amounts, one-eighth of a kilogram cost $23,500,
one-fourth of a </p>

<p> kilogram cost $42,500, and one-half kilogram sold for
$62,250. </p>

<p> Heroin is sold at the retail level in the United States at
prices </p>

<p> ranging from $10 to $50 and in quantities ranging from 10 to
50 </p>

<p> milligrams. The retail price remains relatively constant at
this level </p>

<p> because retail-level purity, rather than retail-level price,
is adjusted </p>

<p> by the distributors to account for availability and to
manipulate profit </p>

<p> margins. </p>

<p> The HSP provides purity information on heroin shipments
smuggled into </p>

<p> the United States at the importation, or wholesale, level.
For all types </p>

<p> of heroin at this level, the nationwide average purity in
1992 was 64 </p>

<p> percent. SWA heroin was the purest form available at the
wholesale </p>

<p> level, averaging 72 percent. SEA heroin nationwide averaged
slightly </p>

<p> lower at 68 percent, while Mexican heroin averaged 33
percent. </p>

<p> At the retail level, purity is tracked by DEA's Domestic
Monitor Program </p>

<p> (DMP), a heroin purchase program designed to provide price,
purity, and </p>

<p> geographic source area data on heroin being distributed on
the streets </p>

<p> of U.S. cities. The program is conducted quarterly in one
city from each </p>

<p> of DEA's 19 field divisions and San Juan, Puerto Rico. </p>

<p> According to DMP data for 1992, the nationwide average purity
for retail </p>

<p> level heroin was 37 percent. This percentage was much higher
than the </p>

<p> average of 6.9 percent recorded a decade ago and also
considerably </p>

<p> higher than the average purity of 26.6 percent recorded in
1991. The </p>

<p> increase in average purity corresponded directly to an
increase in </p>

<p> availability of high purity SEA and SWA heroin. Although
Mexican heroin </p>

<p> has been traditionally of lower purity than other heroin
types in recent </p>

<p> years, it too increased in purity at the street level.
Street-level </p>

<p> purity of SWA heroin analyzed in the DMP during 1992 was the
highest for </p>

<p> all sources, averaging 55.8 percent, while Mexican heroin, at
25.6 </p>

<p> percent, almost doubled between 1991 and 1992. SEA heroin
remained </p>

<p> widely available in the northeastern United States with an
average </p>

<p> purity of 34.4 percent. </p>

<p> Heroin purity at the street level was generally highest in
the </p>

<p> northeastern United States, where a large percentage of the
nation's </p>

<p> user population lives. In New York City, one of the major
importation </p>

<p> and distribution centers for SEA and SWA heroin, the average
purity at </p>

<p> the street level for these types of heroin was, respectively,
54.3 </p>

<p> percent and 69.7 percent. Boston recorded the highest average
purity of </p>

<p> retail level heroin in all of the DMP cities with an average
of 73.7 </p>

<p> percent during 1992. </p>

<p> USE </p>

<p> The National Household Survey on Drug Abuse for 1992
indicated a </p>

<p> decrease in the number of past-year heroin users. Survey data
show that </p>

<p> the number of Americans 12 years of age or older who have
used heroin at </p>

<p> least once in the past year declined from 381,000 in 1991 to
323,000 in </p>

<p> 1992. During that same time frame, however, the number of
past-month </p>

<p> heroin users increased from 83,000 to 107,000. The increase
in the </p>

<p> number of lifetime heroin users to 2,653,000 in 1991 appears
to have </p>

<p> been an anomaly, as the 1992 estimate has declined to
1,840,000. </p>

<p> (Estimates of heroin use from the Household Survey are
considered very </p>

<p> conservative due to the probable under coverage of the
population of </p>

<p> heroin users.) </p>

<p> According to the 1992 National High School Senior Survey on
Drug Abuse, </p>

<p> heroin use increased among high school seniors. Although 1.2
percent of </p>

<p> the seniors in the class of 1992 reported they had used
heroin at least </p>

<p> once in their lifetime, up from 0.9 percent in the class of
1991, it was </p>

<p> still below the peak of 1.3 percent reported in the classes
of 1989 and </p>

<p> 1990. Moreover, for the first time in recent years, there was
a </p>

<p> statistically significant decline among seniors in the
perceived risk of </p>

<p> harm associated with heroin use. </p>

<p> The National High School Survey also shows that lifetime
heroin use </p>

<p> among 8th graders increased from 1.2 percent in 1991 to 1.4
percent in </p>

<p> 1992, past year use remained steady, and past-month use
increased from a </p>

<p> 0.3 percent in 1991 to 0.4 percent in 1992. Among 10th
graders, both </p>

<p> lifetime and past-month use remained stable from 1991 to
1992, while </p>

<p> past-year heroin use increased form 0.5 percent to 0.6
percent. </p>

<p> Reporting from DAWN shows that the estimated number of
nationwide </p>

<p> heroin-related emergency room episodes, which had been
fluctuating </p>

<p> somewhat during the past several years, increased
substantially from the </p>

<p> first to second half of FY 1992. During that time frame, the
number of </p>

<p> heroin-related episodes rose from 18,192 to 24,593, an
increase of 35 </p>

<p> percent. Cities showing substantive increases during the
latter half of </p>

<p> FY 1992 in the number of heroin-related emergency room
episodes included </p>

<p> Baltimore, Boston, Los Angeles, New York City, and Seattle. </p>

<p> Possible explanations for the rising levels of heroin-related
emergency </p>

<p> room episodes have been provided by a number of drug
epidemiologists and </p>

<p> treatment specialists. Reports indicate that segments of the
crack </p>

<p> cocaine user population are using or switching to heroin as a
means to </p>

<p> mitigate the depressive effects associated with withdrawal
from crack. </p>

<p> There are additional reports of the appearance, in a limited
number of </p>

<p> areas, of new distributors attempting to establish markets as
well as </p>

<p> the growing involvement of youth gangs in the heroin traffic.
Moreover, </p>

<p> heroin is now being sold in white as well as African-American
and </p>

<p> Hispanic neighborhoods in a limited number of cities. In New
York City, </p>

<p> anecdotal information indicates that more teenagers and
females are </p>

<p> selling heroin than in the past. Lastly, there is a
perception among </p>

<p> some users that heroin is a safer drug than cocaine, while
certain </p>

<p> others consider heroin use to be &quot;cool.&quot; The latter
represents a radical </p>

<p> departure from previous attitudes toward heroin use. </p>

<p> Reporting from DAWN also indicates that the injection of
heroin </p>

<p> continues to be the predominant route of administration used
by patients </p>

<p> admitted to DAWN emergency rooms for heroin-related problems.
However, </p>

<p> the percentage of patients who indicated that injection was
their </p>

<p> primary route of administration has decreased from 79.1
percent in FY </p>

<p> 1989 to 73.9 percent in FY 1992. During this same time frame,
there was </p>

<p> an increase in the percentage of patients who snorted heroin.
Those who </p>

<p> snorted heroin rose from 4.8 percent in FY 1989 to 8.8
percent in FY </p>

<p> 1992. Increases in snorting are attributed, in part, to a
fear of </p>

<p> contracting AIDS through needle sharing and the availability
of high- </p>

<p> purity heroin on the street. </p>

<p> Opiate use (to include heroin) among recently booked
arrestees as </p>

<p> reported by the DUF Program remained relatively low and
stable in 1992 </p>

<p> when compared to rates for cocaine and marijuana. Cities
having the </p>

<p> highest percentage of positive urinalysis tests for heroin
among booked </p>

<p> male arrestees in the first half of 1992 were Chicago at 19
percent; New </p>

<p> York City at 18 percent; San Antonio at 15 percent; San Diego
at 16 </p>

<p> percent; Washington, D.C., at 11 percent; Los Angeles at 11
percent; and </p>

<p> Philadelphia at 12 percent. Female arrestees tested positive
at high </p>

<p> rates in New York City (24%), Portland (22%), Washington,
D.C., (19%), </p>

<p> San Diego (17%), Detroit (15%), Phoenix (15%), San Antonio
(14%), and </p>

<p> Los Angeles (13%). </p>

<p> TRAFFICKING </p>

<p> SEA Heroin Trafficking </p>

<p> Major SEA heroin trafficking organizations, often under the
control of </p>

<p> Sino-Thai and Chinese criminal groups, oversee the smuggling
of SEA </p>

<p> heroin into the United States. Chinese traffickers in the
United States </p>

<p> with links to these international criminal groups are the
most prolific </p>

<p> importers and distributors of heroin from Southeast Asia.
Chinese or </p>

<p> Thai nationals are often used to transport the heroin and are
generally </p>

<p> responsible for the largest bulk shipments, in the
multihundred kilogram </p>

<p> range, of SEA heroin smuggled into the United States. </p>

<p> Around 1986, these Chinese smuggling groups took over the
multibillion </p>

<p> dollar wholesale heroin trade that had been controlled for
over two </p>

<p> decades by Traditional Organized Crime groups in the United
States. Over </p>

<p> the next few years, ethnic Chinese traffickers flooded the
northeastern </p>

<p> United States, the largest heroin market in the country, with
bulk </p>

<p> shipments of high-purity SEA heroin. In recent years, these
highly </p>

<p> structured clandestine Chinese organizations have increased
the size and </p>

<p> number of heroin shipments to the United States. In the wake
of </p>

<p> increased availability, the layers of mid-level distributors
in the New </p>

<p> York City area were eliminated and Chinese wholesalers sold
directly to </p>

<p> Dominican street-level dealers, a development that resulted
in enhanced </p>

<p> heroin purity at the street level. </p>

<p> SEA heroin traffickers use a variety of transportation routes
to smuggle </p>

<p> heroin into the United States from the Far East. One of the
major routes </p>

<p> originates in Bangkok and terminates in New York City, the
largest </p>

<p> heroin importation and distribution center in the United
States. (Each </p>

<p> year since 1986, roughly half of DEA's nationwide seizures
occur in the </p>

<p> New York City metropolitan area.) Maritime cargo shipments
are the </p>

<p> primary transport method for smugglers using this route and
the </p>

<p> shipments may transit a variety of countries including Hong
Kong, Japan, </p>

<p> Korea, the Philippines, Singapore, and Taiwan. Many shipments
from the </p>

<p> Far East are also transshipped through Canada and then into
the </p>

<p> northeastern United States. Traffickers smuggle heroin
shipments aboard </p>

<p> commercial airlines originating in Bangkok and then transit
almost any </p>

<p> Asian city, as well as a number of cities in Europe and
Canada. In </p>

<p> addition to New York City, other U.S. cities in the
Northeast, including </p>

<p> Boston and Philadelphia, are also used as entry points.
Traffickers also </p>

<p> use West Coast cities such as Los Angeles, San Francisco, and
Seattle as </p>

<p> entry points for heroin shipments destined for the Northeast.
</p>

<p> Chinese traffickers employ a variety of smuggling methods.
Generally, </p>

<p> the size of the heroin shipment determines the smuggling
method. The </p>

<p> largest shipments, ranging from 50- to multihundred-kilogram
quantities, </p>

<p> are secreted in containerized freight aboard commercial
marine vessels </p>

<p> and air freight cargo. Smaller shipments are concealed in the
luggage of </p>

<p> airline passengers, strapped to the body, or swallowed. SEA
heroin </p>

<p> smugglers also use the mails and delivery services to
transport </p>

<p> multigram to kilogram quantities into the country. </p>

<p> Traffickers using commercial cargo originating in source
countries </p>

<p> frequently attempt to disguise the origin of the cargo
shipment by first </p>

<p> transshipping containers through several other countries or
by </p>

<p> falsifying the container documentation. In 1992, 35 kilograms
of heroin, </p>

<p> which were shipped from Singapore concealed in ceramic tiles,
were </p>

<p> seized in Newark, New Jersey. In May 1991, the largest heroin
seizure in </p>

<p> U.S. history occurred near Oakland, California, when 494
kilograms of </p>

<p> SEA heroin were seized from a commercial cargo of plastic
bags aboard a </p>

<p> merchant vessel. The shipment originated in Thailand and was </p>

<p> transshipped through Taiwan prior to importation into the
United States. </p>

<p> In addition to the Chinese and Sino-Thai traffickers,
Nigerians remain </p>

<p> deeply entrenched in the smuggling of SEA heroin. Nigerian
traffickers </p>

<p> dispatch large numbers of internal body couriers traveling
aboard </p>

<p> commercial airlines bound for the United States. These
&quot;swallowers,&quot; </p>

<p> including Nigerians as well as other nationalities recruited
as </p>

<p> couriers, can smuggle up to two-kilogram amounts of SEA
heroin per trip. </p>

<p> Moreover, recent reporting suggests that a number of Nigerian
</p>

<p> trafficking groups are experimenting with smuggling larger </p>

<p> (multikilogram) shipments of heroin concealed in commercial
maritime </p>

<p> cargo. </p>

<p> Most Nigerian organizations are based in Lagos, Nigeria.
Since they are </p>

<p> formed along tribal lines at the senior levels, the
organizations are </p>

<p> close-knit. Drug barons who control the Nigerian
organizations remain </p>

<p> well-insulated by directing lower-level traffickers to
recruit the </p>

<p> numerous couriers, often non-Nigerians, and to organize
travel to the </p>

<p> United States. In 1992, Nigerians returned almost all profits
generated </p>

<p> in the United States to Lagos, Nigeria, or to Europe for
laundering. </p>

<p> As a result of enforcement pressure, Nigerians continue to
recruit other </p>

<p> ethnic groups, including other West Africans, Europeans, and
American </p>

<p> citizens, as heroin couriers. New York's JFK International
Airport was </p>

<p> the entry point used most frequently by Nigerian trafficking </p>

<p> organizations in 1992. However, during the past year,
Nigerian </p>

<p> traffickers diversified both the smuggling routes used to
reach the </p>

<p> United States and their points of entry into the country. For
example, </p>

<p> West Africans, in all likelihood controlled by Nigerians,
made a limited </p>

<p> number of attempts to smuggle heroin through entry points
along the </p>

<p> United States Southwest border and the Canadian border during
1992. </p>

<p> Nigerians have established heroin distribution networks in
U.S. cities </p>

<p> with well-established Nigerian populations such as Atlanta,
Baltimore, </p>

<p> Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Newark, New York, and Washington,
D.C. These </p>

<p> networks are capable of supplying heroin ranging from
100-gram to </p>

<p> multikilogram quantities on a regular basis. During 1992,
reporting from </p>

<p> a DEA investigation in Dallas indicated that Nigerian heroin
traffickers </p>

<p> collaborated with members of Jamaican posses in distributing
heroin from </p>

<p> Jamaican-controlled crack houses in Dallas and hired posse
members as </p>

<p> enforcers to protect Nigerian operations. </p>

<p> SWA Heroin Trafficking </p>

<p> SWA heroin in the United States increased in availability and
purity </p>

<p> during 1992 and the first few months of 1993. While some of
the rise in </p>

<p> purity levels for SWA heroin is in all likelihood
attributable to the </p>

<p> influx of high-purity heroin from Colombia, investigative
reporting and </p>

<p> laboratory analysis show that traditional SWA heroin
traffickers are </p>

<p> also smuggling a purer form of heroin into the United States.
</p>

<p> Importation and distribution of SWA heroin is much less
centralized than </p>

<p> that for SEA heroin, both geographically and in regard to
trafficking </p>

<p> groups. A number of ethnic groups from Southwest Asia, the
Middle East, </p>

<p> and Europe are active in smuggling SWA heroin into the United
States, </p>

<p> and its distribution; these ethnic groups include Afghans,
Greeks, </p>

<p> Iranians, Israelis, Lebanese, Pakistanis, and Turks. SWA
heroin is </p>

<p> transported to the United States directly from producing
countries, as </p>

<p> well as transshipped through Europe and Africa. Significant
quantities </p>

<p> of SWA heroin bound for the United States are also
transshipped through </p>

<p> the Canadian cities of Montreal, Toronto, and Vancouver.
Although New </p>

<p> York City is a major SWA heroin importation and distribution
center, </p>

<p> heroin is also smuggled into and distributed throughout the
Northeast; </p>

<p> in Mid-Atlantic cities such as Baltimore and Washington,
D.C.; in some </p>

<p> cities on the West Coast such as Los Angeles, San Diego, and
San </p>

<p> Francisco; in some Midwestern cities including Chicago and
Detroit; and </p>

<p> in Puerto Rico. Other points of entry for SWA heroin include
Houston and </p>

<p> Miami. </p>

<p> Most SWA heroin trafficking groups in the United States are
highly </p>

<p> cohesive and difficult to penetrate because they are based on
ethnic, </p>

<p> familial, and tribal relationships. SWA heroin importers and
wholesale </p>

<p> level distributors generally are very cautious and rarely
transact with </p>

<p> outsiders. As a result, SWA heroin trafficking and
distribution are </p>

<p> generally more prevalent in cities that have large
populations from </p>

<p> Afghanistan, Greece, Lebanon, Pakistan, and Turkey, such as
Chicago, </p>

<p> Detroit, and New York City. </p>

<p> SWA heroin traffickers rely less on commercial cargo as a
smuggling </p>

<p> method than their counterparts from Southeast Asia.
Generally, SWA </p>

<p> heroin traffickers, unlike Chinese traffickers, do not
smuggle heroin on </p>

<p> a large scale, such as multiple bulk shipments. However, they
are able </p>

<p> to regularly smuggle shipments ranging from one to 20
kilograms and, on </p>

<p> occasion, larger amounts. Many SWA heroin trafficking
organizations use </p>

<p> commercial cargo and couriers aboard commercial airlines to
smuggle one </p>

<p> to five kilograms on a steady basis. However, several
organizations are </p>

<p> capable of smuggling from five- to 10 kilogram shipments
aboard maritime </p>

<p> vessels on a fairly regular basis. </p>

<p> Pakistani traffickers, who smuggle SWA heroin, control
importation </p>

<p> routes into the United States and distribution networks in
New York City </p>

<p> and other cities in the East and Midwest. This heroin is
occasionally </p>

<p> transshipped through California as well. Pakistani
traffickers are adept </p>

<p> at developing new smuggling techniques and unique concealment
methods, </p>

<p> such as specially designed vests with pockets to conceal
heroin, which </p>

<p> are worn underneath the clothes of couriers on airlines. </p>

<p> Pakistanis regularly transact business with Afghan and Indian
</p>

<p> traffickers, and other ethnic groups from Southwest and South
Asia. Some </p>

<p> Nigerians still smuggle and distribute SWA heroin but most
are now more </p>

<p> active in trafficking SEA heroin. </p>

<p> Lebanese trafficking groups appear to be increasing their
level of </p>

<p> smuggling into and distribution in the United States,
particularly in </p>

<p> Boston, Detroit, and New York, cities with large Lebanese
communities. </p>

<p> Moreover, some SWA heroin originally destined for the
European market is </p>

<p> now smuggled into the United States because Lebanese
traffickers, in an </p>

<p> effort to maximize profit margins, are exchanging SWA heroin
for cocaine </p>

<p> with Colombian cocaine organizations. (At the wholesale
level, heroin </p>

<p> prices in the United States are higher than in Europe, while
cocaine </p>

<p> prices in Europe are higher than in the United States.) </p>

<p> Mexican Heroin Trafficking </p>

<p> Mexican heroin, in brown powder form as well as the more
widely </p>

<p> available black tar form, is produced almost exclusively for
the U.S. </p>

<p> heroin market. The smuggling and distribution of Mexican
heroin to and </p>

<p> within the United States is controlled by organizations
composed of </p>

<p> Mexican nationals and Mexican-Americans. Mexican trafficking </p>

<p> organizations are often made up of family members, lifelong
friends, and </p>

<p> other trusted associates. </p>

<p> While some Mexican organizations control the entire process
from opium </p>

<p> production and heroin processing in Mexico to the management
of </p>

<p> transportation and distribution networks in the United
States, other </p>

<p> trafficking organizations operate independently on a smaller
scale. </p>

<p> Mexico's extensive land border with the United States
provides smugglers </p>

<p> numerous entry points into the country. Heroin is smuggled
across the </p>

<p> U.S. Southwest border in relatively small amounts, most often
ranging </p>

<p> from gram- to multiounce quantities, by large numbers of
illegal </p>

<p> immigrants and migrant workers. Occasionally, there are large
seizures, </p>

<p> such as the April 1993 seizure of approximately 10 kilograms
of black </p>

<p> tar heroin at Blythe, California, but such amounts are the
exception. </p>

<p> Generally, Mexican heroin seizures do not exceed one or two
kilograms. </p>

<p> The use of numerous couriers to smuggle relatively small
quantities of </p>

<p> Mexican heroin is characteristic of the smuggling methods
employed by </p>

<p> Mexican heroin traffickers. These traffickers take advantage
of their </p>

<p> close proximity to the United States by stockpiling the
larger </p>

<p> quantities of heroin in Mexico and then smuggling smaller
amounts as </p>

<p> transactions in the United States are arranged. Most
traffickers believe </p>

<p> their heroin stockpiles are less susceptible to law
enforcement in </p>

<p> Mexico, and by storing heroin there they minimize the danger
of U.S. </p>

<p> authorities seizing significant amounts of heroin. According
to </p>

<p> investigative reporting, even large poly-drug Mexican
organizations, </p>

<p> which are capable of smuggling multiton quantities of cocaine
and </p>

<p> marijuana, limit smuggling of Mexican heroin into the United
States to </p>

<p> kilogram and smaller amounts. </p>

<p> Traffickers who distribute Mexican heroin within the United
States are </p>

<p> generally Mexican immigrants, primarily from the States of
Durango, </p>

<p> Michoacan, Nuevo Leon, and Sinaloa. Mexican organizations
control </p>

<p> distribution at the wholesale level but are not generally
involved in </p>

<p> street sales which are often managed by local gangs. </p>

<p> Smuggling methods include concealment in motor vehicles,
public </p>

<p> transportation vehicles, internal and external body carry,
and </p>

<p> commercial package express services. Females are used much
more </p>

<p> frequently than males as couriers for transporting heroin and
money </p>

<p> across the border. </p>

<p> Once the heroin is smuggled into the United States,
transportation is </p>

<p> arranged to metropolitan areas in the western and
southwestern States </p>

<p> where there are sizable populations of Mexican immigrants.
Heroin is </p>

<p> also transported to the Chicago, Denver, and St. Louis
metropolitan </p>

<p> areas, primary markets for Mexican heroin. In the United
States, Mexican </p>

<p> black tar heroin is usually sold by the &quot;piece&quot; or
Mexican ounce, which </p>

<p> weighs 25 grams. </p>

<p> Colombian Heroin Trafficking </p>

<p> The availability of heroin from Colombia increased in the
United States </p>

<p> during the latter half of 1992 and early 1993, according to
seizure </p>

<p> analysis and investigative reporting. While most evidence
suggests that </p>

<p> Colombian traffickers are still operating at a fairly low
level, the </p>

<p> potential of the Colombian heroin threat is serious,
primarily because </p>

<p> of the smuggling resources controlled by the Colombian
cocaine cartels. </p>

<p> At present, Colombian heroin traffickers are attempting to
establish </p>

<p> distribution outlets in the United States, particularly in
the </p>

<p> metropolitan areas of the Northeast, and, as a result, are
smuggling a </p>

<p> heroin of very high purity, generally 80-plus percent. The
high purity </p>

<p> is essential in order for the Colombian traffickers to break
into the </p>

<p> fiercely competitive retail heroin markets in Boston, Newark,
New York </p>

<p> City, and Philadelphia, where street level purity averages
over 50 </p>

<p> percent. Colombian heroin is also available in southern New
England </p>

<p> cities, such as Hartford and Bridgeport, Connecticut, and
Providence, </p>

<p> Rhode Island, where, according to reporting from the Boston
Field </p>

<p> Division, Cali Cartel cocaine networks are operating.
Currently, </p>

<p> significant investigations of Colombian heroin trafficking
organizations </p>

<p> are underway in Miami, Newark, New York City, San Diego, and
San Juan, </p>

<p> Puerto Rico. </p>

<p> Since 1991, most of the Colombian heroin smuggled into the
United States </p>

<p> has been transported by couriers aboard commercial airlines,
a method </p>

<p> requiring numerous couriers carrying amounts ranging up to a
kilogram </p>

<p> per trip. Colombian couriers commonly transport the heroin in
false- </p>

<p> sided briefcases and luggage, inside hollowed-out shoe soles,
or by </p>

<p> internal body carry methods. Much of this activity appears to
be the </p>

<p> work of smaller, independent Colombian traffickers, according
to </p>

<p> investigative reporting from the DEA Bogota Country Office. </p>

<p> According to the El Paso Intelligence Center, the number of
Colombian </p>

<p> couriers who were arrested on commercial airlines carrying
heroin into </p>

<p> the United States increased from 41 in 1991 to over 260 in
1992; most of </p>

<p> these seizures occurred at either Miami or New York's
international </p>

<p> airports. The majority of Colombian couriers arrested in
Miami confessed </p>

<p> to being en route to New York City or possessed follow-on
tickets for </p>

<p> that destination. Individuals with an end destination of
Miami were </p>

<p> often instructed to check into a local hotel and await
further </p>

<p> instructions. </p>

<p> The primary method of smuggling (ingestion) employed by
Colombian </p>

<p> traffickers and the seizure amounts (usually less than 500
grams) </p>

<p> indicate that Colombian traffickers presently are not able to
supply </p>

<p> heroin on the same scale as Chinese, Nigerian, or Southwest
Asian </p>

<p> traffickers. To date, the largest shipment seized involved a
June 1992 </p>

<p> airdrop of just under 15 kilograms of heroin on a Puerto
Rican beach; </p>

<p> this shipment may have been tied to the Colombian cocaine
cartels. </p>

<p> However, as the cocaine cartels become more involved in
heroin smuggling </p>

<p> and distribution, the seriousness of the threat will increase
</p>

<p> significantly, given their vast resources, control over
trafficking </p>

<p> routes, and access to a stable cocaine (crack) clientele in
the United </p>

<p> States. </p>

<p> CANNABIS </p>

<p> AVAILABILITY/PRICE/POTENCY </p>

<p> Marijuana, a Schedule I controlled substance and by-product
of the </p>

<p> Cannabis sativa L. plant, remained the most commonly used
illegal drug </p>

<p> in the United States during 1992. Both the cannabis plant and
delta-9 </p>

<p> tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the plant's primary psycho-active
chemical, </p>

<p> are controlled substances. The flowering tops, also known as
colas or </p>

<p> buds, are valued because of their higher THC content. The
flowering tops </p>

<p> and leaves are collected, dried, and then smoked in a pipe or
as a </p>

<p> cigarette. Hashish, which is processed from cannabis, is also
valued to </p>

<p> a limited extent by some individuals in the United States. </p>

<p> Typically, 34 percent of a non-sinsemilla (pollinated) plant
contains </p>

<p> usable material (the leaf and bud components) and 58 percent
of a </p>

<p> sinsemilla (unpollinated female) plant contains usable
material. The </p>

<p> higher the plant density of the grow area, the lower the
yield of usable </p>

<p> material. In addition, the diameter of the plant is more
important than </p>

<p> the height for yield predictions. Indoor plants are generally
smaller </p>

<p> than outdoor plants due to space limitations. The average
plant yield </p>

<p> for mature, domestically grown sinsemilla is approximately
1.25 pounds </p>

<p> per plant. The average plant yield for mature, domestically
grown </p>

<p> commercial grade marijuana is approximately three-quarters of
one pound </p>

<p> per plant. </p>

<p> Marijuana prices have increased substantially over the past
decade. </p>

<p> Prices for a pound of commercial grade marijuana during the
early 1980's </p>

<p> ranged from $350 to $600, while in 1992 the cost ranged from
$300 to </p>

<p> $3,000. Sinsemilla with its inherently higher THC content,
ranged from </p>

<p> $1,000 to $2,000 ten years ago. In 1992, the price ranged
from $650 to </p>

<p> $9,600 per pound. Successful law enforcement efforts have
forced some </p>

<p> cultivators to move indoors. Cultivators have increasingly
moved indoors </p>

<p> to avoid detection and to exploit the profit potential of
potent </p>

<p> sinsemilla marijuana. Indoor growers cultivate sinsemilla
because the </p>

<p> higher THC content of sinsemilla permits growers to charge
higher </p>

<p> prices. Scarcity created by law enforcement operations has
also </p>

<p> increased prices in some areas. </p>

<p> Domestic cultivation trends of significance in recent years
include </p>

<p> cultivator efforts to enhance the potency of marijuana by
making use of </p>

<p> advanced agronomic practices such as hydroponics and cloning.
Such </p>

<p> techniques also involve the use of special fertilizers, plant
hormones, </p>

<p> steroids, and carbon monoxide. During the late 1970's and
early 1980's, </p>

<p> the THC content of commercial grade marijuana averaged under
two </p>

<p> percent. By comparison, the average in 1992 was 3.68 percent.
The </p>

<p> average THC content of sinsemilla in 1992 was 8.34 percent
which </p>

<p> compares to an average of approximately six percent in the
late 1970's </p>

<p> and early 1980's. Moreover, in February 1993, a new U.S.
record was </p>

<p> recorded for the highest concentration of THC analyzed in a
marijuana </p>

<p> sample. The sample had a THC content of 29.86 percent which
is nearly 32 </p>

<p> percent higher than the previous record of 22.67 percent
reported during </p>

<p> 1992. The record high THC content of this sample is an
indicator of the </p>

<p> continuing trend by indoor growers to produce higher potency
marijuana </p>

<p> over recent years. </p>

<p> USE </p>

<p> According to the 1992 National Household Survey on Drug
Abuse, </p>

<p> approximately 67.5 million Americans have tried marijuana at
least once </p>

<p> in their lifetime. Of these, approximately 2.2 million were
from 12 to </p>

<p> 17 years of age, nearly 13.5 million were from 18 to 25 years
of age, </p>

<p> and almost 52 million were 26 years of age and older. Of the
17.4 </p>

<p> million people who used marijuana at least once in the past
year, nine </p>

<p> million used the drug once a month during 1992, and 5.2
million used it </p>

<p> once a week or more. Survey data also indicate that the
frequency of </p>

<p> marijuana use has declined substantially from 1985 to 1992.
Overall, </p>

<p> past-year, past-month and past-week use of the drug have
diminished by </p>

<p> nearly 45 percent during that time frame. </p>

<p> According to the National High School Senior Survey on Drug
Abuse, the </p>

<p> long-term decline in the use of marijuana among seniors
continued in </p>

<p> 1992. However, there was also a decrease in the proportion of
that </p>

<p> population who believed there was a &quot;great risk&quot; of
harm associated with </p>

<p> regular marijuana use, possibly presaging a reversal of the
downward use </p>

<p> pattern. In addition, among 8th graders, lifetime, past-year,
and past- </p>

<p> month use of marijuana marginally increased from 1991 to
1992. Moreover, </p>

<p> 8th graders in the class of 1992 were less likely to view
marijuana use </p>

<p> as dangerous compared to 8th graders in the class of 1991.
Also, the </p>

<p> proportion of 8th graders who personally disapproved of
marijuana use </p>

<p> declined from 1991 to 1992. These shifts in perception may
explain the </p>

<p> increased use of marijuana among 8th graders. </p>

<p> Reporting from DAWN shows that the estimated number of
metropolitan area </p>

<p> marijuana-related emergency room episodes, which had declined
from FY </p>

<p> 1989 to FY 1991, increased once again during FY 1992. In
fact, the </p>

<p> number of marijuana-related emergency room episodes rose from
9,231 in </p>

<p> FY 1991 to 12,108 in FY 1992, an increase of more than 30
percent. DAWN </p>

<p> reporting also shows that nearly one-half of the patients
treated for </p>

<p> cannabis-related hospital emergency room episodes during the
first six </p>

<p> months of 1992 were under 26 years of age; approximately 70
percent of </p>

<p> these patients were male. The large majority, approximately
80 percent, </p>

<p> used marijuana in combination with other substances. Patients
most </p>

<p> frequently used marijuana in combination with alcohol. The
next most </p>

<p> common combination involved the use of marijuana with
cocaine. </p>

<p> Marijuana use among recently booked male arrestees as
reported by the </p>

<p> DUF Program increased in many major U.S. cities in 1992. The
highest </p>

<p> levels of marijuana use were reported in Omaha, where 38
percent of the </p>

<p> sampled population tested positive through urinalysis. In
Indianapolis, </p>

<p> the figure was 35 percent; in San Diego, 35 percent; in
Denver, 34 </p>

<p> percent; in Ft. Lauderdale, 32 percent; and in Miami, 30
percent. </p>

<p> Marijuana use among recently booked female arrestees also
increased in </p>

<p> many cities. In Indianapolis, 26 percent of the female
arrestees sampled </p>

<p> tested positive for the use of marijuana; in San Diego, 25
percent; in </p>

<p> Dallas, 24 percent; in Ft. Lauderdale, 21 percent; in Denver,
19 </p>

<p> percent; and in Kansas City, 18 percent. </p>

<p> TRAFFICKING </p>

<p> Mexico accounted for most of the foreign marijuana available
in the </p>

<p> United States during 1992. Mexican marijuana is smuggled into
the </p>

<p> southwestern United States by vehicles, private aircraft,
armed </p>

<p> backpackers, and horse or mule caravans. Colombia ranks as a
distant </p>

<p> second behind Mexico as a foreign source of marijuana.
Colombian </p>

<p> marijuana is smuggled into the United States by noncommercial
vessels </p>

<p> using traditional maritime routes. Jamaican traffickers have
increased </p>

<p> marijuana shipments since January 1992. Jamaican marijuana is
smuggled </p>

<p> into the United States by private and commercial aircraft,
and maritime </p>

<p> vessels. </p>

<p> DOMESTIC CULTIVATION/ERADICATION </p>

<p> An estimated 6,000 to 6,500 metric tons of cannabis were
cultivated in </p>

<p> the United States during 1992. During that year,
approximately 3,405 </p>

<p> metric tons, representing 7.49 million cultivated plants,
were </p>

<p> eradicated. Reporting indicates that 31 percent of the
cannabis plants </p>

<p> eradicated during 1992 was sinsemilla. </p>

<p> The five major cultivated cannabis-producing States in 1992
were </p>

<p> Tennessee, Kentucky, Indiana, Illinois, and Hawaii,
respectively. These </p>

<p> States accounted for approximately 44 percent of the
cultivated cannabis </p>

<p> eradicated during 1992. Reports from Indiana and Nebraska
over the last </p>

<p> two years could signal a possible new trend in marijuana
production. The </p>

<p> two States report an increase in tended/enhanced ditchweed, a
form of </p>

<p> marijuana, which grows in the wild. Although ditchweed has
low potency, </p>

<p> it is mixed with cultivated marijuana to increase quantity. </p>

<p> There has been an increase in the cultivation of cannabis
indoors year- </p>

<p> round in elaborately supported operations that have ranged
from several </p>

<p> plants grown in closets to thousands of plants grown in
specially </p>

<p> constructed underground sites capable of producing marijuana
worth </p>

<p> millions of dollars. Growers also continued to plant cannabis
in remote </p>

<p> outdoor areas, often concealed or camouflaged by surrounding
vegetation. </p>

<p> During 1992, the 13th annual DEA-sponsored Domestic Cannabis
Eradication </p>

<p> and Suppression Program (DCE/SP) was conducted in conjunction
with other </p>

<p> Federal, State and local law enforcement authorities in 50
States. The </p>

<p> National Guard and Civil Air Patrol also participated. The
DCE/SP </p>

<p> resulted in the eradication of 7.49 million cultivated
cannabis plants, </p>

<p> 264 million low-potency ditchweed plants, the arrest of
12,369 </p>

<p> violators, and the seizure of 5,541 weapons. Moreover, the
number of </p>

<p> indoor growing operations seized in 1992 reached an all-time
high of </p>

<p> 3,849, up from 2,848 seized in 1991. Indoor cultivation
operations were </p>

<p> confiscated in all 50 States during 1992, with the greatest
number, 561, </p>

<p> seized in the State of Washington. The movement toward indoor
production </p>

<p> is believed due primarily to successful law enforcement
efforts to </p>

<p> curtail outdoor cultivation. The average indoor cultivation
operation </p>

<p> has approximately 100 plants. In addition, an average of one
weapon was </p>

<p> seized from each indoor operation. </p>

<p> In recent years, the DCE/SP has placed increasing emphasis on
the </p>

<p> investigation and prosecution of major domestic cannabis
cultivators and </p>

<p> trafficking organizations. The net result during 1992 was the
seizure of </p>

<p> assets valued at over $69.3 million, over twice the amount
seized in </p>

<p> 1989 ($29.5 million). The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,
National Park </p>

<p> Service, and Bureau of Indian Affairs also have long-term
programs to </p>

<p> combat cannabis cultivation on public lands. </p>

<p> One of the major accomplishments of the DCE/SP continues to
be Hawaii's </p>

<p> Operation WIPEOUT. During 1991, it was estimated that the
program </p>

<p> eradicated approximately 85 percent of Hawaii's summer
cannabis crop. </p>

<p> During 1992, Operation WIPEOUT's continued success was
evidenced by </p>

<p> reports that mainland smugglers were attempting to smuggle
marijuana </p>

<p> into Hawaii in order to fill the vacuum. Operation WIPEOUT is
now </p>

<p> conducted as a maintenance program. Every 90 days, the
WIPEOUT teams </p>

<p> conduct aerial surveillance and eradicate what few cannabis
plants they </p>

<p> find before the plants reach maturity. More emphasis is also
being </p>

<p> placed on arresting cultivators. </p>

<p> Another major accomplishment of the DCE/SP was the successful
lobbying </p>

<p> efforts to convince the California State Government to
consider </p>

<p> herbicidal spraying as a means of eradication. To date, the
California </p>

<p> State Government continues to study the proposal. Previous
requests to </p>

<p> use herbicidal spraying in California were met with strong
resistance </p>

<p> based on environmental, as well as political, concerns.
Spraying will be </p>

<p> conducted in limited areas on a trial basis. Kansas, South
Dakota, and </p>

<p> Texas are also considering herbicidal spray programs. </p>

<p> DEA continues to conduct a special enforcement program
entitled </p>

<p> Operation GREEN MERCHANT that targets major indoor growing
operations. </p>

<p> To date, DEA, together with State and local authorities has
seized </p>

<p> nearly 4,000 growing operations, arrested over 1,500
violators, and </p>

<p> frozen millions of dollars in illicitly acquired profits and
assets. </p>

<p> METHAMPHETAMINE </p>

<p> AVAILABILITY/PRICE/PURITY </p>

<p> Methamphetamine is available in varying quantities in most
areas of the </p>

<p> United States, except for the northeastern and Mid-Atlantic
regions </p>

<p> where, for the most part, it is encountered infrequently.
Availability </p>

<p> is primarily concentrated in the western and southwestern
United States </p>

<p> where most clandestine laboratory activity occurs.
Methamphetamine is </p>

<p> also available in limited retail amounts in the Southeast and
somewhat </p>

<p> larger quantities in the Midwest. </p>

<p> The production of methamphetamine, as evidenced by the number
of </p>

<p> reported clandestine laboratory seizures to DEA, has
decreased each year </p>

<p> since 1989. During 1992, 288 methamphetamine laboratories
were seized. </p>

<p> This is in comparison to 652 laboratories seized in 1989, 429
in 1990, </p>

<p> and 315 in 1991. </p>

<p> The decrease in laboratory seizures is attributed to the
ongoing </p>

<p> enforcement of Federal and State chemical control
legislation. The 1988 </p>

<p> Chemical Diversion and Trafficking Act (CDTA) became
effective in 1989, </p>

<p> and enables the Federal Government to regulate listed
precursor and </p>

<p> essential chemicals used in the clandestine synthesis of
dangerous </p>

<p> drugs. Over the last three years, most States have passed
legislation </p>

<p> similar to the CDTA. </p>

<p> The price of methamphetamine at the wholesale (pound) level
has remained </p>

<p> relatively constant during the past four years. In 1992,
methamphetamine </p>

<p> prices ranged from $5,000 to $22,000 per pound, $300 to
$2,500 per </p>

<p> ounce, and $45 to $200 per gram. </p>

<p> Nationwide purity of methamphetamine at the ounce and gram
levels </p>

<p> averaged 46 and 53 percent, respectively, during 1992,
compared to 35 </p>

<p> and 34 percent, respectively, during 1991. (Pound-purity
levels are </p>

<p> unavailable due to infrequency of purchases at that level.) </p>

<p> USE </p>

<p> The National Household Survey on Drug Abuse for 1991 showed
that an </p>

<p> estimated 5.2 million Americans 12 years of age and older
have used </p>

<p> methamphetamine at least once in their lifetime. (Lifetime
prevalence </p>

<p> rates for 1985, 1988, and 1990 are not available. The
lifetime </p>

<p> prevalence rate for 1992 is not yet available. Data
concerning past- </p>

<p> year, past-month, weekly, and daily prevalence rates for
methamphetamine </p>

<p> are also unavailable.) </p>

<p> Reporting from DAWN shows that the estimated number of
metropolitan area </p>

<p> methamphetamine-related emergency room episodes decreased at
a </p>

<p> relatively steady rate from the first half of FY 1989 through
the first </p>

<p> half of FY 1992. However, this downward trend reversed itself
during the </p>

<p> latter half of FY 1992. During the second half of FY 1992,
there was a </p>

<p> 52-percent increase in the number of emergency room episodes
involving </p>

<p> methamphetamine. Despite this, second-half FY 1992 emergency
room </p>

<p> episodes remained below those reported in FY 1989. </p>

<p> DAWN emergency room data indicate that methamphetamine abuse
is </p>

<p> concentrated in the metropolitan areas of San Diego, San
Francisco, and </p>

<p> Los Angeles In San Diego and Los Angeles,
methamphetamine-related </p>

<p> hospital emergencies increased sharply during the latter half
of 1992. </p>

<p> Nationally, approximately 75 percent of the patients treated
for drug </p>

<p> abuse episodes involving methamphetamine were white; nearly
65 percent </p>

<p> were male; approximately 25 percent were between 18 and 25
years of age, </p>

<p> and 40 percent were between the ages of 26 and 34. </p>

<p> Approximately 45 percent of patients treated in emergency
rooms as a </p>

<p> result of methamphetamine abuse indicated that their use of </p>

<p> methamphetamine was due to dependence. Approximately 20
percent had come </p>

<p> to the emergency room because of an overdose, approximately
30 percent </p>

<p> as a result of an unexpected reaction to the drug, and more
than 20 </p>

<p> percent came due to the chronic effects associated with
methamphetamine </p>

<p> abuse. </p>

<p> Reporting from DAWN also indicates that the injection of
methamphetamine </p>

<p> continues to be the predominant route of administration used
by patients </p>

<p> admitted to DAWN emergency rooms for methamphetamine-related
problems. </p>

<p> Despite this, the percentage of patients who indicated that
injection </p>

<p> was their primary method of administration decreased slightly
during the </p>

<p> past year from 38.4 percent in FY 1991 to 34.9 percent in FY
1992. </p>

<p> Moreover, there has been an increase in the percentage of
patients who </p>

<p> smoked methamphetamine during the past several years. Those
who smoked </p>

<p> methamphetamine increased from 3.9 percent during FY 1989 to
6.8 percent </p>

<p> during FY 1992. </p>

<p> ILLICIT MANUFACTURE </p>

<p> Laboratory Seizures </p>

<p> Although clandestine methamphetamine laboratory seizures
declined during </p>

<p> 1992, methamphetamine remained the most prevalent,
clandestinely </p>

<p> manufactured controlled substance in the United States.
According to DEA </p>

<p> reporting, 288 methamphetamine laboratories were seized
during 1992, </p>

<p> which accounted for 87 percent of all clandestine dangerous
drug </p>

<p> laboratory seizures. The 1992 figure represents a nine
percent decrease </p>

<p> from the previous year's total of 315 laboratories seized and
continues </p>

<p> the downward trend in laboratory seizures that began in 1990.
</p>

<p> DEA field divisions in Dallas, Denver, Los Angeles, Phoenix,
San Diego, </p>

<p> San Francisco, and Seattle, seized approximately 83 percent
of all </p>

<p> methamphetamine laboratories during 1992. This clearly
indicates that </p>

<p> the clandestine manufacture of methamphetamine is still
primarily based </p>

<p> in the western and southwestern United States. </p>

<p> Methamphetamine laboratory seizures declined from 1991 to
1992 in 14 DEA </p>

<p> field divisions including the San Francisco Division which
continued to </p>

<p> report the highest number of seizures. Sixty-seven
clandestine </p>

<p> methamphetamine laboratories were seized during 1992 by the
San </p>

<p> Francisco Division compared to 81 in 1991. However, DEA's Los
Angeles, </p>

<p> San Diego, Phoenix, Dallas, and St. Louis offices reported an
increase </p>

<p> in the number of laboratories seized within their respective
areas. </p>

<p> Clandestine laboratories have been seized from every
imaginable location </p>

<p> from suburban homes, garages, apartments, mobile trailers,
urban </p>

<p> dwellings, and industrial areas to specially-designed
underground </p>

<p> vaults. The laboratories have been camouflaged,
booby-trapped, buried </p>

<p> underground, conveyed, and abandoned. </p>

<p> Laboratory Operations </p>

<p> Laboratories are usually constructed in very rural areas
across the </p>

<p> United States; however, an increasing number of small
laboratories are </p>

<p> being located in urban and suburban neighborhoods where they
pose a </p>

<p> significant threat to health and safety. Not only are
methamphetamine </p>

<p> laboratories used to produce an illegal, often deadly drug,
but they </p>

<p> have caused explosions, fires, and toxic fumes. Chemicals
associated </p>

<p> with clandestine laboratories have proven to be environmental
pollutants </p>

<p> and health hazards. </p>

<p> Clandestine laboratories are usually operated on an irregular
basis </p>

<p> rather than on a regular schedule. Operators often produce a
batch of </p>

<p> methamphetamine then disassemble the laboratory and store it
or move it </p>

<p> to another location while they acquire additional chemicals.
Storage </p>

<p> facilities are often utilized to house (safeguard) chemicals,
glassware, </p>

<p> and the finished product. An operator will often utilize
different </p>

<p> locations to manufacture methamphetamine. Therefore, it is
not uncommon </p>

<p> for an organization to have multiple laboratory sites.
Relocating the </p>

<p> laboratory affords some protection against detection by law
enforcement </p>

<p> authorities. </p>

<p> Clandestine laboratory operators are often well-armed, and
their </p>

<p> laboratories are occasionally booby-trapped as a security
precaution. </p>

<p> Numerous weapons, including explosives, are routinely
confiscated in </p>

<p> conjunction with clandestine laboratory seizures. Public
safety, and </p>

<p> environmental concerns are of little importance to illicit
drug </p>

<p> laboratory operators. Every year, a number of clandestine
laboratories </p>

<p> experience fires or explosions which lead to their discovery.
Laboratory </p>

<p> operators often waste essential chemicals as they attempt to
synthesize </p>

<p> a high-quality batch of finished product. They usually
dispose of these </p>

<p> and other hazardous chemical wastes by unsafe and illegal
methods, often </p>

<p> dumping these wastes on the ground or in nearby streams and
lakes, </p>

<p> pouring them into local sewage systems, or burying them
underground. </p>

<p> Individuals who synthesize methamphetamine are commonly
referred to as </p>

<p> &quot;chemists&quot; or &quot;cooks.&quot; This level of
education and knowledge of </p>

<p> chemistry can vary from high school dropouts with no real
chemical </p>

<p> knowledge to professional chemists with graduate degrees in
chemistry. </p>

<p> These &quot;cooks&quot; most typically have very little
formal training; rather, </p>

<p> they frequently follow a handwritten recipe or have learned
to </p>

<p> synthesize methamphetamine from underground publications, </p>

<p> apprenticeships, or during incarceration. There are, however,
a number </p>

<p> of &quot;chemists&quot; that are fairly adept or
knowledgeable with regard to </p>

<p> synthesizing methamphetamine. These individuals utilize
chemicals more </p>

<p> efficiently, thus increasing the yield ratio of chemicals to
finished </p>

<p> product. In addition, the &quot;chemist&quot; has the
proficiency to solve </p>

<p> problems which may occur during the manufacturing process.
This is in </p>

<p> contrast to operators who simply follow a recipe and who are
generally </p>

<p> unqualified to perform corrective measures. </p>

<p> MANUFACTURING METHODOLOGIES </p>

<p> Although the manufacture of methamphetamine can be
accomplished by a </p>

<p> variety of chemical synthesis methods, it is most commonly
produced </p>

<p> using the phenyl-2-propanone (P2P) or ephedrine reduction
routes of </p>

<p> synthesis. The ephedrine reduction method was once most often
used in </p>

<p> clandestine laboratories located in California, and has since
become </p>

<p> widespread throughout much of the United States. It is
preferred over </p>

<p> the P2P method of methamphetamine production for three
reasons. First, </p>

<p> it is a simpler route of synthesis; second, the effects of
the resulting </p>

<p> product are more pronounced; and, third, ephedrine is more
readily </p>

<p> available to clandestine laboratories in California and in
the </p>

<p> Southwest. </p>

<p> A relatively new and simple procedure to synthesize
methamphetamine has </p>

<p> been noted using a variation of the ephedrine reduction
method. The </p>

<p> process is being called a &quot;cold cook&quot; method on the
streets because an </p>

<p> external heat source is not required for the synthesis to
proceed. The </p>

<p> method uses commonly available material and chemicals to
manufacture </p>

<p> between one to two ounces of methamphetamine per batch. The
process is </p>

<p> commonly performed in such readily available containers as
two 32-ounce </p>

<p> sports drinking bottles, insulated coffee cups, mugs, or in
modified </p>

<p> laboratory glassware. </p>

<p> CHEMICAL DIVERSION </p>

<p> Integral to the manufacture of illicit methamphetamine are
the chemicals </p>

<p> and equipment necessary to operate a clandestine laboratory.
Whether the </p>

<p> phenyl-2-propanone, ephedrine reduction, or other method of
synthesis is </p>

<p> used, various combinations of chemicals, glassware, and
equipment are </p>

<p> required. The acquisition of chemicals is, therefore, a vital
and </p>

<p> readily identifiable component of the illicit trafficking
cycle. </p>

<p> Chemical control legislation enacted at the Federal and State
level has </p>

<p> made it increasingly difficult for operators to obtain needed
chemicals. </p>

<p> Consequently, trafficking organizations are constantly
seeking new </p>

<p> sources and developing ways in which to circumvent the law.
They </p>

<p> manufacture some of their own chemicals, utilize
&quot;runners&quot; to purchase </p>

<p> necessary chemicals under threshold amounts, and experiment
with </p>

<p> alternate, non-regulated chemicals. Laboratory operators
obtain </p>

<p> regulated chemicals, such as ephedrine, by purchasing
over-the-counter </p>

<p> products which are exempt from the provisions of the CDTA.
Chemicals are </p>

<p> also acquired from &quot;rogue&quot; chemical companies or in
States which have </p>

<p> less restrictive chemical laws or in such countries as Mexico
and </p>

<p> Canada. </p>

<p> MANUFACTURlNG/DISTRIBUTION ORGANIZATIONS </p>

<p> Methamphetamine manufacturing/distribution operations vary
greatly in </p>

<p> size, structure, and degree of sophistication. Some
laboratory operators </p>

<p> act as their own chemists; others hire chemists to run the
laboratories </p>

<p> for them. Many manufacturers are independent producers who
cook for </p>

<p> various organized groups. This is particularly true of larger
</p>

<p> organizations which may hire or contract chemists to
manufacture </p>

<p> methamphetamine in return for cash, finished product, or a
combination </p>

<p> of the two. Other cooks manufacture for themselves rather
than for a </p>

<p> particular organization. Leasing storage facilities,
procuring </p>

<p> chemicals, securing the laboratory site, and setting up
glassware and </p>

<p> equipment may be the responsibility of one person or many
different </p>

<p> individuals. Several individuals may simply work together to
combine </p>

<p> their expertise, chemicals, etc., on an ad hoc basis. The
number of </p>

<p> individuals which comprise an operation and the function each
performs </p>

<p> differs from one organization to the next. </p>

<p> Throughout the United States, numerous individuals, groups,
and </p>

<p> organizations from independent entrepreneurs and outlaw
motorcycle gangs </p>

<p> to Mexican poly-drug trafficking organizations currently
manufacture and </p>

<p> distribute methamphetamine. Nationally, independent
entrepreneurs </p>

<p> represent the largest identifiable group involved in
methamphetamine- </p>

<p> related investigations. To a lesser degree, outlaw motorcycle
gangs </p>

<p> continue to play a role in the distribution aspect and
influence </p>

<p> production in certain areas. They most typically insulate
themselves by </p>

<p> financing manufacturing operations rather than becoming
directly </p>

<p> involved themselves. </p>

<p> The most noteworthy trend in recent years is currently taking
place in </p>

<p> California where Mexican traffickers dominate the large-scale
production </p>

<p> and distribution of methamphetamine in the San Diego,
Riverside, San </p>

<p> Bernadino, and Fresno areas. In fact, the high volume of
methamphetamine </p>

<p> manufactured and distributed is the distinguishing
characteristic of </p>

<p> Mexican traffickers involved in dangerous drug production. </p>

<p> Numerous 22-liter setups are frequently utilized in
laboratories </p>

<p> operated by Mexican traffickers to produce an average of 20
to 80 pounds </p>

<p> during each manufacturing process. Traffickers set up
laboratories or </p>

<p> &quot;cooks&quot; in very remote areas throughout southern
and parts of northern </p>

<p> California Organizations may purchase property or pay for the
short-term </p>

<p> use of a site in order to acquire a secure manufacturing
location. An </p>

<p> organization may utilize one location multiple times. </p>

<p> Mexican illegal aliens are most frequently encountered at
these </p>

<p> laboratory sites. In some cases, they are hired as helpers or
to </p>

<p> maintain the reaction process, while the actual chemist
visits </p>

<p> periodically to ensure the operation is functioning properly.
In other </p>

<p> cases, Mexican illegal aliens are responsible for all facets
of the </p>

<p> manufacturing process. Chemicals are generally stored in
stash houses </p>

<p> and brought to the laboratory site on a limited basis. The
amount of </p>

<p> chemicals present at the laboratory is usually restricted to
what is </p>

<p> required to complete a particular cook. </p>

<p> Chemicals are procured for these laboratories from sources in
the United </p>

<p> States and Mexico. Chemical brokers recruit runners to make
purchases at </p>

<p> rogue chemical companies. Additionally, ephedrine, a
precursor for </p>

<p> methamphetamine, is easily accessible to Mexican traffickers;
the </p>

<p> chemical is currently shipped, without restriction, from
Germany to </p>

<p> Mexico and subsequently smuggled across the United
States-Mexican border </p>

<p> in privately owned vehicles. Moreover, brokers supply
chemicals to </p>

<p> numerous manufacturing organizations. Organizations assist
each other in </p>

<p> obtaining chemicals and glassware. A certain amount of
cooperation </p>

<p> exists among many of these organizations; links between these
groups </p>

<p> were already established through their long-standing cocaine,
heroin, </p>

<p> and marijuana connections. </p>

<p> There are indications that groups which previously
manufactured </p>

<p> methamphetamine are now finding it more cost effective to
purchase it </p>

<p> from Mexican sources. In addition, there is limited evidence
to suggest </p>

<p> that Mexican traffickers may be attempting to expand their
operations to </p>

<p> other areas of the country. There are also indications that </p>

<p> methamphetamine is currently being manufactured in Mexico and
</p>

<p> subsequently smuggled into the United States. </p>

<p> SOURCE AREAS </p>

<p> California is a primary source for methamphetamine in many
areas </p>

<p> throughout the United States. However, the manner in which
manufacturing </p>

<p> operations are carried out often makes it difficult to
determine the </p>

<p> origin of the source of supply. Operators manufacturing in a
particular </p>

<p> area may distribute the finished product to associates
residing locally, </p>

<p> in neighboring States, or in other geographic areas.
Privately owned </p>

<p> vehicles are the modes of transportation used most frequently
in the </p>

<p> nationwide distribution of methamphetamine. </p>

<p> LSD </p>

<p> AVAILABILITY/PRICE/POTENCY </p>

<p> DEA reporting indicates that LSD (Iysergic acid diethylamide)
is </p>

<p> available in at least retail quantities in virtually every
State in the </p>

<p> United States and that availability is increasing in a number
of States. </p>

<p> Reporting also indicates that an increasing number of
individuals or </p>

<p> groups are manufacturing and distributing or attempting to
manufacture </p>

<p> and distribute LSD in the United States. In the last two
years, DEA </p>

<p> seized or purchased LSD in 33 States and Washington, D.C. LSD
</p>

<p> availability has been reported by either DEA offices or State
and local </p>

<p> police authorities in many of the remaining 17 States.
Northern </p>

<p> California appears to be the source of supply for most of the
LSD </p>

<p> available in the United States. </p>

<p> LSD is available in several forms, including blotter paper,
tablets, </p>

<p> gelatin, sugar cubes, and liquid. Tablets can be purchased in
several </p>

<p> areas, however, most of the retail doses are in the
blotter-paper form. </p>

<p> Microdots are available in California, Illinois, Indiana,
Michigan, New </p>

<p> Jersey, and Vermont. Gelatin in the &quot;windowpane&quot;
variety has been </p>

<p> reported in Michigan and sugar cubes are available in
Colorado and the </p>

<p> Washington, D.C., area. Personal-use doses of liquid LSD in
vials have </p>

<p> also been reported in Colorado, Illinois, New York, and West
Virginia. </p>

<p> LSD is relatively inexpensive. The average price is
approximately five </p>

<p> dollars per retail dosage unit and costs less than one dollar
per dosage </p>

<p> unit in wholesale lots of 1,000 dosage units or more. When
compared with </p>

<p> marijuana, which sells for $40 to $450 per ounce, LSD is
perceived by </p>

<p> many drug users as a bargain, especially if one considers the
duration </p>

<p> of its effects which can persist for up to 12 hours in higher
doses. </p>

<p> Although there has been some fluctuation in the price of LSD
nationally </p>

<p> during the past several years, overall prices remain
relatively low. </p>

<p> LSD potency or strength is measured in micrograms. In the
1960's and </p>

<p> early 1970's, LSD potency generally ranged from 100 to 200
micrograms </p>

<p> per dosage unit or higher. Analysis of exhibits during the
late 1970's </p>

<p> indicated an average potency in the 30- to 50-microgram
range. From the </p>

<p> mid-1980's to the present, LSD potency has remained
considerably below </p>

<p> levels reported during the 1960's and early 1970's and has
generally </p>

<p> been in the range of 20 to 80 micrograms per dosage unit. As
a result of </p>

<p> this comparatively low dosage level, many users perceive LSD
as &quot;safe,&quot; </p>

<p> thus enhancing the drug's attractiveness. </p>

<p> USE </p>

<p> The National Household Survey on Drug Abuse data for LSD are
limited to </p>

<p> estimates of lifetime use, defined as the use of LSD at least
once in a </p>

<p> person's lifetime. During 1991, 11.8 million Americans, 12
years of age </p>

<p> and older, reported having used LSD at least once compared to
8.4 </p>

<p> million in 1985, an increase of 40 percent. The data reveal
two </p>

<p> significant expansions in the number of lifetime users of
LSD; one </p>

<p> expansion occurred from 1985 to 1988 and the other from 1990
to 1991. </p>

<p> According to the 1992 National High School Survey on Drug
Abuse, past </p>

<p> year use of LSD among seniors in the class of 1992 increased
to the </p>

<p> highest level since at least 1985. Current (monthly) use of
LSD among </p>

<p> 10th and 12th grade students remained relatively stable from
1991 to </p>

<p> 1992. Among 8th graders, however, current use of LSD
increased during </p>

<p> that same time frame from 0.6 percent to 0.9 percent.
Moreover, past- </p>

<p> year use of LSD rose in all three grade levels from 1991 to
1992. </p>

<p> DAWN reports indicate that the estimated number of nationwide
LSD- </p>

<p> related hospital emergency room episodes increased from FY
1989 to FY </p>

<p> 1990. Although abuse patterns have been somewhat erratic
since that </p>

<p> period, the current number of LSD-related episodes remain
above those </p>

<p> reported during FY 1989. </p>

<p> ILLICIT MANUFACTURE AND TRAFFICKING </p>

<p> A total of six clandestine synthesis LSD laboratories have
been seized </p>

<p> since 1981; however, these were all seized prior to 1987. </p>

<p> LSD producers fall into two groups. The first is composed of
chemists, </p>

<p> manufacturers, and distributors, located in northern
California, who </p>

<p> work together in close association; they are normally major </p>

<p> manufacturers capable of distributing LSD nationwide. The
second group </p>

<p> of producers work independently. The independent producers
are </p>

<p> encountered in almost any part of the country, however, their
product is </p>

<p> intended for local consumption only. </p>

<p> Wholesale LSD trafficking patterns are not well understood;
however, </p>

<p> three theoretical models have been developed, which outline </p>

<p> organizational structures, production methods, and
trafficking patterns. </p>

<p> These theoretical models may help to explain how clandestine
LSD </p>

<p> activity occurs. Law enforcement officials call these
organizational </p>

<p> patterns: the Independent Entrepreneurial Model, the
Inner/Outer Circle </p>

<p> Group Model, and the Association Model. </p>

<p> The Independent Entrepreneurial Model: A number of law
enforcement </p>

<p> officials believe some LSD manufacturers and distributors,
who are not </p>

<p> part of the northern California group, entered the market due
to </p>

<p> increased demand and the opportunity for high returns on a
small </p>

<p> investment. Examples of this type of loosely-structured
organization </p>

<p> have been noted in cases in Austin, Texas; New Orleans,
Louisiana; </p>

<p> Hartford, Connecticut; and Denver and Boulder, Colorado. The
common </p>

<p> feature in each of these cases was an individual or a small
group of </p>

<p> individuals who manufactured LSD independently from any
California </p>

<p> source of supply. Some entrepreneurs who have manufactured or
have </p>

<p> attempted to manufacture LSD have been known to law
enforcement </p>

<p> officials for years; however, the number of independent
traffickers </p>

<p> appears to have increased recently. </p>

<p> The Inner Circle/Outer Circle or Single Group Model: This
model is </p>

<p> thought to be organized under one close-knit group, the inner
circle, </p>

<p> which controls the vast majority of LSD manufacturing and
distribution </p>

<p> in the United States. The inner circle is probably composed
of five to </p>

<p> 10 principal individuals who possess specialized functions.
These </p>

<p> specialists would include chemists, bulk storage custodians, </p>

<p> financial/transportation specialists, and executives who
manage overall </p>

<p> operations. The inner circle controls the means of
manufacture; they </p>

<p> assemble, operate, disassemble, and store laboratory
equipment; and keep </p>

<p> a reserve amount of LSD on hand for distribution. They sell
from 10- to </p>

<p> 200-gram lots to a limited number of multigram distributors.
This inner </p>

<p> circle presumably accrues multimillion-dollar profits and
only conducts </p>

<p> business with the next level of distribution referred to as
the &quot;outer </p>

<p> circle.&quot; </p>

<p> The outer circle consists of multigram distributors who
supply a number </p>

<p> of teams, groups, or individuals. They sell LSD at $1,000 to
$3,000 per </p>

<p> gram and accrue an estimated $300,000 to $600,000 per year. </p>

<p> Close Association Model (An alternative theory to the Inner
Circle/Outer </p>

<p> Circle or Single Group Model): In this model, a small group
of people </p>

<p> located in northern California, who have known each other for
over two </p>

<p> decades, control the manufacture and distribution of LSD.
However, in </p>

<p> contrast with the Inner Circle/Outer Circle theory, these
people do not </p>

<p> work in one structured organization. They come together, as
necessary, </p>

<p> to acquire chemists, chemicals, working capital, etc. They
work as </p>

<p> consultants or advisors to each other in order to meet their
common goal </p>

<p> of producing and distributing LSD. They may work together as
a unit to </p>

<p> prepare and distribute one batch of LSD, but after that is
accomplished, </p>

<p> they leave the association until another opportunity arises.
They have </p>

<p> strong loyalty to each other and are living comfortably, but
they are </p>

<p> not thought to be motivated primarily by profit. </p>

<p> DISTRIBUTION </p>

<p> Lower-level distribution of LSD usually occurs in three ways.
First, an </p>

<p> individual attends a rock concert, meets a source of supply,
and </p>

<p> exchanges telephone numbers with the source of supply.
Normally, these </p>

<p> purchases are for retail quantities of up to 100 doses.
Second, if this </p>

<p> individual decides to continue distributing, he/she would
then call the </p>

<p> source for additional amounts. Usually the source has either
continued </p>

<p> on the concert tour or has returned home, which is frequently
northern </p>

<p> California. If the source intends to stay on the tour-making
subsequent </p>

<p> communication difficult-the source provides the telephone
number of an </p>

<p> associate for future orders. After the initial purchase,
almost all </p>

<p> transactions are made via the public and private mail
systems. Payments </p>

<p> to a source of supply are usually made through legitimate
money wiring </p>

<p> services. Third, some dealers travel directly to California
to meet </p>

<p> their sources of supply. </p>

<p> Reporting indicates that shipment methods used to transport
both large </p>

<p> and small quantities of LSD are often similar. LSD is
frequently </p>

<p> concealed in greeting cards, in cassette tapes, or in
articles of </p>

<p> clothing that are mailed to a post office box established by
the </p>

<p> recipient. This post office box is usually listed under a
fictitious </p>

<p> name or business. Normally, no return address is provided on
the package </p>

<p> or envelope. Moreover, it is suspected that some multigram
distributors </p>

<p> will travel to their source in order to obtain supplies. </p>

<p> Retail or user level quantities range from one- to 10-dosage
units. Low- </p>

<p> level distributors sell 50- to 100-dosage-unit quantities.
Mid-level </p>

<p> distributors sell 1,000-dosage-unit quantities as well as
multiples of </p>

<p> 1,000 units. These distributors normally have more than one
source of </p>

<p> supply and sell to several lower-level dealers. The sources
of supply </p>

<p> for gram-distributors are in all likelihood located in
northern </p>

<p> California. These sources normally convert LSD from powder or
liquid </p>

<p> form to blotter form. Multigram distributors travel to
California to </p>

<p> obtain LSD personally and are in association with numerous
lower-level </p>

<p> dealers. </p>

<p> PCP </p>

<p> AVAILABILITY/PRICE </p>

<p> Phencyclidine, commonly referred to as PCP, is available in
varying </p>

<p> degrees in a limited number of U.S. cities, primarily
Baltimore, </p>

<p> Chicago, Los Angeles, New York City, Philadelphia, San
Francisco, and </p>

<p> Washington, D.C. During 1992, PCP in liquid form, the most
common form </p>

<p> available in the United States, sold for $150 to $1,000 per
ounce </p>

<p> nationally. The lowest liquid-ounce prices were reported in
Los Angeles, </p>

<p> the source for most of the PCP trafficked in the United
States, where </p>

<p> such quantities sold for $150 to $300. Nationwide, the price
for PCP in </p>

<p> powdered form ranged from $400 to $2,000 per ounce. During
1992, the </p>

<p> price for a gallon of PCP ranged from $3,000 to $10,000 in
Los Angeles </p>

<p> and up to $13,000 in New York City. Individual cigarettes
saturated with </p>

<p> PCP sold for between $5 dollars and $70 nationwide. </p>

<p> USE </p>

<p> PCP is sold on the street under numerous names including:
Angel Dust, </p>

<p> Crystal, Supergrass, Killer Joints, Ozone, Wack, Embalming
Fluid, and </p>

<p> Rocket Fuel. These names reflect the range of its bizarre and
volatile </p>

<p> effects. The liquid form of PCP is the most commonly
encountered, but it </p>

<p> is also sold in tablets, capsules, and as a powder. PCP is
typically </p>

<p> applied to a leafy material such as mint, parsley, oregano,
or </p>

<p> marijuana, and then smoked. PCP has been used to adulterate </p>

<p> commercially-manufactured cigarettes, usually by dipping them
in liquid </p>

<p> PCP, which is PCP dissolved in ether. The most popular
commercial </p>

<p> cigarettes are dark paper-wrapped brands such as Shermans or
Tijuana </p>

<p> Smalls. PCP can also be injected hypodermically into
cigarettes. </p>

<p> In 1957, PCP was developed as a human anesthetic and later
used in </p>

<p> veterinary medicine as a powerful tranquilizer. In 1965,
medical use for </p>

<p> humans was discontinued because of adverse side effects such
as </p>

<p> confusion and delirium. In 1978, its commercial manufacture
was </p>

<p> discontinued and PCP was transferred from Schedule III to
Schedule II of </p>

<p> the Controlled Substances Act, thus classifying it as a drug
with a high </p>

<p> potential for abuse. </p>

<p> PCP enjoyed a brief popularity in the late 1960's when it was
trafficked </p>

<p> as a &quot;Magic Peace Pill.&quot; Abuse of the drug
resurfaced from the mid-to- </p>

<p> late 1970's because of low price and powerful effects. From
the period </p>

<p> 1981 through 1985, abuse of the drug escalated significantly,
</p>

<p> particularly among persons under the age of 21. Cities which
experienced </p>

<p> significant PCP availability and abuse levels in the
early-to-mid-1980's </p>

<p> included Baltimore, Chicago, Detroit, Los Angeles, New
Orleans, New York </p>

<p> City, San Diego, San Francisco, St. Louis, and Washington,
D.C. </p>

<p> Around 1986, and continuing through the early 1990's, demand
for PCP was </p>

<p> displaced in large measure by the widespread availability and
use of </p>

<p> crack cocaine. More recently, however, there are indications
that PCP </p>

<p> abuse is increasing once again in a number of cities. </p>

<p> The National Household Survey on Drug Abuse showed that
lifetime and </p>

<p> past-year PCP use among the U.S. household population
decreased from </p>

<p> 1985 to 1990; however, 1991 and 1992 survey data indicate an
end to this </p>

<p> downward use pattern. From 1990 to 1992, the number of
Americans aged 12 </p>

<p> years and older, who used PCP at least once, increased from
six million </p>

<p> to 8.2 million, while the number who had used PCP in the past
year </p>

<p> increased from 307,000 to 467,000. Nevertheless, the number
of past-year </p>

<p> users in 1992 remained significantly below the number
reported in 1985 </p>

<p> when approximately 1.2 million Americans reported using PCP
at least </p>

<p> once yearly. </p>

<p> According to the 1992 National High School Senior Survey on
Drug Abuse, </p>

<p> PCP use among 12th graders has declined significantly during
the past </p>

<p> seven years. From 1985 to 1992, the percentage of seniors who
used PCP </p>

<p> at least once in their lifetime decreased from 4.9 percent to
2.4 </p>

<p> percent. Comparable declines were also reported during that
same period </p>

<p> in the percentage of seniors who used PCP during the past
year and past </p>

<p> month as well as on a daily basis. This diminished use is
believed to be </p>

<p> due in large part to a significant increase among 12th
graders in the </p>

<p> perceived risk of harm associated with PCP usage. </p>

<p> Reporting from DAWN shows that the estimated number of
metropolitan-area </p>

<p> PCP-related emergency room episodes, which had been declining
at a </p>

<p> substantial rate during the past three years, rose from 1,353
during the </p>

<p> first half of FY 1992 to 2,380 during the second half of FY
1992, more </p>

<p> than a 75-percent increase. Cities having high or increased
PCP abuse </p>

<p> rates during the second half of FY 1992 included Baltimore,
Chicago, Los </p>

<p> Angeles, New York City, Philadelphia, San Francisco, and
Washington, </p>

<p> D.C. </p>

<p> TRAFFICKING AND ILLICIT MANUFACTURE </p>

<p> Reporting indicates that the majority of the nation's PCP
supply is </p>

<p> manufactured and distributed by Los Angeles-based street
gangs. While </p>

<p> buses, trains, and airlines are used to transport PCP from
California </p>

<p> sources of supply, private automobiles are believed to be the
primary </p>

<p> means for transporting PCP across the country. Female
couriers are used </p>

<p> very frequently and the amounts transported generally range
from one to </p>

<p> two quarts. PCP traffickers also use the U.S. mail system and
express </p>

<p> delivery services to transport PCP. </p>

<p> Four PCP laboratories were seized in 1992 compared to three
in 1991. Two </p>

<p> of the 1992 seizures were in northern California and one each
near </p>

<p> Chicago and Philadelphia. PCP laboratory seizures since the
mid-1980's </p>

<p> have ranged from three to 21 per year, totals which are
considerably </p>

<p> less than the high of 79 reported in 1978. No PCP
laboratories have been </p>

<p> seized thus far in 1993. </p>

<p> APPENDIX </p>

<p> The NATIONAL HOUSEHOLD SURVEY ON DRUG ABUSE, sponsored by the
Substance </p>

<p> Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), is
a series of </p>

<p> national surveys to measure the prevalence and frequency of
drug use </p>

<p> among the U.S. household population aged 12 and over. The
survey samples </p>

<p> the civilian non-institutionalized population living in
households, </p>

<p> college dormitories, and military installations and,
therefore, does not </p>

<p> include some segments of the U.S. population which may
contain a </p>

<p> substantial proportion of drug users, such as transients and
those who </p>

<p> are incarcerated. The SAMHSA publishes survey results on an
annual </p>

<p> basis. </p>

<p> The NATIONAL HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR SURVEY is a series of
nationwide studies </p>

<p> of drug use frequency and related attitudes among high school
seniors in </p>

<p> the United States. The survey is conducted annually by the
University of </p>

<p> Michigan's Institute for Social Research and funded by
research grants </p>

<p> from the SAMHSA. In addition to high school seniors, the
study includes </p>

<p> the recently-added national surveys of 8th and 10th grade
students. For </p>

<p> the 1992 survey, approximately 50,000 8th-, 10th-, and
12th-grade </p>

<p> students across the country were questioned. </p>

<p> The DRUG ABUSE WARNING NETWORK (DAWN) is a large-scale data
collection </p>

<p> system implemented in 1972 and designed to be an indicator of
the </p>

<p> severity, scope, and nature of the nation's substance abuse
problem. The </p>

<p> purpose of DAWN is to provide data on the incidence of drug
abuse </p>

<p> related episodes from participating hospital emergency rooms
located in </p>

<p> 21 U.S. metropolitan areas. DAWN is managed by the SAMHSA. </p>

<p> The NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF JUSTICE (NIJ) established the Drug
Use </p>

<p> Forecasting Program (DUF) in 1987 to identify and monitor
trends in drug </p>

<p> use among arrestees in the United States. Each quarter, at
central </p>

<p> booking facilities in 24 participating jurisdictions,
arrestees are </p>

<p> asked to participate in a voluntary, anonymous interview and
to provide </p>

<p> a urine specimen. Urine samples are analyzed to detect the
use of </p>

<p> cocaine, opiates, marijuana, PCP, methadone, benzodiazines
(such as </p>

<p> Valium), methaqualone, propoxyphene (such as Darvon),
barbiturates, and </p>

<p> amphetamines. The results of the urinalysis testing are
published by the </p>

<p> NIJ on a quarterly and annual basis. </p>

<p>COCA CULTIVATION AND COCAINE PROCESSING: </p>

<p>AN OVERVIEW </p>

<p>DRUG ENFORCEMENT ADMINISTRATION </p>

<p>INTELLIGENCE DIVISION </p>

<p>STRATEGIC INTELLIGENCE SECTION </p>

<p>SEPTEMBER 1993 </p>

<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY </p>

<p>Two of the lesser understood aspects of the illicit cocaine
traffic are the </p>

<p>cultivation of the coca plant and the conversion of the coca
leaf into </p>

<p>cocaine hydrochloride (HCl). While the coca plant can be found
throughout </p>

<p>most of Latin America, varieties containing the cocaine
alkaloid (the basis </p>

<p>for cocaine HCl) are cultivated and converted primarily in
Peru, Bolivia and </p>

<p>Colombia. </p>

<p>There are two different species and several different
varieties of coca </p>

<p>plants which contain the cocaine alkaloid and these varieties
prosper under </p>

<p>quite different climatic conditions. At the same time, the
methods used to </p>

<p>cultivate and harvest coca leaf differ depending on
climate,tradition,and </p>

<p>other factors. The conversion of coca leaf into coca paste,
cocaine base, and </p>

<p>cocaine hydrochloride is also a varied process with many steps
involved and </p>

<p>many chemicals necessary. </p>

<p>THE COCA PLANT </p>

<p>It has been estimated that there are over 200 Erythroxylum
species growing in </p>

<p>the Western Hemisphere. Only 17 species can be utilized to
produce cocaine. </p>

<p>Fifteen of the 17 species contain relatively low levels of
cocaine alkaloid </p>

<p>and subsequently are not cultivated. In South America two
species and two </p>

<p>varieties within each of these species are cultivated. They
are: </p>

<p>--E. coca Species </p>

<p>var. coca </p>

<p>var. ipadu </p>

<p>--E. novogranatense Species </p>

<p>var. novogranatense </p>

<p>var. truxillense </p>

<p>These varieties are traditionally cultivated in the following
areas: </p>

<p>--Bolivia </p>

<p>E. coca var. coca </p>

<p>--Peru </p>

<p>E. coca var. coca </p>

<p>E. novogranatense var. truxillense </p>

<p>E. coca var. ipadu </p>

<p>--Colombia </p>

<p>E. novogranatense var. novogranatense </p>

<p>E. coca var. ipadu </p>

<p>E. novogranatense var. truxillense </p>

<p>The most widely grown variety of coca is E. coca var. coca
which is </p>

<p>cultivated on the eastern slope of the Andes from Bolivia in
the south to as </p>

<p>far north as central Ecuador. This area of the Andes has a
tropical climate </p>

<p>and experiences high amounts of rainfall. Coca in this region
is usually </p>

<p>grown between 1,650 and 4,950 feet in elevation. </p>

<p>E. novogranatense var. novogranatense thrives in the drier
regions of </p>

<p>Colombia and, to a lesser extent, Venezuela. It is also grown
at lower </p>

<p>elevations where the climate is generally hotter. The main
variety of </p>

<p>E.novogranatense, var. truxillense, is grown up to an
elevation of 4,950 </p>

<p>feet. The last variety, E. coca var. ipadu, is found in
southern Colombia, </p>

<p>northeastern Peru, and western Brazil in the Amazon basin. E.
coca var. ipadu </p>

<p>is primarily cultivated by Indians for their own consumption
and is not as </p>

<p>high in cocaine alkaloids as the other three. </p>

<p>It is not an easy task, even for an expert, to readily
distinguish between </p>

<p>the different varieties of coca plants. One of the ways to
identify the </p>

<p>variety is to look at the leaves. Both varieties of E. coca
(E. coca var. </p>

<p>coca and E. coca var. ipadu) have broadly elliptic leaves. The
leaf of var. </p>

<p>ipadu has a rounded apex, whereas the apex of var. coca is
more pointed. The </p>

<p>leaf of var. coca is large, thick and dark green in color. </p>

<p>The leaf of E. novogranatense var. novogranatense is pale
green with a </p>

<p>rounded apex and is somewhat narrower and thinner than the
leaf of var. ipadu </p>

<p>and var.coca. E. novogranatense var. truxillense is very
similar to var. </p>

<p>novogranatense except that it does not possess the lines
parallel to the </p>

<p>central vein of the leaf that are characteristic to so many
varieties of coca </p>

<p>plant. </p>

<p>The cocaine alkaloid content of the E. coca and the E.
novogranatense species </p>

<p>also serves to distinguish between these species and the many
other species </p>

<p>of wild coca that grow in Latin America. These other species
contain much </p>

<p>lower levels of cocaine alkaloid. The usual cocaine alkaloid
content of a </p>

<p>sample of coca leaf material is between 0.1 and 0.8 percent.
The cocaine </p>

<p>alkaloid content can go much higher, however, as was shown in
one sample of </p>

<p>coca leaf from the Chapare region in Bolivia that measured 1.2
percent. Coca </p>

<p>grown on the upper slopes of the Andes also contain more
cocaine alkaloids </p>

<p>than coca grown in low-lying areas. It is therefore believed
that the best </p>

<p>quality coca is grown at higher altitudes. </p>

<p>CULTIVATION </p>

<p>While methods of cultivating the coca plant are similar in
many ways </p>

<p>throughout Peru, Bolivia, and Colombia, there are differences
in techniques </p>

<p>because of terrain, tradition, and other factors. </p>

<p>Some coca plantations have been in existence for years. In
other areas, </p>

<p>however, such as Peru's Upper Huauaga Valley, new plantations
are being </p>

<p>established daily. A typical farmer who is preparing a field
for coca will </p>

<p>usually pick an area that slopes slightly so that water will
not drown his </p>

<p>plants. He will then begin clearing his field, normally by
cutting trees and </p>

<p>stumps and setting fire to the debris, a clearing method known
as slash and </p>

<p>bum. The felled trees are left in the field and the coca is
simply planted </p>

<p>around them. The farmer has no motivation to move the logs
since there is no </p>

<p>market for the timber. Logs are absent from the older fields
because of rot </p>

<p>or because the farmer gradually cleared his field. </p>

<p>Once the field is cleared for cultivation, the farmer can
ready his crop for </p>

<p>planting. The first step in cultivation generally begins with
the seed. Seeds </p>

<p>are usually gathered from December through March from plants
ranging from two </p>

<p>to three years in age. They are often poured into water at the
onset to </p>

<p>identify bad seeds, which will usually float to the top and
are discarded. </p>

<p>The good seeds are planted in small plots that are kept shaded
from the sun. </p>

<p>Seeds are sown about two inches apart at a depth of
approximately one half </p>

<p>inch in humus enriched soil. These seedbeds are kept well
watered and weeded </p>

<p>frequently and the seeds will usually germinate within 20 to
30 days. </p>

<p>Sometimes the seeds are presoaked in water to hasten
germination which will </p>

<p>then occur in about ten days. </p>

<p>Seedlings usually reach transplanting size in about two
months. At this age </p>

<p>they are about 12 inches tall. While the measurements vary,
seedlings </p>

<p>generally are planted in holes about a foot deep and about one
and-one-half </p>

<p>feet from each other within rows about three feet apart. </p>

<p>Another popular method of establishing new fields of E. ipadu
involves taking </p>

<p>a cutting from an established coca bush and planting it in the
ground. This </p>

<p>method (cloning) is getting more popular as it gives the
farmer a head start. </p>

<p>There are two methods of planting a cutting. One involves
sticking several </p>

<p>branches a couple of feet long into the ground. The other
method is to cut </p>

<p>three or four inch cuttings from a branch, each one with
protruding smaller </p>

<p>branches. The cutting is soaked in water a day or so and then
planted in </p>

<p>loose, fertile soil. It is reported that coca leaf can be
harvested from </p>

<p>these plants within six months and seeds develop on these
plants after one </p>

<p>year but the seeds lack embryos and are not viable. </p>

<p>A coca plant cultivated from seed will generally reach full
maturity and its </p>

<p>leaves harvested between 12 and 24 months after being
transplanted. Even </p>

<p>though coca growing in the wild has been known to reach
heights of up to 30 </p>

<p>feet, that which is cultivated is almost always pruned back to
facilitate </p>

<p>harvesting the coca leaf. Cultivated fields are usually kept
at a height of </p>

<p>three to six feet. All picking of coca leaf is done by hand.
Harvesters have </p>

<p>to be very quick in their work yet careful not to damage the
leaf buds on the </p>

<p>bush while stripping off the leaves. Leaves are said to be
ready for harvest </p>

<p>when they take on a yellowish tint and have a tendency to
crack when bent. </p>

<p>Coca leaf can be harvested between two and six times per year
depending on </p>

<p>climatic conditions. Coca growing at lower altitudes will
usually be </p>

<p>harvested more often than coca growing at higher altitudes.
The most abundant </p>

<p>harvest, sometimes accounting for about half of the total
yearly harvest, </p>

<p>takes place after the rains in March. Subsequent harvests take
place in </p>

<p>June/July and November, the normal dry season in South
America. Some </p>

<p>harvesting, however, takes place all year round. </p>

<p>When the leaves are harvested, they are put in sacks and taken
to a closed </p>

<p>room and spread out on the floor. The next day, the leaves are
taken to a </p>

<p>flat area, where they are spread in thin layers on a tarpaulin
in direct </p>

<p>sunlight and left to dry. If there is a lot of sunshine and
minimal cloud </p>

<p>cover, the drying phase can be completed in six hours. During
inclement </p>

<p>weather, it takes much longer because at the first sign of
rain the leaves </p>

<p>are gathered up and taken into shelter. If a load of coca
leaves is caught by </p>

<p>a rainstorm during drying, it could ruin the whole load. This
is because the </p>

<p>leaves will ferment if the moisture goes over 14 percent. This
tends to cause </p>

<p>a breakdown of the cocaine alkaloids. </p>

<p>After the drying phase is completed, the coca leaves are swept
into large </p>

<p>piles and left for about three days before being taken to
market and/or </p>

<p>processing facilities. The weight of packaged leaves varies
from the 100 </p>

<p>pound &quot;carga&quot; in the Bolivian Chapare, to the 25
pound &quot;arroba&quot; in Peru's </p>

<p>Upper Huallaga Valley. In Colombia, coca leaves are not
usually sold; </p>

<p>however, when dried coca leaves are sold, it is usually in
packages of 25 </p>

<p>pounds. </p>

<p>Peru </p>

<p>Peru, the world's largest source of coca, has both licit and
illicit </p>

<p>cultivation. Licit coca is cultivation by farmers registered
with the </p>

<p>National Coca Monopoly (ENACO). ENACO buys and sells it to
retailers either </p>

<p>for resale domestically, for chewing or for herbal tea, or for
export to </p>

<p>produce soft drink flavoring or pharmaceuticals. The 18,000
hectares that </p>

<p>have been registered for licit coca cultivation are centered
in the </p>

<p>department of Cuzco. </p>

<p>Illicit coca cultivation occurs primarily in the Upper
Huallaga Valley region </p>

<p>of northern Peru including the departments of San Martin,
Huanuco, and </p>

<p>Ucayali. Other areas under cultivation include the valleys of
La Convencion </p>

<p>and Lares in the department of Cuzco, and the provinces of
Huanta and La Mar </p>

<p>along the Rio Apurimac in the department of Ayachucho. There
are also smaller </p>

<p>growing areas located in the departments of Puno and Pasco. </p>

<p>The Upper Huallaga Valley is a tropical area with a mild
climate that </p>

<p>receives an average of 12.44 feet of rain during the year.
June through </p>

<p>September is the dry season when the region gets very little
rainfall. The </p>

<p>mean annual temperature is 55 degrees Fahrenheit. Coca is
usually grown here </p>

<p>between 1,980 to 2,640 feet above sea level but is sometimes
planted up to </p>

<p>6,270 feet in altitude. The soil in the Upper Huallaga Valley
is well drained </p>

<p>and rich in iron, an important element for all plant life. </p>

<p>The area surrounding Cuzco has an average rainfall of between
1.32 and 5.94 </p>

<p>feet annually which usually falls between the months of
October and April. </p>

<p>The average temperatures in this region are greater than 53
degrees </p>

<p>Fahrenheit. Coca is generally grown between 2,409 and 4,257
feet above sea </p>

<p>level. The soil is especially poor in iron content. </p>

<p>A semi-tropical climate with warm days and abundant rain fall,
between 6.6 </p>

<p>and 7.26 feet per annum, characterizes the Ayacucho area. Coca
is usually </p>

<p>grown on steep slopes which require terracing at an elevation
of between </p>

<p>1,650 and 4,290 feet. Soils in this area are red and high in
iron. </p>

<p>Bolivia </p>

<p>Bolivia is the world's second largest source of coca leaf.
There is both </p>

<p>licit and illicit coca cultivation occurring in this country
as well. In </p>

<p>mid-1988, a law became effective that made coca cultivation
illegal in most </p>

<p>of the country. The law also established legal, transitional,
and illegal </p>

<p>zones of cultivation and declared that 12,000 hectares of coca
would be the </p>

<p>amount grown to meet the traditional demand for coca. </p>

<p>There are roughly three main growing areas in Bolivia. The
three areas are </p>

<p>the Yungas de La Paz, the Chapare, and the Apolo. Coca
cultivation in the </p>

<p>Yungas de La Paz is located between the cities of Guanay and
Inquisivi, </p>

<p>northeast of La Paz on the eastern slope of the Andes.
Cultivation in the </p>

<p>Chapare occurs in the provinces of Carrasco, Chapare, and
Arani in the </p>

<p>department of Cochabamba, east of La Paz. The small area of
Apolo is in the </p>

<p>La Paz department north of the city of La Paz. </p>

<p>Nearly all the licit coca is grown in the traditional growing
areas of the </p>

<p>Yungas. The overwhelming amount of illicit coca is grown in
the Chapare where </p>

<p>it is estimated that about 75 percent of the country's coca
crop is </p>

<p>cultivated. The amount of coca grown in the Apolo is much less
than in either </p>

<p>of the two other areas. </p>

<p>Parts of the Yungas have been cultivated for hundreds of
years. Coca is </p>

<p>planted at between 4,800 and 6,000 feet in altitude on
terraced fields, </p>

<p>generally on steep slopes. Some of these fields have a slope
of more than 45 </p>

<p>degrees. The Yungas is characterized by a five-month rainy
season that runs </p>

<p>from December to April receiving about 4 feet of rainfall per
year, followed </p>

<p>by seven dry months. The soil content is poor, and this area
has suffered </p>

<p>severe erosion problems. </p>

<p>In the Chapare, the weather is continually wet and warm, with
an annual </p>

<p>rainfall averaging around 13 feet. The growing areas in this
region are </p>

<p>broad, low plains containing some hills. Coca is cultivated at
between 660 </p>

<p>and 1,650 feet above sea level where the temperature averages
around 57 </p>

<p>degrees Fahrenheit. The soil is clay based, rich alluvial
(sediment deposited </p>

<p>by flowing water). </p>

<p>The Apolo, located in La Paz department, is also a noteworthy
coca-growing </p>

<p>region of Bolivia. Coca in the Apolo region is often
interplanted with </p>

<p>coffee, a major crop in the area. Soil in the Apolo is not
suited very well </p>

<p>to coca; the longevity of a coca bush there is only from five
to eight years. </p>

<p>Coca plants in the Apolo are therefore constantly replaced. </p>

<p>Colombia </p>

<p>Colombia ranks third in worldwide coca leaf production with
all cultivation </p>

<p>being illicit. There is widespread cultivation in the eastern
plains region </p>

<p>of the Llanos which encompasses about one-half of Colombia.
The heaviest </p>

<p>areas of cultivation are located in the departments of
Putumayo, Caqueta, </p>

<p>Guaviare, and Vaupes. There is substantial expansion of the
coca crop in the </p>

<p>Bolivar department in the north-central area of Colombia as
well as areas of </p>

<p>cultivation in the south and southwest part of the country. </p>

<p>In the southern coca-growing region, the temperature averages
between 49.5 </p>

<p>and 52 degrees Fahrenheit and there is light rainfall. Coca is
normally grown </p>

<p>between 3,300 arid 6,600 feet above sea level. The soil in
this region is </p>

<p>iron rich; however, there is some erosion. </p>

<p>COCAINE PROCESSING </p>

<p>The conversion of coca leaves to coca paste, cocaine base, and
cocaine </p>

<p>hydrochloride occurs primarily in Bolivia, Colombia, and Peru.
Peru and </p>

<p>Bolivia are the primary locations for the conversion of leaf
to coca paste </p>

<p>and cocaine base, while Colombia is the primary location for
the final </p>

<p>conversion to cocaine hydrochloride. It is believed that both
Peruvian and </p>

<p>Bolivian traffickers have begun increasing their production of
HCI in the </p>

<p>last few years. </p>

<p>There are a number of chemicals and solvents which play vital
roles in the </p>

<p>processing of coca leaves to paste, base and HCI. Many of
these chemicals are </p>

<p>quite common; all are theoretically substitutable and all have
legitimate </p>

<p>uses making them difficult to control. </p>

<p>Coca processing can be broken down into three stages. The
first is the </p>

<p>conversion of the coca leaf into coca paste; this is almost
always done very </p>

<p>close to the coca fields to cut down on the transport of the
coca leaves. The </p>

<p>second phase is the conversion of coca paste into cocaine
base. This step is </p>

<p>usually omitted in Colombia and the process is taken straight
through from </p>

<p>paste to cocaine HCI. The final stage is conversion of base to
HCI. </p>

<p>Coca Leaves to Coca Paste </p>

<p>The conversion of coca leaf into coca paste is accomplished in
a coca paste </p>

<p>pit, or &quot;pozo. &quot; A typical coca paste pit is a very
crude structure located </p>

<p>near the harvesting site and consists of only a very few
items. Some paste </p>

<p>pits have even been reported in peasants' houses. The paste
pit is usually a </p>

<p>hole in the ground, lined with thick, heavy plastic, or may
even be a </p>

<p>55-gallon drum with the top cut out. Paste pits are often
located near </p>

<p>streams so that the processors will have a constant supply of
fresh water, </p>

<p>which is used in the first stage of processing. The process of
converting </p>

<p>leaves to paste usually takes a few days. Often, however, the
leaves will be </p>

<p>&quot;worked&quot; or &quot;stomped&quot; for only a few hours
rendering less paste than if </p>

<p>&quot;worked&quot; for several days. It is apparently
sometimes more desirable to move </p>

<p>the paste out than to get more paste per kilogram of coca
leaf. Depending on </p>

<p>the size of the pit and the amount of leaf, the whole process
will require </p>

<p>the energy of two to five workers. </p>

<p>The following recipe for coca paste is but one of many.
Recipes will differ </p>

<p>depending on where the laboratory is located. Some will opt
not to use water </p>

<p>in the first step and amounts and mixing times vary widely.
However, this </p>

<p>remains a good benchmark formula. </p>

<p>--Step 1 </p>

<p>The coca leaves are put in an above-ground container or in a
plastic lined </p>

<p>pit. An alkaline material (sodium carbonate) and water are
added to the </p>

<p>leaves. Here the alkaline material enables the cocaine
alkaloid present in </p>

<p>the leaf to be extracted into kerosene. </p>

<p>--Step 2 </p>

<p>A water immiscible solvent (kerosene) is added to water,
solution, and </p>

<p>leaves. The mixture is then agitated. Usually this is
accomplished by having </p>

<p>several people stomp on the leaves. The solvent acts to
extract water </p>

<p>insoluble cocaine alkaloids from the alkaline solution. </p>

<p>--Step 3 </p>

<p>Cocaine alkaloids and kerosene separate from water and leaves.
The water and </p>

<p>leaves are then drained off. </p>

<p>--Step 4 </p>

<p>Cocaine alkaloids are extracted from the kerosene into a
dilute acid </p>

<p>solution. Alkaline material (sodium carbonate) is added to the
remaining </p>

<p>solution which causes a precipitate to form . The acid and the
water are </p>

<p>drained off and the precipitate is filtered and dried to
produce coca paste, </p>

<p>a chunky, off-white to light brown, putty-like </p>

<p>substance. </p>

<p>Coca Paste to Cocaine Base </p>

<p>The processing of coca paste into cocaine base is more
complicated than paste </p>

<p>production, requiring more sophisticated equipment and added
skills. Cocaine </p>

<p>base can be processed at the paste facility, but base
laboratories may be </p>

<p>located away from the cultivation zones. Usually the base
laboratories are </p>

<p>located near rivers or have a clandestine airstrip located in
the vicinity to </p>

<p>facilitate both the movement of coca paste into the base
laboratory, but also </p>

<p>the movement of cocaine base to cocaine HCl laboratories. </p>

<p>As with the paste recipes, the base recipes have many
versions. This one is </p>

<p>one of the more common and a continuation of the paste recipe.
</p>

<p>--Step 1 </p>

<p>The coca paste is added to sulfuric acid or hydrochloric acid
and water. The </p>

<p>paste is dissolved into the acid solution. </p>

<p>--Step 2 </p>

<p>Potassium permanganate is combined with water. This mixture is
added to the </p>

<p>coca paste and acid solution. Potassium permanganate is used
in this step to </p>

<p>extract other alkaloids and material that is undesired in the
final product. </p>

<p>In particular, potassium permanganate is used to break down
the alkaloid </p>

<p>ciscinnamoylcocaine found in large concentrations in E.
novogranatense </p>

<p>varieties. If the coca paste has a high concentration of this
alkaloid and </p>

<p>potassium permanganate is not used, then crystallization of
cocaine HCl will </p>

<p>be very difficult. </p>

<p>--Step 3 </p>

<p>This mixture is allowed to stand for about six hours. </p>

<p>--Step 4 </p>

<p>The solution is filtered and the precipitate is discarded.
Ammonia water is </p>

<p>added to the filtered solution and another precipitate is
formed. </p>

<p>--Step 5 </p>

<p>The liquid is drained from the solution and the remaining
precipitate is </p>

<p>usually dried with heating lamps. The resulting powder is
cocaine base. </p>

<p>It is common in Colombia to skip the base stage of cocaine
processing and go </p>

<p>right from coca paste to cocaine HCl. This can be accomplished
by eliminating </p>

<p>the last part of step number four in coca paste processing and
skipping to </p>

<p>step number two of the cocaine base phase where the coca paste
is added to </p>

<p>the potassium permanganate solution. </p>

<p>Cocaine Base to Cocaine Hydrochloride (HCl) </p>

<p>The final stage of cocaine processing requires even more skill
and equipment, </p>

<p>and is much more dangerous than the previously mentioned
steps. Unlike paste </p>

<p>and base processing, cocaine HCl processing calls for
expensive chemicals </p>

<p>that are harder to find and often not manufactured in the
processing country. </p>

<p>The HCl laboratory usually consists of several buildings
including </p>

<p>dormitories, eating facilities, an office, storage facilities,
and the </p>

<p>laboratory itself. Also usually found at HCl laboratories are
communications </p>

<p>operations, generators, filtering and drying equipment, and,
more recently, </p>

<p>chemical recycling facilities. The HCl laboratory will
sometimes have direct </p>

<p>access to an airstrip. </p>

<p>The following recipe is a continuation of the above two. At
this point the </p>

<p>methods of processing vary only slightly. </p>

<p>--Step 1 </p>

<p>Acetone or ether is added to dissolve the cocaine base and the
solution is </p>

<p>filtered to remove undesired material. </p>

<p>--Step 2 </p>

<p>Hydrochloric acid diluted in acetone or ether is added to the
cocaine </p>

<p>solution. The addition of the hydrochloric acid causes the
cocaine to </p>

<p>precipitate (crystallize) out of the solution as cocaine
hydrochloride. </p>

<p>--Step 3 </p>

<p>The remaining acetone/ether solvent can be discarded or
reused. </p>

<p>--Step 4 </p>

<p>Cocaine HCl is dried under heat lamps, laid out to dry with
the aid of fans, </p>

<p>or dried in microwave ovens. </p>

<p>NATURAL ENEMIES AND ERADICATION EFFORTS </p>

<p>Although the coca bush is a very strong plant and will live
for many years </p>

<p>and produce many harvests of leaf, it will do better if taken
care of, </p>

<p>fertilized, and treated with herbicides and insecticides. </p>

<p>Occasionally, a coca field will become infested with one of
the plant's </p>

<p>natural enemies. The main pests and the effect that they are
known to have on </p>

<p>the plant are discussed below. </p>

<p>The larvae of the moth Eloria Noyesi presents the most serious
threat to the </p>

<p>coca plant. This moth lives through out the coca-growing
region of South </p>

<p>America and seems to feed almost exclusively on E. coca. It
has also been </p>

<p>recorded feeding on E. novogranatense in Colombia and northern
Peru. The </p>

<p>larva will develop in about a month and will eat up to 50
leaves in its </p>

<p>lifetime. The larva will also eat the shoots of the bush that
grow out after </p>

<p>harvest. If Eloria attacks a plant repeatedly, even a strong
plant will die. </p>

<p>The moth is usually only abundant from December to April. Coca
growers are </p>

<p>using insecticides to eradicate Eloria. </p>

<p>The larvae of Eucleodora Coca, a fly, seems to cause harm only
to Trujillo </p>

<p>coca. (There have been major infestations of this insect in
the past usually </p>

<p>occuring from April to August.) The larvae spend their entire
lives on the </p>

<p>plant, feeding on the leaves and shoots . As with the Eloria,
Eucleodora is </p>

<p>being controlled with insecticides. </p>

<p>Very little is known about the effect of the leaf-cutting ant,
Acromyrmex, on </p>

<p>coca. Growers in the Upper Huallaga Valley report that serious
damage in the </p>

<p>past has been done to their coca cultivation. The damage is
often controlled </p>

<p>with the use of insecticides and flooding. The beetle,
Aegoidus Pacificus, </p>

<p>also poses a threat to Trujillo coca. The adult beetle lays
her eggs in the </p>

<p>bark of the coca plant, and the larva later burrows into the
stem of the </p>

<p>plant. This usually results in an infestation of pathogenic
fungi which is </p>

<p>ultimately responsible for the death of the coca plant. As
with the other </p>

<p>pests, the beetle can also be controlled with insecticides. </p>

<p>Most of the other insects which attack coca only do so when
there are </p>

<p>shortages of their normal food supply. Some scientists believe
that cocaine </p>

<p>and other alkaloids may present some natural defense against
most pests. </p>

<p>Nevertheless, sometimes insects such as spider mites,
grasshoppers, </p>

<p>leafhoppers, and beetles find it necessary to eat coca. </p>

<p>The coca plant is also susceptible to numerous species of
pathogenic fungi. </p>

<p>Fungi seem to present the greatest threat to a plant during
the wet season. </p>

<p>The most serious threat seems to come from a fungus called
&quot;witches broom .&quot; </p>

<p>The exact effect of this fungus on the coca plant is not clear
because of the </p>

<p>limited amount of study which has been done on this fungus
infesting coca </p>

<p>plantations. </p>

<p>Natural enemies hold hope for control of the coca plant in the
future. At </p>

<p>present, however, the most successful methods in controlling
the growth of </p>

<p>coca are herbicides and manual eradication. </p>

<p>As of early 1990, all eradication of the coca plant in Bolivia
and Colombia </p>

<p>was being done manually. The usual method has been for a team
of eradication </p>

<p>workers to go into a field and pull up the bushes plant by
plant. In Peru, </p>

<p>manual eradication of coca is often suspended because of
security reasons. </p>

<p>Prior to that time, a number of gasoline-powered cutters had
been supplied to </p>

<p>the workers making it easier and much quicker to cut the coca.
The problem </p>

<p>with this method is that sometimes the coca bush will sprout
from the stump </p>

<p>within 12 to 18 months. As such, the cutting must be made very
close to the </p>

<p>ground to insure that the plant does not sprout again. </p>

<p>A number of herbicides have been tested for use in eradicating
the coca plant </p>

<p>including hexazinone and tebuthiuron (spike) . Application of
both has been </p>

<p>deemed successful in killing the plant as long as they are
applied in the </p>

<p>correct manner and amount. Within ten to twenty days after
application of </p>

<p>hexazinone or tebuthiuron the coca bush sheds all its leaves
and usually </p>

<p>within 60 to 90 days the coca plant will be completely dead. </p>

<p>The United States is working with some South American
governments to develop </p>

<p>an herbicidal eradication program; Bolivia, however, has
prohibited the use </p>

<p>of herbicides for this purpose. </p>

<h1>DEA Congressional Testimony </h1>

<hr size="10" noshade>

<p> <em>Statement by:<br>
</em><b>Thomas A. Constantine<br>
Administrator<br>
Drug Enforcement Administration<br>
United States Department of Justice</b> <br>
<br>
<em>Before the:<br>
</em><strong>Senate Foreign Relations Committee</strong> <br>
<br>
<em>Regarding:<br>
</em><strong>International Drug Trafficking Organizations in
Mexico</strong> <br>
<br>
<em>Location:<br>
</em><strong>Dirksen Senate Office Building<br>
Room 419<br>
Washington, D.C.</strong> <br>
<br>
<em>Date:<br>
</em><strong>August 8, 1995</strong> <br>
<br>
<em>Note:</em> This document may not reflect changes made in

<br>
<br>
<br>
Mr. Chairman, Members of the Committee: I'm pleased to appear
before you today to discuss the growing role of international
drug trafficking organizations operating in Mexico and to tell
you what the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) is doing to
attack these organizations that are responsible for smuggling
tons of illegal drugs across the U.S./Mexico border. <br>
<br>
Mexico is pivotal to the success of any U.S. drug strategy. Not
only do we share a common border, through which three-fourths of
the cocaine enters our country, but Mexico has long been a major
source country for heroin and marijuana. Within the last few
years, it has also become a major source country for
methamphetamine, as well as a transit country for chemicals,
especially ephedrine, used in the manufacture of methamphetamine.
<br>
<br>
My purpose at this hearing today is to talk about the drug
trafficking situation and to highlight our concerns about the
increased role of these international drug gangs operating in
Mexico. My comments will be limited to observations on
trafficking organizations and their methods of smuggling, the law
enforcement communities' efforts to work with Mexico, and an
assessment of our chances for success in decreasing the flood of
illegal drugs that enter this country each day and have a
devastating impact on the citizens on both sides of the border. <br>
<br>
<strong>A Glimpse of the Problem</strong> <br>
<br>
Mr. Chairman, an important 1989 drug seizure gave us a glimpse of
the magnitude of the problem law enforcement faces and also
illustrates just how important Mexico is to our efforts to
control illegal drugs coming into our country. In late 1989, DEA
made America's largest cocaine seizure on record (over 21.5 tons)
in Sylmar, California. <br>
<br>
This cocaine came across the border at El Paso and was trucked to
the West Coast. Drug law enforcement was encouraged by such a
huge seizure, and we were convinced that we had seriously wounded
the Colombian drug organizations by preventing such a large
amount of illegal drugs from reaching our streets. <br>
<br>
But, we realized our encouragement was premature when we analyzed
seized records. What we found was even more astounding. We
learned that during only a 3-month period, the organization had
succeeded in smuggling 55 tons of cocaine into the U.S. This
cocaine had been trucked to Los Angeles and had already been
distributed on our streets. <br>
<br>
One of the most disturbing aspects of this case is that ten years
ago, we measured drug seizures in grams and pounds. Today, we
routinely measure seizures in tons-even multitons. In January,
for example, in Pasadena, Texas, a suburb of Houston, we seized
6.5 tons of cocaine. In July, we seized over 5 tons of cocaine in
the border town of El Paso. And one of the primary reasons for
these multiton shipments of cocaine is the efficient and
mutually-rewarding relationship that has emerged between the
cocaine mafia in Colombia and the drug trafficking groups
operating in Mexico. <br>
<br>
In fact, Mr. Chairman, we estimate that the Colombian drug mafia
is using Mexico as a cocaine safe haven to store, at any one
time, as much as 70 to 100 tons of cocaine that will eventually
be smuggled across the U.S. border for distribution on American
streets. This is enough to provide a line of cocaine to every
man, woman, and child on this planet--and then some. At a
conservative estimate, this cocaine would be worth over $700
million to $1 billion on America's streets. <br>
<br>
<strong>Role of the International Drug Traffickers</strong> <br>
<br>
The fact that these traffickers have been able to accommodate the
transportation needs of the Cali cocaine mafia is not something
that happened overnight. Criminal organizations from Mexico have
had decades of practice. Traditionally, the Mexican border
economies have been significantly affected by the smuggling
activities into and out of the United States. It was these
organized smuggling organizations that rose to prominence in the
late 1960s and 1970s when marijuana trafficking presented the
potential for huge profits. <br>
<br>
During the early 1980's, most of the Colombian cocaine entered
the United States through South Florida by way of the Caribbean.
But, traffickers were forced to find new routes when U.S. drug
agencies increased enforcement action in the Caribbean and South
Florida. The Colombian drug lords naturally turned to the
trafficking groups in Mexico which had what they were looking
for: proximity to the United States, a 2,000 mile expanse of
border offering unlimited smuggling possibilities, and an already
established drug trafficking infrastructure that stood ready to
serve their needs. <br>
<br>
The drug trafficking organizations easily adapted their
operations to include cocaine trafficking, and by the mid-80's,
were well-established and reliable transporters of Colombian
cocaine. Delegating cocaine transportation to the traffickers in
Mexico was a tactical decision on the part of the Cali mafia.
With the transportation assistance of these traffickers, the
cocaine barons could now move larger bulk quantities through
Mexico which would have been logistically impossible to move by
any other means. By turning the riskiest part of the cocaine
distribution cycle (the transportation) over to these
traffickers, the Cali mafia could turn its attention to other
aspects of their cocaine enterprise. This drug trafficking
partnership has become one of both convenience and profit. <br>
<br>
One of the first traffickers to move cocaine through Mexico and
to the U.S. was Juan Ramon Matta-Ballesteros, a Honduran, who,
from the mid-'70s to the mid-'80s, was actively involved with the
Mexican Guadalajara Cartel. This was the group responsible for
the kidnapping torture and murder of DEA Special Agent Enrique
(Kiki) Camarena in 1985. The death of Agent Camarena outraged the
American public. Matta-Ballesteros has been convicted in three
separate U.S. cases and is serving a term of life imprisonment. <br>
<br>
<strong>Emerging Traffickers Coming into their Own</strong> <br>
<br>
Today, there is no question that drug traffickers operating in
Mexico have become major players in the international drug trade.
These veteran traffickers have been good students and have
learned valuable lessons from the drug experts--the Cali mafia.
They have seen the benefit (and profits) of working together in a
partnership to provide a needed transportation service to the
cocaine organizations in Colombia. Receiving payment in both cash
and cocaine, they have begun to establish their own cocaine
distribution networks and territories, stretching from the
Southwest border areas as far as New York. In effect, the Cali
mafia has been a willing partner in helping these organizations
create distribution and sales networks in the U.S. <br>
<br>
Like the Cali mafia, these trafficking organizations have
demonstrated their flexibility to change trafficking routes when
law enforcement action along any one route becomes too risky to
their business. These drug groups have also followed the lead of
their predecessors by expanding and diversifying their product
line. Sophisticated trafficking organizations based in Mexico now
manufacture methamphetamine and smuggle the precursor chemicals
necessary for its manufacture. And, perhaps most important, as
they have expanded their role in the drug trade, they have made
valuable worldwide contacts, which will be necessary as they
continue to establish themselves as important players in the
world of illegal drugs. <br>
<br>
There are a number of trafficking groups in Mexico that have
gained a firm foothold in the trafficking of drugs, but I'd like
to take a moment to describe the four major drug trafficking
organizations that work closely with the Cali mafia: <br>
<br>
<strong>Tijuana Cartel</strong> <br>
<br>
The organization sometimes referred to the &quot;Tijuana
Cartel,&quot; is headed by Benjamin Arellano-Felix and his
brother Francisco. They control most of the drugs crossing the
border on the West Coast between Tijuana and Mexicali. <br>
<br>
Feuding between this group and other organizations has become
increasingly violent. In fact, it was the feuding between the
Arrellano-Felix organization and rival drug dealers that led to
the killing of Catholic Cardinal Juan Jesus Posadas-Ocampo at the
Guadalajara airport in 1993 <br>
<br>
The Arellano-Felix brothers are currently the subjects of a
nationwide manhunt by law enforcement authorities for their
involvement in the Cardinal's killing. On June 23, Mexican
authorities arrested Hector Luis Palma-Salazar, the leader of a
rival drug organization that is believed to be behind the
attempted assassinations of the Arellano-Felix brothers, as well
as the murder of Cardinal Posadas-Ocampo. Benjamin and Francisco
Arellano-Felix have both been indicted in San Diego, California,
and are DEA fugitives. <br>
<br>
<strong>The Caro-Ouintero Organization</strong> <br>
<br>
The Caro-Quintero organization is involved in the cultivation,
processing, smuggling and distribution of heroin and marijuana
and the transportation of Colombian cocaine into the U.S. This
organization was previously led by Rafael Caro-Quintero, known as
the &quot;Mexican Rhinestone Cowboy,&quot; who began his criminal
career at the young age of 12 or 13 as an apprentice to Pedro
Aviles, a notorious Mexican drug trafficker. <br>
<br>
Caro-Quintero is currently in a Mexican maximum security prison
for his involvement in the kidnaping, torture and murder of DEA
Special Agent Enrique Camarena, as well as for marijuana and
cocaine trafficking. His brother, Miguel Caro-Quintero, now runs
the organization, and is under indictment in Tucson and Denver. <br>
<br>
<strong>Juarez: Cartel</strong> <br>
<br>
One of the most notorious and powerful of these trafficking
organizations is the Amado Carrillo-Fuentes organization,
sometimes referred to as the &quot;Juarez Cartel.&quot;
Carrillo-Fuentes has been the chief transporter for the recently
arrested Cali mafia leader Miguel Rodriguez-Orejuela. <br>
<br>
Carrillo-Fuentes owns several airline companies, which enables
him to fly 727s from Colombia into Juarez, where he runs his
organization from his ranch headquarters. Increasingly, murders
in Juarez have been associated with Carrillo-Fuentes. In July,
the leader of the juvenile gangs he recruits to smuggle drugs
across the border was found shot 23 times in the head. Here in
the United States, Carrillo-Fuentes has been indicted in Miami on
heroin and marijuana charges, and in Dallas on cocaine charges. <br>
<br>
<strong>Juan Garcia-Abrego</strong> <br>
<br>
Another influential Mexican trafficker acting in concert with the
Cali mafia is Juan Garcia-Abrego, who is involved in smuggling
drugs from the Yucatan area in Mexico to South Texas and up to
New York. Juan Garcia-Abrego was recently added to the FBI's top
ten most wanted fugitives, with a $2 million reward for his
capture. This is the first time an international drug trafficker
has been included on the FBI list. <br>
<br>
This organization transports large quantities of cocaine for the
Cali mafia, as well as marijuana and heroin for other
traffickers. Garcia-Abrego pioneered deals in which Mexican
traffickers take payment in cocaine, which substantially raised
their profits, and at the same time diversified their involvement
from beyond smuggling to the role of suppliers to their own drug
distribution networks. He and his organization are notorious for
the violence they employ to further and protect their illicit
trade. <br>
<br>
He also ships bulk amounts of cash for the Cali mafia. During a
four-year period, from 1989 to 1993, $53 million was seized in
connection with the Garcia-Abrego organization. Two American
Express bankers in Brownsville, Texas, were indicted for
laundering $30 million for Garcia-Abrego, and to date, 70 members
of his organization have been prosecuted and convicted in the
U.S. Juan Garcia-Abrego has been indicted in Houston and remains
a fugitive. <br>
<br>
<strong>Expanding Influence: Cocaine and Methamphetamine</strong>
<br>
<br>
DEA is very concerned about the expanding role of drug
organizations based in Mexico which are playing an increasingly
larger role in the shipment and distribution of cocaine and
methamphetamine to the United States. <br>
<br>
<strong>Cocaine</strong> <br>
<br>
In the last few years, we've seen international trafficking
organizations make major changes in their efficiency in
transporting bulk shipments of cocaine to transporting
organizations in Mexico. Traditionally trafficking organizations
used twin-engine general aviation aircraft to transport cocaine
from Colombia to transhipment locations in Mexico and the
Caribbean. Today, however, the Cali mafia has bought passenger
jets (like 727's) gutted them, and are using them to transport
multiton loads of cocaine to the trafficking organizations in
Mexico. In March of this year, for example, a Caravelle jet
aircraft was seized in the Mexican State of Sonora, after being
abandoned by traffickers when its tires became stuck in the dirt
runway. Mexican Government forces later seized 2.8 tons of
cocaine that are believed to have been off-loaded from that
Caravelle. <br>
<br>
Law enforcement has also uncovered two tunnels built to move
cocaine from Mexico into the United States. The first was
discovered in Arizona in 1990. The second nearly-completed tunnel
was discovered in 1993 near the Tijuana Airport and led to an
unfinished warehouse in the United States. <br>
<br>
<strong>Methamphetamine</strong> <br>
<br>
U.S. law enforcement is also concerned about the growing role of
trafficking gangs operating in Mexico involved in the
methamphetamine trade. We directly attribute the increased
amounts of methamphetamine available in the U.S. to these
trafficking organizations which have replaced domestic outlaw
motorcycle gangs as the predominant methamphetamine producers,
traffickers, and distributors. <br>
<br>
Unfortunately, DEA is very much aware of the problem of these
methamphetamine gangs operating in the U.S. Last summer, DEA
Special Agent Richard Fass was shot and killed in Tucson by a
methamphetamine trafficker during an undercover operation. The
ring leader of the gang responsible for Agent Fass' death has
still not been apprehended and is believed to be in Mexico. The
DEA is currently working with both the FBI and Mexican
authorities to apprehend him. <br>
<br>
In the last three years, these trafficking organizations have
virtually saturated the western United States market with
high-purity methamphetamine, known also as &quot;speed&quot;
or&quot;crank.&quot; In some areas of California, it has now
reportedly replaced cocaine as the drug of choice. With a
saturated West Coast market, these traffickers have begun to
expand their markets to the East Coast and in the South. DEA's
southern offices report a growing presence of these trafficking
groups providing methamphetamine to domestic trafficking
organizations in rural and suburban areas of Georgia, Tennessee,
Kentucky, and the Carolinas. <br>
<br>
As supplies have increased, prices have fallen, making it a cheap
alternative to cocaine. Some have called it the &quot;poor man's
cocaine.&quot; In 1991, for example, the lowest pound price
nationwide was $6,000. Today, in California, methamphetamine
sells for between $2,500 and $3,600 per pound. <br>
<br>
With increased availability, methamphamine use has increased.
According to the Drug Abuse Warning Network, the number of
emergency room episodes involving methamphetamine has increased
steadily since 1991, particularly in the West. From 1991 to 1993,
episodes more than doubled in both Los Angeles and Phoenix. <br>
<br>
The dominance of Mexico-based, poly-drug organizations in
methamphetamine trafficking is further evidence of their growing
sophistication. The smuggling skills developed while transporting
cocaine for the Cali mafia has enabled these organizations to
branch out into moving other contraband, such as precursor
chemicals, especially ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, used in the
manufacture of methamphetamine . <br>
<br>
They have established international connections in Europe, Asia
and the Far East to obtain the shipment of tons of precursor
chemicals, particularly ephedrine, to addresses in both United
States and Mexico. During 1993 and 1994, the majority of
ephedrine shipments destined for Mexico were supplied by such
diverse countries as China, India, the Czech Republic, and
Switzerland. From mid-1993 to early 1995, DEA documented the
diversion of almost 170 tons of ephedrine used in illicit
methamphetamine production. It's important to note, however, that
DEA has obtained cooperation from many of these countries to stem
the flow of chemicals going to Mexico. <br>
<br>
It's difficult to predict where this newest surge of
methamphetamine use and trafficking will lead, but we must not
assume that it has peaked. Unlike other drugs, methamphetamine is
one that these criminal organizations can control entirely from
beginning to end. They have the international contacts to obtain
the necessary precursor chemicals to make the drug. They have the
clandestine labs to process the chemicals into methamphetamine on
both sides of the border. They have expanded their distribution
networks across the nation by the use and intimidation of illegal
aliens. And, unlike their previous role as middle-men moving
cocaine and heroin, they can keep 100 percent of the profits from
their methamphetamine sales. <br>
<br>
U. S. law enforcement may be in for a difficult and violent few
years as we work to get the methamphetamine problem under
control. We've already seen &quot;meth&quot; smuggling gangs face
off against each other. Recently, in San Diego, a confrontation
between meth smuggling groups with ties to Mexico resulted in 26
homicides. There may be more bloodshed on our streets, as these
drug gangs fight to protect (and expand) their drug turf. <br>
<br>
<strong>DEA's Response</strong> <br>
<br>
In response to the threats of the Mexico-based trafficking
organizations and their surrogate drug gangs operating here in
the United States, DEA has taken a number of steps to work with
our law enforcement partners in Mexico, as well as with our
Federal, state, and local colleagues here at home. <br>
<br>
DEA has joined forces with the FBI in a Southwest Border
Initiative that targets the major Mexican trafficking
organizations for enforcement actions. Combined teams of state,
local and federal law enforcement led by DEA and FBI Special
Agents are working together with a common goal of disrupting
these gangs and bringing their leaders to justice. <br>
<br>
For the first time, the DEA, the FBI, the Department of Justice
Criminal Division, and respective U.S. Attorneys in every state
along the Southwest Border are coordinating both intelligence and
manpower resources against a common enemy--the poly-drug
trafficking organizations that are transporting increased amounts
of cocaine, heroin, marijuana, and methamphetamine across our
borders. Both the DEA and the FBI hold high expectations for the
success for this operation. <br>
<br>
Three new binational Border Task Forces have been established and
will focus on the four principal trafficking organizations.
Senior personnel of the DEA, FBI, and DOJ Criminal Division serve
on a U.S./Mexican Plenary Group, working to enhance our
cooperation against narcotics, money laundering, arms smuggling,
and other crimes. <br>
<br>
Mr. Chairman, in this open forum I cannot explain the specifics
of how this new initiative will work, but I would be happy to
discuss this in more detail in a closed session or a private
briefing. <br>
<br>
Our support for Mexico's drug fighting efforts is critical to
their success--and ultimately to our own. Attorney General Reno
and Mexican Attorney General Antonio Lozano-Gracia have pledged
to work cooperatively to address the problems. Hopefully, a close
and coordinated law enforcement response by our two countries
will have an impact on this growing problem. <br>
<br>
<strong>Future Threats: An Assessment</strong> <br>
<br>
There is no question that the international drug trafficking
organizations operating in Colombia and Mexico have had a direct
impact on the multiton quantities of cocaine law enforcement is
forced to deal with today. These organizations have proven to be
a serious threat to both the United States and Mexico. <br>
<br>
In recent years, as the political and economic ties between the
United States and Mexico have strengthened, a new generation of
international traffickers have been able to carve out an ever
larger share of the world's drug trade and pose a growing threat
on both sides of the border. We've seen these trafficking
organizations grow from low-level smuggling groups to
sophisticated organizations that smuggle more and more drugs of
every kind--cocaine, heroin, marijuana, and now
methamphetamine--into the U.S. They are increasingly being paid
for their transportation expertise with cocaine, a move that
could prove to be the undoing of the Cali mafia and could shift
the balance of power within the worldwide cocaine trade. <br>
<br>
Mr. Chairman, in a few years down the road, I believe it's
entirely possible that these newly emerging groups could rise to
an equal (or superior) footing with the Cali mafia. If this
happens, life as we know it in both the United States and Mexico
will change dramatically. They care little for the devasting
impact they have on the people of Mexico and the United States.
They are international criminal elements that must be dealt with.
<br>
<br>
The President of Mexico, Ernesto Zedillo, has publically stated
to the American media that drug trafficking is a threat to
Mexican national security, not only because of the crime that is
inherent in such activity, but also because of the growing wealth
that enables traffickers to corrupt police and government
institutions. <br>
<br>
As these organizations grow in wealth and sophistication, they
threaten to overwhelm the capabilities of any law enforcement
system, including Mexico. By comparison, we have a professional
law enforcement system in the United States, at the Federal,
state and local level, that promotes and encourages high
standards in recruitment, training, internal inspections,
standards of operations and accountability to electecl officials.
<br>
<br>
We have a criminal justice system that is quick to respond to
charges of unethical or corrupt actions on the part of law
enforcement. It has helped to professionalize our law enforcement
agencies and insure a continuing quest for ethics and integrity.
Despite our best efforts, unethical or illegal activities do
occasionally occur within the ranks of our law enforcement
agencies, requiring swift and decisive government action to
preserve the public's faith and trust. <br>
<br>
As a society, we provide modern and sophisticated resources to
our law enforcement agencies to combat the criminal elements
confronting them. The law enforcement institutions in Mexico do
not presently have an infrastructure similar to those in the U.S.
The development of such institutions will require a substantial
commitment of time and resources to achieve the necessary level
of professionalism. The potential exists that if this is not
done, they may be overwhelmed by the wealth and influence of the
drug organizations. <br>
<br>
We are not alone in recognizing this problem. Attorney General
Lozano has moved to have special police units report directly to
him. He has announced a plan to include reviews of all Federal
police officers and prosecutors, with mandatory drug testing, to
combat internal corruption. I cite this only to illustrate that
the Mexican government itself recognizes this is a problem. <br>
<br>
It is imperative that we work with our partners in Mexico to
blunt the influence these drug traffickers are having in both our
countries. It is also imperative that our own Federal, state, and
local law enforcement continue to work cooperatively together to
make the best use of our resources, as well as to increase our
impact on these trafficking organizations. Surely, when we speak
of tons of drugs coming across our borders and causing tremendous
damage to the health and well-being of our citizens, we are
talking of a national security threat that demands our immediate
and continuous attention. <br>
<br>
DEA is hopeful that future counterdrug efforts with Mexico will
be successful. In the past year, Mexico has instituted new
programs that include attempts to professionalize its law
enforcement institutions and increase cross-border cooperation to
address the threat of the international traffickers. The direct
and cooperative communication between Attorney General Reno and
Attorney General Lozano should be of great help in securing a
coordination of our resources to address a common problem. The
threat is serious--and it is real. <br>

<p>Needle exchange talking points </p>

<p>Origins of the University of California study </p>

<p>Former drug czar Bob Martinez and former Centers for Disease
Control (CDC) director Bill Roper decide in Summer '91 that
objective review of data on needle exchange programs (NEPs) is
needed </p>

<p>University of California (UC), Berkeley and UC San Francisco
agree to do the work </p>

<p>Study is funded by CDC through a Cooperative Agreement with
the Association of Schools of Public Health </p>

<p>Pls are Arthur Reingold (UC Berkeley) and Philip R. Lee (UC
San Francisco) </p>

<p>Lee leaves 7/1/94 to be Assistant Secretary for Health;
replaced as Pl by Peter Lurie, formerly Project Director </p>

<p>Approximate total cost of study $400,000 </p>

<p>Work begins 4/1/92 </p>

<p>The University of California study </p>

<p>3 volumes, &gt;700 pages </p>

<p>Entailed review of 2000 documents, visits to 23 programs in 15
cities in 4 countries, interviews with almost 250 individuals,
mail survey of programs not visited, mathematical modeling of
cost-effectiveness </p>

<p>Conclusions: </p>

<p>available [data] provide no evidence that needle exchange
programs increase the amount of drug use by needle exchange
program clients or change overall community levels of
non-injection and injection drug use.&quot; (page 18 of report
Summary) </p>

<p>Multiple lines of evidence suggest that it is likely that NEPs
decrease the rate of new HIV infection: (page 26) </p>

<p>1. Biologic plausibility; removing potentially infected
syringes from circulation and replacing them with clean ones must
decrease new infections </p>

<p>2. Behavioral data: 10/14 studies showed a decrease in HIV
risk behavior (the sharing of syringes) and none showed an
increase </p>

<p>3. Three- to four-fold decrease in new hepatitis B infections
[with later data this increased to seven- to eight-fold for
hepatitis B and C infection] </p>

<p>4. Mathematical models from New Haven (33% decrease in new HIV
infections) and by the UC study model (15-17% </p>

<p>Recommendations (page 27): </p>

<p>The federal government should repeal the ban on the use of
federal funds for needle exchange services.&quot; </p>

<p>Substantial federal funds should be committed to both
providing needle exchange services and to expanding research into
these programs. </p>

<p>State governments in the ten states and the District of
Columbia that have prescription laws should repeal these laws. </p>

<p>States should repeal the paraphernalia laws as they apply to
syringes. </p>

<p>Report released 9/30/93 </p>

<p>About 12,000 copies of various volumes of the report
distributed </p>

<p>The first review </p>

<p>On October 15, 1993, Joe Boufford, Principal Deputy Assistant
Secretary for Health (Lee's office), writes to CDC Director David
Satcher requesting a review of the UC report and providing
opinions and recommendations for federal action in response to
needle exchange. </p>

<p>CDC consults with NIH (NIDA), FDA, HRSA and SAMSHA (Substance
Abuse Mental Health Services Administration). Their comments are
attached as tabs to the review. </p>

<p>Conclusions: </p>

<p>The UC research team has done a careful and scientifically
sound compilation and review of all the available data on needle
exchange and the availability of needles and syringes to
injection drug users.&quot; (page 1) The UC team used stringent
scientific standards in its analysis and interpretation of the
collected published and unpublished studies ... The UC report is
the most extensive and comprehensive study of needle exchange
ever published.&quot; (page 6) </p>

<p>After reviewing several lines of evidence similar to the four
points listed above, the review concludes: Taken together, these
observations indicate that NEPs are likely to reduce HIV
transmission, even though the epidemiologic studies of NEPs do
not definitively demonstrate decreases or increases in HIV
transmission.&quot; (page 2) Several findings strongly support
the conclusion that NEPs reduce HIV transmission.&quot; (page 10)
</p>

<p>No data exists indicating increases related to NEPs in either
drug use or in the number of discarded syringes.&quot; (page 2)
We agree with the UC team conclusion that available data are
quite limited but provide no evidence of any NEP-related
increases in community levels of drug use.&quot; (page 10) </p>

<p>&quot;... we believe that the benefits of NEPs as a component
of a comprehensive HIV prevention program for drug users exceed
the theoretical risks of such programs.&quot; (page 2) </p>

<p>&quot;We conclude that the ban on Federal funding of NEPs
should be lifted to allow communities and States to use Federal
funds to support NEPs as components of comprehensive HIV
prevention programs.&quot; (page 2) </p>

<p>&quot;We also recommend that States consider the repeal of
laws requiring a physician's prescription to buy needles and
syringes and the removal of criminal penalties for the possession
of needles and syringes&quot; (page 2) </p>

<p>Fate of the first review </p>

<p>Review signed by Satcher and sent to Boufford on December 10,
1993. </p>

<p>Review has never been made public. </p>

<p>Rep. Henry Waxman obtained a copy, but only under condition
that it not be released to the public. </p>

<p>Review not disclosable under the Freedom of Information Act; a
request by San Francisco Chronicle for the review was denied
recently. </p>

<p>Only real press coverage is reference to the coverup on CNN in
August 1994 and in San Francisco Chronicle in December 1994. </p>

<p>The second review </p>

<p>In fall 1994, Brian Biles of the Office of the Assistant
Secretary for Health, wrote to CDC asking for an update on
information since the University of California Report. </p>

<p>This second review, much shorter and less expansive than the
first review, is sent to the Associate Director for HIV/AIDS
(James Curran) by the Assistant Director for Substance Abuse and
HIV Prevention (T. Stephen Jones) on November 22, 1994, and
presumably forwarded on to the Office of the Assistant Secretary
for Health. </p>

<p>The review contains the following: </p>

<p>Summary of new evidence from New York City showing a decrease
in HIV transmission among NEP clients that concludes that
although the numbers are small, the evidence is plausible.&quot;
(page 1 ). </p>

<p>Three additional studies with evidence of decreases in HIV
risk behavior (page 3). </p>

<p>No evidence of increased drug use in a San Francisco study
(page 3). </p>

<p>New data showing that the decrease in hepatitis B and C
infections associated with needle exchange is now seven- to
eight-fold. 'this study demonstrates more clearly than any
previous research that use of NEPs is associated with decreases
in blood borne infections.&quot; (Page 4) </p>

<p>Data from Montreal showing higher HIV infection rates, higher
rates of HIV risk behaviors and higher rates of new HIV infection
among NEP clients that &quot;require further study.&quot; (page
5) This finding is most reasonably interpreted as showing that
NEPs are reaching the drug users at highest risk for HIV (a good
thing). </p>

<p>No formal recommendations with respect to federal policy. </p>

<p>The existence of this review has never been made public. </p>

<p>Public health significance </p>

<p>Approximately 1/3 of all AIDS cases occur among injections
drug users, their sex partners and their children. </p>

<p>Only about 15% of injectors are in drug treatment on any given
day. </p>

<p>Over 10,000 drug users, their sex partners and their children
contract HIV each year. This is 1-2 preventable HIV infections
per hour. Needle exchange may decrease new HIV infections by 33%,
according to the New Haven mathematical model. </p>

<p>1. ISSUE </p>

<p>On October 15, 1993, the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary
for Health requested that the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) review the University of California (UC)
research report on needle exchange (executive summary at Tab A)
and provide recommendations and opinions on Federal action in
response to needle exchange to the Principal Deputy Assistant
Secretary for Health and the Surgeon General. </p>

<p>The UC report and recommendations were reviewed by CDC staff.
The CDC also requested and received comments on the UC report and
recommendations and opinions on Federal action in response to
needle exchange from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) (Tab
B), the Substance Abuse Mental Health Services Administration
(SAMHSA) (Tab C), the Health Services and Resources
Administration (HSRA) (Tab D), and the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) (Tab E). Comments on this report to you were
also requested from these agencies. The agencies were not asked
for final concurrence on the CDC response. The attached comments
(Tabs B-E) were provided by the Principal AIDS Coordinators of
the four agencies. </p>

<p>2. SUMMARY </p>

<p>The UC research team has done a careful and scientifically
sound compilation and review of all the available data on needle
exchange and the availability of needles and syringes to
injection drug users (IDUs). The UC team also gathered new data
through surveys of needle exchange programs (NEPs), key informant
interviews, and focus groups of IDUs. </p>

<p>NEPs are intended to decrease human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV) transmission associated with injection drug use by
replacing used, potentially HIV-infected syringes with sterile
ones. They also can help IDUs obtain drug treatment and other
public health services. The emergence of more than three dozen
NEPs in the United States suggests an increasing acceptance of
these programs as part of a community response to the dual
epidemics of injection drug use and HIV infection. However, in
some communities, NEPs have been very controversial. Some law
enforcement, drug treatment, and community leaders are concerned
that these programs give &quot;the wrong message&quot; about drug
use and may reduce law enforcement agencies' ability to combat
drug use and associated violence. Other concerns are that NEPs
have not been shown to be effective in eliminating HIV
transmission and may draw scarce resources away from other,
possibly more effective, programs such as drug treatment. </p>

<p>The CDC concurs with the UC findings that (1) NEPs are
effective in removing used, sometimes HIV-contaminated needles
and syringes from circulation and replacing them with sterile
ones, (2) IDUs using NEPs decrease HIV drug-risk behaviors (e.g.,
decreased sharing of injection equipment, decreased frequency of
injection), (3) NEPs are effective in recruiting IDUs to enter
drug treatment, (4) HIV prevalence in syringes returned to NEPs
decreases, and (5) mathematical models of NEPs estimate
substantial decreases in HIV transmission among NEP clients.
Taken together, these observations indicate that NEPs are likely
to reduce HIV transmission, even though the epidemiologic studies
of NEPs do not definitively demonstrate decreases or increases in
HIV transmission. The existing epidemiologic studies are limited
in their ability to detect such changes. No data exists
indicating increases related to NEPs in either drug use or in the
number of discarded syringes. W8 endorse the UC report
recommendation that additional research and evaluation on NEPs is
a high priority to further assess the impact of these programs-s
and the relative effectiveness of various models of delivery of
NEP services. </p>

<p>Two other issues have prompted reconsideration of Federal
policy on needle exchange: (1) the magnitude of the HIV epidemic
among IDUs and the related epidemics among their sex partners and
newborns in many areas of this country and (2) the limitations of
alternative intervention options to prevent drug-related HIV
transmission (e.g., limited capacity of drug treatment available
to IDUs and limitations of bleach disinfection of injection
equipment). Based on these observations and the weight of data
presented in the UC report, we believe that the benefits of NEPs
as a component of a comprehensive HIV prevention program for drug
users exceed the theoretical risks of such programs. We conclude
that the ban on Federal funding of NEPs should be lifted to allow
communities and States to use Federal funds to support NEPs as
components of comprehensive HIV prevention programs. We recommend
that NEPs receiving Federal funds be linked to substance abuse
treatment programs and other HIV prevention services. We also
recommend that such programs be required to include evaluation
components to validate their effectiveness. </p>

<p>Increasing the ability of IDUs to obtain and possess sterile
needles and syringes should decrease HIV transmission for those
who will not or cannot stop injecting drugs. Therefore, we also
recommend that States consider the repeal of laws requiring a
physician's prescription to buy needles and syringes and the
removal of criminal penalities[sic] for the possession of needles
and syringes, while maintaining the criminal penalties on other
drug use equipment. Additional evaluation of these interventions
is crucial. </p>

<p>3. BACKGROUND </p>

<p>The substantial role of injection drug use in the HIV/AIDS
epidemic </p>

<p>One-third of reported U.S. AIDS cases are related directly or
indirectly to injection drug use[1]. A disproportionate number of
AIDS cases among people of color in the United States is related
to infection drug use. In 1992, almost half of all AIDS cases
reported among African Americans (49 percent) and Hispanics (48
percent) were directly or indirectly related to injection drug
use. </p>

<p>The majority of reported AIDS cases among women and children
in the United States are related to injection drug use. Among
adult and adolescent women reported with AIDS in this country,
nearly three-quarters (71 percent) were directly or indirectly
related to injection drug use; 50 percent of women with AIDS
reported injecting drugs and an additional 21 percent reported
sexual contact with a male who injected drugs. Two-thirds (66
percent) of children with perinatally acquired AIDS had mothers
who reported injecting drugs themselves and/or having sex with an
IDU. </p>

<p>Preventing HIV/AIDS associated with injection drug use </p>

<p>Use of drug injection equipment (especially needles and
syringes) by more than one person (often called
&quot;sharing&quot; or &quot;multiperson use&quot;) is the
primary mechanism for the spread of HIV related to injection drug
use. Sexual transmission among IDUs also occurs. Several cultural
and social factors are associated with the multiperson use of
needles and syringes and other injection equipment. However,
legal restrictions on the purchasing and possession of needles
and syringes by IDUs are central factors in the multiperson use
of needles and syringes. IDUs' access to and legal ability to
possess sterile needles and syringes are limited by a variety of
State and Federal laws, including (1) prescription laws[2], (2)
drug paraphernalia laws[3], and (3) the </p>

<p>[1]AIDS cases associated with injection drug use include AIDS
cases among a) heterosexual men and all women who report
injecting drugs, b) men who have sex with men who also inject
drugs, c) men and women who do not inject drugs but have
heterosexual relations with drug injectors, and d) newborn
children whose mothers inject drugs or have sex with male drug
injectors. </p>

<p>[2]A State law that requires a physician's prescription as a
condition for sale of needles and syringes in pharmacies (in 10
States and the District of Columbia}. </p>

<p>Federal Mail Order Drug Paraphernalia Control Act[4]. In
States without prescription laws, the selective refusal of some
pharmacists to sell needles and syringes to persons who might be
IDUs is an additional barrier. </p>

<p>In its July 1991 report on &quot;The Twin Epidemics of
Substance Use and HIV, n the National Commission on AIDS
recommended: &quot;Remove legal barriers to the purchase and
possession of injection equipment. Such legal barriers... limit
the availability of new/clean injection equipment and therefore
encourage the sharing of injection equipment, and the increase in
HIV transmission. </p>

<p>Prevention and treatment for drug dependency and addiction are
important HIV prevention strategies. However, only 10 to 20
percent of all drug users are in drug treatment programs at any
given time. Drug treatment capacity is not expected to increase
substantially in the near future, and the capacity will remain
smaller than that required to provide drug treatment for all who
need it and are willing to start. In addition, a substantial
proportion of IDUs are unable or unwilling to stop injecting
drugs and start drug treatment. </p>

<p>Outreach programs are another component of HIV prevention for
IDUs. In addition to providing condoms and advising drug users to
start drug treatment and to decrease drug use, since the
mid-1980s, outreach workers have advocated the use of household
bleach to disinfect drug-injection equipment (particularly
needles and syringes). In April 1993, the CDC, the Center for
Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT) of SAMHSA, and the National
Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) of NIH issued an HIV Prevention
Bulletin describing the limitations of bleach disinfection of
needles and syringes and indicating that (1) sterile, never-used
needles-and syringes are-safer than bleach-disinfected,
previously used needles and syringes and (2) bleach disinfection
is useful only when there is no other safer option. In this
statement, Public Health Service (PHS) agencies clearly pointed
out the limitations of one of the few HIV risk-reduction
interventions for IDUs who share needles and syringes. </p>

<p>[3]A State (or local) law that places criminal penalties on
the possession and distribution of needles and syringes and other
equipment used in the consumption or manufacture of drugs (in 46
States and the District of Columbia. </p>

<p>[4]The Act includes needles and syringes in the list of drug
paraphernalia that cannot be transported by the U.S. Postal
Service or any other means of interstate conveyance. </p>

<p>4. LEGAL RESTRICTIONS OF FEDERAL FUNDING OF NEEDLE EXCHANGE
PROGRAMS IS THE UNITED STATES </p>

<p>Congress has included provisions in at least six laws
restricting the use of Federal funds for NEPs. For example, the
FY 1994 Appropriations Act for the Department states that
&quot;no funds appropriated under this Act shall be used to carry
out any program of distribution of sterile needles for hypodermic
injection of any illegal drug, unless the Surgeon General of the
United States determines that such programs are effective in
preventing the spread of HIV and do not encourage the use of
illegal drugs, except that such funds may be used for such
purposes in furtherance of demonstrations or studies authorized
in the ADAMHA Reorganization Act (Public Law 102-321).&quot; </p>

<p>5. THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA REPORT (&quot;THE PUBLIC
HEALTH IMPACT OF NEEDLE EXCHANGE PROGRAMS IN THE UNITED STATES
AND ABROAD&quot;) </p>

<p>This project was carried out by a team of researchers at the
School of Public Health of the University of California,
Berkeley, and the Institute for Health Policy Studies at the
University of-California, San Francisco. The study began in April
1992 and was supported by funds from the CDC through a
cooperative agreement with the Association of Schools of Public
Health. </p>

<p>The project staff gathered nearly 2,000 &quot;data
sources,&quot; including journal articles (475), conference
abstracts (381), reports (236), and unpublished materials (159).
Between May and September 1992, the team carried out site visits
to 15 cities (10 in the United States, -3-in Canada, and 2 in
Europe). During these site visits, structured observations of 33
needle exchange sessions were made. In addition, 110 key
informants (including NEP staff, public health officials, and
community leaders supporting and opposing the NEP) were
interviewed, and 18 focus groups of clients and non-clients of
the-NEPs (12-9 IDUs ~ participated in the focus groups or
individual interviews) were held by the UC project staff. UC
project staff obtained extensive information on the budgets of
the NEPs visited. To obtain a more complete picture of the NEPs
in the United States, the project staff conducted a postal survey
of 20 NEPs not visited. </p>

<p>The major findings of the UC study are presented in a Summary,
Conclusion, and Recommendations document (43 pages). The detailed
analysis and findings of the UC study are presented in Volume One
(519 pages). Volume Two, a city-by-city description of NEP
activities and related information from the site visits to nine
U.S. and three Canadian cities, will be available in late
December 1993. </p>

<p>Drafts of all chapters of the UC report were reviewed by a
distinguished panel of expert reviewers representing a range of
opinions on needle exchange (Dr. Mindy Fullilove, Dr. Don Des
Jarlais, Dr. Ed Kaplan, Dr. Herbert Kleber, Dr. Douglas Owens,
Dr. Beny Primm, and Ms. Beth Weinstein). </p>

<p>The UC teas used stringent scientific standards in its
analysis and interpretation of the collected published and
unpublished studies on NEPs and needle and syringe availability.
The UC report is the most extensive and comprehensive study of
needle exchange ever published. </p>

<p>6. NEEDLE EXCHANGE PROGRAMS IN THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA </p>

<p>The information in this section on NEPs in the United States
and Canada is derived from the UC report. </p>

<p>The first NEP to provide comprehensive services in the United
States opened in 1988 in Tacoma, Washington. As of September 1,
1993, there were at least 37 NEPs operating in 30 cities in 12
States. By June 1993, more than 5.4 million syringes had been
distributed (almost always in exchange for used syringes) by NEPs
in the United States. In calendar year 1992, U.S. NEPs
distributed more than 2.4 million syringes. </p>

<p>Needle exchange has provoked intense political debate at the
national level and in some States (e.g., California, New York)
and cities (e.g., Baltimore, New York City, Boston, Berkeley).
Nonetheless, in many cities (e.g., Seattle, Tacoma, San
Francisco, Honolulu,- New Haven), large-scale NEPs have been
established with substantial community support. In New York City,
after years of intense political debate, five NEPs were legally
opened in 1992 and now distribute about one million syringes a
year. The UC team collected U.S. public opinion polls that-at-
included questions regarding needle availability needle cleaning.
These public opinion polls indicate that approximately half of
the general public has supported harm reduction efforts,
including needle cleaning, legalization of needles sales, needle
exchange, and needle distribution. While this public support has
tended to increase over time and has been somewhat higher for
needle exchange than for needle distribution, needle exchange
remains a controversial issue. </p>

<p>Substantial variations exist among U.S. NEPs in legal status,
administrative structure, and sources of funding. Nineteen U.S.
NEPs are &quot;legal,&quot;[5] eight are
&quot;illegal-tolerated,&quot;[6] and six are
&quot;illegal-underground.&quot;[7] Six U.S. NEPs are
administered by State or local governments, six by
community-based organizations (CBOs with government sponsorship,
eight by CBOs without government sponsorship, and thirteen by
what the UC report called &quot;activist&quot; organizations.
Private donations are a major source of funding at 19 U.S. NEPs,
more than any other source of funding. Fourteen NEPs are
financially supported by foundation grants, 12 by funds from a
CBO and/or activist organization administering the NEP, 12 by
city or county government, and 4 by State governments. Fifteen
U.S. NEPs depend entirely on volunteer staff, and all but seven
NEPs use volunteers. Twenty-seven of 33 U.S. NEPs surveyed or
visited have &quot;one-for-one rules&quot; (one sterile syringe
is given out for each syringe turned in). Seventeen NEPs provide
'starter needles&quot; (one or more [usually three] syringes
provided to new NEP clients without requiring turn-in of used
syringes). Ten NEPs have limits on the number of syringes that
can be exchanged. Rules governing the exchange procedures are
generally well enforced. </p>

<p>U.S. NEPs serve ethnically diverse IDU populations that
generally reflect local ethnic and racial patterns. The mean age
of U.S. NEP clients ranges from 33-41 years with a mean duration
of drug injection ranging from 7-20 years. NEPs successfully
reach IDUs who are not enrolled in drug treatment, with studies
in the United States reporting one-third to one-half of NEP
clients having no prior exposure to drug treatment. NEP clients
are at significant risk for drug-related HIV transmission with 10
to 60 percent reporting some needle sharing and about one-third
reported sharing needles in the month preceding interview. </p>

<p>U.S. NEPs are reaching thousands of IDUs in the 30 cities in
which they operate. In addition to needle exchange, a variety of
public health services are provided on site or are available by
referral, including drug treatment, HIV counseling and testing,
primary medical care, tuberculosis and sexually transmitted
disease screening and treatment, and social services. The UC team
found that among NEPs visited with data on these activities, six
NEPs had referred more than 2,000 drug users to drug treatment
and that more than 800 drug users had started drug treatment
after referral by four NEPs. </p>

<p>[5]An NEP in a State that does not have a prescription law or
an NEP that has a specific exemption to the prescription law. </p>

<p>[6]In a state with a prescription law, an NEP which a locally
elected body (e.g., city council) has voted to support or
approve. </p>

<p>[7]In a State with a prescription law, an illegal-underground
NEP which has not been supported by a locally elected body. </p>

<p>The median annual budget of U.S. and Canadian needle exchange
programs visited is relatively low at 5169,000, with government
run programs tending to have larger budgets. Some NEPs are more
expensive because they also provide substantial additional
services such as drug treatment referrals. </p>

<p>The UC team extensively reviewed the previously published
mathematical models that estimated the impact of NEPs on HIV
transmission, and developed additional models of the
effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of NEPs in the United
States. These efforts, in agreement with other independent
reviews (e.g., the General Accounting Office [GAO] review),
confirmed the theoretical and technical validity of the model
used to estimate the impact of the New Haven NEP. Applied to
other cities, a simplified version of this model predicted
reductions ranging from 17 to 70 percent in new drug-related HIV
infections among NEP clients. In one of the cities, the estimated
cost-per-HIV-infection-averted by NEPs was between S3,700 and
$12,000. These estimated costs of preventing an HIV infection
compare very favorably with the costs of other lifesaving
programs and are much less than the present value of the lifetime
costs of medical care for a person with HIV infection ($119,000)
. </p>

<p>The UC report also reviews the development of NEPs in Canada,
where the federal government provided leadership and initial
funding (requiring provincial matching funds) for HIV prevention
programs for drug users, including NEPs. In Canada all NEPs are
legal, and there has been very limited community or professional
opposition to the NEPs. Since the first Canadian NEPs were opened
in 1989, the number of cities with active NEPs has steadily
increased to a total of 28 cities in early 1993. More than 2.5
million syringes were distributed through December 1992 by the
five Canadian NEPs visited by the UC team. </p>

<p>7. IMPACT OF NEEDLE EXCHANGE PROGRAMS ON DRUG USE </p>

<p>Accurate measurement of drug use patterns and numbers of drug
users in communities is technically very challenging, in part
because drug use is-an illegal activity. Therefore-, it is
extremely difficult to quantitatively assess the impact of NEPs
on community drug use. </p>

<p>The UC report provides data on both the behavior of NEP
clients and community measures of drug use. The UC report clearly
documents that substantial numbers of IDUs (both clients and
non-clients of the NEP) have been referred to drug treatment
programs, a substantial step in reducing drug use by those
individuals and in the community. The UC report presents the
results of 26 evaluations in the United States and abroad that
provide information on changes in drug-risk behavior among IDUs
who were using NEPs; 16 of the 26 were judged to be of acceptable
scientific quality. Although not definitive, the majority of
these studies found that drug-related risk behaviors for HIV
transmission were significantly reduced among NEP clients. </p>

<p>In addition, the UC team reviewed national drug use indicators
and the findings of IDU focus groups. The limited data for U.S.
cities with NEPs from the Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN), Drug
Use Forecasting (DUF) system, and Uniform Crime Reports do not
show clear trends in patterns of drug use in those cities with
NEPs. The IDU focus groups conducted in cities with NEPs
consistently indicated that the participants believed that NEPs
would have little effect on drug use in the community. </p>

<p>We agree with the UC team conclusion that available data are
quite limited but provide no evidence of any NEP-related
increases in community levels of drug use. However, the
limitations of both available research methods and existing data
addressing this issue underline the need for continuing
evaluation and research on the impact of NEPs on drug use.
Additional evaluation and research and the development of new
research methods in this area should be a component of Federally
supported NEPs. </p>

<p>A key concern of NEP opponents is that these programs will
directly or indirectly increase drug use. Opponents view NEPs as
directly increasing drug use by providing the means (needles and
syringes) to inject drugs. They also see NEPs as indirectly
promoting drug use by appearing to condone and facilitate drug
use and thereby undermining the credibility of society's message
that using drugs is illegal, unhealthy and morally wrong.
However, no study in the United States or abroad was found that
showed that NEPs increase community drug use. </p>

<p>8. IMPACT OF NEEDLE EXCHANGE PROGRAMS ON PREVENTING HIV
INFECTION </p>

<p>A major question in the policy debate over NEPs is their
effectiveness in preventing-HIV infection among IDU-s-and-their
contacts. Several findings strongly support the conclusion that
NEPs reduce HIV transmission. First, the process of needle
exchange removes used, often HIV-contaminated, needles and
syringes from the hands of IDUs and replaces them with sterile
needles and syringes. Second, NEPs are often effective in
referring NEP client and non-client IDUs to drug treatment
programs. Third, NEP clients report decreases in their HIV drug
risk behaviors. Fourth, mathematical models of the impact of NEPs
in New Haven and other cities consistently estimate substantial
reductions (ranging from 17 to 70 percent) in HIV transmission
for the IDUs using NEPs and their sex partners and children.
Fifth, there is some evidence that hepatitis B infection is
reduced by NEPs. On the other hand, epidemiologic studies which
directly address HIV prevalence and incidence in relation to NEPs
have been methodologically weak. One case-control study (in
Amsterdam) found no protective effect of the NEP on HIV
seroconversion among IDUs. However, the Amsterdam study was not
primarily designed to test NEP effectiveness and included only a
limited number (31) of new HIV infections. We concur with the UC
conclusion that the relationship between NEPs and HIV infection
may be very difficult to determine conclusively. </p>

<p>9. REVIEW OF UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA RECOMMENDATIONS </p>

<p>In this section, the recommendations of the UC study are
reviewed. </p>

<p>&quot;Recommendations for the federal government </p>

<p>The federal government should repeal the ban on the use of
federal funds for needle exchange services. </p>

<p>Substantial federal funds should be committed both to
providing needle exchange services and to expanding research into
these programs. </p>

<p>CDC comment: </p>

<p>Both recommendations are reasonable and appropriate with the
minor modifications indicated in this section. </p>

<p>Given the significance of injection drug use in HIV
transmission in the United States, it is important to implement
NEPs as one possible component of comprehensive HIV prevention
programs for drug users. Comprehensive programs should include
increases in drug treatment, street and community outreach to
drug users, and effective school and community-based programs to
prevent initiation of drug use. The ban on Federal funding of
NEP-s should be removed-to allow States-and-communities the
option of including NEPs in comprehensive programs. NEPs will be
more readily integrated into comprehensive programs when there is
evidence of substantial local support for NEPs as indicated by
any of the following: requests for an NEP from a State or local
HIV community planning process; substantial funding for NEPs from
local and/or State government or nongovernmental organizations;
and efforts to reform the laws limiting the sale or possession of
needles and syringes. </p>

<p>The PHS should fund additional evaluations of NEPs[8] to
gather more data on the impact of these programs and to assess
the relative effectiveness of various models of delivery of NEP
services. Additional research is needed on the initiation of drug
use and drug injection and changes in community drug use,
particularly in communities with high prevalence of drug use, as
they relate to NEPs and other interventions that increase the
availability of sterile needles and syringes. PHS agencies
supporting research on NEPs should develop and promote the use of
standardized data elements, methods of data collection, and
protocols for evaluation and analysis. </p>

<p>State governments in the ten states and the District of
Columbia that have prescription laws should repeal these laws. </p>

<p>- States should repeal the paraphernalia laws as they apply to
syringes. </p>

<p>CDC comment: </p>

<p>Both recommendations are reasonable and appropriate with the
modifications indicated in this section. </p>

<p>Although the major focus of the UC report was NEPs, there is
ample evidence of the importance of allowing access to sterile
needles and syringes for drug users who will not or cannot stop
injecting drugs. In the United States and other countries,
difficulty in obtaining and/or possessing needles and syringes
contributes to multiperson use of needles and syringes and
thereby to HIV transmission. NEPs can provide only a part of the
increased access to needles and syringes that is needed to
prevent HIV infection in IDUs, their sex partners and children.
Changing the prescription and paraphernalia laws would increase
IDU access to sterile needles and syringes with little or no
expenditure of public funds. </p>

<p>An ongoing CDC and Connecticut evaluation of 1992 changes in
the prescription and drug paraphernalia laws in Connecticut[9]
provides convincing evidence of the potential benefit of these
recommendations. The evaluation found (1) steady increases of
&quot;non-prescription&quot; purchases of needles and syringes
from pharmacies, (2) that IDUs reported their primary source of
needles and syringes shifted from street/black-market purchases
to pharmacy purchases and (3) that sharing (&quot;multiperson
use&quot;) of needles and syringes decreased from 52 percent
prior to the new laws to 32 percent 8 to 12 months after the new
laws were implemented. Similar increases in pharmacy purchases
and decreases in sharing of needles and syringes were found in
France after a prescription law was repealed in 1987. </p>

<p>[9]In 1992, Connecticut removed all criminal penalties for (a)
the sale, without a prescription, of up to 10 needles and
syringes and (b) the possession of up to 10 needles and syringes.
</p>

<p>The implementation of these recommendations is primarily the
responsibility of State governments. We recommend that the
Federal government and others support strong evaluation studies
of the impact of changes in these laws on drug use patterns and
HIV transmission risk behaviors. The use of standardized research
methods yielding comparable results should be encouraged. </p>

<p>&quot;Recommendations for local governments and communities </p>

<p>Local governments should enter into discussions with local
community groups to develop a comprehensive approach to
preventing HIV in injection drug users. their sex partners. and
their offspring. This approach should include needle exchange
programs and the expansion of drug treatment services. </p>

<p>Local communities should seek to further increase sterile
syringe availability by encouraging the sale, distribution. or
exchange of syringes by pharmacists.&quot; </p>

<p>CDC comment: </p>

<p>Both recommendations are reasonable and appropriate. </p>

<p>The experience with implementing NEPs in the United States and
other countries indicates that NEPs are better accepted and
operate more efficiently when there is extensive community
involvement in planning how the NEP services will be provided.
NEPs should be components of comprehensive, multifaceted HIV
prevention programs for IDUs. </p>

<p>Pharmacy sale of sterile needles and syringes is-an--important
component in increasing the availability of sterile injection
equipment to IDUs. Retail pharmacies could provide widespread
access to sterile needles and syringes, especially in areas where
NEPs would be impractical (e.g., rural areas). Pharmacists are
important &quot;gate keepers&quot; for the availability of
sterile needles and syringes. Many pharmacists will need training
to realize the importance of their public health role in helping
ensure the availability of sterile needles and syringes to IDUs. </p>

<p>10 . INCREASING THE AVAILABILITY OF STERILE NEEDLES AND
SYRINGES </p>

<p>CDC believes that increasing the availability of sterile
needles and syringes is appropriate Federal policy for the
following reasons: </p>

<p>(1) HIV transmission associated with injection drug use is a
major contributor to the growth of the current AIDS epidemic in
the United States. Injection-related HIV transmission has caused
increases in the number of AIDS cases among women and children,
in heterosexually acquired HIV infections and in cases of
tuberculosis. </p>

<p>(2) Restrictions on access to and the possession of needles
and syringes increase the multiperson use (&quot;sharing&quot;)
of drug injection equipment that transmits HIV. </p>

<p>(3) A recent bulletin from the CDC, NIDA, and CSAT indicates
that bleach disinfection of used drug injection equipment is not
as safe as using sterile needles and syringes. Such disinfection
is recommended only when sterile needles and syringes are not
available. </p>

<p>(4) Evaluation of NEPs in the United States and other
countries indicates that these programs can provide services to
large numbers of IDUs, remove millions of used needles and
syringes from circulation, and increase access to drug treatment
and other high priority public health services. </p>

<p>(5) The preponderance of evidence indicates that NEPs diminish
HIV transmission without increasing drug use. </p>

<p>(6) Evaluation of changes in the prescription and drug
paraphernalia laws in Connecticut indicates that drug users
change their usual source of needles and syringes from street and
&quot;black market&quot; purchases to purchases -from pharmacies
and substantially decrease sharing of injection equipment. </p>

<p>We recommend that the PHS adopt a policy goal of increasing
the availability of sterile needles and syringes for IDUs. This
specific HIV prevention strategy would be one component of
comprehensive, multifaceted HIV prevention programs for IDUs. The
following activities should be considered to implement this
policy: </p>

<p>Allow Federal funding of NEPs, especially when these NEPs
would also provide their clients with access to HIV counseling
and other priority public health programs (e.g., drug treatment
and tuberculosis screening and treatment). Programs that receive
Federal funding should have substantial evaluation and/or
research components, either as part of the project or as a
separately funded activity. </p>

<p>Continue funding for research and evaluation studies of the
impact of NEPs on HIV risk behaviors and HIV infection. </p>

<p>(1) the repeal of State laws requiring a physician's
prescription for the purchase of sterile needles and syringes,
(2) the repeal of State and municipal laws and regulations making
the possession of needles and syringes a crime, and 3) the
removal of needles and syringes from the list of materials
covered by the Federal Mail Order Drug Paraphernalia Control Act.
Evaluations of the impact of these changes should be funded </p>

<p>Work with the professional associations of pharmacists and
pharmacies to develop policies that increase the pharmacy-based
availability of sterile needles and syringes. </p>

<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY </p>

<p>THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA REPORT (THE PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACT
OF NEEDLE EXCHANGE PROGRAMS IN THE UNITED STATES AND ABROAD </p>

<p>CONCLUSIONS </p>

<p>How and Why did Needle Exchange Programs Develop? </p>

<p>Needle exchange programs have continued to increase in number
in the U.S. and by September 1, 1993 at least 37 active programs
exist. The evolution of needle exchange programs in the U.S. has
been characterized by growing efforts to accommodate the concerns
of local communities. increasing likelihood of being legal,
growing institutionalization, and increasing federal funding of
research, although a ban on federal funding for program services
remains in effect. </p>

<p>How do Needle Exchange Programs Operate? </p>

<p>About one-half of U.S. needle exchange programs are legal, but
funding is often unstable and most programs rely on volunteer
services to operate. All but six U.S. needle exchange programs
require one-for-one exchanges and rules governing the) exchange
of syringes are generally well enforced. In addition to having
distributed over 5.4 million syringes, U.S. needle exchange
programs provide a variety of services ranging from condom and
bleach distribution to drug treatment referrals. </p>

<p>Do Needle Exchange Programs Act as Bridges to Public Health
Services? </p>

<p>Some needle exchange programs have made significant numbers of
referrals to drug abuse treatment and other public health
services, but referrals are limited by the paucity of drug
treatment slots. Integrating needle exchange programs into the
existing public health system is a likely future direction for
these programs. </p>

<p>How Much Does It Cost to Operate Needle Exchange Programs? </p>

<p>The median annual budget of U.S. and Canadian needle exchange
programs visited is relatively low at $169,000, with
government-run programs tending to be more expensive. Some needle
exchange programs are more expensive because they also provide
substantial non-exchange services such as drug treatment
referrals. The annual cost of funding an average needle exchange
program would support about 60 methadone maintenance slots for
one year. </p>

<p>Who Are the IDUs who Use Needle Exchange Programs? </p>

<p>Although needle exchange program clients vary from location to
location, the programs generally reach a group of injection drug
users with long histories of drug injection who remain at
significant risk for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
infection. Needle exchange program clients in the U.S. have had
less exposure to drug abuse treatment than IDUs not using the
programs. </p>

<p>What Proportion of All Injection Drug Users in a Community
Uses the Needle Exchange Program? </p>

<p>Studies of adequately-funded needle exchange programs suggest
that the programs do have the potential to serve significant
proportions of the local injecting drug user population. While
some needle exchange programs appear to have reached large
proportions of local drug injectors at least once, others are
reaching only a small fraction of them. Consequently other
methods of increasing sterile needle availability must be
explored. </p>

<p>What Are the Community Responses to Needle Exchange Programs? </p>

<p>Unlike in many foreign countries, including Canada, proposals
to establish needle exchange programs in the U.S. have often
encountered strong opposition from a variety of different
communities. Consultation with affected communities can address
many of the concerns raised. </p>

<p>Do Needle Exchange Programs Result in Changes in Community
Levels of Drug Use? </p>

<p>Although quantitative data are difficult to-obtain, those
available provide no evidence that--needle exchange programs
increase the amount of drug use by needle exchange program
clients or change overall community levels of non injection and
injection drug use. This conclusion is supported by interviews
with needle exchange program clients and by injecting drug users
not using the programs who did not believe that increased needle
availability would increase drug use. </p>

<p>Do Needle Exchange Programs Affect the Number of Discarded
Syringes? </p>

<p>Needle exchange programs in the U.S. have not been shown to
increase the total number of discarded syringes and can be
expected to result in fewer discarded syringes. </p>

<p>Do Needle Exchange Programs Affect Rates of HIV drug and/or
Sex Risk Behaviors? </p>

<p>The majority of studies of needle exchange program clients
demonstrate decreased ratios of HIV drug risk behavior, but not
decreased ratios of HIV sex risk behavior. </p>

<p>What is the Role of Studies of Syringes in injection Drug Use
Research? </p>

<p>The limitations of using the testing of syringes-as a measure
of injecting drug users' behavior or behavior change can be
minimized by following syringe characteristics over time,. or by
comparing characteristics of syringes returned by needle exchange
program clients with those obtained from non-clients of the
program. </p>

<p>Do Needle Exchange Programs Affect Rates of Diseases Related
to Injection Drug Use Other than HIV? </p>

<p>Studies of the effect of needle exchange programs on
injection-related infectious diseases other than HIV provide
limited evidence that needle exchange programs are associated
with reductions in subcutaneous abscesses and hepatitis B among
injecting drug users. </p>

<p>Do Needle Exchange Programs Affect HIV Infection Rates? </p>

<p>Studies of the effect of needle exchange programs on HIV
infection rates do not and, in part due to the need for large
sample sizes and the multiple impediments to randomization,
probably cannot provide clear evidence that needle exchange
programs decrease HIV infection rates. However, needle exchange
programs do not appear to be associated with increased rates of
HIV infection. </p>

<p>Are Needle Exchange Programs Cost-effective in Preventing HIV
Infection? </p>

<p>Multiple mathematical models of needle exchange program impact
support the findings of the New Haven Model. These models suggest
that needle exchange programs can prevent significant numbers of
infections among clients of the programs, their drug an sex
partners, and their children. In almost ail cases, the cost per
HIV infection averted is far below the $119,000 lifetime cost of
treating an HIV-infected person. </p>

<p>RECOMMENDATIONS </p>

<p>Recommendations for the federal government </p>

<p>The federal government should repeal the ban on the use of
federal funds for needle exchange services. </p>

<p>Substantial federal funds should be committed both to
providing needle exchange services and to expanding research into
these programs. </p>

<p>Recommendations for state governments </p>

<p>State governments in the ten states and the District of
Columbia that have prescription laws should repeal these laws.[1]
</p>

<p>States should repeal the paraphernalia laws as they apply to
syringes.[2] </p>

<p>Recommendations for local governments and communities </p>

<p>Local governments should enter into discussions with local
community groups to develop a comprehensive approach to
preventing HIV in injecting drug users, their sex partners, and
their offspring. This approach should include needle exchange
programs and the expansion of drug treatment services </p>

<p>Local communities should seek to further increase sterile
syringe availability by encouraging the sale, distribution, or
exchange of syringes by pharmacists. </p>

<p>Recommendations for researchers </p>

<p>Descriptions of the &quot;kinetics&quot; and determinants of
needle use patterns: injection drug users sources of needles.
methods of disposal of needles, frequency of needle re-use, and
needle-sharing patterns. How do these change when a needle
exchange program or other changes in needle availability are
implemented? </p>

<p>Evaluations of &quot;natural experiments&quot; in which needle
availability laws </p>

<p>pharmacy based syringe sale, distribution, or exchange and to
identify the barriers to their participation. </p>

<p>Assessments of the effects of design features of needle
exchange programs (e.g., administering bodies, site
characteristics, opening hours, and program rules} upon process
measures of needle exchange programs (e.g., needles distributed,
drug treatment referrals discarding of needles). </p>

<p>Ethnographic and other qualitative research to assess the
factors involved in drug use initiation and in transitions
between various routes of drug use. </p>

<p>Case-control studies of the relationship between use of the
needle exchange program and acute hepatitis 8, particularly in
cities with active surveillance for the infection. </p>

<p>Large, multi-center case-control studies within existing
cohorts of injecting drug users to assess whether use of the
needle exchange program is associated with hepatitis B or HIV
seroconversion </p>

<p>Mathematical modeling using program data and behavior change
evaluations to determine which aspects of program design
determine effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. </p>

<p>[1]Prescription laws preclude the purchase of a syringe
without a prescription. limiting sterile syringe availability and
creating a risk of arrest for needle exchange program staff and
clients. </p>

<p>[2]Paraphernalia laws exist in 46 states and the District of
Columbia and preclude the possession or distribution or syringes
except for legitimate medical purposes. Conviction under a
paraphernalia law is a felony or a misdemeanor </p>

<p>Subject: Comments on the CDC's Draft Response on Needle
Exchange </p>

<p>We have reviewed the draft CDC response to the Office of the
Assistant Secretary for Health and the Surgeon General regarding
the University of California report on needle exchange. In
addition to the comments provided in our earlier review of the
report (included as Tab B in the CDC draft response), we provide
the following comments that are specific to the draft CDC
response letter: </p>

<p>1. Agency Position Issue </p>

<p>Page 1: The second paragraph implies that the NIH, along with
SAMHSA, HRSA, and the FDA, has provided &quot;recommendation for
needle exchange.&quot; This is either inaccurate or misleading.
We suggest that the wording &quot;And recommendations for needle
exchange&quot; be dropped from the sentence. </p>

<p>2. Research </p>

<p>The CDC draft response appropriately includes an emphasis on
the need for increasing research and evaluation of needle
exchange programs (NEPs) and other related aspects of HIV and
drug abuse. </p>

<p>However, in light of the reported gaps in information
concerning the efficacy and impact of needle exchange programs,
requiring evaluation to be an integral component of any federally
funded NEP becomes critical if we are to take an iterative
approach to this issue. </p>

<p>The following text changes are recommended: </p>

<p>Page 2: In the last sentence of the second paragraph the word
&quot;include&quot; should be change (sic) to
&quot;require&quot;; </p>

<p>Page 11: The first sentence of the last paragraph should be
&quot;The PHS should require substantial evaluation be part of
any federally funded NEP so as to continue to gather more data on
the impact...&quot;; and, </p>

<p>Page 15: The last sentence of the first paragraph should be
changed to read, &quot;Programs that receive Federal funding
should be required to have substantial evaluation and/or research
components, either as part of the project or as a separately
funded activity.&quot; </p>

<p>3. Agency Designation </p>

<p>Page 4: The fourth paragraph lists the CDC, CSAT and NIDA as
co-sponsors of a bleach use guidance. For parity , all agencies
should be designated. This could be achieved by indicating
CSAT/SAMHSA and NIDA/NIH, or by stating, &quot; The National
Institute on Drug Abuse, part of the National Institutes of
Health,...&quot; </p>

<p>Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions of
need further information. </p>

<p>SUBJECT: NIH comments on- the University of California Report,
</p>

<p>&quot; Public Health Impact of Needle Exchange Programs in the
United States and Abroad. &quot; </p>

<p>We have reviewed the report, &quot;The Public Health Impact of
Needle Exchange Programs in the United states and Abroad, &quot;
from a research perspective, We have provided several points for
your consideration in your response on needle exchange to the
Assistant Secretary for Health: </p>

<p>1. This report is a good initial analysis of this issue and
serves as a useful starting point for further examination; </p>

<p>2. Utilizing needle/syringe exchange (NSE) programs as an HIV
prevention strategy is a complex issue. The current state of the
science with respect to this issue is neither complete nor
comprehensive, .requiring further study on this, as well as,
alternative behavioral interventions; </p>

<p>2. There are a number of significant issues and problems with
respect to needle exchange program that the data available to the
University of California have not addressed (see attached
analysis); </p>

<p>3. The report appropriately suggests a substantial federal
commitment to research in this area. Such support should include,
but should not be limited to, .funding for: 1) building
substantiai evaluation and/or research components into existing
NSEs; 2) research demonstration projects that address NSE
program: design issues; 3. research on other forms of
need~e/syringe distribution (e.g., pharmacy or vending machinP
strategies); and, 4) research on the relationships and impact of
NSEs on other prevention strategies (e.g., bleach use) and other
non-injecting at-risk populations (e.g., non-injecting drug users
who trade sex or money for drugs). In addition, until more is
definitively known and has been time tested, any NSE service
programs funded should have appropriate research and/or
evaluation components built into them as a prerequisite for
Federal funding. </p>

<p>For a more detailed analysis of the specific research issues
and questions that remain unanswered by the report, we have
attached comments on the report provided by the National
Institute on Drug Abuse. </p>

<p>Topic: Comments on University of California Report, &quot; The
Public Health Impact of Needle Exchange Programs in the United
States and Abroad&quot; </p>

<p>In general, medical/public health interventions, like
medications, may be evaluated within a framework that examines
safety, efficacy, side effects, deleterious effects and both
positive and negative interactions with other treatments or
conditions. With respect to any of the effects, questions include
what subpopulations are likely to experience the effect and how
long it is likely to last, including recommendations with respect
to the length of treatment. In fact, to the degree to which this
Report provides the equivalent of a section of the Physician's
Desk Reference(PDR) devoted to needle/syringe exchange (NSE) it
will be helpful all who are concerned with the implications of
NSEs. </p>

<p>Viewing this Report in the aforementioned framework it becomes
clear that with respect to overall &quot;effects&quot; NSE is
associated in the aggregate with reductions in self reports of
needle-related HIV risk behavior. </p>

<p>However, a major problem with the existing data examined by
the Report is the lack of sensitivity of the data to detection of
adverse effects of NSE on individuals or subpopulations and
interaction with, for example, the various modalities of drug
abuse treatment. There is no equivalent of studies that search
for individuals who purport to have experienced &quot;adverse
reactions&quot; or negative consequences or interactions that may
be attributable to participation in NSE. It is questionable
whether in the context of medications development the Federal
Government would approve and/or provide funds for a medication
for which this type of data were not available. </p>

<p>In the spirit of seeking the information that would be needed
for a complete PDR section on needle/syringe exchange, we will
review some concerns about the potential adverse impact and
interactions of NSE. </p>

<p>One major concern of critics of NSEs as an AIDS intervention
effort is the degree to which the availability of sterile
needles/syringes would server to promote drug use. While the
needle exchange studies reported from around the world from the
last two world AIDS conferences do not, and perhaps cannot, prove
that the presence and/or use of a needle exchange does not
increase drug use, there have been no reports that confirm such
an increase. However, there are a number of direct and indirect
ways in which drug use maybe promoted for individuals and
subpopulations that have not been addressed by existing data. For
example, one wonders what happens to the drug use of individuals
who seek drug treatment through an NSE and are told that there is
no slot available for them. </p>

<p>Analogous to that for needle/syringe exchange, the criticism
of the potential for increasing injection drug use was raised for
bleach distribution. This particular criticism (although not all
criticisms) with respect to bleach was, in the aggregate and
within limits, refuted by the results of the National AIDS
Demonstration Research data which is consistent with the model
that when contact is established with drug users, trust is build,
information is imparted and risky behavior is reduced, despite
the fact that safe needle use is also being assisted at the same
time(XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX). Nonetheless, the demonstration of
beneficial effects does not preclude the simultaneous existence
of deleterious effects. </p>

<p>NSEs may not be uniformly effective in acting as a bridge to
other public health services, depending on such factors as to
what degree the services are &quot;on-site&quot; versus
&quot;remote&quot; as well as &quot;immediately available&quot;
versus &quot;requiring waiting&quot;. Studies of the service
linkage process suggest that higher rates of successful
engagement with other services will be attained for those
services that are on-site and immediately available. It would be
useful to attempt to characterize users and non-users of
additional services and to delineate those factors that affect
these decisions. </p>

<p>Inconsistent of infrequent users of the NSEs may remain and be
stabilized at high risk behavior levels. With respect to the
inconsistent or infrequent users of the NSEs, it will be
important to determine the factors influencing periods of use
versus non-user. More over, looking at NSEs as an
&quot;innovation&quot; with respect to injection drug user, the
literature of models of [LINE LOST IN COPYING - Ed.] middle and
late adopters of NSEs may be useful in terms of delineating
populations with distinct patterns of motivations, risk factors
and responses to the NSEs. </p>

<p>Change or lack of change in the micro-structure, i.e.,
details, of behaviors associated with drug use may negate
beneficial effects of NSEs. In looking at drug risk behaviors, it
is important to attempt to assess whether NSEs affect rate of
sharing of cookers, cotton, water, etc. as well as such practices
as frontloading, backloading and booting. With respect to drug
risk behaviors it is thus important to examine NSE effects on
behavioral norms of (1) non-NSE-users and (2) drug using
non-injectors as well as (3) NSE users. </p>

<p>NSE users may sell paraphernalia or exchange it for drugs or
sex. In fact, the possibility should be examined that
non-injectors may use the NSEs as a source for paraphernalia that
may used in transactions with injectors. </p>

<p>The rate at which NSE users (versus NSE non-users) initiate
new injectors and influence other IDUs to utilize or not utilize
the NSE should be examined. Moreover, questions of the influence
of the NSE on injections frequency should be examined closely.
For individuals, the availability of clean paraphernalia may
remove one brake on increasing the frequency of injection. </p>

<p>Certainly, NSE effects on the number of IDUs entering drug
treatment need to be examined. However, the fate of IDUs who have
used the NSE prior to entry into drug treatment should also be
examined. NSE participants or injections drug users whose network
includes NSE participants may relapse to needle use and/or drop
out of drug treatment at a higher rate than NSE non-users. </p>

<p>NSE effects on social network may lead to problems. Since NSEs
imply a high rate of flow of IDUs through the neighborhood
surrounding the site, there may be a tendency for dealers,
operators of shooting galleries and/or crack houses and
prostitutes to relocate to the same area. If possible, these
effects and their implications should be assessed. The potential
effects of NSEs on setting up bridges between networks of IDUs in
high and low HIV seroprevalence neighborhoods should be examined.
If NSEs serve to create such bridges they would, especially
through inconsistent seropositive users, serve as conduits to
facilitate viral spread. If data are generated on local changes
in seroprevcalence and/or seroincidence over time in areas
surrounding NSEs, (including baseline levels prior to the
establishment of the NSE and changes during the growth of the
NSE), then some of these questions may be able to be addressed.
Data pertinent to the perceived effects of participation in the
NSE on the sexual, social and drug-using networks of the
individuals would also be helpful in beginning to address these
hypotheses. </p>

<p>Additional network effects may occur or existing network
effects may be potentiated if NSE sites are located close to drug
treatment programs (methadone or drug free programs), hospitals,
psychiatric facilities, homeless shelters or other facilities
that attract concentrations of individuals who are vulnerable to
initiating drug injections, relapsing to drug use or injections,
having sex with injections users or becoming victims of crime
associated with injections users. </p>

<p>As is addressed in the Report, the surveyed NSEs varied
greatly in along many parameters including estimates of the
proportions of injection drug users reached by the program, the
amount of education offered, the degree to which injection
equipment beyond needles/syringes were distributed, emphasis on
drug treatment referrals, costs, the extent of ongoing
evaluation, acceptance by the local community, legal
acceptance/tolerance, etc. These are major program design and
feasibility that could determine differences between highly
effective programs and those with a substantial negative impact.
Support for grams without consideration of these issues would be
the equivalent of support for all treatment programs in any area
in the absence of standards and quality assurance. </p>

<p>Finally, the interrelationships between NSEs and the use of
bleach need to be examined. For example, we have evidence that
even IDUs who use bleach tend to not use it effectively. Does the
existence of needles from NSEs decrease the probability that IDUs
will even attempt to use bleach if the share? Will they feel that
the needles are at least relatively safer and thus real that
bleach use is not necessary? Does the distribution of bleach
increase the probability that IDUs will share NSE distributed
needles? Are NSEs attempting to intervene in terms of education
with respect to bleach use? </p>

<p>This, of course is not an exhaustive list of questions or
issues, but is meant to represent a set of problems whose
existence has not been addressed by the data available to the
University of California study. </p>

<p>However, even in the absence of Federal Support, NSE is a
growing part of HIV prevention efforts. This Report appropriately
suggests a substantial Federal commitment to research in this
area. With respect to the funding of services, it appears
reasonable, as the Report suggests, that the ban on funding be
lifted. </p>

<p>Nonetheless, it would appear prudent in light of the
incomplete data and the aforementioned set of concerns that no
services e funded that do not included a substantial evaluation
component with appropriate instrumentation and methodologies to
identify adverse as well as beneficial contribution of these
programs to HIV and other infectious disease transmission and
drug use patterns. Perhaps as a prelude to defining standards for
Federal funding of NSE services, there should be funding for
incorporating evaluation in existing NSEs and setting up
research/demonstrations projects that address NSE program design
issues. </p>

<p>Beyond the issue of NSEs per se, the argument is made in this
Report in favor of immediate implementation of the entire variety
of interventions that increase the availability of sterile
needles/syringes, including pharmacy sales and the abolition of
prescription and paraphernalia laws. Given the stated priority of
the objective, presumably this support would extend to other
forms of needle/syringe distribution, e.g., vending machines like
those used in Europe. </p>

<p>While the objective appears reasonable, it would be helpful if
the Report addressed more of the complexities of this issue so
that sterile needle/syringes are not viewed as a &quot;magic
bullet&quot; that obviates the need to continue work on
behavioral interventions. For example, there have been extensive
observations of &quot;secondary sharing&quot; in which addicts in
groups use frontloading and backloading to distribute
&quot;cooked&quot; drugs to their syringes. In these situation if
an addict brings his/her own syringe, but has previously used the
syringe even once and engaged in &quot;booting&quot; (drawing
blood back into the syringe and reinjecting after initial
injection to make sure that any residual drug in the syringe is
used), blood may be distributed to others' syringes. Moreover,
contaminants of &quot;cookers', &quot;cotton&quot; and
&quot;rinse water&quot; may be similarly distributed. </p>

<p>Finally, all strategies for distributing needles/syringes may
not be equivalent. For example, it is questionable whether
pharmacies will provide other forms of injections equipment, HIV
education, HIV testing and counseling, referral to drug treatment
programs, on-site medical car, etc. Similarly, these service
would presumable not be available through such distribution
sources as vending machines. </p>

<p>NOTE TO: George Lewis </p>

<p>RE Comments on Needle Exchange Study </p>

<p>As you may be aware, Beny asked me to review this report
during the early of it's preparation earlier this year. While the
final summary report does reflect many of the changes we
recommended, there are several noteworthy areas which warrant
some attention. </p>

<p>Page 4, Paragraph 4. The report indicates that, &quot;although
NEPs may make referral to drug treatment an important part of
their services, they acknowledge that many IDUs, including some
in drug treatment programs, continue to inject drugs and share
injection equipment. They therefore seek to reduce the harm
associated with these practices...&quot;. While there may be some
injecting drug users in certain treatment modalities who continue
to inject drugs, the reference here implies that this practice
has more significance than the evidence warrants. More
importantly, the statement, in a somewhat convoluted fashion,
implies that referral to treatment in contrast to NEP does not
offer assurance that drug users will not inject drugs. </p>

<p>Page 11, Paragraph 5. The report notes that. NEPs vary greatly
with respect to the emphasis they place upon making referrals to
drug treatment and other public health services. This stems in
part from the desire to make the NEP &quot;user friendly&quot;,
the recognition that many active IDUs express no interest in
entering drug treatment, and the related belief that an over
emphasis on drug treatment could alienated potential NEP
clients.&quot; This assertion for which two literature references
are cited is a dangerously misleading generalization. First it is
unclear what the authors mean by &quot;user-friendly&quot;. This
implies that drug treatment is somehow not user friendly which is
clearly not the case. Secondly, the references to drug treatment
are based published papers which were published before OTI/CSAT
came into existence, a development which has had an enormous
effect on the nature and quality of national drug treatment
services. We must remember that many of staff of these NEPs are
only casually familiar with the various treatment modalities, the
behavioral characteristics of drug using populations and are
generally not qualified to make determinations about who is
interested in treatment or not. In point of fact many drug users
are not interested in treatment, enter treatment for many other
reasons, e.g. secure primary care or to take a respite from their
addiction lifestyle, other than to address their addictions. It
does not follow, even from the limited evidence provided in the
cited studies, that emphasizing or overemphasizing treatment
produces alienation. finally, the determination of who should be
referred or not should never be left to so-called perceptions of
staff regarding &quot;readiness for treatment&quot;. </p>

<p>Page 12, Conclusion. There are a number of reasons why
referrals to drug treatment are limited other than the paucity of
drug treatment slots. One important consideration which may be a
limiting factor to referrals may in fact have more to do with how
various NEPs have evolved in relation to drug treatment programs
in the same area. It is abundantly clear that these programs have
not been in philosophical agreement regarding how to address the
needs of the addict. </p>

<p>Page 13, Conclusion. I don't think there is any serious
disagreement that the cost of NEPs are substantially cheaper than
any form of treatment including methadone. It is also true that
NEP is cheaper than coronary angioplasty, renal dialysis and a
range of other health care expenditure. The reference made to
methadone seems to suggest that there is contrast, or perhaps
imply that there is tacit substitution effect. The reference made
to methadone should be deleted since its incorporation in the
context of the conclusion is largely irrelevant. </p>

<p>Page 14, Paragraph 5. Our understanding of injecting drug use
among women is not as well developed as for men. While there is
evidence which suggest that men initiate women, this is by no
means an absolute. the fact remains that there are IDU
populations of women which operate independently from those of
men. Our limited knowledge of injecting behaviors among women
clearly indicates that there may be other factors involved with
respect to injecting behavior which may make it problematic to
apply NEP directed at male IDUs to female IDUs. </p>

<p>Page 16, Conclusion. The conclusion tragically fails to
appreciate the full range of antipathy and fear which African
Americans communities have for the &quot;symbolic
sanctioning&quot; of drug abuse by endorsing NEP in their
communities. After years of &quot;Just Say No&quot;, the
perception of many leaders in these communities is that NEP
represents a step back and not forward. Irrespective of whether
this perception is valid or not, the presence of these compelling
beliefs cannot be dismissed lightly. It is insulting to these
communities, also contrary to all of our Public Health platitudes
around cultural sensitivity to dismiss these visceral community
concerns by stating that &quot;newer African American
organizations established specifically to address HIV prevention
generally support NEP as did several mayors...&quot; This
statement literally indicates that the view of traditional
leaders from the African American communities and from church
leaders can and should be ignored in favor of those who support
NEP. This statement by it's intent, fosters divisiveness and is
antithetical to efforts made by other segments of public health
including those concerned with preventing HIV disease to engage
and not alienate the African American community. </p>

<p>Page 18, Conclusion. The overall issue here is the question
which frames this section, &quot;Do NEPs result in changes in
community levels of drug use?&quot; Clearly this is very complex
question which could not be answered within the scope of the
study, but one which nonetheless warrants a poignant level of
inquiry. However, the conclusion seems to go beyond the paucity
of evidence to conclude that there is &quot;no evidence that NEPs
increase the amount of drug use by NEP clients or change overall
community levels of non-injection and injection drug use.&quot;
This convoluted logic would have us believe that if it cannot be
established that NEP has an effect on drug use, then the absence
of correlates, irrespective of methodological limitations, is
tantamount to saying it has no effect. This conclusion is further
supported by indicating that interview with NEP clients and by
IDUs not using NEP, confirmed that they did not believe that
increase needle availability would increase drug use. It is not
clear how these two groups would qualify to speculate on new
incidence, especially by younger members of the community. In
general, this ipso facto logic is not only distressing, but
raises very real questions overall scientific validity of this
report. </p>

<p>Page 21, Conclusion. Though the majority of studies cited
indicated a decreased rate of HIV drug risk behavior, the real
issue here which is not addressed are whether these behavioral
changes are sustainable overtime. While there are clearly
compelling finding of short term behavioral change, these
indications do not provide definitive conclusions regarding the
effectiveness of NEP overtime. The proper statement of this
conclusion should insert the caveat that the studies reviewed do
not conclusive evidence at this time that these behaviors are
sustained overtime. </p>

<p>We at HRSA have reviewed this very thorough report on needle

definitely have a place in what must necessarily be a

<p>Subject: Draft Response on Needle Exchange </p>

<p>To: James Curran, M.D., M.P.H. </p>

<p>Associate Director for HIV/AIDS, CDC </p>

<p>In general we think the CDC's draft response to Jo Ivey
Boufford, M.D. concerning the University of California report on
needle exchange programs did an excellent job of covering the
salient issues. We do have a number of specific comments, which
follow: </p>

<p>page 2, paragraph 2: </p>

<p>We suggest adding a sentence to the effect that :
&quot;Substance abuse treatment programs also require substantial
funding increases in order to accommodate the needs of
individuals who decide they want to enter treatment as a result
of their involvement in needle exchange and other outreach
efforts to IDUs. </p>

<p>page 7, first paragraph: </p>

<p>We think it is important to mention the fact that needle
exchange remains an issue of special concern issue among
African-American and other minority politicians and community
leaders. Whether or not we think this concern is justified, we
need to acknowledge that it exists. </p>

<p>page 8, last paragraph: </p>

<p>We think it should be acknowledged that the degree to which
new HIV infections are reduced is strongly affected by (1) the
&quot;penetration&quot; of needle exchange in a particular city
and (2) the complexity of the drug-using populations and network
in particular communities (i.e., the number of, and kinds of
connections between, drug injection networks). </p>

<p>page 9, &quot;Impact of Needle Exchange Programs on Drug
Use&quot;: </p>

<p>Again, we think it is crucial to acknowledge and discuss the
fact that many African-American and other minority politicians
and community leaders fear that needle exchange programs condone
drug use and should be opposed on those grounds. </p>

<p>The last paragraph in this section should provide more
specific data to address this concern. </p>

<p>page 10, last paragraph: </p>

<p>The fifth sentence should read, &quot;Third, NEP clients
report decreases in their HIV drug-risk behaviors.&quot; </p>

<p>We disagree that the relationship between NEPs and HIV
infection may be impossible to study conclusively, particularly
since &quot;conclusiveness&quot; depends on the criteria being
used. This issue could be studied with several replications
(different cities or neighborhoods) to obtain better data than
now exist on this point. </p>

<p>page 11, last paragraph: </p>

<p>We suggest adding a sentence to the effect that, &quot;The CDC
should develop and foster the use of standardized data elements,
methods of data collection, and protocols for
evaluation/analysis.&quot; </p>

<p>page 12 first paragraph: </p>

<p>In the last sentence, we suggest adding the phrase,
&quot;using standardized methodologies.&quot; </p>

<p>page 15, first paragraph: </p>

<p>Again, we suggest adding to the last sentence's phrase about
the use of standardized data collection and evaluation
methodologies. </p>

<p>We appreciate the opportunity to review this response. </p>

<p>To: Associate Director for HIV/AIDS </p>

<p>Re: Request for Update on Needle Exchange Studies and Laws
Related to Needle and Syringe Sale and/or Possession </p>

<p>1. Background </p>

<p>The following information is provided in response to the
request of Brian Biles, Office of the Assistant Secretary for
Health, for an update on (a) studies of needle exchange programs
(NEPs) since the 1993 release of the University of California
(UC) three-volume, 700 page report on NEPs[1] and (b) recent
developments related to laws related to NEPs and possessions
and/pr sale of syringes. </p>

<p>2. New York City NEP evaluation reported at 1994 APHA
Conference </p>

<p>* At the 1994 American Public Health Association (APHA)
Conference, Dr. Don Des Jarlais presented and estimate of an
approximate 50% reduction in rates of new HIV infections among
injecting drug users (IDUs) using NEPs in New York City (NYC). </p>

<p>* This estimate was based on several small follow-up studies
of HIV incidence among IDUs using NEPs compared to HIV incidence
among IDUs in a vaccine preparedness cohort and cohort studies in
methadone maintenance.[2] A manuscript based the APHA oral
presentation is being prepared. Until this study is more fully
described, it is difficult to assess the basis for this estimate
of NEP impacting NYC. However, although the numbers are small,
the estimate is plausible. </p>

<p>3. Legal aspects of needle exchange, possession, and sale of
syringes </p>

<p>* In 1993 and 1994, three states (Maryland, Massachusetts, and
Rhode Island) enacted laws authorizing pilot NEPs; two states
(Connecticut and Hawaii) enacted laws expanding existing NEP
legislation. </p>

<p>* In September 1994, the Mayor and City Council o Los Angeles
declared a &quot;local state of emergency.&quot; The declaration
was based on &quot;... finding that an emergency in connection
with the AIDS epidemic and the transmission of HIV through
contaminated needles does exist, and that this emergency
threatens to cause extraordinary loss of life.&quot;[3] This
state of emergency was used as a basis for authorizing support
for &quot;responsible&quot; NEPs. </p>

<p>* In 1993 and 1994, similar declarations of states of
emergency have been made in nine other California cities and
counties - Alameda, Berkeley, Marin, Oakland, Salinas, San
Francisco, Santa Clara, Sonoma, and West Hollywood. </p>

<p>* A major reason for NEPs is the existence of several laws
that restrict the purchase, distribution, and possession of
syringes. These laws include &quot;prescription laws,&quot; under
which a prescription is required to purchase syringes and
&quot;drug paraphernalia laws,&quot; which establish felony
and/or misdemeanor criminal penalties for the possession and/or
distribution of syringes for nonmedical purposes. About nine
states have prescription laws and more than 40 states have drug
paraphernalia laws. In 1993, Maine repealed its prescription law.
</p>

<p>* In 1992, Connecticut partially repealed it drug
paraphernalia and prescription laws. The new laws allow purchase
of as many as 10 syringes without a prescription and possession
of as many as 10 syringes without a medical condition. A CDC and
Connecticut Health Department evaluation of the impact of these
new laws found that IDUs reported substantially less multiperson
use (&quot;sharing&quot;) of injection equipment. Also, after the
change in the laws, more than 80% of Connecticut pharmacies sell
syringes without a prescription and, for drug injectors, there
was a dramatic shift from &quot;black market&quot; sources of
syringes to purchases in pharmacies[4]. </p>

<p>4. Limitations of bleach disinfection and recommendation to
use sterile syringes </p>

<p>Several studies published in a special section of the July
1994 &quot;Journal of AIDS&quot; indicate that while bleach
disinfection can reduce the HIV transmission risk of IDU reuse of
syringes, it is not as safe as using a new, sterile syringe. The
following quotation summarizes the argument: </p>

<p>We reiterate that IDUs who cannot stop injecting drugs should
use sterile needles and syringes; ideally only once and then
safely dispose of them. IDUs should be told never to re-use
injection equipment that had been previously used by someone
else.... If one re-uses injection equipment, consistent and
thorough cleaning of equipment with disinfectants, such as
full-strength household bleach for longer rather than shorter
periods of time, should decrease, but may not eliminate the HIV
transmission risk[5]. </p>

<p>The following sections present additional information on NEPs
that has become available since the release of the UC report. </p>

<p>5. Decreases in HIV risk behaviors among NEP clients </p>

<p>The following data from San Francisco and New York, cities
with high volume NEPs, indicate decreases in HIV risk behaviors
reported by NEP clients: </p>

<p>* Decrease in needle-sharing rates associated with increased
use of the NEP among street recruited San Francisco IDUs[6]. </p>

<p>* Reduction in needle-sharing rates among IDUs attending NEPs
in New York City[7]. </p>

<p>* Reductions in the proportions of IDUs attending drug
detoxification programs in New York City who injected with a use
syringe and who lent used syringes to others, associated with the
opening of NEPs in that city. </p>

<p>6. No evidence of an increase in drug use in San Francisco, a
city with a high-volume NEP </p>

<p>The San Francisco NEP opened in 1987. It is a now one of the
highest volume NEPs in the United States; 343,888 syringes were
exchanged during the Spring of 1992. The following data come from
repeated surveys (from 1988 to 1992) of IDUs in San Francisco: </p>

<p>* The median number of injections decreased from 1.9 per day
in the Fall of 1987 to 0.7 per day in the Spring of 1992.[6] </p>

<p>* The mean age of IDUs in the repeated surveys in San
Francisco increased from 36 years in the Spring of 1987 to 42
years in the Spring of 1992[6]. </p>

<p>* The proportion of San Francisco IDUs reporting that they
first injected drugs in the previous year decreased from 3.0% in
the Spring of 1989 to 1.1% in the Spring of 1992[6]. </p>

<p>Taken together, the last two finding suggest that significant
numbers of persons have not begun injecting drugs in a city with
a high-volume NEP. </p>

<p>7. Increase in estimated reduction of HIV incidence among IDUs
using the New Haven NEP </p>

<p>Earlier estimates derived from mathematical models indicated
that the rate of HIV infection among clients of the NEP in New
Haven, CT, was reduced by 33% by their use of the NEP. Updated
estimates from that model suggest that the reduction is more than
40%[9]. </p>

<p>8. Lower incidence of hepatitis B and C among IDUs using the
Tacoma NEP </p>

<p>A study of hepatitis B and C among IDUs in Tacoma, Washington,
using multivariate analysis to adjust for the demographic
characteristics of the IDUs found that, compared with nonusers of
the NEP, IDUs who had ever used the Tacoma NEP were seven times
less likely to become infected with hepatitis B and eight times
less likely to become infected with hepatitis C[10]. This study
demonstrates more clearly than any previous research that use of
NEPs is associated with decreases in blood -borne infections. </p>

<p>9. Substantial entry in to drug treatment of New Haven NEP
clients </p>

<p>Between September 1992 and July 1993, 112 of 596 NEP clients
(19%) in New Haven entered drug treatment. In addition, 205 IDUs
who did not exchange syringes were referred to drug treatment by
the NEP[11]. </p>

<p>10. Substantial IDU utilization of high-volume NEPs </p>

<p>One issue about NEPs is how much they will be used by IDUs.
Studies from tow cities with high-volume NEPs, New York City and
San Francisco, indicate that substantial proportions of IDUs
surveyed report use of the NEPs. </p>

<p>* Des Jarlais reported data indicating that in 1993 nearly
half (46%) of IDUs surveyed in New York City had used an NEP[2]. </p>

<p>* Surveys of IDUs in San Francisco in the Spring of 1992 found
that 45% &quot;usually&quot; obtained their syringes from the San
Francisco NEP[6]. </p>

<p>11. Increasing Number of NEPs in the United States </p>

<p>The UC report found at least 37 active NEPs in the United
States as of September 1993. As of October 1994, an estimated 70
NEPs were in operation in the United States[12]. </p>

<p>12. Support from the general public for NEPs for AIDS
prevention </p>

<p>In the first national opinion poll on NEPs, a 1994 national
telephone survey of 1,001 people, the majority (55%) of
respondents favored &quot;Implementing needle exchange programs
to reduce the spread of diseases such as AIDS.&quot;[13] </p>

<p>13. Support for federal funding of NEPs from the National
Academy of Sciences </p>

<p>A study on AIDS behavioral research published in 1994 by the
Institute of Medicine, described NEPs as &quot;highly
promising&quot; and called for the lifting of the ban on the use
of federal funds for NEP services. &quot;The weight of evidence
suggests that needle exchange does more good than harm,&quot;
concluded the authors[14]. </p>

<p>14. High HIV seroconversion among Montreal IDUs </p>

<p>The highest levels of HIV seroprevalence among IDUs in Canada
have been reported from Montreal. Bruneau reports from the St.
Luc IDU cohort that among 850 IDUs recruited 1989-1993, the half
(54%) reporting use of a Montreal NEP had higher HIV
seroprevalence (18.2% vs. 5.6%) compared with nonattenders. Among
the 507 IDUs with multiple visits to the study site, the
seroconversion rate was higher (11.6 vs 3.5 per 100 person-years
[p&lt;0.0001]) among IDUs using NEP[15]. </p>

<p>A study of incarcerated IDUs found that IDUs using a Montreal
NEP reported higher rates of HIV risk behaviors (vs. IDUs who did
not use a NEP). Montreal NEP attenders were more likely than
non-attenders, to have same sex partners, to work in the sex
industry, to report injecting with needles used by an
HIV-infected IDU, and re-use borrowed injection equipment without
cleaning[16]. </p>

<p>The higher HIV seroprevalence, HIV seroconversion, and HIV
risk factors among IDUs attending the Montreal NEP require
furthers study. </p>

<p>15. Comments and conclusions </p>

<p>Since the 1993 release of the UC report: </p>

<p>* The number of U.S. NEPs has increased, and more states and
localities have approved NEPs by legislation or declaration of
sates of emergency; </p>

<p>* In communities with high-volume NEPs, substantial
proportions of IDUs report using the NEP; </p>

<p>* Biological evidence suggests decreases of bloodborne virus
transmission among NEP clients, with the evidence stronger for
hepatitis than HIV; </p>

<p>* There is additional evidence that in most cities with NEPs,
NEP clients have lower rates of HIV risk behaviors; and </p>

<p>* Higher HIV seroconversion rates among IDUs using the
Montreal NEP were documented and must be further investigated. </p>

<p>Appendix IV </p>

<p>Legal Barriers to Federal Funding of Needle Exchange Programs </p>

<p>EXCERPTED FROM March 1993 report by General Accounting Office
(GAO), titled &quot;NEEDLE EXCHANGE PROGRAMS -- Research Suggests
Promise as an AIDS Prevention Strategy. </p>

<p>Since 1988, Congress has passed at least six laws (in addition
to the Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Administration
(ADAMHA) Reorganization Act of 1992) that contain provisions
prohibiting or restricting use of federal funding for needle
exchange programs and activities. These provisions are contained
in: </p>

<p>the Comprehensive Alcohol Abuse, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health
Amendments Act of 1988; the Health Omnibus Programs Extension of
1988; </p>

<p>the Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency Act of
1990; and the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services,
and Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Acts of 1990,
1991, and 1993 (the Appropriations Act of 1992 did not contain
such a provision). </p>

<p>The Comprehensive Alcohol Abuse, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health
Amendments Act of 1988 required states, as a condition for
receiving ADAMHA block grant funds under title XIX of the PHS
Act, to agree that funds would not be used to carry out any
programs of distributing sterile needles for the hypodermic
injection of any illegal drug or distributing bleach for the
purpose of cleansing needles for such hypodermic injection
....&quot; </p>

<p>This provision was repealed by the ADAMHA Reorganization Act
(1992). </p>

<p>The Health Omnibus Programs Extension of 1988 authorizes funds
and programs aimed at combating the AIDS epidemic and preventing
its transmission. Among other things, the act authorizes grants
and contracts through the Director of the National Institute of
Allergy and Infectious Diseases to assist public and nonprofit
private entities in conducting research and training in advanced
diagnostic, prevention, and treatment methods for AIDS. These
grants may be used to operate demonstration projects in long-term
monitoring and outpatient treatment of HIV-infected individuals.
The act also authorizes funds for AIDS education. Additionally,
the Director of the National Institutes of Health is to establish
projects to promote cooperation among public health agencies and
with private entities in research concerned with the diagnosis,
prevention, and treatment of A[DS. The act provides further: </p>

<p>None of the funds provided under this Act or an amendment made
by this Act shall be used to provide individuals with hypodermic
needles or syringes so that such individuals may use illegal
drugs, unless the Surgeon General of the Public Health Service
determines that a demonstration needle exchange program would be
effective in reducing drug abuse and the risk that the public
will become infected with the etiologic agent for acquired immune
deficiency syndrome.&quot; </p>

<p>The Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency Act of
l990 (42 U.S.C.  300ff et seq.) authorizes grants to localities
disproportionately affected by the HIV epidemic. The act
prohibits use of funds made available under this Act, or an
amendment made by this Act . . . to provide individuals with
hypodermic needles or syringes so that such individuals may use
illegal drugs.&quot; </p>

<p>The Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and
Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Acts of l990 and
1991 contained identical prohibitions regarding needle exchange
programs (section 520 of P.L. 101-166 and section 512 of P.L.
101-517). The provision stated: </p>

<p>None of the funds appropriated under this Act shall be used to
carry out any program of distributing sterile needles for the
hypodermic injection of any illegal drug unless the President of
the United States certifies that such programs are effective in
stopping the spread of HIV and do not encourage the use of
illegal drugs.&quot; </p>

<p>In contrast, the Departments of Labor, Health and Human
Services, and Education, and Related Agencies Appropriation Act
of 1993, states in section 514 of the General Provisions&quot;: </p>

<p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, no funds
appropriated under this Act shall be used to carry out any
program of distributing sterile needles for the hypodermic
injection of any illegal drug unless the Surgeon General of the
United States determines that such programs are effective in
preventing the spread of HIV and do not encourage the use of
illegal drugs, except that such funds may be used for such
purposes in furtherance of demonstrations or studies authorized
in the ADAMHA Reorganization Act (P L. 102-321).&quot; <br>

<p> Introduction </p>

<p> The Select Committee on Narcotics Abuse and Control held a </p>

<p> 2day hearing in the 2d session of the 100th Congress to </p>

<p> examine the legalization of all illicit narcotics. </p>

<p> These informational hearings, entitled &quot;Legalization of </p>

<p> Illicit Drugs: Impact and Feasibility,&quot; were held in </p>

<p> response to public debate that began in early 1988, after </p>

<p> the mayor of Baltimore told a Washington, DC meeting of </p>

<p> the U.S. Conference of Mayors that existing U.S. drug </p>

<p> policy had failed. The mayor suggested legalization and </p>

<p> decriminalization as possible approaches to solving the </p>

<p> problem. </p>

<p> The hearings were designed to consider the seriousness of </p>

<p> a variety of legalization proposals that had been offered </p>

<p> by drug policy observers who, after the Baltimore mayor's </p>

<p> call for a look at legalization, stepped up their own </p>

<p> criticisms of U.S. antidrug policy. In effect, they </p>

<p> pronounced the symbolic war on drugs lost. </p>

<p> Now that the hearings have been completed, and testimony </p>

<p> has been studied and restudied, the committee, led by </p>

<p> Chairman Charles B. Rangel and Ranking Member Benjamin </p>

<p> Gilman, has produced a list of findings resulting from the </p>

<p> many hours of testimony. </p>

<p> The findings are not for any specific legislative purpose. </p>

<p> Instead, they are intended solely as an advisory to any </p>

<p> Members of the U.S. Congress and the public as to what the </p>

<p> committee believes was established by the proceedings. </p>

<p> How the Hearings Evolved </p>

<p> In the spring of 1988, Baltimore Mayor Kurt L. Schmoke was </p>

<p> speaking to his colleagues at the U.S. Conference of </p>

<p> Mayors annual meeting on crime and drugs. During the </p>

<p> speech, Mayor Schmoke surprised the gathering when he </p>

<p> suggested that elected officials should consider the </p>

<p> legalization or the decriminalization of illicit drugs in </p>

<p> response to America's escalating drug crisis. </p>

<p> In his speech, Mayor Schmoke criticized America's current </p>

<p> antidrug approach as a wasteful proposition bent too far </p>

<p> toward law enforcement and not far enough toward treatment </p>

<p> and rehabilitation of drug addicts. Recalling his days as </p>

<p> a prosecuting attorney, Mayor Schmoke cited what he viewed </p>

<p> as the miniscule impact of arrests and convictions of drug </p>

<p> traffickers and drug users on the overall drug problem. </p>

<p> Schmoke's comments were the proverbial &quot;shots heard
around </p>

<p> the world,&quot; as few, if any, public officials had treaded
</p>

<p> into such politically explosive waters before on the </p>

<p> sensitive narcotics issue. </p>

<p> Select Committee Chairman Rangel (D-NY) responded almost </p>

<p> immediately to Mayor Schmoke's legalization calls. </p>

<p> Chairman Rangel decried the notion as stemming from </p>

<p> frustration and exhasperation with the Nation's </p>

<p> mushrooming drug crisis. Chairman Rangel contended in </p>

<p> interviews and opinion articles that legalization would be </p>

<p> a tactical error in the war on drugs that would quite </p>

<p> possibly lead to a nation full of drug addicts. </p>

<p> Throughout the ensuing months after the hearing was </p>

<p> announced, people on both sides of the issue began </p>

<p> tangling publicly over the question. An informal national </p>

<p> debate had begun, and many looked toward the hearings </p>

<p> scheduled by Chairman Rangel as a final commentary on the </p>

<p> subject at least for the time being. </p>

<p> in calling for the hearings, Chairman Rangel expressed a </p>

<p> desire to get to the heart of suggestions being proposed </p>

<p> by legalization proponents. Although pro-legalization </p>

<p> advocates claimed they were simply calling for a debate on </p>

<p> the issue, Chairman Rangel impressed upon them that they </p>

<p> should come forward with specific plans and proposals, </p>

<p> rather than just debate the subject. Chairman Rangel made </p>

<p> a special plea with public officials suggesting </p>

<p> legalization or decriminalization to come forward with </p>

<p> specifics to satisfy the burden of their responsibility to </p>

<p> the American public. </p>

<p> Throughout the debate, Chairman Rangel asked legalization </p>

<p> advocates a series of questions in order that they might </p>

<p> clarify their positions. Among them: </p>

<p> (1) has anybody ever considered which narcotic and </p>

<p> psychotropic drugs might be legalized? </p>

<p> (2) would we allow all drugs to become legally sold and </p>

<p> used, or would we select the most abused few, such as </p>

<p> cocaine, heroin, and marijuana? </p>

<p> (3) who would administer the dosages-the State or the </p>

<p> individual? </p>

<p> (4) what quantity of drugs would each individual be </p>

<p> allowed to get? </p>

<p> (5) what about addicts, would we not have to give them </p>

<p> more in order to satisfy their craving, or would we give </p>

<p> them enough just to whet their appetites? </p>

<p> (6) what do we do about those who are experimenting? Do </p>

<p> we sell them drugs, too, and encourage them to pick up the </p>

<p> habit? (7) furthermore, will the government establish tax- </p>

<p> supported facilities to sell these drugs? </p>

<p> (8) would we get the supply from the same foreign </p>

<p> countries that support our habit now, or would we create </p>

<p> our own internal sources? </p>

<p> (9) would there be an age limit on purchases, as is the </p>

<p> case with alcohol? </p>

<p> (10) how many people are projected to become addicts as a </p>

<p> result of legalization? </p>

<p> (11) what about pilots, railroad engineers, surgeons, </p>

<p> police, cross-country truckers and nuclear plant employees </p>

<p> who want to use marijuana and cocaine during off-duty </p>

<p> hours? </p>

<p> (12) what about crack cocaine as a legalized drug? Would </p>

<p> we want to legalize something as harmful and as </p>

<p> destructive to our youth as this? </p>

<p> Legalization: A Recurring Theme </p>

<p> The legalization debate seems to rise to the surface when </p>

<p> the drug crisis reaches alarming levels, as it has </p>

<p> recently. The drug issue eventually moved to the top of </p>

<p> the list of Americans' concerns during 1988, given the </p>

<p> spate of news stories on the growing influence of the </p>

<p> narcotics trade in everyday lives. </p>

<p> Throughout the year, there were revelations from the </p>

<p> Select Committee on Narcotics and other congressional </p>

<p> committees about the suspected involvement of some foreign </p>

<p> leaders in the drug trade. Americans were also bombarded </p>

<p> by reports of the increased prevalence of deadly, </p>

<p> addictive crack cocaine; growing gang involvement in the </p>

<p> narcotics trade; a tripling of cocaine imports to the </p>

<p> United States in the 1980's; a significant rise in drug- </p>

<p> related violence sparked by tension between warring </p>

<p> traffickers and by street dealers bent on attention- </p>

<p> getting retaliatory tactics. </p>

<p> At the time of the hearing, one major news poll revealed </p>

<p> that the American public was more concerned about the </p>

<p> crisis of illegal drugs than about any other issue- </p>

<p> including the budget deficit. </p>

<p> The ABC News polling data also indicated that Americans </p>

<p> were wary of legalization, Nine out of ten opposed </p>

<p> legalizing all drugs and about 50 percent of the </p>

<p> respondents feared drug use would rise under legalization. </p>

<p> In a Gallup survey released 2 months prior to the hearing, </p>

<p> about 75 percent of those surveyed were opposed and nearly </p>

<p> 70 percent felt that legalization would aggravate the </p>

<p> Nation's drug problem. </p>

<p> Through the years, advocates of legalization have favored </p>

<p> an end to existing drug laws, often using the end of </p>

<p> Prohibition in the 1930's and the end of organized crime's </p>

<p> involvement in the illegal liquor trade as an example in </p>

<p> making their case. </p>

<p> Chairman Rangel, on the other hand, asked of legalization </p>

<p> advocates in 1988: What drugs would we legalize? Who </p>

<p> would manufacture and distribute them? In what </p>

<p> neighborhoods would they be sold and marketed? Would </p>

<p> crack cocaine be legalized in a legalization scheme? </p>

<p> Would there be age and quantity limits on purchases? How </p>

<p> much would we give addicts, enough to satisfy their </p>

<p> craving? </p>

<p> Other opponents of the legalization theory suggested that </p>

<p> in addition to a potential meteoric rise in addictions, </p>

<p> there is no guarantee that the black market for drugs </p>

<p> would close down, especially if restrictions are placed on </p>

<p> purchase quantity and on the quality of various narcotic </p>

<p> substances. </p>

<p> Overview of the Proceedings </p>

<p> Thursday and Friday, September 29 and 30, 1988, were 2 </p>

<p> significant days in the 100th Congress regarding the drug </p>

<p> issue. In those 2 days, a total of 34 witnesses </p>

<p> representing Congress, law enforcement, government, </p>

<p> academia, and various drug-related interest groups </p>

<p> testified before the Select Committee on Narcotics on </p>

<p> legalization. </p>

<p> By the time the hearing commenced, the legalization issue </p>

<p> had gained such national exposure that the proceedings </p>

<p> were carried live over public television and public radio, </p>

<p> and was covered by a large contingent of print media. At </p>

<p> this point and time in 1988, legalization was a very </p>

<p> important topic to many Americans concerned about the </p>

<p> worsening drug crisis. </p>

<p> In addition to the announced lineup of witnesses, several </p>

<p> Members of Congress who do not serve on the Select </p>

<p> Committee on Narcotics offered testimony on the subject. </p>

<p> Representative Carroll Hubbard (D-KY) and Representative </p>

<p> Roy Dyson (D-MD) both told the panel that the Nation's </p>

<p> drug crisis had become more than just a problem in urban </p>

<p> America. In rural areas served by both those Members, </p>

<p> there has been a noticeable increase in narcotics-related </p>

<p> problems. Representative Benjamin Cardin (D-MD) warned </p>

<p> about the confused messages that would be sent to the </p>

<p> youth if drugs were legalized. Representative Kwesi Mfume </p>

<p> (D-MD) also outlined his opposition, but said that more </p>

<p> attention should be given to demand reduction. </p>

<p> Following is a summary of the statement of each witness. </p>

<p> The summary is intended to capture the essence of what the </p>

<p> witness presented to the panel in his or her opening </p>

<p> statement, and is not a verbatim translation of the actual </p>

<p> testimony. </p>

<p> Findings </p>

<p> 1. The ideas and recommendations of pro-legalization </p>

<p> forces remain varied and wide ranging. There is no </p>

<p> commonly agreed upon approach that should be taken to </p>

<p> legalize illicit narcotics. </p>

<p> 2. The American public remains largely opposed to the </p>

<p> notion of legalizing illicit drugs. </p>

<p> 3. There is no data to support the theory that </p>

<p> legalizing illicit drugs would result in less crime, more </p>

<p> affordable narcotics or decreased drug experimentation, </p>

<p> abuse or addiction. </p>

<p> 4. There is no agreement on the types of currently </p>

<p> illicit drugs that should be considered for </p>

<p> legalization. </p>

<p> 5. No definitive information exists that would show how </p>

<p> America's youth would be affected by legalization, whether </p>

<p> positively or negatively. </p>

<p> 6. There should be a stepped up effort to look at the </p>

<p> expansion of treatment and rehabilitation resources around </p>

<p> the country. </p>

<p> 7. The Federal war on drugs must devote more resources </p>

<p> to curbing drug trafficking and abuse in major U.S. </p>

<p> cities. </p>

<p> 8. Narcotics law enforcement efforts need to be </p>

<p> improved, especially in major U.S. cities) </p>

<p> 9. Training for the staff of drug abuse treatment </p>

<p> centers needs to be expanded and improved. </p>

<p> 10. Federal drug abuse policies need more input from </p>

<p> residents of major American cities and not just from </p>

<p> governmental leaders,police chiefs, and substance abuse </p>

<p> professionals. </p>

<p> 11. The burden of proof regarding the benefits of drug </p>

<p> legalization must be placed on the advocates of such a </p>

<p> policy. Until the proponents of drug legalization can </p>

<p> demonstrate that the benefits of such a policy outweigh </p>

<p> the risks to health and drug-related violeiiee, drug </p>

<p> legalization should be rejected. </p>

<p> 12. American schools should continue to convey the </p>

<p> message that drug abuse is against the law, harmful to </p>

<p> health, and a detriment to optimal academic performance. </p>

<p> 13. Employee assistance programs [EAP's] in government </p>

<p> and industry must be strengthened to help employees and </p>

<p> their families deal effectively with drug abuse, </p>

<p> 14. We have not yet begun to fight the war. </p>

<p> Consequently, legalization should not be considered an </p>

<p> alternative. </p>

<p> Summary of Statements by Members of Congress </p>

<p> CHAIRMAN CHARLES B. RANGEL (D-NY), SELECT COMMITTEE ON </p>

<p> NARCOTICS ABUSE AND CONTROT. </p>

<p> Legalization has been widely discussed in academic </p>

<p> settings, and on radio and TV talk shows. But this is the </p>

<p> first time in a long time the issue has made its way to </p>

<p> the Congress. </p>

<p> Most of those who have been advocating legalization have </p>

<p> been calling for either a debate, a discussion or a </p>

<p> consideration. But after an advance reading of some of </p>

<p> the testimony, it does not appear that any of the </p>

<p> witnesses are truly'advocating legalization. </p>

<p> Some are saying legalization ought to be discussed because </p>

<p> the war on drugs is being lost with law enforcement. But </p>

<p> the Nation has yet to declare a real war on drugs. </p>

<p> For 8 years, the Congress has met resistance to antidrug </p>

<p> efforts. The Reagan administration has shied away from </p>

<p> providing funds to State and local governments so that </p>

<p> they can fight the war on drugs. </p>

<p> How can we say we have a war on drugs when a total of </p>

<p> 2,800 DEA men and women are dedicated to fighting the war </p>

<p> on drugs at the Federal level? </p>

<p> Some legalization proponents are calling for a greater </p>

<p> educational and rehabilitative commitment, but we do not </p>

<p> even have a single federally run rehabilitation program. </p>

<p> Some say we must do more with drug education, but so far </p>

<p> we have only had slogans like &quot;Just Say No&quot; and
&quot;Zero </p>

<p> Tolerance.&quot; </p>

<p> No opium or coca leaves are grown in this country, yet the </p>

<p> Secretary of State never utters his contempt for the </p>

<p> nations where these poisons are grown. </p>

<p> Legalization proponents must be prepared to discuss their </p>

<p> ideas and recommendations in detail. </p>

<p> HON. LAWRENCE COUGHLIN (R-PA), RANKING MINORITY MEMBER, </p>

<p> SELECT COMMITTEE: ON NARCOTICS ABUSE AND CONTROL </p>

<p> Having a hearing on legalization could send a wrong </p>

<p> message to America's young people that drugs are OK. </p>

<p> Having a discussion could be a copout in the war on drugs. </p>

<p> The hope is that the hearing will not be interpreted as an </p>

<p> indication that legalization is being suggested. </p>

<p> To quote the attorney general of Pennsylvania, Leroy </p>

<p> Zimmerman, &quot;In Philadelphia, over 50 percent of the
child </p>

<p> abuse fatalities involved parents who heavily used </p>

<p> cocaine. Cheaper, legal cocaine would result in more </p>

<p> children dying and more babies being born addicted.&quot; </p>

<p> HoN. BENJAMIN A. GILMAN (R-NY), SELECT COMMITTEE ON </p>

<p> NARCOTICS ABUSE AND CONTROL </p>

<p> Drug kingpins are Continuing to cash in on America's </p>

<p> insatiable appetite for illicit drugs. These </p>

<p> multinational criminal syndicates have built evil empires </p>

<p> from the drug trade. </p>

<p> The power of the drug trade threatens the authority of </p>

<p> governments worldwide. Colombia, for example, is </p>

<p> virtually under siege from the traffickers, </p>

<p> When the narcotics trade recently offered the Colombian </p>

<p> people the money to pay off the nation's foreign debt, the </p>

<p> people refused, resisting the financial temptation and </p>

<p> opting to take the moral high ground. </p>

<p> Those calling for legalization in America are seeking to </p>

<p> compromise the same values and morals that remain at stake </p>

<p> in Colombia. They are looking to cut a deal with the drug </p>

<p> trade. </p>

<p> Legalization would not put an end to the international </p>

<p> cartels, who would figure out ways to adapt and penetrate </p>

<p> the U.S. market. It would not end drug-related crime, as </p>

<p> many addicts on the street would continue to commit </p>

<p> criminal acts because of impaired judgment and instability </p>

<p> from illicit drug use. </p>

<p> It is hoped that fresh, new ideas will emerge from the </p>

<p> hearings that will make the Nation more effective in the </p>

<p> war on drugs. </p>

<p> HON. FORTNEY H. (PETE) STARK (D-CA), SELECT COMMITTEE ON </p>

<p> NARCOTICS ABUSE AND CONTROL </p>

<p> In New York and Oakland, only about 10 percent of the </p>

<p> cocaine and heroin addicts are able to be treated for </p>

<p> their addictions. In both cities, people seeking drug </p>

<p> treatment are required to wait at least 6 months for </p>

<p> treatment. Drug-related crime has skyrocketed as a result </p>

<p> of a lack of treatment slots. </p>

<p> Legalization is not the answer. We must find a way to </p>

<p> treat the drug abuser. </p>

<p> I am introducing a bill to provide treatment for addicts </p>

<p> seeking help. The bill would be financed through the </p>

<p> Social Security Programs' disability insurance provisions </p>

<p> and utilize a Medicare-like payment principal for </p>

<p> outpatient and inpatient services. </p>

<p> HoN. JAMES H. SCHEUER(D-NY), SELECT COMMITTEE ON </p>

<p> NARCOTICS ABUSE AND CONTROL </p>

<p> The ultimate copout in the war on drugs is to stand pat </p>

<p> with the current ineffective drug control policy. Pumping </p>

<p> more resources into a transparently failed system would be </p>

<p> an admission of defeat in the war on drugs. </p>

<p> Our system has totally failed. If seizures, arrests, and </p>

<p> convictions are going up, then so is violence and </p>

<p> addiction. We must end the preoccupation with the </p>

<p> criminal justice aspect of the problem and focus more on </p>

<p> education and treatment. </p>

<p> A new system and a new strategy would involve changing </p>

<p> people's behavior. We have successfully changed attitudes </p>

<p> and behavior on alcohol and tobacco consumption. </p>

<p> The question is, How do we reduce the demand for drugs? </p>

<p> We need to examine the costs and benefits of police </p>

<p> crackdowns. We have to address a broad spectrum of </p>

<p> options and put substantially more resources into those </p>

<p> programs that really work. </p>

<p> HON. CARDISS COLLINS (D-IL), SELECT COMMITTEE ON </p>

<p> NARCOTICS ABUSE AND CONTROL </p>

<p> Drugs have been a problem for many years. It is one of </p>

<p> the greatest public evils in the United States. </p>

<p> The present administration has demonstrated a profound </p>

<p> lack of understanding on the drug issue. The First Lady </p>

<p> has told us to &quot;Just Say No,&quot; while the President
has said </p>

<p> no to an effective policy to rapidly eradicate drug crops </p>

<p> from society. </p>

<p> It seems incontrovertible that the immediate effect of </p>

<p> legalization would be rampant drug use. This would occur </p>

<p> for at least a short period, as the lion that has been </p>

<p> held captive for many years would be let out of the den. </p>

<p> Even if legalization were to have the desired effect, it </p>

<p> would not work until the lion became accustomed to the new </p>

<p> liberties. That could be a very long time, and the Nation </p>

<p> could not afford to wait. </p>

<p> Legalization could lead to a legal and constitutional </p>

<p> quagmire, in which the newly legal rights of individuals </p>

<p> must be merged with the obligation to protect society. </p>

<p> HON. DANIEL K. AKAKA (D-HI), SELECT COMMITTEE ON </p>

<p> NARCOTICS ABUSE AND CONTROL </p>

<p> The issue is not whether we ought to sanction the use of </p>

<p> drugs, but whether legalization can break the stranglehold </p>

<p> that drugs have had on our communities. </p>

<p> We have contended that drugs affect all of us, not just </p>

<p> users and pushers. That has never been more apparent than </p>

<p> it is today. </p>

<p> HON. FRANK J. GUARINI (D-NJ), SELECT COMMITTEE ON </p>

<p> NARCOTICS ABUSE AND CONTROL </p>

<p> Legalization is not the cure for the Nation's drug </p>

<p> problems. It is the wrong policy, and it sends the wrong </p>

<p> signal. It sends the signal to the drug lords that the </p>

<p> Nation has lost, and they have won. It tells America's </p>

<p> youth that the U.S. Government says yes to drugs. </p>

<p> People should be motivated so that they don't need drugs. </p>

<p> They need to be given something to believe in. A sense of </p>

<p> purpose and a spirit of idealism need to be renewed in </p>

<p> America. Hope and dreams should replace despair and </p>

<p> hunger. </p>

<p> There should be a dialog on the issue, as it may in the </p>

<p> long run contribute to bringing an end to the drug crisis. </p>

<p> HoN. DANTE B. FASCELL (D-FL), SELECT COMMITTEE ON </p>

<p> NARCOTICS ABUSE AND CONTROL </p>

<p> The fight against drugs must focus on interdiction, </p>

<p> education, and rehabilitation. We just passed an oninibus </p>

<p> drug bill in the House, but no matter how vigorously we </p>

<p> attack the problem, we must key on reducing demand. </p>

<p> The issue should be discussed, and all views should get a </p>

<p> fair hearing. But legalization and decriminalization are </p>

<p> not the solutions to the drug problem. </p>

<p> A clear connection has been established between crime and </p>

<p> drugs. While many individuals commit crimes to get drugs, </p>

<p> others who commit crimes are found to have used illicit </p>

<p> drugs just prior to the commission of the crime. </p>

<p> Legalization will compound the situation because drugs </p>

<p> will be easier to obtain. It sends a misguided and </p>

<p> contradictory signal. </p>

<p> If drugs were legalized, how would we be able to tell our </p>

<p> kids to stay off drugs? How can we urge other countries </p>

<p> to work with us in interdiction and eradication efforts? </p>

<p> We must increase aid to State and local law agencies. </p>

<p> Efforts must be concentrated on interdiction, demand </p>

<p> reduction, and on rehabilitation and education. </p>

<p> HON. WILLIAM J. HUGHES (D-NJ), SELECT COMMITTEE ON </p>

<p> NARCOTICS </p>

<p> ABUSE AND CONTROL </p>

<p> I am very much opposed to legalization. This view comes </p>

<p> after reflecting on 24 years as either a prosecutor or a </p>

<p> Member of Congress. </p>

<p> Where in the entire world has legalization worked? </p>

<p> Witnesses would do well to indicate this to the committee </p>

<p> in testimony. Also, indicate to the committee how the </p>

<p> profits are going to be removed from the drug trade under </p>

<p> legalization. The black market will not be eliminated. </p>

<p> Policies of recent years are workable if they are followed </p>

<p> with the proper commitment. To date, the commitment has </p>

<p> not been made in terms of effort and resources. </p>

<p> The Nation's strategy is good. Many of the provisions in </p>

<p> the omnibus drug bill advance us in the right direction. </p>

<p> Once the Nation gets serious about the problem, we will </p>

<p> begin to turn the corner. </p>

<p> HoN. SOLOMON P. ORTIZ (D-TX), SELECT COMMITTEE ON </p>

<p> NARCOTICS ABUSE AND CONTROL </p>

<p> Drugs take away the God-given gift of human potential that </p>

<p> we all have. Illegal drugs are damaging our children, our </p>

<p> communities and our Nation as a whole. None of this would </p>

<p> change under legalization. </p>

<p> The question of legalization is not one of economics or </p>

<p> money or the black market. </p>

<p> The position of those who advocate legalization is </p>

<p> recognized. But when reasonable people discuss </p>

<p> unreasonable proposals, it is a sad commentary on the </p>

<p> impact that illegal drugs have had on society. </p>

<p> HoN. KWEISI MFUMF (D-MD), SELECT COMMITTEE ON NARCOTICS </p>

<p> ABUSE AND CONTROL </p>

<p> I am extremely opposed to the concept of legalization. </p>

<p> However, it is important that the debate take place. </p>

<p> Both sides in the debate agree on one thing: Illicit drugs </p>

<p> are tearing our Nation apart. It is estimated that some </p>

<p> 23 million Americans use illicit drugs once monthly. A </p>

<p> total of 6 million of these people use cocaine. Young </p>

<p> people in the United States use illicit drugs more than </p>

<p> their counterparts in any other nation of the world. </p>

<p> Proponents argue that legalization would remove the profit </p>

<p> motive. That may very well be, but drug use is driven by </p>

<p> demand and that's where more attention needs to be focused </p>

<p> nationally. </p>

<p> History shows that drugs made legal for adult consumption </p>

<p> cannot be kept out of the hands of children. Under </p>

<p> legalization, more children and young people would </p>

<p> experiment with drugs, as is the case with alcohol. It </p>

<p> has been estimated that about 75 percent of all drug users </p>

<p> become addicted. </p>

<p> Proponents often point to England and Holland as models </p>

<p> for a legalization proposal. But the concept has not </p>

<p> worked in either of those two countries. The policy of </p>

<p> legalized heroin had to be discontinued in England as the </p>

<p> number of heroin users increased and the black market </p>

<p> continued to thrive. In Amsterdam, Holland, where </p>

<p> marijuana is legal, crime and hard drug use remains a </p>

<p> problem. </p>

<p> An additional consideration is the threat of babies born </p>

<p> to drugaddicted mothers. That probably would be </p>

<p> exacerbated under legalization. So would other problems, </p>

<p> such as car and train accidents and corruption. </p>

<p> The U.S. focus on eliminating the drug problem should </p>

<p> expand beyond the one-dimensional effort to stop the </p>

<p> supply. More focus should be placed on demand reduction, </p>

<p> specifically treatment and rehabilitation. </p>

<p> If the United States is fighting a war on drugs, the </p>

<p> battlefields are not in Colombia and Bolivia, but rather </p>

<p> in our schools and our communities. </p>

<p> HON. MICHAEL OXLEY (R-OH), SELECT COMMITTEE ON NARCOTICS </p>

<p> ABUSE AND CONTROL </p>

<p> The idea of legalization should not even be dignified with </p>

<p> a 2-day hearing by the committee. </p>

<p> Consideration of the notion of legalization sends a bad </p>

<p> message to the rest of the Nation and to the rest of the </p>

<p> world. America's teenagers who may be considering </p>

<p> experimenting with drugs may see that legalization is </p>

<p> being considered and think that it is now OK to use drugs. </p>

<p> Legalization is unacceptable in a civilized society. </p>

<p> My hope for an outcome to the hearings is that the book on </p>

<p> legalization will be closed once and for all. </p>

<p> HON. Tom LEWIS (R-FL), SELECT COMMITTEE ON NARCOTICS </p>

<p> ABUSE </p>

<p> AND CONTROL </p>

<p> It is contradictory that those committed to fighting drugs </p>

<p> have agreed to give a hearing to the legalization issue. </p>

<p> Making drugs more affordable and more available could be </p>

<p> detrimental to society. Particularly objectionable is the </p>

<p> view of legalization advocates that the government itself </p>

<p> can make a profit from the drug trade. </p>

<p> Legalizing drug profits and making dealers out of the </p>

<p> government and private citizens is appalling. </p>

<p> HON. CARROLL HUBBARD, JR. (D-KY) </p>

<p> The urban drug problem is well known. But the war on </p>

<p> drugs needs to be fought in rural America, as well. The </p>

<p> drug problem is acute and serious in outlying areas. </p>

<p> In my own congressional district, in western Kentucky, the </p>

<p> U.S. Customs Service is aware of the severity of the drug </p>

<p> problem. They and the Drug Enforcement Administration </p>

<p> know of contraband-carrying flights from Colombia and </p>

<p> Mexico that arrive at our rural airports. These small </p>

<p> airports are safer for drug dealers than flying into </p>

<p> places like New Orleans and Miami. </p>

<p> I hope that the Congress will be able to lead the public </p>

<p> and our government away from legalization. I hope that </p>

<p> those who are proposing legalization would realize that </p>

<p> more people would experiment with drugs under Such a plan. </p>

<p> In my district, even the schools are not immune to the </p>

<p> drug trade. At a grand jury hearing last December in </p>

<p> Bowling Green, I testified that there were individuals </p>

<p> selling drugs to Western Kentucky University students. My </p>

<p> wife and I received death threats as a result of my </p>

<p> testimony, in which names were revealed. </p>

<p> Like others, I wonder what we can do to increase education </p>

<p> about drug abuse, and move as a nation toward a spiritual, </p>

<p> rather than chemical, dependence. </p>

<p> HON. ROBERT GARCIA (D-NY) </p>

<p> Legalization poses dangerous repercussions for the Nation. </p>

<p> It cannot be risked. It could not be sustained. </p>

<p> The legalization proposal comes at a time when public </p>

<p> opinion toward drug abuse is beginning to take a turn for </p>

<p> the positive, and after the House has just passed major </p>

<p> antidrug legislation to improve on the 1986 antidrug bill. </p>

<p> Given the problems we continue to experience with tobacco </p>

<p> and alcohol, the risks of legalization are just too great. </p>

<p> The biggest concern about legalization is the effect that </p>

<p> it would have on America's youth. Legalization would </p>

<p> result in the widespread use of drugs, especially among </p>

<p> youth. The greatest impact would be felt in minority </p>

<p> communities and in the inner city. </p>

<p> As long as there are drug users who cannot afford drugs </p>

<p> legally, there will be a black market. Unless we legalize </p>

<p> all drugs-including crack, PCP, LSD-and unless we make </p>

<p> them universally available, there will be crime. </p>

<p> Legalization fails to take into account whether special </p>

<p> restrictions would have to be placed on pilots, law </p>

<p> officers, truck drivers and others in hazardous </p>

<p> occupations. It also fails to consider the spread of AIDS </p>

<p> through intravenous drug use. </p>

<p> HON. Roy DYSON (D-MD) </p>

<p> Legalization is a foolhardy and reckless proposal that </p>

<p> would have a negative impact on the family. </p>

<p> The drug problem has filtered down to rural America. In </p>

<p> one of the counties located in my district, the number of </p>

<p> drug offenses rose 114 percent from 1986 to 1987. </p>

<p> Activists like Timothy Leary, Alan Ginsberg and Jerry </p>

<p> Rubin 20 years ago advocated that drug use was okay and </p>

<p> should be accepted as a form of escapism from the rough </p>

<p> times of the real world. But over the past 20 years, we </p>

<p> have seen the personal and financial ruin that drug use </p>

<p> brings about. </p>

<p> Under legalization, America would become enslaved to </p>

<p> drugs. Decriminalization is simply a backdoor way of </p>

<p> legalizing narcotics. </p>

<p> Legalization would send a bad message. It would increase </p>

<p> drug use and addiction. It would result in the </p>

<p> expenditure of billions of additional dollars in health </p>

<p> care costs and in lost productivity. </p>

<p> We must begin teaching our children at an early age about </p>

<p> the dangers of harmful drugs. Though education must play </p>

<p> a vital role in our antidrug efforts, we must still </p>

<p> initiate stiff sanctions against those who grow, use and </p>

<p> sell illicit narcotics. </p>

<p> HoN. BENJAMIN L. CARDIN (D-MD) </p>

<p> In a survey of my Third Congressional District (portions </p>

<p> of Baltimore City, Baltimore County and Howard County), 69 </p>

<p> percent of the respondents oppose legalization and </p>

<p> decriminalization. </p>

<p> A war on drugs cannot be won unless the profit is taken </p>

<p> out of the drug trade. But decriminalization is not the </p>

<p> way to accomplish that. </p>

<p> Constituents are saying that our discussions on the </p>

<p> national drug debate should also take into account the </p>

<p> damage from other harmful substances, such as alcohol and </p>

<p> cigarettes. </p>

<p> More money should be focused on establishing effective </p>

<p> treatment and education programs if a real war on drugs is </p>

<p> going to be waged. </p>

<p> What is needed is a comprehensive approach combining </p>

<p> foreign and domestic policy sensitive to the urgency of </p>

<p> interdiction efforts, stricter enforcement, more resources </p>

<p> to educate our youth to the dangers of drugs and treatment </p>

<p> programs without waiting lists. </p>

<p> Summary of Testimony From Thursday, September 29, 1988 </p>

<p> MAYOR KURT L, SCHMOKE, BALTIMORE </p>

<p> America needs to reexamine its current drug policy. The </p>

<p> Nation is spending about $10 billion annually to enforce </p>

<p> drug laws that are catching only a fraction of the </p>

<p> violators. </p>

<p> The drug problem in America is defined in two components: </p>

<p> addiction and crime. Law enforcement is unable to resolve </p>

<p> either of these two problems and actually has worsened the </p>

<p> crime problem. The black market is a result of the </p>

<p> manufacture and sale of cocaine being criminalized and </p>

<p> profits from drug sale-, are enormous because the </p>

<p> substances cannot be obtained legally. </p>

<p> Nationwide, there were 750,000 drug arrests in 1987 and </p>

<p> Baltimore had 12,000 drug arrests, yet both represent only </p>

<p> a fraction of the drug violators. Prisons and jails are </p>

<p> packed with drug offenders, One-third of all Federal </p>

<p> prisoners are incarcerated on drug offenses. </p>

<p> Cigarettes kill hundreds of thousands, but no move has </p>

<p> been made to make them illegal. Antismoking campaigns and </p>

<p> other </p>

<p> Neither PCP nor LSD should be legalized. But a </p>

<p> maintenance system involving designated hospitals should </p>

<p> be implemented for cocaine and heroin abusers, with the </p>

<p> opportunity for abusers to enroll in a treatment program </p>

<p> aimed at reducing the intake of either of these drugs down </p>

<p> to zero. </p>

<p> MAYOR EDWARD I. KOCH OF NEW YORK CITY </p>

<p> Mayor Schmoke's proposal to maintain heroin and cocaine </p>

<p> addicts is not new. The concept has been tried in Great </p>

<p> Britain, and it has failed. Addiction and crime both rose </p>

<p> as a result of doctorprescribed drug maintenance in that </p>

<p> country. </p>

<p> Legally received cocaine could be turned into the </p>

<p> derivative crack by mixing in baking soda or some other </p>

<p> base in the heating process. This would be a </p>

<p> surreptitious way for crack addicts to obtain their fix if </p>

<p> cocaine and heroin were legalized and prescribed. </p>

<p> Organized crime still, would play a role in drug </p>

<p> production and distribution for those who are either </p>

<p> underage or cannot get the amount and quality they desire. </p>

<p> In Great Britain, 84 percent of the government-registered </p>

<p> addicts during that country's heroin maintenance program </p>

<p> were discovered to be using other drugs illicitly. </p>

<p> With a population of 240 million people and about 6 </p>

<p> million regular drug users in that group, drugs still </p>

<p> remain unacceptable and drug users remain a sizable </p>

<p> minority in the Nation. If legalization were to go into </p>

<p> effect, there would be a gradual acceptability that would </p>

<p> lead to an increase in users. </p>

<p> There is little distinction between decriminalization and </p>

<p> legalization, and both are bad ideas that should be </p>

<p> opposed. </p>

<p> MAYOR DENNIS CALLAHAN OF ANNAPOLIS, MD </p>

<p> The most compelling argument for not supporting the notion </p>

<p> of legalization comes from the problems our society </p>

<p> currently experiences with alcohol. According to the </p>

<p> Research Triangle Institute in North Carolina, alcohol </p>

<p> abuse costs America about $117 billion annually in </p>

<p> medical, property, productivity and other losses. Of this </p>

<p> amount, only about $2,5 billion related to law enforcement </p>

<p> costs while the rest concerned accidents and other </p>

<p> problems associated with the abuse of alcohol. </p>

<p> Even marijuana should not be legalized. Advocates for </p>

<p> legalizing only this drug claim an overdose of it would </p>

<p> only put the user to sleep, but they could be asleep while </p>

<p> at the controls of a locomotive or another vehicle. </p>

<p> In Alaska, marijuana can be grown legally on private plots </p>

<p> and it can be consumed on the premises. A survey of </p>

<p> 250,000 high school students done by the Atlanta-based </p>

<p> organization, Parents' Resource Institute, indicates that </p>

<p> about one in five of those surveyed admitted to smoking </p>

<p> marijuana. About one in two of those surveyed in Alaska </p>

<p> admitted to smoking marijuana. It appears that the </p>

<p> sanctioning of marijuana use has contributed significantly </p>

<p> to the much higher usage figure in this State compared to </p>

<p> the rest of the Nation. </p>

<p> HoN. JACK LAWN, ADMINISTRATOR, U.S. DRUG ENFORCEMENT </p>

<p> ADMINISTRATION </p>

<p> Drugs are not bad because they are illegal. Instead, </p>

<p> drugs are illegal because they are bad, and legalization </p>

<p> advocates are missing the point in blaming drug laws for </p>

<p> the crime and violence that has resulted from the Nation's </p>

<p> drug crisis. </p>

<p> The problems that we continue to experience with legalized </p>

<p> alcohol use provide strong evidence that legalization </p>

<p> would be a bad idea. Greater availability results in </p>

<p> greater use and greater abuse. </p>

<p> The National Council on Alcoholism reports that one of </p>

<p> every three American adults contends that alcohol has </p>

<p> brought them family trouble. About 100,000 10- and 11- </p>

<p> year-olds reported getting drunk once weekly in 1985, and </p>

<p> about 100,000 deaths a year in the United States can be </p>

<p> attributed to alcoholism. Of that number, 23,000 are </p>

<p> killed on highways and cirrhosis of the liver is the </p>

<p> sixthleading cause of death in America. </p>

<p> The United States is signatory to the Single Convention on </p>

<p> Drugs of 1961, and to the Convention of Psychotropic Drugs </p>

<p> of 1971. Both these treaties require the country to </p>

<p> establish and maintain effective controls on illicit </p>

<p> substances. The sanctity of these treaties and U.S. </p>

<p> credibility in the international right against drug abuse </p>

<p> would be severely damaged if these substances were </p>

<p> legalized. </p>

<p> Legalization would adversely affect.young people and the </p>

<p> crime rate. The American public has said in recent </p>

<p> opinion polls that it opposes legalization. </p>

<p> Legalization is a simple answer to a complex problem. The </p>

<p> answer in fighting the drug crisis comes from focusing </p>

<p> more on demand reduction efforts. </p>

<p> ARTHUR C. &quot;CAPPY&quot; EADS, CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD,
NATIONAL </p>

<p> DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION, DISTRICT ATTORNEY, 27TH </p>

<p> JUDICIAL CIRCUIT, BELTON, TX </p>

<p> The whole notion of legalizing drugs ignores the reason </p>

<p> why drugs were made illegal in the first place. They are </p>

<p> bad for the user, the community and society as a whole. </p>

<p> Drug use often translates into child neglect and abuse, </p>

<p> runaways, molestation and other crimes and maladies that </p>

<p> result from individuals being under the influence of </p>

<p> drugs. </p>

<p> It is wrong to assume that funding for enforcement versus </p>

<p> funding for treatment and rehabilitation are distinctly </p>

<p> different, and that they are competing categories, as both </p>

<p> areas must be adequately funded for an effective antidrug </p>

<p> strategy. Effective treatment programs are essential in </p>

<p> sentencing drug offenders, while sanctions against drug </p>

<p> use are critical components of a treatment and prevention </p>

<p> strategy. </p>

<p> We have yet to implement in the United States, a full- </p>

<p> scale attack on the drug problem combining law </p>

<p> enforcement, treatment and prevention efforts into an </p>

<p> effective strategy. </p>

<p> HON. STERLING JOHNSON, JR., SPECIAL NARCOTICS PROSECUTOR, </p>

<p> NEW YORK CITY </p>

<p> Calls for legalization are borne from frustration with an </p>

<p> inadequate response from the executive branch of the </p>

<p> government. Unfortunately, not one single piece of </p>

<p> antidrug legislation has come from the executive branch of </p>

<p> the government. The only major antidrug legislation has </p>

<p> come from Congress. </p>

<p> It is improbable that heroin addicts could be </p>

<p> maintained, as Mayor Schmoke contends. If an addict's </p>

<p> habit is maintained at a certain level, over time the </p>

<p> level of that addict's habit will rise. The black market </p>

<p> would remain in existence under legalization. Further, </p>

<p> the matter of whether doctors, pilots and other people in </p>

<p> sensitive occupations would be allowed to use legal drugs </p>

<p> must be examined closely. </p>

<p> Legalized drugs will not stop crime, and the experience </p>

<p> with prescribed heroin in Great Britain provides evidence </p>

<p> that a downward trend in crime is not necessarily the case </p>

<p> of lessened restrictions on drug use. </p>

<p> Finally, the concept of free needles, which is supported </p>

<p> by Mayor Schmoke and also New York Citv Mayor Koch, is a </p>

<p> bad idea. It sends out erroneous signals that conflict </p>

<p> with any and all efforts to put an end to the use of </p>

<p> harmful illicit drugs. </p>

<p> JERALD VAUGHN, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, INTERNATIONAL </p>

<p> ASSOCIATION OF CHIEFS OF POLICE </p>

<p> The IACP represents more than 15,000 top-level law </p>

<p> enforcement executives in the United States. The group is </p>

<p> unequivocally opposed to drug legalization. </p>

<p> Overcrowded jails and prisons and loaded court dockets </p>

<p> indicate success, rather than failure, of law enforcement </p>

<p> in the battle against illicit drugs. Money is not being </p>

<p> wasted on law enforcement, as only 3 percent of all </p>

<p> expenditures at the Federal, State and local level involve </p>

<p> the civil and criminal justice system. A total of 1.4 </p>

<p> percent of Government spending goes toward the provision </p>

<p> of law enforcement services, and less than 1 percent of </p>

<p> the Federal budget is earmarked for law enforcement. </p>

<p> Less than 500,000 law enforcement officers are assigned to </p>

<p> protect more than 245 million American citizens, and the </p>

<p> lead antidrug agency has just 3,000 officers. </p>

<p> The IACP, in conjunction with the Justice Department, the </p>

<p> Bureau of Justice Assistance and DEA, called together law </p>

<p> enforcement authorities from all levels for five drug </p>

<p> strategy sessions in 1987. A major finding from those </p>

<p> sessions was that crime could be reduced through </p>

<p> cooperative community strategies. This information was </p>

<p> produced in manual form. </p>

<p> The United States has seen fit to protect Americans from </p>

<p> substances that may be harmful through the regulation of </p>

<p> the sale and distribution of these products. There has </p>

<p> lieen little complaint about the infringement on </p>

<p> individual rights in the process. It is understood that </p>

<p> these products-meats, milk, prescription drugs, serums and </p>

<p> vaccines-are regulated because the manufacturer alone </p>

<p> cannot be depended upon to put the interests of the </p>

<p> consumer ahead of the interests of profit. </p>

<p> Legalization is not a realistic option. At best, it is a </p>

<p> last resort when all else has truly failed. </p>

<p> WILLIAM CHAMBLISS, PH.D., PROFESSOR, GEORGE WASHINGTON </p>

<p> UNIVERSITY </p>

<p> The drug trade was estimated at about $1 billion a year 50 </p>

<p> years ago in 1938. Today, it is valued at somewhere </p>

<p> around $130 billion, which is larger than the gross </p>

<p> national product of most nations in the world and many </p>

<p> multinational corporations, </p>

<p> Drug profits remain essential to the survival of organized </p>

<p> crime. Churning out these profits and protecting them </p>

<p> involves engendering corruption of law enforcement </p>

<p> authorities, and this remains an ongoing goal of organized </p>

<p> crime, which remains a hazard of trying to stop the flow </p>

<p> and use of drugs by criminalizing it. </p>

<p> Because of the level of poverty and other factors, it is </p>

<p> impossible to expect a complete end to the drug trade even </p>

<p> if police were able to arrest each and every drug pusher </p>

<p> tomorrow. The costs of enforcing drug laws outweighs the </p>

<p> benefits, </p>

<p> A new drug policy should first take into account that </p>

<p> marijuana should be considered separately from such </p>

<p> substances as cocaine and heroin. States that have </p>

<p> decriminalized marijuana have had positive experiences as </p>

<p> a result. </p>

<p> Although the experiment with prescribed heroin in Great </p>

<p> Britain has not been totally successful, it is more </p>

<p> successful than what the United States has experienced </p>

<p> with criminalized heroin. Both heroin and cocaine should </p>

<p> be legalized and dispensed by medical professionals. </p>

<p> DR. CHARLES R. SCHUSTER, PH.D., DIRECTOR, NATIONAL </p>

<p> INSTITUTE </p>

<p> ON DRUG ABUSE </p>

<p> NIDA is strongly opposed to the legalization of illicit </p>

<p> narcotics. </p>

<p> First, there are a series of questions-including the many </p>

<p> posed by Chairman Rangel-that must be answered before we </p>

<p> can even begin to consider something as complicated as </p>

<p> legalization. For example, the pharmacological effects of </p>

<p> cocaine differ so that it is impossible to consider how </p>

<p> much would be considered enough, or a legal limit. </p>

<p> Second, there appears to be an attitude readjustment </p>

<p> occurring regarding drug abuse. According to the latest </p>

<p> national high school survey on drug abuse, drugs are being </p>

<p> seen by this group as more dangerous and there is a </p>

<p> reporting of more self-abstention from illicit drug use </p>

<p> than in other recent high school surveys. </p>

<p> In the 1980 survey, 11 percent of the respondents reported </p>

<p> daily marijuana use. The 1986-87 survey indicated that </p>

<p> figure had dropped to 3.3 percent. </p>

<p> As attitudes among adults and teenagers change, so will </p>

<p> behavior. What is also needed are more good treatment </p>

<p> programs, since we know that effective treatment works. </p>

<p> DR. ARNOLD TREBACH, PH.D., FOUNDER, DRUG POLICY INSTITUTE </p>

<p> America would be better off if all drug laws were removed </p>

<p> today. Americans are at their best when they negotiate </p>

<p> settlements, and at their worst when arguments are pushed </p>

<p> to the wall. </p>

<p> It is absolutely essential that we remove laws restricting </p>

<p> use of marijuana and heroin for medicinal purposes. It is </p>

<p> also important to begin viewing drug addicts from a </p>

<p> different perspective. We should be more concerned about </p>

<p> getting them treatment rather than branding them </p>

<p> criminals. This would include some form of maintenance, </p>

<p> which is admittedly controversial. </p>

<p> There should be limited experimentation with recreational </p>

<p> drugs. The 1973 Nixon Commission on Marijuana and Drug </p>

<p> Abuse as well as the 1982 report of the National Academy </p>

<p> of Sciences suggest an attempt at limited </p>

<p> decriminalization or legalization. </p>

<p> ADM. JAMES WATKINS, U.S. NAVV (RET.), CHAIRMAN, </p>

<p> PRESIDENT'S </p>

<p> AIDS COMMISSION </p>

<p> An emerging problem stemming from rampant drug abuse is </p>

<p> that of AIDS. One of the conduits of the deadly HIV virus </p>

<p> that leads to AIDS is contact with an individual who is an </p>

<p> abuser of drugs intravenously. </p>

<p> The IV drug abusers make up only 25 percent of all AIDS </p>

<p> victims, but about 70 percent of heterosexual native </p>

<p> citizens have contracted the disease from contact with an </p>

<p> intravenous drug abuser. About 70 percent of perinatal </p>

<p> AIDS cases involve a parent who is either an IV drug </p>

<p> abuser or who has a sexual partner who abuses drugs </p>

<p> intravenously. </p>

<p> More treatment is needed for IV drug abusers. There are </p>

<p> some 1.2 million IV drug abusers in the United States, but </p>

<p> only about 148,000 are in some form of treatment at any </p>

<p> given time. </p>

<p> What is needed is a full-scale effort that addresses both </p>

<p> supply and demand. </p>

<p> During its time as functioning body, the President's AIDS </p>

<p> Commission heard testimony regarding the use of needle </p>

<p> exchange programs. The overriding opinion of many black </p>

<p> leaders who testified at an inquiry held in New York City </p>

<p> is that IV drug abuse is killing the black community. </p>

<p> However, these same leaders were opposed to needle </p>

<p> exchange programs, and view them as a copout answer to a </p>

<p> very serious problem. They are considered the first step </p>

<p> to full-fledged legalization. </p>

<p> The most important thing that can be done to lick the drug </p>

<p> problem is to help young people avoid using drugs in the </p>

<p> first place. </p>

<p> DR. TOD MIKURIYA, M.D., PSYCHIATRIST, BERKELEY, CA </p>

<p> It is good to see an increase in public awareness about </p>

<p> the dangers of alcohol and tobacco and about the </p>

<p> increasing tendency to classify them as drugs of abuse. </p>

<p> While we focus heavily on the problems of drugs like </p>

<p> cocaine and crack, very little attention has been paid to </p>

<p> the problems caused by poisoning from alcohol and tobacco. </p>

<p> We need to move closer to acceptance of these substances </p>

<p> as dangerous drugs. </p>

<p> A comprehensive proposal regarding drug use in America </p>

<p> would encompass the following six points: </p>

<p> (1) The removal of product liability exemptions for </p>

<p> alcohol. </p>

<p> (2) The removal of price supports for tobacco. </p>

<p> (3) The establishment of a drug users' cooperative. </p>

<p> (4) The legalization of home cultivation of cannabis. </p>

<p> (5) The disallowance of searches of citizens' homes </p>

<p> without a warrant. </p>

<p> (6) A testing of those who test others for drug use. </p>

<p> JOHN GUSTAFSON, DEPUTY DIRECTOR, NEW YORK DIVISION OF </p>

<p> SUBSTANCE ABUSE SERVICES </p>

<p> Our agency oversees about 400 local treatment and </p>

<p> prevention programs, with a capacity to treat 46,000 </p>

<p> people and to provide counseling services to another </p>

<p> 17,000. </p>

<p> About 22 percent of New York's population has abused some </p>

<p> type of substance within the last 6 months. Half of this </p>

<p> number abuses drugs on a regular basis. More than 600,000 </p>

<p> people art- considered non-narcotic substance abusers and </p>

<p> about 260,000 are narcotics addicts. </p>

<p> The social and health consequences of legalization would </p>

<p> be too great. Legalization advocates are ignoring the </p>

<p> seductive properties of drugs like cocaine, which </p>

<p> laboratory tests show leave the user craving for more. </p>

<p> While alcohol Prohibition may have been a law enforcement </p>

<p> failure, it was a success healthwise. During the 1920's, </p>

<p> alcohol-related mental illness declined significantly, but </p>

<p> shot back up after the repeal of Prohibition in 1933. </p>

<p> From 1917 until 1921, New York State made narcotics </p>

<p> available through clinics. But that practice was </p>

<p> discontinued after it was discovered that many people were </p>

<p> supplementing their legal supply with drugs purchased from </p>

<p> the black market. This is a lesson for those considering </p>

<p> legalization today. </p>

<p> We cannot overlook the impact that legalization would have </p>

<p> on health and health care systems. Many illicit drugs </p>

<p> lead to chronic health problems for users, and this </p>

<p> problem would be pronounced under legalization. </p>

<p> STEVEN WISOTSKY, PROFESSOR OF LAW, NOVA UNIVERSITY </p>

<p> An independent national commission should be set up to </p>

<p> take a fresh look at U.S. drug policy. Such a commission </p>

<p> should have two fundamental goals: To reduce drug abuse, </p>

<p> and to reduce the social problems stemming from the </p>

<p> existence of the black market illicit drug trade. </p>

<p> A clear definition should be reached and agreed upon in </p>

<p> terms of what &quot;the drug problem&quot; in America is. Is
it </p>

<p> drug use in general? Is it drug use by children and </p>

<p> teenagers? Is it drug use that proves to be injurious to </p>

<p> others or to the drug users themselves? Is it the black </p>

<p> market and the events associated with that market in terms </p>

<p> of crime and violence? </p>

<p> Detailed studies and polls should be conducted to </p>

<p> determine how drugs should be legalized. This should be </p>

<p> along the lines of marketing surveys done to prepare for </p>

<p> the sale and distribution of other products. </p>

<p> For example, focus groups can be set up, and groups of </p>

<p> individuals-such as prison volunteers serving life </p>

<p> sentences-can be used for tracking the effects of certain </p>

<p> drugs and also for gauging the addictive qualities of </p>

<p> narcotics. </p>

<p> Among the priorities of drug control should be the </p>

<p> protection of children, the protection of the safety and </p>

<p> health of the public and the preservation of individual </p>

<p> liberties in the process. </p>

<p> The real moral high ground in finding a Solution to the </p>

<p> drug crisis is one that will allow responsible, competent </p>

<p> adults to have the freedom of choice so long as they do </p>

<p> not intrude on the rights and privileges of others. No </p>

<p> drug control policy should affront the Constitution. </p>

<p> DR. MITCHELL ROSENTHAL, M.D., PRESIDENT, PHOENIX HOUSE, </p>

<p> NEW YORK, NY </p>

<p> Drug legalization would increase drug use and would </p>

<p> further aggravate all the destabilizing influences that </p>

<p> plague societv today. </p>

<p> Addiction to illicit drugs has an enormous impact on the </p>

<p> character, behavior and values of the abuser. While just </p>

<p> as many cigarette smokers have become dependent on that </p>

<p> product, the number of cocaine users, the power of cocaine </p>

<p> addiction and the amounts that addicts would use if it </p>

<p> were readily available and less expensive is ignored by </p>

<p> those pushing legalization. </p>

<p> Illicit drug use rapidly diminishes one's ability to lead </p>

<p> a normal, productive life. Drug abuse causes self- </p>

<p> destructive behavior, lowering the self-esteem and </p>

<p> creating the potential for violent, antisocial behavior. </p>

<p> Projections that drug use would double or even triple </p>

<p> under legalization should be taken seriously. The </p>

<p> greatest increase would come from those between the ages </p>

<p> of 12 and 21 years old. Projections of drug-related </p>

<p> deaths post-legalization range from 100,000 to 500,000. </p>

<p> The social order will suffer. Drug users are generally </p>

<p> irresponsible people whose deviant behavior ranges from </p>

<p> destroying relationships to inability to lead productive </p>

<p> work lives to crime. All of these possibilities will be </p>

<p> raised with legalized drugs. </p>

<p> We can realistically expect to overcome the drug crisis </p>

<p> with a shifting public attitude and a stronger effort to </p>

<p> enforce drug laws on the street. </p>

<p> ETHAN NADELMANN, PH.D., ASSISTANT PROFESSOR, PRINCETON </p>

<p> UNIVERSITY </p>

<p> Neither legalization nor decriminalization should be </p>

<p> considered a surrender. They are the policies that drug </p>

<p> dealers fear most. </p>

<p> What is legalization? It is a model of analysis. It is a </p>

<p> cost benefit analysis of current policies. We have to </p>

<p> look at our policy and costs and compare to other systems </p>

<p> and figure out which has the most benefits for the money- </p>

<p> What is the drug problem? This must be defined before </p>

<p> going further. In the 1920's, people did not talk of
&quot;the </p>

<p> alcohol problem.&quot; Instead, they separated the problem
into </p>

<p> one of crime--the Al Capone types and their influence on </p>

<p> the consumption of alcoholand into another category of </p>

<p> alcohol abuse. It was decided that Prohibition was not </p>

<p> worth the costs, even if it reduced abuse to a degree. </p>

<p> Nevertheless, today the drug problem is not separated as </p>

<p> such and &quot;the drug problem&quot; is defined as both
crime and </p>

<p> abuse. </p>

<p> We will not be able to move forward until we make the </p>

<p> distinction as was made with alcohol in the 1920's. </p>

<p> Nearly 20 percent of all State and local resources go to </p>

<p> fighting drugs, In Washington, DC, more than half the </p>

<p> people in jail are there on drug-related charges, and the </p>

<p> figure in New York City is about 40 percent. </p>

<p> SUE RUSCHE, NATIONAL DRUG INFORMATION CENTER, FAMILIES IN </p>

<p> ACTION </p>

<p> It is important that the perspective of families be </p>

<p> included in the national debate on legalization. </p>

<p> In looking at both the alcohol and cigarette industries </p>

<p> they spent more on advertising in the previous year than </p>

<p> Congress appropriated to fight the drug crisis. We do not </p>

<p> need any more legal industries of this sort amassing large </p>

<p> profits in selling their products to our children and to </p>

<p> ourselves. </p>

<p> Some legalization proponents make the argument that </p>

<p> alcohol is legal and is not sold to young people. But </p>

<p> alcohol sales to minors are routine as sales clerks fail </p>

<p> to ask for identification or look the other way when </p>

<p> obviously underage young people make an alcohol purchase. </p>

<p> If we cannot expect the alcohol and tobacco industry to </p>

<p> prevent sales to minors, then how can we expect a cocaine </p>

<p> or opiate industry from doing the same? </p>

<p> At the very least, illicit drugs are as harmful as alcohol </p>

<p> and tobacco. Fewer people die from them than from alcohol </p>

<p> and tobacco because fewer people use them, and fewer </p>

<p> people use them because they are illegal. There are 18 </p>

<p> million marijuana users compared to 116 million alcohol </p>

<p> users; and there are 6 million cocaine users compared to </p>

<p> 60 million tobacco users. </p>

<p> Alcohol and tobacco are leading killers in the United </p>

<p> States. We do not live with alcohol and tobacco, we die </p>

<p> with them. It would take two walls like the Vietnam </p>

<p> Memorial shrine in Washington, DC to memorialize all those </p>

<p> killed by alcohol in a year. It would take 7 to 10 walls </p>

<p> to cover all those who die from tobacco. </p>

<p> Some say taxes from drugs sales could go toward treatment </p>

<p> and education, but no money from the sale of alcohol and </p>

<p> tobacco ever goes toward education and treatment for those </p>

<p> problems. </p>

<p> Legalization would not eliminate profits- They would </p>

<p> simply be shifted from the drug traffickers on the street </p>

<p> to the people who run legitimate businesses. </p>

<p> It is unreasonable to think that drug use would not </p>

<p> increase under legalization. A total of 11 States have </p>

<p> decriminalized marijuana. From 1972 to 1978, in those </p>

<p> States, marijuana use, as a result of the </p>

<p> decriminalization, rose 125 percent among young adults, </p>

<p> 130 percent among high school seniors, 200 percent among </p>

<p> older adults and 240 percent among teenagers. </p>

<p> We are beginning to see drug use drop off in this country. </p>

<p> We would like to see the Congress create a National Drug </p>

<p> Corps similar to the Peace Corps, where parents and </p>

<p> children could be trained to give I or 2 years of service </p>

<p> fighting drug abuse in their communities. </p>

<p> Summary of Testimony From Friday, September 30,1988 </p>

<p> DR. DAVID F. MUSTO, M.D., DRUG HISTORIAN, YALE UNIVERSiry </p>

<p> Around the turn of the century, drugs such as cocaine, </p>

<p> heroin and morphine were legally sold and consumed in the </p>

<p> United States, Consumption of these drugs reached a peak </p>

<p> around 1890 to 1900. </p>

<p> Because of the high rate of consumption and the effects </p>

<p> these then-legal narcotics were having on individuals and </p>

<p> families, America moved toward enacting laws and controls </p>

<p> that have led to today's drug laws. </p>

<p> We are currently experiencing our second epidemic with </p>

<p> cocaine. The first occurred around the mid 1880's, when </p>

<p> this drug was made available in 14 different forms. One </p>

<p> could smoke it, rub it on in a salve, inject it, or even </p>

<p> sniff it. </p>

<p> Cocaine's image as the &quot;All-American tonic&quot; ended
around </p>

<p> 1900, when it came to be known as the most dangerous drug </p>

<p> in the country. The first congressionally passed </p>

<p> legislation regulating cocaine was in 1914, and was called </p>

<p> the Harrison Narcotics Act. </p>

<p> A key to reducing the demand for drugs will be a changing </p>

<p> of the public's attitudes. </p>

<p> Those supporting a look-see at legalization must be </p>

<p> reminded that there are many things in our society that we </p>

<p> do not attempt a look-see because we know in advance it is </p>

<p> bad and would lead to worse problems. One of them, for </p>

<p> example, is racial discrimination. We ask for laws </p>

<p> restricting it because we know it is bad. </p>

<p> Ending the drug crisis will be a very gradual thing. It </p>

<p> cannot be done in just 2 or 3 years. Drug use in America </p>

<p> peaked around 1979, and at that time there was a call for </p>

<p> legalization. </p>

<p> The argument for legalizing cocaine in the 1970's was that </p>

<p> cocaine was a harmless drug unless misused. Today, the </p>

<p> argument is that legalizing it will remove the criminal </p>

<p> influence. We now see cocaine as bad in itself, and this </p>

<p> is a tremendous attitude turnaround that can be used as a </p>

<p> foundation for a further decline in cocaine usage. </p>

<p> DR. DALE MASI, PROFESSOR, SCHOOL OF SOCIAL WORK AND </p>

<p> COMMUNITY PLANNING, UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND </p>

<p> The workplace cannot afford the legalization of illicit </p>

<p> drugs. </p>

<p> In previous testimony before the Select Committee on </p>

<p> Narcotics Abuse and Control, my position was that there </p>

<p> was a dramatic need for an increase in industry drug </p>

<p> programs in this country. That need is greater today: </p>

<p> (1) A majority of illicit drug users are in the </p>

<p> workplace. </p>

<p> (2) Alcohol is the primary drug of abuse in the </p>

<p> workplace. </p>

<p> (3) Prescription drugs are the second largest drug of </p>

<p> abuse in the workplace. </p>

<p> (4) The most recent surveys indicate that 19- to 25-year- </p>

<p> olds are the biggest abusers of cocaine, with 25- to 30- </p>

<p> year-olds being the second largest group. If cocaine is </p>

<p> legalized, it would outdistance both alcohol and </p>

<p> prescription drugs as the most abused drug in the </p>

<p> workplace. </p>

<p> Drug abuse in the workplace translates into escalating </p>

<p> health insurance bills. In addition, it contributes to </p>

<p> the problems of absenteeism, sick leave, accidents, other </p>

<p> rising health costs and more worker compensation claims. </p>

<p> More emphasis will have to be placed on companies </p>

<p> educating workers about the dangers of drug abuse, as has </p>

<p> been the case with tobacco. Few companies, a study by </p>

<p> Cook and Harrell shows, have drug education promotion </p>

<p> programs. The IBM Corp. stands out as a model for the </p>

<p> rest of the industry in the country. </p>

<p> Schools of medicine, social work and psychology today </p>

<p> rarely require that students take a course in alcohol or </p>

<p> drug addiction. Fewer schools of psychology require a </p>

<p> course in drug addiction than was the case in 1950. The </p>

<p> council on social work education, the accrediting arm for </p>

<p> such schools, does not even require that such courses be </p>

<p> taught for master's and social work candidates. </p>

<p> We need employee assistance programs that concentrate on </p>

<p> reaching employees early. New funds are needed for </p>

<p> meaningful programs, especially outpatient services. </p>

<p> DR. LAWRENCE BROWN, M.D., CLINICAL INSTRUCTOR, DEPARTMENT </p>

<p> OF MEDICINE, HARLEM HOSPITAL CENTER AND THE COLLEGE OF </p>

<p> PHYSICIANS AND SURGEONS </p>

<p> Legalization advocates seem to be motivated by two </p>

<p> arguments, One is that current response to the drug crisis </p>

<p> has been shamefully inadequate. Number two, legalization </p>

<p> appears to represent a reasonable alternative to the </p>

<p> current response. </p>

<p> Our current policy on drug abuse can be addressed from two </p>

<p> angles. We can look at it either from the perspective of </p>

<p> those who use drugs, or from the perspective of the </p>

<p> consequences of drug use. </p>

<p> A most common problem of those admitted to Harlem Hospital </p>

<p> for treatment of kidney failure and in need of dialysis is </p>

<p> prior drug abuse. </p>

<p> Our approach to drug abuse as a nation is that we continue </p>

<p> to view it as a stigma, rather than the public health </p>

<p> problem that it truly is. </p>

<p> It is ridiculous that so little of the educational </p>

<p> training involves the study of drug abuse, Professional </p>

<p> and health professional schools should be encouraged to </p>

<p> try to include drug abuse studies in their curriculums. </p>

<p> Existing drug treatment facilities must be improved as </p>

<p> well. The least attractive facilities are often allocated </p>

<p> for outpatient drug treatment services. An expansion of </p>

<p> treatment capability must focus on both quality and </p>

<p> quantity. </p>

<p> The legalization debate provides the country with an </p>

<p> excellent opportunity to reassess Federal drug policy. </p>

<p> These discussions will far exceed their potential if they </p>

<p> are used to chart a bold new course in responding to </p>

<p> America's drug crisis. </p>

<p> DAVID BOAZ, VICE PRESIDENT FOR PUBLIC POLICY AFFAIRS, CATO </p>

<p> INSTITUTE, WASHINGTON, DC </p>

<p> Alcohol did not cause high crime rates in the 1920's. </p>

<p> Prohibition of alcohol was the problem. With today's drug </p>

<p> crisis, it is not the drugs, but rather the prohibition of </p>

<p> these drugs that are causing problems with crime and </p>

<p> violence. </p>

<p> There are six ways in which drug laws impact negatively on </p>

<p> society: </p>

<p> (1) Drug laws drive up the price. Users are forced to </p>

<p> commit crimes to support their habits. Prohibition pushes </p>

<p> some prices as much as 100 times higher than normal. Some </p>

<p> experts say half the crime in major cities results from </p>

<p> drug prohibition and many policemen will say the same </p>

<p> thing if they were free to express themselves honestly. </p>

<p> (2) Drug laws cause corruption. The extraordinary </p>

<p> profits become an irresistible temptation to policemen. </p>

<p> (3) Buyers are forced to come in contact with criminals, </p>

<p> unlike those who purchase alcohol without the help of </p>

<p> criminal,q because it is no longer illegal. </p>

<p> (4) Intense law enforcement forces the creation of </p>

<p> stronger, more potent drugs. Crack, for example, is a </p>

<p> result of drug prohibition. </p>

<p> (5) Civil liberties are abused under drug prohibition. </p>

<p> (6) A final negative result of drug prohibition is that </p>

<p> it leads to futility. In the case of today's drug crisis, </p>

<p> the drug war simply is not working. </p>

<p> GLORIA WHITFIELD (RECOVERED DRUG ADDICT), VOCATIONAL </p>

<p> REHARILITATION SPECIALIST, REHABILITATION SERVICES </p>

<p> ADMINISTRATION) DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA GOVERNMENT, </p>

<p> WASHINGTON, DC </p>

<p> As a rehabilitation specialist in drug and alcohol abuse, </p>

<p> it is frightening to consider what the caseload would be </p>

<p> if drugs were legalized. </p>

<p> How can anyone with any insight or perception believe that </p>

<p> legalizing drugs would be the answer to the drug crisis? </p>

<p> If the main reason to legalize drugs is to remove the </p>

<p> profit from the criminals and drug traffickers, then it is </p>

<p> also saying that the U.S. Government &quot;wants a piece of
the </p>

<p> action.&quot; Uncle Sam would become the biggest dope pusher
of </p>

<p> all time. </p>

<p> Generations of young Americans are dying from drug abuse. </p>

<p> Minds and motivation are being destroyed. Families are </p>

<p> being destroyed. America is being weakened. </p>

<p> Legalization could not be accomplished without having to </p>

<p> rely on imports. Small, drug-producing countries would </p>

<p> soon become superpowers and nations with gross national </p>

<p> products inflated by cocaine and heroin production would </p>

<p> have access to nuclear warheads. </p>

<p> Fraudulent prescriptions are already a big business in the </p>

<p> United States. </p>

<p> The future for America would be very dim under </p>

<p> legalization. Medical schools, laws schools and other </p>

<p> institutions of higher learning would not touch students </p>

<p> who use drugs, even if they were legal, because it is </p>

<p> known that drug users are a detriment to themselves. </p>

<p> Under legalization, there would not be enough hospitals to </p>

<p> take care of everybody. Doctors and nurses would be in </p>

<p> demand like never before. Long lines of dope fiends </p>

<p> waiting for a fix or a hit would replace the winos in the </p>

<p> streets. </p>

<p> Those favoring legalization are being insensitive. </p>

<p> Legalization is a further step toward the perpetuation of </p>

<p> evil influence over society, rather than a positive step </p>

<p> toward resolving some of the criminal problems in society </p>

<p> like poverty, insufficient health care, and insufficient </p>

<p> education. </p>

<p> America should wage a real war against drugs, using any </p>

<p> means necessary to prevent it from entering our ports and </p>

<p> coming across our borders. </p>

<p> RICHARD KAREL, JOURNALIST </p>

<p> Across the board legalization is not the answer to the </p>

<p> drug crisis that plagues the country today. More </p>

<p> dangerous drugs should continue to be prohibited, while </p>

<p> less dangerous narcotics be made legally available. </p>

<p> During the time that America was under alcohol </p>

<p> Prohibition, Great Britain was attacking the alcohol </p>

<p> problem through a combination of higher taxes, rationing </p>

<p> and limited hours of distribution. When the Volstead Act </p>

<p> was repealed, alcohol abuse rose in the United States </p>

<p> while Great Britain had already began experiencing a </p>

<p> leveling off of alcohol use. Alcohol abuse has remained </p>

<p> relatively low since. </p>

<p> Recent Studies indicate a decrease in cirrhosis of the </p>

<p> liver in the United States despite alcohol being a legal </p>

<p> substance. With tobacco, limited restrictions and </p>

<p> education have cut sales of this product to minors. </p>

<p> Prohibition is neither necessary nor advisable for either </p>

<p> of these products. </p>

<p> The focus should be on keeping dangerous drugs like crack </p>

<p> and PCP away from children, and on preventing clinically </p>

<p> controlled drugs from being diverted. This would provide </p>

<p> a moral justification for the antidrug activities of law </p>

<p> enforcement. </p>

<p> PAUL MOORE, DEVELOPMENT DIRECTOR, THE SCOTT NEWMAN CENTER, </p>

<p> Los ANGELES, CA </p>

<p> The Newman Center unequivocally opposes drug legalization. </p>

<p> The more time spent debating the issue, the more </p>

<p> credibility it receives. </p>

<p> Time should be spent developing more sound policies </p>

<p> regarding treatment, rehabilitation and prevention. </p>

<p> Society seems to be hooked on hyped miracle solutions that </p>

<p> look good but would not work. </p>

<p> Drugs, drug abuse and the associated crime are all </p>

<p> symptoms of deeply rooted problems in our society. Drugs </p>

<p> did not invent poverty, broken homes, latchkey children, </p>

<p> greed or the human desire for a quick- 'ix. Drugs did not </p>

<p> contribute to the general breakdown of moral and ethical </p>

<p> values. Without drugs, these problems would not disappear </p>

<p> and with drugs they are pronounced. </p>

<p> There is a perception that the drug problem can be </p>

<p> sanitized through legalization, giving residents of </p>

<p> ghettos and barrios all they want so long as they refrain </p>

<p> from committing crimes against the rest of society. </p>

<p> The threat of legalization is that it stands to send a </p>

<p> whole new set of mixed messages to America's youth. Drugs </p>

<p> already have a glamorous image. </p>

<p> If drugs were legalized, the gains from national efforts </p>

<p> of the past decade-such as a decrease in consumption and a </p>

<p> change in attitude of the Nation's youth-would be lost. </p>

<p> MARVIN MILLER, MEMBER, BOARD OF DIRECTORS, NORML, </p>

<p> WASHINGTON, DC </p>

<p> Drugs are a problem and they create a tremendous strain on </p>

<p> the Nation's financial resources. </p>

<p> It is commonly known that there are no funds available for </p>

<p> desperately needed educational and training programs. The </p>

<p> underground narcotics trade is being allowed to run </p>

<p> rampant and control the marketplace. It controls purity </p>

<p> as well. All iirugs are, being treated as if they are the </p>

<p> same. </p>

<p> A combined total of $10 billion is spent annually on State </p>

<p> and Federal antidrug efforts. Most of this expenditure </p>

<p> goes for enforcing marijuana possession laws. About 40 </p>

<p> percent of all drug arrests relate to marijuana. Of the </p>

<p> 40-percent figure, 9 of 10 cases involve simple </p>

<p> possession. </p>

<p> There are some 50 million marijuana smokers in the United </p>

<p> States. They are otherwise law-abiding citizens who pay </p>

<p> taxes and are productive. </p>

<p> The Nation's $10 billion antidrug budget allots only about </p>

<p> 5 percent for education programs. No money exists for </p>

<p> national education or treatment programs. </p>

<p> NORML has put together a bill to make marijuana available </p>

<p> legally as a controlled and regulated substance. </p>

<p> An administrative law judge has ruled that marijuana is </p>

<p> the most benign substance known to man. It is not </p>

<p> addictive. It does not generate violence. </p>

<p> The Nation should look at new ways to battle the drug </p>

<p> crisis. Not every drug can be legalized, yet at the same </p>

<p> time, 50 million marijuana using Americans should not be </p>

<p> branded criminals. </p>

<p> RAY WHITFIELD (RECOVERED DRUG ADDICT), DRUG ABUSE </p>

<p> CONSULTANT, WASHINGTON, DC </p>

<p> Legalization is not a positive proposal. It is based on </p>

<p> what may be a false assumption, that legalization is a </p>

<p> proposal intended to reduce drug abuse. </p>

<p> Drug-related murders would not necessarily decrease as a </p>

<p> result of legalization. Drug-related murder should take </p>

<p> into account drug related death, which is less glamorous, </p>

<p> but also a tragic consequence of drug abuse. </p>

<p> Many in our society have turned to drug abuse simply </p>

<p> because they are hopeless and helpless. Drugs ease the </p>

<p> pain of their reality. Many people have lived lives much </p>

<p> worse than what the criminal justice system can mete out. </p>

<p> The Nation's Government has been duplicitous in dealing </p>

<p> with the drug crisis. While Government does not </p>

<p> officially sanction drug use, it has pushed policies that </p>

<p> contribute to it-such as the lack of antidrug education </p>

<p> and treatment centers in ghettos during the 1940's, 1950's </p>

<p> and 1960's, and the closing of the only two Federal </p>

<p> treatment centers in Lexington, KY and Texas. </p>

<p> Drugs generally have not been considered a national </p>

<p> problem so long as there was the perception that it was a </p>

<p> problem of minoritics and poor whites. Middle and upper </p>

<p> income individuals, meanwhile, generally have looked at </p>

<p> cocaine as a suitable, nonaddictive drug. </p>

<p> Now that cocaine and its negative consequences have </p>

<p> reached suburbia, it is a national problem. This is </p>

<p> duplicity. </p>

<p> Drug abuse is not the root problem. It is a very </p>

<p> destructive symptom of other maladies. </p>

<p> SENAT0R JOSEPH GALIBER, NEW YORK STATE ASSEMBLY </p>

<p> In the last 20 years or so, little or nothing has happened </p>

<p> in terms of solving the Nation's drug crisis. </p>

<p> I introduced a bill in the State assembly earlier this </p>

<p> year to set up a commission to study legalization and </p>

<p> decriminalization in the State of New York. </p>

<p> America has always been the noble experiment on freedom </p>

<p> that other nations around the world have looked to as an </p>

<p> example. But now, out of frustration, Americans are </p>

<p> beginning to espouse violations of freedoms and civil </p>

<p> liberties as the answer to this frustration. </p>

<p> Drug trafficking must be eliminated through the </p>

<p> legalization of narcotics. </p>

<p> Responsible officials are suggesting arming our police </p>

<p> with more powerful weapons. They have suggested shooting </p>

<p> down suspicious planes. They have called for a doubling </p>

<p> of agents and resources, martial law and the death penalty </p>

<p> for drug traffickers. </p>

<p> We fail to realize the coexistence of two separate </p>

<p> problems regarding the Nation's drug crisis. There is </p>

<p> drug abuse and there is drug trafficking. It is the </p>

<p> trafficking that causes shootouts, raids, deaths and </p>

<p> injuries. If all drugs were legalized right now and given </p>

<p> away free, then the traffickers would cease coming in </p>

<p> immediately. The profit would be gone. </p>

<p> Drug abuse would not be eliminated under legalization, but </p>

<p> the horrible problems associated with the drug trade would </p>

<p> be gone. </p>

<p> The questions posed by Chairman Rangel can be answered in </p>

<p> the context of the alcohol industry: </p>

<p> Question. What narcotics and drugs would be legalized? </p>

<p> Answer. All. </p>

<p> Question. Who would be allowed to buy these narcotics? </p>

<p> Would there be an age limit? </p>

<p> Answer. The same limitations as those for purchasing </p>

<p> alcohol. </p>

<p> Question. Would we sell drugs to people who just want to </p>

<p> experiment and encourage them to pick up the habit? </p>

<p> Answer. We would sell drugs in the same fashion and with </p>

<p> the same restrictions as the selling of alcohol. </p>

<p> Question. Where would these drugs be sold? </p>

<p> Answer. In the same places and under the same controls as </p>

<p> alcohol, </p>

<p> Question. Where would we obtain our supply of these legal </p>

<p> drugs? </p>

<p> Answer. In the same way that there are manufacturers of </p>

<p> alcohol. </p>

<p> Do you for one minute think the tobacco industry has not </p>

<p> put together long ago contingency plans to produce </p>

<p> marijuana cigarettes when legalization becomes a reality? </p>

<p> Question. Would private industry be allowed to </p>

<p> participate in this market? </p>

<p> Answer. Of course. In the same way as in alcohol. </p>

<p> Question. If drugs would become legal, would we allow </p>

<p> pilots, railroad workers and nuclear plant employees to </p>

<p> use them? </p>

<p> Answer. Do we permit them to use alcohol? </p>

<p> Question. If drugs were legalized, how would we back up </p>

<p> our argument with our children and youth that drugs are </p>

<p> harmful? </p>

<p> Answer. In the same way that we do with alcohol. </p>

<p> The Volstead Act, which made liquor illegal, created </p>

<p> violence, warfare, bloodshed, corruption, illicit dealers </p>

<p> and sellers on a sale that was unprecedented until now. </p>

<p> Let us not repeat the mistakes of the past by continuing </p>

<p> to escalate a war which is totally unnecessary. </p>

<p> ADDITIONAL VIEWS OF HON. LARRY SMITH OF FLORIDA </p>

<p> Legalization will not alleviate the drug problem. Drugs </p>

<p> such as heroin and cocaine destroy both the mind and the </p>

<p> body. The new form of cocaine known as crack or rock is </p>

<p> highly addictive. Legalizing drugs would be the same as </p>

<p> admitting that we, as a people and society, cannot control </p>

<p> our actions and prefer self-destruction. Who among us </p>

<p> wants the U.S. Government to be in the business of </p>

<p> distributing cocaine, heroin, PCP or any other killing, </p>

<p> brutalizing substance? </p>

<p> Very few people believe that legalized drugs would reduce </p>

<p> the impact of drug abuse on society. Such a proposal </p>

<p> might eliminate some of the existing criminal element </p>

<p> involved in drug trafficking, but it would not stop </p>

<p> somebo4y (whether the government, tobacco companies, or </p>

<p> pharmaceutical companies) from profiting from the human </p>

<p> misery associated with drug use and abuse. </p>

<p> If we would not legalize drugs for juveniles (and we would </p>

<p> not), a flourishing market would still exist to sell to </p>

<p> them illegally. What about crime? If we distribute or </p>

<p> make legal drugs that cloud the mind or remove </p>

<p> inhibitions, does anyone believe that there will be less </p>

<p> crime? Does anyone believe that people who are on only a </p>

<p> fixed ration of free or legal drugs will not want more and </p>

<p> that someone will sell it to them illegally? And that to </p>

<p> pay for those extra&quot; drugs the drug users will not
commit </p>

<p> crimes? </p>

<p> Congress should do everything it can to eliminate drug </p>

<p> trafficking and drug abuse. The task will not be easy, </p>

<p> but that does not mean that we cannot try to alleviate </p>

<p> this devastating problem. Legalization would be the easy </p>

<p> way out, but it would not solve the underlying problem. </p>

<h1>The Anaheim Park Ordinance </h1>

<p> In our continuing effort to bring to you the news on this
issue, we ran across the following item. It seems that the city
of Anaheim, California (Disneyland, USA) decided to pass an
ordinance banning anyone who had ever been convicted of a drug
offense from visiting a public park. I could go on for hours
describing all the reasons this is a really dumb idea, but let it
suffice to say that the ordinance was repealed after the local
probation officers complained that their office was right across
from a park and the ordinance would mean that many of the people
they had to deal with would have no place to sit while waiting
for their appointments. </p>

<p> Just another outstandingly dumb approach to the drug problem.

<h1>DRUGS AND THE INFORMATION SUPERHIGHWAY </h1>

<p>[Page: E2111] </p>

<p><b>HON. GERALD B.H. SOLOMON OF NEW YORK</b> </p>

<p>in the House of Representatives </p>

<p>Thursday, October 6, 1994 </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p>Mr. SOLOMON. Mr. Speaker, it was recently brought to my
attention that drug legalization advocates are using the
electronic information superhighway to organize the legalization
movement and share information on drug use. The information
superhighway was certainly not created to propagate such
misinformation and the criminal activity associated with it. This
use was brought to my attention by drug legalization opponents
who use the information superhighway everyday in their vocations.
</p>

<p>Apparently, the National Organization for the Reform of
Marijuana Laws recently entered remarks which I personally made
in opposition to drug legalization on this House floor as an
example of `rabid, right-wing prohibitionist propaganda.' Because
I believe, along with 95 percent of America, that the use of
illicit drugs is wrong, I was singled out as an enemy of drug
users. </p>

<p>Well, Mr. Speaker, I am honored. The use of illegal drugs in
an anathema to the social and moral fabric of our Nation.
President Reagan's and President Bush's `War on Drugs ' was
premised on the belief that society was better served and
protected if our Nation universally and actively opposed drug
use. This program worked as planned. The use of cocaine,
marijuana, heroin, and most other illegal drugs declined. Our
Nation's young children and teenagers who grew up during the
1980's were told and made aware of the evils and the hardships
associated with drug use. I fear for the kind of message the
children growing up in the 1990's are receiving. Pro-drug use and
legalization messages on the information superhighway through
Internet are wrong. </p>

<p>I was appalled to learn that this information even includes
such things as tips on growing marijuana and ways to evade law
enforcement. As more and more Americans jump onto this latest
technological advancement, more and more citizens will have
access to this ill-advised information. For example, the
information superhighway is now available in most elementary and
secondary schools and in many American homes. Now elementary
students like my own grandson can obtain valuable information
about an obscure nation in the South Pacific during a social
studies class and then flip a screen to discover the glories of
drug use and criminal activity. </p>

<p>Drug legalization advocates from all over the country are
using this universal technology to further their movement and
deceive more Americans. As Congress reviews this very important
technology during the 104th Congress, the use of this service by
pro-drug organizations and individuals for the propagation of
this ilk must be addressed. As a nation founded on the freedoms
of speech and press, the rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit
of happiness must not be trampled by the disease of illegal drugs

HOLLAND HAS INCREASED CRIME AND ADDICTION </font></a></p>

<p>[Page: E499] </p>

<p><b>HON. GERALD B.H. SOLOMON OF NEW YORK</b> </p>

<p>in the House of Representatives </p>

<p>Thursday, March 2, 1995 </p>

<p><b>A Note to Readers: </b>If you want some current
information, direct from Europe, to compare with Mr. Solomon's
statements here, take a look at <a
href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~mlap/">DrugText Europe</a>. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p>Mr. SOLOMON. Mr. Speaker, let me commend to you the following
article written by a distinguished doctor and chairman of the
International Drug Strategy Institute, Eric A. Voth, M.D. Dr.
Voth advocates retaining tough drug laws to guard against rising
crime and experimentation. Citing Holland as an example, the
legalization of drugs has resulted in greatly increased crime and
addiction. The only way to combat the increase of drug use in
this country is to stand firm against recent attempt by prodrug
groups to mute public awareness. These groups attempt to disguise
the dangers of drug abuse and consequently jeopardize future
generations. </p>

<p>REPEATING HISTORY'S MISTAKES </p>

<p>The international drug policy debate rages regarding decisions
whether to fundamentally change drug policy toward legalization
or decriminalization of drug use, or to remain with restrictive
policies. If we examine two examples of softening of drug policy,
we will find ample reason to continue with restrictive policy. </p>

<p>In the mid to late 1970's during the Carter administration,
drug policy visibly softened. Several states decriminalized
marijuana, and in fact Alaska legalized marijuana. Drug policy
`specialists' in their infinite wisdom supported the flawed
concept called `responsible use' of drugs as a way that users
could maintain personal use of drugs and avoid the ravages of
addiction and physical problems. </p>

<p>Permissive drug policy originated with organizations like the
National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws. President
Carter's drug policy advisor Peter Bourne, as well as others like
Arnold Trebach, Mathea Falco, Peter Reuter, Mark Kleiman helped
to press for the lenient policy. </p>

<p>Interestingly, during that time the use of marijuana and other
drugs drastically increased. Use also increased in adolescents
despite the fact that drugs never become legal or decriminalized
for that age group. The use of marijuana among high school
students in Oregon during decriminalization was double that of
the national average. National averages of marijuana use among
high school seniors increased to 50% of seniors having used in
the previous year, and 10.7% used daily. </p>

<p>Ultimately, parents began to object to the rampant use of
drugs , especially marijuana, among their children. In the early
1980's the `parents' anti-drug movement began. Because of the
drastic failure of lenient drug policies, steady pressure was
exerted at national and local levels for restrictive drug
policies. A huge national wave of high quality research,
grassroots prevention organizations, and tightening of drug laws
began. </p>

<p>Predictably, the use of drugs among `recreational' users
dropped. High school seniors use of marijuana dropped to 23% of
seniors using within the last year and 2% using on a daily basis.
The use among hard addicts did not drop. Strangely the cry has
been sounded by some that the drug war did not work. That outcry,
however, was almost exclusively being sounded by individuals who
favored legalization or decriminalization back in the 1970's. The
same individuals who called for soft policy in the earlier era
are calling for the new harm reduction policy today. Hidden
within such policy is the intent to gain decriminalization of
drugs . </p>

<p>Holland has decriminalized drugs and tried harm reduction.
Since the softening of drug policy there, shootings have
increased 40%, robberies 62%, and car thefts 62%. This experiment
which was meant to decrease organized crime has resulted in an
increase in organized crime families from 3 in 1988 to 93 today. </p>

<p>The number of registered marijuana addicts has risen 30% and
the number of other addicts has risen 22%. </p>

<p>The major difference between today and the 1970's is that the
prolegalization effort is more organized and better funded. The
millionaire Richard Dennis from Chicago has given millions to the
drug legalization effort. Billionaire George Soros has given $6
million to the Drug Policy Foundation to help seek legalization
of drugs . He created the Open Society Fund which in turn funds
Mathea Falco's Drug Strategies organization. Steadily, these
groups put a happy and acceptable face on the idea of drug
legalization or decriminalization. </p>

<p>Their public relation campaign has softened public attitudes.
Moves such as full page ads in national newspapers suggesting
alternatives to drug policy are examples. Organized efforts at
such ideas as hemp as a fiber alternative, medical marijuana,
needle exchanges, therapeutic LSD, and others pervade the media.
The Internet is bristling with pro-drug talk groups discussing
recent drug experiences and how and where to obtain drugs . </p>

<p>In the face of these facts, the holdovers from the 70's drug
policy makers are still asking for lenient drug laws. A
substantial number of today's addicts started their use under the
lenient policies of the 1970's. We have had our experience with
decriminalization, and it is time that we recognize it and put
that concept to bed. </p>

<p>The only hope for drug policy is a concerted effort of drug
prevention which upholds the notion of no drug use, drug
interdiction, and drug treatment. If we soften our hold on an
already vexing problem, we will lose the war. </p>

<h1>America's Habit </h1>

<h2>Drug Abuse, Drug Trafficking, &amp; Organized Crime </h2>

<p><b>President's Commission on Organized Crime, 1986</b> </p>

<hr>

<h2>Overview of America's Habit </h2>

<p>This is the final report from President's Commission on
Organized Crime. It contains material on the nature, scope and
extent of organized crime, particularly as it relates to drug
trafficking, money laundering, and labor racketeering. </p>

<p>The President's Commission on Organized Crime </p>

<p>The President's Commission on Organized Crime was established
by Executive Order 12435 July 28, 1983. The Executive Order
directs the Commission to: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Make a full and complete national and region-by-region
        analysis of organized crime; </li>
    <li>Define the nature of traditional organized crime as well
        as emerging organized crime groups, the sources and
        amounts of organized crime's income, and the uses to
        which organized crime puts its income; </li>
    <li>Develop in-depth information on the participants in
        organized crime networks; </li>
    <li>Evaluate Federal laws pertinent to the effort to combat
        organized crime; </li>
    <li>Advise the President and the Attorney General with
        respect to its findings and actions which can be
        undertaken to improve law enforcement efforts directed
        against organized crime; </li>
    <li>Make recommendations concerning appropriate
        administrative and legislative improvements and
        improvements in the administration of justice; </li>
</ul>

<p>and </p>

<ul>
    <li>Report to the President from time to time as requested,
        and to submit its final report by March 1, 1986. </li>
</ul>

<p>The Commission is authorized to issue subpoenas for the
testimony of witnesses and the production of information, to
issue orders compelling testimony over a claim of the privilege
against self-incrimination, and to seek the assistance of the
Department of Justice in applying for writs of habeas corpus ad
testificandum or judicial orders requiring testimony or the
production of information before the Commission. In addition, the
Commission may obtain, use, and disclose electronic surveillance
data obtained by law enforcement agencies under Title III of the
Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, and other
information from Federal departments and agencies under the Bank
Secrecy Act and the Privacy Act of 1974, as well as from
financial institutions under the Right to Financial Privacy Act. </p>

<p>In the discharge of its responsibilities, the Commission has
prepared this report on organized crime's role in drug
trafficking and drug abuse. Based on the totality of the evidence
before it, the Commission has concluded that drug trafficking and
abuse together constitute the single most serious organized crime
issue confronting this Nation. </p>

<p>Therefore, in contrast to the other subjects covered in the
remainder of it's final report, this topic is treated in a
separate volume. The research and drafting on this report was
performed on the Commission's behalf by Chief Investigator Manuel
Gonzalez (FBI). Research assistants Abigail Johnson and Mary
Karol, Deputy Counsel Kevin McEnery, Investigator Thomas Sheehan
(DEA), and Contract Consultant Susan Mellody, under the
supervision of Deputy Executive Director Rodney G. Smith. </p>

<h1>America's Habit </h1>

<h2>Drug Abuse, Drug Trafficking, &amp; Organized Crime </h2>

<p><b>President's Commission on Organized Crime, 1986 </b></p>

<hr>

<h2>Chapter I The Impact of the Drug Trade </h2>

<p>Drug trafficking is the most serious organized crime problem
in the world today. The drug trade generates billions of dollars
for organized crime each year, imposing incalculable costs on
individuals, families, communities, and governments worldwide.
But drug trafficking is only part of a broader, unified
phenomenon, which also includes the illicit use of drugs. It is
drug users who finance organized crime through their drug
purchases, and it is they who must accept responsibility for the
broad range of costs associated with the drug industry. </p>

<p>Drug abuse ruins individual lives, drains billions of dollars
each year from American society, and erodes the nation's quality
of life. The violence and corruption that are an integral part of
organized crime drug trafficking take the lives of American and
foreign officials and private citizens, undermine drug control
efforts, and threaten entire governments. To the extent that the
stability of friendly nations is threatened, particularly in this
hemisphere, our own national security is jeopardized. The impact
of organized crime and drug trafficking on society thus has
far-ranging consequences, from the mental or physical destruction
of the individual drug user to questions of national security. </p>

<p>This Commission has found drug trafficking to be the most
widespread and lucrative organized crime activity in the United
States. According to this Commission's survey of local law
enforcement agencies, marijuana, cocaine, and dangerous drug
trafficking are the three primary activities of organized crime
groups, as defined by local agencies, nationwide. Drug
trafficking accounts for almost 38 percent of all organized crime
activity across the country and generates an income estimated to
be as high as $110 billion. </p>

<p>A concept fundamental to this report is the dual nature of the
drug phenomenon: drug supply and drug demand are mutually
dependent aspects of a single global problem. All strategic and
tactical evaluations in this report have been arrived at in this
context, and it is imperative that the planning undertaken by
this government and its allies be performed within the same
framework. The gaps that now exist between strategists who seek
to reduce supply and planners who want to reduce demand must be
closed. The situation confronting us is a crisis both nationally
and internationally. Our response can be no less than national
and international mobilization. As this report sets out in
detail, the menace of drugs is not restricted to a particular
segment of society, but is now of a scope and severity that is a
threat to our national security and therefore a legitimate
national security issue. </p>

<p>The appropriate response must therefore involve our entire
society, not just our law enforcement and health professionals.
Parents, educators, employers, the legal profession, financial
institutions, the military, and the diplomatic and intelligence
communities must all recognize that we are in a national
emergency. </p>

<p>Military strategists have warned and painful national
experience confirmed that a war must not be fought without a
clear notion of the victory sought. In this war on drugs - a
phrase worn by use but nevertheless the only accurate description
of what must be done - this Commission has adopted a definition
of victory: the dramatic reduction, if not complete elimination,
of drug abuse in this society. The ultimate goal is a distant
one, to be sure, requiring patience, determination and vision. No
less an objective is acceptable. Short fixes, compromises, and
resignation are a breach of faith with ourselves, our children,
and generations to come. </p>

<p>Just as we must clearly define victory, so must we identify
the enemy. Here again, there is no room for compromise. We must
unite against drugs themselves, and anyone who is their ally.
Producers, refiners, smugglers, and sellers, all those we know as
&quot;traffickers,&quot; are obvious targets. It is our
obligation to look further and recognize that those among us -
friends, relatives, colleagues, and other &quot;respectable&quot;
people - whose small, personal drug purchases at the base of the
consumption pyramid are the driving force behind the traffickers'
assault on this country. It is the consumer's dollars that come
together to finance the organized crime drug trafficking
described in this report, and it is thus their responsibility and
ours to confront this truth. This means an end to tolerance of
drug use at every level of society. </p>

<p>While all drug trafficking, by its nature, requires some
degree of organization, it is essential for the purposes of this
report to identify the threshold at which the organization
inherent in drug trafficking can be distinguished from organized
crime drug trafficking. The Commission's definition of organized
crime, which sets out the six characteristics of organized crime
groups, is helpful in making this distinction. These
characteristics are: continuity, structure, defined membership,
criminality, violence, and power as its goal. These elements,
together with a reliance on the &quot;buffer&quot; that this
Commission has found to be an integral part of organized crime,
are common to the world's most notorious trafficking
organizations. </p>

<p>This report examines the organized crime groups that traffic
in illicit drugs. To the extent necessary to grasp the dynamics
of worldwide drug traffic, it also details the nature of the
drugs themselves. It describes the array of enforcement agencies
currently in place, analyzes their various strategies and
tactics, and presents specific recommendations for more effective
anti-drug efforts. </p>

<p>In the portion of this report devoted to efforts to reduce the
supply of illicit drugs, &quot;Supply Strategies,&quot; it is
clear that our law enforcement and other government agencies,
particularly on the Federal level, are deployed with a degree of
determination, imagination, and resource commitment unparalleled
in American history. This government must continue to pursue
strategies to reduce supply with all possible vigor, or it is the
government's obligation to do all within its power to protect its
citizens, no matter how formidable the foe. Nevertheless, if the
demand for illicit drugs continues at its present voracious
level, improvements in the area of reducing supply will continue
to be slow, expensive, infrequent, and too often only temporary. </p>

<p>This report places great emphasis on the need for complete
national resolve in this area and for that resolve to be
translated into fully coordinated governmental action.
Compartmentalization and parochialism, which have been far too
common in past efforts, must be brought to an end. In this
regard, we are at a particularly propitious moment in history.
The slow and painful evolution of our strategy has finally
achieved a centralized authority for our national effort: the
National Drug Enforcement Policy Board. Not just another advisory
body, this Board is a true congregation of every component of our
national government's anti-drug effort. It provides the means for
achieving a thoroughly coordinated national attack on every
aspect of drug trafficking and abuse. It is vital that the Policy
Board move effectively, thoughtfully and decisively, but it is
most urgent that it move. Indecisiveness are signals in
themselves, the wrong signals, to drug traffickers, users,
concerned parents, health and social planners, and even foreign
governments. Perhaps most critically, indecisiveness and delay
are the wrong signals to those U.S. governmental agencies that
must choose where anti-drug efforts will fall on the list of
competing priorities in a time of hardening fiscal austerity. By
action, not mere promises, the Policy Board must send the proper
message: we are in a fight for our lives, and every agency must
arrange its priorities accordingly. </p>

<p>Our strategies to reduce supply will require not only
dedication, but patience and objectivity. The war against drugs
will not be won until individuals stop using them. Strategies to
reduce supply can do no more than hold the line against illegal
drugs while public attitudes and private choices change. That is
not to say that our enforcement strategies should not be
aggressive and persistent. On the contrary, this report makes
clear that there is much in this area that is being done and
should continue, and much more that might be done. Many of the
specific recommendations in this report are devoted to this
theme. What is necessary at the outset, however, is an
understanding that such efforts must not be judged by an
unrealistic standard. As long as this society is willing to
provide its enforcement agencies scarcely more than a penny for
every dollar our citizens squander on illicit drugs, it has no
right and no reason to expect more. </p>

<p>Ultimately, the curse of drug abuse will be broken, but only
by a nationwide dedication to persistent and unyielding assaults
on both supply and demand. The supply is already under siege by
our enforcement, diplomatic, and intelligence communities.
Because an end to consumption is our ultimate goal, it is a
concerted and direct attack on demand that must be mounted. </p>

<p>Illicit drugs are an attack upon the integrity, character, and
health of the individual. Although discussions of drugs are often
framed in terms of costs to society and society's responses, the
fact is that individuals, not societies, take drugs. It is the
individual user who finances all of the violence, corruption, and
degradation that this report describes. The powerful,
sophisticated, and thoroughly evil organized crime drug
trafficking groups described herein are a reflection of nothing
more than our self-destructiveness. It is as a result of
individual acts of will that such groups came to be and are
sustained, and it is by individual acts of will that they will
finally be defeated. <br>

<h2>Chapter II Portrait of Drug Production and Use </h2>

<p>Cocaine Scope of the Problem </p>

<p>Once considered a fashionable drug for the wealthy, cocaine
and its deleterious effects are now beginning to be better
understood. In the past scientists made a clear distinction
between physical and psychological drug dependence, but the
health and social consequences of cocaine use have demonstrated
that the two courses lead to the same end: cocaine, like other
addictive drugs, ruins lives and kills. Widely available across
the United States, cocaine is now used by individuals of all
socioeconomic groups. The cocaine industry generates an estimated
$11 billion in illicit income annually, and it is growing.
Cocaine production, importation to the United States and
consumption have all increased significantly in recent years. The
cocaine industry is fueled by the approximately 25 million
Americans who have tried cocaine, of which five to six million
use it at least once per month. Of the regular users, it is
estimated that almost half may be considered addicted. Although
the total number of users appears to have leveled off in the last
few years, cocaine consumption has increased 12 percent between
1983 and 1984, from 50-68 metric tons to 55-76 metric tons. As
cocaine consumption has increased, so too have more dangerous
forms of use of the drug and the deleterious effects associated
with it. Cocaine-related deaths increased 77 percent from 1983 to
1984 and cocaine-related emergency room visits increased 51
percent. Requests for treatment for cocaine use have increased
600 percent during the past three years. In 18 states, cocaine is
reported as the primary drug of abuse for clients in treatment
facilities. There is no indication that without a comprehensive
effort at reduction of both the supply of and demand for cocaine,
the increases in cocaine use or its deleterious medical and
social effects will subside in the near future. From a law
enforcement perspective, the consequences of this tolerance and
addiction are the intense, steady and increasing demand for the
product, which generates vast revenues for organized crime.
Today's Cocaine User </p>

<p>The cocaine industry is sustained by the appetite of the
cocaine user. With the possible exception of marijuana, cocaine
is used by a wider demographic cross-section of society than any
other controlled substance. Facts demonstrate that the popular
belief that cocaine use is restricted to the wealthy is a myth.
For example, a study of 6,406 males arrested for serious crimes
and processed in New York City's Manhattan Central Booking police
office in 1984 reveals that 42 percent tested positively for
cocaine in their system, the drug most frequently detected. The
use of cocaine in combination with other drugs appears to be
increasing. Fifty-nine percent of the cocaine-related deaths in
1984 involved other drugs, particularly alcohol, heroin and PCP.
In addition, more dangerous routes of cocaine administration are
now being used. Use of &quot;speedballs,&quot; injections of
heroin and cocaine, which are often lethal, increased 37 percent
from 1983 to 1984. Smoking of coca paste and base, forms of
consumption with particularly dangerous health consequences, have
also increased. Surveys of cocaine users demonstrated there is no
&quot;typical&quot; cocaine user. Results of a 1983 survey of
callers to the national 800-COCAINE hotline indicate that the
average caller was a 31-year old, white, middle class male with
at least some college education and a job with an annual salary
exceeding $25,000. Results of the 1985 survey of callers to the
hotline reveal that more women, minorities and adolescents called
than just two years earlier, and 73 percent of callers in 1985
reported an income of less than $25,000 per year. While almost
half of the calls to the hotline in 1983 came from the northeast,
calls were fairly evenly geographically distributed in 1985. Just
as it has spread geographically and to different socioeconomic
groups, cocaine use has increased among certain age groups. Most
alarmingly, an increase in adolescent use of cocaine has been
reported in the 1984 and 1985 surveys of drug use among high
school seniors. The surveys found that current use of cocaine
among respondents climbed from 4.9 percent in 1983 to 5.8 percent
in 1984, and to 6.7 percent 1985. According to the surveys,
annual and lifetime use of cocaine also increased. Health
Consequences of Cocaine Use One reason that use of cocaine is so
widespread is because of the properties of the drug itself.
Cocaine is derived from the leaves of the coca plant
(Erythroxylon coca) and has been identified by Dr. Donald Ian
MacDonald, administrator of the Alcohol, Drug Abuse and Mental
Health Administration, as one of the most powerfully addictive
substances known to man. Cocaine is a stimulant traditionally
used to produce euphoria. Other initial effects, however,
typically include excitation, increased alertness, insomnia, loss
of appetite, increased heart rate, increased respiration and
increased blood pressure after even one use. Death can also
result from first time use as discussed below. Repeated use of
cocaine can cause chronic fatigue, convulsions, depression,
irritability, loss of sex drive, memory problems, nasal bleeding,
paranoia, severe headaches, increased body temperature and death.
These symptoms are neither theoretical nor infrequent. Chronic
cocaine use causes tolerance, withdrawal symptoms and addiction.
Tolerance is evidenced by the fact that chronic cocaine users
need to increase their dosage of cocaine to achieve the same
effects as lower dosages. As dosage increases, the effect of
cocaine use become more pronounced. According to cocaine
researcher Dr. Reese T. Jones, &quot;The existence of a true
withdrawal syndrome following cocaine use seems compelling.&quot;
This syndrome includes &quot;depression, social withdrawal,
craving, tremor, muscle pain, eating disturbance,
encephalographic changes and changes in sleep patterns.&quot; </p>

<p>The addictive nature of cocaine and its toxicity have been
documented in both animal studies and human experience. According
to the results of a study reported in the July 5, 1985 issue of
the Journal of the American Medical Association, 90 percent of
rats self-administering cocaine intravenously died within 30
days, while the mortality rate for rats self-administering heroin
was only 36 percent. The study found that rats using cocaine lost
up to 47 percent of their body weight, ceased grooming themselves
and deteriorated in general health. Several rats experienced
seizures, but immediately self-administered more cocaine after
the cessation of convulsions. The study concludes that in regard
to human cocaine use: As the intake of cocaine increases and the
concentration of this compound becomes greater (through the
availability of higher-purity drugs, by IV injections or by
'free-basing') the number of fatalities associated with cocaine
abuse is likely to increase. Hundreds of fatalities each year are
associated with cocaine use. According to Dr. Mark Gold, director
of research at Fair Oaks Hospital in New Jersey: &quot;We have no
way of predicting who'll die from the drug and who won't. It
could be a regular user or it could be a first-time user.&quot;
Although overdose is the primary cause of cocaine deaths, death
can also result after a regular cocaine user takes the same
amount of the drug that he usually takes. This phenomenon is
known as &quot;kindling&quot; and is not well understood by
scientists. According to Miami's Deputy Chief Medical Examiner
Dr. Charles Wetli, &quot;What was a safe dose one day becomes a
fatal dose the next.&quot; The precise cause of cocaine-related
deaths, regardless of dosage, include respiratory failure,
cerebral hemorrhage, cardiac arrest or seizures. Because cocaine
increases blood pressure and heart rate, individuals with
cardiovascular problems are at particular risk. Cocaine's
tendency to induce convulsions also creates special risks for
epileptics. Death by cocaine is often preceded by anxiety,
hallucinations, high body temperature and seizures. One common
myth about cocaine is that addiction and death cannot result from
intranasal use, or &quot;snorting,&quot; which is the most common
route of administration. While cocaine deaths are usually
associated with intravenous use, coroners have documented cases
of death from intranasal use of cocaine. One particular danger
associated with intravenous use of cocaine, or any drug, is
infection. Hepatitis and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome
(AIDS) have both been associated with intravenous drug use.
Cultivation The cultivation, refinement and trafficking necessary
to bring cocaine from the fields of South America to the streets
of the United States obviously requires organization. Coca bushes
are grown primarily in the South American countries of Peru,
Bolivia and Colombia. The plants are first harvested as early as
18 months after planting, and can usually be harvested from three
to four times annually for up to 20 years. The cultivation of
coca has increased significantly in recent years, primarily as a
result of the cultivation of new coca plants and the maturation
of previously existing coca plants. Notwithstanding increased law
enforcement pressure in Colombia, the tremendous profits
associated with cocaine trafficking have encouraged the spread of
coca cultivation throughout the region. Processing In a
relatively simple chemical process, coca leaves are converted
first to cocaine paste, then base, then cocaine hydrochloride
(HCl), the form of coca most commonly abused in this country. The
conversion of leaf to paste to base usually occurs near the
cultivation site. The dried leaves are first moistened in an
alkaline solution and then soaked in kerosene. The kerosene is
removed leaving a cocaine precipitate. This in turn is filtered,
producing a paste. The paste is dissolved in a solution of
sulfuric acid and then potassium permanganate. This mixture is
then filtered, ammonium hydroxide is added and the precipitate
that forms is coca base. Traditionally, base has been smuggled
out of Peru and Bolivia by small aircraft or boats to Colombia,
where most of the refining from base to HCl takes place. In
numerous cocaine laboratories in the jungles of Colombia, coca
base is transformed into pure cocaine HCl by adding ether and
acetone, and filtering this mixture, which is then dried. To
produce one kilo of pure cocaine, approximately 500 kilos of coca
leaves are needed. The pattern of processing and transshipment is
somewhat different from that of cultivation. In the area of
refining and smuggling cocaine, it is estimated that 75 percent
of the drug available in the United States comes from Colombia,
15 percent from Bolivia, 5 percent from Peru and 5 percent from
Ecuador, Argentina, Brazil, and Chile. However, these figures are
subject to frequent changes because of the mobility of drug
traffickers. For example, while most of the conversion to HCl
takes place in Colombia, and other South American countries, an
increasing number of cocaine laboratories are being seized in the
United States. Six such laboratories were seized here in 1982, 11
in 1983, 21 in 1984 and 25 during the first half of 1985. Reasons
for this trend include increased law enforcement in Colombia and
the increasing cost of ether and acetone in Colombia. The cost of
these chemicals has increased as a result of controls imposed by
the Colombian government on their importation and sale and a
concerted effort initiated by the U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration to disrupt the supply of chemicals essential in
the cocaine refinement process. A 55-gallon drum of ether now
costs approximately $7,000 in South America, while the same
amount costs only $500 to $600 in the United States. Further,
acetone and ether are widely available for commercial purposes in
the United States, making control of their illicit use much more
difficult than it has been in South America. </p>

<p>Heroin </p>

<p>Scope of the Problem </p>

<p>Traditionally viewed as the &quot;hardest drug,&quot; heroin's
reputation is well-earned. Although there are fewer heroin
addicts than users of other illicit drugs, more deaths and
emergency room visits are associated with heroin than with any
other drug. Heroin's &quot;worst drug&quot; status has also
developed because of the crime generally associated with heroin
use, a stereotype of the heroin addict as an inner-city street
dweller who commits crimes as his sole means of support, the fact
that heroin is most often used intravenously, the dramatic
addiction and withdrawal symptoms associated with use of the
drug, and the relatively quick and generally lethal effects of a
heroin overdose. </p>

<p>The Drug Enforcement Administration estimates there were
490,000 heroin addicts and users in 1981. It is estimated that
thousands more individuals use heroin occasionally, but are not
included in this number. While the addict population has remained
relatively steady since 1979, indicators of heroin consumption
and effects have increased in recent years. Annual heroin-related
deaths reached 1,046 in 1984, a 31 percent increase from 1983.
Emergency room visits involving heroin use increased 55 percent
from 1981 to 1984, with 10,901 such visits in 1984. This
represents a decrease from the 11,028 emergency room visits in
1983. Estimated heroin consumption increased 55 percent from 1981
to 1984, with 5.97 metric tons of heroin consumed in 1984. As a
result of increased heroin purity and increased use of the drug
in combination with other drugs, the number of heroin addicts and
the number of deaths and emergency room visits associated with
heroin use should be expected to increase. </p>

<p>Heroin is thus an extremely valuable commodity for organized
crime: in fact, an ounce of pure heroin is approximately ten
times more expensive than an ounce of gold. Heroin users provide
organized crime with billions of dollars each year: it is
estimated that illegal income from heroin sales in the United
States totaled $6.12 billion in 1982. </p>

<p>The Heroin Addict </p>

<p>Historically, data collection and law enforcement experience
support the view that heroin use has been an urban phenomenon,
confined in large part to minority populations. One recent study
of black inner-city heroin users across the country suggests the
extent of heroin's grip in those areas: </p>

<p>Because of the regular availability of heroin and the
structure of the relationship of intercity residents to society,
the heroin lifestyle has become firmly established as an
alternative lifestyle for Black youngsters. </p>

<p>Such studies typically reveal a portrait of the heroin addict
as an unemployed, minority male with little education who commits
crime to support his habit: A 1985 study of heroin users in East
and Central Harlem found the following: 75 percent were male; 55
percent were black and 44 percent Hispanic; 36 percent were under
30 years of age; 61 percent had less than 11 years of education;
and 81 percent were unemployed. The annualized crime rate for
these heroin users was 1,075 crimes per person. Crimes committed
by heroin addicts includes property crime, violent crime and drug
offenses. </p>

<p>While regular use of heroin is generally addictive, there
appears to be a group of users, known as &quot;chippers,&quot;
who are able to use heroin occasionally over a long period of
time without becoming addicts. In his study of heroin, Stanford
University professor John Kaplan maintains: </p>

<p>It is now clear that there exists a sizable population of
non-addicted but regular heroin users who seem well integrated
into society and in many ways indistinguishable from the rest of
the population. </p>

<p>Recently a new group of heroin users has emerged that includes
both addicts and non-addicts. These are the &quot;middle
class&quot; users, who are involved with heroin as a result of
their cocaine habits. In order to counteract the effects of heavy
cocaine use, many began to use heroin intranasally, and
eventually became addicted to the drug. Dr. Forest Tennant,
director of a number of drug abuse clinics in the Los Angeles
area, observes: </p>

<p>As cocaine use increases, we're seeing more addicts because
heroin is the strongest neutralizer around for cocaine toxicity .
. . And we're not talking about gang members and derelicts. I'm
treating people who pay their union dues, go to the PTA, take
their kids to Little League. We've even got a program for
executives. </p>

<p>Health Effects of Heroin Use </p>

<p>While narcotics serve an essential medicinal purpose as
analgesics, or painkillers, they are often abused. Heroin, the
most abused opiate, is derived from the opium poppy (Papaver
somniferum). Heroin is generally used intravenously, the most
efficient and dangerous route of administration.
&quot;Speedballs,&quot; injections of heroin mixed with cocaine,
are particularly dangerous. Heroin can also be used
subcutaneously, called &quot;skin-popping.&quot; All of these
intravenous forms of use are associated with AIDS and hepatitis,
as discussed earlier. In addition, heroin can be smoked or used
intranasally. </p>

<p>Heroin is a particularly dangerous drug because of the ease
with which a user can overdose, A lethal dose of heroin is only
10 to 15 times a normal dose. According to Dr. Donald C. Thomas
III, former director of emergency care at the District of
Columbia General Hospital: </p>

<p>Heroin numbs you to pain, gives you a euphoria, takes you away
from reality, makes you slower and changes appetites . . . The
real problem for an addict is that the threshold between the dose
of heroin that gives that effect, as opposed to the dose that
will kill him by suppressing respiratory or cardiac centers in
his brain, is very narrow. </p>

<p>Multiple overdose deaths sometimes result from one
&quot;batch&quot; of heroin. In March 1985, for example,
according to local press accounts, 8 people died and 14 were
hospitalized in a few days in Washington, D.C., after injecting
some particularly potent heroin. Seven months earlier, 10 people
died in Washington within 8 days in a similar incident. It is
striking evidence of the drug's overpowering influence that this
risk of sudden death apparently poses no deterrent to the
seasoned user. As expressed by one heroin addict: </p>

<p>A true, full-blown drug addict would follow a morgue wagon to
its origin of overdose to obtain that substance. </p>

<p>Cultivation </p>

<p>Heroin entering the United States is produced from opium
poppies, which are harvested in Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan
(Southwest Asia, the Golden Crescent); Burma, Thailand and Laos
(Southeast Asia, the Golden Triangle); and Mexico. In 1984, an
estimated 51 percent of United States heroin came from Southwest
Asia, 32 percent from Mexico and 17 percent from Southeast Asia. </p>

<p>From 1983 to 1984 illicit opium production decreased in
Southwest Asia. This change resulted from decreased figures for
opium production in Afghanistan caused by adverse weather
conditions and a change in the methodology used to estimate opium
production in Afghanistan. While total opium production for
Southwest Asia decreased in 1984, significant production
increases were noted in Southeast Asia and Mexico. </p>

<p>Opium poppy cultivation has begun to appear in the United
States as well. During a Federal raid in August 1985, more than
4,000 opium plants were discovered in Vermont, Washington,
Michigan and California. Although officials of the Drug
Enforcement Administration believe this opium was used for
smoking, the potential for domestic heroin production exists. </p>

<p>While America's heroin addict population has remained
relatively stable, the problem of heroin addiction in Europe has
increased significantly in recent years. According to a 1984
United Nations report: </p>

<p>The drug abuse and trafficking situation in Western Europe is
grim and deteriorating . . . Western Europe remains seriously
affected by heroin abuse which is a major public health problem. </p>

<p>The number of heroin addicts in the opium producing and other
countries is also significant. </p>

<p>There is a greater sense of the need for international
cooperation on the problem of drugs, in part because drug
producing nations are now feeling the effects of drug abuse, with
which the industrialized world has dealt for decades. This
development is critical if drug control efforts, including crop
eradication, interdiction and drug education, are to be
successful. </p>

<p>Processing </p>

<p>The production of heroin begins after the petals of the opium
poppy flower have fallen. Several incisions are then made in the
seed pod from which sap oozes. The sap dries, darkens and becomes
gummy, and is scraped from the pod. This dried sap is raw opium.
Each pod can be incised up to five different times. </p>

<p>To produce one kilogram of heroin, a precipitating agent is
added to 10-12 kilograms of opium. This mixture is pressed,
leaving one kilogram of morphine base. This base is treated with
acetic anhydride, which yields one kilogram of heroin. In another
production method, poppies are allowed to mature and dry.
Alkaloids are then extracted from these plants leaving poppy
straw concentrate, which is sold in a brownish powder form. </p>

<p>Marijuana </p>

<p>Scope of the Problem </p>

<p>According to the most recent National Survey on Drug Abuse,
which was conducted in 1982, 50-60 million Americans,
approximately 20-25 percent of the entire population, have tried
marijuana; and 20 million people use the drug at least once per
month. Marijuana use has been widespread in this country for the
last two decades. Both the number of users and the duration of
marijuana's popularity indicate that marijuana use is firmly
entrenched in American society. </p>

<p>Although some surveys indicate that the number of marijuana
users has been declining recently, levels of use remain
significantly higher than for any other illicit drug. The
National Survey on Drug Abuse indicates a decline in marijuana
use for some age groups. Yet the survey shows that in 1982, 11.5
percent of 12-17-year-olds and 27 percent of 18-25 year olds used
marijuana at least once per month. The study indicates a slight,
but steady, increase in marijuana use among people over age 25.
In 1977, 3.3 percent reported monthly marijuana use, compared
with 6.0 percent in 1982. According to the survey of high school
seniors conducted each year by the University of Michigan
Institute for Social Research, marijuana use among high school
seniors peaked in 1978, when 37 percent of these students
reported monthly use of marijuana and 11 percent reported daily
use of the drug. By 1984 these figures had dropped to 25 percent
and 5 percent respectively. However, this decline in marijuana
use ended in 1985 when 26 percent of the survey respondents
reported monthly marijuana use. </p>

<p>Marijuana consumption and the number of marijuana-associated
emergency room visits have remained relatively steady in recent
years. In 1984 Americans consumed an estimated 7,800-9,200 metric
tons of marijuana, as compared with 8,000-9,600 metric tons in
1983. Use of marijuana in conjunction with other drugs,
particularly PCP, diazepam and cocaine, increased in 1984. </p>

<p>The Marijuana User </p>

<p>Marijuana is probably used by a wider demographic
cross-section of American society than any other drug. This
widespread use was recognized by the 1972 National Commission on
Marihuana [sic] and Drug Abuse: </p>

<p>The stereotype of the marihuana [sic] user as a marginal
citizen has given way to a composite picture of large segments of
American youth, children of the dominant majority and very much
part of the mainstream of American life. </p>

<p>While it appears that marijuana, like other drugs, is most
commonly used by those between the ages of 18 and 25, its use is
by no means confined to that age group. One analysis of marijuana
use found that: </p>

<p>Marijuana is now found at the Friday afternoon brainstorming
sessions of a New York publishing house. In the cabs of long-haul
trucks. In the office of a president of a cosmetic firm. Even, it
is alleged, among executives of major American banks. </p>

<p>According to the 1982 National Survey on Drug Abuse, 23
percent of 16 and 17 year olds, 8 percent of 14 and 15 year olds,
and 2 percent of 12 and 13 year olds used marijuana at least once
per month. Surveys have indicated marijuana use in children as
young as nine years old. </p>

<p>Health Effects of Marijuana Use </p>

<p>Marijuana includes any part of the plant Canabis sativa. In
addition to marijuana, the following forms of cannabis are also
abused: hashish, a resin of the plant; hashish oil, a liquid
concentrate derived from cannabis; and sinsemilla, from the
female cannabis plant. </p>

<p>The effects of marijuana use have been the subject of
exaggeration and misunderstanding for decades. In 1936, for
example, the film &quot;Reefer Madness&quot; portrayed those
effects as instant violence and insanity. In 1972 the National
Commission on Marihuana [sic] and Drug Abuse embraced the
opposite extreme: </p>

<p>No conclusive evidence exists of any physical damage,
disturbances of bodily processes or proven human fatalities
attributable solely to even high doses of marijuana . . . [The]
few consistently observed transient effects on bodily function
seem to suggest that marihuana [sic] is a rather unexciting
compound of negligible immediate toxicity at the doses usually
consumed in this country. </p>

<p>Both views have been refuted by medical evidence gathered
since the early 1970's. Today marijuana is described as &quot;the
most chemically complex of all commonly used illegal drugs.&quot;
Marijuana contains 421 known chemicals, which when smoked are
combusted into more than 2,000 chemical compounds. Marijuana is
variously classified as a stimulant, depressant and hallucinogen
because its effects vary among users. </p>

<p>Those chemicals found only in cannabis are called
cannabinoids. The primary intoxicant in marijuana is
delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). The concentration of The in
marijuana has steadily increased over the last decade as a result
of improved agricultural techniques. Analysis of marijuana
samples indicates that the average percentage of The in marijuana
has increased from .7 percent in 1973, to 3.1 percent in 1982, to
5.6 percent in 1983. The potencies have been reported as high as
14 percent in domestically produced sinsemilla. </p>

<p>Since 1967 when the first intensive government research
program on marijuana began, over 7,000 scientific papers have
been published on the subject. Contrary to the findings of the
1972 National Commission on Marihuana and Drug Abuse, adverse
physical and psychological effects associated with marijuana use
have been demonstrated. The measurement of long-term effects of
marijuana use are at present problematic because marijuana
smoking has been prevalent in the United States for only
approximately 15 to 20 years, shorter than the latency period for
many marijuana-related diseases. In the case of tobacco it was
not until after 50 years of heavy use that there was ample
evidence to issue warnings about its effects. </p>

<p>Despite the common public perception that marijuana is less
harmful than tobacco, scientific evidence indicates that
marijuana, in fact, causes substantially more adverse health
effects, due in part to the properties of the drug itself and the
manner in which it is smoked. Marijuana is not filtered, as are
most tobacco cigarettes, and marijuana smoke is generally inhaled
more deeply and held in the lungs longer than tobacco smoke.
Marijuana smoke has been found to contain many of the same
chemicals as tobacco smoke; indeed it has 50 percent more of
cancer-causing hydrocarbons than tobacco smoke. </p>

<p>According to the American Lung Association, marijuana smoking
harms the lungs and may cause bronchitis, emphysema and lung
cancer. Evidence supporting this conclusion has been building for
a number of years. For example, a 1976 study reported that
examinations of human lung tissue &quot;have found malignant
cellular changes after shorter periods of exposure to marijuana
smoke than to tobacco smoke.&quot; One comprehensive review of
marijuana projects that: </p>

<p>Starting in the latter 1980's, we predict an increase in the
rate of lung cancer among middle-aged people, representing the
marijuana epidemic that began in the mid-sixties. Those smoking
both tobacco and marijuana are most at risk. </p>

<p>Marijuana use can also adversely affect both male and female
reproduction. Marijuana use by pregnant women is particularly
dangerous and has been linked to lowered birth weight, fetal
abnormalities and nervous disorders in offspring. These adverse
physical effects are magnified because cannabinoids, being fat
soluble, collect in the fatty organs of the body, such as the
testis or ovaries, brain and liver. This is of particular concern
because marijuana is used by a large population of young people
whose lungs, reproductive organs, and other parts of their bodies
are still maturing and are particularly vulnerable to the adverse
effects of drugs. </p>

<p>In addition to these physical effects of marijuana use,
several psychological and behavioral effects have also been
associated with the drug. These behavioral changes have been
called &quot;the amotivational syndrome.&quot; Although lack of
motivation may often precede marijuana use, many clinicians have
concluded that: </p>

<p>Motivational effects are directly related to use and . . .
following cessation of marijuana use normal motivation may
return. </p>

<p>In addition to the effects of marijuana on motivation,
marijuana use has been found to affect short-term memory,
concentration, and logical thinking. A 1982 report concerning the
impact of marijuana use on education concludes that: </p>

<p>Every element of learning is incompatible with either the
acute intoxication or the chronic mental change that marijuana
use can bring. </p>

<p>A 1980 study reported that use of marijuana 20 times or more
per month is &quot;positively correlated with absenteeism and
poor school achievement among high school seniors.&quot; These
conclusions are particularly disturbing given the fact that tens
of thousands, perhaps even hundreds of thousands, of adolescents
use marijuana every day. </p>

<p>A final concern in this area, marijuana's role as a
&quot;gateway&quot; to subsequent use of more dangerous drugs,
cannot be categorized as either physical or psychological. While
many beliefs about marijuana have been proven wrong by subsequent
research, this concept has been affirmed. This
&quot;gateway&quot; theory does not indicate that marijuana use
will definitely lead to the use of other drugs; however,
according to a review of marijuana studies conducted by the
Department of Health and Human Services, </p>

<p>Statistically, there is little question that use, particularly
heavier use, is associated with a likelihood of experimentation
with other drugs. </p>

<p>Synthetic Drugs </p>

<p>Scope of the Problem </p>

<p>Many illicit drugs do not occur naturally. Unlike cocaine,
heroin and marijuana, which are derived from plants, synthetic
drugs are produced solely from chemicals. These synthetic drugs
include stimulants, depressants and hallucinogens, known as
dangerous drugs; synthetic narcotics, such as methadone; and
controlled substance analogs, often called &quot;designer
drugs.&quot; A controlled substance analog has a chemical
structure similar to a controlled substance, and is designed to
produce a similar effect. </p>

<p>Use of synthetic drugs is widespread in the United States.
More than six million Americans used synthetic drugs for
non-medical purposes in 1982. Over 2.5 million people abused
depressants, approximately 2.8 million abused stimulants, and
almost 1 million abused hallucinogens. Consumption of
&quot;dangerous drugs&quot; increased 15 percent between 1983 and
1984, from an estimated 2.66 billion dosage units to 3.06 billion
dosage units. The greatest increases were associated with
methamphetamine and phencyclidine (PCP). Methamphetamine-related
emergency room visits increased 20 percent from 1983 to 1984, and
deaths associated with both amphetamine and methamphetamine also
increased in 1984. </p>

<p>Statistics regarding the use of controlled substance analogs
are difficult to compile. This is because the use of these
substances is a relatively new phenomenon, and medical examiners
have generally failed to identify controlled substance analogs as
a cause of death. Despite these difficulties, one synthetic
analog has been responsible for the deaths of at least 100 people
on the West Coast. While most of these deaths occurred in
California, many law enforcement authorities fear that production
and use of controlled substance analogs might spread across the
country because of the ease of production and large profit margin
associated with these drugs. This spread has already occurred in
at least one instance: drug treatment program directors in
California, Florida, New York, Texas and Virginia have reported
cases of use of the controlled substance analog MDMA. </p>

<p>Synthetic Drug Users </p>

<p>While synthetic drugs are used for a wide range of medicinal
purposes, they are also widely abused by individuals from all
socioeconomic groups. According to a 1978 study of individuals in
treatment for stimulant and/or depressant drug abuse, 68 percent
were men, 61 percent were white, 20 percent black and 19 percent
of another ethnicity, 59 percent were unemployed, 77 percent had
previously been treated for drug abuse, 59 percent were 25 years
of age or older, and 46 percent had less than a twelfth grade
education. </p>

<p>While most people associate heroin use with crime, a 1982
study by the RAND Corporation found violent crime to be committed
most often by multi-drug users, particularly those using
combinations including dangerous drugs. Certain synthetic drugs
are particularly associated with crime. A study of all arrestees
in Washington, D.C., from May 1984 to April 1985 found that PCP,
an hallucinogen, is the drug most often detected in these
arrestees. An average of over 30 percent of all adults arrested
in Washington, D.C., during this period tested positive for PCP
use. A study of almost 5,000 male arrestees in New York City in
1984 found that 12 percent of those arrested had PCP in their
bodies. </p>

<p>Health Effects of Synthetic Drug Use </p>

<p>Tolerance to stimulants develops quickly. Because of the
&quot;crash,&quot; or depression, followed by stimulant use,
users tend to take stimulants more often in order to compensate
for or avoid the post-stimulant letdown. Stimulant users are
subject to a vicious cycle in which they must take depressants at
night to be able to reverse the stimulant's effects. Stimulants
can cause physical dependence and death. Withdrawal is
characterized by depression, fatigue and excessive sleep, which
may last for several days. Other withdrawal symptoms, including
anxiety and thoughts of suicide, may last for weeks or months. </p>

<p>Depressants can also cause tolerance and physical dependence.
Abuse of depressants is marked by impaired judgment, slurred
speech and loss of motor coordination. Depressants are
particularly dangerous when used in combination with alcohol or
other drugs. Heavy use of depressants can cause a weak, rapid
pulse, shallow respiration, coma and death. </p>

<p>Hallucinogens alter mood, and, in large doses, cause delusions
and hallucinations. This impaired judgment can lead a user to
physically harm himself or others. &quot;Flashbacks,&quot; in
which the user has a brief recurrence of the psychedelic effects
of hallucinogens, sometimes occur long after the drug is used.
Tolerance and psychological dependence can also result. PCP,
often called &quot;Angel Dust,&quot; is one of the most dangerous
and widely abused hallucinogens. Reactions to PCP are
unpredictable and include euphoria, depression, anxiety or panic.
PCP use is associated with extremely violent behavior, including
assault, rape, and murder. Feelings of omnipotence sometimes lead
a PCP user to suicidal behavior, including walking in front of
moving vehicles or jumping out of windows. </p>

<p>Controlled substance analogs are designed to mimic the effects
of various drugs and are particularly dangerous because of their
toxicity. One synthetic analog, 3-methyl fentanyl, is up to 1,000
times more potent than morphine. According to Dr. Robert J.
Roberton of California's Department of Alcohol and Drug Programs,
&quot;You could kill 50 people with the amount that fits on the
head of a pin.&quot; </p>

<p>Fentanyl analogs, the most commonly abused controlled
substance analogs, produce a feeling of euphoria similar to that
associated with heroin use. These drugs also produce respiratory
depression and muscle rigidity. MPTP, which is a synthetic analog
of the narcotic meperidine, causes brain damage, Parkinson's
disease and death. Although Parkinson's disease usually strikes
people in their fifties and sixties, people of various ages, who
have used MPTP, have contracted the disease, which causes slowed
movement, tremors, rigidity, dementia and death. The neurological
damage associated with use of MPTP is irreversible. </p>

<p>Drug Abuse Fuels Drug Trafficking </p>

<p>Drug abuse in the United States is a problem of vast and
growing proportions Millions of Americans use cocaine, heroin,
marijuana, or synthetic drugs, or combinations of these drugs.
Consumption of cocaine and dangerous drugs has increased recently
as have the deleterious health effects associated with then. The
downward trend in marijuana use which began in 1979 appears to
have ended at least temporarily in 1985. </p>

<p>Particularly dangerous forms of drug use have increased during
the last few years. Use of &quot;crack,&quot; coca base which is
smoked and which has been called the most potent, addictive, and
cheapest form of cocaine, has become prevalent in the New York
City area. Use of &quot;designer drugs,&quot; some of which have
caused Parkinson's disease, have been blamed for over 100 deaths.
There is evidence of a link between intravenous drug use and the
contraction of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS). </p>

<p>Drug abuse affects much more than the individual drug user; it
also impacts on families, communities and entire governments. The
taint of drugs has reached into virtually every aspect of
American life, from public safety to the integrity of
professional sports. These problems and the full range of massive
government and private responses discussed in this report,
including increased education and enforcement efforts, expanded
intelligence and interdiction programs, and diversions of
military resources, costing billions of dollars, is the direct
result of a single cause: the destructive self-indulgence of
individual drug purchasers. Each time a drug user buys cocaine,
heroin, or other drugs, he makes a contribution to organized
crime. Such contributions are the sole sustenance of the
violence, corruption, illness and death that trafficking groups
bring to this and other societies. </p>

<h1>America's Habit </h1>

<h2>Drug Abuse, Drug Trafficking, &amp; Organized Crime </h2>

<p><b>President's Commission on Organized Crime, 1986 </b></p>

<hr>

<h2>Chapter III Part 1: Drug Trafficking and Organized Crime </h2>

<p>Introduction </p>

<p>Drug trafficking is the most widespread and lucrative
organized crime operation in the United States, accounting for
nearly 40 percent of this country's organized crime activity and
generating an annual income estimated to be as high as $110
billion. Large trafficking organizations dominate the illicit
drug market. These groups include the &quot;families&quot; of
America's La Cosa Nostra, as well as an array of more recently
identified crime groups such as the Sicilian &quot;Mafia,&quot;
outlaw motorcycle gangs and groups based in the Nigerian and
Colombian communities. While La Cosa Nostra has historically been
involved in narcotics trafficking, newer organizations, in many
ways quite different from La Cosa Nostra, now play a major role
in the drug trade. Generally, these newer groups develop solely
around drug trafficking operations and are activity-specific,
dependent only on drug-related criminal activity for income. They
tend to be more fluidly organized than La Cosa Nostra, and are
not as self-contained but are marked by a degree of violence and
corruption unsurpassed by any other criminal activity. </p>

<p>Organized crime groups involved in drug trafficking, however,
share a central feature with other organized crime groups in that
they consist of a core criminal group and a specialized criminal
support designed to facilitate illicit activity. This
&quot;core/support&quot; configuration is one this Commission has
found to be common to all organized crime groups today. </p>

<p>Cocaine Trafficking </p>

<p>America's cocaine supply at present originates exclusively in
South America. Coca is cultivated principally in Peru, Bolivia,
Colombia and Ecuador, and conversion laboratories have been
located in Colombia, Brazil and Venezuela. Other South American
and Caribbean countries serve as transshipment sites. All phases
of the cocaine trade, including cultivation, processing and
distribution have expanded since 1984, and the industry shows no
signs of diminishing despite the fact that cocaine supply already
exceeds consumer demand. </p>

<p>Control of the cocaine industry has traditionally been
maintained by a cartel of Colombian traffickers. Colombian groups
are the largest, wealthiest, most sophisticated organizations
trafficking in cocaine. A key to their domination of the market
has been their control of the processing laboratories used to
convert coca grown traditionally in Bolivia and Peru. Export of
the drug to the United States has also been handled almost
exclusively by Colombian trafficking organizations. While
Colombians currently control an estimated 75 percent of the
cocaine distributed to the United States, their domination has
been lessened recently both by the Colombian government's
imposition of severe restrictions on the importation of chemicals
essential to cocaine processing and by the destruction of cocaine
processing sites throughout Colombia by government authorities.
In 1984 three major Colombian conversion laboratories were
discovered and destroyed: at Tranquilandia, the largest facility,
ten metric tons of cocaine and 10,000 barrels of processing
chemicals were seized. In total, Colombian authorities
confiscated 16 metric tons of cocaine in 1984, a 600 percent
increase from the 2.5 metric tons seized in the previous year.
The pressures on cocaine traffickers were compounded in that year
by the Colombian government's decision to extradite drug
traffickers to the United States, and by the subsequent issuance
of warrants for the arrest of several major traffickers. </p>

<p>Intensified Colombian law enforcement measures have had
significant impact on trafficking operations. The initiatives
have prompted many traffickers to seek refuge in other South
American countries, and in some cases to relocate their
processing laboratories. These incidents have resulted in a
geographic dispersal of cocaine processing and export activities,
most notably to Bolivia and Peru. While it appeared initially
that activity in these countries was sponsored and overseen by
Colombian traffickers, increasing evidence suggests that groups
in both countries are becoming self-sufficient. Such
developments, however, remain an exception to the prevailing
Colombian dominance. </p>

<p>Despite the spread of cocaine activity through South America,
Colombian groups have left little room in the cocaine trade for
small-scale smugglers. While some independent operators and
smaller smuggling groups occasionally work independently of the
Colombian cartel, most are tied to the larger organization in at
least a contractor relationship. </p>

<p>The Colombian Connection: Origins </p>

<p>The Colombian involvement in U.S. cocaine trafficking can be
traced to the influx of Cuban citizens to South Florida after the
Castro Revolution in the early 1960's. Some of the Cuban-settled
communities became bases for the continuation of established
Cuban organized crime networks known as the &quot;Cuban
Mafia.&quot; The Cuban Mafia had been a major distributor of the
cocaine in Cuba, where the drug has long been accepted as a
social luxury, and thus had existing connections with South
American cocaine trafficking organizations. At first, the Florida
Cuban Mafia factions imported only enough cocaine to satisfy
members of their own community, but by the mid-1960's, they began
to import greater quantities of the drug in an effort to expand
distribution and increase profit. By 1965 Colombians supplied
nearly 100 percent of the cocaine moving through the Cuban
networks. Colombians refined the drug and Cubans trafficked and
distributed it in the United States. The system worked for a
time, but the Colombians increasingly desired control of the
entire operation. Through the late 1960's and early 1970's they
became more involved in cocaine production, and increased their
trafficking role. By 1978 Colombian traffickers had cut all ties
with the Cubans and assumed the dominant role they now play in
supplying cocaine to the American market. </p>

<p>Colombian groups have continued to control the U.S. cocaine
market through the 1980's for a number of reasons.
Geographically, Colombia is well-positioned both to receive coca
from Peru and Bolivia and to export the processed drug to the
United States either by air or by sea. In addition, the country's
vast central forests effectively conceal clandestine processing
laboratories and air strips, which facilitate the traffic.
Perhaps most importantly, the Colombians have a momentum by
benefit of their early involvement in the cocaine trade. They
have evolved from small, disassociated groups into
compartmentalized organizations and are sophisticated and
systematized in their approach to trafficking cocaine in the
United States. Further, groups in the Colombian population in the
U.S. provide traffickers access to this country and often serves
as a distribution network for Colombian cocaine. </p>

<p>The Colombian Organization </p>

<p>The major Colombian trafficking organizations are structured
to control each intermediate step required in processing and
exporting cocaine. Like traditional organized crime groups, they
are built of interdependent and essential component
&quot;divisions,&quot; each with a specialized area of
responsibility. Different members act as laborers, processors,
transporters, financiers and enforcers. In addition,
organizations generally supplement their regular membership with
criminal support of affiliates who perform services on a fee
basis. Few members of any organizational division are aware of
the others involved in the enterprise, and trafficking bosses are
well-insulated and protected by their organizations. </p>

<p>Organization laborers and processors prepare cocaine for U.S.
consumption. Most laborers in the cultivation phase are Peruvian
or Bolivian peasants who cultivate and harvest coca in remote
areas of the Eastern Andes, then process the coca leaves to base
in nearby villages. The growers are allied in small, independent
groups, but are typically financed, overseen, and protected by
members of a larger Colombian organization. </p>

<p>Processed coca base is usually flown on light aircraft from
the mountain villages to Colombian processing facilities by those
members of the Colombian organization responsible for
transportation. The planes land at clandestine airstrips, often
simple mud runways, located near the processing laboratories. The
laboratories vary widely in size, ranging from crude
small-quantity operations to large, sophisticated complexes, and
can be found both in Colombia's jungle and urban areas. </p>

<p>Coca base is typically processed to cocaine hydrochloride in
the laboratories, then bagged and taped into kilogram packages,
which are sometimes coded to indicate a particular United States
destination. The packages are loaded into duffle bags or burlap
sacks, then moved by the transportation group to a &quot;stash
house,&quot; a storage facility usually located near a seaport or
a clandestine airstrip. The cocaine is held at the stash house
until it is exported from Colombia. </p>

<p>Colombian trafficking organizations currently export an
estimated 62 percent of the cocaine they process on private
aircraft. The remaining 38 percent is shipped on ocean vessels or
smuggled on commercial air carriers. Most shipments are smuggled
out of Colombia from the country's northern coastal region, the
Guajira peninsula. Principal smuggling centers include the cities
of Santa Marta, Barranquilla, Cartagena, and Medellin. In
addition, a significant percentage of processed cocaine leaves
Colombia from airstrips located near larger processing facilities
in the jungles. </p>

<p>Typically, Colombian organizations oversee each cocaine
shipment from cultivation through wholesale transactions in the
United States. Retail and street-level sales are handled by a
variety of smaller groups and individuals in this country. </p>

<p>The money generated by the wholesale cocaine transaction is
maintained for the organization by financial experts familiar
with international banking, who are responsible for laundering,
banking and investing drug profits, and for assuring that a
portion of the drug profit is returned to Colombia for
reinvestment in the organization's cocaine enterprise. The
cartel's own financial experts are supported by a complement of
bankers, lawyers and other professionals in the United States,
who play a crucial role in facilitating these transactions. </p>

<p>Colombian trafficking organizations, like other organized
crime groups, rely on &quot;enforcement&quot; through violence
and intimidation to protect their inventory and profits.
&quot;Enforcement&quot; occurs both in Colombia and in the United
States and includes the collection of debts owed to the
organization and the elimination of interference from
competitors, informants and law enforcement officials. </p>

<p>Pilots: The American Affiliates </p>

<p>Cocaine is ordinarily smuggled from South America to the
United States for major trafficking organizations by American
citizens acting as mercenary pilots. Recruits include
ex-military, commercial and private pilots, and in some cases,
unlicensed aviators. The speed, mobility and evasive capabilities
of air transport have made it the preferred node of shipment
among Colombian traffickers, and many have built airstrips either
near their processing centers or along the coastlines to permit
the fast direct export of cocaine. On Colombia's north coast
alone, over 150 clandestine landing strips and three
international airports facilitate smuggling activities. </p>

<p>Individual pilots are generally responsible for purchasing or
leasing transportation vehicles and hiring flight crews.
Obtaining a plane for purchase seldom presents any difficulty,
since many aircraft are regularly advertised for sale in a number
of trade periodicals. One popular journal, Trade-a-Plane, is
published three times each month and advertises thousands of
aircraft available for sale in each issue. Planes are also
available for purchase at numerous government auctions of seized
properties. These events often allow traffickers to repurchase
aircraft, which they were previously forced to forfeit. </p>

<p>Because traffickers attempt to ship the largest possible
quantities of cocaine to the widest range of destinations in the
United States, the aircraft selected for smuggling generally
represent the optimum balance between range and cargo capacity.
The most popular of these are conventional light twin engine
planes, such as the Piper Aztec, Piper Navajo and the Cessna 400
series. Most such planes can transport about a ton of cocaine
over a range of about 1,800 miles and can stay airborne for 11
and one hours with standard fuel systems. Larger airplanes such
as DC-3 aircraft are common on shuttle flights between the United
States and various transshipment points; the fastest aircraft are
always preferred when available. </p>

<p>To maximize range and capability, smuggling planes are often
outfitted with auxiliary fuel systems. These auxiliary systems
may be attached to the outside body of the aircraft or the wing,
but must be inspected and approved by the Federal Aviation
Administration each time the outfitted aircraft prepares for
flight. A favored auxiliary system for cocaine traffickers is the
collapsible rubber fuel &quot;bladder,&quot; which may be placed
in the plane's fuselage, and simply folded up or thrown away
after the fuel contained within is used. The space occupied by
the bladder on the trip to Colombia can be utilized for cocaine
transport on the return journey. Bladders are, under all
circumstances, prohibited by Federal law. </p>

<p>Although the legitimate need for auxiliary fuel systems is
very limited, the systems are well-advertised and readily
available. One trafficker told the Commission he purchased
bladders and other long-range fuel systems regularly, always
paying the seller with &quot;suitcases full of cash.&quot; He
claims his cash was never questioned or refused. </p>

<p>Traffic From Colombia to the United States: The Hydra's Head </p>

<p>Smugglers use a vast number of both air and sea trafficking
routes to transport cocaine from South America to the United
States. The most commonly travelled routes are through the
Windward Passage between Cuba and Haiti, through the Yucatan
Channel between Mexico and Cuba, and through the Mona Passage,
bordered by the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico. </p>

<p>Traditionally, 90 percent of the cocaine shipped by these
routes has entered the United States at points along the Florida
coast; traffickers now, however, more frequently deliver
shipments to all the States along the Gulf Coast and elsewhere
throughout this country. Cocaine traffic also now runs directly
from Colombia's west coast to California and other western
states. These shifts are perceived as a response by traffickers
to increased law enforcement pressure in South Florida,
specifically to the intensified efforts of the South
Florida/Caribbean Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force.
The theme is a common one: as law enforcement closes off one
point of entry to drug traffickers, traffickers develop many new
points of entry as replacements. </p>

<p>Air Shipment </p>

<p>Nearly two-thirds of the cocaine exported from South America
to the United State is transported by general aviation aircraft.
Planes of all sizes, ranging from small turbo-prop craft to large
C-123 cargo transport planes, are used for drug shipment. Small
aircraft, which cannot carry adequate fuel to allow direct flight
from Colombia to the United States, must refuel at transshipment
points between the two countries. These contact points are
indispensable, and are located throughout Central America, the
Dominican Republic, Cuba, the Bahamas and Puerto Rico.
Transshipment points may be simply refueling stations, or may be
bases or stations equipped to allow cocaine off-loading and
repackaging. From the transshipment points, cocaine is generally
ferried to the United States by small planes or boats. </p>

<p>Mexico has gained popularity as a transshipment point since
1980. Although coca cultivation has not been observed in Mexico,
an estimated 10 to 20 percent of the cocaine exported to the
United States currently transits that country. Three Mexican
transshipment patterns are typical. First, Mexican traffickers
obtain cocaine in South America, transport it to Mexico, then
traffic the drug overland into the United States. Second,
Colombian or American couriers travel by commercial aircraft from
South America to Mexico, then cross the border into this country.
Finally, Colombian or North American traffickers use Mexico's
numerous clandestine airstrips, especially in Yucatan, for
refueling and for loading purposes; the smuggling plane in use
may continue directly into the United States, or the shipment may
be broken into smaller loads, then trafficked overland by Mexican
organizations. The majority of cocaine shipped through Mexico is
transported to the United States by car, truck or bus, but a
significant amount is smuggled aboard small aircraft. The Mexican
groups, formerly limited primarily to trafficking heroin and
marijuana, have eagerly expanded their role as middlemen between
Colombian traffickers and American consumers. </p>

<p>Maritime Shipment </p>

<p>An estimated 18 percent (15 tons in 1984) of the cocaine
trafficked into the United States is exported from South America
by sea vessel. All types of ships are used for smuggling, from
small high-speed cigarette boats to large commercial cargo
carriers. Colombians dominate maritime cocaine smuggling, and
most shipments depart that country's north coastline, which
features three major seaports and countless debarkation ports for
smaller craft. Approximately one-half of the cocaine exported by
sea is concealed in commercial vessels, and a smaller percentage
is shipped in private boats which are frequently outfitted with
special compartments designed for drug storage. Small amounts of
cocaine are also often shipped on with marijuana on
non-commercial smuggling vessels. </p>

<p>Maritime trafficking routes have shifted significantly in the
past five years, primarily in response to increased law
enforcement surveillance. While a major portion of the maritime
traffic formerly flowed directly into South Florida, traffickers
now increasingly use the longer eastern routes through the
Caribbean to the Mid-Atlantic and New England coasts, as well as
direct routes to the U.S. west coast. These routes make smuggling
more expensive for traffickers, since they require larger
vessels, larger crews and more sophisticated electronic
equipment. </p>

<p>Case Study: Devoe Airlines </p>

<p>Devoe Airlines was a scheduled commuter air service operating
between Miami and smaller Florida cities during the early 1980's.
Owned by Miami pilot Jack Devoe, the business was essentially a
front for a Colombian drug trafficking operation, which included
regular large quantity marijuana and cocaine smuggling. In total,
8 to 10 contract pilots employed by Devoe were involved in over
100 trafficking flights over a five year period and carried
roughly 7,000 pounds of cocaine from South America to the United
States. Jack Devoe estimates that his flying organization grossed
millions of dollars each month during peak smuggling periods. </p>

<p>Devoe's trafficking pilots initially travelled non-stop routes
between the United States and Colombia, but developed a
transshipment point on Little Derby Island in the Bahamas for
purposes of &quot;security . . . [and] police protection&quot; in
the 1980's. Devoe hired six to eight employees to work as needed
at the island base to unload and repackage drug shipments. There
was no interference from Bahamian law enforcement at the Little
Darby base &quot;as long as the payments [to officials] were on
time.&quot; </p>

<p>Typically operating mid-size turbo-prop aircraft, Devoe pilots
departed for Colombia either from the base at Little Derby Island
or from Florida airports. Their route took them through the
Windward Passage generally to Colombian locations about 60 miles
south of the equator. In the early stages of the operation,
landings were made at official Colombian airports including the
airfields at Santa Marta and Riohacha. In at least one instance,
cocaine was openly loaded onto the smuggling aircraft at Riohacha
airport. In the early 1980's Devoe shifted landings to
clandestine jungle airstrips maintained by the organization's
cocaine supplier, Pepe Cabrera. This system streamlined the
trafficking process by eliminating transport of the cocaine to an
airport. The cocaine shipment was loaded directly onto the
aircraft near the strip, where the plane was simultaneously
prepared for the return flight. </p>

<p>Generally, Devoe pilots returned to the United States within
one day. Their preferred return route extended along the
Colombia/Venezuela border, over Haiti, and to the Bahamian base
on Little Derby Island. There, cocaine was sealed into the wing
fuel tanks of a small aircraft and flown directly into South
Florida for delivery to the cartel's representative there. </p>

<p>The Devoe organization's methods for avoiding interdiction
between South America and the United States were relatively
simple and typical of such smuggling operations. A Devoe pilot
learned the frequencies of DEA surveillance aircraft on one
occasion by &quot;acting like a helicopter buff&quot; inspecting
a DEA Cobra pursuit helicopter parked near the Devoe hangar.
Inside the helicopter the pilot copied the frequencies from a
clipboard hanging on the instrument panel. As the pilot explained
to the Commission: </p>

<p>By [subsequently] using our scanner and our knowledge of the
frequencies in use, we could monitor the activities of DEA planes
. . . we could learn not only the activities of the planes, but
also go up and check the plane out. By learning what types of
aircraft DEA was using we could plan our own strategy more
effectively . . . </p>

<p>Devoe also regularly sent &quot;cover-flight&quot; aircraft
ahead of the smuggling planes along the trafficking route to
monitor DEA and Customs Service surveillance patrols by radio.
These planes, which carried no drug cargo, were also used to
decoy pursuit aircraft. Once in the United States, Devoe strategy
for clearing Customs inspection was to: </p>

<p>&quot;. . . act normally and file a flight plan, come in and
land, and let them inspect the airplane . . . Customs inspectors
were far less interested in a lengthy examination of my plane if
I came in on a Sunday afternoon in the middle of the televised
football game. If the Dolphins were playing, that was even
better.&quot; </p>

<p>Using these tactics, Devoe Airlines was able to complete over
100 trafficking flights from Colombia without interference from
law enforcement authorities. </p>

<p>Case Study: Barry Seal </p>

<p>Adler Berriman Seal, a former TWA 747 captain, flew cocaine
from Colombia to the United States for over seven years during
the late 1970's and early 1980's. Seal was recruited as a
trafficking pilot by a personal friend who worked for the
Colombian cocaine trafficking organization headed by Jorge Ochoa,
and eventually worked directly with that organization's
leadership. </p>

<p>Initially, Seal flew direct trafficking flights between
Louisiana, and Colombia. He piloted a number of different
smuggling aircraft, the largest of which was a Vietnam-vintage
C-123 capable of holding tons of packaged cocaine. Seal always
departed and returned to his Louisiana base at night to reduce
chances of interdiction. His typical route took him over the
Yucatan Peninsula (not over the more heavily patrolled Yucatan
channel) and directly over Central America to the eastern tip of
Honduras, then south to any one of a number of airstrips and
airports in north central Colombia. </p>

<p>According to Seal, the Ochoa organization paid Colombian
officials bribes of $10,000 to $25,000, per flight for a
&quot;window,&quot; i.e., a specific time, position and altitude
designated for the smuggling flight's penetration of the
Colombian air space. If this payment was not made, the aircraft
was susceptible to interception by Colombian authorities. Seal
generally arrived in Colombia at dawn. His aircraft was loaded
with cocaine and refueled within an hour, sometimes within
fifteen minutes; and he returned immediately to the United
States. </p>

<p>Seal used two fairly simple techniques to avoid interdiction
on his return trip to the United States: both were effective
because of the heavy helicopter traffic running between the Gulf
Coast States and the hundreds of oil rigs located off shore.
First, when he reached the middle of the Gulf on his return trip,
Seal slowed his aircraft to 110-120 knots and was thus perceived
by monitoring radar as a helicopter, not a plane. Secondly, at a
distance of about 50 miles off the United States coast, he
dropped the aircraft to an altitude of 500-1000 feet in order to
co-mingle with the helicopter traffic, and thereby arouse even
less suspicion. </p>

<p>Once in United States airspace, Seal proceeded to prearranged
points 40 to 50 miles inland. The points were mapped out in
advance with Loran C, a long-range navigational instrument.
Further inland, he was generally joined by a helicopter. The two
aircraft proceeded to a drop zone, where the helicopter hovered
close to the ground. Seal then dropped the load of cocaine from
the airplane on a parachute; the helicopter picked up the load
from the drop zone and delivered it to waiting automobiles, which
eventually moved the cocaine to Miami. Seal proceeded to land his
drug-free aircraft at any nearby airport. </p>

<p>Seal was well paid for his services. He claims his top fee for
smuggling a kilogram of cocaine was $5,000; an average load was
300 kilograms. His most profitable single load netted him $1.5
million. He was never apprehended in connection with this
operation. </p>

<p>Specialized Electronics: The Smuggler's Edge </p>

<p>Like many trafficking pilots today, both Seal and Devoe relied
on sophisticated electronic equipment to maintain and secure
communications within their organization and to monitor law
enforcement surveillance efforts. Most devices used, while
expensive, are readily available in the United States, and
trafficking organizations, of course, fund the purchase of any
equipment that will facilitate their operations. Seal, for
example, once spent over $200,000 cash on communication and
surveillance equipment for the Ochoa cocaine trafficking
organization here in the United States in a two-day period.
Payments for this type of equipment are almost always made in
cash - sometimes suitcases full of cash - and are rarely refused.
</p>

<p>The communication devices most commonly used by traffickers
include state of the art radio equipment, communication
scramblers, pocket pagers and encrypting devices. The equipment
is used to prevent law enforcement interception of communication
between traffickers. A scrambler, for example, attaches to an
ordinary radio, and &quot;scrambles&quot; the normal radio
frequency with a number of different codes. Only someone with a
receiver coded to the particular scrambler frequency can decipher
the transmitted message; the transmission is unintelligible to
all other receivers. Digital encryption devices are used to send
messages in code, and are often secured so that they can be
accessed only after a security number is punched directly into
the device. The security feature allows only members of the
trafficking organization, who know the access code, to send or
decipher coded messages. The speed with which a digital message
is transmitted precludes radio tracking, at least by traditional
triangulation. </p>

<p>Among the other specialized devices used by traffickers to
detect and avoid law enforcement surveillance are radar
altimeters, beacon-interrogating digital radar, position tracking
equipment and long-range navigation instruments. Latest
generation night vision goggles are also frequently used by
traffickers flying at low altitudes in darkness. The strap-on
goggles intensify any available light by a factor of 50,000 and
greatly reduce a smuggler's risk of interdiction by allowing him
to fly his aircraft without lights. </p>

<p>The Combined Effort </p>

<p>A number of independent Colombian trafficking organizations,
among them the largest and most powerful operations, work in
collaboration on individual smuggling ventures. As described by
DEA special agent Michael Fredericks, the resulting organization
is fluid: </p>

<p>There is a level of organization that may involve . . . a
handful of people at the top. . . Below that level . . . there
are many workers who move between one organization and another. .
. It seems that in the Colombian organizations, a laboratory
operator may work for 1 [specific] trafficker . . . and not even
be aware of it simple because of the levels of insulation. </p>

<p>At the time of the preparation of this report, three men,
Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria, Jorge Luis Ochoa Vasques, and
Carlos Enrique Lehder-Rivas, were reported to control the most
significant trafficking organizations in Colombia. Known as
&quot;Los Grandes Mafiosos&quot; in the Colombian press, each
directs a separate organization, but the organizations work in
concert and exchange personnel and equipment in various instances
to maximize efficiency and profit. The resulting cartel system
affords these traffickers numerous advantages, among them control
over the price and the quality of Colombian cocaine, greater
access to smuggling and processing equipment, and a wide variety
of methods by which to avoid law enforcement. </p>

<p>A chart detailing a temporary cooperative venture based in
Medellin, Colombia, between the Pablo Escobar organization and
the Jorge Ochoa organization was confiscated from a mid-level
trafficker involved in the operation, and was provided to the
Commission by the Drug Enforcement Administration (Figure 2). As
diagrammed, the Escobar and Ochoa organizations combined and
divided the trafficking responsibilities typically completed by a
single organization. The same component parts - labor,
processing, transportation, finance and enforcement - were
carried over from the individual organizations, with the Escobar
group taking responsibility for production activities, and the
Ochoa group handling enforcement and finances. </p>

<p>Colombia Cracks Down </p>

<p>Through the 1970's cocaine traffickers operated throughout
Colombia with little interference, and in fact with considerable
support from the Colombian government. The situation changed in
April 1984 when drug traffickers assassinated Colombia's Minister
of Justice, Rodrigo Lara Bonilla. Lara's assassination came two
months after he authorized a raid on a major cocaine processing
plant known as Tranquilandia in Southeastern Colombia's Llanos
region, which resulted in the destruction of over $1 billion
worth of cocaine. Following Lara's assassination, Colombian
President Belisario Betancur Cuartas declared a &quot;war without
quarter&quot; on all drug smugglers and signed extradition orders
for a number of known major traffickers. President Betancur also
shifted trafficking trials to Colombia's military courts,
increased eradication and interdiction efforts within his
country, and increased regulation of those chemicals necessary
for processing coca base into cocaine. </p>

<p>President Betancur's actions have had important ramifications
both for traffickers and for other South and Central American
governments. When the intensified Colombian programs became
effective, a number of major traffickers, among them Escobar,
Lehder and Ochoa, went into hiding and moved their processing
operations to neighboring countries. In 1984 processing
laboratories as well as stockpiles of essential conversion
chemicals were discovered and destroyed in Panama, Venezuela,
Mexico and Canada. Evidence suggests that significant processing
activity is now also taking place in Nicaragua and Brazil. The
Colombian regulation of ether and other essential precursor
chemicals has resulted in an increase in cocaine processing
activity in the United States: 21 processing laboratories were
discovered and destroyed in South Florida in 1984 as opposed to
11 in 1983. </p>

<p>In March 1985 despite his status as a fugitive, Carlos Lehder
appeared on Colombian television, filmed live from a jungle
clearing by a Spanish film crew. Lehder used the television
opportunity, which he had arranged, to appeal to the Colombian
revolutionary organizations to participate in the &quot;cocaine
bonanza . . . the arm of the struggle against America.&quot; He
also characterized cocaine as the &quot;Achilles heel of American
imperialism.&quot; Lehder disappeared into the jungle after the
interview and remains at large, presumably in the remote jungles
of Colombia. </p>

<p>Heroin Trafficking </p>

<p>Traditional Organized Crime: La Cosa Nostra and the French
Connection </p>

<p>Heroin trafficking in this country first became big business
in the 1920's, when organized criminals based in New York City's
Jewish community began to control the importation and
distribution of the drug. By the late 1930's, La Cosa Nostra
joined the Jewish groups in the heroin enterprise, importing the
drug from France, Asia and the Mideast. When these sources became
inaccessible during World War II, Mexico became the major U.S.
heroin supplier. </p>

<p>After the war, La Cosa Nostra took control of America's heroin
market, this time importing most of its drug supply from Italian
refineries. When the Italian government banned the manufacture of
heroin in the early 1950's, La Cosa Nostra traffickers were
forced to look to other sources. A new system was quickly
devised, by which Turkish morphine base was refined to heroin in
Marseilles, then shipped to Montreal or Sicily. Organized crime
groups located in these transshipment points then sent the heroin
directly to the United States. This arrangement, popularly known
as the &quot;French Connection,&quot; allowed La Cosa Nostra to
monopolize the heroin trade from the 1980's through the early
1970's. During the peak French Connection years, the LCN
controlled an estimated 95 percent of all of the heroin entering
New York City, as well as most of the heroin distributed
throughout the United States. </p>

<p>The La Cosa Nostra heroin monopoly lasted until 1972, when
under diplomatic pressure from the United States, Turkey banned
opium production and the French Connection collapsed. Amsterdam
replaced Marseilles as the center of European heroin traffic, and
Chicago, Los Angeles and Miami joined New York City as major U.S.
distribution centers. Other trafficking groups rose to compete
with the LCN for heroin dollars in New York City and throughout
the country. </p>

<p>Source Country Traffickers: Mexico </p>

<p>In the five years after the collapse of the French Connection,
Mexico became the major source of U.S. heroin. Mexico's rise was
logical: the country contains extensive regions suitable for both
opium cultivation and refining and shares a lightly guarded 2,000
mile border with the United States. Mexicans could manufacture
heroin and smuggle it into the United States with little risk of
detection. This simplified trafficking system resulted in
increased Mexican heroin availability in the United States. </p>

<p>For generations, opium has been grown in remote areas of
Mexico's Sierra Madre Mountain states of Durango, Sinaloa and
Chihuahua. Culiacan, on the western side of the Sierra Madre, and
Durango to the east, developed in the 1970's as major production
centers for heroin destined for U.S. distribution. Trafficking
organizations are now entrenched in these areas, and are involved
in all phases of the heroin manufacture and distribution process.
Opium gum is collected by peasants in isolated mountain areas and
is transported by mule or carried by hand to nearby mountain
villages. Typically, village middlemen sell the opium to a drug
trafficking organization boss, who moves drugs to an
organization-held laboratory for processing to heroin. Mexican
couriers then transport the heroin to the members of the
trafficking organization in the United States. The major Mexican
heroin trafficking organizations supplying heroin to America are
generally extended familial organizations, but loyal workers
sometimes are given status as &quot;quasi-family&quot; members of
the groups. The organizations work to eliminate competition and
to control as completely as possible all aspects of the heroin
trade. Members act as opium cultivators, village middlemen, and
heroin brokers and distributors. In the United States, the
organization typically controls distribution from the wholesaler
to the retail distributor, but has little or no involvement in
street distribution. This is seen as an unnecessarily risky and
low-profit aspect of the business, and is left to outsiders. </p>

<p>Violence is an integral part of Mexican trafficking.
Organization members provide cultivators with semi-automatic and
automatic weapons to protect their crops; weapons are used
throughout the trafficking system to eliminate informants, and to
intimidate competitors and law enforcement officials. Corruption
of Mexican police officials is well-documented and is essential
to the smooth operation of the Mexican trafficking organizations.
</p>

<p>In 1984, Mexican traffickers provided 32 percent share of the
heroin consumed in the United States. The figure is expected to
rise over the next several years due to the continued devaluation
of the peso and improved agricultural technology. </p>

<p>Case Study: The Herrera Family </p>

<p>Since the early 1970's the Jamie Herrera-Navarres organization
has been a major heroin smuggling power operative between Mexico
and the United States. The Herrera organization is a
confederation of families related by blood and marriage, although
some non-family members have been accepted into the group over
time. Older family members process opium and morphine base,
younger members handle the drug sales and shipments in Mexico and
in the United States. The Herrera organization is now estimated
to have 3,000 to 5,000 members, a significant portion of whom are
naturalized American citizens and illegal aliens residing in this
country. </p>

<p>Despite the 1978 conviction and incarceration of Jamie
Herrera, and several key family members, the organization remains
active. In July 1985, 135 persons in the United States,
comprising eight separate Herrera-related distribution rings,
were indicted in Chicago on drug trafficking charges. These
Herrera groups allegedly trafficked heroin and marijuana from
Mexico through El Paso to a middleman in Texas. From Texas, the
drugs were shipped to Chicago, then distributed throughout the
country. This Herrera enterprise, only a small fragment of the
total organization, is estimated to have had gross annual profits
of over $200 million. The arrests are expected to have a
significant effect on the Herrera organization, if only on a
temporary basis. </p>

<p>Source Country Traffickers: Southeast Asia </p>

<p>Mexican heroin production decreased in the late 1970's due to
enforcement, eradication and poor weather conditions. By 1980,
Mexico provided only 25 percent of the heroin consumed in the
United Stated, down from a peak level of 80 percent in 1975. At
the same time, heroin production in Southeast Asia accelerated
dramatically. By 1976, the &quot;Golden Triangle&quot; of Burma,
Thailand and Laos supplied more than a third of the heroin
consumed in the United States; Mexico supplied the remainder.
Golden Triangle heroin first gained popularity with American
servicemen stationed in Southeast Asia during the Vietnam War
because it was readily available, inexpensive, and considerably
more pure than Mexican heroin. After the war, Golden Triangle
heroin was exported to the United States in increasing amounts. </p>

<p>Nearly 90 percent of the Golden Triangle opium is currently
produced in Burma. Two-thirds of this crop is produced in the
northeast area of the country, where control is shared by the
Burmese Communist Party (BCP) and the Shan United Army (SUA).
Both groups were at one time political insurgent organizations
but are now almost entirely devoted to obtaining profit for the
production, smuggling and sale of heroin base. They derive
considerable income from &quot;taxes&quot; and fees they levy on
opium growers and heroin producers and traffickers. This income
is used to purchase weapons, to be utilized not in furtherance of
political goals, but for protection of each group's narcotics
enterprise. Traditionally, the two groups have coexisted
peacefully: the BCP has acted as the major opium supplier in
Southeast Asia and the SUA has been the area's major refiner and
trafficker. The BCP has recently become involved in refining and
distribution activities, and the organizations are currently in
conflict. </p>

<p>Opium and morphine base produced in northeastern Burma
transported by horse and donkey caravans to refineries along the
Thailand-Burma border for conversion to heroin and heroin base.
Most of the finished products are shipped across the border into
various towns in North Thailand and down to Bangkok for further
distribution to international markets. In the past major ethnic
Chinese traffickers in Bangkok have controlled much of the
foreign sales and movement of Southeast Asian heroin from
Thailand, but a combination of law enforcement pressure,
publicity and a regional drought has significantly reduced their
role. As a consequence, many less-predominant traffickers in
Bangkok and other parts of Thailand now control smaller
quantities of the heroin going to international markets. </p>

<p>Although Thailand is the primary transit center for Southeast
Asian heroin destined for international markets, alternate
trafficking routes are increasingly utilized as a result of
Thailand's sustained enforcement actions. Some opium, morphine
base, and heroin base are moved South through Burma to southern
Thailand and Malaysia for conversion to heroin in laboratories
along the Thailand/Malaysia border. Refined heroin is also
trafficked from Burma to India, then to the West. </p>

<p>Heroin from Southeast Asia is most frequently brought to the
United States by couriers, typically Thai and U.S. nationals and
Hong Kong Chinese, traveling on commercial airlines. California
and Hawaii are the primary U.S. entry points for Golden Triangle
heroin, but small percentages of the drug are trafficked into New
York City and Washington D.C. While Southeast Asian groups have
had success in trafficking heroin to the United States, they
initially had difficulty arranging street level distribution.
However, with the incarceration of Asian traffickers in American
prisons during the 1970's, contacts between Asian and American
prisoners developed. These contacts have allowed Southeast Asian
traffickers access to individuals and organizations distributing
heroin at the retail level. </p>

<p>Chinese organized crime groups, known as Triads, located
primarily in Hong Kong, and their U.S. counterparts, Tongs, are
positioned to participate in Southeast Asian heroin traffic, but
the extent of their activity in these enterprises is not known at
the present time. These organizations provide Asians direct
access to criminal groups in the United States, and could
potentially assume a significant role in U.S. heroin trafficking
activities. Currently, there are major Triad organizations in New
York, Los Angeles, Seattle, San Francisco, and Toronto. </p>

<p>Source Country Traffickers: Southwest Asia </p>

<p>Opium production in Southeast Asia was significantly reduced
in the late 1970's and early 1980's due to a prolonged drought.
This decrease, along with the unstable political climate in the
region caused by the fall of the ruling governments in South
Vietnam and Laos, resulted in a reduction of Southeast Asian
heroin exports to the United States. During this period, opium
production in the Golden Crescent area of Southwest Asia,
comprising the common border regions of Pakistan, Afghanistan and
Iran, markedly increased. In 1979 the Golden Crescent became the
primary U.S. heroin source. Southwest Asia continues to be this
country's major supplier: over one-half of the heroin entering
the United States in 1984 originated as opium in the Golden
Crescent. </p>

<p>The surge in Golden Crescent heroin exports to the United
States can be attributed to a number of factors. Opium has always
been grown in the region, but traditionally, opium grown in
Afghanistan and Pakistan was shipped directly to Iran to supply
that country's one million opium addicts. The situation changed
dramatically after the 1980 fundamentalist revolution in Iran, as
political and social instability allowed greatly increased
domestic opium production and curtailed the demand for opium from
Pakistan and Afghanistan. The Iranian market was further closed
to outsiders by the 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, which
blocked several of the traditional smuggling routes into Iran. </p>

<p>Concurrent with the reduction in Iranian demand for
non-domestic opium, growers in Afghanistan and Pakistan harvested
record crops. The opium crop in Pakistan alone increased by 400
percent between 1974-1979, from 200 to 800 metric tons.
Consequently Pakistani and Afghan traffickers learned to refine
their opium into heroin, and sought new markets for their
product, mainly in Western Europe and the and the United States. </p>

<p>Southwest Asian opium is grown in remote mountain areas and
generally is transported to crude laboratories in the
Pakistan/Afghanistan border areas. Most of the refineries are
located in Pakistan's Northwest Frontier Province or
Afghanistan's Nangarhai Province; many are clustered in the area
of the Khyber Pass. Refined heroin leaves Pakistan via several
routes: through Baluchistan to Iran and beyond; by sea through
Karachi to Bombay and on to the Arabian Gulf States or Europe;
overland through the Lahore area enroute to transit points in
India; or by air through Islamabad or Karachi. </p>

<p>Southwest Asian heroin is typically smuggled into the United
States concealed in legitimate shipments of air and sea cargo,
such as textiles or sports equipment manufactured by Pakistani
companies, or it is carried by air couriers. Couriers generally
travel on commercial carriers, and many have connections with
airline crews and station managers. The international postal
system is also commonly used to ship heroin from Pakistan
directly to the United States in sealed newspapers and
periodicals. </p>

<p>Golden Crescent heroin is trafficked into the United States by
a variety of narcotics organizations. The following is an
overview of some of the more significant groups involved in the
Southwest Asian heroin trade. </p>

<p>Pakistani Traffickers </p>

<p>Pakistani nationals are responsible for trafficking a
significant percentage of Golden Crescent heroin in the United
States, especially in the Northeast. The Pakistanis do not have a
sophisticated retail sales network in the United States and
typically rely on family or Pakistani friends in this country to
distribute drugs. They also have relied on black trafficking
organizations in Los Angeles, Detroit and New York, and with
Italian organized crime in New York City. One Pakistani
distribution system was described in testimony before this
Commission by a Pakistani national who was incarcerated for his
involvement in a distribution network. The Commission witness has
relatives living both in Lahore, Pakistan, and in the United
States; he was a resident of Houston, Texas and was employed as
an engineer while involved in heroin trafficking. In the heroin
operation, a family member in Lahore sent couriers to JFK airport
in New York with heroin concealed in false-bottom luggage. From
JFK, the couriers traveled &quot;in transit&quot; to La Guardia,
then on to Toronto. Because of their &quot;in transit&quot;
status, Customs Service officials did not search the travelers in
the United States, and Canadian Customs inspection was not
difficult to clear. </p>

<p>In Canada, traffickers often held a particular heroin shipment
for three to six months, until appropriate distribution contacts
were established and it was certain that law enforcement
officials were not aware of the shipment. At that time,
distribution contacts traveled by automobile to Toronto, picked
up a portion or all of the heroin shipment, and drove the heroin
into the United States without Customs interdiction. This
particular network supplied heroin to Seattle, Houston, San
Francisco, New York and Las Vegas. The contacts were all related
by blood or marriage. </p>

<p>Pakistanis also rely on the international postal system to
move drugs from Southwest Asia to the United States. In July
1983, for example, U.S. Customs officials at JFK Airport seized
one kilogram of heroin concealed in rolled newspapers destined
for Pakistani nationals residing in New York. The package had
been sent from the United Arab Emirates. Two other packages, each
containing one-half kilogram of heroin, were mailed to Berkeley,
California from the same source. Rolled newspapers and magazines
can conceal up to one kilogram of heroin and are generally sealed
in plastic. Drugs are also sent through the mail concealed in
shipments of textiles, clothing and other durable goods. </p>

<p>Lebanese Traffickers </p>

<p>A portion of Golden Crescent heroin passes through Lebanon en
route to the United States, thus affording Lebanese nationals an
opportunity to become involved in the trafficking activity. A
significant percentage of the heroin exported from Lebanon leaves
via Damascus International Airport. </p>

<p>In the United States, trafficking by Lebanese nationals is
especially prevalent in the Northeast. In one network,
non-Lebanese couriers primarily from Canada traveled to Damascus
and Beirut to pick up heroin which they then transported to
Houston, Detroit and New York via commercial carrier. Heroin was
concealed in false-bottom luggage and inside photo albums. The
heroin was transferred to Lebanese nationals living in Toronto
and Ontario, Canada, and in various cities in the United States.
Some of the money generated from the sale of this heroin was
laundered in banks in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. </p>

<p>India </p>

<p>A proportion of the heroin traditionally distributed abroad
through the Pakistan cities of Karachi, Peshawar and Quetta is
now being shipped through Bombay and New Dehli. Traffickers
smuggle Southwest Asian heroin into India along the Indo-Pakistan
border and transport it overland to the Indian cities; Southeast
Asian heroin is brought into Bombay and Calcutta by sea and
overland routes. Bombay, Calcutta and New Dehli are now major
staging, shipping and trafficking centers for heroin smuggled to
the West. Trafficking activity is frequent at Perlane Airport in
Dehli and at Bombay's Sahar International Airport, and Indian
harbors and airports are used by Pakistani, Afghan and Indian
traffickers as points of embarkation to Western destinations. </p>

<p>West Africa. </p>

<p>In the past three years, West African countries, especially
Nigeria, have been documented as transshipments centers for
Golden Crescent heroin. Nigerian couriers based in Lagos travel
to Pakistan to obtain heroin, then continue on commercial flights
to their final destinations, or return to Nigeria to repackage
the narcotics into smaller amounts for smuggling to the West. </p>

<p>A number of loosely associated Nigerian heroin trafficking
organizations have connections both with suppliers in Pakistan
and with retailers in Western Europe and the United States.
Typically, Nigerian couriers travel directly to Karachi on
commercial aircraft and purchase heroin in that city, but some
couriers continue to Peshawar to make their purchases. Couriers
return to Nigeria transiting other countries in Africa and
Europe. A different group of couriers, usually students or poor
residents of Lagos, traffic the drugs to Europe or the United
States. </p>

<p>Couriers typically enter the United States directly through
JFK airport in New York although in some cases, they come to this
country via cities in Europe and Canada. Drugs are concealed in
body cavities, and in false-bottom suitcases. </p>

<p>After the heroin arrives in the United States, it is sold only
to one or two American distributors in a given area. Distribution
networks are most active in New York City and Washington, D.C.
and are operative in Los Angeles, Houston and Boston. DEA reports
that individuals in nearly every community of Nigerian nationals
in the United States has some link to heroin traffickers and
couriers. Profits from heroin sales are laundered through banks
in the United States in Britain. </p>

<p>The Post-French Connection LCN </p>

<p>Traditional organized crime continues to play a significant
role in this country's heroin trade through the 1980's. The LCN's
long established connections with criminal organizations in
Sicily facilitate the movement of heroin from Europe to the
United States, and while Sicily is no longer a major refinery for
heroin, the country is a major transshipment center for Southwest
and Southeast Asian heroin. Sicilian organizations supply LCN
affiliates with heroin; LCN networks either distribute the drug
themselves or sell it in large quantities to major distributors. </p>

<p>The LCN As A Supplier: The Nicky Barnes Operation </p>

<p>Black criminal groups have controlled some percentage of
heroin traffic in New York City since the 1940's. Their influence
increased significantly in the early 1970's, after the French
Connection. The first major independent black trafficking
organization, a group of over one hundred distributors and
couriers, was headed by Charles Green. The Green organization
imported heroin and cocaine from South America and distributed
the drugs throughout New York City during the late 1960's. Green
was arrested in 1970, control of this heroin network passed to
Frank Matthews. Matthews was brought in to the heroin business by
Louis Cirillo, a major LCN associate, and was continually
supplied with LCN heroin. </p>

<p>Leroy &quot;Nicky&quot; Barnes succeeded Matthews in 1971.
Under his leadership, the organization controlled heroin sales
and manufacture throughout New York State into Canada and
Pennsylvania. The Barnes operation was well-organized and
lucrative. By 1976, Barnes had at least seven major lieutenants
under his direction; each of them controlled a dozen mid-level
distributors, who in turn supplied up to forty street-level
retailers. Barnes at all times remained well insulated from the
daily trafficking activities, and maintained a wealthy lifestyle.
He owned five homes, a Mercedes, a Maserati, several Lincolns,
Cadillacs and Thunderbirds, and hundreds of suits and coats. He
estimates that his total trafficking income was at least several
million dollars. </p>

<p>Barnes joined with six other major New York dealers to form a
heroin cartel called the &quot;Council&quot; in the mid 1970's.
Members of the Council pooled funds to purchase multi-kilo
amounts of heroin, worked to ensure a consistent supply of the
drug in their distribution area, combined their
&quot;cutting&quot; and distribution networks in certain cases,
and often used a common sources for diluents, weapons,
automobiles and other resources. The Council had specific
&quot;departments&quot; which arranged legal services, security
and enforcement, and financial services including money
laundering. </p>

<p>Barnes' most significant source of heroin, to whom he directed
other Council members, was LCN associate &quot;Natty&quot;
Madonna. Despite Barnes' assertion and belief that the Council
worked completely independently of the Mafia, through the Madonna
connection, LCN heroin was prevalent in Harlem traffic from 1972
to 1976. </p>

<p>The Asian-LCN Links </p>

<p>La Cosa Nostra actively seeks out Asian nationals as
connections to heroin sources in Southeast Asia. In testimony
before the President's Commission on organized crime, Franklin
Liu, a veteran Hong Kong clothier, explained how he was recruited
as a courier for a New York La Cosa Nostra family involved in
heroin trafficking. Liu, who held a legitimate four year business
visa which allowed him to travel without restriction, was first
contacted by Antonio Turano, a reputed member of the Sicilian
Mafia, in connection with Turano's money laundering operations.
In one instance, Turano brought Liu a suitcase filled with
$400,000 cash, and requested that Liu wire the money to a bank in
Zurich. Turano met with Liu in Milan in the course of the
operation to make certain that the money had been wired without
incident. </p>

<p>At a later date, after Liu had successfully participated in a
number of money laundering operations, Turano asked Liu if he had
any connections to drug traffickers in the Far East; Liu did not.
Turano arranged a connection, and agreed to pay Liu $5,000 for
every kilo of heroin he trafficked into the United States. Liu
was subsequently contacted by Turano's agent, a Thai woman, and
arranged to meet her at a hotel in New York City. When they met,
each held half of a one dollar bill given to them by Turano as
identification. Liu gave the woman his car keys; the next day she
returned the car with heroin in the trunk and requested a payment
of $40,000 in cash and a $60,000 bank check. When Liu went to
collect the money from Turano, he found that Turano had been
arrested. Liu was subsequently arrested and convicted on charges
of conspiracy to import heroin in connection with this case. </p>

<p>The Pizza Connection </p>

<p>During the late 1970's and early 1980's members of La Cosa
Nostra in the United States allegedly cooperated with the
Sicilian Mafia in a drug trafficking conspiracy which resulted in
the importation of heroin worth over $1.6 billion into the United
States. In April, 1984, 38 individuals were indicted on charges
related to the trafficking operation, popularly known as the
&quot;Pizza Connection.&quot; The network that developed to
facilitate the traffic in this enterprise was reputedly one of
the largest heroin importation operations in history, and used
pizza parlors throughout this country to distribute heroin
smuggled from Southeast and Southwest Asia via Sicily to the
United States. Additional heroin that was trafficked through this
system was produced in laboratories operating in Sicily. </p>

<p>According to the indictment in the case, the &quot;Pizza
Connection&quot; heroin network relied upon a faction of the New
York Bonanno organized crime family headed by Salvatore Catalano
to distribute the heroin in this country. In turn, the heroin
business of this Bonanno crime faction was tied directly to
organized criminal groups in Sicily, the rest of Italy,
Switzerland, Spain, and Brazil. Direct evidence of the existence
of the network was first obtained in 1980 when couriers were
observed transferring enormous amounts of cash through investment
houses and banks in New York city to Italy and Switzerland. Tens
of millions of dollars derived from heroin sales in this country
were transferred overseas in this fashion, apparently in
violation of the Bank Secrecy Act. </p>

<p>Investigations related to the &quot;Pizza Connection&quot;
case have revealed that factions of the Sicilian Mafia operate in
the United States independently of the American La Cosa Nostra.
While the two groups apparently cooperate on certain ventures
such as the &quot;Pizza Connection&quot; heroin importation
operations, they appear to be distinct and separate organizations
under different leadership. </p>

<h2>Drug Abuse, Drug Trafficking, &amp; Organized Crime </h2>

<p><b>President's Commission on Organized Crime, 1986 </b></p>

<hr>

<h2>Chapter III Part 2: Marijuana Trafficking </h2>

<p>Marijuana trafficking presents both unique opportunities and
significant disadvantages for the smugglers who provide the drug
to American consumers. The volume of demand for marijuana
precludes domination of the market by any group of traffickers
and allows a constant influx of small-scale and mid-size
operators as limited suppliers. These smaller groups are in large
part able to enter the market because of marijuana's
comparatively low wholesale cost. While an investment of tens of
thousands of dollars is required for entry into the U.S. heroin
or cocaine traffic, a capital investment of less than $10,000 is
generally sufficient in the marijuana trade. Finally, although
marijuana is supplied to U.S. consumers by growers in Colombia,
Mexico and Jamaica, nearly one-sixth of the U.S. supply is
domestically grown. Because significant amounts of the drug are
cultivated in all 50 States, American traffickers need not travel
to a foreign source country for a marijuana supply. </p>

<p>While the barriers to entry in the U.S. marijuana traffic are
relatively low, marijuana sales generate a small profit in
comparison to other illicit drugs. This is primarily because
marijuana, unlike heroin or cocaine, in not diluted or
&quot;cut&quot; in the intermediate phases of trafficking, but is
sold in much the same form at the wholesale and retail levels.
Marijuana is bulky and difficult to transport in high-profit
quantity: the profit generated from the retail sale of 700 pounds
of commercial Colombian marijuana could most probably be equalled
from the retail sale of one kilogram of diluted cocaine. Finally,
trafficking marijuana implies increased risks of interdiction
because the bulk of the drug makes it most visible to law
enforcement authorities. </p>

<p>Despite the relative ease with which small-scale traffickers
can enter the marijuana market, only large criminal organizations
have the resources and connections necessary to generate large
profits from marijuana trafficking. Many of these groups deal in
other drugs in addition to marijuana, and are organized to
facilitate the movement of any drug to the United States with
minimal interference from law enforcement authorities. Their size
allows group control of all aspects of a trafficking venture from
cultivation through the wholesale transaction, thus eliminating
middlemen, decreasing costs and maximizing profit. Unlike smaller
operations, the major trafficking groups have the capital
required to purchase the large vessels, trucks, or planes
necessary for smuggling high profit multi-ton quantities of
marijuana. A final advantage is their willingness to use violence
and corruption, the tools traditionally associated with organized
crime, to ensure the success of smuggling ventures. </p>

<p>Historical Context </p>

<p>From the 1930's through the mid-1970's, Mexican growers and
traffickers supplied nearly all of the marijuana consumed in the
United States. Most shipments of the drug were smuggled into this
country by car or truck; a small percentage was transported by
air. The Mexican monopoly ended in 1975, when in a joint venture,
U.S. and Mexican authorities increased marijuana interdiction and
eradication efforts in major Mexican cultivation regions and
along the U.S. borders. Paraquat, a potent herbicide toxic to
humans, was used widely in the eradication program, and
contaminated much of the Mexican crop. Despite the interdiction
efforts, a portion of the tainted marijuana was successfully
smuggled into the United States, and many Americans who smoked
the drug subsequently suffered adverse health consequences.
Eradication and interdiction of the Mexican crop, compounded by
the American marijuana smokers' reluctance to purchase a
potentially paraquat-tainted drug, resulted in a simultaneous
decrease in the availability of and the demand for Mexican
marijuana. By 1979 Mexico supplied only an estimated 11 percent
of the marijuana available in the United States and by 1981 that
figure dropped to 4 percent. </p>

<p>Concurrent with the commitment of more manpower and resources
to marijuana eradication and interdiction efforts in Mexico,
authorities in Jamaica, which was the source of the 10 percent of
the American supply not originating in Mexico, mounted a similar
campaign. The Jamaican initiatives significantly reduced
marijuana production and trafficking in that country, and
virtually eliminated Jamaica from the American marijuana trade
for a number of years. </p>

<p>During the mid-1970's America's two marijuana supply sources,
traffickers in Mexico and Jamaica, had only small amounts of the
drug available for export. The resulting vacuum was swiftly
filled by Colombian criminal groups, who for years had been
involved in smuggling all manner of contraband. Through the late
1960's these groups increased cultivation of marijuana in remote
regions of the Guajira Peninsula and began to develop systems to
facilitate the transport of multi-ton quantities of the drug to
the United States. At the same time, many Colombian groups were
establishing themselves as major operators in the cocaine trade:
the organizational structures, trafficking routes and corrupted
officials necessary for cocaine ventures often proved equally
useful for marijuana trafficking. </p>

<p>Once the Colombians established a position as marijuana
traffickers, their role in the traffic expanded rapidly. By 1975
airstrips capable of handling heavy 4-engine planes with the
capacity to hold one ton of marijuana were common along the
Guajira Peninsula. Loading facilities for
&quot;motherships,&quot; large vessels capable of transporting
tons of marijuana, dotted the coast. By the early 1980's a
Congressional committee estimated that between 15 and 60 thousand
tons of marijuana were exported from that country to the United
States each year. </p>

<p>In 1985 Colombia remains the major supplier of U.S. marijuana,
but the Colombian share of the market has declined significantly
since 1980. This decrease is attributed to increased eradication
in Colombia and to accelerated interdiction along major
trafficking routes. Colombia's reduced production has been offset
by increased cultivation and trafficking both in Mexico and
Jamaica. Mexico, now ranked second in world marijuana production,
could become the leading producer in 1986, given a Mexican bumper
harvest and continuing eradication in Colombia. </p>

<p>This short history of marijuana trafficking demonstrates that
law enforcement pressure in a particular cultivation area is
compensated by production and trafficking increases elsewhere.
Trafficking organizations are positioned in all major source
countries to handle increased volume when opportunities present. </p>

<p>Trafficking Today: Colombia </p>

<p>Colombia supplied 42 percent of the marijuana consumed in the
United States in 1984. The major percentage of this traffic was
controlled by large Colombian criminal organizations. </p>

<p>Although the Colombian marijuana crop is cultivated in several
regions of the country, the largest production occurs along the
Guijara Peninsula. Colombian traffickers purchase marijuana from
growers, and sometimes provide protection and additional
financing for cultivation. Crops are harvested twice each year,
with the largest harvest occurring in the fall. The harvest
pattern directly affects the level of marijuana trafficking
activity between Colombia and the United States; trafficking is
naturally heaviest after the fall harvest. </p>

<p>Nearly 90 percent of the marijuana exported from Colombia is
shipped to the United States by sea; almost all the remainder is
transported on general aviation aircraft. Both maritime and air
traffic are primarily concentrated along Colombia's north coast,
although some percentage of the traffic is centered along the
country's Pacific coast. </p>

<p>The major portion of Colombian marijuana is shipped to the
United States on large motherships. These ships are typically
fishing vessels or freighters and can hold tons of marijuana; a
100-foot mothership can transport SO tons and a 400 foot
mothership can ship over 100 tons of the drug. These ships,
generally owned or at least controlled by Colombian trafficking
organizations, remain at sea or in selected Colombian ports until
a shipment is prepared for export and transported to a beach site
along the Colombian coast. There are more than 100 such sites
along the north coast from Barranquilla to Portete, all which are
linked by a network of roads, trails and airstrips to the major
growing areas. When preparations are complete on shore, the
mothership moves into a prearranged loading point typically
one-half to 3 miles offshore. Small boats then ferry bales of
marijuana from shore to the mothership; loading of many tons may
be accomplished within an hour. Motherships are nearly always
loaded at night to decrease risks of detection. </p>

<p>The loaded motherships generally either sail from the Guajira
coast directly to the southeastern United States or to Caribbean
transshipment points, where cargo is off-loaded for future
pickup. Traffickers use the same maritime routes popular with
cocaine traffickers; the Windward Passage between Cuba and Haiti,
the Yucatan Channel between Mexico and Cuba, and the Mona
Passage, bordered by the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico, are
most frequently traveled. From these routes American ports along
the Gulf of Mexico and the east coast are accessible to
smugglers. In addition, a small percentage of Colombian ships now
sail directly to the U.S. west coast. </p>

<p>Those motherships that approach the U.S. coast typically hover
50-100 miles offshore in international waters. There, they are
met by small ships, typically purchased or rented shrimp boats,
which off-load and ferry the drug shipment to shore. While
traffickers traditionally made no attempt to conceal bales of
marijuana, either on motherships or on off-loading vessels,
increased law enforcement surveillance has recently prompted
smugglers to hide their drugs in secret compartments or in empty
or false fuel tanks. </p>

<p>The Colombian trafficking organization normally oversees the
cultivation and export of marijuana only through the off-loading
procedure. Off-loading is accomplished by &quot;service
providers&quot; who never actually own the marijuana, but who
merely collect a fee for its safe transfer. Once on the U.S.
shore, the drug shipment is delivered to a distributor, who in
turn supplies lower level dealers. The traffic below the
wholesale distributor level is vast and not well-understood. </p>

<p>Motherships that do not travel to the United States generally
transit the Bahamas and/or the Caribbean. In both regions
marijuana traffickers can either transfer shipments from
motherships to smaller crafts, which sail to the United States,
or they can unload and store shipments at island storage bases.
Use of island transshipment points has increased as law
enforcement efforts have intensified along the southeastern U.S.
coast. Rampant official corruption in a number of island nations
facilitates this traffic. </p>

<p>An estimated 3 percent of the marijuana shipped from Colombia
to the United States by sea is transported on commercial vessels.
Typically, marijuana is concealed in containerized cargo, but in
some instances crewmen or cruise ship passengers have been
directly implicated in trafficking the drug. In terms of
quantity, cargo shipment provides great opportunities for
traffickers and presents a decreased risk of interdiction. </p>

<p>Air Shipment </p>

<p>An estimated 10 percent of the marijuana smuggled from
Colombia to the United States reaches this country via general
aviation aircraft or commercial air shipment. Non-commercial air
shipment of marijuana parallels the Colombian air trafficking
patterns common in cocaine smuggling. Many of the same air routes
and transshipment points are used; the same airstrips are
accessible along the north coast of the country, and the same
methods used to avoid law enforcement interference are
applicable. Smugglers use both smaller twin engine aircraft and
larger four-engine planes for marijuana transport. When air
transport allows faster shipment, it limits export quantities and
increases the likelihood of interdiction. </p>

<p>A small portion of the marijuana exported from Colombia is
shipped by aircraft, then air-dropped over sea or land for pickup
and further shipment to the United States. Most airdrop activity
occurs in the Bahamas, but an increasing number of drops have
been intercepted in the Yucatan Peninsula, Jamaica, Haiti, the
Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico. Medium-size to large twin
engine aircraft are typically used for air-drop operations. </p>

<p>In addition to trafficking marijuana to the United States or
transshipment points, Colombian organizations sell marijuana
directly to non-Colombian traffickers, who assume responsibility
for the shipment in Colombia. The buyers then traffic the drug
into the United States using maritime and air shipment systems
similar to the Colombian methods. </p>

<p>Mexico </p>

<p>Mexican marijuana production nearly doubled from 1983 to 1984,
positioning Mexico as the second leading supplier of the drug to
the United States. An estimated 20 percent of the marijuana
available for consumption in the United States originates in or
transits Mexico, and that figure is expected to increase with a
bumper harvest in 1985. PEA analysts predict that this increased
production, with concomitant eradication and interdiction
successes in Colombia, could make Mexico the top American
marijuana source in 1985. </p>

<p>Although marijuana is grown in nearly every state in Mexico,
heaviest cultivation occurs in the northern and western states of
Sonora, Sinaloa, Chihuahua, Oaxaca and Cuerra. As in Colombia,
crops are harvested twice each year, with the largest harvest in
the fall. Cultivation occurs both in small open fields and in
well-maintained, hundred-acre sites. Growers are typically
overseen and financed by larger trafficking organizations. </p>

<p>Harvested marijuana is prepared for shipment near the
cultivation fields. Mexican marijuana is transported to the
United States by primarily overland methods, although aircraft
are also used to smuggle drugs across the border. Overland
shipments are typically concealed in automobile trucks, false
truck beds, camper tops and tanker trunks. The larger trucks
commonly haul multi-ton quantities: U.S. officials at El Paso,
Texas, seized nearly 6.5 tons of marijuana from a tanker truck in
February 1984, and nearly 30 tons from a cargo truck in March of
that year. In addition, suitcases of marijuana are often
forwarded on commercial bus lines to destinations beyond border
checkpoints for subsequent pick-up. </p>

<p>Air shipments generally run between private Mexican airstrips
and clandestine runways or drop spots in the southwestern United
States. Single engine aircraft are popular with Mexican smugglers
because they can land on open fields, roadways and rough landing
strips common on both sides of the border, and typically carry
about 1,500 pounds of marijuana. While few details are available
concerning marijuana air shipment, the great assortment of
airstrips on both sides of the border suggests a significant
volume of air traffic. A 1977 survey, for example, detected
nearly 3,000 airstrips in Mexico; one-half of them were
concentrated in ten major clusters. About 600 strips lie along
the United States border and are ideally positioned to serve
either as launching sites for flights into the United States or
as refueling stops for flights en route to this country from
southern Mexico. Strips in the other clusters most likely serve
as refueling and transshipment points for aircraft traveling
between South America and the United States. A large number of
airstrips in the southeastern United States serve as landing
sites for the Mexican flights. </p>

<p>Larger Mexican criminal organizations appear to control a
significant portion of the marijuana traffic between Mexico and
the United States. Many groups are active in both cocaine and
heroin smuggling as well as marijuana trafficking. The central
organizations are generally controlled by members of one extended
family, but often include non-family members in lower positions.
Like other trafficking groups, the Mexicans rely consistently on
an essential criminal support of attorneys, bankers and other
professionals, both in Mexico and in the United States. </p>

<p>Prominent among the larger Mexican organizations are the
groups headed by Jamie Herrera Navarres, Rafael Caro Quintero,
Ernesto Fonesca and Miguel Felix Gallardo. These groups
collaborate in smuggling ventures, much as the major Colombian
cocaine trafficking organizations work in concert to maximize
resources and profits. In one recent instance, for example, a
consortium of traffickers led by Caro Quintero cultivated
hundreds of hectares of marijuana at five separate large-scale
sites throughout the state of Chihuahua. All fields were
landscaped, fertilized and well-irrigated, demonstrating the
Mexican traffickers' knowledge of high-tech agricultural
techniques. The cultivation sites, along with eight associated
processing camps, were seized by Mexican authorities in November
1984. The seizures netted 10,000 metric tons of whole marijuana,
or an estimated 1,900 to 2,400 tons of net marketable marijuana.
In this single operation, officials confiscated 8 times more
marijuana than Mexican and American authorities at the time
believed was produced annually throughout Mexico. The seizure
raised serious questions both about the magnitude of drug traffic
between Mexico and the United States and about continuing
official corruption throughout Mexico. It seems highly unlikely
that an operation the size of the Chihuahua system could develop
or function without earlier detection by authorities. </p>

<p>Jamaica </p>

<p>Jamaica, from 1980 to 1984 this country's second leading
marijuana supplier, provided 14 percent of the United States
market share in 1984, trailing Colombia's 42 percent and Mexico's
20 percent contributions. Jamaican traffickers, much less highly
organized than their counterparts in Colombia and Mexico,
supplied about 1800 metric tons of marijuana, as well as smaller
amounts of sinsemilla and hashish oil to United States consumers
in 1984. </p>

<p>The greatest portion of Jamaican marijuana is transported to
the United States by general aviation aircraft, although some
maritime shipment also occurs. Over 70 island airstrips, one-half
of which are clandestine, facilitate the air traffic, which
commonly includes shipment by single engine and light to heavy
twin engine aircraft. Jamaican marijuana shipments are typically
either flown directly to United States landing sites or are
air-dropped to small pleasure craft in waters near the Bahamas. </p>

<p>Multi-ton marijuana shipments are occasionally transported to
the United States on small motherships, pleasure craft and cruise
ships. A small percentage of Jamaican marijuana exported to the
United States is concealed in containerized cargo on commercial
maritime vessels. </p>

<p>The United States Crop </p>

<p>The United States is currently a significant marijuana source
country: about 12 percent of the marijuana consumed in the United
States in 1984 was domestically cultivated. The largest crops are
grown in Hawaii, California, and Oklahoma, but there is now some
production in every State. Growers can be landowners, but are
typically squatters who operate independently or in small groups.
They cultivate their crops in Federal fields, forested land,
private clandestine plots or greenhouses, scattering plants next
to trees or amid legitimate crops to avoid detection. Planting on
Federal land offers growers the advantage of anonymity and
shields them from recently enacted laws which authorize seizure
of their property or other assets. Many plots, including those on
Federal parkland are wired with devices, such as punji sticks,
fish hooks hung at eye level, and trip wires attached to guns and
boulders, designed to ensure the security of the crop. Growers
are often armed and violent. </p>

<p>There is presently no evidence of a highly developed
distribution system for the domestic marijuana crop in the United
States. It appears that numerous smaller organizations traffic
the drug between states and that some individual growers supply
larger criminal organizations in major cities nationwide. These
organizations, which include both La Cosa Nostra groups and
trafficking specific groups, distribute domestic and imported
marijuana to brokers, retailers, and street-level dealers. The
extent of their control of the U.S. market is uncertain but
estimated to be significant. </p>

<p>The Role of the LCN </p>

<p>In 1967 Federal officials reported that the LCN was not
significantly involved In trafficking marijuana. Low profit was
thought to be the primary disincentive to La Cosa Nostra
involvement; in addition, the large and loosely structured market
was thought to be unattractive and uncontrollable. In the late
1960's the United States marijuana supply was exported almost
exclusively from Mexico. Entry into the trafficking business
required little capital and a simple border crossing, and thus
attracted many small and independent operators. When Colombia
became the major United States marijuana supplier in the early
1970's, however, the LCN was provided with a more controllable
source. Concurrent with this production shift, the United States
demand for marijuana and the retail price level for the drug
steadily escalated, prompting some LCN families to become
involved in trafficking marijuana. For a short period, this
activity proved to be a high profit/low risk enterprise for
traditional organized crime. Additionally, trafficking marijuana
carried little of the social stigma associated with trafficking
heroin or cocaine. </p>

<p>As the following case study demonstrates, marijuana
trafficking has increased the vulnerability of some organized
crime families and has led to a number of significant LCN
arrests. </p>

<p>Case Study: The Cleveland Connection </p>

<p>In the mid-1970's, Carmen Zagaria, a Cleveland drug dealer,
began to buy wholesale marijuana by the pound and sell it at
retail in one ounce bags. He rapidly expanded his business in the
course of a few years and developed a network of suppliers,
couriers and distributors. Although the business prospered
generally, Zagaria lost a substantial investment in one foiled
drug transaction in 1979 and borrowed money from Angelo Lonardo,
the reputed underboss of the Cleveland LCN Licavoli family. In
return for the loan, the Licavoli family assumed control of the
Zagaria operation. </p>

<p>Under Lonardo's oversight, the Zagaria enterprise expanded
rapidly. By 1980 the organization was buying 400-800 pounds of
marijuana per week and had incorporated over 20 couriers. PCP,
LSD, cocaine and hashish were added to the traffic. </p>

<p>The methods used by Zagaria were simple. His couriers flew to
the southeastern United States, usually to Florida via commercial
airline, and established contact there with a Zagaria supplier.
Suppliers included both LCN affiliates and non-LCN dealers.
Couriers picked up large marijuana shipments, paid for them in
cash, and drove the drugs back to Cleveland in rental cars. In
Cleveland the shipments were stored in stash houses, then
distributed to a network of wholesalers and retailers. The
Zagaria enterprise was a high-volume multimillion dollar
operation; in a single 10-day period in 1980 the group brought
3,000 pounds of marijuana to Cleveland from Atlanta. </p>

<p>In the course of his trafficking business Zagaria was involved
in numerous crimes, including murder. In 1982 he was convicted of
selling seven pounds of marijuana and 21 grams of cocaine and was
sentenced to 10-30 years in prison. Zagaria became a Federal
informant and though never a member of the Licavoli family
himself, provided sufficient testimony about family activities to
bring the leadership before a grand jury. In 1983 Angelo Lonardo
and five other Licavoli associates were convicted and
incarcerated without possibility of parole for numerous crimes,
including conspiracy to distribute marijuana. </p>

<p>Other Drugs </p>

<p>Millions of Americans abuse a number of licit and illicit
drugs other than heroin, cocaine and marijuana; these include
stimulants, synthetic narcotics, hallucinogens, and depressants.
Most popular among these dangerous drugs are diazepam (Valium),
methamphetamine and PCP. In addition, controlled substance
analogs known commonly as &quot;designer drugs,&quot; have gained
popularity with users since 1980. </p>

<p>Dangerous drugs are available to the consumer from three major
sources. Many of the drugs are approved for medical use in the
United States, and reach the illicit market through a variety of
diversion methods. A significant portion of the United States
supply of certain drugs, notably amphetamines and diazepam, is
diverted from licit channels in foreign countries and smuggled
into the United States. Finally, it is estimated that all the PCP
and chemical analogs, nearly all the methamphetamine and about 80
percent of the injectable amphetamine available on the illicit
market in 1984 were produced in clandestine United States
laboratories. </p>

<p>Only certain areas of the traffic in dangerous drugs clearly
reflect organized crime involvement. Most notably, the traffic
appears to be dominated nationwide by outlaw motorcycle gangs.
According to the Commission's survey of local law enforcement
officials, these gangs control nearly 40 percent of the
&quot;dangerous drug&quot; traffic in the United States. While
these gangs have traditionally been active in trafficking a wide
variety of illicit drugs, they have developed the technology to
manufacture methamphetamine and PCP, and have been a major force
in the wholesale and resale distribution of these two drugs
nationwide. </p>

<p>The major outlaw motorcycle gangs traffic dangerous drugs
within separate territorial boundaries: the Hell's Angels control
the West Coast trade, the Outlaws dominate the Midwest and parts
of the east coast, the Bandidos control the Southwest, and
Eastern Seaboard States are dominated by the Pagans. Officials
are uncertain of the total membership of the four groups, but
estimate that nearly all the U.S. traffic in PCP, and up to
three-fourths of the illicit methamphetamine traffic falls under
their control. </p>

<p>The Hell's Angels, the oldest of the four groups, first became
involved in drug distribution in the late 1960's. Initially, the
group trafficked marijuana, heroin, cocaine, seconal, PCP,
amphetamines and methamphetamines. In the early 1970's the
organization recruited a chemist to manufacture methamphetamine
and to instruct other organization members in the procedure.
Hell's Angels' activity shifted as their production of
methamphetamine increased and within a short period of time, the
organization dominated west coast methamphetamine manufacture and
distribution. </p>

<p>In the eastern United States, the Pagan's gang leadership also
recruited chemists and gained control of the methamphetamine and
PCP markets from Florida to New England. Pagan drug activity is
centered in the Philadelphia/ South New Jersey area; several
Pagan-controlled processing centers and small laboratories are
located in the region. It is known by law enforcement officials
that Pagan gang members have frequently cooperated in joint
ventures with the Philadelphia Bruno organized crime family,
especially in methamphetamine and PCP manufacture and
distribution. Officials believe that the Bruno leadership
regularly finances a portion of Pagan drug activities in return
for a percentage of the drug profits and enforcement and
protection services. In addition, it appears that the Pagans and
the Bruno family have arranged to divide control of the
methamphetamine and PCP markets in certain territories and that
the two groups coexist and cooperate in these regions. </p>

<p>Case Study: The Pagan/Bruno Relationship. </p>

<p>Between 1977 and 1981 both the Pagan motorcycle gang and the
Bruno organized crime family were active and competitive
distributors of methamphetamine throughout the mid-Atlantic
states. Both groups obtained P2P, an essential chemical in
methamphetamine production, from Ronald Raiton, the major
supplier of the chemical in the eastern United States. Raiton
supplied P2P directly to Ronald Kownacki, a businessman closely
aligned with the Pagan leadership, and to Ronald Martorano, a
Bruno family associate. Though Kownacki and Martorano both
operated in the Philadelphia area, their laboratories and
clientele were distinct. </p>

<p>Kownacki paid the Bruno family a $10,000 fee for every gallon
of P2P he purchased from Raiton. He sold the methamphetamine he
produced to Pagan Walter &quot;Buckets&quot; Jozwiak, who cut the
drug and distributed it to Pagan mother club members in New
Jersey, Delaware and Philadelphia. Martorano distributed his
methamphetamine through Bruno family channels. </p>

<p>In 1980 Kownacki was assaulted and robbed by two Bruno
associates, who claimed they were collecting a debt owed to the
Bruno family. They stole a significant amount of gold from
Kownacki, which he maintained belonged to the Pagans. In February
1981 a number of Pagans confronted members of the Bruno family
and demanded that the gold be returned. The Bruno associates
refused, but agreed to meet with the Pagans to negotiated
possible joint ventures in trafficking methamphetamine and PCP.
Finally in 1982 the Pagans and the Bruno family agreed that each
group would control methamphetamine and PCP markets in separate
territories and that competition between them in these areas
would cease. In 1983 after the agreement, the estimated street
value of the Pagan PCP and methamphetamine operations was $15.5
million. </p>

<p>Organized crime involvement in trafficking dangerous drugs
other than methamphetamine and PCP in the United States is not
well-documented. La Cosa Nostra appears to be active in
trafficking methaqualone from Colombia through Florida to major
United States cities, but the scope of their interest in this
market is not known. Mexican traffickers have smuggled
significant quantities of diazepam, methaqualone and amphetamine
into this country for at least ten years. A major portion of the
illicit methaqualone traditionally available in this country was
trafficked to the United States by Colombian organized crime
groups; however, international controls adopted by virtually all
major producing and exporting countries have led to worldwide
shortage of the drug. </p>

<p>The DEA currently reports that organized crime is not now
involved in the production or distribution of controlled
substance analogs, &quot;designer drugs.&quot; Given the enormous
profit potential of these substances, however, and the relatively
simple manufacturing processes required in their production, the
formulation and distribution of controlled substance analogs
would seem to be an endeavor perfectly suited to organized crime.
</p>

<p>Drug Trafficking, Terrorism, and Insurgency </p>

<p>Drug trafficking organizations in many areas of the world
coexist and cooperate with political insurgent groups and
terrorists. Their typical relationship is mutually beneficial:
traffickers supply terrorists with American currency and weapons
in return for protection and assistance in smuggling activities.
While terrorists and insurgents do not currently control
significant portions of the drug trade, the profit potentially
realized from even isolated drug transactions could provide
sizable revenues for a militant cause. Terrorists and insurgents
funded through drug trafficking could very conceivably become
powerful enough to disrupt governments in a number of countries
presently allied with the United States, and thus pose a serious
threat to this country's national security. </p>

<p>The role of terrorists and insurgents in drug trafficking has
expanded greatly since the early 1970's as drug trafficking has
spread across the world. At that time, heroin traffic was
controlled by North American organized crime groups working with
Sicilian suppliers in the French Connection, marijuana was
supplied to the United States almost exclusively by Mexican
trafficking organizations, and cocaine traffic in this country
was insignificant. Heroin now reaches North America from Europe,
the Middle East, Mexico and Southeast Asia. Marijuana is
trafficked to the United States by Colombian and Caribbean based
groups as well as by Mexicans, and cocaine from nearly every
country in South America satisfies a still-increasing demand for
the drug throughout this country. </p>

<p>At the same time, the expanded United States market for
illicit drugs has swelled the profit from trafficking to enormous
proportions, and attracted terrorist and insurgent groups to this
activity. In addition, this source of funding serves the
ideological purposes of many groups. As explained by terrorism
expert Michael Ledeen: </p>

<p>Running drugs is one sure way to make big money in a hurry.
Moreover, the directions of the flow are ideologically
attractive. Drugs go to the bourgeois countries, where they
corrupt and where they kill, while the arms go to pro-Communist
terrorist groups in the Third World. </p>

<p>The links between terrorist and insurgent groups and
traffickers are most substantial in drug source countries,
including Colombia, Peru, Burma and Thailand. In Colombia, four
major insurgent organizations work in collaboration with cocaine
traffickers. The oldest, largest, and best-equipped of these
groups is the Revolutionary Armed Force of Colombia (FARC), which
is the armed wing of the Colombian Communist Party (PCC) and
claims over 5,000 active members and supporters. The FARC forces
consist of between 23 and 28 &quot;fronts,&quot; essentially
independent company-level forces, nearly all of which are located
in Colombia's rural areas. Over one-half of the fronts operate in
coca and marijuana growing regions. FARC forces cultivate some
coca, but derive more profit by collecting protection payments
from coca growers in their operating territory, often demanding a
10 percent share of the drug profits. One FARC front reportedly
obtained over $3.8 million per month by assessing this protection
tax. Collected monies are used to buy weapons and supplies which
are often shipped into Colombia on return drug flights. Two FARC
fronts have had documented direct dealings with cocaine
traffickers to obtain arms and ammunition. </p>

<p>In exchange for the levied fee, the FARC forces protect
growing and trafficking areas, including air fields, and warn
traffickers of nearby anti-narcotics police or military patrols.
In certain areas of Colombia FARC fronts control enough strategic
points to make police travel difficult or impossible. </p>

<p>FARC encampments have recently been discovered in close
proximity to several major cocaine processing centers. For
example, on April 6, 1984, during a raid of a fully operational
processing center in Southeast Colombia known as &quot;La
Loma,&quot; officials discovered and subsequently destroyed a
FARC guerrilla base camp. The FARC camp, complete with airstrips
and large stockpiles of food and medical supplies, that group's
direct involvement in providing protection for the cocaine
traffickers. A month prior to the La Loma raid, when authorities
raided another processing center nearby known as Tranquilandia,
they were met by approximately 30 armed resistors in fatigue
uniforms believed to be FARC members. </p>

<p>A number of other militant organizations in Colombia have also
been associated with the drug trade. The leftist 19th of April
movement (M-19) has been most notable for its October 1985
takeover of the Colombian Palace of Justice in which 11 of that
country's Supreme Court Justices were murdered. Although M-19 was
once hostile to traffickers, and on several occasions kidnapped
relatives of prominent drug smugglers, some officials maintain
that the October incident was related to drug trafficking. It is
alleged that the attack was motivated by the M-19's desire to
destroy records that might lead to the extradition a number of
major Colombian cocaine traffickers, and to intimidate
authorities in Colombia to force them to rescind the extradition
treaty in effect between that country and the United States. M-19
also at least once traded drugs for arms from Cuba through
Colombian trafficker Jaime Guillot-Lara. In the early 1970's to
1982 Guillot supplied M-19 with weapons in return for their
assistance in his drug smuggling activities through high-ranking
Cuban officials. The Cubans provided a safe haven for Guillot's
drug smuggling vessels en route to the United States from
Colombia in return for payments. M-19 received periodic weapons
shipments for facilitating the arrangement on Guillot Lara's
return trips to Colombia from the United States. </p>

<p>In Peru, where an estimated 40 percent of the world coca crop
is grown, insurgents and traffickers share much the same
relationship evidenced by the Colombians. Insurgents and growers
work in the same remote areas, primarily in the upper Huallaga
Valley, but operate separately. Smugglers supply arms and money
are supplied in return for militant protection. The two groups do
not maintain a structured relationship or pursue common goals;
their collaboration is one of convenience. </p>

<p>The most prominent insurgent group currently operating in Peru
is the Maoist Shining Path (Sendero Luminoso), which seeks a
rural-based revolution to rid the predominantly peasant
population of the &quot;imperialistic&quot; influences of the
United States and other foreign governments. While existing
evidence is insufficient to link the Shining Path to the drug
trade, the group has incited peasants, many of whom make their
living from coca cultivation, to rebel against anti-coca projects
in major growing areas. During 1984 several anti-coca projects,
including a United States-supported crop substitution program,
were attacked by armed mobs, resulting in many injuries and
deaths. </p>

<p>In Southeast Asia a number of political insurgent groups rely
principally on heroin smuggling to finance their activities. They
control or influence the main areas of opium production in
northeastern Burma, where the Burmese government does not exert
authority. The insurgents range from ideological revolutionaries
like the Burmese Communist Party (BCP), to ethnic separatists,
such as the Kachin Independence Organization (KIO), and opium
warlords, like the Shan United Army (SUA). All of these groups,
whatever their professed objectives, are heavily involved in the
production, transport or sale of heroin. </p>

<p>In Burma, where 90 percent of the southeast Asian opium crop
is grown, the BCP controls an estimated two-thirds of the major
opium production areas and levies a protection tax on
cultivators. While the BCP has traditionally controlled opium
cultivation and the SUA has exclusively dominated associated
refining and trafficking activities, the BCP has recently begun
to engage in processing and sales, and the groups have come into
conflict. The BCP remains an active political insurgency while
the SUA now concentrates its resources almost entirely on the
drug trade. </p>

<p>In Thailand the link between insurgency and drug trafficking
is much weaker. Although Burmese groups operated with relative
impunity on both sides of the Burma/Thailand border in the early
1980's, government initiatives in Thailand have severely
disrupted their activities. The only indigenous Thai insurgent
group of any consequence, the Communist Party of Thailand (CPT),
is reportedly ready to engage in drug trafficking, but has been
kept under control by Thai security forces. </p>

<p>In the Middle East, nearly all the militant groups engage in
struggle in Lebanon - Palestinians, Phalangists, Druze and
Shiites - reportedly are financed in some part by the drug trade.
Lebanon's Bekaa Valley is the site of significant hashish
production; heroin laboratories are also believed to exist in the
area. Terrorists throughout that area can and do enter the drug
trade, either directly or by protecting drugs transshipped
through regions they control. </p>

<p>Armenian terrorists are also active in Lebanon, especially in
Beirut, where Armenian nationals are heavily involved in drug
trafficking. In 1980 Noubar Sofoyan, an Armenian heroin and
hashish trafficker connected with the right-wing Justice
Commandos of the Armenian Genocide, was indicted in the U.S. for
heroin smuggling. Sofoyan allegedly helped fund the 1976 bombing
of a Turkish installation in Zurich. He was arrested in Greece on
drug charges in 1981 and was subsequently extradited to Lebanon
and released; he remains a fugitive today. </p>

<p>Traffickers as Terrorists </p>

<p>While drug traffickers are not by definition terrorists or
insurgents, they rely heavily on terrorist tactics to obtain
limited political objectives. The use of threats, violence,
assassination and kidnapping by trafficking organizations to
prevent vigorous enforcement of drug laws can only be categorized
as terroristic in nature. </p>

<p>The use of terrorist tactics is most evident among traffickers
in Colombia, Peru and Mexico. In Colombia much of the violence
centers on the issue of the extradition of reputed Colombian drug
traffickers to the United States for trial. The extradition issue
has become prominent in the past two years under Colombian
President Belisario Betancur, and has prompted unprecedented
levels of terrorism by traffickers. Two key members of the
Colombian government, Minister of Justice Rodrigo Lara-Bonilla
and Justice Ministry Assistant Eduardo Gonzalez, both outspoken
supporters of the implementation of the United States/Colombia
extradition treaty, were murdered reportedly by traffickers in
1984. The Colombian judiciary, the body responsible both for the
investigation of drug cases and the disposition of extradition
requests, has been targeted by traffickers. Twenty-four judges,
among them the judge investigating the Lara assassination, have
been murdered in the past two years. Americans have also been
singled out: Colombian traffickers have reportedly offered a
$350,000 bounty for the murder of any top DEA official in the
United States or in Colombia, and have threatened to kill five
Americans for every reputed Colombian drug trafficker extradited
to the United States. </p>

<p>In Peru drug-related violence has been increasing since 1983,
and has specifically targeted anti-drug efforts in the Upper
Huallaga Valley. A series of violent attacks by traffickers on
police units and eradication workers in that area led to the
November 1984 torture and murder of 19 members of a United
States-financed coca-eradication team, and subsequently to the
brutal murder of 17 United States financed eradicators by about
50 traffickers armed with submachine guns less than one year
later. Dozens of people in Peru, including policemen, mayors and
farmers have been reported killed in the past year in attacks
attributed to cocaine traffickers. </p>

<p>In Mexico trafficking violence culminated in the February
kidnapping, torture and murder of DEA Agent Enrique Camerena and
a Mexican pilot. Camerena's abduction occurred shortly after
Mexican police, alerted by DEA, raided the largest marijuana
plantation ever discovered in that country and seized an
estimated 8,500 tons of marijuana. In the course of the search
for Camerena, five persons, including a police officer, were
killed. Mexican trafficker Rafael Caro Quintero is being held by
Mexican authorities in connection with the Camerena murder. The
trafficking-related violence in Mexico escalated further in
November 1985, when 17 police officers and other members of an
anti-drug team working in southern Mexico were lured into an
ambush, tortured, and killed by a large group of drug traffickers
armed with automatic weapons. </p>

<p>Government Complicity </p>

<p>A number of hostile foreign governments, motivated either by a
need for hard American currency, or by a more ideological desire
to undermine governments in Europe and the United States,
actively facilitate drug trafficking activities. Cuban and
Nicaragua blatantly aid traffickers smuggling drugs from Colombia
to the United States; the Bulgarian government assists
traffickers transporting drug shipments from Southwest Asia to
Western Europe. All three countries are geographically
well-positioned to serve as transshipment points for drugs en
route to Europe or the United States, and all allow trafficking
routes to cross through their sovereign territory, thus providing
a way for traffickers to circumvent drug-interdiction
authorities. </p>

<p>Cuba </p>

<p>Reports of Cuban government involvement in drug trafficking
first surfaced in the early 1960's, but were in large measure
unsubstantiated. A series of reports in the 1970's subsequently
suggested Cuban Government involvement, but did not provide solid
evidence of such activity. In the early 1980's, however, the link
between the Cuban government and Colombian drug traffickers was
documented. In November 1982, the United States District Court
indicted four major Cuban officials on charges of conspiracy to
smuggle drugs; those indicted included the former Cuban
Ambassador to Colombia, two officials of the Cuban Communist
Party, and the Vice Admiral of the Cuban Navy. All four officials
were involved in facilitating the trafficking activities of
Colombian Jaime Guillot-Lara, reputedly a major marijuana,
cocaine and methaqualone trafficker. The Cuban officials,
according to the indictment, agreed to allow Cuba to be used as a
supply and loading center for Lara's ships transporting drugs to
the United States, and permitted him to navigate drug vessels
through Cuban waters to evade United States interdiction
authorities. The Cuban Government reportedly expected large
payments for their role in this traffic; on one occasion, the
government was to receive approximately $800,000 from the sale of
10 million methaqualone pills and approximately 23,000 pounds of
marijuana. </p>

<p>In addition to facilitating maritime trafficking, recent
reports indicate that drug traffickers regularly fly through
otherwise tightly controlled Cuban airspace. Traffickers
apparently have an assigned corridor which they can transit
without challenge from Cuban air defenders. Cuba also reportedly
allows Colombian traffickers to off-load drugs to other carriers
for the final journey to the United States. </p>

<p>It is often difficult in drug trafficking cases to make a
distinction between corrupt high-ranking government officials and
government-sanctioned involvement in the drug trade. Given,
however, the tight controls exerted by the Castro government's
security apparatus over foreign travel and communications, the
drug-related activities which have occurred in Cuba in recent
years almost certainly were known and approved by that country's
highest ranking officials. According to the Department of State: </p>

<p>. . . the evidence clearly indicates more than a case of
corruption by local or mid-level security officials in Cuba . . .
Narcotics trafficking has apparently been sanctioned by Cuba as a
means to finance subversion in Latin America. </p>

<p>Nicaragua </p>

<p>Since 1981, the United States has received a steady stream of
intelligence indicating that Nicaragua is used by drug
traffickers as a transshipment point between Colombia and the
United States, and that officials of the revolutionary government
there, the Sandinista Directorate, are involved in the drug
trade. Evidence further suggests that enforcement measures
implemented by Colombian President Betancur have prompted
Colombian traffickers, notably Jorge Ochoa and Pablo Escobar, to
relocate their cocaine processing facilities to Nicaragua. </p>

<p>The best evidence to date of the link between the Nicaraguan
government and Colombian drug traffickers came to light in 1984.
In that year, pilot Adler Barriman Seal, a former Ochoa cocaine
trafficking pilot working then with the DEA in an undercover
capacity, reported that Escobar and Ochoa had agreed in April
1984 to use Nicaragua as a cocaine smuggling base. At Ochoa's
request, Seal flew 750 kilos of cocaine in June, 1984 from
Colombia to an airfield just northwest of Managua. The airfield
was used generally as a joint facility by the Nicaraguan armed
forces and the Ministry of the Interior. Seal's aircraft was
damaged in the landing, and according to Seal, Frederico Vaughn,
a personal assistant to Interior Minister Thomas Borge, arranged
for him to return to the United States in another plane. Later
that June, Seal returned to the airfield in a C-123 aircraft,
equipped with a hidden camera, to retrieve the drugs. Both Vaughn
and Escobar, escorted by Nicaraguans in uniform and recorded on
videotape, personally helped Seal load the cocaine into the
aircraft. Vaughn was paid $1.5 million for providing the
Colombian traffickers &quot;secure facilities.&quot; </p>

<p>In July 1984, Seal made another trip to Nicaragua from the
United States to bring supplies for a new cocaine processing
complex under construction there. In a subsequent taped
conversation with Seal, Frederico Vaughn stated that the
processing center was ready for use. </p>

<p>Eleven persons, including Vaughn, were indicted by a Federal
grand jury on charges stemming from this trafficking arrangement.
All remain at large. It is highly unlikely that these trafficking
activities occurred without the knowledge and consent of the
Sandinista government. </p>

<p>Bulgaria </p>

<p>Since the late 1970's, reports that many drug dealers,
especially Turkish nationals, operate out of semi-permanent bases
in Bulgaria have been in circulation. The allegations against
Bulgaria include charges that the Bulgarians, primarily through
an official government trading firm, Kintex, officially sanction
the sale of illicit drugs to Western Europe and use the proceeds
from those sales to finance illegal arms transactions and to
bankroll terrorist groups. There are consistent reports that
top-ranking members of the Bulgarian Security Service or
ex-Bulgarian ministers comprise the directorate of Kintex. </p>

<p>Certain smugglers are reportedly permitted to conduct
activities within Bulgaria. In effect, Bulgarian officials,
though Kintex, assign representatives to establish fee
arrangements with smugglers for bartered contraband. Smugglers
trafficking through Bulgaria are primarily Turkish nationals of
Kurdish background, but include Syrian, Jordanian, Lebanese and
European nationals. </p>

<p>Corruption </p>

<p>The Role of the Corrupt Official </p>

<p>The corrupt official is the sine qua non of drug trafficking.
By the corruption of his office, he protects the interest of
traffickers in all phases of growing, processing and smuggling
illicit drugs. Officials &quot;from the lowly constable on
up&quot; are bribed and subverted by traffickers. </p>

<p>Mexico </p>

<p>While United States officials and investigators commonly
acknowledge that corruption among the ranks of both the Mexican
Federal Judicial Police and the Directorate of Security
facilitates drug trafficking in and through that country, they
are hesitant to make open accusations concerning the relationship
between corrupt officials and traffickers. Their reasoning is
persuasive: Mexico is a neighbor and an ally, a politically and
economically unstable one at that. The government of President
Miguel de la Madrid appears sincere in its efforts to improve the
quality of drug law enforcement throughout the country.
Nonetheless, mounting evidence prompted the Department of State
to assert in its 1985 mid-year report to Congress that: </p>

<p>There are strong indications that the Mexican [drug] program
has been less effective over the past two years, and that
corruption is playing a major role in this decline. </p>

<p>Drug-related corruption among members of Mexico's Federal
police force, which was widespread and well-publicized in the
1970's, continues to undermine anti-drug efforts in that country.
Allegations of corruption surfaced in March 1985, after DEA agent
Enrique Camarena Salazar and his pilot, Alfredo Zavala Avelar
were kidnapped and murdered in Guadalajara. Six Mexican police
officers were indicted on charges related to the Camarena murder;
they were charged with assisting drug traffickers through
&quot;protection of personnel and goods, custody of drugs in
transit, as well as continuing services of information.&quot; The
arrested officers have reportedly confessed that drug traffickers
offered them between $200 to $6,250 a month for official
protection. </p>

<p>In connection with the Camarena case, DEA officials maintain
that Jorge Armando Pavon Reyes, the First Commandante of the
Mexican Federal Judicial Police, who directed the investigation
into the Camarena murder, accepted a bribe from the trafficker
suspect in the killing, Rafael Caro Quintero, and in return
allowed Caro to leave Guadalajara. Later apprehended in Costa
Rica, Caro claimed in a confession that he paid Pavon Reyes
$265,000 to avoid arrest at the Guadalajara airport. Despite his
denials of the charges, Pavon Reyes was indicted for the crime in
Mexico in April 1985. </p>

<p>United States pressure after the Camerena murder and
subsequent revelations of corruption prompted a number of quick
responses from the Mexican Government. President de la Madrid
announced a major reorganization and consolidation of the police
forces under stronger Federal control; the governor of one
Mexican state dismissed that state's entire judicial system,
including the state attorney general, police and administrative
personnel; and a reported 100 agents of the Federal Security
Directorate, a political police force and counterintelligence
unit run by the Interior Ministry, resigned in the face of
corruption allegations. Corruption in at least some Mexican
institutions, however, appears to be deeply embedded and not
likely to be eliminated quickly or easily. At the end of
September, 1985, six months after the Camerena murder, evidence
of Mexican corruption continued to surface as the members of the
United States Fraternal Order of Border Patrol Agents charged
that: </p>

<p>Mexican federal agents, using the latest in radio and
scanner-equipped cars and armed with automatic weapons, have been
providing transit security for huge loads of domestically
produced marijuana and heroin and in-transit cocaine. </p>

<p>Bahamas and Caribbean </p>

<p>The Bahamas and a number of Caribbean countries serve as a
major refueling transshipment points for traffickers transporting
illicit drugs from Mexico and South America to the United States.
Corruption among officials at all levels throughout these
countries appears to be widespread. </p>

<p>Drug-related corruption has reached the highest offices of
government in the British-held Turks and Caicos Islands, where in
March 1985, that country's Chief Minister, Norman Saunders, was
convicted of conspiracy to travel in furtherance of a drug plot
and on five counts of traveling in furtherance of in illicit drug
transaction. Saunders, the first foreign head of state to be
convicted on drug charges, was found not guilty of more serious
charges of conspiracy to smuggle marijuana and cocaine. Trial
witnesses testified that Saunders accepted a total of $50,000 to
allow drugs to move freely through his island chain. He planned
to use the islands as a &quot;safe-haven&quot; for traffickers
smuggling illicit drugs from Colombia to the United States.
Stafford Missick, Minister of Commerce and Development in the
Saunders government, was convicted of conspiracy to import
cocaine and marijuana in the case; a third indicted Turks and
Caicos official, Aulden Smith, has not yet been tried. </p>

<p>In the Bahamas, a 1984 Commission of Inquiry investigating
drug trafficking through the Islands reported that Bahamian
officials &quot;from policemen to cabinet minister&quot; allowed
the Islands to be used as a transshipment point for illicit drugs
in return for sizeable bribes. A majority of the three-man
Commission concluded that no credible evidence directly tied
Bahamian Prime Minister Lynden Pindling to the drug-related
corruption, but noted that Pindling's bank accounts reflected
deposits of $3.5 million in excess of his salary between 1977 and
1983. </p>

<p>The Commission of Inquiry noted that a number of the Family
Island Commissioners, the representatives of the central
government on nearly all the Bahamian Islands: </p>

<p>claimed they either had no direct knowledge of drug
trafficking or had never received any complaints regarding such
activity . . . We find that to be quite remarkable and we do not
believe that they were being candid with us . . . they could not
help but know what was going on in relation to drug trafficking.
We have concluded that there must have been a degree of
acquiescence on their part . . . </p>

<p>The Commission report also charged that Colombian cocaine
trafficker Carlos Enrique Lehder Rivas operated an extensive
cocaine enterprise in the Bahamian Island of Norman's Cay from
1978 until 1982, and the Lehder paid &quot;substantial
bribes&quot; to various ranks of policemen and customs officials
to facilitate his illicit drug activities. </p>

<p>Former trafficker Luis Carcia, who transshipped marijuana and
cocaine through the Bahamas on a regular basis in the late 1970's
and early 1980's testified before the President's Commission on
Organized Crime that he had: </p>

<p>. . . never seen corruption such as there is in the Bahamas.
The policemen used to plead with me to use airstrips in their
territory so they could received the pay-off . . . sometimes
off-duty police unloaded the stuff from the plane and into the
boats for me . . . we always operated out of the Bahamas because
of the total corruption there. </p>

<p>South America </p>

<p>Official corruption has seriously hindered anti-drug efforts
throughout South America, especially in Bolivia and Peru.
Throughout Bolivia during the 1980's regime of General Garcia
Meza, corruption among high-level officials charged with drug
enforcement was so rampant that &quot;the government itself
became an international drug trafficker.&quot; Despite the
subsequent efforts the current Bolivian government to more
effectively enforce drug control laws, corruption at all levels
of the Bolivian government remains a major problem. In 1983, for
example, Bolivian authorities arrested two suspected traffickers
with a small amount of cocaine and confiscated a 14,000 acre
ranch and two airplanes belonging to them. Two weeks later, the
men were transferred to the authority of a local prosecutor who
subsequently released them and returned their possessions.
According the reports, at least $250,000 in bribes were paid to
Bolivian police and government officials for the release of the
two traffickers. </p>

<p>In August 1985, officials in Peru began a drug corruption
investigation that country's entire Interior Ministry after
authorities discovered direct telephone lines linking reputed
cocaine trafficker Reynaldo Rodriguez Lopes to officials at the
Mexican Consulate in Peru. Officials also found a government car
belonging to a top aid of former Interior Minister and Prime
Minister Luis Percovich parked in front of Lopes' home. </p>

<p>These are a few among many examples. Corruption linked to drug
trafficking is a widespread phenomenon among political and
military leaders, police and other authorities in virtually every
country touched by the drug trade. The easily available and
enormous amounts of money generated through drug transaction
present a temptation too great for many in positions of authority
to resist. </p>

<h1>America's Habit </h1>

<h2>Drug Abuse, Drug Trafficking, &amp; Organized Crime </h2>

<p><b>President's Commission on Organized Crime, 1986 </b></p>

<p><b>Note from Cliff Schaffer:</b> </p>

<p>This chapter is a summary of some of the major events in
American drug prohibition. What is most interesting about this
chapter is what it leaves out. For example, elsewhere in these
pages you will find numerous historical references to the racial
motives behind these laws. In this chapter, there is only a
passing reference to an opium law restricting trade by the
Chinese. </p>

<p>In addition, the chapter spends a good deal of time talking
about President Nixon's administration and the reorganization
which took place, but fails to mention that Nixon commissioned
the largest study of drug policy in American history, which
disagreed with his policy. </p>

<h2>Chapter IV Part 1: Federal Drug Strategy... </h2>

<p>Federal Drug Strategy: Origins, Evolution, and Current Status </p>

<p>Introduction </p>

<p>The Federal response to the national problems of drug abuse
and drug trafficking over the years has been both dynamic and
characterized by frustration. Drug use and its concomitant
organized crime effects continue to challenge the Nation to
develop a more effective and sophisticated response. Typically, a
particular Federal enforcement reaction to drug abuse and drug
trafficking has prompted drug traffickers and drug abusers to
take defensive actions, which in turn have required new or
different governmental responses. This reactive process has been
particularly characteristic of the Federal effort over the last
two decades. </p>

<p>The history of Federal drug policy that follows demonstrates
that approaches to reduce supply have been the preferred and
dominant Federal response over the last 75 years. It is only
relatively recently that the nature of the drug supply-demand
dynamic has become widely understood, leading to an increased
appreciation for and emphasis on programs to reduce demand, and
that there is still no consensus on what the role of the Federal
government in the national campaign against drug trafficking and
drug abuse should be. </p>

<p>The Early Years </p>

<p>Although use of drugs has been viewed by many Americans as a
medical problem or a personal moral shortcoming throughout this
country's history, laws regulating or proscribing such use are of
relatively recent vintage. The first significant piece of
prohibitory legislation relating to drugs in the United States
was an ordinance enacted in 1875 by the city of San Francisco
prohibiting the operation of opium dens, commercial
establishments in which the smoking of opium occurred. One
western state after another followed San Francisco's lead and
enacted legislation prohibiting opium smoking. Within eight years
of the passage of the San Francisco ordinance, Congress raised
the tariff on smoking opium, which was a relatively mild form of
opium, from $6 to $10 a pound; the tariff on opium had first been
imposed in 1842. In 1887, apparently in response to obligations
imposed upon the United States by a Chinese-American commercial
treaty negotiated in 1880, Congress prohibited the importation of
smoking opium by Chinese subjects. Despite these first
legislative efforts, the incidence of drug use and addiction
increased, as did societal concern and illegal drug smuggling. </p>

<p>Although estimates concerning the number of drug addicts
during the 50 years prior to the passage of drug legislation in
1914 are inherently suspect, the available information suggests
that drug abuse during that period was a &quot;major
medico-social problem.&quot; In fact, by 1909, the United States
was confronted with a significant and growing drug problem. The
increased opiate use and addiction in the United States
subsequent to the Civil War has been attributed to several
factors, including the indiscriminate use of morphine to treat
battlefield casualties during the Civil War. The increase in
morphine addiction was such that the phrase &quot;army
disease&quot; was used to describe the drug use among
ex-soldiers. The widespread administration of morphine by
hypodermic syringe also contributed to the increase in opiate
abuse. Other circumstances, which exacerbated the situation
during the period of 1865-1914, included the spread of opium
smoking from Chinese immigrants to American citizens, the use of
opium and its derivatives by the American patent medicine
industry, and the marketing of heroin beginning in 1898 as a
safe, powerful, and non-addictive substitute for the opium
derivatives morphine and codeine. </p>

<p>The American Opium Commission, established by an Act of
Congress in early 1908, investigated domestic opium use during
that year. In response to the results of this investigation,
Congress passed &quot;An Act to Prohibit the Importation and Use
of Opium for Other Than Medicinal Purposes&quot; in 1909, which
among other things, permitted the importation of opium for
medicinal purposes but only to 12 ports of entry. However, it did
not regulate domestic opium production and manufacture or the
interstate shipment of opium products: </p>

<p>Opium products were still available without a physician's
prescription and were being marketed throughout the country
through retail outlets and a growing mail order trade. </p>

<p>Another motivation for the passage of the 1909 Act was the
realization that the United States could not continue to advocate
measures to ameliorate the opium problem in the Far East without
taking serious steps to deal with its own &quot;home
problem.&quot; Although considered a necessary first step, the
1909 Act was subsequently adjudged to be seriously defective in
that it &quot;contain[ed] no provision against the possible
intrastate manufacture of smoking opium. It [did] no more than
exclude this form of the drug from the United States.&quot;
Because few States had effective laws against the manufacture of
smoking opium in addition to the proscriptions on its sale and
use, that gap could frustrate the objectives of Federal and State
laws. </p>

<p>Shortly before the enactment of the Act of 1909 an
International Opium Commission, consisting of the representatives
of 13 nations was convened in Shanghai at the initiative of the
United States. The Shanghai Commission has been described as the
&quot;first international effort at the solution of the opium
problem.&quot; Although originally conceived of as an
organization for investigating Far East opium use and
trafficking, the Shanghai Commission was transformed into a body
for examining worldwide opium use and trafficking because opium
addiction had spread to other parts of the world, especially to
the United States, and because producer countries were not
restricted to the Far East. The Shanghai Convention unanimously
adopted several resolutions for consideration by the governments
of the participating nations, including the following three: </p>

<p>(1) Consider the desirability of reviewing each country's
system of regulation of the use of opium in light of the
discrepancies among countries' regulatory systems; </p>

<p>(2) Adopt measures to prevent the exporting of opium and its
derivatives to countries which prohibit the importation of such
items; and </p>

<p>(3) Take measures for the gradual suppression of opium smoking
in each country's own territories and possessions. </p>

<p>Because of the unanimity achieved by the Shanghai Commission,
the United States on September 1, 1909, proposed to the other
participating countries that an international conference be held
to &quot;conventionalize the resolutions adopted at Shanghai and
their necessary consequences.&quot; The conference, which was
held at The Hague, began on December 1, 1911, and resulted in the
signing of the International Opium Convention on January 23,
1912. The Convention was ratified by the United States Senate on
October 18, 1913. The International Opium Convention committed
its signatories to the enactment of laws designed to suppress the
&quot;abuse of opium, morphine, cocaine as well as drugs prepared
or derived from these substances . . . In response to this
international obligation and to domestic considerations, the
United States passed the Harrison Act on December 17, 1914 (Ch.
1, 38 Stat. 785) , which &quot;became the cornerstone of domestic
narcotics policy&quot; for nearly 65 years. </p>

<p>The Harrison Act: 1914-1936, Early Years of Enforcement </p>

<p>Section 1 of the Harrison Act provided that any person who was
in the business of dealing in the covered drugs was required to
register annually and to pay a special annual tax of one dollar.
Section 2 made it illegal for any person to sell or in any way to
give away any of the covered drugs, except pursuant to the
written order of the person to whom the drug was being sold or
given; the written order was required to be on a form issued by
the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. Section 4 made it unlawful
for anyone who had not previously registered and paid the special
tax, required by Section 1 of the Act, to engage in interstate
trafficking in the drugs listed. With the exception of employees
of registrants and patients of physicians and dentists, Section 8
prohibited the possession of any of the drugs covered by the Act
by any person who had not registered and paid the special tax
imposed by Section I. Section 9 provided that the punishment for
any violation of the Act was to be not more than $2,000 or not
more than 5 years in prison or both. Finally, Section 10 gave the
Commissioner of Internal Revenue, subject to the approval of the
Secretary of the Treasury, the responsibility for enforcing the
Act. </p>

<p>The history of enforcement under the Harrison Act was
tremendously affected by Congress' chosen source of authority for
the legislation, its constitutional power to lay and collect
taxes. The principle of Federalism and the related concept of the
States' police power were effective constraints on the scope of
the Federal government's powers at the time of the Harrison Act,
hence the use of the constitutional authority to tax to regulate
drug-related activity. </p>

<p>Because the Harrison Act was superficially a measure designed
to raise revenue, its stated purpose dictated that the
enforcement of the Statute be the responsibility of the Treasury
Department and, by the statute's own terms, of the Commissioner
of Internal Revenue. Despite its revenue-raising veneer, its
regulatory purpose was acknowledged from the beginning: </p>

<p>Certain individuals viewed the Harrison Act as a rational way
to limit addiction and drug abuse through taxation and
regulation. It was a regulatory device which, according to the
American opium Commission, &quot;would bring the whole traffic
and use of these drugs into the light of day and, therefore,
create a public opinion against the use of them that would be
more important, perhaps, than the Act itself&quot; (Dr. Hamilton
Wright, American Opium Commission). The Act was heralded as a
method of drug abuse control and as a public awareness tool. </p>

<p>The history of early enforcement efforts under the Harrison
Act, and of the nation's drug abuse problem and policy generally,
was affected in no small degree by a series of Supreme Court
decisions that were handed down during the decade immediately
following passage of the Act. </p>

<p>The Supreme Court sustained the constitutionality of the
Harrison Act in United States v. Doremus. In deciding the issues
raised by the Government's appeal of the dismissal of the
indictment against a physician who had been registered under the
Act, the Supreme Court set forth general principles that governed
its resolution of the issues: </p>

<p>If the legislation enacted has some reasonable relation to the
exercise of the taxing authority conferred by the Constitution,
it cannot be invalidated because of the supposed motives which
induced it. </p>

<p>* * * </p>

<p>The Act may not be declared unconstitutional because its
effect may be to accomplish another purpose as well as the
raising of revenue. If the legislation is within the taxing
authority of Congress - that is sufficient to sustain it. </p>

<p>The Supreme Court sustained the constitutionality of Section 2
of the Act on the ground that it did relate to the raising of
revenue. </p>

<p>On the same day that the Supreme Court decided Doremus, it
also answered in Webb v. United States the following question in
the negative: whether an order for morphine, which is issued by a
physician to a habitual user who is not under his professional
care and which is issued not for the purpose of curing the habit
but for maintenance, is a &quot;prescription.&quot; It did so
because it concluded that &quot;to call such an order . . . a
physician's prescription would be so plain a perversion of
meaning that no discussion of the subject is required.&quot; </p>

<p>The Court extended its Webb Ruling in United States v. Behrman
by holding that an order issued by a physician for large doses of
proscribed drugs, which were not prescribed for the purpose of
treating a condition other than the addiction itself and which
were to be self-administered by the addict, to a person, who was
addicted and who was under the physician's personal care,
constituted a violation of the Harrison Act. In doing so, the
Court implicitly agreed with the district judge that
&quot;prescriptions in the regular course of practice did not
include the indiscriminate doling out of narcotics in such
quantity to addicts as charged in the indictments.&quot; </p>

<p>The Harrison Act, as construed by the Supreme Court, was the
statutory framework within which Federal drug strategies were
devised and implemented over the next half-century. However,
early enforcement efforts and priorities under the Harrison Act
did have somewhat unintended and undesirable consequences. </p>

<p>As noted previously, the responsibility for enforcement of the
Harrison Act was given initially to the Commissioner of Revenue,
subject to review by the Secretary of the Treasury. In 1915, 162
collectors and agents in the Miscellaneous Division of the
Internal Revenue Service were given the responsibility under the
Harrison Act for restricting the sale of proscribed drugs.
Meanwhile, the administration and enforcement of the National
Prohibition or the Volstead Act, which was adopted to enforce the
Eighteenth Amendment, was committed to the Commissioner of
Internal Revenue who created a prohibition unit. Because it
seemed logical to place responsibility for enforcement of the
Harrison Act within this Prohibition Unit, a Narcotics Division
was created in that unit in 1919 with a staff of 170 agents and
an appropriation of $270,000. This organizational unit for the
enforcement of the Harrison Act existed until April 1, 1927, when
legislation creating a Bureau of Prohibition and a Bureau of
Customs, to be headed by Commissioners, within the Department of
Treasury, was enacted. The 1927 legislation also transferred to
the Secretary of the Treasury all powers and duties that had been
conferred by the revenue and prohibition laws upon the
Commissioner of Revenue relating to intoxicating liquors and
narcotics. In addition, the Secretary was authorized to delegate
such powers and duties to the Commissioners of Prohibition and
Internal Revenue. The enforcement of the narcotics laws
subsequently was delegated to a narcotics unit under the
direction of the Deputy Commissioner of Prohibition. </p>

<p>Enforcement efforts under the Harrison Act from 1914 through
1929 were controversial. Following the expansive constructions of
the Harrison Act by the Supreme Court in Doremus, Webb, and
Behrman, thousands of additional prosecutions were undertaken as
a result of investigations conducted by agents of the Narcotics
Division of the Prohibition Unit. It has been estimated that over
50,000 individuals, including many physicians and others who were
required to register under the Act, were charged with violating
the Act during the period of 1914-1922. After this initial burst
of arrest activity directed against registrants, the Narcotics
Division turned its attention to closing clinics that had been
established to conduct research and treat large numbers of
addicts who could not afford private care. Because of pressure by
the American Medical Association, which had initially welcomed
the Harrison Act but which later came to view the actions of the
Narcotics Division as harassment and an improper Federal
intrusion into the practice of medicine, the Department of the
Treasury encouraged its agents to focus on the &quot;blatantly
illegal importation and sale of narcotics.&quot; </p>

<p>Despite this change in enforcement direction, the earlier
enforcement focus had a damaging, long-term impact. Because of
the mere threat of prosecution under the Act, the &quot;interest
of physicians in these cases [of narcotic addiction]&quot;
declined and &quot;they even began to refuse to prescribe.&quot;
In closing the clinics, which had been established to treat those
who were unable to afford private care, the Federal government
may have impeded - albeit unintentionally - research into
narcotic effects, use and addiction and as a result interfered
with the development of efficacious medical treatment. Finally,
the Federal government's early success in decreasing the supply
of narcotic drugs from licit sources, i.e., registrants, to drug
users forced those users to seek out illicit sources of supply. </p>

<p>The history of enforcement of the Harrison Act during the
fifteen years following its enactment illustrates the operation
of a principle that has been validated repeatedly since that
tine: drug demand will result in the creation of supply channels
to satisfy the demand. An effective drug abuse policy requires a
systematic and long-term demand reduction component;
unfortunately, there was no such component of the Federal policy
in the more than 50 years following the enactment of the Harrison
Act. </p>

<p>Enforcement efforts were burdened, however, by public
dissatisfaction with the activities of the Narcotics Division,
which was tainted by its association with the country's
anti-liquor laws. The public dissatisfaction intensified because
of a scandal involving falsification of arrest records and
charges relating to payoffs by, and collusion with, drug dealers.
In response, Congress removed the responsibility for enforcing
the Federal drug laws from the Bureau of Prohibition, which was
itself incorporated into the Department of Justice. Drug
enforcement was transferred in 1930 to a newly created Federal
Bureau of Narcotics (FBN) within the Department of the Treasury,
which was headed by a Commissioner of Narcotics. Although the FBN
was primarily responsible for the enforcement of the Harrison Act
and related drug laws, the task of preventing and interdicting
the illegal importation and smuggling of drugs remained with the
Bureau of Customs. With one major exception to be discussed at
the beginning of the next section, the Federal statutory and
organizational structure relating to narcotics that existed on
July 1, 1930, remained in place for the next 35 years. </p>

<p>1937-1969: Intensification of Pressure for Change in Federal
Drug Policy </p>

<p>Marijuana was not made subject to the Harrison Act or to the
Narcotic Drugs Import and Export Act (the Jones-Miller Act)
because it was not viewed as a particularly dangerous drug. In
addition, because of its use in the making of rope, twine,
veterinary medicines, and other products, marijuana's commercial
value was thought to outweigh any deleterious effects from its
abuse. However, as marijuana use became widespread in America,
concern about its use also spread. Due to the efforts of a
&quot;small but vocal group of crusaders,&quot; the States began
to pass legislation to prohibit all marijuana-related activity.
By 1931, &quot;all but two states West of the Mississippi and
several more in the East had enacted prohibitory legislation
making it a criminal offense to possess or use the drug.&quot;
The FBN initially minimized the dangers of marijuana use, and in
its 1932 annual report, it instead urged the States to adopt a
Uniform State Narcotics Law. Such a law was drafted in 1932, and
it included an optional marijuana provision. </p>

<p>By 1937 every state had prohibited marijuana use. However,
faced with continuing intensive lobbying efforts, the FBN did
become an &quot;ardent supporter&quot; of marijuana legislation,
which finally was embodied in the Marihuana Tax Act 1937. </p>

<p>The Marihuana Tax Act was nominally a revenue measure
patterned after the Harrison Narcotic Act. It required that any
person whose business related to marijuana to register and pay a
special tax. In addition, the transference of marijuana had to be
pursuant to a written order on a form issued by the Secretary of
the Treasury and the transferee was required to pay a tax of
$1.00/ounce if he had registered and $100.00/ounce if he had not.
Finally, the Act made the transferor liable for the transfer tax
if a transfer were made without an order form and without payment
of the tax by the transferee. </p>

<p>From the late 1930's through the 1950's, the FBN's enforcement
efforts were directed almost exclusively at disrupting the
illegal importation of drugs into this country and to making
cases against distributors and dealers. Indeed, in 1942 the FBN
recognized that it was necessary to eradicate crops in Mexico if
its interdiction efforts were to achieve greater success. In that
same year Congress enacted the Opium Poppy Control Act of 1942,
which, among other things, prohibited the domestic production of
the poppy without FBN permission. </p>

<p>During a great part of this period the FBN was handicapped to
some degree by a shortage of agents and inadequate budgets. In
the Spring of 1956, a Congressional Committee found that: </p>

<p>[FBN] is one of the few Federal agencies whose personnel and
funds have not been increased to reflect population growth and
greater responsibility. Over a period of 25 years, the Federal
narcotic laws have been enforced with a force of approximately
227 agents and an average budget of less than $2 million. This
restriction on manpower and operating funds has seriously
curtailed investigations of the illicit traffic in the United
States and of sources of supply in foreign countries. </p>

<p>Because of budget limitations, the present force of 250
Federal narcotic agents is 25 short of the number authorized by
the Congress. By way of comparison, New York City has
approximately 200 police officers assigned specifically to
narcotic enforcement. </p>

<p>These statistics suggest that, during this time, drug abuse
and trafficking were not the Federal priorities that they are
today. </p>

<p>Despite the handicaps that the FBN operated under during this
period, it nevertheless enjoyed a degree of success. According to
LCN informer Joseph Valachi, the tactics used by the FBN to
infiltrate and disrupt trafficking organizations caused some LCN
chieftains to rethink the advisability of their continued
participation in the drug trade. According to Valachi, Frank
Costello, then acting boss of the Luciano Family, ordered its
members to stop trafficking in drugs in 1948. One of the
principal reasons for the edict was explained as follows: </p>

<p>Much more important . . . was the dogged harassment of the
Bureau of Narcotics. The Cosa Nostra despised - and feared - [the
FBN] . . . . </p>

<p>The Narcotics Bureau, unlike the FBI, which tends to look down
its nose at it, does not depend on the informant system for much
of its intelligence but regularly engages its agents in dangerous
undercover work; they are, as a result, . . . highly motivated,
less disciplined, generally more daring and innovational,
occasionally corruptible. Above all else, the [FBN] was the first
to recognize the existence of an organization like the Cosa
Nostra, and no other arm of the law has put more of a crimp in
its operation. </p>

<p>Although continuing to warn of the dangers of drug use, the
FBN, especially during the earlier part of the period,
&quot;adopted a more moderate approach in its dealings with
Congress as well as the American people.&quot; The Bureau's
approach reflected the attitude of the American public, which
appeared to consider the drug problem to be restricted to small
groups at the periphery of society, with no great societal
impact. </p>

<p>In the 1950's the rather complacent attitude toward the drug
problem began to change. The first indication of greater concern
was reflected in the enactment of the Boggs Act on November 2,
1951, which generally increased the penalties for violations of
the narcotic and marijuana laws. The primary motivations for the
passage of the Boggs Act were the inadequacy of penalties under
the existing law as deterrents and an increase in drug addiction.
With respect to the former, Congress relied on statistics showing
that the rate of recidivism among drug violators had increased
substantially over a 15- year period of time; in 1935, 40 percent
of those convicted of narcotics violations had prior drug
convictions, while 63.6 percent of those convicted and sentenced
during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1950 were recidivists.
Congress concluded that drug addiction was increasing on the
basis of statistics showing that between 1946 and 1950 there had
been a 100 percent increase in the number of narcotic
laws-related arrests and that the average age of persons
committed to a Public Health Service Hospital had declined from
37.5 to 26.7 years, over a five year period. </p>

<p>Encouraged by the purported success of the Boggs Act, Congress
passed the Narcotic Control Act of 1956, which further increased
the penalties for drug violations. Among other things, this 1956
Act raised the permissive maximum sentences for violations of the
narcotic possession statutes; imposed new mandatory minimum
sentences and increased the permissive maximums for trafficking
violations; eliminated probation, suspension of service, or
parole for all cases except those involving a first offender
possessor; authorized FBN and Customs agents to carry firearms
and to execute and serve search and arrest warrants; made the
sale of heroin to individuals under 18 years of age a capital
offense, although the death penalty was not made mandatory but
could be imposed only if the jury specifically so directed; and
made the smuggling of marijuana a violation of the Narcotic Drugs
Import and Export Act. </p>

<p>The severe penalties imposed by the Narcotic Control Act of
1956 were adopted even though Congress found that, as a result of
the Boggs Act, &quot;narcotic addiction and the illicit narcotic
traffic [were] generally on the decline in the United
States.&quot; Because the stringent penalties imposed by the
Boggs Act were thought to be successful in decreasing drug
addiction, the 84th Congress concluded that the imposition of
even more severe penalties would &quot;be the strongest and most
effective deterrent to narcotic addiction and illicit drug
traffic.&quot; Finally, Congress was of the view in enacting the
Narcotic Control Act of 1956 that &quot;suppression of the
illicit drug traffic&quot; would be the most important
contribution that the Federal Government could make to the
successful and permanent rehabilitation of drug addicts. Congress
thus sought to reduce the demand for drugs through reducing their
supply. </p>

<p>Public concern over the problem of drug abuse, which had been
relatively dormant during the 1940's and 1950's, flared during
the 1960's. The intensification of the national concern resulted
in increasing pressure for Federal initiatives in the area. In
response to this development, a White House Conference on
Narcotics and Drug Abuse was convened in 1962, which resulted in
the establishment of the President's Advisory Commission on
Narcotics and Drug Abuse (Prettyman Commission) on January 15,
1963. </p>

<p>The Prettyman Commission's final report, submitted to
President Kennedy in November 1963, included 25 recommendations,
the substance of several of which were: </p>

<p>(1) Transfer the enforcement and investigative functions of
the FBN relating to illicit transactions in narcotic drugs and
marijuana from the Department of Treasury to the Department of
Justice; </p>

<p>(2) Transfer the responsibilities of the FBN relating to the
regulation of the legitimate traffic in narcotic drugs and
marijuana from the Department of the Treasury to the Department
of Health, Education and Welfare; </p>

<p>(3) Substantially increase the number of Federal agents
assigned to the investigation of the illicit importation of and
trafficking in narcotic drugs, marijuana, and dangerous drugs; </p>

<p>(4) Transfer the responsibility for investigating the illicit
traffic in dangerous drugs from the Department of Health,
Education and Welfare to the Department of Justice; and </p>

<p>(5) Strictly control, by Federal statute, all non-narcotic
drugs capable of producing serious psychotoxic effects when
abused. </p>

<p>Within 18 months of the issuance of the Commission's final
report, Congress adopted the recommendation regarding the
diversion of &quot;dangerous drugs&quot; from legal channels. The
resulting Drug Abuse Control Amendments of 1965 mandated, among
other things, record-keeping and inspection requirements for
depressant and stimulant drugs, and specifically for barbiturates
and amphetamines, &quot;throughout the chain of distribution,
from the basic manufacturer to (but not including) the ultimate
consumer.&quot; The Drug Abuse Control Amendments of 1965 were
passed because of perceived serious problems associated with the
diversion of depressant and stimulant drugs from licit channels: </p>

<p>[T]estimony showed that over 9 billion barbiturate and
amphetamine tablets are produced annually in the United States.
It is estimated that over 50 percent, or 4 1/2 billion tablets,
are distributed through illicit channels. The human toll of drug
abuse cannot be measured for it affects not only the abuser but
his family and the community around him. Drug abuse is closely
bound up with juvenile delinquency. It also contributes to the
rising crime rate in the United States. </p>

<p>To carry out the new enforcement obligations imposed by the
Drug Abuse Control Amendments of 1965 another agency was created;
a Bureau of Drug Abuse Control (BDAC) was established within the
Department's Food and Drug Administration. The Bureau of Customs,
however, retained responsibility for the enforcement of laws
relating to the importing and exporting of depressant and
stimulants drugs. With the establishment of the BDAC on February
1, 1966, the Department of the Treasury's virtual monopoly of the
enforcement of Federal drug laws ended. </p>

<p>Within 16 months of the enactment of the Drug Abuse Control
Amendments of 1965 Congress passed an enlightened piece of
legislation: The Narcotic Addict Rehabilitation Act of 1966. This
Act did many things, including: authorizing a district court to
order the civil commitment of an individual, who was an addict,
who had been charged with certain offenses against the United
States, and who elected to do so, to the Surgeon General for
treatment of his addiction and rehabilitation, in lieu of
prosecution; requiring a district court to commit an individual
who had been convicted of certain offenses against the United
States and who was an addict to the custody of the Attorney
General for treatment and rehabilitation; permitting any narcotic
addict to file a petition with a United States Attorney
requesting that he be admitted to a Public Health Service
hospital for treatment and rehabilitation; and authorizing the
Surgeon General to establish rehabilitation and
post-hospitalization care programs for narcotic addicts and to
provide financial assistance to the States to establish similar
programs. </p>

<p>As the House Committee on Judiciary, one of the Congressional
committees which reported on the proposed bill, observed, the
Narcotic Addict Rehabilitation Act of 1966: </p>

<p>. . . mark[e]d a fundamental reorientation toward the problem
of narcotics addiction. The Attorney General in his testimony
before the Committee stated that for too long the law had
stressed punitive solutions and neglected medical and
rehabilitative measures. </p>

<p>The 1966 Act embodied a proposition that had tended to be
overlooked in the past: successful treatment and permanent
rehabilitation of drug users, i.e., reduction of demand for
drugs, must be an essential component of Federal law enforcement
efforts. </p>

<p>A detailed evaluation of the Federal drug strategy that was
released in 1979 accurately summarized what the Federal approach
had been prior to the late 1960's: </p>

<p>Early efforts to deal with the problem primarily focused on
reducing the supply of drugs, first through taxation, then by
prohibition and strict legal control. The basic assumption . . .
was that reducing supply and availability of drugs would lead to
reduction in their use by encouraging drug-dependent individuals
to detoxify, and by keeping drugs out of the hands of users. </p>

<p>By the end of the 1950's there was a general agreement on the
part of both the public and legislators that the Federal policy
of strict supply reduction by itself was not enough. During the
1960's and early 1970's, as drug abuse increased and spread to
new markets, the almost exclusive emphasis on supply reduction
and stiff penalties was challenged with growing frequency,
leading to increased research and experimentation with treatment
for drug abusers. </p>

<p>Beginning in 1968, in response to rising . . . concern . . .,
a variety of changes occurred in an attempt to curtail drug
abuse. </p>

<p>Despite the work of the Prettyman Commission and the enactment
of the Drug Abuse Control Amendments of 1965, public agitation
concerning crime in general, and drug abuse in particular,
intensified. In response, President Lyndon B. Johnson established
the President's Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration
of Justice (Katzenbach Commission) in 1966 to undertake a
&quot;comprehensive study of the nation's crime problem and to
provid[e] recommendations to coordinate its eradication on all
fronts.&quot; The Katzenbach Commission issued a report in 1967,
which included a chapter on drug abuse. The substance of several
of the Katzenbach Commission's recommendations addressed both the
demand and supply of drugs: </p>

<p>(1) Substantially increase the enforcement staffs of FBN and
the Bureau of Customs; </p>

<p>(2) Permit courts and correctional authorities to deal
flexibly with violators of the drug laws; </p>

<p>(3) Undertake research to develop a sound and effective
framework of regulatory and criminal laws relating to dangerous
drugs; and </p>

<p>(4) The National Institute of Mental Health should develop a
core of educational and informational materials relating to
drugs. </p>

<p>Drawing on the recommendations of the Prettyman Commission,
President Johnson sent a reorganization plan restructuring the
Federal drug law enforcement effort to Congress for its
consideration on February 7, 1968. In terms that have been
repeated often since that time, President Johnson explained the
reason for the proposed consolidation of drug enforcement
responsibilities: </p>

<p>Today, Federal investigation and enforcement of our narcotics
laws are fragmented. </p>

<p>* * * </p>

<p>Neither [the FBN nor the BADC] is in the agency which is
primarily concerned with Federal law enforcement - the Department
of Justice. </p>

<p>This separation of responsibilities . . . has complicated and
hindered our response to a national menace. </p>

<p>Among the most significant provisions of the plan, which
became effective on April 7, 1968, were the following: the
Department of Justice was given a major responsibility for the
enforcement of the Federal drug laws for the first time in
history by the creation within it of a Bureau of Narcotics and
Dangerous Drugs (BNDD); the FBN was abolished, and its drug
enforcement duties and responsibilities were shifted to BNDD; and
BDAC was also abolished, and its drug enforcement duties and
responsibilities were transferred to the Department of Justice. </p>

<p>The 1968 reorganization did not significantly affect the
revenue collection functions exercised by IRS under the Harrison
and Marijuana Tax Acts or the responsibility of the Bureau of
Customs for interdicting the smuggling of narcotics and
marijuana. The Plan that was intended to eliminate fragmentation
in Federal drug law enforcement thus did not eliminate it
entirely. </p>

<p>Although neither House of Congress blocked the 1968
reorganization plan, criticism of it did develop. While in
agreement that merger of the FBN and BDAC would eliminate
friction and duplication of effort, Congressional opponents
expressed skepticism that law enforcement relating to drugs and
organized crime would be in any way improved by transferring the
merged entity to the Department of Justice. Because
Administration spokesmen had acknowledged that BDAC and the FBN
had been effective law enforcement agencies, the opponents of the
plan recommended that the merged entity should instead be located
within the Department of the Treasury, where coordination with
IRS and Customs, both of which had drug law enforcement
responsibilities, could be better assured. That the BNDD was
apparently not to be placed within the FBI was one factor leading
the dissenters to conclude that &quot;greater overall efficiency
in crime enforcement&quot; would not be achieved by the placement
of the merged entity into Justice. </p>

<p>Federal Drug Law Enforcement: From Implementation of the 1968
Reorganization Plan to October 27, 1970. </p>

<p>Two major issues during the 1968 Presidential campaign were
crime and drugs. Shortly after his inauguration, President
Richard M. Nixon declared war on both and formed Task Force One
in the spring of 1969 to &quot;design programs that would have an
immediate effect on the importation of heroin and other illegal
drugs.&quot; Task Force One developed and implemented Operation
Intercept, the &quot;first major interagency attempt at border
interdiction,&quot; which involved more than 2,000 Customs, INS
Border Patrol, and BNDD agents. Because the amount of illegal
drugs seized as a result of Operation Intercept was
disappointingly small and because the venture seriously strained
relations between Mexico and the United States, Justice
Department officials concluded that successful interdiction
programs required the cooperation of source countries. As a
result, in the fall of 1969, Operation Intercept was transformed
into Operation Cooperation, which in part provided U.S. financial
aid to the Mexican Government to purchase aircraft and to train
agents to interdict the flow of drugs before they reached the
United States borders. </p>

<p>The Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of
1970 </p>

<p>The year 1970 was an important one in the history of this
Nation's war against drug trafficking and drug abuse. In February
of that year, President Nixon clarified the responsibilities of
the various Federal agencies involved in the effort against drug
trafficking by issuing a directive announcing that BNDD
&quot;controls all investigations involving violations of the
laws of the United States relating to narcotics, marijuana and
dangerous drugs, both within the United States and beyond its
borders. Several months later, the President approved guidelines,
developed by the Attorney General and the Secretary of the
Treasury, which increased the investigatory responsibility of
Customs at ports and borders. However, the most significant event
in 1970 was the enactment of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse
Prevention and Control Act of 1970 (1970 Comprehensive Act). </p>

<p>As of 1970, numerous Federal statutes dealt with various
facets of the Nation's drug trafficking and abuse problems. These
laws overlapped, were sometimes inconsistent, and required more
than a dozen Federal agencies to enforce them. In response, the
1970 Comprehensive Act was passed to collect and conform
&quot;diverse laws in one piece of legislation based upon new
scientific information, the restructured Federal law enforcement
efforts under Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1968, and greater
information concerning the scope of the problem.&quot; </p>

<p>The 1970 Act comprised four titles: Title I authorized the
Department of Health, Education, and Welfare to increase its
efforts in drug rehabilitation, drug treatment and the prevention
of drug abuse. Specifically, Title I authorized the appropriation
of funds for drug abuse prevention and education programs and for
special project grants to programs designed to treat and
rehabilitate narcotic addicts or drug dependent persons. As a
result of these steps, Congress provided for a &quot;greatly
increased Federal effort in the fields of prevention and
rehabilitation&quot; and made the National Institute of Mental
Health the agency primarily responsible for drug education and
prevention activities in the Federal government. </p>

<p>Title II of the 1970 Act, the &quot;Controlled Substances
Act,&quot; along with Title III, comprehensively addressed the
law enforcement aspects of the attack on drug abuse. Among other
things, Title II established five schedules into which controlled
substances were and could be placed, required the registration
of, and record-keeping by, manufacturers, distributors and
dispensers of controlled substances, imposed penalties for
violations of the Act, established a Commission on Marihuana and
Drug Abuse, and authorized BNDD to add 300 agents to its staff
during FY 1971. </p>

<p>Finally, Title III, the Controlled Substances Import and
Export Act, governed the importation and exportation of
controlled substances. The Attorney General was given the
responsibility for maintaining the integrity of the import/export
registration system that the Act created. </p>

<p>Although primarily an effort to consolidate the myriad of laws
dealing with drug trafficking and abuse that had been adopted
over the years, Congress's authority for enacting the 1970 Act
was predicated upon its interstate commerce power and not, as
with previous narcotics laws, on the constitutional power to tax.
This shift had enormous implications for the way that the Federal
government would and did approach drug enforcement in the future:
</p>

<p>[The Controlled Substances Act] set the stage for an
innovation in Federal drug enforcement techniques. That
innovation was assigning large numbers of Federal narcotics
agents to work in local communities. No longer was it necessary
to demonstrate interstate traffic to justify Federal
participation in combating illegal drug use. </p>

<p>Constitutional challenges to the 1970 Act that were predicated
upon the intrastate nature of the conduct prosecuted were
rejected. </p>

<p>Federal Drug Abuse Policy: 1970-1980 </p>

<p>The decade of the 1970's was an extremely significant one for
the development of Federal drug abuse policy in terms of new
laws, organizational and operational reforms, and a growing
recognition that the reduction of the demand for drugs must be
given a greater emphasis. On the debit side the extent of the
Nation's drug abuse problem at the end of 1980 was as great as,
if not greater than, the problem in 1970. To some extent, the
situation in 1980 was attributable to the continuing and
unresolved debate concerning the appropriate Federal role in the
national struggle against drug abuse and trafficking. </p>

<p>New legislative initiatives, organizations, and operational
reforms relating to the Nation's drug abuse problem were adopted
and implemented within a relatively short period after the
enactment of the 1970 Comprehensive Act. One of the most
important and innovative of these reforms was the establishment,
by executive order, of the Special Action Office for Drug Abuse
Prevention (SAODAP) within the Executive Office of the President
on June 17, 1971. The President made the Director of SAODAP his
special representative with respect to all Federal drug abuse
training, education, rehabilitation, research, treatment, and
prevention programs and activities (exclusive of law enforcement
activities and legal proceedings). In this capacity, the SAODAP
Director's duties included prescribing &quot;policies,
guidelines, standards, and criteria for the maximum achievement
of the goals and objectives&quot; of Federal demand reduction
programs and coordinating and evaluating all Federal drug abuse
programs. </p>

<p>President Nixon did not neglect the supply reduction component
of the Federal drug policy. Presidential initiatives in this area
in 1971 included the establishment of the Cabinet Committee on
International Narcotics Control (CCINC) and of the Narcotics
Traffickers Program (NTP) within IRS. The CCINC, chaired by the
Secretary of State, was given the responsibility for
&quot;developing a strategy to check the illegal flow of
narcotics to the United States and coordinating the efforts
undertaken abroad by involved Federal departments and agencies to
implement that strategy.&quot; </p>

<p>The NTP was designed to function as a mechanism for disrupting
drug trafficking by having the IRS intensively investigate
top-echelon drug dealers. The IRS effectively ended the NTP
sometime in 1975, both because it had a relatively low revenue
yield and because IRS officials felt uncomfortable in operating a
program whose primary objective was not tax-related. </p>

<p>On January 28, 1972, President Nixon took another step,
designed to improve the Federal government's drug law enforcement
efforts by establishing an Office for Drug Abuse Law Enforcement
(ODALE) within the Department of Justice. This office was to be
headed by a Director who would be a Special Assistant Attorney
General and who would serve as a Special Consultant to the
President concerning drug law enforcement. In this role the ODALE
Director was responsible for advising the President on improving
the effectiveness of Federal drug enforcement and on assisting
the States and local governments in strengthening their own drug
law enforcement. The Director was also required to develop and
implement a &quot;concentrated program&quot; for enforcing
Federal laws concerning drug abuse prevention and for cooperating
with State and local governments in the enforcement of their drug
abuse laws. Finally, to ensure that all steps permitted by law
were taken by Federal, State and local governments and by the
private sector to prevent drug abuse, the Director of ODALE was
instructed to consult regularly with the SAODAP Director. With
the establishment of ODALE and SAODAP, and the presidential
instruction that their Directors consult, cooperate, and
coordinate, a mechanism was created within the Federal Government
that, at least theoretically, could have integrated Federal
strategies to reduce drug supply and demand to achieve maximum
results. </p>

<p>That ODALE was created in early 1972, so relatively soon after
the implementation of the 1968 reorganization plan, bespoke a
lack of confidence in the structure and operation of the drug law
enforcement system created by that plan. Indeed, ODALE was
established because of the &quot;Administration's concern that
BNDD and Customs could not act with the swiftness and precision
that a single agency vested with authority and power could.&quot;
In performing its duties and responsibilities ODALE &quot;was
empowered to take the lead in the Administration's 'war on
heroin,' with a particular emphasis on street-level
trafficking.&quot; </p>

<p>Several months after the creation of ODALE, another unit, the
Office of National Narcotic Intelligence (ONNI), was established
within the Department of Justice to function as a Clearinghouse
Of information that would be useful in the Administration's
campaign against drug trafficking. The Director of ONNI was
instructed to collect and provide narcotics intelligence to any
Federal, State, or local official determined to have a
&quot;legitimate official need&quot; for the intelligence. The
ONNI Director was also instructed to cooperate with the Director
of ODALE to assist the latter in insuring that all feasible steps
were taken to prevent drug abuse in the Nation. Although its
mandate did not include the independent development of narcotics
intelligence, the establishment of ONNI was the first concrete
recognition by officials at the highest levels of the Federal
government of the crucial role that intelligence had to play in
supply reduction strategies. </p>

<p>Congress eventually responded positively to President Nixon's
request that it enact legislation confirming his creation of
SAODAP by passing the Drug Abuse Office and Treatment Act of 1972
(1972 Drug Abuse Office Act). This legislation was an important
event in the history of Federal drug abuse policy: </p>

<p>With the enactment of the [Act] Federal policy clearly called
for a balanced response to the problem of drug abuse by adding a
vigorous prevention and treatment component to the existing law
enforcement effort. </p>

<p>Although commitments to the &quot;balanced response&quot;
enshrined in the 1972 Drug Abuse office Act have been proclaimed
repeatedly ever since, they have not generally been translated
into action, as measured by budget authorizations and
expenditures. </p>

<p>Congress was persuaded to enact the 1972 Drug Abuse Office Act
because the witnesses who testified before its committees were
&quot;unanimously agreed that drug abuse in America had reached
epidemic proportions.&quot; Most of the witnesses were
&quot;generally agreed that greater emphasis on the so-called
demand side of the problem is required, that is, on treatment,
rehabilitation, research, education and training.&quot; Congress
also found that the Federal government's activities with respect
to the &quot;demand side of the drug abuse field have been
carried on by at least nine different agencies and
departments&quot; and that the legislation under consideration
was needed to &quot;provide for and insure a central
comprehensive coordination of the federal effort.&quot; In
passing the Act, Congress concluded that the &quot;emphasis must,
indeed, be changed [to strategies to reduce demand] if there is
to be meaningful progress in the effort against drug abuse.&quot;
</p>

<p>The 1972 Drug Abuse Office Act did many things, including
establishing SAODAP in the Executive Office of the President;
making the Director of SAODAP responsible for, among other
things, providing overall planning and policy, and establishing
objectives and priorities, for all federal drug abuse prevention
functions, making recommendations to the President concerning any
Federal drug traffic prevention function, making findings and
recommendations to the President concerning the resolution of
conflicts involving drug abuse prevention or drug traffic
prevention functions, and coordinating Federal drug abuse
prevention functions with those of the State and local
governments; directing the President to require development of a
comprehensive, coordinated long-term Federal strategy for all
drug abuse and drug traffic prevention functions; directing the
Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to make grants to
States submitting plans for establishing, conducting and
coordinating projects for the development of more effective drug
abuse prevention functions and to make special project grants to,
and contracts with, public and private entities and individuals
to develop drug abuse prevention programs; and establishing a
National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) to administer the
programs of the Secretary of HEW relating to drug abuse
prevention functions. </p>

<p>The 1972 Drug Abuse Office Act was necessary and useful
legislation, but it was based on the mistaken premise that the
nation's drug abuse problem could be dealt with in a relatively
short period of time: </p>

<p>[I]t is the policy of the United States and the purpose of
this Act to focus the comprehensive resources of the Federal
Government and bring them to bear on drug abuse with the
immediate objective of significantly reducing the incidence of
drug abuse in the United States within the shortest possible
period of time . . . . </p>

<p>Consistent with this premise, Congress provided that SAODAP
was to be abolished on June 30, 1975. </p>

<p>There appears to have been an expectation at the time that the
1972 Drug Abuse office Act became effective that NIDA would
assume many of the programmatic functions of SAODAP on or before
June 30, 1975, after the war against drug abuse had been won and
only &quot;mopping-up&quot; operations remained. This expectation
no doubt was encouraged by statements made subsequent to the
passage of the 1972 Act, such as that of President Nixon in
September of 1973 that &quot;[w]e have turned the corner on drug
addiction in the United States.&quot; As the historical record
demonstrates, the expectation of quick success was unrealistic
because of the nature of the drug problem. </p>

<p>The 1972 Drug Abuse Office Act reflected the realization that
an exclusive reliance on strategies to reduce supply will fail to
achieve the ultimate objective. Such an approach disregards the
fundamental economic principle, that where a demand for a service
or commodity exists, some entrepreneur, for the right price, will
attempt to supply it. There is an optimal mix of approaches to
reduce demand and supply that will obtain maximum results and
thus achieve the goal of that policy, i.e., the elimination of
drug abuse. The Federal government necessarily has a paramount
and continuing role in that policy, in terms of providing
leadership, resources, and support to the other participants.
Experience immediately following the enactment of the 1972 Drug
Abuse Office Act demonstrates that although the Nation's drug
abuse problem may never be eliminated, it can be reduced
substantially if a long-term commitment of sufficient resources
is made and unreasonable impatience for results is checked. </p>

<p>Despite the comprehensive restructuring of the Federal
narcotics laws that had occurred in 1970, related legislative
initiatives, and the innovations in Federal drug law enforcement
represented by ODALE and ONNI, the Nixon Administration concluded
that Federal drug law enforcement continued to be hampered by
interagency rivalries and jurisdictional overlaps and disputes.
In response, another major restructuring of the Federal drug law
enforcement machinery was announced on March 28, 1973. The Nixon
Administration trumpeted the 1973 reorganization plan, which was
implemented on July 1, 1973, as doing for the supply side of the
drug abuse problem what the 1972 Drug Abuse Office Act had done
for the demand side: create an organization with the necessary
resources, breadth, and leadership capacity to act decisively. </p>

<p>The Federal drug law enforcement structure in March of 1973
was complex, as reflected in Appendix C, with no single
individual or agency responsible for supervision of the overall
effort. The 1973 reorganization plan was designed to overcome
perceived deficiencies in existing law enforcement. </p>

<p>The 1973 reorganization plan was motivated primarily by the
beliefs of Administration officials that the aggregation of
Federal drug law enforcement activities had &quot;serious
operational and organizational shortcomings&quot; and that
&quot;enforcement work could benefit significantly . . . from
consolidation of our anti-drug forces under a single unified
command.&quot; The most important innovation adopted by the plan
was the creation of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA)
within the Department of Justice as the &quot;single,
comprehensive Federal agency within the Department of Justice to
lead the war against illicit drug traffic.&quot; The DEA, to be
headed by an Administrator who would report directly to the
Attorney General, was to be responsible for the anti-drug
functions, and would absorb the associated manpower and budgets
of BNDD, ODALE, and ONNI and those of the Bureau of Customs with
respect to drug investigations and intelligence. The plan also
provided that drug law enforcement research that had been
hitherto funded by the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration
would be transferred to DEA. </p>

<p>While the 1973 reorganization plan reaffirmed the jurisdiction
of the Bureau of Customs to conduct investigative, intelligence,
and law enforcement functions relating to the suppression of drug
trafficking at ports of entry and borders, it prohibited Customs
from exercising those functions, as it had been previously
authorized to do, at locations away from ports of entry or
borders. In addition, drugs, evidence, and persons seized by
customs agents at ports of entry or borders were to be turned
over to representatives of the Attorney General. The plan
explicitly provided that the Department of Justice, in addition
to Customs, could perform law enforcement functions, including
those relating to illicit drug trafficking, at the Nation's ports
of entry and borders. Finally, the plan required the Attorney
General to assure the maximum cooperation between and among DEA,
the FBI, and other units of the Justice Department to achieve
coordination of all of his drug law enforcement functions. </p>

<p>Once established, DEA played an &quot;increasingly crucial
role in the coordination of Federal drug law enforcement; and
during the 1970's a number of interagency efforts were
launched.&quot; Among the coordination efforts undertaken by DEA
was the development of mechanisms to provide timely and accurate
narcotics intelligence to drug law enforcement personnel at the
Federal, State and local levels. Steps taken by DEA in this area
included the establishment of: </p>

<p>(1) An Office of Intelligence at DEA headquarters which,
organizationally, was at the same level as its Office of
Enforcement; </p>

<p>(2) Regional Intelligence Units (RIUs) in each of the DEA
regions; </p>

<p>(3) The El Paso Intelligence Center (EPIC) in 1974 as a border
intelligence unit, which soon grew into a
&quot;twenty-four-hour-a-day intelligence center, with worldwide
capabilities to collect, process, and disseminate information
concerning illicit drug trafficking as the smuggling of aliens
and weapons; EPIC is staffed by personnel from DFA, INS, Customs,
the Coast Guard, BATF, FAA, the U.S. Marshals Service, FBI and
IRS; </p>

<p>(4) The Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs Information System
(NADDIS) and the System to Retrieve Information from Drug
Evidence (STRIDE) to provide access to numerous investigative
records of PEA and other Federal, State and local drug
enforcement records; </p>

<p>(5) In April of 1978, the National Narcotics Intelligence
Consumers Committee (NNICC), chaired by the DEA Deputy Assistant
Administrator for Intelligence and including representatives from
the Departments of Defense, Treasury and State, and their
component agencies in the field, including Customs, the Coast
Guard, FBI, INS, IRS, and NIDA to coordinate the collection,
analysis, dissemination and evaluation of drug-related
intelligence, both foreign and domestic, and to publish annually
a &quot;National Intelligence Estimate on the Supply of Drugs to
the U.S. Illicit Market from Foreign and Domestic Sources.&quot; </p>

<p>In addition to trying to improve the intelligence gathering
and dissemination functions of Federal drug law enforcement, PEA
attempted to improve the task force concept in drug law
enforcement which it had inherited from ODALE. In 1974 DEA
adopted the Central Tactical Units (CENTAC) program to focus
enforcement resources on conspiracy investigations of high-level
drug trafficking targets. Unfettered by normal DEA regional
operations, centrally administered, specially funded, staffed by
personnel from DEA, IRS, Customs, and State and local agencies,
and charged with pursuing conspiracy cases under the Continuing
Criminal Enterprise (CCE) and RICO statutes, the CENTAC program
did produce relatively high arrest and conviction rates of high
level traffickers, and accounted for 12 percent of DEA arrests
from 1976 to 1979 while using less than three percent of DEA
personnel. Although criticizing the CENTAC Program for not
exploiting the Federal forfeiture statutes to seize the assets of
convicted traffickers, the General Accounting office (GAO)
nevertheless concluded that: </p>

<p>Given the success of the Central Tactical units and the need
for more multi-regional conspiracy investigations, the expansion
of the [CENTAC] program is warranted. </p>

<p>GAO recommended expansion of the CENTAC program despite an
earlier conclusion that the CENTAC efforts had not
&quot;achieve[d] the overall objective - complete immobilization
of the targeted trafficking organizations.&quot; The 1980 GAO
report also conflicted with: </p>

<p>DEA officials who said the current size of the CENTAC program
is optimum given existing enforcement resources, required
commitments, and their preference for regionally controlled
investigations . . . . </p>

<p>Another effort at interagency operational cooperation during
the decade of the 1970's was the creation of three FBI-DEA forces
in Chicago, New York, and Los Angeles to &quot;test the
feasibility of joint operations.&quot; These task forces were
designed to combine the FBI's organized crime and conspiracy
cases expertise with DEA's experience in narcotics
investigations. This effort was probably doomed from the start
because, although each agency was supposed to coordinate with the
other, each used its own investigative techniques, personnel, and
information sources and each maintained jurisdictional autonomy.
After two years, the program was in effect disbanded, and
evaluations by GAO and others attributed the failure to
disagreements over investigative techniques and to restrictions
on case selection. </p>

<p>The creation of DEA by the 1973 reorganization plan and DEA's
subsequent development of new supply reduction approaches were
not the only steps undertaken and designed during the 1970's to
respond to what many had come to view as the almost intractable
national drug problem. For example, Congress passed the Narcotic
Addict Treatment Act of 1974, which amended the 1970 Controlled
Substances Act to require annual registration by practitioners
dispensing narcotic drugs, including methadone, for maintenance
or detoxification purposes. This legislation, which imposed
standards for the legal dispensing of drugs, was deemed necessary
because of the increased diversion of methadone for illegal sale
and use. </p>

<p>That year also saw the passage of the Alcohol and Drug Abuse
Education Act Amendments of 1974, which extended the grant and
contract authorities of the Drug Abuse Education Act of 1970 for
three years and authorized the expenditure of $90 million over
those three years. The Act placed greater emphasis on the need
for prevention and early intervention programs, recognizing the
crucial role of family, peer group, school, church and other
community institutions in influencing young people's behavior. </p>

<p>In enacting the 1974 Alcohol and Drug Abuse Education Act
Amendments, Congress noted that most of the previously adopted
Federal programs to reduce demand had &quot;inevitably been
directed primarily toward the person who is already in serious
trouble with alcohol and/or drugs,&quot; but that the focus of
the Drug Abuse Education Act of 1970 had been different in that
it was directed to those who had not yet experimented with drugs
or to those who had just begun to do so. In passing the 1974
amendments Congress applauded the focus on prevention,
reaffirming the philosophy that had suffused the 1970 Education
Act: </p>

<p>[R]eal progress in the struggle against alcohol and drug abuse
will require an intensified effort to reach that far more
numerous group, those millions of young people who may be tempted
to experiment with dangerous drugs or who may have already done
so. </p>

<p>Although committed to the continuation of Federal support for
local drug education programs, Congress was nevertheless critical
of those educational programs that were based upon information
that was incomplete, erroneous, or designed to frighten, and
those based on accurate information that had the tendency to
arouse interest in drugs and to lead to experimentation, Before
passing the 1974 Amendments Congress received assurances from the
Office of Education within the Department of HEW that it would
make every effort to support only those programs which would
&quot;incorporate factual material about drugs into programs
which focus on the causes of drug use and emphasize the
development of appropriate attitudes and values,&quot; rather
than merely inform and arouse interest. </p>

<p>The Nixon Administration opposed passage of the bill that
eventually became the Alcohol and Drug Abuse Education Act
Amendments of 1974 because it believed that &quot;alcohol and
drug abuse education [should] be included among the special
projects to be funded under other education legislation and that
alcoholism and drug abuse formula grant funds to the states
[should] be considered the major source of funds for local
alcohol and drug abuse education programs.&quot; Congress
disagreed with the Administration's position concerning
categorical legislation relating to prevention and early
intervention educational programs, stating that: </p>

<p>Failure to renew a clear legislative mandate to the Office of
Education would destroy the identity of the program at both the
Federal and the State level and would cast the alcohol and drug
education programs in the role of supplicants to those agencies
whose primary concern is not education and who are already
besieged by the demands of treatment programs. </p>

<p>The ultimate result would be either the disappearance of
community drug and alcohol education programs or a reversion to
some of the futile and dangerous efforts of the past. . . </p>

<p>As noted earlier, the 1972 Drug Abuse Office Act provided that
SAODAP would be abolished on June 30, 1975, with no assignment of
its policy-making and coordinative functions to any other Federal
agency. On March 19, 1976, however, legislation was approved that
in effect continued SAODAP, but under the slightly different name
of &quot;Office of Drug Abuse Policy&quot; (ODAP). Congress
created ODAP because: </p>

<p>[T]here is current evidence that whatever improvement in the
problem occurred in 1973 was temporary and that the present
problem is at least as great as at the time the original act was
passed. </p>

<p>In approving the continuation of an executive level drug
advisor, Congress found that &quot;drug abuse was not a crisis
which could be rapidly solved but rather a continuing problem
calling for a continued Federal responsibility.&quot; Congress
also concluded that Federal expenditures for drug abuse
prevention efforts had peaked in 1974 and then declined, despite
continuing serious problems, due to, among other things, the
anticipated end of SAODAP: </p>

<p>It would also appear that the existence of a high-level office
in the executive branch is to some extent correlated with the
fiscal emphasis provided to drug abuse prevention efforts. </p>

<p>Congress was also somewhat concerned that &quot;unless some
active direction is taken at some high level it is probable that
in the very near future funding for drug law enforcement will
again overbalance funding for drug abuse prevention.&quot; </p>

<p>In creating ODAP Congress required its Director to make
recommendations to the President regarding the policies and
priorities for, and objectives of, all Federal &quot;drug abuse
functions,&quot; a term which was defined to encompass both drug
abuse prevention and drug traffic prevention functions, and to
coordinate the performance of such functions by Federal
departments and agencies. This was a significant expansion of the
authority of ODAP's predecessor, SAODAP. </p>

<p>Despite the Ford Administration's opposition to the
continuation of an executive-level office relating to drug abuse
prevention, President Ford did not veto the 1976 amendment
creating ODAP. However, President Ford did not staff ODAP, even
though a specific line-item authorization had been made for it.
DAP did not come into being until President Carter issued a
memorandum initiating the Office on March 14, 1977. Less than two
months after the Senate confirmation of the ODAP Director,
President Carter submitted a reorganization plan restructuring
the Executive Office of the President to Congress on July 15,
1977. </p>

<p>The 1977 reorganization plan altered the structure of the
Executive Office of the President, which at the time consisted of
the immediate White House Office, the Vice President's Office,
OMB, and 14 other agencies, including ODAP and the Domestic
Council. As proposed, the plan, among other things, abolished the
Domestic Council and ODAP and redesignated the Domestic Council
Staff as the Domestic Policy Staff. The functions of ODAP and its
Director would be transferred to the President who could then
delegate such functions. </p>

<p>Several members of Congress, recalling that it was the need
for a high-level policy and coordinating office to oversee the
activities of more than 20 Federal agencies with significant drug
abuse responsibilities that had given birth to the SAODAP/ODAP
program, expressed grave concern about the abolishment of ODAP.
President Carter assured them that the ODAP's functions would be
carried on within the Executive office of the President and that
the Domestic Policy Staff, with several of its staff members
assigned exclusively to drug abuse issues, would handle ODAP's
policy-making and coordinative functions. With Congressional
acquiescence, the 1977 Reorganization became effective on March
26, 1978, at which time a core group of ODAP staff was
transferred to the Domestic Policy Staff. </p>

<p>Although Congress did not block the provisions of the 1977
reorganization plan, members of Congress nevertheless remained
unsure whether drug abuse policy-making and coordinative
functions could be or would be adequately performed by the
Domestic Policy Staff. This uncertainty was reflected in the Drug
Abuse Prevention and Treatment Amendments of 1978, which extended
the authorization for NIDA programs for only one year, instead of
the previous multi-year reauthorizations, so that it could
evaluate the system created by the 1977 reorganization plan after
a relatively brief but adequate period of time. </p>

<p>The Congressional evaluation of the operations of the drug
abuse policy and coordinating system in the Executive Office of
the President was embodied the next year in the Drug Abuse
Prevention, Treatment and Rehabilitation Amendments of 1979.
During the consideration of this legislation, President Carter
assigned the Associate Director for Drug Policy of the Domestic
Policy Staff the responsibility for assisting the President in
performing the functions of ODAP, which had been transferred to
the President by the 1977 reorganization plan. President Carter
took this step because of Congressional concern that: </p>

<p>[T]he continued coordination of drug abuse policy, required by
the 1972 Act and its subsequent amendments, became dependent upon
the continued interest . . . of the President and other
individuals within the Executive Branch, rather than being
clearly structured by statute as had been the case prior to the
implementation of the Reorganization Plan. </p>

<p>Because of the steps taken by the Carter Administration
including the revitalization of the Strategy Council, Congress
responded by legislating what the 1977 reorganization plan had
done. </p>

<p>In addition to giving its imprimatur to the 1977
reorganization plan, the 1979 legislation made authorizations for
NIDA's state formula grants and special grant and contract
programs for drug education and prevention through September 30,
1981. It did so because it found that the &quot;growing extent of
drug abuse indicates an urgent need for prevention and
intervention programs designed to reach the general
population.&quot; In providing for a two-year reauthorization for
NIDA programs and activities, Congress rejected the Carter
Administration's proposal that state formula grants for drug
abuse be consolidated with those for alcoholism and mental health
because: </p>

<p>There is considerable history to suggest that earmarked
funding for categorical programs should remain separate at the
State level as well as at the national level. Within the
traditional health care delivery system, the drug and alcohol
client has not fared well. To force these systems to compete
again is to seriously jeopardize the major strides which have
been made . . . . The Committee insists that a categorical
emphasis on drug abuse must be maintained at all levels of
government. A loss of direct program emphasis would severely harm
the state focus on combatting drug abuse, and could seriously
endanger the Nation's battle against drug abuse. </p>

<p>The decade of the 1970's was an important one in the evolution
of the Federal drug abuse effort. It began with a comprehensive
restructuring of Federal laws relating to drugs and included a
major reorganization of Federal drug law enforcement agencies in
a effort to reduce interagency rivalries and to promote
efficiency and leadership in the fight against drug trafficking.
Equally important was the recognition that strategies to reduce
demand must be an essential component of the overall drug abuse
policy and that the nation's drug abuse problem could not be
regarded as a crisis susceptible to quick resolution. In
addition, new laws were passed to respond to particular aspects
of the drug problem, and new enforcement approaches were tried in
an effort to disrupt drug trafficking more effectively. </p>

<p>On a less positive note, disagreements over certain
fundamental issues remained unresolved at the end of the 1970's.
Among these were the role of the Federal Government in drug
policy and the appropriate balance between strategies to reduce
demand and supply. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, despite
legislation, massive reorganizations, new enforcement techniques,
and necessary attitudinal changes, the problems of drug abuse and
trafficking continued at high levels at the end of the decade. </p>

<h1>America's Habit </h1>

<h2>Drug Abuse, Drug Trafficking, &amp; Organized Crime </h2>

<p><b>President's Commission on Organized Crime, 1986 </b></p>

<hr>

<h2>Chapter IV </h2>

<h2>Part 2: Federal Drug Abuse Policy: 1981-Present </h2>

<p>Early in his administration President Ronald Reagan
acknowledged that drug abuse was &quot;one of the gravest
problems facing us&quot; as a Nation. The Reagan Administration
has taken many steps designed to improve the effectiveness of the
U.S. overall drug abuse policy. </p>

<p>Reorganization/Coordination </p>

<p>On January 21, 1982, in a major policy shift, the FBI was
given concurrent jurisdiction with DEA for drug law enforcement
and investigation. In addition, the Administrator of DEA was
required to report to the Director of the FBI who was given the
responsibility for supervising generally drug law enforcement
efforts and policies. </p>

<p>In giving the FBI concurrent jurisdiction for enforcement of
U.S. drug laws, the Attorney General followed the recommendation
of a committee that he had established to study the need for
increased coordination of DEA and the FBI in the drug field. This
committee was headed by then Associate Attorney General Rudolph
W. Giuliani. According to Giuliani, the Attorney General's
committee recommended concurrent jurisdiction because: </p>

<p>[W]e believe we can more effectively deal with the large-scale
trafficking groups by coordinating DEA's street-level, undercover
expertise with the FBI's ability to combat large criminal
enterprises. The FBI's 20-year experience in combatting organized
crime will also prove critical to drug enforcement. </p>

<p>Although FBI expertise in organized crime and financial
investigations would be available in drug enforcement work as a
result of concurrent jurisdiction, DEA would continue to function
as a &quot;single-mission narcotics enforcement agency&quot; that
would &quot;give the drug problem the kind of focus it
needs.&quot; </p>

<p>In another action relating to the coordination of Federal drug
abuse efforts, President Reagan issued an executive order on June
24, 1982, directing the office of Policy Development to assist
the President in performing his duties under the Drug Abuse
Prevention, Treatment, and Rehabilitation Act; designating the
Director of the Drug Abuse Policy Office within the Office of
Policy Development as primarily responsible for coordinating,
overseeing, and policy-making for all Executive international and
domestic drug abuse functions; and making the Director directly
responsible for the activities of a drug policy staff within the
office of Policy Development. </p>

<p>Despite President Reagan's stated commitment to the
performance of the functions imposed upon him by the Drug Abuse
Prevention, Treatment and Rehabilitation Act, Congress became
increasingly dissatisfied with a perceived lack of coordination
of such functions. This dissatisfaction became embodied in an
Omnibus Crime Bill (H.R. 3963) which included a provision to
establish an Office of Director of National and International
Drug Operations and Policy, which was described as follows: </p>

<p>Similar in concept to SAODAP, the proposed agency would have
been charged with the overall planning and coordination of
Federal efforts to control the supply of dangerous drugs. </p>

<p>Unlike SAODAP, which had been directed by Congress to
coordinate Federal drug abuse prevention efforts, and unlike
ODAP, which was enjoined to oversee all Federal drug abuse
programs, the proposed Office of Director of National and
International Drug Operations and Policy was envisioned as a
mechanism for coordinating and directing Federal law enforcement
operations. </p>

<p>While the President was considering the merits of H.R. 3963,
an Administration spokesman criticized that portion of the bill
creating the Office of Director of National and International
Drug Operations and Policy: </p>

<p>If the czar . . . is to have the power to direct the drug
enforcement operations of other Cabinet officers, the very nature
of our Cabinet system of government would be drastically altered.
If he is not to have such power, he could do little more than
interfere with the existing mechanisms, which have been working
well. </p>

<p>Two days after this statement appeared, President Reagan
pocket-vetoed H.R. 3963 and issued a memorandum of disapproval
explaining his action: </p>

<p>The creation of another layer of bureaucracy within the
Executive Branch would produce friction, disrupt effective law
enforcement, and could threaten the integrity of criminal
investigations and prosecutions . . . . </p>

<p>The seriousness of this threat is underscored by the
overwhelming opposition to this provision by the Federal law
enforcement community as well as by such groups as the
International Association of Chiefs of Police and the National
Association of Attorney's General. </p>

<p>* * * </p>

<p>The war on crime and drugs does not need more bureaucracy in
Washington. It does need more action in the field, and that is
where my Administration will focus its efforts. </p>

<p>Members of Congress were not easily dissuaded from their
efforts to achieve a greater degree of coordination of the
Federal drug abuse efforts. On February 7, 1984, the Senate
passed a proposed National Narcotics Act of 1984 (S. 1787),
which, among other things, would have established a cabinet-level
office of National and International Drug Operation and Policy.
Under the bill the Director of the Office was authorized to:
develop, review, implement, and enforce U.S. policy concerning
illegal drugs; coordinate all U.S. efforts to halt drug
trafficking into and within the United States; develop, in
concert with the Federal entities concerned with drug control,
budgetary priorities and allocations; and coordinate the
collection and disseminate of narcotics intelligence. </p>

<p>In recommending that S. 1787 be passed, the Senate Judiciary
Committee acknowledged that the Reagan Administration had
undertaken a number of &quot;promising initiatives&quot; in drug
law enforcement. However, the Committee concluded that an Office
of National and International Drug Operations and Policy was
necessary because: </p>

<p>[T]he Committee believes the Administration's anti-drug effort
falls short in one crucial respect: the lack of central
direction. </p>

<p>At least 15 Federal agencies play a role in the regulation of
commerce in dangerous drugs or in the enforcement of other
restrictions . . . . These agencies are located in six different
departments. Under such circumstances, it is inevitable that
divergences as to priorities will arise and that there will be
conflicting interpretations of national policy. Indeed, national
policy in such an area as drug law enforcement must be
continually reevaluated and reformulated; a one-time annual
review and the publication of a broadly-worded strategy does not
suffice. </p>

<p>The Committee also described in some detail the role it
envisioned for the proposed Office: </p>

<p>SOADAP was the same kind of &quot;overlord&quot; agency as the
one contemplated by S. 1787. However, it was flawed from the
beginning in that its effective jurisdiction was limited to
activities aimed at the control of drug demand; it was not given
authority of any substance in the law enforcement field. </p>

<p>* * * </p>

<p>The Committee bill draws from the SAODAP concept, but focuses
on the aspects of drug control that were excluded from the former
agency's purview, i.e., the government's efforts to control the
supply of abused drugs. It is in the area of supply control, be
it in foreign or domestic programs, that the Committee perceives
the greatest current need for central direction. </p>

<p>In recommending the establishment of an office to which the
Reagan Administration appeared to be implacably opposed, the
Senate Judiciary Committee took pains to observe that the
Director of the Drug Abuse Policy office was not capable of
performing the necessary coordinative functions concerning
Federal drug law enforcement efforts: </p>

<p>[U]nder questioning by several Congressmen [of the House
Subcommittee on Crime at a February 17, 1983, hearing on the
coordination of drug enforcement efforts] it became clear that
the director does not have the authority or stature to oversee
the implementation of the Federal strategy. </p>

<p>Anxious to reassure the Administration about the proposed
cabinet-level Office, the Committee made it clear that, in
implementing the legislation, the President would have a great
deal of flexibility; for example, the Office would not have to be
established in the Executive office of the President, and the
Attorney General could be appointed the Director of the central
drug agency. However, the Committee was insistent that the
Director have something like a cabinet-level status because such
status was deemed &quot;necessary if the office is to have the
influence needed to impose a truce on interagency feuding, to
insure maximum participation, and to allocate budgetary resources
for top efficiency and economy.&quot; </p>

<p>Despite the Administration's opposition, the Senate passed S.
1787. However, Congressional conferees compromised and
substituted a National Drug Enforcement Policy Board for the
Office of National and International Drug Operations and Policy
as the means for achieving greater coordination of Federal drug
law enforcement efforts. Both the House and Senate agreed to the
Conference Report, and Public Law No. 98-473 was thereafter
approved on October 12, 1984. Title II of this law was entitled
the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984, and Chapter XIII of
that title was designated the National Narcotics Act of 1984. </p>

<p>Congress established the National Drug Enforcement Policy
Board (Policy Board) because it found that drug trafficking was
estimated to be an $80 billion a year industry; only 5 to 15
percent of the drugs imported into the country were interdicted;
and controlling the supply of drugs was thought to be a key to
reducing the drug-related crime epidemic. The Policy Board,
chaired by the Attorney General, was and is charged with
facilitating coordination of U.S. operations and policy
concerning illegal law enforcement. As Chairman of the Policy
Board, the Attorney General was given many duties, including
advising the Policy Board concerning drug law enforcement and
acting as primary advisor to the President and Congress on
Board-developed programs. The Act, however, declares that nothing
therein authorizes the Board or its Chairman to interfere with
routine law enforcement or intelligence decisions of any agency.
Finally, the National Narcotics Act of 1984 amended the Drug
Abuse Prevention, Treatment and Rehabilitation Act to declare
that one of the duties of the White House Office of Drug Abuse
Policy Board was to insure coordination between the Policy Board
and health issues associated with drug abuse. </p>

<p>The creation of the Policy Board in January 1985 represents
only the latest compromise between the President and Congress in
the ongoing search for more effective coordination of all facets
of the Federal drug abuse effort. It remains to be seen whether
an entity like the Policy Board can effectively oversee, police,
and coordinate all Federal law enforcement efforts and whether
some other mechanism is needed to impose coordination of Federal
demand reduction and supply reduction strategies. </p>

<p>Legislative Responses to the Drug Problem </p>

<p>In addition to the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984,
other important legislative initiatives have been adopted in
recent years. For example, the Department of Defense
Authorization Act of 1982 contained a provision, &quot;Military
Cooperation With Civilian Law Enforcement Officials,&quot; which
was intended to codify the practices of cooperation that had
developed between military and civilian law enforcement
authorities. The Act was also designed to improve the level of
cooperation by delineating precisely that assistance which
military commanders could provide and by permitting military
personnel to operate military equipment that had been lent to
civilian drug enforcement agencies. This legislation was deemed
necessary for the following reasons: </p>

<p>The rising tide of drugs being smuggled into the United States
by land, sea, and air presents a grave threat to all Americans. </p>

<p>* * * </p>

<p>Only through the dedicated work of all of Federal, State, and
local law enforcement agencies can we begin to stem this tide. In
fighting this battle, it is important to maximize the degree of
cooperation between the military and civilian law enforcement. At
the same time, we must recognize the need to maintain the
traditional balance of authority between civilians and the
military. </p>

<p>The most important and innovative part of the legislation was
Section 374, which permits the Secretary of Defense to assign
Department personnel to operate and maintain military equipment
that had been made available to an agency with jurisdiction to
enforce the Controlled Substances Act. This relatively simple
change increased geometrically the potential interdiction
capability of Federal drug law enforcement agencies. </p>

<p>The year 1984 was a prolific one for legislation dealing with
discrete areas in drug law enforcement. The Controlled Substance
Registrant Protection Act of 1984 made it illegal, among other
things, to steal any quantity of a controlled substance from a
registrant. Congress also directed the Attorney General,
notwithstanding the scheduling provisions of the Controlled
Substances Act, to transfer methaqualone, commonly known by the
brand name Quaalude, from Schedule II to Schedule I, with the
effect of making the prescription of methaqualone unlawful
because it no longer had an approved medical use. While remaining
committed to the proposition that scheduling of controlled
substances ordinarily should be handled in accordance with the
administrative procedures mandated by the Controlled Substances
Act, Congress took this legislative action after determining that
circumstances required it to do so and that the adverse effects
of the diversion of methaqualone outweighed its therapeutic
usefulness. </p>

<p>Congress also passed the Aviation Drug-Trafficking Control
Act, which amended the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, to, among
other things, require the Administrator of the FAA to revoke
airman certificates and aircraft registrations of those convicted
of violating any Federal or State law relating to controlled
substances, except where the violations involved possession
offenses. The Act also made it illegal for any person to serve as
an airman without an airman's certificate in connection with a
transportation that constitutes a Federal or State drug felony
offense. </p>

<p>Although the Controlled Substance Registrant Protection Act of
1984, the Aviation Drug-Trafficking Control Act, and the
Congressional rescheduling of methaqualone were necessary laws,
by far the most important drug law enforcement measures passed in
1984 were contained in several provisions of the Comprehensive
Crime Control Act of 1984. The Act included: </p>

<p>(i) Bail Reform Act of 1984: This Act comprises many sections,
but the most important and most controversial was that codified
in 18 U.S.C. Section 3142. Section 3142 provides that when a
person charged with an offense appears before a judicial officer,
the judicial officer must order that, pending trial, the accused
be released on personal recognizance or upon execution of an
unsecured appearance bond; released upon certain listed
conditions; temporarily detained to permit exclusion or
deportation if not a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident;
temporarily detained to permit revocation of a prior conditional
release; or detained. The preventive detention provision states
that the judicial officer must hold a hearing in any case
involving a narcotics offense for which imprisonment for ten or
more years is prescribed to determine whether any conditions will
assure the accused's appearance and the safety of any other
person and of the community. In any such hearing the accused must
prove that there are conditions that will assure his appearance
or the community's safety, if the judicial officer finds that
there is probable cause to believe that the person committed the
offense. </p>

<p>(ii) Comprehensive Forfeiture Act of 1984: This legislation
made extensive revisions to Federal civil and criminal forfeiture
laws and procedures, which had targeted the assets of
racketeering and drug trafficking organizations: </p>

<p>Today few in the Congress or the law enforcement community
fail to recognize that the traditional criminal sanctions of fine
and imprisonment are inadequate to deter or punish the enormously
profitable trade in dangerous drugs . . . . Clearly, if law
enforcement efforts to combat racketeering and drug trafficking
are to be successful, they must include an attack on the economic
aspects of these crimes. Forfeiture is the mechanism through
which such an attack may be made. </p>

<p>This 1984 legislation was designed to eliminate limitations
and ambiguities that had &quot;significantly impeded the full
realization of forfeiture's potential as a powerful law
enforcement weapon.&quot; </p>

<p>With respect to the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations Act, the 1984 Comprehensive Forfeiture Act did
several things, including confirming the Supreme Court's decision
in Russello v. United States, 464 U.S. 16(1983) that a
defendant's ill-gotten profits from racketeering were
forfeitable; defining the property subject to forfeiture to
include real property; making the relation back doctrine, i.e.,
U.S. interest in forfeitable property arises at the time of the
commission of the act that gives rise to the forfeiture,
applicable in criminal forfeiture proceedings; and expanding
post-indictment prior restraining order authority to preserve the
availability of forfeiture assets by making an indictment
sufficient to establish conclusively probable cause that the
property will be forfeited. </p>

<p>The Comprehensive Forfeiture Act also amended the 1970
Comprehensive Act. With respect to criminal forfeiture, the 1984
Act added a new provision to the 1970 act that is applicable to
all felony drug offenses, including the Continuing Criminal
Enterprise offense. In virtually all respects, the drug criminal
forfeiture provisions are now identical to those of the amended
RICO statute. The new drug criminal forfeiture provision also
creates a rebuttable presumption that any property of a person
convicted of a drug felony is subject to forfeiture if the
government establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that
the defendant acquired the property during the period of
violation, or within a reasonably short period thereafter, and
there was no likely source for the property other than the
violation. </p>

<p>(iii) Controlled Substances Penalties Amendments Act of 1984.
This legislation generally enhanced the penalties for violations
of the Controlled Substances Act. Specifically, it provided a
20-year prison term and a $250,000 fine for violations involving
specified large amounts of Schedule I and II narcotic drugs, PCP
and LSD; raised the fine for violations involving all Schedule I
or II substances and enhanced the fines for violations involving
Schedule III, IV, and V substances. With respect to all doubling
provisions for recidivists in the Controlled Substances Act, the
1984 legislation removed an ambiguity in the existing law by
providing that a State drug felony conviction would trigger the
provisions; it went further by providing that a Foreign drug
felony conviction would have the same effect. Finally, the 1984
legislation provided that anyone who distributed controlled
substances on or within 1,000 feet of school property could be
subjected to a prison term or fine or both up to twice what is
otherwise provided. </p>

<p>(iv) Dangerous Drug Diversion Control Act of 1984. This
legislation &quot;represent[ed] the first major updating of the
regulatory provisions of the Controlled Substances Act and the
Controlled Substances Import and Export Act since their enactment
in 1970.&quot; In doing so, the 1984 amendments focused
principally on diversion of drugs of legitimate origin into the
illicit market and the manufacture and abuse of new drugs, such
as controlled substance analogs. With respect to the problem of
diversion, which Congress had attempted to address in the 1970
Comprehensive Act by creating a closed system, the legislative
history states: </p>

<p>Diversion of legally produced drugs into illicit channels is a
major part of the drug abuse problem in the United States. It is
estimated that between 60 and 70 percent of all drug-related
deaths and injuries involve drugs that were originally part of
the legitimate drug production and distribution chain. Also,
diversion of legally produced drugs often evidences the same sort
of large-scale trafficking more commonly associated with the
trade in wholly illicit drugs. </p>

<p>* * * </p>

<p>Unfortunately, experience under the [CSA] over the past decade
has demonstrated that the strong regulatory authority to maintain
a &quot;closed&quot; distribution chain does not exist at the
practitioner level. Yet, it is estimated that 80 to 90 percent of
all current diversion occurs at this level. </p>

<p>In response to this diversion problem, Congress amended the
Controlled Substances Act to, among other things, permit the
Attorney General to deny registration to practitioners if such
registration would be inconsistent with the public interest,
authorize the Attorney General to suspend or revoke a
registration upon the recommendation of a competent state
authority or if the public interest requires it; and authorize
the Attorney General to make grants to State and local
governments in connection with those governments' anti-diversion
programs. </p>

<p>With respect to the problem of the manufacture and abuse of
new drugs, Congress found that: </p>

<p>[T]he procedural requirements for controlling a drug under 21
U.S.C. 811 have proven sufficiently time consuming that they
preclude a swift response when an as yet uncontrolled drug
rapidly enters the illicit market and creates a significant
health problem. </p>

<p>As a result of the Dangerous Drug Diversion Control Act of
1984, Congress gave the Attorney General emergency scheduling
authority. Under that authority, the Attorney General is
permitted to schedule a drug in Schedule I on a temporary basis,
for up to one year, if he determines that such action is
&quot;necessary to avoid an imminent hazard to the public
safety.&quot; In making this determination, the Attorney General
need only consider the history and current pattern of abuse, the
scope, duration, and significance of abuse, and the nature of the
risk, if any, to the public health. The temporary scheduling may
be extended for up to six months while a rule-making proceeding
is conducted for the purpose of permanently scheduling the drug.
Such a temporary scheduling order is not subject to judicial
review. </p>

<p>(v) Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act
Amendments: &quot;Without the means to launder money, thereby
making cash generated by a criminal enterprise appear to come
from a legitimate source, organized crime could not flourish as
it now does.&quot; The 1984 amendments of the Currency and
Foreign Transactions Reporting Act were designed to &quot;fine
tune the [then] current currency reporting law.&quot; One of the
changes adopted increased the civil penalty for violating the
records and reporting requirements of the Act from $1,000 to
$10,000 for each violation and the criminal penalty from $1,000
and 1 year in prison to $250,000 and 5 years imprisonment. These
changes were deemed necessary because: </p>

<p>[I]t is important to recognize that [the requirements] are
primarily directed at persons who make a lucrative career in the
illicit drug trade and organized crime. As such, the penalties
are far too low to deter and punish such activity. Indeed, the
modest penalties now applicable may simply be written off as a
cost of doing business. </p>

<p>The Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984 was intended to,
and did in fact, provide Federal law enforcement agents with
better tools for combatting drug traffickers. However, it is
still too early to evaluate how these tools have been used. </p>

<p>Important legislation in the field of drug abuse since 1981
has not been restricted only to matters relating to improving
drug law enforcement. As noted previously, Congress in 1979
rejected President Carter's proposal that NIDA's State formula
grants for drug abuse programs be consolidated with those for
alcoholism and mental health. Instead it reauthorized the drug
formula grants through September 30, 1981. In passing the Omnibus
Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981, Congress reversed itself and
fundamentally changed the role that the Federal Government plays
in overseeing and funding of drug abuse prevention, treatment and
rehabilitation programs by creating an Alcohol and Drug Abuse and
Mental Health Service Block Grant (ADMS Block Grant). The new
program was designed to distribute the Federal money that had
previously been provided to the States through formula and
project grants and contracts. </p>

<p>One of the principal motivations for adopting the block grant
approach was the belief that the States were in the best position
to determine the most efficacious use of Federal funds: </p>

<p>The ADMS Block . . . [was] established in 1981 to provide
State and local governments greater flexibility and
decision-making authority in focusing Federal, State, and local
resources on needs and priorities they know best and in ways they
believe are best suited to local conditions. Block grants were
also intended to eliminate duplication and overlapping of
services and allow States to better integrate and coordinate
services funded by several levels of government. </p>

<p>In addition to establishing the ADMS Block Grant, the Omnibus
Budget Reconciliation Act specified how the States were to spend
their allotment. Although requiring the States to file reports
with information permitting the Secretary of Health and Human
Services to determine whether the Federal funds provided were
expended in conformity with the objectives of the block grant,
the Act also directed the Secretary not to impose burdensome
reporting requirements. The reporting requirements concerning the
block grant imposed by the Secretary were much less extensive
than those existing under the categorical programs that existed
prior to the adoption of the block grant approach. </p>

<p>The impact of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act has been
estimated: Since the establishment of the ADMS Block Grant, the
amount of Federal money going to State drug abuse prevention and
treatment programs has declined by approximately 40 percent. It
is not possible, however, to determine what the impact of this
reduction has been because a portion, perhaps significant, of the
reduction represents savings due to the elimination of overhead
administrative costs. </p>

<p>Law Enforcement and Executive Responses to the Drug Problem. </p>

<p>Recognizing that drug abuse and drug trafficking are serious
national problems, which also pose a threat to national security,
the Reagan Administration has taken steps since 1981 that have
been designed to improve Federal law enforcement efforts against
drug traffickers. </p>

<p>Narcotics intelligence is essential to any drug law
enforcement program. In that regard, on December 4, 1981,
President Reagan issued an executive order, entitled &quot;United
States Intelligence Activities,&quot; which was intended to
&quot;control and provide direction and guidance to the
Intelligence Community.&quot; Among the executive order's
provisions relating to drugs, one authorizes agencies within the
U.S. Intelligence Community to participate in law enforcement
activities to investigate or prevent international narcotics
activities and to render assistance and cooperation to law
enforcement authorities not otherwise precluded by law. In
addition, agencies within the Intelligence Community are
authorized to collect, retain, or disseminate information
concerning U.S. persons obtained during the course of a lawful
international narcotics investigation or incidentally obtained
information indicating involvement in activities that may violate
federal, state, local or foreign laws. Finally, the Executive
Order directs that all departments and agencies involved in the
U.S. intelligence effort shall cooperate to provide the President
and the National Security Council with information on which to
base decisions concerning the conduct and development of foreign,
defense, and economic policy and the protection of U.S. national
interests. </p>

<p>Whether the U.S. Intelligence Community has played or will
play the important role in the Nation's anti-drug effort
envisioned for it by Executive Order 12333 depends upon the
commitment of its constituent departments and agencies to
eliminating this threat to national security. The Executive Order
was an important event because it represented recognition at the
highest level of the Executive Branch that, without accurate and
adequate strategic, operational, and tactical narcotics
intelligence, the Federal drug trafficking prevention effort
would be seriously crippled. </p>

<p>During 1981 the deleterious effect of drug trafficking on the
quality of life in Florida, and especially in South Florida, had
become so great that the State's citizens demanded prompt and
effective responses by government at all levels. At the Federal
level, President Reagan established on January 28, 1982, a
cabinet-level South Florida Task Force, also known as Operation
Florida, which was chaired by Vice President Bush, to
&quot;assist and coordinate Federal efforts with those of State
and local authorities in order to reduce crime&quot; and which
was patterned after previous multi-agency efforts, such as the
CENTAC program. The South Florida Task Force was intended to be a
&quot;broad, multifaceted anti-crime program,&quot; but its focus
was on interdiction and the arrest and prosecution of drug
smugglers. Assistance to the South Florida Task Force, which
became operational on March 15, 1982, was provided by DEA,
Customs, FBI, BATF, the Marshals Service, the Coast Guard, and
the Department of Defense. </p>

<p>One of the more significant features of the South Florida Task
Force was the creation of the South Florida Joint Task Group,
which consisted of DEA and Customs personnel and which was
charged with conducting follow-up investigations of drug
interdictions. In authorizing Customs agents to conduct such
investigations under the supervision of DEA on March 20, 1982,
the Attorney General modified, albeit slightly, the structure of
Federal drug enforcement that had been established by President
Nixon's 1973 reorganization plan. That plan had prohibited
Customs agents from exercising investigative, intelligence, and
law enforcement functions at locations away from ports of entry
or borders. This action was in effect a recognition, long
overdue, that it was necessary, if law enforcement efforts
against drug trafficking were to be improved, for Customs'
intelligence and investigative functions to be expanded. </p>

<p>Operations Greenback and Florida were successful in that they
forced traffickers to reduce their activities in Florida.
However, the increased law enforcement pressure, as had happened
so many times in the past, resulted in the traffickers diverting
drug smuggling to Gulf and Eastern ports of entry and their money
laundering activities to New York and the California-Mexico area.
The successes achieved by the Florida multiagency operations thus
exacerbated an already serious nationwide drug problem, but they
also provided a model for responding to that problem. In 1982 the
Attorney General appointed a committee to develop new approaches
to the drug trafficking problem. The Committee concluded that
&quot;no single agency could cope with the problem&quot; and that
&quot;many previous cooperative ventures, although limited in
scope by comparison, provided the promise that agencies can
cooperate and . . . only full-scale teamwork could meet the
crisis . . . .&quot; The Committee's conclusions led to President
Reagan's announcement on October 14, 1982, of the formation of 12
regional Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces, which were
authorized in January 1983 and became operational during the
spring of that year. </p>

<p>The Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force Program
(OCDETF Program) is modeled after the South Florida Task Force,
but its objectives are quite different. While the primary
objective of the South Florida Task Force is the interdiction of
drugs, the focus of the OCDETF Program is the leaders of large
organizations, which control drug importation and distribution
networks, and the disruption of those networks. The participating
Federal agencies are the U.S. Attorney's offices, DEA, FBI,
Customs, BATF, IRS, the Coast Guard, and the U.S. Marshals
Service. The OCDETF Program differs from previous multi-agency
law enforcement efforts in several respects: the task forces are
directly controlled by the Attorney General; the initial funding
was under the control of the Attorney General; and the task
forces are to focus on only one major segment of organized
criminal activity, drug trafficking. Because the OCDE Task Forces
are not intended to replace existing Federal enforcement efforts
against drugs and organized crime, the work of the organized
Crime Strike Forces and the South Florida Task Force continue, as
do the efforts of the FBI, DEA, Customs, and U.S. Attorneys
directed against organized crime groups involved in drug
trafficking. </p>

<p>Shortly after the establishment of the OCDETF Program, the
Reagan Administration adopted another multi-agency approach to
one facet of the Nation's supply reduction efforts, interdiction,
by creating the National Narcotics Border Interdiction System
(NNBIS) which was to be headed by Vice President Bush. NNBIS was
given the responsibility for informally coordinating the
interdiction efforts of other organizations; it could recommend,
but not require, that the organizations take certain actions, and
it itself was not authorized to interdict drugs. When it became
operational, NNBIS took over the interdiction coordination
responsibilities of the South Florida Task Force. Despite the
establishment of the National Drug Enforcement Policy Board in
1984, NNBIS continues to operate as an interdiction coordinating
body.<br>

<h2>Drug Abuse, Drug Trafficking, &amp; Organized Crime </h2>

<p><b>President's Commission on Organized Crime, 1986 </b></p>

<hr>

<h2>Chapter V Drug Enforcement, Policy, and Reducing Drug Demand </h2>

<p>Introduction </p>

<p>The preceding chapter of this report discusses the historical
development of Federal drug policy and demonstrates that the
Federal response to the problems of drug abuse and drug
trafficking has become more complex over time. A good indicator
of the present complexity of the Federal response is the fact
that 32 Federal agencies are now involved in the multifaceted
effort to reduce the supply of and demand for drugs. In this
chapter, the Commission describes the current anti-drug efforts
of the principal Federal agencies and their roles in the national
strategy. The agencies are grouped by function, beginning with
those with central policy roles, followed by international
efforts, interdiction, domestic enforcement, data gathering,
intelligence, and United Nations efforts. </p>

<p>Overall Policy </p>

<p>The National Drug Enforcement Policy Board </p>

<p>The National Narcotics Act of 1984 created the National Drug
Enforcement Policy Board (the Board). This Cabinet-level Board
consists of the Attorney General as Chairman and the Secretaries
of State, Treasury, Defense, Transportation, and Health and Human
Services, as well as the Directors of Central Intelligence and
the Office of Management and Budget, as members. It is the latest
manifestation in the persistent effort to achieve singularity of
purpose in the fight against drug abuse, despite the diversity of
Federal agencies involved. This fact is explicitly recognized in
the pertinent statutory language, found at 1302(b) of the Act, in
which Congress expresses its intent to: </p>

<p>(1) Maintain a national and international effort against
illegal drugs; </p>

<p>(2) Coordinate fully the activities of the Federal agencies
involved; and (3) Charge a single, competent, and responsible
high-level Board of the United States Government, chaired by the
Attorney General, with responsibility for coordinating United
States policy with respect to national and international drug law
enforcement. </p>

<p>This intent is based upon sweeping Congressional findings set
forth in Section 1302(a) of the Act: </p>

<p>(1) The flow of illegal narcotics into the United States is a
major and growing problem. </p>

<p>(2) The problem of illegal drug activity falls across the
entire spectrum of Federal activities both nationally and
internationally. </p>

<p>(3) Illegal drug trafficking is estimated by the General
Accounting office to be an $80 billion per annum industry in the
United States. </p>

<p>(4) The annual consumption of drugs has reached epidemic
proportions. </p>

<p>(5) Despite the efforts of the United States Government and
other nations, the mechanisms for smuggling opium and other hard
drugs into the United States remain virtually intact, and United
States agencies estimate that they are able to interdict no more
than 5 to 15 percent of all hard drugs flowing into the country. </p>

<p>(6) Such significant indicators of the drug problem as
drug-related deaths, emergency room visits, hospital admissions
due to drug-related incidents, and addiction rates are soaring. </p>

<p>(7) Increased drug trafficking is strongly linked to violent
addiction-related crime, and recent studies have shown that over
90 percent of heroin users rely upon criminal activity as a means
of income. </p>

<p>(8) Much of the drug trafficking is handled by syndicates, a
situation that results in increased violence and criminal
activity because of the competitive struggle for control of the
domestic drug market. </p>

<p>(9) Controlling the supply of illicit drugs is a key to
reducing the crime epidemic confronting every region of the
country. </p>

<p>(10) The magnitude and scope of the problem requires the
establishment of a National Drug Enforcement Policy Board,
chaired by the Attorney General, to facilitate coordination of
all Federal efforts by relevant agencies. </p>

<p>(11) Such a Board must have responsibility for coordinating
the operations of Federal agencies involved in attacking the
problem through the development of policy and resources, so that
a unified and efficient effort can be undertaken. </p>

<p>To accomplish the statutory purpose, S. 1304 of the Act
specifically empowers the Board to improve policy development and
coordination among Federal agencies by: </p>

<p>(1) reviewing, evaluating, and developing U.S. government
policy, strategy, and resources with respect to drug law
enforcement efforts, including the setting of budgetary
priorities and development of a national and international drug
enforcement strategy; </p>

<p>(2) facilitating coordination of all U.S. government efforts
to halt national and international trafficking in illegal drugs; </p>

<p>(3) coordinating the collection and evaluation of information
necessary to implement U.S. policy with respect to drug law
enforcement. </p>

<p>In furtherance of these aims S. 1306 of the Act directs the
Director of the Drug Abuse Policy Office to serve as an advisor
to the Board on matters related to health issues in the drug
abuse field. As a principal figure in the area of interdiction,
the Vice President is included as an ex officio member. </p>

<p>Under this scheme the Attorney General as Board Chairman, in
consultation with the other members, supervises the preparation
of initiatives for consideration by the Board. The Board, under
the direction of the Chairman, then determines which items to
include on its agenda and what priority each is to receive. Such
items are then referred to the Coordinating Group, chaired by the
Deputy Attorney General and consisting of senior officials from
the member agencies. </p>

<p>The Coordinating Group in turn is to submit to the Board
practical recommendations, based on consultation with the
agencies involved, for resolving drug law enforcement issues and
developing appropriate Federal policy. Both the Board and the
Coordinating Group are supported in their efforts by a full-time
professional staff charged with performing necessary research,
analysis, and writing. This staff is composed of individuals
drawn from various principal agencies. The intent of this
multi-agency composition at all levels, Board, Coordinating
Group, and staff, is a reflection of the Board's intent, as
expressed in its 1985 Interim Act to Congress: </p>

<p>This structure reflects the need for interagency participation
at every level of Policy Board activity. The underlying principle
is that there is a practical advantage to resolving differences
at the lowest level possible. Disagreements on issues will
inevitably occur among various agency participants, but if all
points of view are represented at each level, many differences
can be worked out by the Staff or Coordinating Group rather than
being elevated to the Policy Board. </p>

<p>Section 1304(a) of the Act specifically directs the Board to
focus its work on two parts of the five-point National Strategy
on Drug Abuse: drug law enforcement and international
cooperation. In the area of drug enforcement, the Board pursues
four principal strategies: 1) illegal drugs are to be destroyed
at their source; 2) drug contraband is to be intercepted and
seized en route to or at the borders of the United States; 3)
drug trafficking organizations are to be identified, investigated
and prosecuted, and drug related assets seized and forfeited; and
4) regulatory means are to be exercised to stem diverted drug
abuse. </p>

<p>The Board commenced its activities on April 24, 1985, almost a
year after its creation. In its first meeting, it adopted the
organizational structure described above. In the months between
April 1985 and the end of that year, the Board met five times and
the Coordinating Group, five times. Issues referred to the
Coordinating Group during that time include &quot;designer&quot;
drugs, efforts to improve government-wide drug seizure
statistics, and drug crisis management. Its agenda includes a
report in January 1986, required by the Narcotics Act of 1984, on
the Board's achievements and the effectiveness of its policies to
combat national and international drug trafficking. It is also to
publish a 1986 strategy report. Items under consideration for
inclusion in the Boards agenda are: </p>

<p>Budget Review. The Government has increased substantially the
amount of resources devoted to drug law enforcement. Because of
the numerous agencies and departments now involved in combatting
drug trafficking, the Policy Board is an ideal forum for
considering the Government's overall drug law enforcement budget.
The Board may undertake budget reviews to determine whether
resources are appropriately allocated. Consideration will also be
given to insuring proper interagency balance and the optimal use
of tax dollars and resources in the drug war. </p>

<p>Memoranda of Understanding. The Board may review the numerous
jurisdictional Memoranda of Understanding between Federal
agencies to determine the effectiveness of these mechanisms for
interagency cooperation. </p>

<p>Interdiction. The Board may examine all of the interdiction
programs currently in place. Since, in the last few years, the
Federal Government has made an increased effort to prevent
illegal drugs from entering the United States, the Board may
propose to analyze the effectiveness of interdiction as an
overall law enforcement strategy. The Board will also consider
the experience gained from the 1981 exception to the Posse
Comitatus Act to determine whether additional legislative action
is needed. </p>

<p>Eradication. The Board proposes to assess the efficacy of all
eradication strategies and the cost-effectiveness of eradication
as a drug law enforcement strategy. In addition, it will address
how eradication relates to other elements of our enforcement
strategy. Because domestic marijuana reduction involves a number
of agencies, this issue is well suited to a study by the Policy
Board and its staff. </p>

<p>Other Issues. The Board may also refer other issues for
additional staff analysis. These might include: money laundering;
financial investigative techniques, including asset forfeiture;
the relationship of supply and demand reduction strategies; and
the collection and sharing of drug intelligence. </p>

<p>The Board's vision of its role is summed up in its Interim
Report: </p>

<p>The Board is assuming the task of coordinating all drug
related programs. To do this, the Board may develop a planning
and management process for policy development and evaluation of
the nation's narcotics law enforcement programs. </p>

<p>White House Drug Abuse Policy Office </p>

<p>Created within the White House by Executive Order 12368, the
Drug Policy Abuse Office was established to ensure that the
President is provided with a center for coordination and
oversight of both national and international drug abuse functions
of all executive branch agencies. The role of this office has
been expanded to include drug trafficking issues as well. The
office publishes a regular report on both drug abuse and drug
trafficking, the National Strategy, which provides policy
direction for all agencies involved in anti-drug efforts. As part
of the White House Office of Policy Development, the White House
Drug Abuse Policy Office provides the President with a direct
advisor on drug abuse policy matters. </p>

<p>International Efforts </p>

<p>Bureau of International Narcotics Matters </p>

<p>As the Federal agency responsible for coordinating the United
States' drug control efforts overseas, the Department of State's
Bureau of International Narcotics Matters (BINM) is pivotal in
implementing U.S. anti-drug policy on the international level.
BINM attempts to encourage foreign coordination for joint illicit
drug control activities; bilateral assistance for crop control
and interdiction programs in the form of equipment, training and
technical advisory services; participation in international
organizations to increase drug control efforts in licit and
illicit drug production countries; training programs for foreign
personnel in illicit drug control functions to strengthen
interdiction and enforcement efforts; guidance, coordination and
support of the work abroad of all U.S. government agencies
involved in drug control; and technical assistance for
international demand reduction. BINM currently provides support
for drug eradication efforts in 14 countries and is in large part
responsible for much of the world's crop control and eradication
efforts, described elsewhere in this report. </p>

<p>Agency for International Development </p>

<p>Section 126 of the Foreign Assistance Act instructs the Agency
for International Development (AID) to &quot;give priority
consideration to programs which would help reduce illicit
narcotics cultivation by stimulating broader development
opportunities.&quot; Given this mandate, AID issued Policy
Determination No. 1 on drugs in 1982, encouraging the design of
projects that provide economic alternatives to farmers in drug
growing areas. Overseas, AID coordinates with the State
Department's Bureau of International Narcotics Matters. </p>

<p>AID drug control efforts include finding a suitable mix of
substitute crops, assuring free market incentives, and
encouraging appropriate host country pricing and marketing
policies. AID attempts to develop and implement development
projects that facilitate the host government's enforcement of
existing bans on drug production. </p>

<p>Department of Agriculture </p>

<p>The United States Department of Agriculture through the
Agricultural Research Service (ARS) assists in the control of
illicit drug plants by providing technical information pertaining
to eradication and substitute crops. Scientists in the ARS
conduct research on the use of herbicides and other techniques
for eradication, as well as the use of substitute crops for
farmers presently producing drugs. ARS scientists also provide
expert advice to the State Department and cooperating foreign
countries regarding proposed eradication programs. Potential
adverse environmental impacts are assessed prior to the
recommendation of control measures, whether it be chemical,
mechanical, fire, biological, or through genetic manipulation or
a combination of two or more of these techniques. Scientists from
ARS have been involved in drug research since 1972 and have
assisted control authorities in several drug producing countries
in the Americas and the Near and Far East. </p>

<p>Interdiction </p>

<p>National Narcotics Border Interdiction System </p>

<p>The National Narcotics Border Interdiction System (NNBIS)
attempts to accomplish comprehensive planning in the limited area
of interdiction at or approaching U.S. borders. NNBIS was created
by the President on March 23, 1983, and is directed by the Vice
President. </p>

<p>NNBIS' mission is to improve border interdiction by
accomplishing a threefold goal: to continue to improve
interagency coordination among law enforcement agencies; to
maximize the participation of the military services and Federal
agencies involved in drug interdiction; and to increase and
provide interaction for intelligence community involvement in
interdiction efforts. Participating agencies include the U.S.
Customs Service, the U.S. Coast Guard, the Drug Enforcement
Administration (of particular importance is the contribution of
DEA's El Paso Intelligence Center - EPIC) the Border Patrol, the
Department of Defense, the Central Intelligence Agency, the
Federal Aviation Administration, the National oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration, the Federal Communications
Commission, and the Department of State. NNBIS itself consists of
a headquarters staff in Washington, D.C. and six regional
offices: Miami, New Orleans, El Paso, New York, Chicago and Long
Beach, California. </p>

<p>Actual interdiction at or approaching U.S. borders is
accomplished by individual agencies during single agency or
multi-agency special operations. The role of NNBIS is to provide
necessary equipment, intelligence, detection and trend analysis
support. Specific NNBIS contributions to drug seizures consist of
direct support, such as the passing of &quot;real-time&quot;
information, general information, or regional analysis. NNBIS
staffs, consisting of agency-contributed personnel in both
Washington and the regional centers, coordinate with contributing
agency staffs to lay the groundwork for special initiatives,
which then can proceed in a timely fashion to enhance drug law
enforcement efforts. Of critical importance in understanding
NNBIS' role is the fact that the activity has no funding of its
own. It is entirely dependent upon agency contributions of
manpower and intelligence and does not have a direct operational
authority. It can only inform and advise its constituent agencies
concerning opportunities for coordinated or expanded operations.
Thus, criticisms of NNBIS, alleging that many seizures would have
occurred anyway, even if NNBIS did not exist, miss the point.
Individual agencies are intended, indeed mandated, to carry out
their missions, including contraband seizures. NNBIS is intended
to supplement, not replace, those efforts. It has a steadily
improving record of doing so, a fact recognized even by some
critics. </p>

<p>Operation Hat Trick I </p>

<p>In the fall of 1984 Hat Trick I, the first major coordination
effort attempted under the NNBIS management mechanism, was
undertaken. Hat Trick I was designed to disrupt the transshipment
of the fall harvest of marijuana from Colombia, while
simultaneously intercepting any cocaine shipped during the
operation. </p>

<p>During the 60-day operation, an intercept line of Coast Guard
and Navy ships was formed in the Caribbean to halt smuggling
vessels. The Department of Defense supplemented the operation
with electronic equipment capable of detecting both aircraft
which flew over the ships and vessels which slipped through the
net. Additionally, the Customs Service and Border Patrol
increased their efforts at and between the ports of entry to the
United States, and the intelligence community added previously
unprecedented support to the effort. This multi-agency approach
emphasized the critical need for compatible communications
capabilities. This lesson is being carried forward in current
operational planning. </p>

<p>The anticipated reaction to this operation was an attempt by
the smugglers in Colombia to stockpile shipments. To counter
this, multi-agency teams, headed by the Department of State,
visited Colombia and neighboring countries to brief officials
there about the operation and to elicit their support. The
Colombian government, which had declared a &quot;war without
quarter&quot; against drugs the previous year, seized the
opportunity to step up efforts to destroy the marijuana in that
country. Colombian officials were also placed aboard U.S. Coast
Guard cutters, operating off the Colombian coast to coordinate
with Colombian enforcement units. </p>

<p>Operation Hat Trick I proceeded as expected, with massive
maritime seizures, and a significant reduction of maritime drug
shipments. According to NNBIS, over 600,000 pounds of marijuana
and 6,000 pounds of cocaine were seized by U.S. agencies during
the operation. Simultaneously, the Colombian government, through
eradication and destruction of stockpiled contraband, removed
over 50 percent of the fall marijuana crop from possible export. </p>

<p>Operation Hat Trick II </p>

<p>Operation Hat Trick I has come to be viewed as a prototype
effort in it initiated improvements in planning, communications
security, in-country efforts, air operations, intelligence and
resource support. Hat Trick II, a much more ambitious operation
begun in November 1985 and still under way, is the logical
follow-on, drawing carefully on lessons learned from Hat Trick I.
</p>

<p>Coordinated by NNBIS and consisting of the combined forces of
U.S. civilian drug enforcement agencies and all branches of the
military, Hat Trick II involves increased land and air patrols to
disrupt drug traffic into the United States. The long-term goal
of the operation is to affect the worldwide availability of drugs
by increasing international pressure on trafficking
organizations. It is a complex operation that tightens
surveillance along our border with Mexico and along the known air
and ocean supply routes from South America and other Caribbean
countries. </p>

<p>The United States Navy and the Coast Guard, working together,
provide the primary maritime surveillance and interdiction forces
for Hat Trick II, while the U.S. Customs Service works as the
lead agency with the Navy, Air Force, Army and Marines in
directing air operations. The Customs Service and the Immigration
and Naturalization Service Border Patrol are conducting
intensified operations all along U.S. land and sea borders.
Through Department of State and DEA initiatives, the U.S. is
working to provide the maximum coordination of anti-drug efforts
in foreign countries. </p>

<p>Hat Trick II employs military surveillance aircraft to
identify and track smugglers and to exploit the known routes
traffickers use from their source countries to their ultimate
destination. If the smugglers attempt to hide and wait in a
source or transit country, the drug enforcement authorities in
those countries are prepared to seize drugs and make arrests. An
important key to Hat Trick II lies in the ability of source and
transit countries to take advantage of the disruption the United
States has caused in normal drug trafficking. Colombia, Panama,
Venezuela, Jamaica and other countries throughout the region are
cooperating in this international effort. </p>

<p>Hat Trick II has contributed significantly to institutional
change among involved agencies. For example, as a result of
planning initiatives for Hat Trick II, the U.S. Navy has changed
its policies, and Navy ships have served as platforms for a
significantly increased number of Coast Guard interdictions.
Further, military radars have become a much more significant
factor in aircraft seizures. The diversions in smuggling routes
and methods caused by the operation have made drug trafficking a
more costly enterprise for smugglers, and secure communications
enhancements have kept operational information away from them.
Major cocaine seizures have resulted from U.S. Bahamian
cooperation. The intelligence community has greatly increased its
collection and dissemination of tactical intelligence. Each law
enforcement agency has, in essence, developed specialized
intra-agency operations in support of the overall Hat Trick II
effort. </p>

<p>Operation Blue Lightning </p>

<p>To test the effectiveness of conducting an operation with
Federal, State and local participation, as well as exercising the
growing U.S.-Bahamian partnership against drug smuggling, a major
special operation, entitled &quot;Blue Lightning,&quot; was
devised and coordinated from the NNBIS Regional Center in Miami. </p>

<p>Blue Lightning concentrated on two geographical areas, the
Bahamian Archipelago and the area West of the Bahamas up to and
including the coast of Florida. In the Bahamas islands were
targeted as &quot;stash sites,&quot; or drug holding areas, and
unannounced sweep teams were flown in to search for contraband.
The sweep teams were composed of Bahamian Police, transported by
U.S. military helicopters. Efforts were coordinated by the DEA
and U.S. Embassy in Nassau. The effort outside the Bahamas
included coordinated, augmented air and sea detection capability
up to the Florida coast. As a primary participant in the NNBIS
coordinated operation, the U.S. Customs Service was requested to
assume lead agency status for the portion of the operation
outside the Bahamas. Overall Blue Lightning participants included
16 State, county and city law enforcement agencies, the Customs
Service, Department of Defense, Coast Guard, and National Park
Service in addition to the DEA and the Government of the Bahamas.
Additionally, Bahamian personnel were assigned to South Florida
for the duration of the operation to fly law enforcement missions
with U.S. Customs. </p>

<p>The raids by Bahamian authorities forced smugglers to move
their drugs to the U.S. immediately, where law enforcement units
were positioned to intercept them. Over 6,000 pounds of cocaine,
33,000 pounds of marijuana, and over $1.5 million worth of
vessels, aircraft, trailers and cash were seized. Additionally,
interdiction techniques were tested and refined, heightening the
ability to conduct coordinated international and interagency
operations. </p>

<p>U.S. Coast Guard </p>

<p>Responsible in large part for U.S. drug interdiction efforts,
the Coast Guard's strategy has been mainly directed toward
intercepting motherships as they transit the major passes of the
Caribbean. To effect this &quot;choke point&quot; strategy, the
Coast Guard conducts both continuous surface patrols and frequent
surveillance flights over the waters of interest, and boards and
inspects suspect vessels at sea. In the past major Coast Guard
resources have been concentrated in the &quot;choke points&quot;
traditionally transversed by traffickers. Cutters now more
frequently patrol the Bahamas, the eastern passes of the
Caribbean, and the Gulf, Atlantic and Pacific coastal areas. </p>

<p>During the past several years the Coast Guard has increased
the number of cutter patrol days and aircraft operating hours
devoted to drug interdiction, increasing their ability to respond
quickly to sightings and other intelligence. In addition, the
Coast Guard is deploying leased Sea Based Aerostats (SBAs), which
are small tethered balloons equipped with surface search radar,
tethered offshore at sufficient altitude to greatly increase its
range. As part of a coordinated operation, surface target
information is paused to a command and control cutter for
evaluation and deployment of other assigned units, both surface
and air. </p>

<p>Better intelligence remains an important factor in increasing
the Coast Guard's overall interdiction effectiveness. The most
critical need is timely and accurate information on the number,
identity, location and destination of vessels and aircraft
carrying contraband which are bound for the United States. During
the past two years improvements have been made in the collection,
evaluation, and dissemination of intelligence. A new intelligence
coordination center in Washington, D.C. maintains a 24-hour
all-source watch to exploit all intelligence systems available to
the Coast Guard, and produces intelligence tailored to the needs
of operational commanders. The Coast Guard is also continuing
liaison with the law enforcement community's intelligence
network. </p>

<p>U.S. Customs Service </p>

<p>The U.S. Customs Service participates in several multiagency
investigative programs, including the Florida Joint Task Group
and the President's Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force.
The efforts of these two programs alone resulted in 1,194 arrests
and drug seizures of 35,702 pounds of cocaine, 132 pounds of
heroin, and 3,848,293 pounds of marijuana from FY 1952 to FY
1985. </p>

<p>Prompted by the increasing sophistication of violators of
critical technology and trade laws, including individuals in
drug-related activities, the Customs Service established an
Office of Intelligence in 1981. Customs-acquired intelligence of
national security interest is, for the first time, actively being
disseminated to community agencies, and the intelligence
community is currently developing information useful for drug
enforcement. The development of secure communications facilities
within the Customs Service, currently underway, will further
enhance this capability. </p>

<p>The Customs Aviation and Marine Programs are consistently
changed and upgraded to reflect new technologies and equipment
and improved tactics and strategy. Drug smugglers have responded
to these programs by adjusting their routes to elude the
increased effectiveness of enforcement officials. </p>

<p>The Customs Service has developed teams of inspectors and
canine enforcement officers to more thoroughly examine persons,
conveyances, and cargo determined to be high risk. These mobile
teams, which use highly trained dogs to detect drugs, allow
Customs to release cargo and passengers deemed to be low risk
without examination, thus speeding the entry of most people and
cargo. The teams comprise 12 percent of the inspectional
workforce, but have accounted for the greater proportion of the
drug seizures. During the first 9 months of FY 1985, they have
been responsible for 66 percent (10,269 pounds) of the hashish,
87 percent (876 pounds) of the cocaine, and 40 percent (243
pounds) of the heroin that has been seized by inspectors. </p>

<p>During the past three years, the Customs Service has attempted
to convince the commercial air and sea carriers of their
responsibilities in the effort to halt drug trafficking. As part
of this initiative Customs contacted the major carriers and
signed cooperative agreements with a number of them. These set
out specific measures designed to prevent and detect the use of
commercial vessels and aircraft that smuggle drugs and other
contraband. Customs works closely with carriers, to apprise them
of their vulnerabilities through regular meetings; to provide a
training program on cargo, aircraft, and facility security; to
perform security surveys; and to compile threat assessments. This
cooperation between Customs and commercial carriers has led to
the detection of drugs and the transmittal of valuable
intelligence to local customs officials. </p>

<p>Department of Defense </p>

<p>In 1981 Congress passed legislation clarifying statutory
restrictions on the use of Department of Defense (DOD) resources
for law enforcement purposes. As a result, the Department of
Defense now has greater freedom to support Federal law
enforcement agencies. DOD resources play an important role in the
Federal drug interdiction program by providing surveillance and
support services, such as using aircraft to search for smugglers
and Navy ships to tow or escort vessels seized by the Coast Guard
to the nearest U.S. port. As of the end of September 1985, the
DOD has been involved in 38 vessel seizures, and their assistance
has been invaluable during NNBIS-directed joint operations. </p>

<p>DOD's increased involvement in drug law enforcement as a
result of amendments to the Posse Comitatus Act, has proved
pivotal in many instances. In fact, the Joint Chiefs of Staff
recommended unanimously in early 1985 that the U.S. military be
engaged to an unprecedented extent in fighting drug trafficking
and production. It called for the implementation of a massive new
program in which military forces would expand their present
supportive role by becoming involved in drug interdiction, in
training Central American nation's anti-drug forces, and in
providing needed weapons and equipment. </p>

<p>Domestic Enforcement </p>

<p>Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force Program </p>

<p>The Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force Program
(OCDETF), comprised of 13 Task Forces nationwide, brings all
Federal agencies with drug enforcement responsibilities together
into a coordinated effort against the largest and most important
national and international drug trafficking rings. Justice
Department agencies involved in the effort include the FBI, the
DEA, and the Marshals Service; Treasury Department agencies
include the U.S. Customs Service, the Bureau of Tobacco, Alcohol,
and Firearms, and the International Revenue Service. The Coast
Guard has a major role in the program as well, and the Department
of Defense offers intelligence and information on sightings of
suspected drug traffickers heading for the U.S. by sea and air. </p>

<p>In slightly more than two and one-half years, the Task Force
has produced 1,721 indictments against 6,545 defendants. The Task
Force emphasis is on prosecuting and imprisoning drug kingpins,
money launderers, and financiers. There is also strong focus on
seizing cash and drug-related assets. In fact, the assets seized
may soon exceed the cost of the Task Force program. </p>

<p>The Task force Program relies largely on the Continuing
Criminal Enterprise Statutory provision and the Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) statute. The
conviction rate in cases reaching disposition is approximately 95
percent. State and local officers participate in nearly one-half
of the Task Force investigations. </p>

<p>New international law enforcement cooperation also has been
achieved, since nearly one-half of Task Force cases target
organizations international in scope. These efforts have received
substantial support from foreign law enforcement agencies, as
indicated by the fact that five percent of Task Force cases now
involve direct participation by foreign police. This has created
a new focal point for international drug investigations. </p>

<p>Drug Enforcement Administration </p>

<p>As the lead Federal drug agency the Drug Enforcement
Administration (DEA) is charged with enforcing the controlled
substance laws and regulations of the United States. DEA also
participates in non-enforcement programs to reduce the demand for
drugs. Part of the Department of Justice, DEA comprises 2,400
special agents in 121 domestic field offices and 61 offices in
over 40 foreign countries. </p>

<p>DEA's primary objectives are: </p>

<p>- To bring to bear all the Federal resources on the arrest,
prosecution, and immobilization of major drug trafficking
organizations via continued coordination with other Federal
agencies and the use of financial and legal tools, emerging
technology, and sophisticated investigative techniques. </p>

<p>- To reduce the supply of illicit drugs from source countries,
thereby reducing the availability of illicit drugs in the United
States and abroad via source country initiatives, assistance to
foreign government, training for foreign law enforcement
authorities, and public support for successful foreign government
endeavors. </p>

<p>- To significantly reduce the diversion of controlled
substances from the legitimate channels in which they are
manufactured, distributed, and dispensed through a vigorous
program of investigations and State, local, and international
cooperation. </p>

<p>- To enlist the active participation of State and local
governments and law enforcement agencies in the national drug
eradication program, clandestine laboratory task forces, State
and local task forces, and other multi-state coordinative
efforts. </p>

<p>- To participate actively and aggressively in the Federal,
State, and local effort to mobilize public support for the drug
enforcement and abuse prevention program by implementing
strategies and educational programs that stimulate cooperation
among State and local criminal justice agencies, school,
businesses, civic, and parent groups. </p>

<p>- To improve the effectiveness and efficiency of DEA
operations through the implementation of specific programs
designed to enhance employee performance. </p>

<p>Domestic Eradication Programs </p>

<p>The DEA's Domestic Eradication/Suppression Program has
expanded significantly since the Drug Enforcement Administration
first provided eradication assistance to Hawaii in 1979, and
currently all 50 States participate in this venture. DEA
encourages State and local eradication and provides training,
equipment, funding and investigative and aircraft resources. In
1984, with 48 States participating, approximately 3.8 million
marijuana plants were eradicated. The Secretary of the Interior
has also been authorized by a recent Executive Order to conduct
an extensive eradication program targeting marijuana plants on
Federal lands. Spraying commenced on October 6, 1985. </p>

<p>El Paso Intelligence Center </p>

<p>The El Paso Intelligence Center (EPIC) is the Drug Enforcement
Administration's national drug information center, with
intelligence systems located at DEA headquarters, and in DEA's
foreign and domestic offices. EPIC's strategic intelligence
program furnishes geographic assessments, estimates, and warnings
of drug availability, production, trafficking trends and routes.
It distributes information to foreign, Federal, State and local
agencies through numerous publications. Its operational
intelligence program directly supports investigations underway
against top-level traffickers and supplies information on
specific organizations and their financial assets to support
investigations worldwide. As appropriate, this intelligence is
shared with other Federal, State and local agencies to ensure its
maximum utilization against drug traffickers. EPIC serves as a
clearinghouse for drug information collected 24 hours a day. With
DEA as its lead agency, EPIC is staffed by special agents and
intelligence analysts working with personnel from the FBI,
Internal Revenue Service, U.S. Marshals Service, Federal Aviation
Administration, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, Customs
Service, Coast Guard, the Immigration and Naturalization Service,
the Departments of Defense and State, and members of the Federal
intelligence community. Today all States participate in EPIC
through chartered arrangements made between DEA and the
individual States. </p>

<p>Federal Bureau of Investigation </p>

<p>Although DEA is nominally the lead Drug Enforcement Agency,
its Director reports to the Director of the FBI. In granting the
FBI concurrent jurisdiction with DEA, the Attorney General has
mandated that the FBI assume a significant drug enforcement role.
He has also directed that FBI expertise in such areas as
organized crime financial investigations and white-collar crime
investigations be fully used in drug enforcement work. </p>

<p>Both DEA and the FBI place strong emphasis on major
distributors and organizations involved in the manufacturing,
importing, distributing and financing of illicit controlled
substances. Conspiracy investigations (particularly the
Continuing Criminal Enterprise and Racketeer Influenced and
Corrupt Organizations Statutes) are the focal point of
investigation efforts. </p>

<p>Internal Revenue Service </p>

<p>Within the Department of the Treasury, the Internal Revenue
Service (IRS) plays a critical role in U.S. drug control efforts
by targeting drug traffickers' profits. IRS Financial
Investigative Task Forces rely on the reports of financial
transactions, filed by banks and other institutions, to identify
financiers of criminal activities and money laundering
specialists. These reports include Currency Transaction Reports
and Foreign Bank Accounts Reports. Through these Task Forces
trace the transferrals of large sums of cash and identify the
proceeds of drug trafficking. </p>

<p>Data Gathering </p>

<p>National Institute on Drug Abuse </p>

<p>The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) is the principal
source for current information about the effects of drug abuse.
NIDA was established in 1972 as part of the Department of Health,
Education and Welfare, and for its first nine years, operated
under a broad mandate that included providing direct financial
assistance for drug abuse education, training, treatment, and
rehabilitation, as well as conducting research programs. With the
passage of The Alcohol and Drug Abuse and Mental Health Services
Block Grant in 1981, full responsibility for carrying out
treatment and prevention service functions was transferred from
NIDA to the States. </p>

<p>Now a part of the Department of Health and Human Service,
NIDA's current role in reducing demand, as set forth both in the
National Strategy and the Alcohol and Drug Abuse Amendments of
1983, is to develop and disseminate new knowledge about drug
abuse, its prevention and treatment, and to exercise national
leadership in encouraging and assisting the private sector, the
States, and local governments to implement and support drug abuse
prevention and treatment programs in their communities. </p>

<p>The NIDA research program has several important components.
Through its epidemiological research program NIDA assesses the
nature and extent of the nation's drug abuse problem and its
trends. NIDA supports two ongoing epidemiological surveys, the
National Household Survey on Drug Abuse and the High School
Senior Survey. NIDA's Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN) monitors
information on the health consequences of drug use through
emergency room visit statistics and through medical examiner
reports. In addition to these major efforts, NIDA provides grants
for a number of special epidemiological studies. </p>

<p>National Narcotics Intelligence Consumers Committee </p>

<p>The 11-agency National Narcotics Intelligence Consumers
Committee consists of the U.S. Coast Guard, U.S. Customs Service,
the Departments of Defense, State and Treasury, Drug Enforcement
Administration, Immigration and Naturalization Service, National
Institute on Drug Abuse, White House Drug Abuse Policy Office,
Federal Bureau of Investigation and Internal Revenue Service.
This Committee was created as the primary vehicle at the national
level for review and dissemination of strategic intelligence. It
publishes an annual report, the &quot;Narcotics Intelligence
Estimate,&quot; which details the supply of drugs to the U.S.
illicit market from foreign and domestic sources, and their
patterns and rates of use. </p>

<p>Intelligence </p>

<p>Central Intelligence Agency </p>

<p>Since the signing of Executive Order 12333 in December 1981,
the Central Intelligence Agency has provided assistance to drug
law enforcement efforts through the collection, analysis, and
dissemination of information regarding foreign narcotics
production. The CIA plans to upgrade its capabilities to gather
and assess drug-related intelligence over the next five years,
and is currently coordinating research to develop technologies
which can be used to better detect drug trafficking. </p>

<p>United Nations </p>

<p>United Nations Fund for Drug Abuse Control </p>

<p>As the drug control arm of the United Nations, the United
Nations for Drug Abuse Control was established in 1979 to assist
governments by helping finance projects aimed at reducing the
illicit supply of and demand for drugs. Projects undertaken by
the United Nations Fund for Drug Abuse Control include replacing
illicit opium cultivation, treating and rehabilitating drug
addicts, strengthening control measures, or organizing
information and education programs. The Fund relies entirely on
voluntary contributions, mainly from governments but also from
private sources. The United States has long been the primary
contributor to the United Nations Fund for Drug Abuse Control. In
early 1983, however, the Fund obtained a $40 million pledge,
extending over a five year period, from the government of Italy
for coca control projects in South America. In early 1984 major
donors to the United Nations Fund for Drug Abuse Control agreed
that development assistance to narcotics growing regions should
be linked to government commitments to control illicit drug
production.<br>

<h1>America's Habit </h1>

<h2>Drug Abuse, Drug Trafficking, &amp; Organized Crime </h2>

<p><b>President's Commission on Organized Crime, 1986 </b></p>

<hr>

<h2>Chapter VI Part 1: Current Supply Strategies: Analysis and
Recommendations </h2>

<p>Introduction </p>

<p>Currently, the great bulk of our Federal drug abuse budget is
devoted to strategies aimed at cutting off the supply of drugs
available to users and prospective users. These strategies, such
as source country eradication, interdiction, and domestic
enforcement, are frequently attacked as expensive, too slow in
producing perceptible results, and frequently dangerous for the
public officials charged with carrying them out. Far too often
such criticism seems to be the result of isolated examination
without regard to the programs' proper long-term goal or
relationship to strategic approaches to reduce demand. </p>

<p>This report attempts to avoid such pitfalls, and in this
chapter, examines and analyzes in its proper context, each of our
Federal efforts to reduce supply. It makes recommendations to
encourage a coordinated, comprehensive effort at restricting the
flow of drugs to the maximum extent possible, while complementary
demand reduction programs take hold. </p>

<p>Legalization of Illicit Drugs </p>

<p>The debate over strategies to reduce supply has produced a
wide range of proposals, including at one extreme the suggestion
that currently illicit drugs be legalized. Profits in the drug
trade are enormous, primarily because drugs are in high demand
and because traffickers charge prices high enough to justify the
risks involved. Proponents of legalization argue that because of
the clear connection between illegal drug trafficking and
organized crime, making drugs legal would remove the enormous
profits in the illicit drug industry a priority. </p>

<p>On the surface, this argument appears to have some merit.
However, it omits any consideration of the health costs of drug
abuse to the individual and to society, a dimension this
Commission views as fundamental. The drugs discussed in this
report are inherently destructive to mind and body.
&quot;Legalized&quot; drugs would still alter behavior, impair
productivity and educational potential, damage vital organs, and
kill. Moreover, legalization would almost certainly increase
demand, and therefore spread this destruction. Finally, this
Commission is not persuaded that legalization would result in
organized crime's abandonment of the drug business. While demand
for drugs in the United States represents a significant share of
global drug consumption, many other countries have a considerable
demand for drugs that would continue to be met by some or the
same organized crime groups now confronting this country. </p>

<p>It is the position of this Commission that legalizing
substances, which by their very nature destroy rather than
benefit the individual and society, will not solve the problem of
drug trafficking and is therefore not a viable option. This
Commission is emphatic in its position that legalization of drug
use is not a viable option. </p>

<p>National Drug Enforcement Policy Board </p>

<p>The National Drug Enforcement Policy Board (&quot;the
Board&quot;), presents a rare, possibly even unique, opportunity
to bring focus and singularity of purpose to the Federal
anti-drug effort. That fact is explicitly recognized in the
legislation creating the Board, wherein Congress acknowledges
that for the first time, a single, competent, and responsible
high-level Board of the United States Government, chaired by the
Attorney General, will be charged with this responsibility of
coordinating United States policy with respect to national and
international drug law enforcement. </p>

<p>The sentiment is echoed by the Justice Department's own
handbook discussing the National Narcotics Act of 1984, which
identifies the Act as &quot;a substantially revised version of
earlier 'Drug Czar' proposals.&quot; </p>

<p>This Commission recognizes and has pointed out repeatedly in
this report that drug abuse, a term including all of the medical,
social, and legal costs imposed on the American people by illegal
drugs, is a problem of proportions unmatched in any other area of
law enforcement. A problem of such dimensions demands a
coordinated response by the Federal government. The creation of
the Board is a major step toward a truly unified, coordinated
enforcement effort. </p>

<p>The performance of the Board to date has been somewhat
ambiguous. On the positive side, the Board has begun to meet, has
adopted an effective and comprehensive membership list for its
Coordinating Group, and has assembled a professional staff,
composed of experienced and able agency representatives. </p>

<p>It is troubling to note, however, that in light of the
acknowledged urgency of the drug abuse situation, characterized
by Congress as an &quot;epidemic,&quot; marked by
&quot;soaring&quot; death rates and a &quot;key to reducing the
crime epidemic confronting every region of the country,&quot; the
Board has yet to assert a clear leadership role. Instead, it has
adopted a more relaxed and collegial approach, waiting three
months after the effective date of the Act to hold its first
meeting. The Board began its work with a suggestion from the
Justice Department that the Board's mandate is &quot;. . . quite
broad and allows a range of possible roles - from an essentially
passive research and analysis to active implementation of drug
policies.&quot; This Commission notes with alarm that this
contemplative expression does not even extend to policy
formulation, which is the core of the Act's mandate. This concern
is heightened by the Board's initial choice of agenda items:
&quot;designer drugs,&quot; drug seizure statistics, and drug
management. These topics are certainly important, but only one,
seizure statistics, would have an impact on the formulation of a
coordinated drug enforcement policy. Even that connection is
remote. Uniform statistics are an important step toward
compilation of the reliable data base necessary to formulate
policy and measure its effectiveness, but that is all they are.
It is also troubling that the Board's first Interim Report to
Congress consists almost entirely of a verbatim recitation of
portions of the 1984 National Strategy. </p>

<p>An urgent but rational approach to the problem of drug abuse
is needed. This must begin with the statement of a goal. What is
the ultimate objective of the policy Board and of our drug
enforcement effort generally? This Commission is of the opinion
that the success of a national drug enforcement effort should
ultimately be measured in terms of reduced usage. The poisoning
of minds and bodies is the evil we are combatting. All other
targets - manufacture or cultivation, processing, smuggling,
distribution, and so on - would be of no consequence were it not
for the terrible destructive force of the use of illegal drugs.
Eliminating drug use, then, must be the cornerstone of a national
policy, and our national operational design - our strategy -
should flow from it. It is at this fundamental level that the
Board's deliberations should begin, difficult as the dialogue may
be. </p>

<p>A key to achieving the Board's essential singularity of
purpose is the commitment of each Board member, on behalf of his
entire Department, to the goal of reducing drug consumption,
accompanied by a resolve that no opportunity for action,
particularly coordinated, multi-agency approaches, will be
ignored on the basis of parochial concerns. However, the use of a
committee in place of a single figure of authority runs the
inherent risk of preserving interagency competition. It is
encouraging to note that the Board has included as
&quot;potential items&quot; for review total budgetary planning
and administrative operations. This Commission submits that
vigorous review of the latter is urgently needed, with special
attention to what is not included in such memoranda and the
reasons for such omissions. </p>

<p>A combined and coordinated effort among the dozens of Federal
agencies and offices, measured by a single standard of success,
is certain to require program dislocations, reordering of
Departmental priorities, and subordination of Departmental plans
to Board direction. It will mean abandoning the &quot;Not
Invented Here&quot; veto, which has far too often blocked
inter-Departmental efforts. Cooperation is the heart of a truly
coordinated national attack on drug abuse. It will require not
just review, analysis and coordination, but initiative by the
Board to overcome unnecessary obstacles, outmoded concepts, and
self-protective agency narrowness. Success will also depend upon
careful attention to long-term coordination between Federal
agency operations and with State and local components, for if
experience has shown anything in the effort against drug
trafficking, it is the resourcefulness and adaptability of the
traffickers. Successful interdiction or enforcement in one area
is virtually certain to result in a relocation to a new area of
operations. Long range planning is critical if our resources are
to be used in a fashion which anticipates such movement, rather
than reacts to it. </p>

<p>It is neither possible nor desirable under our system of law
to invest a Board Chairman or any other &quot;Czar&quot; with
dictatorial power to command other Cabinet members to conduct the
affairs of their respective Departments in a particular fashion.
This fact is reflected in the tone of the Act, which empowers the
Chairman only to &quot;advise, recommend, correlate and
evaluate&quot; and to direct action only with &quot;the
concurrence of the head of the agency&quot; involved. Such terms,
intended to recognize the independence of the various
Cabinet-level agencies, also spread among them a common
responsibility for the success or failure of this vital task. </p>

<p>Intelligence </p>

<p>Accurate, timely, and complete intelligence is vital to the
efficiency of United States anti-drug efforts. Strategies to
reduce the supply of drugs, such as eradication, interdiction,
investigations, and prosecutions are dependent on effective
intelligence gathering. Less commonly acknowledged is that
strategies to reduce demand are similarly dependent on such
intelligence. Adequate data is the foundation upon which focused,
purposeful programs to reduce demand must be built. There is
substantial evidence to suggest that such a foundation is often
lacking in our current approaches. </p>

<p>Intelligence concerning both drug abuse and drug trafficking
must be shared between strategists who are working to reduce
supply and demand. Evidence indicates that thorough strategic
planning, whether concerned with the reduction of demand or with
attacks on supply, must carefully consider the available data on
the other side of the equation. For example, to achieve the most
carefully reasoned deployment of resources, decisions concerning
priorities for disrupting the supply of a particular drug should
consider not only the geographical and political conditions in
source and transit locations, but also carefully evaluate the
geographic and demographic data concerning drug consumption. Such
coordination of data from both sides of the supply-demand dynamic
is crucial to long-range planning. An awareness of traffickers'
ultimate markets will facilitate anticipatory deployment of
resources. This unified theory of planning is the basis for the
&quot;all source&quot; intelligence center discussed below. </p>

<p>Domestic Data Collection </p>

<p>One principal category of drug-related intelligence is
consumption and law enforcement data formally collected within
the United States. Such data are essential to describe and
measure the problems of drug abuse and trafficking. They are also
vital to our efforts to evaluate the effects of various efforts
to reduce the supply of and demand for drugs. The reliability of
these estimates is critical for both policy makers and drug law
enforcement officials. However, because drug trafficking and use
are illicit activities, data concerning them are necessarily
estimates. Compounding this problem is the fragmentation of the
current system of drug data gathering. Much greater coordination
is imperative. </p>

<p>Two primary ongoing studies are used to measure the number of
drug users and frequency of drug abuse in the United States: the
bi-annual Household Survey of Drug Abuse and the annual High
School Senior Survey, both sponsored by the National Institute on
Drug Abuse (NIDA). The Household survey sample includes 5,000
people 12 years of age or older, living in households across the
country. The High School Senior survey questions approximately
17,000 high school seniors. These surveys have been criticized
because they do not include information from those populations
that are frequently involved with drugs, high school dropouts and
people without residences. To compensate for this deficiency, it
has been proposed that these surveys oversample groups thought to
be heavy users of drugs. </p>

<p>While these surveys provide estimates of the extent of drug
abuse, they do not gather important data, such as the price and
quantity of drugs purchased. Such information is crucial for
effective organized crime and drug enforcement policy planning,
because it would provide information concerning the effects of
certain enforcement actions on drug purchasing/using behavior.
NIDA should amend these surveys to include questions about drug
purchases. To the extent possible, they should also be designed
to determine the sources of the funds used to finance drug
purchases. Such data may be crucial to effective prevention
education planning. </p>

<p>NIDA provides two additional data bases of drug use in this
area. The Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN) collects data
concerning drug-related emergency room visits and deaths. These
statistics are based on reports gathered by NIDA from one-sixth
of the country's emergency rooms and two-thirds of the medical
examiners' offices. NIDA collects information about drug users in
treatment through the Client Oriented Data Acquisition Process
(CODAP). Formerly, all States were required to provide such data
as a condition of Federal assistance. However, since the
institution of block grants to partially fund State drug programs
in 1982, the Federal government has not been able to compel
participation in CODAP, and the number of participating States
has shrunk to approximately 15. Because of the importance of this
treatment data, the Federal government should again require
participation in CODAP. </p>

<p>Much data concerning drug trafficking is gathered by the
11-member National Narcotics Intelligence Consumer Committee
(NNICC) and reported annually in the Narcotics Intelligence
Estimates (NIE). This data includes estimates of the amount of
drugs produced and entering the United States, trafficking
patterns, and prices and purity of drugs. Although the NIE claims
to be &quot;the most comprehensive assessment prepared for the
Federal Government on the worldwide illicit drug situation in
1984,&quot; the report also states that, &quot;[b]ecause of gaps
in some of the data used to derive the estimates, there is a high
degree of uncertainty to the resulting estimates.&quot; </p>

<p>In 1983 NNICC prepared a report analyzing the methodologies
used in preparing drug estimates. The report concluded that NNICC
estimates are not timely, with estimates generally 18-30 months
out of date; there is insufficient data concerning the price and
potency of drugs, in part because of inadequate input from State
and local sources; and estimates of the total retail value of
drugs is an imprecise measure, which should be replaced by a
better measurement of final drug sales. In addition, NNICC's
methodology has been criticized as &quot;analysis by
negotiation,&quot; with final estimates resulting from a
bargaining process among the member agencies. Complaints about
the reliability of NIE data also result from the fact that NNICC
does not publish the background data used to develop the
estimates. </p>

<p>Another important set of data in the drug field is the
estimate of the results of drug law enforcement, including the
amount of drugs and property seized, and the numbers of arrests
and convictions and sentences imposed on drug violators. A
significant problem in generating reliable statistics in this
area is the lack of a centralized system for collection. Because
many agencies often are involved in the same case, the amount of
drugs seized and other information may be reported by each
agency. According to the National Drug enforcement Policy Board, </p>

<p>One of the principal problems encountered by the Federal
Government in its efforts to gauge the effectiveness of its
overall drug law enforcement program has been the lack of
centralized statistical information on Federal drug seizures . .
. Because of an undetermined amount of double and triple
counting, reliable statistics on total Federal drug seizures are
not available. </p>

<p>In apparent response to this problem the 1984 National
Strategy called on the Drug Enforcement Administration to develop
and maintain a centralized system for statistics concerning
Federal drug seizures. </p>

<p>As discussed throughout this report, asset forfeiture programs
are an extremely promising source of funding for anti-drug
efforts. Unfortunately, the availability and reliability of
information about non-drug assets seized by all levels of
government is hampered by the same double counting,
decentralization, and inconsistent data gathering methodologies
described above. Although the Department of Justice Asset
Forfeiture Office was created to maintain centralized information
on forfeited assets, the office is still in the process of
developing statistics for total Federal assets forfeited. A study
of State and local officials found that more than one-half of
those surveyed could not estimate the value of property and cash
obtained through forfeiture. State and local governments which
have not already done so should establish asset management
systems for the disposition of forfeited assets to provide
accurate estimates of their value. </p>

<p>Drug Supply Intelligence </p>

<p>With regard to intelligence concerning drug supplies, this
Commission is encouraged by what appears to be a growing
commitment to effective information-gathering. A number of
agencies have reported confidentially to this Commission that
both their funding and priority determinations are giving greater
weight to effective intelligence programs. </p>

<p>Intelligence efforts in this area take different forms,
depending on the topic to which they are directed. All are
subject to the two classic categories of information gathering:
human intelligence, referring to data gathered from human
informants, and technical collection, gathered by such means as
surveillance flights and satellites. In the area of crop
eradication, the lead agency is the State Department's Bureau of
International Narcotics Matters, supported by other members of
our country teams. Issues here include crop conditions, host
country political and military capabilities, and the role, if
any, of groups, including insurgents, opposing eradication
efforts. </p>

<p>Interdiction efforts require tactical intelligence concerning
specific drug movements, such as the identities of those
involved, shipment techniques, vessel and aircraft
identification, routes, and schedules. Also required is
&quot;strategic&quot; information, such as shifts in processing
and staging locations or in transshipment techniques. The current
exclusion of the Customs Service from foreign intelligence
gathering, mandated by the 1973 reorganization plan, particularly
needs to be re-examined. Strategic and tactical intelligence are
critical for border interdiction. Therefore the Commission
proposes that the Customs Service be integrated into the foreign
intelligence process of the Drug Enforcement Administration, to
the maximum extent permitted by the Reorganization Plan currently
in effect. </p>

<p>Because international drug trafficking organizations
frequently locate components of their operations within U.S.
borders, domestic investigations and prosecutions are often
dependent upon effective international intelligence gathering to
supplement such domestic techniques as legal electronic
surveillance and development of informants. </p>

<p>Effective international intelligence collection and
dissemination is not necessarily a highly sophisticated process.
On the contrary, it can consist of information as simple as
providing the names of suspected traffickers known to the Drug
Enforcement Administration to the State Department to ensure that
consular officers do not issue U.S. visas to such persons, or
that issuance be on a controlled basis to assist the
investigative work of DEA. It is encouraging that the National
Drug Enforcement Policy Board, pursuant to the Foreign Relations
Authorization Act for 1986 and 1987, has been directed to compile
a list of such traffickers and prepare guidelines for
inter-agency sharing of that information. </p>

<p>In the area of more sophisticated drug-related intelligence
work DEA and the intelligence community are currently playing
leading roles. The former has recently expanded its foreign
detail by ten percent, and additional expansion is prevented by
lack of funding. This matter deserves careful consideration by
both Congress and the Executive Branch. In addition, the
capabilities of DEA agents presently stationed in foreign
locations are unduly and unnecessarily hampered by the
&quot;Mansfield Amendment&quot; to the Foreign Assistance Act of
1961, which restricts their activities to a secondary role. As
part of a new expression of determination to combat international
drug trafficking, the amendment should be repealed. </p>

<p>The intelligence community is not burdened by any such
ill-conceived restriction. On the contrary, with regard to
international narcotics trafficking, its mandate, found in
Executive Order 12333, is clear, direct, and sweeping: </p>

<p>1.4 The Intelligence Community. The agencies within the
Intelligence Community shall, in accordance with applicable
United States law and with the other provisions of this Order,
conduct intelligence activities necessary for the conduct of
foreign relations and the protection of the national security of
the United States, including: </p>

<p>(c) Collection of information concerning, and the conduct of
activities to protect against, intelligence activities directed
against the United States, international terrorist and
international narcotics activities, and other hostile activities
directed against the United States by foreign powers,
organizations, persons, and their agents. </p>

<p>Although the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has in the past
been criticized for failing to give sufficient priority to drug
trafficking, the Commission is satisfied that the agency is
currently placing suitable emphasis on the issue. This is due, in
part, to the necessary Executive direction now being given to the
intelligence community, and in part to the growing recognition
throughout the government that drug trafficking in many forms and
in many locations has grown to become a national security
concern, transcending the traditional drug-related health and law
enforcement concerns, as discussed in this report. To complement
this effort, additional options are available and should be
pursued. </p>

<p>First, consistent with the direction now being provided to the
intelligence community, the Department of State should vigorously
pursue a program of educating its own foreign-based personnel to
the importance being given to drug-related intelligence and to
the critical need for State Department support for such efforts.
This appears to have been less than entirely adequate in all
instances. Second, the CIA's operational capabilities should be
fully explored to determine how the infrastructure of drug
trafficking organizations can be disrupted, consistent with the
concerns expressed in Executive Order 12333 and elsewhere.
Finally, the CIA's considerable research and development
capabilities should be used to develop additional means for
furthering efforts directed at international drug traffickers. </p>

<p>In connection with these contributions by the intelligence
community, it is encouraging to note the rapid evolution of a
cooperative relationship between the intelligence and law
enforcement communities. This is evidenced by the pertinent
language of Executive Order 12333, which provides that: </p>

<p>1.7 Senior Officials of the Intelligence Community. The heads
of departments and agencies with organizations in the
Intelligence Community or the heads of such organizations, as
appropriate, shall: </p>

<p>(g) Participate in the development of procedures approved by
the Attorney General governing production and dissemination of
intelligence resulting from criminal narcotics intelligence
activities abroad, if their departments, agencies, or
organizations have intelligence responsibilities for foreign or
domestic narcotics production and trafficking. </p>

<p>This direction is complemented by the inclusion of a
representative of the CIA on the Coordinating Group of the
National Drug Enforcement Policy Board. </p>

<p>Defense Capabilities </p>

<p>The intelligence community is not the only available source of
drug-related intelligence. The Department of Defense has a wide
range of facilities, equipment, and operations, which lend
themselves to effective participation. Although such a role is
most frequently discussed in connection with interdiction
operations near the U.S. border, intelligence-gathering
opportunities for Defense Department components exist much
farther afield. Like their counterparts in the interdiction area,
such efforts may be subject to Defense Department directives and
priorities, which in turn rely on a changeable definition of
&quot;national security.&quot; Nevertheless, if as a matter of
national policy, the military view of national security draws
closer to that of the intelligence community, as expressed in
Executive Order 12333, the potential for military drug-related
intelligence-gathering is profound. Because of the connection
between some drug trafficking organizations and terrorist or
insurgent groups, whatever assets are currently in place or in
planning for intelligence-gathering regarding terrorism or
insurgency could just as well function in connection with drug
traffickers. </p>

<p>Intelligence-gathering in source and transshipment countries
would be particularly effective in the interdiction effort, in
the opinion of former SOUTHCOM Commanding General Paul F. Gorman:
</p>

<p>I can't stress enough that it seems to me that the easy way to
operate on the [drug smuggling] pilots is down at the other end.
He is at the other end of his communications tether where the
airfields are much more primitive, where he is dependent on these
cartels and it's easier to penetrate. </p>

<p>Because they occur outside of U.S. territory, such operations
would not violate the Posse Comitatus Act. In addition, with an
expanded definition of national security, such as that manifest
in Executive Order 12333, the Economy Act would not be an
obstacle. Such an expanded intelligence-gathering role is a
desirable course of action for the Department of Defense. The
Commanding Officers of Unified Commands should be given maximum
flexibility in deploying their forces. </p>

<p>Another change in our application of military assets to
drug-related intelligence is much less sweeping in concept, but
nevertheless appears very useful. That is the inclusion of Coast
Guard officers in our Defense Attache programs in drug source and
transit countries. This Commission has been advised that such a
program is in process and encourages the agencies involved to
pursue this program with all due speed. </p>

<p>Allied governments in affected areas could significantly
enhance the intelligence operations of our own military units.
Such activities already under way and worthy of note include a
regional radio communications network being set up among the drug
enforcement authorities of Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and
Venezuela. This network is designed to give these countries the
opportunity to coordinate drug enforcement strategies and work
closely together in confronting the drug trafficking threat
common to all. Agreements signed very recently by Brazil,
Venezuela, and Colombia allow these countries to initiate joint
investigations on their common borders, call for periodic
meetings between drug enforcement police, exchange intelligence,
and solve common problems. Although such efforts must contend
with the endemic problems of corruption and organizational and
national rivalries, they are a step in the right direction. To
the extent that United States assistance can contribute to the
elimination of corruption and other systemic problems, such
assistance should be provided to promote these programs. </p>

<p>All Source Intelligence and Operations Center </p>

<p>Data collection is but one phase of a complete intelligence
operation. To be effective collection should be followed by
thorough and timely analysis and dissemination. This Commission
therefore concludes that this Nation's anti-drug intelligence
efforts should be built upon an all-source intelligence and
operations center. Such a concept is described briefly above in
connection with interdiction efforts. EPIC and NNBIS together
provide an existing core upon which such a center could be built.
EPIC has demonstrated the feasibility of joint agency operations,
and NNBIS has shown that interagency operational coordination,
particularly involving military components, is well within
capabilities. </p>

<p>As a component of a comprehensive intelligence program, such a
center should be designed to collect drug-related intelligence
from the broadest base possible, including those sovereign
nations that will provide consistent, timely data on a
cooperative basis. In this regard, it is encouraging to note that
Latin American drug enforcement agencies are reported to be
planning to establish a regional intelligence center in a
strategic location, such as Panama, in the near future. Because
analysis should be as complete as possible, such a center should
include not only supply and transit-related intelligence, but
also counterpart demand data, including information on such
topics as drug-related deaths and emergency room admissions. This
will allow a complete picture of drug distribution from one end
of the chain to the other. This center would assume the
functions, including issuing annual reports, currently undertaken
by the National Narcotics Intelligence Consumer Committee
(NNICC). In addition, it should integrate all financial data
currently available to agencies of the Federal government, to
enable analysts to complete their knowledge about the drug-money
cycle whenever possible. </p>

<p>To be consistent with the rest of our national effort, such a
center should be under the general direction of the Policy Board
or its delegate, with the Vice President retaining primary
responsibility for management and coordination of the information
related specifically to interdiction. Such a facility would thus
coordinate the collection, analysis, and dissemination of
intelligence, covering every topic from production and
cultivation (including related political issues) to domestic
enforcement and detailed patterns of domestic consumption. It
would also provide the necessary centralized data base for
thorough inter-agency coordination of operations. Given the
sensitivity of many of its sources and the data received
therefrom, the functions and output of such a center would, of
course, require physical and communications security. The
resources and expertise of the National Security Agency with
regard to operational and communications security is an extremely
valuable national asset, which should be exploited to the fullest
extent possible in this connection. As this Commission has sought
to demonstrate repeatedly, drug traffickers have regularly and
successfully sought to penetrate law enforcement communications.
The equipment available for such purposes is readily available.
Communications security thus requires very careful attention in
the planning and design of all anti-drug operations and
facilities.<br>

<h1>America's Habit </h1>

<h2>Drug Abuse, Drug Trafficking, &amp; Organized Crime </h2>

<p><b>President's Commission on Organized Crime, 1986 </b></p>

<hr>

<h2>Chapter VI Part 2: Interdiction </h2>

<p>Introduction </p>

<p>Our National Strategy consists of five &quot;major
elements,&quot; each of which in turn is comprised of numerous
programs and strategies. Interdiction, just one of these
sub-components, presently consumes one-third of the entire
Federal drug abuse outlay for the fiscal year. Measured just in
terms of outlays designated for law enforcement activities,
interdiction's portion swells to almost one-half of the Federal
funds being spent to combat drug abuse. By Commission
calculation, Federal funds devoted to interdiction have increased
100 percent over the last five years. </p>

<p>Despite this massive dedication of funds, drugs of primarily
foreign origin - cocaine, heroin, and marijuana - continue to be
widely available in this country. Many observers, including some
leading drug enforcement officials, readily acknowledge that
interdiction can only serve a limited role in increasing risks to
smugglers while this government pursues other programs. Frank
Monastero, former Assistant Administrator for Operations of the
Drug Enforcement Administration, summed up this view in a recent
interview: </p>

<p>[Interdiction] is important, but it is the least effective
thing you can do . . . it's like the patrolman on the beat . . .
It is preventing [some drugs] from getting into the trafficking,
and that's something. But we can continue that ad infinitum. If
we don't do something at the source or don't do something before
that or don't do something at the end of the trail in the
prevention area, we will never change the situation. </p>

<p>It is the view of this Commission that interdiction is not
going to end drug use or availability in this country. It will,
however, continue to discourage some potential smugglers. This
deterrent effect is often overlooked or denied by many critics,
but not by smugglers themselves. According to Adler B. Seal, an
experienced drug smuggling pilot, in response to a question
concerning the difficulty of recruiting smuggling pilots: </p>

<p>Well, it used to be easy. However, now it has become a little
less attractive for some of the younger pilots. Some of the older
pilots, as myself, have been indicted. </p>

<p>We've been cognizant of law enforcement techniques and the
improvements in it; and the younger pilots are seeing the
newspaper reports of the older pilots and the amount of time that
they are being convicted on and serving, and it's not as
attractive a proposition as it used to be. </p>

<p>Successful interdiction not only discourages some new members
from joining smuggling enterprises, but also encourages some
already in the field to get out of it. This was confirmed by the
firsthand experience of smuggler Seal: </p>

<p>I think that the more flights that are interdicted, the word
gets around. </p>

<p>For instance, I have absolutely - or had in my capacity - no
desire whatsoever to go into and would do anything to stay out of
the south Florida area simply due to the fact that that is where
the concentrated interdiction efforts are being made due to the
Vice Presidential Task Force, which has been highly publicized
and which has taken its toll on the paranoia of the drug
smuggler. </p>

<p>It also appears to this Commission to be consistent with the
view of the Commissioner of Customs, William von Raab: </p>

<p>We are always asked what is a good measure of success against
smuggling. It is always quoted in terms of how much we seize. </p>

<p>I have always maintained that a good measure of success is to
reach a point at which a pilot doesn't want to fly into the
United States anymore; and I have always suggested that there may
be a percentage. </p>

<p>For example, if he has a one-out-of-ten chance of getting
caught, he might run in; but certainly if he had a
nine-out-of-ten chance of being caught, he's not going to do it. </p>

<p>In summary, this Commission recognizes that interdiction is
and should continue to be a vital component of our National
strategy, as a complement to other approaches to reduce drug
supply. Any analysis that defines success in the area of
interdiction as apprehending all, or nearly all, smuggled drugs
is unrealistic and counter-productive. To the extent that is a
very costly approach, additional expenditures must be weighed
very carefully, particularly if they have the effect of reducing
funds available for other efforts to reduce supply and demand.
There are, however, improvements to our interdiction efforts
which can be made without any significant increase in funding.
These steps, which generally involve reordering of priorities or
redefinition of interagency responsibilities, are discussed
below. </p>

<p>It is crucial to note that the single most important need in
the interdiction field is leadership. If innovation and increased
commitment are to be pursued successfully and expeditiously, both
by foreign governments and agencies of our own, a strong leader
orchestrating a single comprehensive plan is the key. That role
to date has been played by the Vice President, and it is one in
which he should continue. The weight of his office has produced
results when other officials might have been ignored. While the
National Drug Enforcement Policy Board necessarily includes
several Cabinet-level officers, they serve as peers. Only the
Vice President brings to the interdiction effort sufficient rank
to lead them. His central role should be preserved and promoted
within the context of the National Drug Enforcement Policy
Board's leadership in drug enforcement. Recognition by the Board
of the Vice President's leadership in interdiction activities
holds the promise of singularly promoting success in that key
area, preserving the momentum and continuity of existing
interagency interdiction efforts, and putting to rest the
confusion that has already begun to surface concerning the Vice
President's relationship to the Board. </p>

<p>Air Interdiction </p>

<p>The United States Customs Service has the lead responsibility
for air interdiction. To combat drug smugglers, some of whom have
the most sophisticated and expensive communications and
navigational equipment available today, Customs has increased its
airborne capabilities significantly in the recent past. At the
time of this report, the Service had just received $11 million in
a supplemental fiscal year 1985 appropriation for its air
operations, bringing the agency's total fiscal year budget for
air operations to $55.4 million. Customs' most significant need,
apart from more aircraft and more sophisticated electronics, is
the support of other Federal agencies with related jurisdictions.
</p>

<p>One example of the need for support is on the diplomatic
front. Customs has for some time found itself frustrated by its
inability to pursue suspected smuggler aircraft into Mexican
airspace after detection on the American side of the border.
Although this has been the subject of numerous diplomatic
discussions, there has been little progress to date. Giving this
matter an extremely high priority in our bilateral negotiations
with Mexico is the type of assistance another agency, in this
case the state Department, can and should provide to Customs in
recognition of the critical importance of the fight against drug
smuggling. </p>

<p>Another Customs' Services critical need is intelligence, both
tactical and strategic. While &quot;cold hits&quot; -
apprehension of smugglers in a random, uninformed basis - have an
important role to play in deterring smugglers by their very
randomness, intelligence is the key to effective interdiction.
According to former Drug Enforcement Administrator Francis
Mullen, every major seizure of drugs from South America made by
his agency has been made on the basis of prior intelligence, and
it is no less critical to the Customs Service. While the topic of
intelligence-gathering is the subject of a separate analysis in
this report, it is important to note in connection with this
discussion on inter-agency support that Customs and the Drug
Enforcement Administration have made considerable progress in the
area of information sharing. Customs has for some time had an
analyst stationed in DEA's Office of Intelligence, and a program
is currently underway to place Customs intelligence analysts in
country teams abroad to analyze data gathered by DEA. This
program should be pursued aggressively. Simultaneously, the
Customs Service should scrutinize its Customs Attache program to
determine to what extent it can play a larger role in
intelligence-gathering concerning smugglers. With its close
liaison with host government customs officials, this program may
be of particular significance with regard to smuggling involving
containerized and other commercial cargo. As interdiction
capabilities improve in the areas of pleasure craft and general
aviation, it is almost certain that commercial cargo will be used
increasingly for concealing illicit drug shipments. This has
already been observed in some cases. Such a Customs effort would
be complemented by the private sector initiatives Customs has
been able to bring about, such as the agreements now in effect
with the Airline Transport and International Airline Transport
Associations. </p>

<p>An active intelligence gathering role for Customs is now
blocked by the 1973 Reorganization Plan. The current recognition
by Customs and DEA of the former's need for time-sensitive
intelligence is of vital importance however, and should be
actively cultivated by the two agencies and the Policy Board.
That this would require modification or elimination of certain
provisions of the 1973 Reorganization Plan should not be an
obstacle. </p>

<p>The area of inter-agency support currently in need of the most
attention is the relationship between the Customs Service and the
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The latter, which has
primary jurisdiction over entry into United States air space,
maintains a number of programs, which lend themselves to support
of Customs operations. While the FAA has to date given
significant support to Customs in a number of instances, more is
needed. To this end, the Customs Service has recently proposed
omnibus legislation, currently entitled the Customs Enforcement
Act of 1985, which contains provisions that address such
sensitive topics as restricted entry points and minimum altitudes
for air entry. Among other things, this Act would require all
vessels and aircraft entering the United States to report
immediately for Customs inspection, and would increase the fines
for failure to report entry. Fines would also be substantially
increased for smuggling controlled substances, and such
violations would be punishable by imprisonment. All assets seized
by Customs, including planes, vessels, and cash, would be subject
to forfeiture. The Act would prohibit airdrops to vessels, make
it unlawful to operate an aircraft without lights, and prohibit
the installation of all illegal fuel tanks in planes. In
addition, commercial carriers would be subject to more stringent
regulations under the Act. While this legislation may be
unpopular with private aviation, it is a collection of important
anti-smuggling measures which go directly to some of the most
frequently encountered drug smuggling techniques. It is worthy of
support. </p>

<p>Similarly, proposals advanced by both Customs and DEA that
aircraft identification numbers, now required to be twelve inches
high and displayed on the fuselage or tail, be displayed on an
upper and a lower wing surface as well are entirely consistent
with anti-smuggling requirements. DEA pilots have been fired upon
from the ground as they tried to fly low enough to read tail
numbers. Although the FAA has stated that an increase in required
number size has no &quot;aviation safety basis,&quot; it is this
Commission's position that needless exposure of Federal agents to
hostile fire should be considered an &quot;aviation safety&quot;
concern sufficient to justify remedial action. Again, reports
that a change in required number size or location would be very
unpopular with the general aviation community seem frivolous in
the context of issues as grave as those under discussion here.
There are a number of additional aviation-related proposals being
advanced by Customs today, concerning such matters as pre-filing
of &quot;border flight plans,&quot; advanced notice of entry into
U.S. air space, and improvements in pilot identification
certificates, which appear to this Commission to be worthy of
adoption, absent some compelling opposition. </p>

<p>There are other promising areas for Customs/FAA cooperation.
Customs reports, for example, that the FAA, in undertaking its
long-term buildup of the approach radar system, is working
closely with Customs to accommodate the latter's needs. This is
to be encouraged, particularly by the Policy Board, which has
both Customs and the FAA on its Coordinating Group. </p>

<p>One legal issue which would benefit from careful analysis by
the Board is the extent to which current asset forfeiture
provisions need revision to enable seizure of aircraft and other
equipment which is rented or leased by traffickers for the
purpose of avoiding forfeiture. </p>

<p>Another area worthy of study is the extent to which Customs'
air interdiction capabilities could be enhanced by Coast Guard
aviation components. Although such a concept might be contrary to
existing understandings, it would be a grave omission if
substantial Coast Guard aviation assets were overlooked,
particularly at a time when fiscal considerations threaten the
Customs air operations budget. </p>

<p>Maritime Operations </p>

<p>In the area of maritime interdiction, the Coast Guard serves
as lead agency. Its success has been remarkable and is limited
only by shortages in resources. New tactics and innovative forms
of assistance by the Navy have significantly improved the Coast
Guard's capabilities. There is no question that not only maritime
traffickers but air smugglers as well are intimidated by the
seaborne detection capabilities of Coast Guard vessels. Inasmuch
as the most critical limitation on Coast Guard capabilities is
the lack of budgeted resources, the single most pressing concern
is the augmentation of the Coast Guard budget to permit more
extensive participation in interdiction operations. A proposal,
which has surfaced annually but to no avail as yet, is the
imposition of user fees for various Coast Guard services now
provided to the boating community gratis. As with the aviation
community in connection with the FAA discussed above, there is
considerable opposition to maritime measures that would
inconvenience the user community or cost it money. However, given
the inescapable facts of the drug invasion this country is
experiencing, the nominal costs of various user fees would seem
to be a small price for boaters to pay as their contribution to
what must be seen as a national effort to defeat a deadly enemy. </p>

<p>In-shore operations of the Customs Service bolster Coast Guard
maritime interdiction operations. Having received over $12
million for maritime operations in its fiscal year 1985
supplemental appropriation, Customs has begun to get fast, state
of the art pursuit boats in the water off the coast of Florida.
These have been used to great effect, and more such craft should
be deployed. </p>

<p>One innovation for which the Customs Service and the
leadership of the National Narcotics Border Interdiction System
(NNBIS) are to be commended is the highly effective integration
of State and local authorities in the recent operation &quot;Blue
Lightning.&quot; It is clear and has been stressed throughout
this report that comprehensive, coordinated multi-agency
operations are absolutely essential to effective anti-drug
programs. On the Federal level, this typically means
&quot;horizontal integration,&quot; i.e., the careful combination
of equal Federal agencies. Blue Lightning is a fine example of
the equally important concept of &quot;vertical
integration,&quot; the well-planned and complementary cooperation
of Federal, State, and local resources aimed at a specific
trafficking activity. The Customs Service and NNBIS are
rightfully proud of this accomplishment and are encouraged to
pursue similar successes in operations to come. </p>

<p>Consolidated Efforts </p>

<p>The evolution of interdiction in recent years has been in the
direction of consolidation of intelligence and operations. This
is a trend characteristic of anti-drug efforts generally, and it
is a proper response to the breadth of the drug smuggling
situation. In the area of interdiction, the most prominent joint
efforts in addition to NNBIS are the National Drug Enforcement
Policy Board (the Board) and the El Paso Intelligence Center
(EPIC). All are described in detail elsewhere in this report. </p>

<p>The following is a proposed realignment of these
organizations, based on this Commission's review. </p>

<p>First, our proposal recognizes the leadership role of the
Board. That important topic is the subject of a separate analysis
in this report. Within the Board and as a part of its coordinated
program, we propose the combination of the functions of EPIC and
NNBIS into a single, all-source intelligence facility. In the
critical early stages of designing and implementing such an
operation, the Vice President's leadership will be invaluable.
The combined intelligence center will incorporate the input of
all intelligence-gathering components at the Federal level,
including those sources already feeding into EPIC and NNBIS, as
well as new sources still to be developed, as outlined below. </p>

<p>The present duplication between the various functions
performed by EPIC and NNBIS has been acknowledged by such
authorities as David Westrate, Assistant Administrator for
Operations of the Drug Enforcement Administration, the parent
agency of EPIC. Although it is true there are certain functions
being performed by each of the two activities, which are not
duplicated by the other, this should not prevent effective
integration of their functions. Everywhere in the current Federal
response, we find a movement toward consolidation and
coordination. Intelligence and planning should not be exceptions.
</p>

<p>A combined all-source intelligence center would require at
least two features not found in either NNBIS or EPIC. One is a
physically secure headquarters facility. EPIC is presently
located in a private office building in El Paso. It has neither
the space nor the necessary physical security to accommodate the
comprehensive input advocated here. NNBIS headquarters is in the
Old Executive Office Building in downtown Washington, and its
regional facilities are located in various Federal buildings
around the country. While such quarters might provide adequate
physical security, they are not equipped to provide for the scope
of the proposed undertaking. A secure facility with sufficient
physical dimensions is crucial, as are secure communications with
participating agency and military headquarters. Ft. Bliss, Texas,
is a potential site, as it provides the necessary physical
security and is located near the present EPIC facility. This and
similar locations should be considered. </p>

<p>The second requirement of the facility proposed here is
enhanced intelligence input. Thorough, &quot;real-time&quot;
intelligence is absolutely vital to effective interdiction, and
it is almost as critically important to other areas of
enforcement operations as well. The importance of intelligence is
such that it is treated as a separate topic below. At this point,
it is sufficient to note that the design of a new center must
from the very outset include the most thorough provisions for the
maximum intelligence contribution permitted by law and physical
and technological capabilities. </p>

<p>Military Support for Interdiction </p>

<p>Perhaps the single most valuable development in the area of
interdiction in recent years has been the assistance rendered by
components of the Department of Defense. Such activities were
constrained somewhat by the Posse Comitatus Act until certain
exemptions to the Act were passed in December 1981. Since that
time the assistance rendered by the military has grown
dramatically. In calendar year 1984 the military provided
assistance to interdiction efforts worth $100 million by Pentagon
calculations. Such assistance is typically in the form of aerial
surveillance, transport of enforcement personnel, and loans of
equipment and personnel as permitted by law. </p>

<p>The role of the Defense Department has become steadily more
active, more innovative, and more flexible. The quality and
quantity of such assistance, however, continue to be limited by
the constraints found in the Posse Comitatus exemptions: military
assistance to law enforcement cannot include direct participation
by military personnel in arrest or seizure activities, and it can
be provided only if it does not affect military preparedness.
Furthermore, law enforcement authorities will be required by the
Economy Act to reimburse the Department of Defense for assistance
provided, unless such assistance is incidental to existing
military operations or provides &quot;equivalent training.&quot;
Reimbursement may also be waived, if such waiver does not
adversely impact military preparedness. In this regard, as in
other, the Department of Defense has been increasingly flexible.
One example of this is the expanded delegation of authority to
waive reimbursement, as found in the January 2, 1985,
modifications to the applicable Departmental directive. Another
is the increasingly positive liaison role being played by the
Department of Defense Task Force on Drug Enforcement. </p>

<p>There are grounds for concern that the military's role
continues to be too narrowly defined. There appears to be a
fundamental misconception at the very top of the Department
concerning the permissible scope of the military's role. Writing
to the Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee in June
1985, Secretary of Defense Casper Weinberger stated that direct
military participation in drug seizures outside United States
territory would do violence to &quot;the historic separation
between military and civilian spheres of activity . . . one of
the most fundamental principles of American democracy. This
Commission has been unable to find the basis for such a
&quot;fundamental principle&quot; of co-equal &quot;spheres of
activity.&quot; The fact is that the military, rather than being
a parallel entity, has traditionally been subject to the
direction of the civilian &quot;sphere.&quot; Indeed, the
military's Commander-in-Chief is a civilian. The Posse Comitatus
Act does no more than prohibit use of military forces to enforce
civilian laws on the territory of the United States. The
Constitution was in existence for approximately a century before
such a law was passed by Congress. The Act has been amended once
since then, and it can be amended again if appropriate.
Furthermore, there is nothing in the laws of the United States
forbidding an active enforcement role by the military outside
United States territory, except the requirement of reimbursement.
This in turn hinges upon the definition of &quot;military
preparedness.&quot; However, nowhere in the debate over the
military's role in this area has this Commission found a
discussion of this term. The definition of the military's role
has been left to the military itself, which, through the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, has declared that the military shall be prepared
to serve national security by providing: </p>

<p>a defense posture capable of successfully resisting hostile or
destructive action from within or without, overt or covert. </p>

<p>As described in Chapter 3 of this report, international drug
traffickers have regularly formed alliances with insurgent and
terrorist forces in certain countries. In a few instances these
alliances may actually threaten friendly governments. In many
more countries such a combination at least drains resources from
constructive goals and inhibits efforts to build or maintain a
stable democracy. Even where the threat is more remote, it is
clear that the smuggling techniques in use are the very same ones
that are or could be used to move personnel, weapons, and other
supplies for insurgent groups. For these reasons alone, the
activities of traffickers should bring them squarely within the
national security concerns of the Department of Defense. This
fact has already been recognized by the Vice President, who has
stated clearly that &quot;success against drug smuggling is
intimately tied to the continuation of freedom and democracy in
the hemisphere.&quot; Recognition of this fact would permit the
Defense Department much greater latitude in conducting military
operations aimed at disrupting trafficking organizations.
Examples of such programs include a wide range of activities,
such as expanded and focused intelligence gathering, security
assistance to receptive host governments, expanded deployment of
tethered aerostat radar sites, and joint research and development
between military and law enforcement agencies to provide greater
operation compatibility. </p>

<p>Beyond threats to friendly democracies, international drug
traffickers should be considered a threat to our national
security because they comprise a direct attack on the physical
and social well-being of our country. The costs of this invasion,
which comes by air, sea, and land, is thoroughly documented in
this report. Recognition of this attack as a &quot;. . .
destructive action from without . . .&quot; which is within the
meaning of the Joint Chiefs' definition, would bring the
Department of Defense squarely into the war in which we presently
find ourselves. This may be further than present policy makers
are prepared to go, but it is surely time to bring the issue into
the debate so that it can be decided on the basis of what is
actually permitted or proscribed by the laws and Constitution of
the United States. </p>

<p>Domestic Investigations and Prosecutions </p>

<p>Domestic investigative and prosecutive activity is only one
facet of drug law enforcement. As with all other approaches
designed to reduce the supply of drugs, proper assessment of
their effectiveness requires that realistic goals be established.
As this report has demonstrated, it is unrealistic to expect that
domestic law enforcement alone will solve, or even substantially
reduce, the Nation's drug abuse problem. Rather, its goal must be
a more limited one: to increase the arrests and successful
prosecutions of drug traffickers, whether they be importers,
wholesalers, or retailers, and those who assist them, including
pilots, bankers, and attorneys, and the forfeiture of their
properties accumulated from criminal activity. </p>

<p>The attainment of this objective would contribute to the
ultimate national policy goal of eliminating drug use in several
ways. First, it would directly reduce the supply of drugs by
removing from the illicit drug market those drugs that are seized
along with the arrested traffickers. Second, it would reduce the
supply of drugs indirectly by disrupting the networks that make
it possible to distribute drugs efficiently. Finally, the
traffickers would likely raise the price of their product to
reflect the increased risks, which theoretically should cause a
reduction in the overall consumption of drugs. </p>

<p>In a recent study prepared by the Rand Corporation the authors
concluded that prevention programs, not intensified domestic law
enforcement, were the best approach to control adolescent drug
use. The Commission agrees with the Rand Corporation's
conclusions concerning adolescent drug use and believes that they
are equally valid with respect to adult drug use. However, such
conclusions should not be interpreted as a call for a reduction
in domestic law enforcement efforts against drug trafficking.
Without effective domestic law enforcement, the drug abuse
problem, and its concomitant organized crime effects, would be
immeasurably worse. </p>

<p>Although domestic law enforcement has a limited, albeit
essential, role to play in the national effort against drug
abuse, the Commission has concluded, on the basis of its
investigations, hearings, and study, that changes in focus and
attitudes and a rearrangement of priorities must be undertaken to
achieve the maximum effect of domestic law enforcement. Before
discussing these matters, it is necessary first to address two
fundamental issues: (1) Do organized crime policy and drug abuse
policy conflict? and (2) What, if any, should be the level of
interaction and cooperation between Federal law enforcement
agencies on the one hand and State and local agencies on the
other? </p>

<p>Professor Mark H. Moore, a former Special Assistant to the
Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, has
described the objectives of U.S. organized crime policy as
follows: </p>

<p>[T]o suppress the provision of illegal goods and services that
constitute the core of organized crime, to prevent the violence
and corruption that is more characteristic of organized crime
groups than other kinds of criminal activity, and to prevent the
emergence of very large, durable organizations with well
developed capacities for violence and corruption. </p>

<p>This Commission believes that the Nation's drug policy must
have as its goal the elimination of illegal drug use. Domestic
law enforcement contributes to this goal by reducing the supply
of drug in the illegal market and by increasing the prices of
drugs that remain available for purchase. It has been suggested
that the pursuit of the Nation's drug policy, without regard for
its impact on organized crime, may exacerbate the country's
organized crime problem by enriching organized crime groups,
eliminating their competitors, and encouraging trafficking
organizations to become organized crime groups if they are not
already. Although agreeing that such a concern is legitimate,
this Commission has concluded that drug and organized crime
policies do not inherently conflict. Indeed, there is
substantial, if not complete, overlap in the goals of the two
policies because, as the Commission has found, drug trafficking
is a principal activity of organized crime groups. In light of
this, the Commission recommends that targeting high-level
organized-crime trafficking groups, whether they be foreign,
multinational or domestic, should be the top priority of Federal
domestic law enforcement. As Professor Moore has stated: </p>

<p>What is not in conflict, however, is the need of both drug
abuse policy and organized crime policy to develop and use
tactics that are successful in attacking large, entrenched
criminal organizations. This is useful to drug policy, and
essential to organized crime policy. </p>

<p>The Commission is aware that some commentators have criticized
the Federal Government's bias in favor of enforcement against
high-level dealers to the virtual exclusion of lower- or
street-level enforcement. However, the Commission's
recommendation that targeting organized crime trafficking groups
should be the top priority of Federal domestic law enforcement
should not be construed to mean that lower-level enforcement is
not useful and therefore has no place in the Nation's drug
policy. On the contrary, such lower-level enforcement is
essential to achieve the goal of eliminating drug use for several
reasons. As discussed earlier, the arrest of the customers of
drug retailers may result in a direct and immediate reduction in
the demand for drugs. In addition, successful enforcement efforts
directed at lower-level dealers will reduce the supply of illegal
drugs and raise the price of drugs available for purchase, thus
resulting in lower drug consumption. Finally, lower-level
enforcement operations are useful in providing information that
will be invaluable to those involved in investigating high-level
organized crime trafficking groups. The absence of vigorous
lower-level domestic law enforcement could encourage organized
crime groups to remain in drug trafficking, and quite possible
spawn more such groups. High-level enforcement efforts could be
crippled, if not completely undermined, by a lack of a
complementary, lower-level effort. </p>

<p>A fundamental question remains: Which agencies should be
responsible for the various facets of domestic law enforcement?
The investigation of high-level organized crime trafficking
groups, whose activities are generally regional, national or
international in scope, is expensive, time consuming, and
requires special skills and sophisticated tools. The Federal
government, through its agencies, is best equipped to undertake
such investigations. State and local agencies, because of their
unique knowledge of local conditions and expertise in the
required techniques, are more qualified to conduct lower-level
domestic law enforcement, including street operations and
investigations of certain smaller and geographically-restricted
trafficking organizations. </p>

<p>The conclusions and recommendations set forth in the preceding
paragraph are not intended to suggest that Federal domestic law
enforcement and that of State and local agencies should be
completely separate and independent. The drug problem facing the
United States is a national one, and the efforts of all law
enforcement agencies must be coordinated and interrelated to some
extent, if we are to deal successfully with the problem. The
required level of cooperation in some instances may be more than
the routine exchange of drug intelligence or the suppression of
interagency rivalries and jurisdictional disputes. In this
regard, the Commission endorses generally the view expressed
recently by a Federal prosecutor concerning drug enforcement
efforts in New York City: </p>

<p>[O]ne can not compartmentalize the narcotics enforcement
effort, and leave the streets entirely to state and local
enforcement and the conspiracy cases entirely to the federal
government. While each may have a primary area, each must do some
of both. The ideal combination may be some federal prosecution of
state and local arrests, and a significant state and local
participation in joint Task Forces, aimed at dismantling of drug
networks through the conspiracy law. </p>

<p>Examples of successful joint ventures involving Federal, State
and local personnel include the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement
Task Force Program, Operation Pressure Point, and the New York
Drug Enforcement Task Force, which was formed in 1970. These
programs can serve as useful models for any future cooperative
domestic law enforcement arrangements that might be needed. </p>

<p>Federal Domestic Law Enforcement </p>

<p>As a result of its investigation and study, the Commission has
concluded that the tools and techniques needed to permit Federal
law enforcement agents to prosecute their portion of the war
against drug traffickers successfully are for the most part
currently available. The need is not for sweeping new legislative
initiatives but for further changes in attitudes and a greater
commitment to cooperation and coordination among the Federal
agencies involved in drug law enforcement. Balkanization and
jurisdictional disputes between agencies are the most serious
obstacles to success in the struggle against drug trafficking.
The personnel of each Federal agency involved in domestic law
enforcement, from the chief executive to the newest employee,
must understand that their agency alone cannot solve the Nation's
drug problem. Acceptance of this reality will go a long way in
eliminating the destructive competition that in the past has
hampered Federal law enforcement. </p>

<p>As discussed above, the Commission has concluded that the
targeting of high-level organized crime trafficking groups should
be the top priority of Federal drug law enforcement efforts.
Because of the sophistication and complexity of such
organizations and their operations, the Federal response must be
equally sophisticated and complex. The Reagan Administration's
establishment of the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force
Program (OCDETF Program) in late 1982 was an attempt to create a
mechanism for attacking high-level organized crime trafficking
groups; by their own account, the multiagency Task Forces,
drawing on the resources of a broad spectrum of Federal, State
and local agencies, have achieved an encouraging degree of
success. The success that has been achieved was not the result of
the development of new techniques but of the efficient use of
existing ones: </p>

<p>The OCDE Task Force Program can lay claim to no new inventions
in the fields of investigative and prosecutorial techniques. It
can, however, be justifiably proud of its creative utilization of
existing tools. </p>

<p>The Commission applauds the OCDETF Program and those who
designed and have implemented it. It strongly favors the
Programs's continuation and expansion, to the extent that it is
desirable and feasible to do so, for several reasons: the Program
has resulted in the elimination of interagency disputes to a
substantial extent; the disruption of large and sophisticated
trafficking groups requires large, efficient and strongly
supported enforcement organizations; and multiagency task forces
are particularly suited to use the Federal conspiracy, Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO), Continuing Criminal
Enterprise (CCE), and forfeiture statutes to the maximum and
optimum extent possible. In addition, the different investigative
techniques used by the participating agencies increases the
probability of successful infiltration of trafficking
organizations. However, the effectiveness of the OCDETF Program
could be enhanced if the following changes were made. </p>

<p>In creating the OCDETF Program, its designers concluded that
to insure the maximum support of the participating agencies, a
consensus-based decision-making process was necessary. In this
regard, no single agency was designated as the lead Task Force
agency. Although participants in the OCDETF Program have been
able to reduce interagency competition and conflict to a
substantial and significant extent, the Commission believe that
further improvement is both desirable and feasible. Such
improvements would flow naturally from a renewed, unambiguous
commitment to the Program and its goals by participating
agencies. Increased cooperation and coordination might also
result, if DEA or the FBI were designated as the lead Task Force
agency, or if the United States Attorneys were given greater
authority with respect to the operations of the Task Force. The
Commission recommends that those in charge of the OCDETF Program
should consider whether a lead agency should be designated or a
U.S. Attorney be given greater authority to achieve even greater
coordination of effort. </p>

<p>Law enforcement agencies that participate in the OCDETF
Program have other missions in the struggle against drug
trafficking. For this reason, each &quot;agency must balance its
commitment to the Task Force concept with its fundamental
mission. Because the targeting of high-level organized crime
trafficking groups should be the top priority and because the
OCDE Task Forces are the best available devices for infiltrating
and disrupting such groups, the Commission is concerned that, in
allocating manpower and other resources between the program and
other missions, the participating agencies should not shortchange
the Task Forces in any way. The top echelon of each participating
agency must be strongly committed to the OCDETF Program and its
goals and must be actively involved in assuring its success. The
required commitment and involvement are not satisfied by
abdicating responsibility for insuring the success of the program
to those heading field offices. Indifference at the headquarters
level will be reflected eventually in field offices. </p>

<p>To signal their commitment to the program and to encourage
their best agents to participate in it, the top executives of
each participating agency should adopt an unambiguous policy that
salary increases and career advancement within the agency for an
agent who participates in an OCDE Task Force will not be
adversely affected in any way by that participation. Such a
policy would require that the evaluation of an agent assigned to
a Task Force be based not on such criteria as the number of
arrests or cases made or the amount of drugs seized. Evaluations
should assess that agent's qualitative performance in complex
financial and conspiracy cases, which may last more than two
years and which may result in the arrest of few, albeit
high-level and important traffickers. </p>

<p>The OCDETF Program is only one facet of the Federal effort
against drug trafficking. The effective functioning of the other
facets of Federal domestic law enforcement, i.e., Organized Crime
Strike Forces, the South Florida Task Force, the FBI, DEA,
Customs, and U.S. Attorneys, is also essential if the Nation's
drug problem is ever to be contained and eventually eliminated. </p>

<p>That the OCDE Task Forces are and should be primarily
responsible for disrupting high-level organized crime trafficking
groups does not mean that the other Federal efforts should be
devoted to, or focused upon, lower -or street-level traffickers
or purely local drug problems. For the reasons discussed above,
these enforcement concerns are rightfully and almost exclusively
those of State and local law enforcement. However, there will be
cases against organized crime trafficking groups that will be
deemed inappropriate for OCDETF treatment, and these will then
have to be handled by some other Federal agency; this is also
true with respect to large trafficking organizations that are not
organized crime controlled and that may or may not be
multi-jurisdictional. </p>

<p>As a result of its investigation and study, the Commission has
concluded that the non-OCDETF Program segments of Federal
domestic drug law enforcement are for the most part functioning
well and that the variety of investigative techniques that these
agencies bring to the Federal effort to reduce the supply of
drugs is a great benefit. The use of financial expertise,
undercover, sting and reverse sting operations, informants,
electronic and other kinds of surveillance, preselected target
and target of opportunity approaches to initiating
investigations, and buy-bust transactions are all useful ways of
infiltrating trafficking organizations. However, the Commission
is concerned that the healthy competition among enforcement
agencies that the current organizational structure is supposed to
encourage often degenerates into jurisdictional conflicts that
harm the overall Federal effort against traffickers. This will
continue to occur unless top agency officials instill in their
agents and employees the sense that genuine cooperation and
coordination with other agencies are essential to the ultimate
success of the Nation's drug effort. In this regard, the National
Drug Enforcement Policy Board has an important and unique role to
play insuring that healthy and constructive competition does not
become destructive and petty conflict. </p>

<p>The Board could take one important step to eliminate
jurisdictional disputes, as well as to avoid duplication of
investigative efforts and to provide maximum safety to drug
agents. This would be to require the establishment of a system
whereby an agency would file a report with a central reporting
repository, once it has opened an investigation of an individual
believed to be a part of a trafficking operation. If two or more
agencies were investigating the same individual, they would be
notified of that fact, and they would be required to decide,
after negotiations, the best way for conducting the
investigation, a single agency or an ad hoc task force. Such a
system would work at its optimal level only if all law
enforcement agencies, including State and local units,
participated. The Commission believes that such a reporting and
control system is highly desirable and, because of existing
technology, feasible. The Commission also believes that this
system could be incorporated easily into the all-source
intelligence and operations center, recommended elsewhere in this
report. </p>

<p>As result of the 1973 reorganization plan, the Customs Service
was prohibited from conducting investigative, intelligence, and
law enforcement functions, relating to the suppression of drug
trafficking, at locations away from ports of entry or borders.
This aspect of the plan has been controversial and as elicited
much criticism on the ground that is weakened the &quot;Nation's
capability to interdict the flow of narcotics into the United
States.&quot; </p>

<p>The Commission has no objections to that feature of the 1973
reorganization plan that created a lead agency in Federal drug
law enforcement, and indeed believes that it remains a valid
concept today. However, the Commission has concluded that it is
an appropriate time to study whether the functions of the Customs
Service with respect to drug trafficking should be expanded to
include investigative, intelligence, and law enforcement
functions within this country, beyond the borders and ports of
entry, where appropriate and subject to the oversight and
supervision of the lead agencies. In this respect, the Commission
notes that the 1973 reorganization plan was modified somewhat
when, on January 5, 1984, the Attorney General signed the
&quot;Request for Assistance and Authorization Respecting Drug
Enforcement Activities of Certain Customs Officers in Domestic
Drug Investigations.&quot; This action granted authority to the
DEA Administrator to endow specific Customs agents, for a
designated period of time, with the power, among others, to
conduct investigative, intelligence, and law enforcement
functions relating to drug trafficking. Because this arrangement
appears to have worked well, a broader expansion of Customs'
functions may be warranted at this time in an effort to improve
domestic law enforcement. </p>

<p>In addition to the attitudinal and organizational matters
discussed above, the Commission proposes substantial expansion of
the use of one particular investigative technique because of the
magnitude of illicit drug production in this country. All of the
PCP (phencyclidine), almost all of the methamphetamine, and an
estimated 80 percent of injectable amphetamine available
illicitly in the United States in 1984 were produced in domestic
clandestine laboratories. In addition, an increasing amount of
cocaine in being processed in this country. In fact, the number
of cocaine laboratories seized by law enforcement authorities in
the United States between 1983 and 1984 nearly doubled. </p>

<p>To combat both the domestic and foreign production of illicit
drugs, law enforcement officials have, in some instances,
targeted the chemicals used to manufacture the drugs. For
example, through its &quot;Operation Chem-Con,&quot; DEA tracks
the movement of chemicals used to process cocaine from the
principal manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers to their final
destinations. According to the chief of the DEA's cocaine
section, Johnny Phelps: </p>

<p>Through cooperation gained by DEA from the world's ether
industry and foreign law enforcement elements, we now have
voluntary restrictions on sales to known trafficking groups and
are able to seize shipments of chemicals after purchase causing
great financial losses to cocaine producing consort[ia]. </p>

<p>In addition to the voluntary compliance of chemical companies
in Operation Chem-Con, reporting requirements are sometimes used
to control chemicals used to manufacture illicit drugs.
Piperidine, a chemical used to manufacture the hallucinogen PCP,
is subject to reporting requirements under the Controlled
Substances Act. The provision requires that any person selling
piperidine report to the Attorney General information concerning
the sale, including identifying information about the purchaser,
and the quantity, form and intended use of the piperidine. This
system has worked well and permits DEA to investigate any
suspicious sales of piperidine. Since 1984 DEA has seized four
clandestine PCP laboratories and has located at least ten other
operations, which obtained chemicals for PCP manufacture by
posing as legitimate businesses. </p>

<p>Chemicals used to manufacture illicit drugs can be regulated
in the same manner as controlled substances. Under the Controlled
Substances Act, the Attorney General may place an immediate
precursor in the same schedule as the controlled substance for
which it is a precursor. </p>

<p>Although the regulation of chemicals used to manufacture
illicit drugs can thwart efforts to produce these drugs and can
help law enforcement officials to locate clandestine
laboratories, several factors limit the effectiveness of such
approaches. First, many of these chemicals have widespread
legitimate uses in industry, and tracking their sales would be
impractical. Even tracking a limited number of these chemicals
would be costly, requiring adequate computer resources and
individuals to review and analyze chemical sales information.
Second, controls on chemicals may have only short-term effects.
In the case of the reporting of piperidine, both use of PCP and
clandestine laboratory activity appeared to decline from 1979 to
1981. However, by 1982, trafficking in and abuse of PCP had
increased. Third, some chemicals can be obtained illicitly. For
example, a shortage of P2P (phenyl-2-propanone), which is used to
manufacture methamphetamine, resulted from the placement of P2P
in Schedule II of the Controlled Substances Act. Traffickers
responded by increasing illicit manufacture of P2P in 1982. </p>

<p>Despite these limitations, controlling a limited number of
these chemicals has merit. The United Nations International
Narcotics Control Board has identified the following chemicals as
suitable targets for control: ether, used to process cocaine;
acetic anhydride, (heroin); P2P, (methamphetamine); ergotamine
(LSD); anthranilic acid (methaqualone); and piperidine (PCP).
This United Nations Board has called on countries in which
illicit drug manufacture occurs to impose a licensing system and
quotas for supplying and importation of these chemicals. </p>

<p>For the foregoing reasons, the Commission recommends that DEA
should determine which chemicals currently used to manufacture
illicit drugs should be subject to reporting requirements or
placed in a schedule of the Controlled Substances Act. This
review should included a consideration of which drugs are most
abused, which have the most serious consequences, and which
precursor chemicals are essential to the production process. In
addition, DEA should identify the resources needed for the
computerization, analysis and follow-up of reports concerning
chemicals selected for monitoring. </p>

<p>The Commission's final recommendations concerning Federal
domestic law enforcement relate to the Federal agents and
employees who are most involved in the Federal effort against
drugs. This country owes these agents the greatest possible
amount of protection and assistance against the vicious and
ruthless participants in organized crime trafficking
organizations. As the testimony of drug pilot Adler Barriman Seal
before this Commission revealed, because of the massive amounts
of money involved, high-level traffickers are able to procure and
use the products of the latest technological advances to
facilitate their trafficking operations. Drug agents must also be
given access to such state of the art equipment and weapons. In
this regard, the research and development operations of Federal
drug law enforcement agencies should work closely with field
agents to produce the equipment and tools needed to defeat drug
traffickers. </p>

<p>Finally, this Commission has made several recommendations
designed to improve Federal domestic law enforcement. However,
the men and women involved in the day-to-day effort against drug
trafficking have the most incentive and are the best qualified to
offer suggestions as to how to improve domestic law enforcement.
These &quot;experts&quot; should be encouraged to make
recommendations and should be rewarded for the ones that are
successful. </p>

<p>State and Local Domestic Law Enforcement </p>

<p>The role of State and local agencies in the national campaign
against drugs has been described above: they have the primary
responsibility for lower- and street-level enforcement because of
their proximity to the affected areas and because they possess or
can adopt the tools necessary for carrying out their mission. The
successful accomplishment of the mission of State and local law
enforcement agencies is a desirable end, in and of itself,
because harassment and disruption of drug retailers and smaller
or geographically-restricted distribution networks could lead to
a reduction in the supply of drugs, an increase in the price of
the drugs remaining in the marketplace, and discouragement of
non-drug users from experimenting with drugs. Successful
completion of this mission will also permit State and local
authorities to provide Federal law enforcement agencies with
information that will be invaluable to the latter in infiltrating
and disrupting high-level organized crime and other large
trafficking organizations. The leaders of State and local
agencies must constantly reiterate to their agents that their
efforts cannot be viewed in isolation and that they are part of
much larger national campaign against drugs. Such indoctrination
will result in the kind of cooperation and coordination essential
to the success of the overall national effort. </p>

<p>Effective State and local domestic drug law enforcement will
undoubtedly require increased expenditures, including the
expansion of prison facilities. Although the drug problem is
quite correctly denominated a National one, its devastating
effects are most pronounced at the State and local levels.
Therefore, the Commission recommends that State and local
governments determine what is necessary to permit their law
enforcement agencies to carry out their drug mission successfully
and do all they can to convince their citizens that any required
increase in expenditures is absolutely essential. Such a campaign
will be considerably more palatable if it includes a large
segment of funding from seized drug revenues and assets, as
described below. </p>

<p>The Commission has concluded that if a State is serious about
responding to the drug problem within its jurisdiction it must
provide its law enforcement agencies with certain tools that are
available to their Federal counterparts. The Commission therefore
recommends that those States, which do not already have such
statutes, consider enacting legislation patterned after the
following Federal statutes: Bail Reform Act of 1984, the
Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act;
statutory use and derivative use immunity for witnesses;
statutory criminal and civil forfeiture provisions; the
Continuing Criminal Enterprise (CCE) statute; Title III of the
Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (electronic
surveillance); and the Currency and Foreign Transactions
Reporting Act. In addition, the Commission recommends that, where
appropriate, States consider adopting statewide grand juries,
with public reporting authority, to improve their investigations
of drug trafficking organizations and eliminating accomplice
corrobation statutes or rules. Although the Commission is
cognizant that there may be legitimate State constitutional
objections to the adoption of some provisions and devices, the
Commission nevertheless believes that each has increased the
effectiveness of Federal domestic law enforcement and would
similarly increase the effectiveness of State and local law
enforcement agencies in infiltrating and disrupting trafficking
groups. </p>

<p>Foreign Assistance </p>

<p>Because the majority of drugs consumed in the United States is
produced abroad, a primary component of our national strategy is
international cooperation to control drugs. A prerequisite of
this strategy is the cooperation of drug producing and
trafficking nations. While this has proved difficult or even
impossible in some situations, due to the political, economic or
social instability of some drug producing countries,
international cooperation can contribute to our national effort
to reduce drug consumption. </p>

<p>The United States provides various forms of assistance to
other countries to help them in their anti-drug efforts,
including both economic and military aid. According to the 1984
National Strategy For Prevention of Drug Abuse and Drug
Trafficking, the objectives of the U.S. international strategy
are: </p>

<p>. . . strengthening U.S. efforts to assist foreign governments
in stopping the production and transportation of illicit drugs
and improving interdiction efforts in transit nations;
encouraging and assisting governments of producer nations to
undertake crop control programs as the most effective means of
curbing production; developing innovative mutual assistance
treaties with foreign governments, directed at facilitating
judicial actions against the drug trade, seizing assets derived
from drug trafficking, eliminating banking procedures which hide
illicit drug transactions, and extradition and other legal
arrangements; encouraging other nations to support international
narcotics control programs, financially and with other resources,
including developmental assistance linked with crop control and
cooperative law enforcement efforts; encouraging international
organizations and development banks to link their assistance with
narcotics control objectives, where appropriate; and curtailing
the diversion of pharmaceuticals and chemicals from legitimate
international commerce. </p>

<p>Indications are increasing that the concern over drug-related
problems is becoming universal. This growing concern is due
largely to recognition by governments in both developed and
less-developed countries, that the illicit production,
trafficking and abuse of drugs pose serious problems to their
nations' development, their societies, and in some cases, to
their national security. The multiple effects of drug trafficking
are increasingly felt in Latin America, Southeast Asia, and
Southwest Asia. These effects include crime, corruption, economic
destabilization, political manipulation, and epidemic drug abuse.
Much of the increased anti-drug activity in South American
countries in the past two years correlates directly to the
emergence of domestic drug problems in those countries, and their
awareness of their own vulnerability to the myriad problems
related to drug abuse. </p>

<p>At a time when drug traffickers rule segments of some
countries, and dominate local economies in others, an increasing
number of nations are realizing that passivity is not the answer.
This realization is encouraging efforts for more cooperation with
the United States in its multilateral enforcement and demand
reduction programs. Reduction in the demand for drugs in the
United States and abroad is beginning to be perceived by drug
producing and trafficking nations as a vital component in the
fight against drug abuse. It is an objective that has greater
long term potential for producing action by source nation
governments than do efforts perceived as benefiting the United
States exclusively. </p>

<p>The Commission recognizes the importance of existing
international drug control efforts. Because drug trafficking and
production are threats to the stability of existing democracies,
a primary goal of the United States and its allies should be to
enhance the security of drug producing and transshipment regions.
Because some source countries are promoting drug control in the
interests of their own national security and public welfare more
actively than they have in the past, it is an opportune time for
the United States to intensify its international drug control
efforts. The success of these efforts requires the political and
financial support of a much broader coalition within the
international community. </p>

<p>The United States offers assistance to numerous countries
around the world with drug abuse and trafficking problems,
primarily through the Department of State's Bureau of
International Narcotics Matters, the Agency for International
Development, and the United States Information Agency. The United
States currently supports crop eradication programs in 14
countries and is working to develop such programs in several
others. These control efforts are vitally enhanced by the public
adareness programs sponsored by the Department of State, the
Agency for International Development, and the United States
Information Agency. </p>

<p>There has been an ongoing debate in this country concerning
the wisdom of making foreign assistance, both general and
drug-related, conditional on the progress of drug control
efforts. Proponents of utilizing existing authority to suspend
aid to any nation not taking steps to control drug production
claim that the United States should employ this leverage as a
final step in forcing nations to stop drug production. Opponents
feel that sustained aid is necessary to achieve U.S.-supported
drug control objectives and that an aid cut-off might undermine
other U.S. interests in some cases. </p>

<p>The National Drug Enforcement Policy Board is now in a central
position in this area, as in all others in the anti-drug effort.
It should carefully evaluate the data used in the President's
annual decision whether to suspend aid to drug producing or
transshipment countries, and make a suitable recommendation to
the President for his ultimate decision. </p>

<p>Extradition and mutual assistance treaties can also contribute
to international drug control efforts by enhancing diplomatic
initiatives and providing leverage in United States' foreign
policy decisions. Clauses in several existing treaties are
particularly innovative and worthy of inclusion in future
agreements. The willingness of a country to engage in and
actively implement drug-related extradition and mutual assistance
treaties should be a primary consideration in ultimate U.S.
policy decisions regarding foreign assistance to a country, and
should be weighed in the deliberations of the President and the
policy Board described above. </p>

<p>The Department of State, in conjunction with the Department of
Defense, should continue its program of expanded economic
assistance with emphasis on assisting those foreign governments
making concerted efforts to control their drug problems. At the
same time, a recognition that drug trafficking has become a
national security issue should lead to the availability and use
of security assistance funds. The effectiveness of such
assistance is, of course, dependent upon the political will of
the host government. To encourage this, the United States should
raise the drug issue to the highest level possible in bilateral
relations with producer and trafficker nations. Similarly, the
United States should raise the drug issue in terns of
international security with its industrialized allies. This
should occur not only in the United Nations, but also on a
bilateral and multilateral basis. This would provide incentive in
urging those nations to increase their assistance and cooperation
within the region and in urging those nations to raise the issue
as a high priority in their bilateral relations with the producer
and trafficking nations. </p>

<p>In addition to these efforts to reduce the supply of drugs,
international efforts to reduce the demand for drugs are an
important component of U.S. strategy. The United States should,
therefore, continue to help producer nations develop prevention
and education programs aimed at drug abuse within the producer
and trafficker nations. </p>

<p>Indications are overwhelming that the world community in
general realizes the dangers inherent in drug use. In the past,
many nations regarded drug abuse as aberrational social behavior,
and relegated governmental reaction, if there was any at all, to
law enforcement or social/health ministries. As international
awareness of the actual nature and scope of the threat of drug
abuse increases, however, nations are placing the issue where it
belongs: within the realm of national security. </p>

<p>Source Country Crop Control </p>

<p>Strategies to control drug trafficking and drug abuse in the
United States have traditionally included measures designed to
eliminate illicit drug supplies at their source. These
&quot;source country eradication&quot; measures, primarily the
manual elimination or uprooting of illicit drug crops and the use
of herbicides to kill illicit plants, remain a central focus of
this country's anti-drug efforts. The 1984 National Strategy for
the Prevention of Drug Abuse and Drug Trafficking clearly states
U.S. policy in this regard: </p>

<p>Fundamental to the overall supply reduction effort is
eliminating illegal drugs as close to their source as possible.
The major gains will be realized in the longer term reduction in
the availability of illicit drugs. </p>

<p>Since 1978 the Department of State's Bureau of International
Narcotics Matters (BINM) has had primary responsibility for
overseeing and implementing foreign drug production control
efforts. BINM provides bilateral assistance for crop control and
interdiction programs in drug source countries in the form of
equipment, training and technical advisory services. BINM's
stated objective is: </p>

<p>to control production simultaneously in all key sectors of
illicit drugs exported to the United States so that significant
and lasting reductions in availability are achieved . . . .
Preventing cultivation and destroying illicit narcotics at their
source will prove to be the most effective means of reducing
availability. . . . BINM's first priority is on crop control -
government bans on cultivation production, enforced by manual or
chemical crop eradication. </p>

<p>In a successful crop control system drugs would be stopped at
their source, thereby alleviating the &quot;chain reaction&quot;
associated with drug trafficking and drug abuse in this country.
In fact, crop reduction efforts have at best enjoyed limited
success. Despite the fact that nearly all drug producing and
transit countries are signatories to a 1961 agreement that
restricts production and distribution of certain drugs to only
medical and scientific uses, drug production has escalated in
most source countries in the past 20 years. Increased production
has resulted in decreased prices and wider availability of most
illicit drugs in the United States. Accordingly, domestic
consumption of many drugs has increased. </p>

<p>The effectiveness of efforts to control illicit drug crops in
source countries is inherently limited. First, many source
country governments are not motivated to reduce crop production,
either because the profits obtained from the illicit crops are
essential to the economic and/or political stability of the
country, or because they view drug consumption as an exclusively
American problem. In addition, many drugs that are illegal in the
United States are traditionally consumed in milder forms by
source country natives and are viewed as necessities of life or
an essential part of their culture. </p>

<p>Secondly, in many cases farmers do not have an easily
available alternative crop. In any case, an illicit drug crop can
provide a farmer with far more income than any legitimate crop
and is therefore likely to be selected above any other crop for
cultivation. </p>

<p>Third, the governments in many producing areas are weak and do
not exert control over growers. The Thai and Burmese governments
have long been fighting insurgent groups in the Northwest
Frontier Provinces, where most of the Golden Triangle opium is
grown. The Peruvian government has had little effective control
in remote coca producing regions controlled by that country's
Shining Path Guerrillas. Even where governments aggressively
pursue crop eradication programs, difficulties are sometimes
overwhelming. </p>

<p>Fourth, some major source countries are controlled by
governments hostile to the United States, who while adopting
policies to reduce domestic consumption, have no hesitation about
importation of illicit drugs to the United States. Because many
source country governments are politically and economically
unstable, United States diplomatic relations with even nonhostile
source country governments are often very complex. </p>

<p>Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the set of source
countries is not fixed. When a crop is successfully reduced in
one country, production begins or increases in another country.
New producers constantly emerge. This shifting has been observed
repeatedly throughout the history of source country control
efforts, even where the United States has claimed major crop
eradication successsses. This has been the most serious obstacle
to total crop reduction efforts. </p>

<p>U.S. and Mexican efforts provide an example. The crop
eradication program conducted in the mid-1970's in Mexico is
often cited as a successful model. Through the program, the
United States supplied equipment, herbicide and funds for the
eradication of opium poppies, primarily in Northern Mexico. While
Mexican heroin production declined after the program's
implementation, heroin production in and export from the Golden
Triangle and the Golden Crescent accelerated, and within five
years, total heroin available in the United States reached levels
equal to those attained before the Mexican eradication program.
Mexican heroin production has increased every year since 1980,
and in 1984 that country provided an estimated 21 percent of the
total U.S. supply. </p>

<p>Despite the limitations of source country control programs,
the efforts to reduce international illicit drug crops are
essential to the overall U.S. drug strategy. Implemented
selectively and judiciously, crop control programs could
effectively reduce the availability of targeted illicit drugs in
the United States, if only on a temporary basis. As viewed by the
Select Committee on Narcotics, </p>

<p>Effective action in relatively few countries, against the
production and trafficking of opium, heroin, coca, cocaine,
marijuana and hashish would have a great impact on the drug abuse
problem in the United States by dramatically curtailing supplies
available to users and potential users . . . </p>

<p>The United States, through the Department of State, should
focus crop control efforts in those countries where political and
economic climates will make the success of crop eradication
programs probable. Particular crop control opportunities could
best be determined if the State Department established a cadre of
professional drug officers. Currently, international drug
programs are often managed by contract personnel or by Foreign
Service Officers not especially interested in drug issues.
Narcotics Assistance Unit positions within the Foreign Service
often remain unfilled for long periods of time because Foreign
Service Officers often view them as a detriment to their careers.
The absence of a specialized drug group within the Foreign
Service structure thus impacts negatively on the overall
international drug effort. The Department of State should
recognize Narcotics Assistance Unit positions as priority
assignments, and integrate them into the career advancement
structure. </p>

<p>BINM should also examine the possibility of introducing source
country farmers to more imaginative and feasible alternatives to
illicit drug cultivation. The available options are currently
limited to cultivating licit replacement crops but could possibly
include the mining of indigenous minerals and the introduction of
light industry to a traditional growing region. </p>

<p>Finally, the importance of international crop controls in the
context of the overall drug reduction strategy should be
reevaluated. The limitations inherent in these programs, the
majority of which are beyond the control of the United States,
make them a less likely success than other strategies discussed
elsewhere in this report. In addition, the problems associated
with international controls, most notably the relentless shifting
of drug crop cultivations to non-targeted countries, underscores
the ultimate importance of reducing the demand for drugs in this
country. History has shown that as long as consumer demand for an
illicit drug is strong, some country, somewhere, will become a
source country.<br>

<h1>America's Habit </h1>

<h2>Drug Abuse, Drug Trafficking, &amp; Organized Crime </h2>

<p><b>President's Commission on Organized Crime, 1986 </b></p>

<hr>

<h2>Chapter VII Reducing the Demand for Drugs </h2>

<p>The Limitations of Tactics Affecting Supply </p>

<p>Traditionally, efforts to reduce the trafficking and abuse of
illicit drugs in this country have been based on the theory that
significant reductions of drug supplies would lead to equal
reductions in drug-related problems. While this seems plausible,
a review of the 75-year history of these efforts reveals that
they have not reduced social, economic or crime problems related
to drugs. Despite continuing expressions of determination,
America's war on drugs seems nowhere close to success. Now more
than ever, drugs present problems of vast proportions. </p>

<p>This does not suggest that efforts to reduce supply, such as
crop eradication, border interdiction, and prosecution, have
failed. To the contrary, they have achieved a measure of success.
In 1983, for example, authorities estimated that approximately 10
percent of the drugs destined for illicit markets were
interdicted. Crop eradication programs were significantly
expanded in Colombia, where most of the world's cocaine is
processed and nearly one-half of the marijuana consumed in the
United States is grown. In addition, indictments and convictions
of some of the world's most notorious traffickers have been
obtained in recent years. </p>

<p>Despite these efforts, American consumption of cocaine
increased an estimated 12 percent and dangerous drug use
increased an estimated 15 percent between 1983 and 1984. Cocaine,
heroin, amphetamine, and methamphetamine-related deaths
increased, as did cocaine, PCP, and methamphetamine-related
emergency room visits. </p>

<p>In short, strategies to reduce supply are &quot;working&quot;
by some standards, but only to a limited degree. </p>

<p>Although some inherent factors limit the effectiveness of
these tactics, the overwhelming and continuing demand for illicit
drugs among Americans is the primary cause of their limited
success. Millions want illicit drugs and are willing to violate
the law, spend billions of dollars, and in many cases risk their
lives to obtain them. </p>

<p>Supply Versus Demand </p>

<p>Although the supply of and demand for drugs have often been
considered separate issues, by both the public and private
sectors, they are in fact inseparable parts of a single problem.
The success of supply efforts are related to commitments made to
reduce the demand for drugs through drug abuse education,
treatment, research, vigorous enforcement of drug abuse laws, and
effective sentencing. Drug supply and demand operate in an
interrelated and dynamic manner. The strategies employed to limit
each should be similarly connected. </p>

<p>The national fight against illicit drugs relies on two
fundamental strategies: organized crime policy and drug abuse
policy. Organized crime policy targets specific criminal groups
and seeks to destroy those already in existence and prevent the
emergence of new ones. In contrast, drug abuse policy attempts to
reduce drug use and its associated adverse effects.
Theoretically, organized crime policy and drug abuse policy can
conflict. Reducing the demand for drugs advances the goals of
both organized crime policy and drug abuse policy. A
significantly smaller drug market, which would likely result from
a substantially reduced demand for drugs, would attack organized
crime groups by limiting the huge profits currently available in
drug trafficking, while simultaneously reducing the number of
drug users, the goal of drug abuse policy. </p>

<p>A clear example of the relationship of supply and demand is
provided by the case of heroin trafficker Cecily Lermusiaux, who
with several associates, moved heroin into an area of Las Vegas
where its use among &quot;middle to high-class whites&quot; was
previously unknown. In a scheme which began with the distribution
of free samples of heroin, Lermusiaux's independent heroin
business generated a profit of several million dollars in
approximately six years. </p>

<p>The demand for drugs is also widely recognized as the fuel
that the illicit drug industry needs to operate. According to
Colombian President Belisario Bentancur: </p>

<p>In the world war against narcotics, we need the commitment of
the consumer nations to attack the traffic with the same vigor we
have shown. We can make all the sacrifices possible, but if there
is enormous demand, production will never be completely
eradicated. </p>

<p>This sentiment has been echoed by the other side of the law.
Carlos Lehder, who heads one of Colombia's most notorious cocaine
cartels, sees the American demand for drugs as the driving force
behind the &quot;bonanza&quot; of drug trafficking: </p>

<p>The demand for drugs in the United States is so great that the
producer countries like Colombia play a really tiny role compared
to the total consumption of the United States. </p>

<p>Tactics to Reduce Demand </p>

<p>Efforts to reduce demand are not hampered by international
political complications, or other factors that limit the
effectiveness of tactics to reduce supply. This Commission is of
the opinion that since reducing demand is the single policy
option pursuable entirely within our own borders, it deserves
greater attention. </p>

<p>More successful tactics to reduce demand may in the long-run
decrease the need for current high levels of funding for
approaches to reduce supply. A significant reduction in the
demand for drugs as a complement to aggressive enforcement
efforts is likely to make drug trafficking less lucrative for
organized crime and thus prompt many organized crime groups to
drop out of the drug business. According to analyst Mark Kleiman:
</p>

<p>Demand reduction is clearly the strategy of choice with
respect to its effects on organized crime . . . anything that
tends to depress demand will reduce both trafficking-related
ancillary crime and the level of drug enforcement resources
needed to attain any given level of reduction in drug
consumption. </p>

<p>Skeptics have argued that past tactics to reduce demand have
not been successful. However, the history of drug abuse
prevention and treatment programs has been relatively short. It
was not until the upsurge of drug use in the 1960's that these
programs developed. Some early prevention approaches were
ill-conceived. For example, they often presented information
about drugs without persuasive arguments to deter their use, and
other programs used exaggerated information. Such programs have
been criticized for unintentionally encouraging experimentation
with drugs or squandering the credibility of anti-drug
information. The most recent and effective drug abuse education
and prevention programs focus on the psychological and
sociological factors that contribute to the onset of drug use.
Drug education programs must be continually evaluated and
improved to keep pace with changing drug abuse patterns. </p>

<p>In a model program, the National Institute on Drug Abuse
(NIDA) used the strategy of the anti-smoking campaigns of the
late 1970's, which many feel were effective, to develop its
&quot;Just Say No&quot; campaign against drug use which
recognizes the impact of social pressure. NIDA seeks to show
adolescents through a music video, television commercials, and
other media that they can turn down drugs by simply saying
&quot;no&quot; to them. </p>

<p>While it is difficult to measure precisely the effectiveness
of such anti-drug advertising, it is clear that the media can
help shape attitudes. Just as beliefs about cigarette smoking
have changed in recent years, so too can attitudes about drugs.
Anti-drug advertising has an advantage over the anti-smoking
campaigns: drug dealers cannot openly advertise their product.
According to the New York advertising firm of Trout and Ries, </p>

<p>Unlike cigarette manufacturers, drug producers and sellers
cannot use advertising to promote a fashionable image for their
drugs. Quite the opposite, the government can use advertising to
make drugs less and less fashionable to use. This, if America
runs true to form, will dramatically reduce demand. When it's
'out' in America, it doesn't sell. </p>

<p>Reducing the demand for drugs requires a long-term commitment
because it takes time to change attitudes. This commitment must
be made by Federal, State, and local governments and the private
sector. Each must unequivocally reassert that any and all illicit
drug use is unacceptable in light of the effects of drugs on
individuals, families, communities, and governments. It is only
in this context that a war against drugs that seeks to limit both
the supply of and demand for drugs can be effective. </p>

<p>Federal Government </p>

<p>Federal Priorities </p>

<p>Three of the five elements of the current National Strategy
for Prevention of Drug Abuse and Drug Trafficking are directed to
reduction of demand: drug abuse prevention, medical
detoxification and treatment, and research. </p>

<p>The importance of reducing demand has, in addition, been,
publicly acknowledged by leading law enforcement officials.
According to Attorney General Edwin Meese III, for example: </p>

<p>All the enforcement efforts that we can try in this country,
all the police agencies in this nation and worldwide will never
be able to stem the supply of drugs in this nation until we have
first decreased the number of users and have decreased the demand
for these drugs. </p>

<p>John Lawn, administrator of the Drug Enforcement
Administration (DEA), concurs: </p>

<p>Were we [DEAl to increase dramatically in size, the drug
problem would continue to exist until we could do something about
demand reduction. </p>

<p>While the importance of strategies to reduce demand has been
acknowledged, it is reduction of supply that has consumed the
bulk of the Federal drug abuse budget. This may be due, in part,
to the fact that certain enforcement operations are inherently
more expensive, and they are exclusively a Federal function. In
addition, primary responsibility for developing and maintaining
programs to reduce demand has been shifted to the States and the
private sector. </p>

<p>The concept of our current National Strategy, assigning
complementary roles to the Federal government, on the one hand,
and State and local governments and the private sector, on the
other, is commendable for its recognition of the unique roles of
each component. However, the adoption of this coordinated
approach carries with it the responsibility for ensuring that the
components perform in a truly coordinated and complementary
fashion. There is insufficient evidence today that this
responsibility is being met. Moreover, in precisely the same way
that approaches to reduce supply recognize a unique Federal
capability, there are certain functions in the area of demand
that, by their nature, can only be performed by the Federal
government. The Federal government's exclusive role in reducing
the demand for drugs includes providing national coordination in
the conduct of research, gathering nationwide data, and
developing and disseminating standards for drug prevention and
treatment programs across the country. </p>

<p>Current budgetary figures reflect the emphasis on drug law
enforcement. while programs to reduce demand at one time received
the larger share of the Federal budget, the focus on enforcement
has increased dramatically during the last decade. For example,
between fiscal year 82 and 86, Federal funding for drug abuse
prevention has decreased by 5 percent, while Federal funding for
drug law enforcement has increase by 70 percent. For fiscal year
1986 Federal expenditures on drug law enforcement constitute 84
percent of the total Federal drug abuse budget outlay of $1.7
billion. Interdiction alone consumes 38 percent of this budget.
In the same year Federal funding for drug abuse prevention
constitutes one percent, treatment and rehabilitation 6 percent,
and research 4 percent of the total Federal drug abuse budget. </p>

<p>In addition to this funding the Federal government provides
funding to the States for drug abuse prevention and treatment
through the Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Block Grants.
For fiscal year 1986 between $65 and $244 million is made
available to the States for drug programs. However, prior to 1981
under the formula grant program, 40 percent more funds were
available to the States for these purposes. A thorough review of
the current budgetary allotments for anti-drug efforts, now
contemplated by the National Drug Enforcement Policy Board,
should be placed at the top of the agenda of the Board
immediately. This Commission concludes that such a review will
indicate that greater Federal resources should be devoted to
programs to reduce demand, and that the Board should pursue
appropriate action without hesitation. </p>

<p>Asset Forfeiture </p>

<p>Expanded efforts to reduce demand would, of course, require
additional funding at all levels. A particularly promising source
of such funding is the considerable amount of money and property
obtained annually through forfeiture and seized by law
enforcement officials. In 1984 Federal agencies obtained an
estimated $400 to 450 million through the forfeiture and seizure
of drug traffickers assets. Rudolph Guiliani, U.S. Attorney for
the Southern District of New York, observes: </p>

<p>The drug dealers are just about paying for the drug law
enforcement, and hopefully we can get them to pay for drug
education. </p>

<p>Under current policy, the Federal government channels all
seized and forfeited assets into Federal, State, and local law
enforcement agencies and the Department of Justice Assets
Forfeiture Fund. Presently, no portion of these funds is used for
Federal drug demand reduction programs, such as prevention,
treatment, and research. However, pending legislation is being
considered that would direct use of portions of the Assets
Forfeiture Fund for drug abuse prevention and treatment programs.
A portion of the Federal government's asset forfeiture fund
derived from drug cases should be devoted to programs to reduce
demand in whatever proportion is indicated by the Policy Board's
budgetary review. Funding to reduce demand should include a
responsible contribution to the States for their own programs in
this area. However, any funding directed to the States should be
made contingent upon their vigorous pursuit of such programs, and
after a reasonable grace period, funding should be denied to any
State failing this requirement. Failure to enact State electronic
surveillance measures and asset forfeiture provisions, with the
proceeds thereof directed to anti-drug programs, should
constitute per se failure. </p>

<p>Research </p>

<p>Because data concerning drug abuse are in many instances
relatively incomplete, and in all cases, subject to change based
on new discoveries, continuing research is a fundamental
component of any drug strategy. Recent discoveries concerning
cocaine provide an example. The 1967 President's Commission on
Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice reported that
cocaine did not &quot;create tolerance or physical
dependence;&quot; however, research during the 1980's showed that
cocaine does, in fact, create tolerance and some argue, physical
dependence. Despite this increased understanding about cocaine,
many experts, such as Dr. Arnold Washton, argue that research
about the effects of cocaine is still in its &quot;infancy.&quot;
</p>

<p>Continuing research is required not only by the complex nature
of drugs and their effects on the human mind and body, but also
by the constantly shifting patterns of drug abuse. While heroin
has traditionally been the most frequently encountered drug of
abuse among individuals in treatment programs, cocaine now
follows closely behind and has, in fact, overtaken heroin as the
primary drug of abuse by those in treatment in 18 States. While
requests for treatment by cocaine users are estimated to have
increased by as much as 600 percent in the last three years,
research about cocaine and its effects has not kept pace with
this growing problem. The development of new drugs, such as
controlled substance analogs, presents another compelling need
for continuing research. </p>

<p>Data Collection and Dissemination </p>

<p>As part of its research responsibilities, NIDA supports two
continuing epidemiological surveys, the National Household Survey
on Drug Abuse and the High School Senior Survey. While these two
surveys provide valuable information about the extent of drug
use, neither NIDA nor any other agency systematically collects or
disseminates information about the thousands of drug abuse
programs. </p>

<p>State governments, which disbursed 46 percent ($642.5 million)
of the funding for alcohol and drug abuse prevention and
treatment services in fiscal year 1984, do not systematically
report to the Federal government about these programs. This lack
of data is due primarily to the absence of any statutory
requirement for such reporting, and is a major obstacle to
effective drug policy planning. The States should be required to
report to the National Institute on Drug Abuse information about
their prevention and treatment programs. With this information,
and reports obtained from private programs, NIDA will be better
able to identify the best prevention and treatment programs and
to develop and disseminate standards and guidelines for such
programs to the States. The States should, in turn, provide this
information to all groups engaged in prevention, treatment, and
related research. </p>

<p>Guidelines </p>

<p>Because the Federal government does not systematically collect
and evaluate information about drug abuse prevention and
treatment programs, it cannot develop substantive guidelines for
such efforts. The history of drug abuse prevention has
demonstrated that certain approaches are considerably more
effective than others. Some have even unwittingly encouraged
experimentation with drugs. As an increasing number of school and
community-based prevention programs are created, the need for
guidelines for drug abuse programs is particularly acute.
Officials at NIDA acknowledge that many programs use outdated
factual information and philosophies; however, the Federal
government is in a unique position to establish and disseminate
such guidelines to improve both State and private sector drug
abuse programs. Its current failure to do so is a major
deficiency in the campaign against drug abuse. </p>

<p>In addition to contributions to reducing the demand for drugs
through research, data collection and dissemination, and the
formation of guidelines, the Federal government should provide an
example of the unacceptability of drug use. The President should
direct the heads of all federal agencies to formulate immediately
clear policy statements, with implementing guidelines, including
suitable drug testing, expressing the utter unacceptability of
drug use by Federal employees. Government contracts should not be
awarded to companies which fail to implement drug programs,
including suitable drug testing. </p>

<p>State and Local Governments </p>

<p>State and local governments are key components in the national
campaign against drug abuse. Their unique capabilities in the
area of reducing demand include State-sponsored media campaigns
against drug use, prevention and education programs in the
schools, drug treatment programs, more vigorous enforcement of
State drug laws, and the inclusion of mandatory treatment or jail
sentences, as appropriate, for those individuals convicted of
possession of drugs. Because the nature of drug use tends to vary
among different geographical areas, State and local governments
are best positioned to tailor techniques to reduce demand to suit
their particular drug problem. </p>

<p>Drug Education </p>

<p>The public school systems of State and local governments
provide an appropriate forum for drug abuse prevention programs.
Consistent with identified measures of success, State governments
should establish credentialing standards for prevention and
treatment programs. They should further require that all
elementary, junior high, and high schools within the State
include drug abuse prevention programs in their curricula,
designed in a manner consistent with such credentialing
standards. State funding should be made available to assure the
proper training of educators assigned to such programs. </p>

<p>Combining prevention programs, clear school policies about the
consequences of drug use, increased discipline, and higher
academic standards has been demonstrated to be effective. For
example, Northside High School in Atlanta, Georgia implemented
such a program in the late 1970's in the face of &quot;poor
academic performance . . . student apathy . . . discipline
problems . . . class cutting and open drug use on campus.&quot;
By the early 1980's, performance on standardized tests improved
significantly and &quot;the use and possession of drugs on campus
[had] all but disappeared.&quot; Every employer, public and
private, and public education institutions at all levels should
have clearly-stated policies prohibiting drug use, possession of
drugs, or being under the influence of drugs on their premises.
The consequences of violating these prohibitions should be
clearly explained. </p>

<p>Law Enforcement </p>

<p>A critical part of a national campaign to reduce demand is
vigorous enforcement by State and local governments of their laws
regarding the possession of controlled substances. The Department
of Justice Uniform Crime Report for 1984 states that 552,552
arrests were made in 1984 by State and local police agencies for
possession of drugs. Given that in 1984 there were estimated to
be 20 million monthly marijuana users, over four million monthly
cocaine users, and approximately 520,000 heroin addicts, it is
clear that the statistical probability of arrest for possession
was and is quite low. This low probability of arrest vitiates in
large part whatever deterrent value laws against drug possession
and use may have. </p>

<p>In addition to increasing the likelihood of arrest for drug
possession, punishment for those convicted of such offenses can
be more effective. Drug users are not &quot;victims&quot; who
bear no responsibility for their actions. Imprisonment for
recidivists provides both deterrent value and an opportunity to
break the cycle of drug use. Uniform and rational sentencing for
drug offenses is essential. Such a system should provide a
sentence of probation and a fine for a first offense involving
possession of drugs. The terms of probation should include a
requirement to remain drug-free, to be verified through periodic
drug testing. A second offense for possession of drugs should
result in a jail sentence or mandatory treatment, if appropriate,
or fines or all three. The results of random drug screening
should be used in considering parole in cases of both drug
possession and trafficking. </p>

<p>Society's commitment to the unacceptability of illicit drug
use is properly expressed in vigorous enforcement of the laws
regarding possession of drugs and sentencing of recidivist users
to jail terms and mandatory treatment. Such a national commitment
is in conflict with various States' relaxation of criminal
penalties for the possession of marijuana. Because such measures
were based on limited information and popular misinformation
about the effects of marijuana, it is appropriate for those
States that reduced these penalties during the 1970's to
reconsider these laws. This reconsideration is warranted,
especially in light of a Federal campaign against marijuana
smuggling and the considerable evidence that a substantial share
of marijuana trafficking is dominated by organized crime groups,
which are both ruthless and involved in smuggling other drugs. In
addition, the sale of drug paraphernalia undermines this Nation's
anti-drug efforts. States that have not already done so should
enact and enforce laws prohibiting the sale of drug
paraphernalia. </p>

<p>Reducing demand and increased enforcement of drug possession
laws will undoubtedly place a greater burden on our courts and
will generate the need for more jail cells and treatment
facilities. The accompanying increase in expenditures, however,
could be met in part with funding extracted from the illicit drug
industry itself. All 50 States currently authorize forfeiture of
assets in connection with drug trafficking and manufacturing,
making available millions of dollars in cash and property each
year to State governments. </p>

<p>The Private Sector: Attitudes and Actions </p>

<p>The hostess who is certain enough of her own unwillingness to
tolerate pot smoking in her home doesn't need to call the cops to
keep her guests from lighting up. </p>

<p>&quot;Great scent. Lousy name.&quot; - Advertising Age, a
trade journal commenting on &quot;Opium,&quot; a popular perfume
marketed by Charles of the Ritz, a subsidiary of Squibb
Pharmaceuticals. </p>

<p>Drug abuse is fundamentally a social problem, which cannot be
solved by the government alone. Federal and State governments can
support drug abuse prevention and treatment programs, conduct
research, enforce drug laws and provide leadership in the fight
against drug abuse and drug trafficking. However, not until
public and individual attitudes change will illicit drugs and the
organized criminal groups that traffic in them be eliminated.
Individuals need not accept drug use in their midst. There is no
&quot;right&quot; to use drugs. Government efforts to combat drug
trafficking and drug abuse are a vital effort, but they are
ultimately only a holding action, while consensus continues to
build among individuals concerning the utter unacceptability of
drug use. </p>

<p>Despite this growing consensus, a profound disparity exists
between principle and practice. Popular entertainment arid
advertising, sometimes subtle, sometimes not, regularly reflects
and even promotes the view that the use of illicit drugs is
glamorous, exciting, and sophisticated, or at least harmless and
amusing. </p>

<p>The illusion that drug use is glamorous is regularly, if
somewhat indirectly, reinforced by revelations that drug use is
commonplace among celebrities in the sports and entertainment
worlds. In August 1985, for example, the New York Times reported
cocaine's alleged use by players on virtually every team in the
major leagues, prompting the Commissioner of Baseball to declare
drug use the &quot;number one&quot; problem facing the game. </p>

<p>It is even possible to find purportedly responsible groups
urging not only recognition but acceptance of drug use as a
feature of daily life. An article in the January/February 1984
issue of Social Work, the journal of the National Association of
Social Workers, prescribes the following for adolescent marijuana
use: </p>

<p>Use should be moderate . . no more than four to five joints
per week seem advisable. </p>

<p>Such acceptance of drug use may be shared by many who resign
themselves to the fact that drug abuse is inevitable. Such a view
reflects a failure of will on the part of the American public.
American society may view drug use in the abstract as wrong, and
many People agree that heroin addicts who commit additional
crimes to support their drug habits should be jailed. However,
many people react with ambivalence to the drug use in their
midst. Even while the United States government spends almost a
billion and one-half dollars on drug law enforcement, threatens
to cut off foreign aid to drug producing countries, and
extradites and imprisons foreign nationals on trafficking
charges, we appear to lack the same degree of resolve to hold
this country's drug users, as well as those who directly or
indirectly promote drug use, accountable for their actions and
the consequences thereof. </p>

<p>While attitudes are ultimately an individual matter, actions
need not be. It is in combination with others that private
citizens have been most effective in combatting drug abuse. As
discussed earlier, athletes, entertainers, manufactures,
advertisers and media can promote drug use by their individual
examples or by favorable portrayals of drug use. However, these
elements of society also have the power to shape different public
attitudes about drug use by presenting the truth about drugs. The
media and entertainment industries should carefully review their
portrayals of drug use and its consequences and ensure their
accuracy. </p>

<p>Efforts to combat drug abuse can also be successful in the
workplace. Many businesses across the country have Employee
Assistance Programs (EAPs), which seek to prevent drug abuse at
the worksite and which offer treatment and referrals. In
addition, many businesses now test employees or prospective
employees for drug use. According to a survey of 100 Fortune 500
companies, two-thirds refuse to hire job applicants who fail such
tests, 25 percent fire employees and 41 percent require treatment
for employees who fail. Drug testing protects businesses, which
lose billions of dollars each year in reduced productivity as a
result of drug use, employees, and the public. Drug testing in
certain &quot;critical positions,&quot; such as in the
transportation industry, law enforcement, and education is
particularly important. </p>

<p>In addition to efforts in the workplace to combat drug abuse,
health professionals, such as physicians, nurses, psychologists,
and social workers can help identify and treat drug users.
However, currently formal training in the diagnosis and treatment
of drug abuse is limited. Health professionals should be
thoroughly trained to identify and counsel drug abusers. </p>

<p>Decisions to use or not to use drugs are ultimately derived
from values that are best inculcated and reinforced in families,
churches, civic organizations, schools and local communities. The
efforts of organizations, which seek to help families prevent
drug use, such as the National Federation of Parents for
Drug-Free Youth, are essential to the fight against drug use and
drug trafficking. First Lady Nancy Reagan has made an important
contribution to this effort to reduce the demand for drugs.
Relying on the task force approach which law enforcement
officials have used successfully, parents, churches, schools,
civic organizations, and business associations should form
community task forces in every community across the country to
provide a unified front against drugs.<br>

<h1>America's Habit </h1>

<h2>Drug Abuse, Drug Trafficking, &amp; Organized Crime </h2>

<p><b>President's Commission on Organized Crime, 1986 </b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<h2>Chapter VIII Summary of Recommendations </h2>

<p>Based on its findings and the extended analysis, found
elsewhere in the report, (primarily in Chapters VI and VII), the
Commission makes the following recommendations: </p>

<p>General Recommendations </p>

<p>1. The ultimate goal of the Nation's drug policy is the
effective suppression of drug abuse in the United States. While
efforts to reduce the supply of drugs in this country, such as
interdiction and source country crop controls, indirectly advance
this goal, efforts to reduce the demand for drugs can make a more
direct contribution. For this reason, the Nation's drug policy
must emphasize more strongly efforts to reduce the demand for
drugs. </p>

<p>2. Because drug trafficking and abuse are the most serious
organized crime problems in America today, they must be addressed
at the highest levels of government. Therefore, the National Drug
Enforcement Policy Board (Board), under the direction of the
Attorney General, is and should continue to be responsible for
this country's drug policy. The mandate of the Board should be
interpreted, or expanded if necessary, to require the Board to
coordinate carefully efforts to reduce both drug demand and
supply to achieve this ultimate goal. The Board should evaluate
all programs undertaken pursuant to the national drug strategy in
terms of their contribution to this goal. In recognition of the
scope of the problem of international drug trafficking and the
extended national effort needed to combat it, the Attorney
General, as Chairman of the National Drug Enforcement Policy
Board, should depart from the current formulation of a National
Strategy on an annual basis, directing instead the formulation of
a long range national offensive against drug supply and demand,
including long term funding proposals. Such a program should
include an appropriate role for State and local agencies as a
complement to Federal efforts. State and local police agencies
should be trained and equipped to perform such a role. </p>

<p>3. The rigorous pursuit of the Nation's drug policy, as
proposed in this report, will not undermine its organized crime
policy. Indeed, the goals of the two policies substantially
overlap and therefore both can and must be implemented
simultaneously and aggressively. </p>

<p>4. The cost of this Nation's anti-drug efforts can be
subsidized to a great extent by the seizure and forfeiture of
drug traffickers' assets. That portion of the Federal
government's asset forfeiture fund derived from drug cases should
be devoted exclusively to anti-drug programs. Such a funding
mechanism should be made permanent through law, and the current
ceiling of $10 million should be eliminated. In the annual
Congressional appropriations process, these funds should be
allocated to participating agencies according to Congressional
findings, just as if the funds were appropriated. </p>

<p>5. Because of the international dimensions of drug
trafficking, the United Nations, in performance of its leadership
role in the international community, should sponsor the drafting
and promotion of a model International Controlled Substances Act,
identifying each and every drug which is trafficked to the
detriment of any single member nation. This model act should be
accompanied by a Model Mutual Legal Assistance and Extradition
Treaty, embodying the recognition that international drug
trafficking is a matter of profound international concern. In the
spirit of international cooperation, the Attorney General, as
Chairman of the National Drug Enforcement Policy Board, should
direct the creation of bilateral working groups, modeled on the
present Italian-American Working Group. </p>

<p>Interdiction </p>

<p>1. Within the overall structure of the National Drug
Enforcement Policy Board (the Board), the Vice President's role
as leader and coordinator of interdiction efforts should be
recognized, maintained, and strengthened. </p>

<p>2. A proper and realistic goal of our interdiction efforts
should be the maintenance of persistent pressure on drug
traffickers, both as a deterrent and as a symbol of national
determination. Operational and policy decisions should reflect
that measure of su cess and specifically reject any less
realistic or effective goal. </p>

<p>3. Both Congress and the Board should carefully evaluate the
technical capabilities and equipment of drug smugglers. To the
extent that law enforcement agencies' capabilities and equipment
are inferior to those of drug traffickers, immediate steps should
be taken to rectify the situation. </p>

<p>4. All Federal agencies having any responsibility for the
regulation of air, sea, or land travel into or out of the United
States should review their policies and practices and ensure that
no purpose other than the promotion of public safety is given
priority over the effort to combat drug trafficking. To this end,
the proposed &quot;Customs Enforcement Act of 1985&quot; should
be enacted promptly. </p>

<p>5. The Policy Board should carefully examine the regulatory
practices of the Federal Aviation Administration, particularly in
the field of aircraft modification, to determine whether
possibilities exist for more aggressive anti-smuggling efforts.
In addition, the Policy Board should carefully monitor the design
of the Federal Aviation Administration's approach radar system to
ensure that interdiction capabilities and opportunities are
maximized. </p>

<p>6. Diplomatic initiatives should be pursued immediately to
facilitate Customs pursuit of suspected airborne drug traffickers
into Mexican air space. Such efforts should be given the highest
priority in our bilateral relations with Mexico, including the
Western Hemisphere discussions agreed upon between the Presidents
of the United States and Mexico on January 3, 1986. </p>

<p>7. The Policy Board should thoroughly evaluate expanded use of
Coast Guard aviation capabilities in drug interdiction. </p>

<p>8. Congress should give careful consideration to user fees as
a means of supplementing the Coast Guard's budget. Fees should go
directly to the Coast Guard's budget rather than the general
Treasury. </p>

<p>9. Both the Policy Board and the Department of Defense should
continue to examine Navy assistance to Coast Guard interdiction
operations, with a view to expanding such assistance whenever and
wherever possible. Such expansion should be facilitated by
adoption of the broader military view of national security
advocated in this report. </p>

<p>10. Monies from the proposed permanent asset forfeiture fund
should be made available to the Customs Service for the
acquisition of necessary equipment, including but not limited to
the type of fast patrol boats recently deployed in Operation Blue
Lightning. </p>

<p>11. Joint Federal-State-local interdiction operations, such as
Operation Blue Lightning, should be refined and used wherever
feasible and desirable. </p>

<p>Intelligence </p>

<p>1. The Policy Board should take all necessary steps to ensure
that data concerning all aspects of both drug supply and demand
are adequately collected, analyzed, correlated and disseminated. </p>

<p>2. The Federal electronic surveillance statute should be
examined and amended to reflect existing technology. Existing
State laws should be similarly studied and changed where
necessary. Those States still without a statute permitting
court-ordered electronic surveillance should immediately enact
one, consistent with current technology. </p>

<p>3. The &quot;Mansfield Amendment&quot; to the Foreign
Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2291 (c)(l)) should be repealed
in its entirety. The concerns addressed by that legislation
should be incorporated in agency guidelines which provide
necessary flexibility while embodying the limits of permissible
U.S. agency conduct. </p>

<p>4. Data relating to assets forfeited to Federal, State and
local jurisdictions should be collected, analyzed, and
disseminated by the all source intelligence center discussed
elsewhere in this report. </p>

<p>5. Because of the importance of information about individuals
in drug treatment programs, the Federal government should again
require the States to participate in the Client Oriented Data
Acquisition Process. </p>

<p>6. Both the Household Survey on Drug Abuse and the High School
Senior Survey should over sample populations thought to be heavy
drug users. In addition, because questions about the nature of
drug transactions, e.g., the price paid and purity and quantity
of the drug purchased, could provide important information for
policy makers and enforcement officials, such questions should be
added to the Household and High School Senior Surveys. </p>

<p>Combined Intelligence and Interdiction </p>

<p>1. The Policy Board should take immediate steps to ensure that
the law enforcement and intelligence communities are thoroughly
familiar with each other's needs and capabilities. </p>

<p>2. Every agency involved in the interdict ion of drug
shipments or the apprehension of drug traffickers should have
ready access to all necessary intelligence gathered in source and
transshipment countries. To the extent that this requires
expansion or modification of existing practices, the Policy Board
should ensure that such change is pursued immediately. In
particular, the critical nature of real-time intelligence to
effective Customs operations at the border must be recognized,
and the Policy Board should take all necessary steps to ensure
that, under current Federal organization, such information from
all sources is being provided. </p>

<p>3. To the extent that the intelligence community under the
current Federal structure needs direction from the highest levels
of government concerning aggressive anti-drug actions, including
operations against the infrastructure of foreign drug-trafficking
organizations, such direction should be provided immediately. </p>

<p>4. The &quot;all-source intelligence and operations
center,&quot; now being considered by the National Drug
Enforcement Policy Board, should be pursued aggressively and
expeditiously. It should combine in a physically secure facility
the functions now being performed by EPIC and NNBIS, retaining
the current Vice Presidential direction and regional structure of
the latter for interdiction functions. Ft. Bliss, Texas, and
similar locations should be considered as possible sites for the
center. Its design, giving due consideration to the protection of
civil liberties, should provide specific roles for all pertinent
Department of Defense components and for all members of the
intelligence community, to the fullest extent Permitted by
Executive Order 12333, The design should also incorporate
specific foreign intelligence-gathering functions for other U.S.
Agencies, in order to maximize the acquisition of both strategic
and tactical data. Each Participating agency should be required
to present to the Policy Board its specific operational
guidelines for providing time-sensitive data to the center. The
center should also Include a uniform national system for
gathering and analyzing drug related data on various categories
of information, including arrests, seizures, convictions,
sentences, forfeitures, emergency room admissions, and deaths. A
similar system of compiling and analyzing financial data gathered
by all members of the intelligence community, as well as that
contained in all financial records now required by law to be kept
by any Federal agency, should also be included as an Integral
component of the center. Both data bases should be compiled and
maintained in a fashion that provides reliable, constant, and
uniform tracking, retrieval, and compilation for the purpose of
charting trends and profiles, as well as support for specific
operations whenever Possible. Access to all data compiled should
be available to appropriate State and local agencies, in addition
to Federal components, subject to Procedures necessary to ensure
the integrity of the information-sharing process. </p>

<p>5. Joint enforcement and intelligence operations by source and
transshipment countries should be encouraged, and careful,
resourceful analysis should be given to identify means of U.S.
funding of such operations. Consistent with other recommendations
in this report, participation in such operations by American
components should be promoted. </p>

<p>6. The Department of State should stress to Chiefs of Mission
at principal reporting posts and to all other cognizant
Departmental personnel the high priority attached to a
coordinated narcotics intelligence and interdiction strategy. </p>

<p>7. All necessary steps should be taken to ensure that Consular
officers can and do deny U.S. entry visas to individuals
suspected of drug trafficking. Subject to the informing agency's
safeguards of reliability, information provided by any agency of
the United States, without further corroboration, should be
sufficient to require such denial under the pertinent statute, 8
U.S.C. Section 1182 (a)(23). The Policy Board should promptly
establish guidelines for similar information-sharing on a
government-wide basis. </p>

<p>8. Both Congress and the Executive Branch should closely
examine the operations and cost effectiveness of drug-related
intelligence-gathering abroad. When and where justified by such
an examination, resources available for such operations should be
expanded. Particular attention should be paid to the critical
need for adequate foreign intelligence by the Customs Service in
performing its border interdiction function. </p>

<p>9. Coast Guard officers should be thoroughly integrated into
the Defense Attache system. </p>

<p>10. The definition of &quot;national security&quot; now
employed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff as their starting point in
mission determination is: </p>

<p>A collective term encompassing both national defense and
foreign relations of the United States. Specifically, the
condition provided by: </p>

<p>a. a military or defense advantage over any foreign national
or group of nations, or </p>

<p>b. a favorable foreign relations position, or </p>

<p>c. a defense posture capable of successfully resisting hostile
or destructive action from within or without, overt or covert. </p>

<p>The Joint Chiefs should be instructed by the highest levels of
government, through a National Security Decision Directive or by
other appropriate means, that &quot;hostile or destructive action
from within or without, overt or covert,&quot; as used in this
definition, shall include the airborne, amphibious, and overland
invasion of this country by drug smugglers. This policy is
already followed by the intelligence community, pursuant to
Executive Order 12333. All Department of Defense and component
operational decisions concerning interdiction of drug smugglers
should be made accordingly. </p>

<p>11. For the purposes of intelligence-gathering mission
planning, the Joint Chiefs of Staff should be given direction
from the highest levels of government that the Defense
Department's definition of &quot;foreign hostile action&quot; is
to be brought into accord with the view expressed in Executive
Order 12333, as described in the preceding recommendation. </p>

<p>12. Consistent with the foregoing definitions of
&quot;national security&quot; and &quot;foreign hostile
action,&quot; Department of Defense policies and practices, such
as existing interpretations of the Economy Act, 31 U.S.C. Section
1535, and exemptions to the Posse Comitatus Act, 10 U.S.C.
Section 371 et al., should be thoroughly re-examined. Unit
planning and deployment should be adjusted accordingly. </p>

<p>13. The Posse Comitatus Act, IS U.S.C. Section 1385, and its
1981 exemptions, now found at 10 U.S.C. Section 371 et seq,
should be consolidated in Title 18. The consolidated statute
should include a statement of purpose reflecting the view of
national security advocated here and promoting an accordingly
expansive interpretation of the statutory language, subject to
such limitations as are necessary to protect civil liberties. </p>

<p>14. The Policy Board, in accordance with Executive Orders
12333 and 12472, and with applicable National Security Decision
Directives, if any, should coordinate with appropriate agencies
and departments to ensure that a secure and interoperable,
interagency communications capability is available for
drug-related intelligence collection and dissemination in support
of interdiction and other anti-drug activities. The resources and
expertise of the National Security Agency should be fully
exploited to this end, and operational and communications
security should be given a high priority in the training and
operating procedures of all pertinent agencies. </p>

<p>Domestic Investigations and Prosecutions </p>

<p>1. Domestic drug law enforcement efforts directed at
high-level trafficking groups should be supplemented by and
integrated with enforcement efforts directed at lower-level
trafficking groups and street-level drug activity. Unless the
necessary supplementation and integration occur, the enforcement
effort at all levels will be undermined. </p>

<p>2. Although the enforcement efforts of Federal and State and
local law enforcement agencies cannot and should not be
completely independent, these agencies nevertheless have primary
areas of responsibility. The Federal law enforcement agencies
should concentrate their efforts on infiltrating and disrupting
high-level organized crime and other large trafficking
organizations. State and local law enforcement agencies on the
other hand should focus their resources on street-level drug
activity and on smaller and geographically-restricted trafficking
organizations. </p>

<p>3. Although Federal, State and local agencies have primary
areas of responsibility, the drug problem is a national one that
requires extensive and genuine coordination and cooperation among
all agencies. Those in charge of the agencies involved in
domestic drug law enforcement must constantly instill In their
agents the need for such coordination and cooperation, especially
with respect to the exchange of drug intelligence. Joint
operations, such as Operation Pressure Point, the New York Drug
Enforcement Task Force, and the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement
Task Force Program, have fostered this required spirit of
cooperation and coordination, and they should be undertaken
whenever appropriate, provided that they do not interfere with an
agency's primary mission. </p>

<p>4. The sophistication of high-level trafficking groups
requires an equivalent Federal response. Because of the variety
of investigative techniques used by participating Federal
agencies and their unique ability to exploit such tools as
electronic surveillance, the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations Act (RICO), the Continuing Criminal Enterprise
statutory provision (CCE), forfeiture, and currency transactions
reports, the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force (OCDETF)
Program is the Federal mechanism that is best equipped to respond
to and disrupt high-level organized crime trafficking groups. Its
operation should be supported strongly and its scope should be
expanded wherever feasible and desirable. </p>

<p>5. Because the OCDETF Program has been operational for more
than two years, the National Drug Enforcement Policy Board should
consider whether a lead Task Force agency should be designated.
As an alternative, the U.S. attorneys Involved should be given
greater policy authority with respect to the participating
agencies In order to improve still further the coordination that
has been achieved by the consensus-based decision-making
approach. If the latter approach is taken, the Board must take
steps to ensure uniform policies and priorities are recognized by
all United States Attorneys involved. </p>

<p>6. The heads of the agencies participating in the OCDETF
Program must continually and unambiguously reiterate their total
commitment to the success of the program. One simple way they can
do so is to ensure that their agents involved in the Program are
not affected adversely in any way with respect to career
advancement by their participation therein. </p>

<p>7. The components of Federal domestic law enforcement other
than the OCDE Task Forces should focus their resources on
organized crime trafficking groups that do not qualify for OCDETF
program treatment and on other large trafficking organizations,
which may or may not be multi-jurisdictional. </p>

<p>8. To eliminate jurisdictional disputes between the Federal
agencies involved in domestic law enforcement, to avoid
duplication of investigative efforts, and to increase the safety
of drug agents, the National Drug Enforcement Policy Board should
establish a system whereby agencies would be required to file
reports on whom they are investigating. If more than one agency
is investigating the same individual, the agencies involved would
be required to negotiate and to determine the best way for
proceeding with the investigation, subject to uniform Policy
Board guidelines. Such a reporting and control system should be
incorporated into the &quot;all source intelligence and
operations center&quot; recommended elsewhere in this report. </p>

<p>9. It is an appropriate time to consider whether the mission
of the Customs Service with respect to drug trafficking should be
expanded to include intelligence and law enforcement functions
beyond the borders and ports of entry within this country, where
appropriate, subject to the lead responsibility of the Drug
Enforcement Administration (DEA). </p>

<p>10. DEA should determine which chemicals currently used to
manufacture illicit drugs should be subject to reporting
requirements or placed in a Schedule established by the
Controlled Substances Act. This review should include a
consideration of which drugs are most abused, which have the most
serious consequences, which precursor chemicals are essential to
the production process, and which chemicals could feasibly be
regulated. In addition, DEA should identify the resources needed
for the computerization, analysis, and follow-up of reports
concerning chemicals selected for monitoring. </p>

<p>11. The research and development operations of Federal drug
law enforcement agencies should work closely with their field
agents to produce the equipment and tools necessary to defeat
traffickers. The expertise of the Central Intelligence and
National Security Agencies should be called upon to the fullest
extent possible and proper in this regard. </p>

<p>12. Although the drug problem is a national one, its immediate
effects are felt most at State and local levels. To respond
effectively to the drug problem, State and local jurisdictions
will have to increase expenditures for such critical resources as
prison facilities, increased manpower, and sophisticated
equipment. </p>

<p>13. States must provide their law enforcement agencies with
certain tools available to their Federal counterparts. Those
States, which do not already have such statutes, should consider
enacting legislation patterned after the following Federal
statutes: Bail Reform Act of 1984; the Racketeer Influenced and
Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act; statutory use and derivative
use immunity for witnesses; statutory criminal and civil
forfeiture provisions; the Continuing Criminal Enterprise (CCE)
statute; Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets
Act of 1968 (electronic surveillance); and the Currency and
Foreign Transactions Reporting Act. States should consider
adopting statewide grand juries in order to improve their
investigations of drug trafficking organizations, as well as
eliminating accomplice corroboration statutes or rules. </p>

<p>Foreign Assistance </p>

<p>1. Because drug trafficking and production are threats of such
magnitude to the stability of existing democracies, a primary
goal of the United States and its allies should be to enhance the
security of drug producing and transshipment regions. </p>

<p>2. As a part of its international responsibilities, the
National Drug Enforcement Policy Board should participate in the
President's annual decision whether to suspend aid to drug
producing or transshipment countries. The Board should examine
the drug control efforts made by each foreign nation and make a
suitable recommendation to the President for his ultimate
decision. </p>

<p>3. The willingness of a country to engage in and actively
implement drug-related extradition and mutual assistance treaties
should be a primary consideration in the ultimate U.S. policy
decision regarding foreign assistance to that country. </p>

<p>4. The Departments of State and Defense should continue their
programs of economic and security assistance with emphasis on
assisting those foreign governments making concerted efforts to
control their drug problems. </p>

<p>5. The United States should continue to help producer and
trafficking nations develop prevention and education programs
aimed at drug abuse within these countries. </p>

<p>Source Country Crop Control </p>

<p>1. In light of restrictions inherent in international crop
control efforts, the Board should initiate a thorough
cost/benefit analysis of the entire history of those efforts by
the United States. If justified by such an analysis, the
Department of State, through its Bureau of International
Narcotics Matters (BINM), should initiate or intensify crop
control and plant eradication programs selectively and
judiciously in those countries where the political and economic
climates make it probable that crop eradication programs will
succeed. </p>

<p>2. The Department of State should establish and present to the
Policy Board a specific formula for triggering the cut-off of
foreign aid provided for in the &quot;Diplomacy Against
Drugs&quot; amendment to the Foreign Assistance Act. </p>

<p>3. Narcotics Assistance Unit positions must be recognized by
the State Department as priority Foreign Service assignments. The
State Department should establish a select group of professional
Narcotics Officers to fill those positions, and should ensure
that those positions are fully integrated into the career
advancement structure within the Foreign Service. </p>

<p>4. BINM should expand the range of possibilities under
consideration as alternatives to illicit drug cultivation for
source country farmers and include such options as mining,
petroleum production, and light industry, where feasible. </p>

<p>Reducing Demand for Drugs </p>

<p>1. A thorough review of the current budgetary allotments for
anti-drug efforts, now contemplated by the National Drug
Enforcement Policy Board, should be placed at the top of the
agenda of the Board immediately. If that review indicates that
greater Federal resources should be devoted to programs to reduce
demand, the Board should pursue appropriate action without
hesitation. </p>

<p>2. A portion of the Federal government's asset forfeiture
fund, derived from drug cases, should be devoted to programs to
reduce demand in whatever proportion is indicated by the review
recommended above. Funding to reduce demand should include a
responsible contribution to the States for their own programs in
this area. However, any funding directed to the States should be
made contingent upon their vigorous pursuit of such programs, and
after a reasonable grace period, as determined by the Board or by
Congress, funding should be denied to any State failing this
requirement. Failure to enact State electronic surveillance
measures and asset forfeiture provisions, with the proceeds
thereof directed to anti-drug programs, should constitute per se
failure. </p>

<p>3. The President should direct the heads of all Federal
agencies to formulate immediately clear policy statements, with
implementing guidelines, including suitable drug testing
programs, expressing the utter unacceptability of drug abuse by
Federal employees. State and local governments and leaders in the
private sector should support unequivocally a similar policy that
any and all use of drugs is unacceptable. Government contracts
should not be awarded to companies that fail to implement drug
programs, Including suitable drug testing. No Federal, State, or
local government funds should go directly or indirectly to
programs that counsel &quot;responsible&quot; drug use or condone
illicit drug use in any way. Laws in certain States which
&quot;decriminalized&quot; the possession of marijuana constitute
a form of such condonation, and should be reconsidered. </p>

<p>4. States that have not already done so should enact and
enforce laws prohibiting the sale of drug paraphernalia. </p>

<p>5. The States should be required to report information about
their prevention and treatment programs to the National Institute
on Drug Abuse. With this information, and reports obtained from
private programs, NIDA will be better able to identify the best
prevention and treatment programs and to develop and disseminate
standards and guidelines for such programs to the States. The
States should, in turn, provide this information to all groups
engaged in prevention, treatment, and related research. </p>

<p>6. Consistent with identified measures of success, State
governments should establish credentialing standards for
prevention and treatment programs. They should further require
that all elementary, junior high, and high schools within the
State Include drug abuse prevention programs in their curricula,
designed in a manner consistent with such credentialing
standards. State funding should be made available to assure the
proper training of educators assigned to such programs. </p>

<p>7. Every employer, public and private, and public education
institutions at all levels should have clearly-stated policies
prohibiting drug use, possession of drugs, or being under the
influence of drugs on their premises. The consequences of
violating these prohibitions should be clearly explained. </p>

<p>8. Government and private sector employers who do not already
require drug testing of job applicants and current employees
should consider the appropriateness of such a testing program. </p>

<p>9. State and local law enforcement authorities should enforce
more vigorously the laws prohibiting possession of drugs, and
State legislatures should ensure that enforcement agencies have
the necessary resources to do so. Such resources can be funded in
large part, if not entirely, through effective asset forfeiture
programs. </p>

<p>10. Uniform and rational sentencing for drug offenses is
essential. Such a system should provide a sentence of probation
and a fine for a first offense involving mere possession of
drugs. The terms of probation should include a requirement to
remain drug-free to be verified, if necessary, through periodic
drug testing. A second offense for possession of drugs should
result in a jail sentence or mandatory treatment or fines or all
three. </p>

<p>11. The media and entertainment industries should carefully
review their portrayals of drug use and its consequences and
ensure their accuracy. </p>

<p>12. Health professionals should be thoroughly trained to
identify and counsel drug abusers. </p>

<p>13. Relying on the task force approach which law enforcement
officials have used successfully, parents, churches, schools,
civic organizations and business associations should form
community task forces to provide a unified front against drugs. </p>

<p>Conclusion </p>

<p>The recommendations made here have not been reached
carelessly. They are the result of months of concerted research
and analysis, documented in the body of the report. Although some
recommendations reach to the most fundamental levels of
government agency operation and community life, they have been
presented only after consideration of every identifiable option. </p>

<p>The depth of concern expressed in this report is not the
result of any preordained strategy. Rather, it reflects this
Commission's recognition, based on objective evidence, that we
are confronted with a national crisis. Every course of action,
including a failure to act at all, has a natural consequence. The
recommendations made here are those actions deemed most effective
in promoting a national campaign against drugs at all levels of
society.<br>

<h2>Drug Abuse, Drug Trafficking, &amp; Organized Crime </h2>

<p><b>President's Commission on Organized Crime, 1986 </b></p>

<hr>

<h2>Consultant Paper: Data and Analysis Requirements for Policy
Toward Drug Enforcement and Organized Crime </h2>

<p>By Mark Kleiman. Submitted: November 1985. Mark Kleiman is a
Research Fellow in the Program in Criminal Justice Policy and
Management at the John F. Kennedy School of Government of Harvard
University, Senior Lecturer in Political Science at the
University of Rochester, and President of BOTEC Analysis
Corporation. </p>

<p>Executive Summary </p>

<p>Organized crime control and drug enforcement need to be
considered together insofar as drug trafficking contributes to
the organized crime problem or organized crime contributes to the
drug problem. In making policy it would be useful to know about
(1) the role of drug trafficking in supporting organized crime
groups; (2) the role of organized crime groups in supplying
drugs; and (3) the effects on each problem of changing
enforcement practices in the other. </p>

<p>Drug trafficking is almost certainly the largest source of
illegally-earned income in the United States. </p>

<p>Both &quot;traditionally&quot; organized crime groups (Mafia
families) and &quot;emerging&quot; organized crime groups
participate in some aspects of the illicit drug trafficking
industry. In addition, some drug trafficking organizations have
some of the characteristics of organized crime groups, such as
the capacity and reputation for the use of violence and
corruption to frustrate enforcement. </p>

<p>Organized crime can participate in drug markets either
&quot;productively,&quot; using its lawbreaking skills to
contribute to the supply of illicit drugs, or
&quot;parasitically,&quot; using violence and the threat of
violence to extort drug merchants or organize cartels. Only the
productive activity of organized crime contributes to the drug
supply problem, which is the main target of drug enforcement.
Parasitic organized crime activity, in illicit markets as in
legitimate markets, tends to raise prices and reduce consumption.
</p>

<p>Controlling organized crime and controlling drug abuse (and
drug-abuse-related crime) are two distinct objectives. Some
agencies of government - the Drug Enforcement Administration
(DEA) and the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), for
example - have primary responsibility for drug abuse control.
Others, like the Organized Crime Strike Forces, are concerned
primarily with organized crime control. The two sets of agencies
may or may not promote each other's objectives. </p>

<p>Drug enforcement actions may affect the drug markets in
several ways. They may: (1) help or hurt the efforts of organized
crime to participate in and profit from drug dealing; (2)
encourage or retard the development of organized-crime-like
characteristics among drug trafficking groups; and (3) lead to
more or fewer convictions of organized criminals. Unless it is
deliberately focused on organized crime groups, high-level drug
enforcement may tend to foster organized crime by keeping prices
high and driving out less well-organized competitors. </p>

<p>Organized crime enforcement actions may make the task of drug
enforcement harder or easier, depending on whether the roles of
those groups in the drug markets are primarily parasitic or
primarily productive. Aside from heroin importation into New
York, traditional organized crime is largely a parasite on the
drug markets; thus, as long as the organized crime effort
concentrates on the Mafia, it has little to contribute to drug
supply reduction. </p>

<p>Data about drug trafficking and drug enforcement, and about
the relationships between the drug trade and organized crime, can
serve three purposes: describing the current dimensions of the
problem, reasoning about how changes in enforcement activity
might make matters better or worse, and measuring the actual
effects of such changes after they are made. </p>

<p>From the perspective of organized crime policy, essential
facts about the drug markets are prices and quantities, and, most
important, the relationship between changes in retail price and
changes in the quantity purchased: the price-elasticity of
demand. Driving up the price of an inelastically-demanded drug
will increase the total revenues of traffickers of that drug, and
thus tend to promote organized crime. </p>

<p>Data about the drug markets and drug enforcement come from
three sources: (1) survey research; (2) observations of the
consequences of drug abuse (deaths, injuries, and demand for
treatment); and (3) enforcement statistics and reports. </p>

<p>Current large survey efforts, among households and high-school
seniors, do not gather much price and quantity data. We need a
separate national survey with a sample designed to overrepresent
heavy drug-users, that ask very detailed questions about price,
quantity, and conditions of drug purchase. In addition, local and
regional surveys should be conducted to evaluate the effect of
enforcement initiatives on market conditions and drug
consumption. </p>

<p>Two techniques not now in use - &quot;panel&quot; surveys of
drug users and surveys of convicted dealers - should be
undertaken, if the difficult operational and ethical issues can
be resolved. </p>

<p>Neither abuse-consequence data now gathered (medical examiner
and emergency-room reports through the Drug Abuse Warning Network
(DAWN), drug abuse treatment data through the remnants of the
Client-Oriented Data Acquisition Process (CODAP), opinions of
treatment professionals through the Community Epidemiology Work
Group (CEWG)) nor alternative ways of reaching the same facts are
very useful in making organized crime/drug enforcement policy
choices. These programs serve other purposes and should not be
disturbed, except for adding bioassay capability to some DAWN
sites. Pilot programs to test jail admittees for heroin use are
worth pursuing. </p>

<p>More could be done with enforcement agency data, which could
tell us about the enforcement effort itself (agency activities,
targets, measured results) and on its effects (prices at
different levels of the drug trade). The new management of the
Drug Enforcement Administration has put less effort into
estimating prices and quantities in the drug markets. That change
should be reversed, and DEA should again publish price-chain
estimates. </p>

<p>Enforcement agencies can also make and analyze retail-level
drug purchases, unrelated to specific cases, to measure the state
of the drug markets. Such &quot;monitor&quot; programs should be
increased in frequency, systematized, and applied to marijuana
and cocaine as well as heroin. </p>

<p>Recent revisions in the methods used by the National Narcotics
Intelligence Consumers Committee (NNICC) in preparing the annual
Narcotics Intelligence Estimate (NIE) appear to have somewhat
reduced that document's inconsistencies with observable fact.
However, the NNICC still seems to practice analysis by
negotiation rather than basing its estimates on evidence. The NIE
would be more useful if its assumptions, data, and computations
were explicit. There might be value in allowing a group of
experts outside the government access to NNICC documents and
sources, from which they could develop an independent set of
estimates. </p>

<p>Questions to be Answered: </p>

<p>Drug trafficking and organized crime are linked problems.
Policy making and evaluation for each is complicated by the
presence of the other. My objective is to outline a set of data
collection and analysis activities that would answer questions
under four headings: </p>

<p>1. What effects do organized crime have on drug trafficking
and enforcement? </p>

<p>2. What effects do drug trafficking and enforcement have on
organized crime? </p>

<p>3. How should federal agencies engaged in organized crime
enforcement adjust their policies to contribute to the objectives
of drug policy? </p>

<p>4. How should federal agencies engaged in drug enforcement
adjust their policies to contribute to the objective of organized
crime control? </p>

<p>Data collection and analysis are never free; in the drug area,
they are likely to be quite expensive. It is therefore important
to identify in advance what is relatively certain on the basis of
information and analysis now in hand; it doesn't take a
spectroscopic analysis to discover that the sky is blue. The
following section will therefore attempt to describe what we now
know and to identify the key analytic points. </p>

<p>Introduction: Drug Enforcement and Organized Crime Control </p>

<p>How Two Objectives and Two Sets of Institutions Intersect </p>

<p>The objective of drug enforcement is to keep drugs away from
consumers. The objective of organized crime enforcement is to
control the wealth and power of major criminal organizations and
to frustrate their goal of being able to defy the law. </p>

<p>These objectives interact where the illicit drug business is a
major source of power or revenue to organized crime groups (or a
major source of their vulnerability to enforcement), and where
the capabilities of organized crime groups make drugs more
available than they would otherwise be: in other words, where the
drug trade contributes to the organized crime problem or where
organized crime contributes to the drug problem. </p>

<p>Defining Organized Crime </p>

<p>The term organized crime can be used in one of two ways. It
may be merely an ethnically neutral euphemism for &quot;the
Mafia&quot; or &quot;La Cosa Nostra&quot; (LCN); or it may
describe a class of criminal organizations whose characteristics
make them particularly worthy of law enforcement attention. Size,
wealth, political power, participation in a variety of criminal
activities, and continuity over time have all been suggested as
such characteristics. </p>

<p>One way to bridge the gap between the two definitional
approaches is to refer to the Mafia as &quot;traditional&quot;
organized crime, while acknowledging the existence of other,
&quot;emerging,&quot; organized crime groups. </p>

<p>Defining organized crime in terms of its characteristics,
rather than ostensibly, complicates the analysis. Not only does
this approach treat the set of &quot;organized crime&quot; groups
as variable rather than fixed; it also implies a many-valued
rather than two-valued classification. Criminal groups, rather
than simply being organized crime or non-organized crime (i.e.,
Mafia families or other), will fall along a spectrum of being
more or less &quot;organized-crime-like.&quot; This suggests the
possibility that drug enforcement activity can increase or
decrease the number of drug-dealing organizations with many
organized crime characteristics. It also suggests that it can
make existing organized-crime-like drug dealers more or less
organized-crime-like and give such groups a greater or lesser
share of the drug market. </p>

<p>This paper will attempt to distinguish between traditional and
emerging organized crime groups, but will think of organized
crime as primarily a set of organizational characteristics rather
than a predefined set of organizations. The relevant
characteristics are organizational continuity and organizational
investment in the capability and reputation for violent or
corrupt interference with law enforcement activity. </p>

<p>Organized Crime as a Drug Supply Problem </p>

<p>&quot;Traditional&quot; organized crime - La Cosa Nostra -
does not now contribute substantially to the drug problem, with
the exception of the major roles of two of the five New York LCN
&quot;families&quot; in heroin importation. This is not to say
that LCN members and associates do not participate in drug
dealing on many levels, but only that they make no distinctive
contribution to the supply of illicit drugs. Indeed, as Thomas
Schelling has pointed out, the activity of organized crime in
cartel formation and extortion from illicit entrepreneurs may on
balance reduce the supply and increase the price of illicit
goods, as is true in licit markets. </p>

<p>As a consequence, organized crime enforcement institutions -
the Strike Forces and the investigators who work with them - have
relatively little to contribute to solving the problem of illicit
drug supply, as long as they continue their concentration on
&quot;traditional&quot; organized crime groups. This
concentration has been so successful, both in terms of successful
cases and in terms of creating and maintaining productive,
high-morale enforcement and prosecution institutions, that it
seems both unlikely (as a matter of prediction) to be changed and
unwise (as a matter of policy analysis) to consider changing. </p>

<p>It may be the case that some &quot;emerging&quot; organized
crime groups make distinctive contributions to various parts of
drug supply, so that their disruption would contribute to drug
supply control (over and above the general effect of enforcement
in raising prices by raising the costs and risks of drug
trafficking). Outlaw motorcycle gangs - the Hell's Angels in the
West, the Outlaws in the Mid-Atlantic region - may be
&quot;least-cost suppliers&quot; in the distribution of cocaine,
amphetamines, and phencyclidine (PCP). Similarly, some
ethnic-based organizations among Asian-Americans may be
significant contributors to the heroin supply, as the Herrera
organization certainly was at least until the recent arrests. By
contrast, neither the importation nor the distribution of
marijuana appears to offer the economies of organization that
would make breaking up particular trafficking groups a major
marijuana enforcement objective. The marijuana trade may be at
its most efficient as a decentralized set of independent buyers
and sellers. </p>

<p>To develop a set of institutions to appropriately address the
role of emerging organized crime groups in the drug markets will
require devising organizational incentives and career patterns
that support extremely long-term investigations and investments
in intelligence (broadly defined), while maintaining a
supply-control orientation among agents and prosecutors. This
will not be an easy task. There may be lessons to be learned from
the Federal Bureau of Narcotics in its approach to LCN heroin
dealing. </p>

<p>The Drug Markets as an Organized Crime Problem </p>

<p>The illicit drug traffic contributes to the organized crime
problem because of the enormous amounts of money at stake. These
potential revenues will both attract (and help to sustain)
existing organized crime groups and call into existence new
groups with organized crime characteristics. </p>

<p>LCN families, other ethnically-based organizations long in
existence, and outlaw motorcycle gangs may engage in drug dealing
as a way to support themselves financially and to take advantage
of their organizational abilities in illicit transactions. The
opportunities in the drug trade may also allow the development of
organizations whose origin is in drug dealing, and which may
remain specialized in drug dealing, while taking on organized
crime characteristics, in particular, organizational continuity
and organizational investments in the abilities to use violence
and corruption to resist enforcement efforts while remaining
prominent in illicit markets. </p>

<p>Drug trafficking is almost certainly the largest source of
illegally-earned income in the United States, far outstripping
the market for illegal gambling or prostitution. Estimates of
total revenues from drug sales vary widely and are highly
unreliable. It seems unlikely that total annual revenues are much
less than $25-30 billion. </p>

<p>Virtually all of this represents rewards for lawbreaking; the
payments forlicit goods and services (rental or purchase of
vehicles and buildings; lawyers' fees) are negligible. On the
other hand, relatively little represents revenue to large
criminal organizations, because so much of the final retail price
of illegal drugs consists of the markups of retail dealers and
low-level wholesalers. For heroin and cocaine less than one-tenth
of the final retail price is collected by the dealer who sells
kilogram units. Marijuana, by contrast, with much less vigorous
enforcement at lower levels, undergoes only about a four-to-one
price markup between first domestic distribution and final retail
sale. </p>

<p>Therefore, while all three markets have total values on the
order of $10 billion per year, more than $2 billion of the
marijuana market represents the revenues of high-level
organizations, while the heroin and cocaine markets at that level
represent about $1 billion each. On the other hand, the tighter
distribution channels for heroin and cocaine make it possible for
large and highly disciplined organizations to exist at the
wholesale-retail level, so that organizations with many of the
characteristics of organized crime may exist at lower levels of
those trades (e.g., the Barnes organization in the Harlem heroin
market). </p>

<p>Making Strategy </p>

<p>Drug enforcement actions change the drug markets in ways that
may: (1) help or hurt the efforts of existing organized crime
enterprises, whether traditional or emerging, to participate in
and profit from them; (2) encourage or retard the development of
organized crime characteristics in existing or new enterprises
within the drug markets; (3) be more or less helpful in securing
convictions against members of already-identified organized crime
groups and the identification of new groups meeting those
criteria. </p>

<p>The more effectively drug enforcement is directed toward
organized crime control, the less hospitable organized crime
groups will find the drug markets. On the other hand, an increase
in the overall level of drug enforcement not aimed specifically
at organized crime groups may tend to frustrate organized crime
control by helping existing organized crime groups profit from
the drug trade and by encouraging existing drug enterprises to
take on more organized crime characteristics. </p>

<p>The ability of organized crime groups to profit from the drug
trade - and the tendency of the drug trade to spawn new organized
crime groups - depends both on the amount of money to be made in
that trade and on whether the environment rewards or punishes
tight control and a reputation for violence. Under some
conditions, tightened enforcement can both boost the total money
available to be made and confer competitive advantage on more
violent groups at the expense of less violent ones. </p>

<p>Tighter enforcement can increase the money to be made in any
black market, if it succeeds in raising the price of the
commodity involved and if consumption decreases less, in
percentage terms, than prices rise. (A 50 percent price increase
that causes only a 20 percent decrease in volume will create a
new market with total revenues 1.5 x 0.8 = 1.2 times as large as
the revenues in the old market, and thus increase the money to be
made by 0.2 or 20 percent.) Thus the sensitivity of consumer
demand to retail price - what economists call the
price-elasticity of demand - becomes an essential number to know.
</p>

<p>If the price-elasticity of demand is (in absolute value)
greater than one - if a given percentage increase in price will
cause a larger percentage decrease in volume - then price
increases will decrease total revenues. (Such goods are said to
be &quot;relatively elastically demanded.&quot;) On the other
hand, if the price-elasticity of demand is (in absolute value)
less than one - if a given percentage change in price will cause
a smaller percentage change in volume, as in the example above -
then price increases will increase total revenues. (Such goods
are said to be &quot;relatively inelastically demanded.&quot;) </p>

<p>In markets where demand is relatively elastic - where
consumers will respond to price increases by cutting back
consumption sharply - increased enforcement will reduce the money
at stake and thus tend to make the markets less lucrative for
organized crime. Where demand is inelastic, increasing
enforcement will increase the money at stake and thus make the
markets more able to support organized crime. Much of the
empirical work recommended below centers on measuring the
price-elasticity of demand for various drugs. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, it appears that the demand for marijuana and
cocaine is relatively inelastic. (The argument with respect to
marijuana is on much firmer ground than the argument with respect
to cocaine.) In any case, tightened general drug enforcement - as
opposed to drug enforcement targeted at organized crime - will
tend to give organized crime groups and organized crime-like
groups relative competitive advantage, because their capacity for
violence and corruption helps protect then against ordinary
enforcement actions. This is the central tension in organized
crime/drug enforcement policy: good drug enforcement may be bad
organized crime control. </p>

<p>Observations to be Made </p>

<p>The observations to be made fall into three broad classes:
retail purchasing and consumption, lower-level dealing, and
enforcement activity. (Of course, observations on high-level
dealing are also of great importance, but they are almost
impossible to distinguish from enforcement intelligence. Data
collection here means talking to agents, enforcement-agency
analysts, and prosecutors, and the information to be collected is
rarely in quantitative form.) </p>

<p>Three Objectives of Data Collection and Analysis </p>

<p>Data collection and analysis about drug markets can serve
three distinct functions: </p>

<p>- Descriptive: measuring the current dimensions of the problem
and identifying trends. Sample questions: How much cocaine was
sold to end users last year? What prices do they pay? How were
those revenues distributed among individuals and groups in the
illicit cocaine industry? What were the relationships between
identified organized crime groups and cocaine trafficking? How
have the volumes and prices in the cocaine market changed over
time? What organized crime groups are active in the cocaine
market? What role does it play in their other activities? What
roles do they play - productive or parasitic - in the market? </p>

<p>- Theoretical: generating and testing hypotheses about
relationships among variables, and in particular about the likely
effects of changes in enforcement. Sample questions: Are there
&quot;barriers to entry&quot; at some levels of the cocaine trade
that allow traffickers to collect &quot;pure&quot; profits
(&quot;economic rents&quot;)? How would the average size and
longevity of cocaine-trafficking organizations change if
enforcement were substantially tightened? </p>

<p>- Evaluative: measuring the actual effects of enforcement
initiatives. Sample question: How did the South Florida Task
Force change prices and volumes in the cocaine market? </p>

<p>Three Sources of Data </p>

<p>Illicit activities are by their nature hard to observe and
measure, because participants attempt to conceal them from
authorities. Excise tax data, which provide the most convenient
measures of alcohol and tobacco consumption, are unavailable for
illicit drug markets. The same is true of the reports routinely
prepared by licit enterprises reports to state and federal tax
collectors, to trade associations and government statistical
collectors, to trade associations and government statistical
agencies, and to stockholders - from which estimates of licit
markets are derived. </p>

<p>The remaining potential sources of information about illicit
drug markets are: </p>

<p>(1) Surveys of drug users and potential drug users; </p>

<p>(2) Observations of the consequences of drug - abuse health
effects, intoxicated behavior, and demand for treatment - and the
opinions of professionals who deal with those consequences; and </p>

<p>(3) Enforcement data and the opinions of agents and
prosecutors. </p>

<p>Note that while surveys and observations of consequences tell
us almost exclusively about the behavior of drug consumers and
drug dealers, enforcement data and the opinions of enforcement
professionals can also tell us about the other half of the
equation: the governmental response. </p>

<p>Several current programs now attempt to tap these three
sources of information. None is without major flaws from the
perspective of organized crime policy. A major problem common to
many is that they are more concerned with numbers of users and
frequency of use consumed than with quantities consumed and flows
of revenues. </p>

<p>Survey Research </p>

<p>Survey research is potentially the most powerful tool
available for studying the markets for illicit drugs. Unlike data
from enforcement activity or abuse consequences, survey research
can attempt to measure prices and quantities directly rather than
through complicated chains of inference. Performing surveys about
consumption activities - market research supports a rather
prosperous industry, including both for-profit enterprises and
prestigious universities and nonprofit research centers. These
institutions have developed a repertoire of established
techniques. The fact that consumer-goods firms continue to use it
heavily testifies to the ability of market research to measure
and predict consumer behavior. </p>

<p>The National Institute on Drug Abuse funds two series of
survey research projects on illicit drug consumption. The Social
Research Group of George Washington University does a survey
every two years of more than 5,000 persons 12 years or older
living in households [Miller et al. 1983]. This series is
referred to among students of drug abuse as &quot;the household
survey.&quot; </p>

<p>Every year, the Institute of Social Research of the University
of Michigan questions about 17,000 seniors in high school. The
Michigan reports are referred to as &quot;the high-school senior
survey.&quot; These two surveys are believed to cost NIDA
something less than one-half a million dollars for each two-year
cycle. </p>

<p>The concept of survey research is simple. Draw a sample so
designed that every member of the population under study has an
equal probability of being chosen. (This is what statisticians
mean by the term &quot;random sample.&quot; A variant on simple
randomization is to divide the population under study into
subgroups, called &quot;strata,&quot; and to draw the sample so
that each stratum is represented in proportion to its
representation in the population, and each member of a given
stratum has the same chance of being drawn as any other member.
This procedure, called &quot;stratified random sampling,&quot; is
the most commonly used.) Having drawn the sample, ask questions
and record the answers. Then use the percentage answers from the
sample as estimates of the behavior of the population from which
the sample was drawn: that is, make population projections based
on sample results. </p>

<p>Surveys can be inaccurate for three reasons: random error,
sample bias, and response bias. </p>

<p>Random error (or &quot;sampling error&quot;) occurs because
the law of averages only works on average. If 30 percent of the
population uses Crest Toothpaste, then in a sample of 100 persons
drawn at random about 30 will say they use Crest. But the
operative word is &quot;about:&quot; one time it will be 28,
another 33. The larger the sample, the smaller the random
sampling error, in accord with well-known statistical formulas.
This does not depend on the size of the population to be
measured: a sample of 1,000 is subject to the same sampling error
in estimating a population of 100,000 as in estimating a
population of 10 million. The rule of thumb is that the sampling
error is inversely proportional to the square root of the sample
size: a sample four times as big gives estimates one half as
uncertain. For many purposes - predicting the outcome of a
Presidential election, for example - a sample size of a few
hundred is ample. </p>

<p>The smaller the percentage of a population that has some
trait, the larger the sample needed to measure that trait
accurately, because a sampling error of 2 percent looms larger if
the underlying figure is 5 percent than if it is 50 percent.
Thus, attempts to measure rare phenomena - heroin use, for
example - take bigger samples than attempts to measure common
phenomena such as alcohol use. The other factor that drives up
needed sample sizes is the desire to study how subgroups of a
population differ. In a study of the effect of income on cocaine
use, the relevant sample size is the number of respondents within
each income class. To study whether recent increases in marijuana
enforcement by the Boston DEA office succeeded in reducing
marijuana consumption, one would need a sample including at least
a few hundred marijuana consumers from New England, and a similar
sample from another area to serve as a control. </p>

<p>Other than the expensive expedient of using very large sample
sizes - such as the 50,000 households interviewed each month by
the Bureau of Labor Statistics - the only way to reduce
sampling-error problems in estimating rare traits is to deviate
from stratified random sampling. Areas under special study or
subpopulations among which the trait in question is less rare can
be deliberately overrepresented. For example, if cocaine use is
concentrated among upper-income urban males in the 20-45 age
bracket, a study of cocaine use might deliberately seek out a
sample including more such people; this is called oversampling.
The results of a survey using oversampling need to be adjusted to
project them back on the population. Those adjustments introduce
great complexity into the statistical analysis of survey data.
Subtle errors can easily creep in. In consequence, survey
researchers try to avoid using oversamples. </p>

<p>Random error, just because it is random, does not tend to bias
results. The luck of the draw produces overestimates and
underestimates impartially. It does, however, introduce
uncertainty. This is more of a problem when trying to measure
trends (where small changes from one survey to the next matter
greatly) than in measuring absolute levels. By contrast, both
sample bias and response bias can create systematic divergences
between survey results and actual phenomena. </p>

<p>Sample bias comes from a failure to draw a representative
sample. If the sampling technique makes persons with a given
trait under study more or less likely than average to be
selected, the sample results will consistently overestimate or
underestimate the trait in question. For example, the household
survey omits persons with no fixed address and those living in
dormitories, barracks, and prisons. If very heavy drug users are
more likely than the general population to be drifting, away at
school, in the service, or in prison, then the household survey
will underestimate the number of very heavy drug users.
Similarly, the high-school senior survey may underrepresent drug
abuse among persons in that age range for two reasons. By
choosing to study high-school seniors, it omits dropouts, who may
be more likely than average to be heavy drug users. In addition,
the actual sampling technique may tend to underrepresent frequent
absentees, and frequent absenteeism seems to be associated with
heavy drug use. </p>

<p>If the only statistics of interest are population proportions
(e.g., the proportion of the voters who think the President is
doing a good job), sample bias is a controllable problem. When
frequency or quantity is at issue (e.g., how frequently the
average high-school senior smokes marijuana, how much cocaine was
consumed last year, the total amount paid for heroin) sample bias
can be a major worry. A small proportion of any population can
easily account for a very large fraction of any activity, from
baseball games attended to books purchased. In the case of
alcohol, for example, 5 percent of the population accounts for 50
percent of the consumption. By one estimate, 10 percent of the
marijuana-using population smokes two-thirds of the marijuana.
Cocaine consumption may be even more skewed, with the additional
problem that the total number of cocaine users is itself much
smaller than the totals for marijuana and alcohol; two-thirds or
more of the cocaine consumption may be accounted for by one-half
a million users. </p>

<p>Sampling procedures to guard against underrepresenting such
very small populations are hard to devise, particularly when the
behavior under study tends to make them furtive or to reduce
their participation in various normal activities. Oversampling
can help; so can what are called &quot;snowball&quot; techniques,
where respondents who fit some profile are asked for the names of
other respondents. The illicit nature of drug abuse can make
&quot;snowball&quot; sampling very difficult, however. </p>

<p>Response bias comes from the systematic failure of respondents
to answer accurately. Any survey will gather some inaccurate
responses, due to misunderstanding the questions, lapses of
memory, or deliberate deception by respondents resulting from
fear of breach of confidentiality, embarrassment, or a simple
desire to tell the interviewer what the respondent thinks he or
she wants to be told. As long as those errors cancel out, they
pose no problem. The problem comes if the inaccuracies are tilted
to one side or the other. A survey that asks questions about
activities that are both illegal and socially disapproved runs a
greater-than-normal risk of encountering response bias. </p>

<p>A clue to how serious response bias can be, even with legal
behavior, comes from surveys where people are asked how much
alcohol they drink. Only two-thirds of the alcohol on which
excise tax is paid (which may be an undercount of alcohol sold if
distillers cheat the Treasury) is accounted for by survey
responses; the survey data thus underestimate consumption by at
least 50 percent. It has been suggested that psychological
&quot;denial&quot; by a small population of extremely heavy
drinkers may account for most of the difference. Here again, as
with sample bias, problems with a very small portion of the
sample can cause the results to be seriously wrong. On the other
hand, a compilation of studies in which survey responses to
questions about illegal drug use were compared with urine-test
results showed no tendency to underreport. </p>

<p>A special kind of response-bias problem comes when survey data
are used to estimate trends. If the level or social disapproval
as perceived by recipients changes, then response bias may change
too. For example, increasingly negative attitudes about marijuana
use might lead adolescent respondents to the high-school seniors
survey to be less likely to tell adult interviewers that they
smoked marijuana every day, even if their actual behavior did not
change. The result would be an apparent, but spurious, decline in
heavy marijuana use among adolescents. (This is not to say that
changing attitudes might not also change behavior, only that the
survey evidence is subject to error from this source). </p>

<p>There are no easy answers to the problem of response bias.
Sometimes, as in the studies cited by K. H. Marquis, it is
possible to collect independent data as a check on a sample of
responses, and then adjust the sample results for the measured
bias. Another strategy is to vary the circumstances of response,
for example, by using &quot;secret ballot&quot; answer sheets
instead of face-to-face questioning or by changing the
characteristics of the interviewers. Just as pollsters long ago
discovered that black respondents answered many questions
differently when the interviewers were black, it may be the case
that some adolescents would respond differently to questions
about drug use put by another adolescent - particularly one
dressed and groomed in ways consistent with drug use - than to
the same questions put by an adult. </p>

<p>Changes and Supplements to Current Surveys </p>

<p>Both the household survey and the high-school seniors survey,
conducted by experienced researchers at institutions with
reputations for producing high-quality survey research, are
well-designed for their intended purposes: primarily the
measurement of the number of drug users, secondarily the
measurement of frequency of drug use. But from the perspective of
making drug enforcement policy, and particularly policy to
control organized crime, they do not gather the right data, or
gather it from the right people, or gather it frequently enough.
The most important things surveys can tell us are the quantity of
each drug purchased and consumed; the prices at which those
purchases are made; the identities and relationships of buyers
and sellers; the effects of enforcement on market conditions; and
the effects of market conditions on consumption. In order to
learn these things, surveys would have to: </p>

<p>1. Find More of the Heavy Drug-Users. So much of total drug
consumption is concentrated among a relatively few very heavy
users that no practical increase in sample size for a stratified
random sample among the general population will yield an adequate
sample. For example, the 5,000-person household survey could
expect to get by chance about a dozen of the one half-million
heaviest cocaine users. There are two ways to get a meaningful
sample of heavy users: either use oversampling in drawing
respondents for the household and high-school senior surveys, or
run separate studies of heavy use. The &quot;Young Men and
Drugs&quot; studies show both the feasibility of finding samples
rich in serious drug abusers and the value of the results that
finding such samples can yield. </p>

<p>2. Ask about Prices and Quantities purchased. We would like to
know when the user's last purchase of a given drug took place;
what quantity was involved, plus whatever the purchaser knows or
was told about purity/potency/ quality; and how much money
changed hands; this information is essential to making any
serious estimate of the dollar volume of the market. </p>

<p>3. Ask about the Conditions of the Transaction. Where did the
purchase take place? (The purchaser's residence, the seller's, a
school building, an office building, an apartment corridor, a
park, a street corner?) Were there other people present? Had the
transaction been prenegotiated? Was the price
take-it-or-leave-it, or was there negotiation? Was the
purchaser's previous transaction with the same seller or a
different seller? Is the seller a relative, a close friend, and
acquaintance, or a stranger? These questions can help answer
questions about the possible effectiveness of retail-level
enforcement as a way to cut down on the volume of drugs consumed.
</p>

<p>4. Ask about Price Increases, Shortages, Sharing, and Consumer
Inventories. Was the price of the most recent transaction higher
or lower than the respondent's previous transaction? Than the
respondent expected? If the price of the drug were to increase by
25 percent, what would the respondent do? (Use about the same
amount, use less, quit altogether, switch to another drug?) Has
the respondent ever been unable to find a supply of the drug in
question at any price? Does the respondent now have a supply of
the drug? If so, how long would it last at his normal consumption
rate? How frequently has the respondent used drugs purchased by
another? Given drugs to another? These questions will help
determine the effect of price increases and temporary shortages
on consumption behavior. Unfortunately, experience from market
research on legitimate products suggests that the answers to the
what-if questions are likely to be unreliable. </p>

<p>5. Give Information about Local Markets. Federal and local
enforcement efforts vary widely across the country in their
intensity and success, but there are almost no studies of what
the effects are on retail purchases and consumption. Nationwide
samples need to be supplemented with local ones. </p>

<p>6. Provide a Steady Stream of Data in Addition to Annual or
Once-Every-Two-Years Snapshots. This is particularly valuable in
combination with local data as a way of measuring the difference
enforcement makes (or fails to make). Is the availability of
drugs fairly constant, or does it vary? How do consumers respond?
Estimating the price-elasticity of demand requires frequent
measurements of both price and quantity, both to generate an
adequate number of data points and to avoid confounding price
effects with long-term trends or cohort effects on the demand
side. </p>

<p>One alternative to random sampling often used in market
research is a panel survey, where questions are asked repeatedly
of the same group of respondents. Panel data would be enormously
useful in understanding the effects of market conditions on drug
use, and the individual patterns of drug consumption. For
example, when drug supplies are short, how are consumption
decreases distributed among new users and existing users, poor
users and affluent users, heavy users and light users? What drugs
are used as substitutes when marijuana is scarce or expensive?
How many users, who cease use when supplies are tight, never
start up again, or start up at lower levels of use? An obvious
problem is assuring respondent confidentiality, and convincing
respondents that it is assured. Perhaps more worrisome, being
members of such a panel might make respondents more
drug-conscious, which raises serious ethical questions, as well
as threatening the validity of such studies. </p>

<p>Obstacles </p>

<p>Naturally, proposing such studies for someone else to fund and
carry out is much easier than doing the work. Aside from the
problems of expense and the mass of legal, ethical, and
operational issues raised by asking detailed questions about
illegal transactions, such studies would face several obstacles: </p>

<p>First, they would have to be cleared by the Office of
Management and Budget, which views any expansion of survey
research by the government with a jaundiced eye. The complexity
of the questions to be asked strongly argues for the value of
paying respondents a small fee to encourage them to complete the
interview, but this makes OMB reviewers even more nervous. (The
1981 household survey didn't get into the field until 1982
because of a dispute with OMB about forms and payments to
respondents.) </p>

<p>Second, modifying the existing surveys in terms of content or
sample selection will interfere with the ability of researchers
to compare results from one survey to the next to determine
trends. The preference of survey researchers for asking the same
questions in the same words to the same samples is not mindless
conservatism, but a well-founded belief in the virtues of
repeating measurements exactly, rather than changing survey
series represents a big investment of money and talent. </p>

<p>Finally, it is worth noting that neither the National
Institute on Drug Abuse, which funds the current surveys, nor the
researches who conduct them, share the policy and research
perspective urged here. NIDA is far more interested in the
patterns of drug abuse than in the size and functioning of the
drug markets. Nor is there any demand for this sort of research
from the enforcement and prosecution agencies. </p>

<p>Surveys of Dealers </p>

<p>The discussion above concerns only surveys of drug users. It
is also possible to survey drug dealers, asking both about their
own dealings - transactions, strategies for dealing with
customers, suppliers, and enforcement agencies, incomes,
expenses, encounters, if any, with organized crime, opinions of
enforcement risk, pricing policy, recruitment into the trade,
career patterns and goals - and about their knowledge of how the
drug markets work. There is probably no better way to start on
serious estimates of, for example, bow many marijuana or cocaine
to deliver drugs to the market - is more plausible the fewer the
participants, and the more stable the organizational structure,
of any given market. </p>

<p>Finding and interviewing a sample of dealers poses both
problems and risks for the researcher. However, we do have access
to a sample of drug dealers with nothing better to do than answer
questions: they are in federal and state prisons. Of course, they
may be unrepresentative of the overall dealer population,
particularly in terms of their success in avoiding enforcement,
and may also be unwilling to be interviewed, or to speak
candidly. </p>

<p>Still, if systematic interviews could be conducted with a
sample of convicted drug dealers, the results could not fail to
be informative. The Rand Corporation is now conducting a pilot
study along those lines funded by the National Institute of
Justice. </p>

<p>Consequence Data </p>

<p>One alternative to asking people about their consumption of
illicit substances is to observe the consequences of drug abuse.
These consequences include coming into contact with both the
police (arrests, automobile accidents) and the health care
system: hospital emergency rooms, medical examiners' offices, and
drug treatment facilities. There is now no systematic attempt to
record drug intoxication at arrest or at accident scenes of drug
users, but the National Institute of Drug Abuse maintains three
collection activities to gather medical data: the Drug Abuse
Warning Network (DAWN), the Client-Oriented Data Acquisition
Process (CODAP) and the Community Epidemiology Work Group (CEWG).
</p>

<p>The Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN) </p>

<p>The National Institute on Drug Abuse collects and publishes
[National Institute on Drug Abuse Statistical Series I)
information from about one-sixth of the nation's emergency rooms,
with a heavy concentration on 26 metropolitan areas (SMSA's), and
from about two-thirds of the medical examiners in those 26 SMSA's
only. The emergency rooms report on patients who come in as a
result of acute ill experiences with the non-medical use of
drugs; the medical examiners report on persons who, in their
judgment, died as the direct result of drug use. In 1981, the
most recent year for which the data have been published, the DAWN
system recorded 121,268 emergency room visits and 2,825 deaths,
as a result of drugs. (The deaths exclude New York City, which
did not report to DAWN in 1981; in previous years, New York had
accounted for about one-quarter of DAWN medical examiner
reports.) </p>

<p>DAWN records all drugs used incidents of multiple drug abuse:
thus 121,268 emergency room &quot;episodes&quot; yielded 199,400
&quot;mentions,&quot; and 2,825 deaths involved 5,640 mentions.
Heroin is the third most frequently-mentioned drug in emergency
rooms, after alcohol-in-combination (alcohol alone is now counted
in DAWN) and diazepam (Valium). Cocaine is sixth, marijuana
seventh. Others in the top ten are aspirin, methaqualone,
acetaminophen (Tylenol), flurezapam (another tranquilizer) and
PCP. Heroin, marijuana, and cocaine, the three largest drug
markets in dollar terms, account for fewer than 20,000 total
mentions among them. This is such a tiny proportion of the users
of these drugs (about 1 in 50 heroin users, about 1 in 1,000
cocaine users, about 1 in 5,000 marijuana users) as to make any
inferences from the DAWN sample to the general population
extremely questionable. In any case, other than personal
demographic data, no questions are asked of DAWN subjects other
than &quot;what did you take?&quot; For some drugs, even the
answer to this question may be open to doubt, since illicit drug
sellers frequently misrepresent their wares, and DAWN sites are
not equipped to assay blood or urine to determine the chemical
composition of the &quot;speed&quot; or &quot;ludes&quot; that
subjects report they have taken. </p>

<p>Attempts to base estimates of patterns and trends in drug
availability on DAWN data, but they have not been convincing.
DAWN is valuable as an early warning network about both street
drugs and pharmaceuticals causing injury and death; but it does
not, and almost certainly cannot, contribute much to our
understanding of the kind of drug trafficking that contributes to
organized crime. </p>

<p>The Client Oriented Data Acquisition Process (CODAP) </p>

<p>Through 1981 NIDA gathered data from all federally-funded drug
treatment clinics and programs and published them as NIDA
Statistical Series E. Incentive to participate was provided by
making participation a condition of funding under the NIDA
categorical grant program that paid for drug treatment. The
abolition of that categorical grant program and the inclusion of
drug treatment in the Community Development Block Grant program
of direct fiscal assistance to the states both reduced the total
number of drug treatment facilities and eliminated any direct
relationship between the clinics and NIDA. As a result, NIDA can
mo longer compel participation in CODAP. Approximately 15 states
have voluntarily continued to submit CODAP data, and NIDA
collects the information and prepares am unofficial series of
annual reports. In 1981 there were 249,206 admissions to CODAP
facilities, more than three-fourths for outpatient treatment.
(Persons admitted more than once during the year were
double-counted, so the number of individuals admitted was
somewhat smaller). At any one time there were an average of
126,000 persons under treatment, almost 85 percent as
outpatients. </p>

<p>While CODAP collected demographic data and information about
the drugs for which its clients sought or were assigned to
treatment, it did not collect data about individual purchase and
consumption patterns. Variations in CODAP counts over time might
indicate either increases in abuser populations brought about by
increased availability, growing numbers of addicts without
connections brought about by decreased availability, or merely
increased availability of treatment. CODAP data were of great
interest to treatment professionals and produced interesting
time-series data on such indicators as age at first use (which
allowed some inferences about &quot;cohort effects&quot;).
However, CODAP had even less direct relevance to enforcement
planning than did DAWN. While local studies of enforcement
effectiveness may wish to gather data on treatment demand, this
can probably be done as effectively on an ad hoc basis as through
a process like CODAP. Reviving that process would not seem to be
a high priority from the viewpoint of organized-crime
policymaking. </p>

<p>The Community Epidemiology Work Group (CEWG) </p>

<p>The Community Epidemiology Work Group, also supported by NIDA,
collects reports from drug abuse prevention and treatment experts
and officials around the country about patterns and trends as
they perceive them in their own areas, and summarizes and
publishes those reports in volumes of &quot;Proceedings&quot;.
The local reports are not in standard format, and CEWG does not
generate statistical series. Prices are occasionally mentioned;
quantities rarely, if ever. It is conceivable that CEWG
participants night be encouraged and funded to develop informal
&quot;panel studies&quot; among drug users in their own areas.
But this would represent a substantial move away from CEWG's
current informality. </p>

<p>Changes and Other Studies </p>

<p>As suggested above, drug abuse consequence data have little
promise of contributing much to making or evaluating strategy
against organized crime. The one source not now tapped is arrest
data. Arrests of users - particularly heroin users - for property
crimes and prostitution may be quite sensitive indicators of
short-run changes in availability. To develop such data, it would
be necessary to test arrestees' urine for the presence of opiate
metabolites and quinine. The National Institute of Justice is
funding a few pilot programs along these lines. Assuming they
turn out to be operationally feasible, they probably represent a
wise investment of funds. </p>

<p>Enforcement Data </p>

<p>From the agencies that arrest, prosecute, try, and imprison
drug traffickers and seize their drugs and other assets, we can
gather valuable data both about the enforcement activity and
about the underlying illegitimate market. Some of this
information exists, or can readily be obtained, in statistical
form; the rest is buried in case reports, informant interviews,
and intelligence analyses. The one governmentally-published
series estimating the revenues in the drug markets, the annual
Narcotics Intelligence Estimate, is prepared primarily by
enforcement agencies (particularly DEA) and apparently in large
part from enforcement sources. </p>

<p>Information About Enforcement Activity </p>

<p>Three things about enforcement activity are of interest: </p>

<p>(1) Inputs. What resources - measured in dollars, agent-hours,
prosecutor-hours, cell-years, ship-days, wiretap orders under
Title III - are spent on drug enforcement, and how are those
resources divided among agencies, geographically, by target drug,
by enforcement technique, and by the trafficking activity under
investigation (high-seas smuggling, port smuggling, first
domestic distribution, wholesaling and middleman activity, retail
dealing, money laundering)? </p>

<p>Even at the Federal level alone, something as relatively
simple as a comprehensive dollar budget broken down by agency and
by drug is not available. An attempt has been made to estimate
the share of marijuana in total Federal enforcement; it
illustrates both what is and what is not available. Assembling
such data is best done within the government, by an agency with
the authority to demand the relevant documents, than by
outsiders; the Drug policy Board, the Office of Management and
Budget, the White House Drug Abuse policy Office, any one of the
cognizant Congressional subcommittees, the General Accounting
Office, or the President's Commission on Organized Crime could,
by collating budget submissions from the agencies involved,
assemble crude but adequate estimates of dollars spent by agency
and drug rather easily. </p>

<p>Assembling meaningful information about inputs in non-monetary
forms (e.g., work-hours) would be a tedious process, requiring
both access to internal agency reporting systems and an
understanding of how those systems represent or misrepresent
reality. However, assuming that something resembling the DEA's
annual statistical report is available from the Coast Guard,
Customs Service, IRS, and FBI, it might be possible to assemble a
fair picture of Federal enforcement activity. Federal prosecution
agencies do not now have the ability to generate statistical
profiles of their work that would be useful here. The
case-management software system (PROMIS) being installed in the
U.S. Attorneys' offices may be able to produce estimates of
prosecutive work-hours by case type, although the system may not
code enough of the case data (e.g., G-DEP rank of case and
defendants) to allow useful analysis. </p>

<p>The Administrative Office of U.S. Courts can produce
cases-pending counts by offense, although this overestimates drug
cases as a proportion of total cases to the extent that drug
defendants are more likely than others to default on bail and
thus remain as active cases for long periods of time; no
estimates are made of the use of judge-days or grand jury days
for various kinds of cases. Moreover, since the statute names and
numbers attached to a given drug charge (manufacture,
distribution, conspiracy, continuing criminal enterprise, etc.)
do not vary with drug involved, it is almost impossible to
separate the conviction data by drug. It is possible to make very
crude estimates of Federal prison-cell utilization by convicted
drug dealers from the court data. The attempt to work directly
from DEA data is frustrated by the fact that the DEA statistical
report lists total convictions, rather than convictions in
Federal courts. The lack of a unified set of file numbers for the
federal criminal-justice agencies, or a set of links from one
file system to the next (what is called an &quot;Offender-Based
Tracking system,&quot; or OBTS) makes it nearly impossible to
trace a sample of DEA defendants through prosecution and
incarceration. </p>

<p>The primary problem with assembling such data is not
technical, but organizational: its collection and dissemination
are not in the perceived interests of the agencies involved or
the key individuals within them. While that remains, little
progress is to be expected. Below the Federal level, the
situation is much worse; there are simply no published figures on
drug enforcement spending or activities by state and local police
agencies, most of which do not have separate drug enforcement
units. </p>

<p>The current paucity of data on enforcement activities would
frustrate any attempt to study the effects of changes in
enforcement resources on the drug markets, even if adequate price
and quantity data were in hand. This problem is not easy to fix;
unless the agencies involved have their own reasons for
collecting the data, it will be difficult either for
&quot;outsiders&quot; - even from within the government - to do
the job or to persuade the agencies to do it instead. The
situation is similar for state and local enforcement; in the
absence of any convenient ways of getting nationwide data, a few
studies of individual cities and states might be useful. </p>

<p>(2) Outputs. How do those inputs translate into enforcement
actions felt by traffickers: arrests, convictions, sentences,
time actually served in prison, drug seizures, asset seizures?
How are those outputs distributed geographically, by drug, by
level of the traffic? </p>

<p>These figures are less nebulous than resource and workload
data; a man-hour is &quot;the stuff that dreams are made
on,&quot; but an arrest actually happens. Nonetheless, although
DEA reports its arrests broken down by almost every possible
variable, there is no government-wide collation of all arrest
reports. Convictions and prison time, as noted above, are simply
not available in useful formats. </p>

<p>Even drug seizure data are complicated by the multiplicity of
agencies involved; simply adding together agency totals runs the
risk of double-counting. The first annual report of the Organized
Crime Drug Trafficking Task Force program gives government-wide
numbers that may be reliable. </p>

<p>Data on asset seizures are complicated both by interagency
(and Federal/ State/local) cooperation and by the complexity of
seizure cases: appraised value is one thing, realized value less
lienholders' equity something very different. The lags in
forfeiture actions against seized items, plus the growth in the
overall level of seizures, make it difficult to compute
seizure-to-forfeiture ratios, because 1984 forfeitures do not
correspond to 1984 seizures. Some central responsibility for this
area was assigned to the U.S. Marshal Service and the Asset
Forfeiture Office of the Criminal Division of the Justice
Department; those agencies may now be in a position to provide
unified statistics. </p>

<p>Arrests, convictions, seizures, and prison time are basic
measures of risk imposed on the illicit drug industry, and it is
very hard to plan or evaluate policy in their absence. Unlike
most of the input numbers, good output measures can be assembled
with only minimal cooperation from the agencies themselves, if
someone with authority insists on it. </p>

<p>Below the Federal level the situation is more dismal. Other
than the uninformative counts of total drug arrests in the
Uniform Crime Reports, no national data are available. It has
been almost ten years since the last national study of state
prisoners by offense category, and even that study combined all
drug offenses into one category. Here again, the best that can be
hoped for is a few well-done local studies. </p>

<p>(3) Effects. Enforcement actions impose costs and risks on
illicit entrepreneurs and thus tend to increase prices and
perhaps to make supplies less reliable. To some extent the
cost-imposition value of a given enforcement action - the
imprisonment of a major marijuana importer for an effective term
of six years, the seizure of one kilogram of 90 percent pure
heroin from a New York City wholesaler - can be calculated, and
those costs can be added together to estimate the effects of
enforcement on the market. Such calculations could contribute
substantially to policy analysis and evaluation. They could form
the basis for comparisons of alternative enforcement techniques
in terms of the costs imposed on a given drug market per
government dollar spent. However, to make then accurately one
needs the right kind of tabulation of enforcement outputs. </p>

<p>The value of any illicit drug grows enormously as it moves
down the distribution chain toward the final consumer. A kilogram
of heroin that sells for $200,000 is the raw material for street
bags of heroin worth more than $2 million. Adding together
physical volumes seized at different stages of the traffic is
adding apples and oranges. Each seizure should be evaluated at
the point where it is seized, and then the values added together.
The &quot;street value&quot; calculations, so beloved by
reporters, resemble calculations of the value of stolen cattle
based on the price of a steak dinner in a restaurant. Given
estimates of the &quot;price chains&quot; (of which more below),
simple rules of thumb, based on quantity and location, will give
reasonable estimates of the coast imposed on the illicit market
by drug seizures. Imprisonment data also need to be
quality-weighted. The higher in the trade a trafficker is, the
more dollars he would spend to avoid a year in prison, both
because he has more dollars and because any given period in
prison costs him more in lost earnings. That willingness-to-pay
per prison-year-willingness-to-pay of traffickers at different
levels. But unless the data on imprisonment are collected by drug
and G-DEP violator class, there are no figures to use in
calculation. </p>

<p>Information about Drug Trafficking and Organized Crime </p>

<p>Enforcement activity yields two kinds of information about
drug trafficking: (1) that which can be inferred from the
enforcement statistics, and (2) that known to (and sometimes
published by) agents, prosecutors, and enforcement-agency
intelligence analysts. </p>

<p>(1) Inferences from Enforcement Statistics. Lost in the
organizational history of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics is the
unsung hero who first proposed the rule of thumb that enforcement
agencies capture about 10 percent of the drug supply on its way
to market. That rule of thumb allows (once the problems with the
seizure data are straightened away) a simple calculation of the
physical size of the drug markets: take seizures and add a zero.
More of the official drug market estimation than anyone would
like to admit is still based on some variant of that methodology.
</p>

<p>There are two problems with this calculation. First, there was
never a period when we had a good measure of the total market
traffickers will tend to lower it. In fact, if the change in
enforcement is great enough to cause shifts in basic smuggling
patterns, the result may be a lower overall seizure rate despite
a higher level of enforcement. This seems to have been the case
for the South Florida Task Force, which succeeded both in driving
drug smugglers away from its territory and in causing many of
them to switch from large vessels to smaller, faster vessels;
total seizures actually fell. </p>

<p>The same is true of using other enforcement measures as
estimates of market size. The enforcement success count depends
on the size of the market, the vigor and tactics of enforcement,
and the countermeasures of traffickers. Without an independent
basis for estimating the effect of countermeasures, the success
count tells us little even about trends in the size of the
market. </p>

<p>(2) Facts and Analysis From Agents and Agencies. Drug
enforcement agencies are not in business to collect data or do
analysis; they are in business to put drug dealers in jail and
seize their drugs. Like other agencies, they tend to collect and
publish data that will help them do their job better, will
persuade someone else to help them do their job better, or will
make them look good. </p>

<p>Traditionally, the Drug Enforcement Agency and its
predecessors defined their mission as controlling the supply of
drugs. Thus, for example, the estimates of the price and purity
of heroin at retail were published as part of the
&quot;Performance Measurement System,&quot; implying that drug
availability was an important measure of agency effectiveness.
This mission definition encouraged the development within DEA of
an extensive &quot;strategic intelligence&quot; capability,
devoted to understanding the drug markets. By contrast, the
Federal Bureau of Investigation has always defined its mission as
securing the conviction of lawbreakers. It regarded the number of
bank robbers it caught, rather than the number of bank robberies,
as its central performance measure. Since the 1981 reorganization
that placed DEA under the administrative authority of the
Director of the FBI, DEA's mission definition has moved closer to
the FBI's. At least in part, this reflected a belief that
enforcement outputs were more subject to organizational control,
and thus more likely to consistently reflect organizational
success, than drug market outcomes. This new mission definition
may have advantages from the perspective of organized crime
control. The supply-control approach tended to stress quantities
of drugs rather than trafficking organizations as targets.
However, the new mission definition is much less hospitable to
strategic, as opposed to operational, intelligence. </p>

<p>(a) Price Chains. In the past DEA devoted considerable energy
to estimating &quot;price chains&quot; for drugs, based on
undercover buys and data from informants. That information,
insofar as it was accurate, told a great deal about the structure
of the markets, and in particular about where the money was being
made. It was never formally published, but it was estimated on a
quarterly basis and available to the rest of the government. It
appears that such &quot;price chain&quot; estimates are no longer
made, or no longer made available. If true, that should be
rectified. There is no other source for that information, and it
is essential. There is an enormous amount of relevant information
in DEA case files. Undercover transactions, intercepted
communications, and conversations with informants all contain
price data. The problem is maintaining a staff to collate and
analyze what is there. One improvement that could easily be made
in publishing all statistics on drug prices is to adjust past
prices for the effects of inflation, using the Consumer Price
Index or GNP deflator. Otherwise, anyone trying to determine
price trends has to keep looking up the rate of inflation since
1976, or whatever appropriate date. </p>

<p>(b) &quot;Monitor&quot; Programs. DEA has never had a
substantial number of retail-level cases, but the Performance
Measurement System required data about retail price and purities
for heroin across the country. These were accordingly collected
by the simple expedient of sending agents out to make undercover
retail purchases and collecting retail samples from local police
to seek good quality at low prices? More seriously,
&quot;retail&quot; included samples as large as 2 grams and up to
14 percent pure, while the typical actual retail transaction is
for 100 milligrams (one-tenth of a gram) less than 5 percent
pure. </p>

<p>Now that price-purity data are no longer publicly released,
there seems to be somewhat less monitoring activity than in the
past. It may well be true that a program run by local police
units (perhaps with funding from DEA or NIJ) would be more
effective than DEA-run monitoring efforts. (Unofficial
researchers might develop even more accurate results, but the
legal and ethical problems seem insurmountable). But whether run
by DEA or outside, there is no substitute for actual street buys
as an index of market conditions, and not only for heroin. </p>

<p>Enforcement-based Analysis: NNICC </p>

<p>The National Narcotics Intelligence Consumers Committee
(NNICC, pronounced &quot;nick&quot;) is the official custodian of
estimates regarding the drug markets. It was originally
established to help control the embarrassing flow of mutually
contradictory estimates that used to emerge from various Federal
agencies. Although staffed primarily from DEA, it includes a
broad variety of agencies as members, and its reports are
negotiated products. </p>

<p>At one time, the NNICC annual report, called the Narcotics
Intelligence Estimate, provided sources, physical volumes, and
dollar revenues for each of the four major drug categories:
opiates, cannabis, cocaine, and the &quot;dangerous drugs.&quot;
Subsequently, criticism of the dollar-volume estimates, both from
outsiders and from within the NNICC staff, led to a decision to
cease publication of dollar-volume estimates. At the same time
the marijuana estimates for previous years were restated downward
by approximately one-third. As the NNICC methodology review makes
clear, the NIE figures are largely derived from estimates of
farm-level production in foreign source countries, because the
data sources on the consumption side are so inadequate. However,
that same report shows how weakly grounded the production-based
estimates are. The crop figures themselves are hard to
distinguish from guesswork, and the fraction of each country's
crop reaching the U.S. market is fundamentally unknown. </p>

<p>Still more serious is a problem not considered in the
methodology review: that a large fraction of the total crop in
the average year may go unsold. But a peasant marijuana-grower,
for example, deciding how many plants to grow under uncertainty
both about crop yields and about demand from exporters, will, if
he is rational, overplant on average. Marijuana is so lucrative,
compared with other crops, that it makes sense to grow an extra
plant, even if there is only one chance in five of selling it for
export. Of course, if there were a smoothly functioning
competitive market over wide geographic areas, the result would
be lower prices rather than unsold crops, but the market in
marijuana for export may be highly localized, with exporters
buying from nearby farmers even if prices elsewhere are much
lower. </p>

<p>In general, then, it is hard to place much confidence in the
NIE numbers, particularly because they are presented as a just
set of conclusions, without any detailed presentation of the
underlying data or the calculations performed on that data. One
way to improve this situation would be to gather better data,
particularly about consumption, as discussed above. </p>

<p>On the purely analytic side, two things might be done: (1)
NNICC might publish more of its underlying data and some of the
details about the calculations performed on them, or (2) a team
of outside scholars might be allowed full access to NNICC
materials and asked to prepare an independent estimate. </p>

<p>But whether one considers improving the data with which NNICC
has to work or changing the analytic approach, the fundamental
problem remains one of organizational incentives. The current
lack of adequate data or convincing analysis is not a problem
from the perspective of DEA or other enforcement agencies. If the
information were available, there is no reason to expect that it
would be used to reshape what agents and prosecutors do. In fact,
by providing outsiders with a basis on which to criticize, data
and analysis might seem to threaten agency autonomy. Nor have the
White House or Congressional staffs concerned with these problems
displayed any anxiety over the absence of information. The first
step in solving a problem is getting it identified as a problem
by someone with the resources to bring about a solution. In this
area, that step remains to be taken.<br>

<h1>America's Habit </h1>

<h2>Drug Abuse, Drug Trafficking, &amp; Organized Crime </h2>

<p><b>President's Commission on Organized Crime, 1986 </b></p>

<hr>

<h2>Consultant Paper: Recommendations for the Regulation of
Selected Chemicals and Controlled Substance Analogs </h2>

<p>By Frank Monastero. Submitted: September 1985. Frank Monastero
retired in 1985, having served as the Chief of Operations of the
Drug Enforcement Administration. </p>

<p>As we can see from media reports, cocaine has fast become the
nation's number one drug abuse problem. The supply of cocaine
coming from South America has reached overwhelming proportions.
In 1985 alone the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) estimates
seizures will reach 50,000 pounds, and this, of course, does not
account for that part of the supply that ultimately reaches the
more than 20 million regular users. </p>

<p>Another facet of the drug abuse problem, which could grow as
rapidly if not addressed promptly, is that of controlled
substance analogs, known as &quot;designer drugs.&quot; These are
clandestinely produced substances not covered by the Controlled
Substances Act because of their chemical structure. </p>

<p>Most drugs, including those manufactured illicitly, are
produced at least in part from commercially available chemicals.
The purpose of this paper is to examine the feasibility and
desirability of regulating certain of these chemicals. It will
also analyze how to curtail illicit production and examine what
legal mechanism would be effective to control the manufacture of
synthetic analogs (designer drugs), produced for illicit
purposes. </p>

<p>Cocaine abused in the United States has its origin from the
coca bush, a very hardy plant, grown in certain areas of South
and Central America. As in the case with almost all drugs,
whether produced from plants or totally synthetic, one or more
precursors, reagents or solvents is used in the process. These
chemicals are defined as follows: a precursor is a raw material
used in the production of a controlled substance that becomes
part of the finished product; a reagent reacts chemically with
one or more precursors but does not become part of the finished
product; a solvent, which does not react chemically with a
precursor or reagent and does not become part of the finished
product, is used to dissolve solid precursors or reagents, to
dilute reaction mixtures, and to separate and purify other
chemicals. For example, a precursor for cocaine is coca leaves, a
reagent is sulfuric acid, and a solvent used in the manufacturing
process is acetone. With respect to methamphetamine, a precursor
is phenyl-2-propanone, a reagent is sulfuric acid, and a solvent
is methanol. It is important to understand that, in the case of
these and other controlled substances, there are many other
precursors, reagents and solvents, which can easily be
substituted to produce the same final product. </p>

<p>With some exceptions only the final product drug itself, is a
controlled substance. Many of the chemicals used to produce or
refine illicit drugs are needed in industry to produce a myriad
of items and are produced in tremendous quantities. Controlling
their distribution would, in most cases, be impossible and
probably undesirable because of the cost alone. Acetone, for
instance, which is used as a solvent in processing opium and coca
leaves, is used to make paints, lubricants, pharmaceuticals,
cosmetics and agricultural products. </p>

<p>Although controlling all precursors, reagents and solvents
used to manufacture illicit drugs is neither desirable nor
feasible, the idea of controlling certain chemicals has merit. In
fact, some chemicals are now subject to regulation. Piperidine is
a precursor to the controlled substance phencyclidine, commonly
known as PCP, which can have serious physical and psychological
consequences when abused. Piperidine is subject to reporting
requirements under the Controlled Substances Act, although its
possession and distribution are not subject to penalties, as is
the case with the possession and distribution of PCP. Forms
recording the sale of piperidine and the purchaser's name must be
maintained for two years. Anyone who sells piperidine must report
the sale. This reporting procedure allows DEA to monitor sales of
piperidine and to investigate those sales recognized as
suspicious by either DEA or the seller. As a result of concerted
efforts begun in late 1984, DEA has seized four clandestine PCP
laboratories and has located at least ten operations that
received chemicals from legitimate channels by posing as
legitimate businesses. In one case a manufacturer shipped a
substantial amount of piperidine to a &quot;chemical
company&quot; over an extended period, all in good faith based on
the company's name. A check of the address by DEA showed it to be
an auto repair shop. </p>

<p>Precursors, reagents and solvents are used to manufacture many
drugs, including synthetic analogs, drugs so close in structure
to controlled substances that they create virtually the same
effect for the user. These are not covered under the Controlled
Substances Act because of minor differences in molecular
structure. Synthetic analogs, commonly known as &quot;designer
drugs,&quot; pose particular health threats. </p>

<p>The production of controlled substance analogs,
pharmacologically active, chemically related substances, to avoid
the laws regulating controlled substances, was first observed in
the mid-1960's with the synthesis of amphetamine analogs of
mescaline, such as MDA and others. Some of this group of
hallucinogenic amphetamines sold on the illicit market were
brought under the Drug Abuse Control Amendments, a predecessor to
the Controlled Substances Act. Others in the group were
subsequently controlled under the Controlled Substances Act after
its passage in 1970. Later three PCP analogs were controlled. </p>

<p>The process of designing analogs is, therefore, not new, and
the formulas are not primarily a phenomenon of clandestine
laboratories. Most of these drugs were developed by legitimate
pharmaceutical chemists in search of better medicinal agents
through the testing of numerous analogs of a parent compound. It
is not surprising, therefore, that some of their precursors have
names such as N-(1-phenethyl-4-piperidinyl)-aniline (for
fentanyl) or N-[1-(2-phenylisopropyl)]-4-piperidinone-4-one (for
alpha-methylfentanyl). These analogs, in many cases, mimic the
qualitative actions of the original compound but may vary in
potency or duration of action. Thus, there is a need to deal both
with the problem of chemicals used in the production of illicit
drugs and with the problem of controlled substance analogs. </p>

<p>Factors Affecting the Regulation of Chemicals </p>

<p>There are in excess of 200 precursors, reagents and solvents
used in the production of the 37 most commonly abused substances.
Among these are amphetamines, barbiturates, cocaine, Diazepam,
hash oil, heroin, LSD, MDA, PCP and methaqualone. In considering
what should be regulated two factors are most significant: (1)
How common is the chemical interest? (2) How great is the
workload to track the needed information? Each situation must be
examined individually, if the objective is to reach an ultimate
solution for each drug. </p>

<p>It is quickly apparent that there is no ultimate, universal
solution to absolute chemical control for all drugs. Acetone and
ether, although widely used, are subject to tracing. Piperidine,
less available commercially, is easily synthesized. The first
conclusion might well be that if the source of the chemical is
known and that source will identify and report suspicious sales,
the investigator will be able to pursue the investigation.
Obviously, this will not help when all chemicals can be obtained
from illicit sources. But when the source will provide assistance
or at least when sales information is available for review,
tracing can be attempted. </p>

<p>The problem then becomes one of resources. How much
information can be reviewed and how many people are available to
pursue leads. These are very significant factors to consider. If,
indeed, all chemicals used in the production of controlled
substances were reported it is unlikely the responsible agency
could cull the most suspicious orders, let alone investigate
them. The computer input itself would be substantial.
Furthermore, the drug abuse situation is constantly changing, and
a chemical, not of interest today, might be a prime target as a
new drug emerges. </p>

<p>Case Study: Ether </p>

<p>Because cocaine abuse is a serious problem in the United
States at this time and because an increasing number of cocaine
laboratories are being seized, it is important to examine the
chemical control of cocaine. To refine coca, dried leaves are
moistened with an alkaline solution, such as lime water, sodium
or potassium carbonate. The moistened leaves are soaked in
kerosene, which extracts cocaine and similar compounds. The
kerosene is extracted with aqueous sulfuric acid, and the acid
neutralized with limestone or lime. After the cocaine
precipitates and is removed by filtering, it becomes coca paste.
To become cocaine base, the paste is dissolved in a solution of
sulfuric acid, and a solution of potassium permanganate is added
to aridize impurities. The solution is filtered to remove
impurities and manganese oxides. Anmoniun hydroxide is added to
the filtrate, and the precipitate is collected and dried, forming
the base. The base is dissolved in acetone or ether and filtered
to remove insoluble material. Concentrated hydrochloric acid is
added in acetone along with ether. Cocaine hydrochloride will
crystallize from this solution and is collected by filtration and
dried. The ratio of base to cocaine hydrochloride is one to one. </p>

<p>Because ether and acetone are readily available in the United
States, traffickers recognized the advantage of processing here,
and the number of base to hydrochloride laboratories seized
increased steadily from 3 in 1980 to 21 in 1984; as of mid-1985,
there were already 25. </p>

<p>Six reagents are used to refine cocaine: ammonia, hydrochloric
acid, lime, limestone, potassium carbonate, potassium
permanganate and sulfuric acid. The four solvents used are
acetone, ethanol, ether and kerosene. These could be targets for
monitoring or control. However, after considering the
availability and usage of each chemical, the possible targets can
be narrowed to acetone and ether. As mentioned earlier, acetone
has a number of legitimate uses. An estimated 2.5 billion pounds
is produced each year in the United States, a commercial value of
about $400 million. </p>

<p>There are 12 major U.S. producers and over 40 foreign sources.
Although usually produced from petroleum or synthesized from
benzene, there are other processes to produce it. Nonetheless,
acetone, in fact, was selected as a target, and the targeting did
produce results. Ether, likewise, has broad use, with a U.S.
production estimate of over 60 million pounds, but with only five
U.S. producers and seven major foreign sources. Ether, therefore,
represents, and did turn out to be, an even better target. </p>

<p>Early in 1982 a project was undertaken to determine how much
ether was being shipped to Colombia and to what, if any,
legitimate uses it was put. Colombia was selected because,
although most of the coca is grown in Bolivia and Peru, most of
the cocaine processing laboratories were known to be in Colombia.
The Colombian government determined that thousands of gallons of
ether were being imported annually, but that there was virtually
no legitimate need for it. Most of the ether was imported from
the Federal Republic of Germany and the United States. Through
liaison with those ether manufacturers and distributors who would
cooperate, hundreds of barrels of the chemical were tracked to
clandestine laboratories deep in the Amazon jungles of Colombia.
Many of these labs were destroyed and thousands of pounds of
cocaine were seized. In the celebrated Tranquilandia raid in
March 1984, 10,000 kilograms of cocaine paste and base were
seized and destroyed, along with thousands of barrels of
chemicals. Through court testimony and media attention, cocaine
producers have, no doubt, become aware of the detection
techniques used to locate laboratories, and they are or will take
action to avoid detection. Opportunities for a continuing supply
of ether exist through unscrupulous manufacturers and
distributors and through clandestine production from ethanol.
However, the program has been useful and demonstrates the
effectiveness of the monitoring approach. </p>

<p>Case Study: P2P </p>

<p>In addition to tracking chemicals, such as ether, another
approach is to bring certain chemicals under the Controlled
Substances Act. For experience with this approach, it is
important to examine methamphetamine and one of its precursors,
phenyl-2-propanone (P2P). Domestic methamphetamine production is
significant. In fact, during a 45 month period beginning in
September 1981, more than 50 percent of the 751 clandestine
laboratories seized by DEA were methamphetamine labs. In order to
control clandestine methamphetamine production, P2P was placed in
Schedule II of the Controlled Substance Act on February 11, 1980.
P2P is an immediate precursor (used in the step just prior to
completion) in the most desirable synthesis and was, therefore, a
good choice for targeting. Furthermore, with the exception of its
use as a cleaning solution, most of its uses are in connection
with pharmaceutical manufacturing. Annual production in the U.S.
is estimated to be about 10,000 pounds, with only two principal
domestic producers and nine foreign sources. Full control of P2P
under the Control Substances Act resulted in a significant
increase in the number of clandestine methamphetamine laboratory
operators synthesizing P2P. More than 75 percent of the
laboratories seized after passage were refluxing phenylacetic
acid and acetic anhydride with sodium acetate or pyridine. In
addition, one laboratory was synthesizing phenylacetic acid as
well. </p>

<p>Recommendations for Action </p>

<p>(1) That legislation be enacted requiring the reporting of all
sales of selected chemicals used in the production of controlled
substances, subject to public notice by the Administrator of DEA
that a particular chemical was selected for such control. This
would create a requirement similar to that affecting piperidine;
however, reporting would only be required for those chemicals
specified for a particular period of time. The requirement should
apply to the importing and exporting of the specified chemicals. </p>

<p>(2) That legislation be enacted to empower the Administrator
of DEA or some other appropriate authority to identify and add
new chemicals to the list of those requiring reporting, as it
becomes known they are being used for the production of
controlled substances. </p>

<p>(3) That DEA identify the resources needed for the
computerization, analysis and follow up on reporting and that
those resources be acquired through the budget process. </p>

<p>Controlled Substance Analogs </p>

<p>As previously stated, the controlled substance analog problem
is not new. However, their wider illicit use and the greater
recognition of their use has heightened concern. There have been
three major types of analogs available in the United States:
analogs of PCP, analogs of amphetamine and methamphetamine having
hallucinogenic properties, and the newer trend, analogs of
fentanyl and meperidine. There are, of course, hazards common to
all three groups. They are likely to contain toxic impurities.
Dosage is not consistent, i.e., one dose of a substance is likely
to contain a different amount of the active ingredient than
another. As a result, a single dose could contain a lethal amount
of the drug in question. Because they are analogs, they may well
produce toxic effects not caused by their parent drug. Another
critical consideration associated with designer drugs is the
difficulty of identifying them in the body. Recent testimony at a
Senate hearing indicated there are now only two laboratories in
the country, capable of identifying certain &quot;designer
drugs&quot; in body fluids, because standards for identifying the
drugs are not widely available. This creates two serious
problems: (1) Without the ability to detect and determine what
drugs are being used on the street it is impossible to even
identify that a problem exists let alone judge its magnitude; and
(2) without being able to determine positively what drugs has
been ingested, it is impossible to identify the correct antidote,
which in many cases could be a matter of life and death. </p>

<p>The Situation in More Detail </p>

<p>PCP was originally developed in the early 1950's as an
anesthetic for humans, but it was soon limited to veterinary use
because of its adverse side effects. Licit production ceased in
1978, and PCP is controlled in Schedule I of the Controlled
Substances Act, as are three of its analogs. They now are
recognized as having no medical use. The National Institute on
Drug Abuse has identified 35 other analogs, but none has
presented an abuse problem as far as is known. </p>

<p>Many analogs of amphetamine and methamphetamine are known to
have hallucinogenic affects. One receiving considerable media
attention recently, known on the street as &quot;Ecstasy,&quot;
is MDMA or 3,4-methylene dioxymethamphetamine from the parent
compound MDA. Its psychopharmacological effects are similar to
those of MDA, altered consciousness, increased acoustic, visual
and tactile sensory perceptions and mild intoxication. There is
considerable concern among some experts that MDMA is likely to
cause damage to the serotonergic system, which has to do with
regulating sleep, mood, sexual activity and sensitivity to
aversive stimuli. The conclusion is based on research indicating
that MDA can selectively destroy serotonergic nerve terminals in
the rat brain. First recognized in the illicit traffic by DEA in
1970, MDMA was proposed for control under the Controlled
Substances Act in July 1984 because of increasing incidents of
discovery. However, because of rapidly mounting evidence of abuse
since then and possible serious neurological damage, the
emergency provisions contained in the Comprehensive Crime Control
Act of 1984 were used, and the drug was controlled as of July 1,
1985. </p>

<p>Fentanyl is widely used by the medical community as an
analgesic and anesthetic. It was first marketed in the United
States for this purpose in 1968 and is the most popular analgesic
used in surgical procedures in this country. There are likely
several hundred fentanyl analogs, many with pharmacological
properties similar to heroin or morphine but far more powerful.
The alpha-methyl analog was the first synthetic analog drug
recognized in the illicit traffic and was associated with
overdose deaths in California in 1979. Sold on the streets as
synthetic heroin, or &quot;China White,&quot; it was placed in
Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act in September 1981,
substantially eliminating its appearance in the illicit traffic.
DEA has identified seven additional fentanyl analogs in the
illicit traffic since then, however. Interestingly, two analogs
have not been recognized in the scientific literature. </p>

<p>There are two dramatic concerns related to the fentanyl
analogs: (1) their potency; and (2) their production/profit
margin. This second element will be of obvious importance to
traditional organized crime elements. Three methyl-fentanyl, the
latest analog to appear in the illicit market, is 3,000 times as
potent as morphine and has already been responsible for over a
dozen overdose deaths in the San Francisco Bay area alone. This
is the highest rate of fentanyl related deaths to date. Dosages
for fentanyl analogs are measured in micrograms and are likely to
be less than 1 percent of the dosage unit sold to the user. The
Drug Enforcement Administration has estimated that one kilogram
of fentanyl analog could be manufactured for under $2,000 and
that this amount might equal as many as 50 million dosage units,
with a street value exceeding one billion dollars. </p>

<p>Meperidine, a synthetic narcotic used to control pain, is
frequently used by heroin users when the street supply of heroin
is low. Meperidine, known more commonly by its trade name
&quot;Demerol,&quot; is in the Controlled Substances Act,
Schedule II. Two analogs of meperidine have been found in current
use. The first apparent MPPP (1-Methyl-4-Propionoxy piperidine)
abuse came to light in 1976 when a young man synthesized what he
thought was the analog for his own use. He soon sought treatment
for symptoms of Parkinson's disease. In revealing his drug use he
provided the formula and procedures he had used. Subsequent
analysis revealed he had, in fact, created MPTP. Additional
research by a National Institute of Health grantee showed that
MPTP had produced the Parkinson's type symptoms. MPPP was first
identified by a DEA laboratory in 1982; and samples of MPPP have
been discovered to contain the neurotoxic byproduct MPTP, formed
during the synthesis of MPPP. The neurological damage produced by
MPTP is irreversible and apparently worsens with time. The State
of California has identified more than 500 people who have used
MPTP; many users thought it was a new synthetic heroin. Twenty of
those involved have been permanently crippled. A group of seven
young addicts, who appeared at a California medical center
several years ago with symptoms resembling advanced Parkinson's
disease, were unable to move or talk. Treatment with
anti-Parkinson's therapy was, according to California
authorities, probably life saving, yet the patients continued to
be severely handicapped, requiring medication every one to three
hours just to be able to eat and drink. </p>

<p>The other meperidine analog with effects similar to heroin is
PePAP (l-(2-Phenylethyl)-4-Acetyloxpiperidine). The analgesic
potency of PePAP, measured in rodents, is described as from 12 to
72 times the potency of meperidine itself. This analog has so far
been discovered in California, although a clandestine laboratory
operation in Texas may have been attempting the process but did
not succeed. </p>

<p>Proposed Legislation </p>

<p>As mentioned at the outset of this discussion, unless the
specific chemical makeup of the substance being abused can be
determined by all laboratories regularly engaged in the analysis
of substances being abuse, serious problems could go unrecognized
for long periods, even years. Those who examine for and record
overdose deaths and injuries must likewise be able to determine
the abused substance involved. Further, that information must be
collected and analyzed at a central point. There is currently
only a limited mechanism for this collection (the NIDA DAWN
system). When a situation needing attention is discovered,
enforcement authorities must be empowered to act quickly. This
means that a mechanism must exist by which these &quot;designer
drugs&quot; can be controlled under the Controlled Substances Act
and appropriate State laws. The Comprehensive Crime Control Act
of 1984 does contain such a provision. Under that statute the
Administrator of DEA can bring a drug under Schedule I for up to
one year, with a six month extension where justified, and on
emergency basis, while the normal control mechanism is in
progress. The Administrator must decide that such scheduling is
necessary to avoid an imminent hazard to public safety. Control
of the substances occurs 30 days after public notice. The
efficacy of this legislation is yet undetermined, since it was
only first used in the Spring of 1985. </p>

<p>On July 16, 1985, a bill was introduced in the U.S. Senate, S.
1437, known as the &quot;Designer Drug Enforcement Act of
1985.&quot; This proposed legislation would make it a felony to
manufacture or distribute a designer drug for human consumption.
The proposed act, which would amend the Controlled Substance Act,
reads in part &quot;(31) The term 'designer drug' as used in
section 403A means a substance other than a controlled substance
that has a chemical structure substantially similar to that of a
controlled substance in Schedule I or II.&quot; During a Senate
hearing on the legislation by the Subcommittee on Children,
Family and Drugs and Alcoholism, July 25, 1985, both the DEA
Administrator and the Administrator of the Alcohol, Drug Abuse
and Mental Health Administration, supported the bill. </p>

<p>Recommended Actions </p>

<p>(1) That DEA provide assistance to the States in acquiring
laboratory standards for use in identifying &quot;designer
drugs.&quot; </p>

<p>(2) That legislation be enacted requiring the reporting by
anyone authorized to sign a death certificate, to an appropriate
Federal authority (perhaps the Public Health Service) of deaths
caused wholly or in part from the ingestion of any substance. </p>

<p>(3) That legislation be enacted requiring the reporting to an
appropriate Federal authority (DEA) by all laboratories
performing drug analysis for law enforcement purposes: (a) the
total amount of each controlled substance as defined in the
Controlled Substances Act, received for analysis each calendar
year, and (b) immediate notice of the receipt of samples of any
substance suspected of being or found to be a &quot;designer
drug&quot; as defined in the proposed bill. </p>

<ol>
    <li>That DEA formulate model &quot;designer drug&quot;
        legislation for the States as has been done for other
        aspects of the drug abuse problem. </li>
</ol>

<h2>Drug Abuse, Drug Trafficking, &amp; Organized Crime </h2>

<p><b>President's Commission on Organized Crime, 1986 </b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Consultant Paper: Part 1: Drug Policy and Organized Crime </h2>

<p>Drug Policy and Organized Crime </p>

<p>By Professor Mark H. Moore. Submitted: January 3, 1986. Dr.
Mark H. Moore is Daniel and Guggenheim Professor of Criminal
Justice Policy and Management at the John F. Kennedy School of
Government, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts. He is
former Special Assistant to the Administrator of the Drug
Enforcement Administration. </p>

<p>Introduction: Drug Policy, Law Enforcement and Organized Crime
</p>

<p>Criminal laws prohibiting the production, distribution, and
possession of narcotics and dangerous drugs are the basis of drug
policy in the United States. These laws target the drugs that
have no recognized legitimate medical uses: heroin, cocaine,
marihuana, and hallucinogens. Enforcement efforts against these
drugs can be uncompromising, for there are no legitimate uses or
users to be protected. </p>

<p>Other drugs, however, pose similar threats to public health
and welfare, but they do have recognized legitimate uses. These
drugs include morphine, methadone, barbiturates, amphetamines,
and tranquilizers. With respect to these drugs the aim of the
legal regime and associated enforcement strategies is more
complex. It is not simply to eliminate the drugs but to preserve
a legitimate sector in which the benefits of these drugs may be
enjoyed, while minimizing illicit use. Towards this end the laws
license a limited number of people to produce, import, sell,
distribute and use them. To prevent the drugs from leaking from
and to illicit distributors and users, licensees have to secure
their inventories, and deal only with other licensees. To make
sure that the licensees meet these responsibilities, they must
keep records and make them available to investigators for
inspection. Failures to meet their responsibilities expose the
licensees to both civil and criminal penalties. To make sure that
no one can operate outside the boundaries of the legitimate
system, the unlicensed production, distribution or use of these
legitimate drugs is prohibited. </p>

<p>Drug Laws as a Comprehensive Drug Policy </p>

<p>It has become customary to think of the drug laws as operating
principally on the &quot;supply side&quot; of illegal drug
markets. For most practical purposes this is appropriate, for
these laws are the principal policy instruments directed at the
supply of illicit drugs. It is also generally true that the
principal targets of enforcement are suppliers rather than users.
However, these laws impose criminal liability on the illicit
possession and use of drugs, as well as to illicit production and
distribution. And indeed, each year more than 500,000 drug users
are arrested for possession. Therefore, criminal enforcement is
directed at the &quot;demand side&quot; of illicit drug use as
well as the &quot;supply side.&quot; To the extent that these
laws attack both the supply and the demand for illicit drugs,
they can be understood as a comprehensive drug policy, designed
to distinguish legitimate and useful drug use from illicit use
and to minimize illicit use in the society. </p>

<p>To produce this result, three different mechanisms are relied
on. One is the moral force of the law itself. To the extent that
individual citizens are guided in their decisions about drug use
by the explicit instruction provided by the law, or to the extent
that the existence of the law mobilizes widespread informal
interventions by parents, friends and relatives, the existence of
laws that define illicit use may succeed in reducing overall
levels of illicit use without any public enforcement activities. </p>

<p>A second, more widely understood mechanism is general
deterrence: the notion that citizens might be discouraged from
illicitly selling or using drugs by the fear that they will be
arrested and punished. This notion differs from the first in that
it depends on citizens' fears of punishment to motivate
compliance with the laws, rather than their desires to conform or
seek virtue. The more severe the penalties, and the higher the
probability of being caught, the more compliance will result. </p>

<p>A third mechanism is incapacitation: the notion that
imprisonment may physically prevent drug dealers and users from
continuing their activities. This concept differs from the second
in that it operates only on those dealers and users who are
caught, and only for as long as they remain under legal
supervision. If enough drug dealers and drug users are locked up,
then the problem of illicit drug dealing and drug use will
disappear. </p>

<p>Limitations of Drug Laws as a Drug Abuse Policy </p>

<p>To describe these mechanisms is to reveal the limitations of
the drug laws as a comprehensive drug abuse policy. The problem
is not that they are directed only at the &quot;supply side&quot;
of illegal drug abuse. Nor is it that they fail to produce
reductions in the level of illicit drug use. The problem is that
the drug laws are imperfectly effective. They leave behind a
residual market, composed of drug dealers and users, who failed
to get the message that they should abandon their drug
activities. Moreover, while the levels of drug distribution and
use that remain are undoubtedly lower than they would be in a
world of legalized drugs, the character of the market on both the
supply and the demand side are fundamentally altered and
generally worsened as a result of their illegality. </p>

<p>On the demand side the users who are not dissuaded from using
drugs discover that they confront high prices and low quality in
the drugs they buy. In addition, they are exposed to social
stigmatization and criminal prosecution. These circumstances
produce disastrous results for their economic status, physical
health, and social well-being. Of course, to the extent that
these consequences are unpleasant to the users, they provide a
continuing incentive for users to abandon their drug use. And, to
the extent that the users do so, an important social objective is
achieved. But to the extent they do not respond, their lives are
made miserable with little corresponding social benefit. The
society is left with drug users who are more dependent, dangerous
and unhealthy than they would otherwise be. </p>

<p>On the supply side the residual capacity takes the form of an
illicit industry. Some of that industry operates outside the
boundaries of the United States, and therefore to some degree
beyond the reach of its law. Another portion operates under the
cover of predominantly legal drug production and distribution -
within reach of the law, but a morally and legally ambiguous
target. The vast majority of the illicit industry, however,
consists of wholly illicit traffickers in the United States. </p>

<p>The Illicit Drug Industry: A Problem for Drug and Organized
Crime Policy </p>

<p>The existence of this illicit industry creates two different
kinds of problems. Viewed from the vantage point of drug abuse
policy, the principal problem created by the illicit industry is
that it continues to supply drugs to illicit markets. To the
extent that this continues, old drug users nay continue their
harmful activities, and new users may be recruited into dangerous
patterns of drug use. Thus, to achieve the objectives of drug
policy, the society must find ways to constrict the supply
capacities of the illicit industry. </p>

<p>Viewed from the vantage point of those concerned with the
control of organized crime, the existence of the illicit industry
creates a different kind of problem. To a degree, the illicit
drug industry engages in the sort of activities that make
organized crime a specially important social problem. Not only do
the illegal dealers frustrate the aims of drug policy by
continuing to supply drugs, but they grow rich in the process and
taunt the society with their financial success. Moreover, the
industry seems to spawn violence. Sometimes the violence spills
out into the general population. But even when the violence
remains confined to participants in the industry, its sheer
viciousness creates a general sense of lawlessness and brutality
that is threatening to the community. The illicit dealers also
seem to become heavily involved in corrupting government
agencies. Such activities undermine community security, and the
integrity of its basic institutions. Finally, the illicit drug
industry may gives birth to unusually large and powerful criminal
organizations, or nourish those that already exist. From the
vantage point of organized crime policy, then, the drug laws
create a major problem to be solved. </p>

<p>Drug Policy as a Portfolio of Policy Instruments </p>

<p>To deal with these side effects and residual problems, the
drug laws must be complemented by other policy instruments. To
deal with the limitations of drug laws in suppressing the demand
for drugs, a comprehensive drug policy necessarily includes drug
treatment and preventive education programs. Treatment programs
must be provided to help users make the transition to non-use and
to save lives that would otherwise be lost. Preventive education
programs must be operated to give more detailed explanations to
individuals of why illicit drug use is undesirable. Indeed, given
the focus of drug enforcement on the supply side of the market
and the obvious limitations of the drug laws in discouraging use
among those who are already dependent, it is generally
appropriate to think of drug treatment and education programs as
the principal instruments focused on the &quot;demand side&quot;
of the illicit drug markets. </p>

<p>To deal with the limitations of the laws in suppressing the
supply of illicit drugs and preventing the appearance of
organized criminal activity, traditional enforcement methods must
be supplemented by some special policy instruments. Diplomacy and
foreign aid must be joined to enforcement and regulation to reach
the pieces of the illicit supply system that operate outside the
United States. An effective regulatory enforcement system must be
created to prevent the diversion of narcotics and dangerous drugs
from legitimate to illicit markets in the United States. And
perhaps some special enforcement strategies that are effective in
constricting the capacity of the supply system to move drugs to
illicit markets or in dispersing well organized drug traffickers
must be designed and used. </p>

<p>The Objectives of the Paper </p>

<p>The purpose of this paper is not to design an effective
overall drug policy. Nor is it to consider the wisdom of relying
on criminal laws against drug distribution and use to the degree
we do now. My opinion is that our current drug policy is a wise
one, and that the balance of risks favors the continuation of
criminal laws directed against the distribution and use of
narcotics and dangerous drugs. </p>

<p>The aim of this paper is to take the existence of the current
drug laws and policies as a starting point and to design a
strategy to reduce supply consistent with the aims of our current
drugs abuse policy. In designing such a policy, special attention
will be given to the relationship between the strategy to reduce
supply that is necessary to achieve the goals of our current drug
abuse policy and organized crime policy. </p>

<p>As we have seen, there is some tension between these policies.
Making drug distribution illegal establishes fertile soil from
which existing organized crime groups might take sustenance or
new groups might arise. Thus, the continuing prohibitions of drug
distribution may exacerbate the organized crime problem. On the
other hand, to the extent that organized crime groups are now
active in producing or distributing drugs, and to the extent that
our organized crime policy makes available resources and
techniques that are effective in immobilizing such groups,
organized crime policy may make an important contribution to drug
policy. </p>

<p>In balancing these concerns the dominant emphasis will be
given to designing a supply reduction strategy that can achieve
the purpose of drug abuse policy. This perspective will be
adopted not because it is obvious that an effective drug control
policy is more important than an effective organized crime
policy, but simply because, if it were true that it was more
important to combat organized crime than to keep drugs from
illicit users, the simple solution would be to legalize the drugs
so that no illegal firms could arise. Since the society does not
choose this option, it must be that we are willing to pay a price
in terms of the objectives of organized crime policy to achieve
the objectives of drug control policy. The only interesting
questions, then, are how to minimize that price, and how best to
deploy the special resources and capabilities or organized crime
control policies to further the objectives of drug policy. That
is what we will try to discover. </p>

<p>The Analytic Framework </p>

<p>As we have seen, the character of the illicit drug industry is
important to the ultimate success of both drug abuse policy, and
organized crime control policy. To define objectives, set
reasonable expectations for success, and guide strategic choices
in targeting supply reduction efforts, an analysis of the illicit
drug industry is essential. </p>

<p>The Crucial Distinction Between the &quot;Industry&quot; and
the &quot;Firms&quot; </p>

<p>In carrying out this analysis, it is important to distinguish
the concept of the industry from the concept of individual firms
within the industry. The industry includes everyone who is
engaged in producing, importing, or distributing narcotics and
dangerous drugs to illicit markets in the United States. A firm
within that industry is nothing more than a collection of assets
whose specific uses are determined by the authoritative decisions
of an identifiable organizational unit. </p>

<p>Obviously, the firms that make up the industry could take a
variety of forms. They could represent different production
capacities, such as a boat, a person who knows the chemistry to
produce psychoactive drugs, or $50,000 in cash. They could be
involved in all aspects of the deal from financing through
production, transportation, and distribution, or they could
specialize in only one of these functions. For any given function
the firm may be more or less dominant in more or less local
geographic markets. They could consist of a single entrepreneur
linked to others only through the fragile ties of economic
interest, or they could include many people linked to one another
by family or cultural ties. They could be relative newcomers or
have a long history in the industry. They could enter the
industry with hopes for a single, big score, or they could plan
to become or remain a permanent fixture. </p>

<p>Often, the distinction between the industry and the firms that
comprise it is blurred, and the industry is viewed as a single
firm. This casual assumption is justified on one of two different
grounds. One is that the observed performance of the illicit
market is so impressive in terms of its operations and
adaptability that it is hard to believe that it is not guided by
a single intelligence. Nothing short of a single coherent
enterprise could accomplish the enormously complicated tasks of
collecting raw materials, processing then, and transporting the
finished product through the mine fields created by enforcement
agencies. Nor could anything other than an enterprise guided by a
single intelligence adapt successfully to the frequent changes in
supply reduction strategies. </p>

<p>The problem with this argument is that legitimate industries
accomplish similar feats of production, distribution and
adaptation all the time without a single intelligence guiding
them. The reason legitimate industries are successful is that
there are many guiding intelligences, but none predominant. The
aggregate result of the individual choices made by individual
economic actors may look organized in the sense that the industry
gradually moves from places where enforcement has become heavy to
areas where it is weaker, or it shifts from one drug to another
depending on consumer demand. But this orderly response need not
be the result of a wise choice by a single, powerful firm. It
could be the natural result of the firms in the heavily enforced
areas being wiped out, and the firms in the less heavily enforced
areas growing to meet the demand. In short, the adaptations are
made at the expense of individual firms, not under their control
- nor, necessarily, to their advantage. </p>

<p>The second line of argument supporting the notion that the
industry should be viewed as a single firm is somewhat more
sophisticated. It is based on the hypothesis that some illicit
firms will develop crucial specialized capabilities, and that
these will give the firm important advantages in producing and
distributing illegal drugs, or effective control over others who
do. These special capabilities could be access to capital,
connections with foreign sources of raw materials, knowledge of
how to produce the drugs, a special tie to corrupt officials, or
a general capacity for disciplined violence that could be brought
to bear on anyone who produced or distributed drugs without their
permission. This argument depends essentially on the idea that
there are some natural economies of scale in the illicit
industry, and that these will tend to produce a concentrated
industry. This is a more powerful kind of argument than the
first, but it is only an assertion. It needs to be examined with
both logic and evidence. </p>

<p>The Analysis of Industrial Organization </p>

<p>The form of analysis that is appropriate is an analysis of
industrial organization. An analysis of this kind rigorously
maintains the distinction between the industry and the firms that
comprise it. Indeed, the principal objective of an analysis of
industrial organization is to understand the relationships among
the structure of the industry, the conduct of the firms within
the industry, and the long run performance of the industry. </p>

<p>The Definition of Industry Structure. The concept of industry
&quot;structure&quot; explicitly captures the distinction between
the industry and the firms that comprise it. It focuses attention
on how the activities of the overall industry are divided among
different organizational units called Firms. One key concern in
examining structure is the degree of concentration in the
industry. The fewer the firms, the more concentrated the
industry. A second is the extent of horizontal and vertical
integration. Integration refers to the proportion of activities
essential to creating a product and delivering it to a market
that are contained within a single firm. Vertical integration is
measured by the extent to which a firm includes all the steps
from extraction of raw materials to final sales to ordinary
consumers. Horizontal integration is measured by the proportion
of a given step in the production and distribution of a product
that is controlled by a single firm. </p>

<p>The Definition of Industry Conduct. &quot;Conduct&quot; refers
to the distinctive ways that the firms within the industry go
about their business. Specific questions might focus on the
production technologies now commonly utilized, major factors
influencing costs within the industry, levels of investment in
research and development, the rate at which new products are
introduced, or the geographic organization of the industry's
markets. Conduct might also be concerned with institutional
relationships in the industry; e.g., the competitive strategies
being pursued by firms within the industry, the relationships
with governmental regulators, and even patters of collective
bargaining and labor relations. </p>

<p>The Definition of Industry Performance.
&quot;Performance&quot; focuses on the question of how successful
the industry is over the long run in delivering a product at low
cost, expanding the market, and adapting to changing
circumstances. Performance is ultimately what an industry analyst
is trying to understand. Indeed, the observations about structure
and conduct are made principally to explain and predict
performance. The more decentralized and competitive the industry,
and the lower the costs of bringing new products or new
production technologies on line, the more adaptable and dynamic
the industry. The larger the economies of scale in operating,
marketing, or bringing new products or production technologies on
line, the more concentrated the industry is likely to be. The
more concentrated the industry, the higher the prices and the
slower the rate of innovation. Propositions such as these link
observations of structure and conduct to explanations and
predictions of performance. </p>

<p>Objectives in Attacking the Illicit Drug Industry </p>

<p>To a great extent this framework of analysis can be carried
over and used in examining the character of the illicit drug
industry. But some crucial differences are worth noting. By far
the most important is that the implicit evaluative perspective
reverses when we are analyzing illicit industries. </p>

<p>An Evaluative Perspective. In standard industry analyses one
generally hopes for high performance from the industry. The more
successful it is in delivering products at low prices, expanding
its market to new areas, adapting to changing economic
circumstances, and maintaining high rates of innovation, the
better the result for the society. </p>

<p>In the case of the illicit drug industry, of course, the
society's hopes run in the opposite direction. High performance
from the illicit drug industry means that it adapts well to
government efforts to eliminate it and continues to supply drugs
at low cost to illicit markets. Over the long run, this means
higher levels of illicit drug use. In analyzing the illicit drug
market, then, what one hopes for is a failing industry: one that
cannot overcome the hurdles set by the government in trying to
get its products to market. These hopes are generally frustrated
by the sheer inventiveness and adaptability of illicit
entrepreneurs in pursuit of money. Nonetheless, one keeps hoping
that this industry will stumble rather than flourish. Indeed,
making it fail is an explicit purpose of public policy. </p>

<p>A second important difference is that in the analysis of the
illegal drug industry, the structure and conduct of the industry
have an elevated importance. As noted above, in traditional
analyses of industrial organization, structure and conduct have
importance primarily as factors that influence the performance of
the industry. In the analysis of the illegal drug industry, they
retain that importance: to the extent that structure and conduct
enhance or hinder the industry's long-run performance in
delivering drugs to illicit markets at low prices, they are a
source of interest, and a possible target of enforcement actions.
</p>

<p>What increases the importance of structure and conduct in the
analysis of illegal drug markets, however, is that they are
valued by the society independently of their impact on the
performance of the industry. Crucial questions about the conduct
of the firms within the illegal drug industry include the extent
to which they rely on violence to maintain internal discipline or
eliminate competition, and the extent to which they rely on
corruption to ward off the threat of enforcement. To the extent
that they do rely on violence and corruption as essential
elements of their business, their conduct has importance to the
society quite apart from how these practices affect their ability
to supply drugs. </p>

<p>Similarly, the society seems to be deeply concerned about the
structure of the illicit drug industry. Specifically, the society
seems to regard the problem as worse if the industry is highly
concentrated and composed of a few large, durable firms than if
it were less concentrated and populated by smaller and more
transient firms. No doubt, this view derives primarily from a
dominant concern about the performance of the industry, and an
assumption that an illicit industry, composed of a few large and
durable firms, would be more effective over the long run in
supplying drugs at low cost to consumers. It is important to keep
in mind, however, that a highly concentrated industry might
perform less well over the long run in delivering drugs to
illicit markets than a more atomistic market. Economic theory
tells us that prices would be higher in a concentrated market,
and it is quite possible that innovativeness and adaptability to
attacks would be less. The firms might represent more formidable
enforcement targets, but the result of dismantling them might be
larger and more durable than would be true in an atomistic
market. </p>

<p>Even if this were true, however, it seems likely that the
society would still regard an illicit industry, composed of a few
large, durable firms, as worse than one composed of many small
transient firms. The reason is that large, durable firms
constitute a social problem independent of their ability to
supply drugs. Large, durable criminal organizations can bring
much more powerful pressures to bear on their employees,
competitors, the government officials who are pledged to attack
them, and even the communities in which they operate than could
smaller or more transient firms. It is partly that the large,
durable firms become very wealthy; partly that they can maintain
truly frightening capacities for disciplined violence; but
perhaps most fundamentally that they will be around for a long
time and therefore able to reward cooperation and punish
opposition that makes them so powerful. </p>

<p>Thus, the concepts of structure, conduct and performance help
to clarify the society's objectives in dealing with the illicit
drug industry. The concerns of drug abuse policy are captured
principally by questions about the performance of the industry,
since it is the long run performance of the industry that will
decisively shape overall levels of drug abuse. The concerns of
organized crime policy are captured principally by questions
about conduct and structure. The concept of conduct captures the
concern about levels of violence and corruption associated with
an illegal industry. The concept of structure captures the
special concerns that are raised for organized crime policy by
the existence of very large, durable organizations, whose wealth,
disciplined use of violence, and long memories make them
especially powerful. A successful supply reduction strategy,
then, would leave an illicit drug industry, which is high cost,
ineffective in supplying drugs to illicit markets, not very
adaptable, reluctant to rely on bribery and violence, and
composed of small, transient firms. </p>

<p>Competition among Objectives. We are accustomed to thinking
that any supply reduction strategy will move us towards improved
performance on all of these objectives, and therefore there are
no trade-offs between the objectives of drug abuse policy and
organized crime control policy. We have already seen that there
is a certain tension between the aims of these two different
policies insofar as the criminal laws against drug distribution
and use create the basic conditions under which an illicit
industry night arise. But now it is possible to see a new tension
as well, one that is not only between drug abuse policy and
organized crime control objectives, but also between different
objectives of organized crime control policy. </p>

<p>Ironically, a supply reduction strategy that increased the
degree of concentration in the illicit industry might achieve
some important objectives of a supply reduction strategy.
Economic theory predicts, for example, that the actual supply of
drugs will be less in a concentrated industry than in a more
decentralized competitive industry. It is also likely that the
violence would be less, or at least more disciplined and focused
on those who were actually involved in the industry in a tightly
organized, concentrated industry. Thus, a supply reduction
strategy might succeed in reducing the overall performance of the
industry and even changing its conduct to reliance on threats and
bribery rather than overt violence, but do so only at the price
of increasing the size, power, and durability of criminal
organizations. Whether this would be preferred to a strategy that
reduced the concentration in the industry, but enhanced its
performance and shifted its conduct to more random patterns of
violence depends on how the society values these competing
objectives, and how much improved performance and violence it
would have to accept as the price of reduced concentration. That
would be a difficult choice. </p>

<p>The Definition of Improvements. At any rate, the directions in
which improvement lie, are clear, and so are the objectives of a
supply reduction strategy. The first and most important objective
is to frustrate the performance of the illicit industry - to
constrict its capacity to supply drugs to illicit markets. The
second is to shape the conduct of the residual industry so that
it is less violent and less corrupting. The third is to disperse
the industry so that the firms that comprise it are small and
transient rather than large and durable. How are one can go in
achieving these objectives, and how sharp the trade-offs among
them can only be answered by a close look at the factors that
shape the structure, conduct and performance of the industry. </p>

<p>Major Factors Shaping the Industry </p>

<p>As in any industry performance is determined at least partly
by engineering or mechanical factors: e.g., the physical
requirements of production and distribution. To get drugs to
illegal markets, firms must have access to raw materials, have
the knowledge and the equipment required to transform the raw
materials into finished products, be able to maintain and protect
inventories, and be able to transport finished products to
individual markets. </p>

<p>In addition, the performance of the industry will be shaped by
economic factors: i.e., the perceptions of opportunities and
risks. Those who make investments of the time and energy in
producing or diverting raw materials, in learning the techniques
and acquiring the equipment for producing illegal drugs, in
storing and transporting the drugs, and so on, must have some
assurance that they will make money from their investments. They
must have some capital to give them the time and the capacity to
arrange the deals that will ultimately produce satisfactory
returns. They must also have a certain tolerance for risk - not
only the risk that they might be imprisoned for their activities,
but also that they might take economic losses as a result of
successful enforcement actions against them, betrayals by their
associates, or more common economic disasters, such as
shipwrecks, plane crashes, spoiled production runs, or sudden
changes in exchange rates. Unless there is a reasonable chance in
their minds that they can make enough money from illicit drug
deals to compensate them for their time and their risks, the
deals will not be made. </p>

<p>A third factor influencing performance is the structure of
criminal liability that surrounds the industry, for it is the
laws and the way that they are enforced that determines many of
the opportunities and risks facing illicit drug dealers. A simple
way to think about how this factor operates is to think of the
criminal laws and the specific methods of enforcement as a kind
of tax confronting the illegal dealers. To maximize their return,
they seek to avoid as much of the tax as possible. They do this
by avoiding activities that are heavily taxed, by taking
advantage of loopholes in the tax laws or weakness in
enforcement, by concealing as much of their operation from the
tax collectors as possible, or by corrupting the tax collectors.
Such activities affect both the scale and the character of the
illicit industry. </p>

<p>The Apparent Influence of Geography </p>

<p>Geography looks like a factor that plays an important role in
determining the conduct and performance of the illicit industry.
Indeed, much of our thinking about supply reduction strategies is
guided by the notion that there are important &quot;source
countries&quot; that become the targets of diplomatic and
enforcement initiatives. Thus, for many years, Turkey and France
were regarded as the principal sources of heroin, although they
have now been replaced by Mexico and Southeast Asia. Similarly,
Colombia is now considered the principal source of cocaine, and
Jamaica a primary source of marijuana. </p>

<p>The reason that geography seems important is that different
countries represent different clusters of conditions that give
them a comparative advantage as a supplier of drugs to illicit
markets in the United States. Sometimes a country becomes an
important source country because of agricultural conditions that
make it an especially attractive (perhaps even unique) place in
which to produce raw materials. Thus, for a while, we imagine
that opium poppies could be successfully grown in only a few
countries in the world, and we now hope this is true of coca
leaves. In short, a country may become an importance source of
supply due to a physical advantage. </p>

<p>Other times it seems that a country has become a major source
as the result of a long tradition of producing the relevant raw
materials, or a large domestic industry that is based on them. In
effect, the country has a unique institutional and economic
advantage because it has a large infrastructure already invested
in the cultivation of the opium, coca leaves, or marijuana. </p>

<p>Still other times, it seems that the country's advantage comes
from week laws governing the legitimate or illicit drug
industries, or weak governmental commitment and capacity for
controlling the illicit drug industry. Just as Las Vegas can
become the center of gambling simply by establishing a legal
regime that tolerates it, Jamaica may become a principal source
of marijuana by being particularly lax with respect to the
suppression of illicit cultivation. </p>

<p>Thus, while geography looks like it plays an important
independent role in determining the character of the illicit drug
markets, this apparent influence actually derives from the more
basic causes already noted: the physical relations governing
production and distribution, the economic/ institutional
relations that give economic actors reasonable assurances that
investments in particular activities will be rewarded, and the
legal regime that has an independent effect on the risks and
opportunities confronting illicit dealers. Thus, geography may
drop out of any close analysis of the factors shaping the
performance of the illicit supply system, and be replaced by a
separate consideration of how certain countries seem to represent
unusually favorably combinations of the underlying causal
factors, and which ones seem particularly important. </p>

<p>The Irrelevance of Physical Requirements </p>

<p>While it is tempting to search for the explanation of the
structure, conduct and performance of the illicit industry in the
physical mechanics of producing and distributing drugs, there is
very little in these relationships that is unusual, or that could
constrain or shape the performance of the industry. Many of the
raw materials necessary to produce narcotics and dangerous drugs
are widely available. This is true primarily because they have
many legitimate uses, but also simply because they can be grown
or artificially produced in many different locations. Of course,
and occasional local shortage in basic raw materials may sometime
appear. But, given the alternative sources of supply, it is hard
to imagine that the shortage would last. Indeed, it is hard to
imagine long run shortages in the availability of opium poppies,
marijuana, coca leaves, or even chemicals used to produced
synthetic opiates, hallucinogens, and other psychoactive drugs. </p>

<p>It is equally difficult to imagine that either the knowledge
or the equipment necessary for manufacturing illicit drugs could
be in long run short supply. The chemical structure of the
illicit drugs are well known. Indeed, they are so well known that
illicit labs are now experimenting with small manipulations of
the chemical structure of existing drugs to determine if the
newly created drugs will produce similar or superior psychoactive
effects. These so-called &quot;designer drugs&quot; challenge the
legal regime regulating drugs because they may be legal to
produce and distribute until enough experience has accumulated to
declare them a significant abuse threat. </p>

<p>The equipment required for the production of the drugs is also
commonplace. Indeed, heroin &quot;labs&quot; in Mexico often
consisted of little more than wash-tubs and rubber hoses. And the
drugs can be made in many different quantities with few
implications for the costs of production. So, there seems to be
little in the technology of production that would have a decisive
impact on the structure, conduct or performance of the industry. </p>

<p>The Impact of Illicitness on Industry Conduct </p>

<p>My strong conviction is that the dominant factor shaping the
illicit drug industry is the simple fact that it is illicit. This
fact has broad and significant implications for its structure,
conduct and performance. The immediate consequences of
illicitness register in the conduct of the illicit firms, but the
changes in conduct have important implications for structure and
performance. </p>

<p>The Risk of Arrest. The most obvious consequence of
illicitness is that those who produce, import, distribute or use
drugs illegally are exposed to the threat of arrest, prosecution
and imprisonment. Moreover, in some countries, they are
threatened by the seizure of any property or assets used in their
illegal drug dealing - a threat whose significance may dwarf not
only any fine they may receive, but also some jail terms. </p>

<p>The obvious effect of threatening illicit producers,
distributors and users with jail is that the dealers who remain
in the business will take steps to reduce their risks, or to
compensate themselves for the risks of being is the business. The
principal devices for reducing risks are to keep operations
secret so that enforcement agencies cannot discover them, or to
corrupt the agencies so that even if their operations are
discovered, they are not punished. The principal devices used to
keep their operations secret are to deal with a small number of
people, to conceal the traces of their activities, and to screen
and discipline their employees, associates and customers to make
sure they are not undercover agents, and do not become police
informants. The principal ways of corrupting enforcement agencies
are to offer money to be allowed to continue to operate, and to
inform on their competitors and associates so that the police can
make arrests without harming their operations. </p>

<p>Such efforts can only be partially effective in eliminating
the risk of punishment. To deal in large quantities of drugs and
make money from the enterprise, one must inevitably deal with a
large number of people, only some of whom are trusted and
effectively disciplined. Thus, the risk of informants and
undercover agents among one's employees, associates or customers
is always present. Similarly, drug dealing always involves
leaving traces of one's activities that cannot be entirely
concealed: physical inventories of raw materials or drugs,
records of financial transactions, even records of phone calls
among the conspirators. These, too, are vulnerable to discovery
by enforcement agencies. Also, there are so many agencies and
agents involved in drug enforcement activities that one can never
be sure whether all those who pose a threat have been corrupted.
Since the risk can never be quite eliminated, the dealer's
response is to demand additional compensation for the risks in
trafficking drugs. He demands higher prices for drugs than he
would if there was no risk of going to jail. </p>

<p>The Risk of Rip-Offs. A less obvious but by no means less
important consequences of the illicit status of drug production,
importation and distribution is that illegal dealers are
confronted by threats from other criminals as well as by
enforcement agencies. Indeed, associates, competitors and
ordinary armed robbers probably create greater risks for illicit
drug dealers than enforcement agencies. Partly this is because
dealers are very tempting targets. They are likely to have large
amounts of cash, or large quantities of drugs that can be
converted to cash. Also, they are unlikely to turn to enforcement
agencies to help protect their operations. They have to supply
protection against armed attack or stealing. Those in the
criminal milieu may know more than enforcement agencies about who
is &quot;holding&quot; or currently doing business, and these
other criminals may be less constrained by the niceties of due
process than the enforcement agencies. Thus, other criminals may
be more strongly motivated and better positioned to attack
illegal drug dealers than the enforcement agencies, and therefore
pose a graver threat to the illicit dealers. </p>

<p>The implications of this fact are that the dealers must make
special provisions to protect themselves from this threat. To a
degree, the same methods of secrecy and discipline may be as
helpful against other crooks as against the police. But it seems
likely that the threat from other crooks is more apt to be met by
capacities for violence. In general, if an armed confrontation
between the dealers and enforcement agencies occurs, the dealers
know they will lose. They may win a local fire-fight, but there
is no way they can compete over the long run with enforcement
agencies in violent confrontations. Consequently, they rely most
heavily on secrecy and corruption to deal with the threat of
enforcement. </p>

<p>With other criminals, however, the balance of armed power is
less clear. Thus, it is tempting to build capacities for violence
to protect oneself and one's business from &quot;take-off&quot;
artists, and to establish credible threats effective against
betrayals by associates. This capacity for violence can also be
used externally to drive out competitors. But the vulnerability
to other criminals associated with illicitness provides the most
immediate and compelling justification for developing a capacity
for violence, as well as for secrecy and corruption. The
existence of these capacities for violence among dealers and
those who would steal from them produces the bulk of the violence
within the illegal drug industry. </p>

<p>Thus, the conduct of the firms within the illicit industry is
profoundly influenced by the fact of their illicitness. They are
forced to maintain secrecy, and to prevent the infiltration of
police agents. They must develop capacities to bribe, suborn, or
mislead government agents. Also they must develop capacities for
violence to enforce contracts with associates, protect their
property from armed robbers, and to discipline employees.
Finally, because the risks of arrest or rip-offs cannot ever
wholly be eliminated, they must price their products not only to
cover costs, but also to compensate themselves for the risk of
arrest or financial loss they are taking by engaging in such a
risky business. These effects on the conduct of firms have
implications for structure and performance. </p>

<p>The Impact of Illicitness on Structure </p>

<p>The consequences of illicit status for the structure of the
illicit industry are hard to estimate, for they will be
determined by a balance of conflicting influences. On one hand,
the desire to prevent the police and other criminals from
learning about their operation will motivate illicit
entrepreneurs to keep their small firms, transient, and neither
vertically nor horizontally integrated. </p>

<p>The Virtues of Small Firms and Decentralization. Smallness has
the virtues of involving only a small number of people and a
small number of transactions. This implies both that the
intrinsic vulnerability of the operations is less, and that the
contributions of any special efforts to discipline or secure the
operation will go further because there are fewer associates,
employees or transactions over which to spread these efforts. </p>

<p>Transience has similar advantages to smallness. If the
problems for illicit dealers is to avoid others knowing they are
in business, they can accomplish this by getting into the
business and out of it before anyone knows who they are. Indeed,
from the perspective of avoiding detection, the best operation is
one that is both small and transient. But that firm is not worth
disrupting, also, for it could never amount to much in terms of
its ability to supply drugs, its contribution to violence and
corruption, or to become a powerful institution to the community.
</p>

<p>Vertical and horizontal disintegration also have important
advantages in avoiding detection. A vertically integrated firm
would require some system of information-gathering and
record-keeping to exploit the advantages of explicit coordination
across the different phases of the operation. But these records
would become an important source of evidence against the dealers.
Similarly, almost by definition, vertically integrated firm would
be large and involve many transactions, and each element of the
firm would know what other elements were doing. Thus, a
vertically integrated firm would present more possible points of
penetration and would be much more vulnerable to any given
penetration, than a firm organized as a set of largely separate
cells that operated relatively autonomously. </p>

<p>Similarly, a horizontally integrated firm would also have to
be large and would have to be in contact with all firms engaged
in the activities at other stages of the production process.
Thus, a horizontally integrated firm in the business of
off-loading mother ships would come to know the principal
importing firms that arranged for the mother ships to appear off
the coast, and the principal firms engaged in storage and
distribution. This would make such a firm vulnerable to betrayal
by the others, compared with a firm that handled less of the
overall off-loading business. </p>

<p>Thus, to escape detection, firms in the illicit drug industry
would choose to be small, transient and disintegrated. This, in
turn, would lead to a highly fragmented - even atomistic -
structure in the industry. </p>

<p>The Virtues of Scale and Concentration. On the other hand, it
is possible there are some economies of scale in the production
and distribution of illicit drugs, or some opportunities for
controlling competition that would lead to relatively large,
durable firms, and a relatively high degree of concentration in
the industry. Ironically, the principal potential for economies
of scale do not seem to lie in the areas of production or
marketing. Instead they lie in the development of capacities for
corruption and violence that will give some firms special
opportunities to operate safely and efficiently in the dangerous
illicit markets. </p>

<p>The capacity for disciplined, irresistible violence may be a
particularly important factor of production in illicit supply
systems, and may be an area where there are natural economies of
scale. As we have seen, a capacity for violence is terribly
important in disciplining employees to keep then from becoming
informants. It is also important in being able to enforce
contracts with business associates and in protecting life and
property from other criminals in a world where one cannot rely on
the ordinary courts and police to perform this function.
Moreover, once developed for these purposes, the capacity for
violence can become important in eliminating competition, or
forcing it to be small and transient rather than large and
durable. For all these reasons, a firm had a substantial capacity
for violence would have an obvious competitive advantage in
supply drugs to illicit markets. </p>

<p>To argue that violent firms would have a competitive advantage
is not quite the same as saying that the obvious value of a
capacity for violence will tend to produce large, durable firms,
and a concentrated structure in the industry. That argument rests
on an additional assertion that there are economies of scale in
the development of this special capacity for violence. This
assertion, in turn, rests on the ideal that a useful capacity for
violence consists not in the production of actual violence, but
instead in a reputation for irresistible violence that can
overwhelm (in force, viciousness, sustainability or all three)
any degree of violence that another illegal entrepreneur can
imagine mounting. This is important, for it is quite obvious that
real violence can be produced quite easily and inexpensively.
What is valuable violence, however, is violence that need not be
used but will still intimidate and discourage others because it
is there to be used and cannot be successfully resisted. To have
this capacity, a firm must have available not only a large
quantity of violence and demonstrate its willingness to use it,
but also be a sufficiently permanent and relentless institution
so that the possibility of an opponent challenging it and
escaping without retaliation seems remote. </p>

<p>This capacity seems to have some natural monopolistic
features. One can easily imagine how a single organization could
gradually corner the market for irresistible violence and create
a fairly impregnable local monopoly. One can less easily but
still plausibly imagine a small number of firms with such
capabilities co-existing in an uneasy truce, and ignoring a
certain number of violations of their tacit understandings, as
well as a small amount of minor competition from transient
outsiders. What is hard to imagine as a stable equilibrium is a
world in which there are large numbers of closely matched firms
vying for the position of a recognized dominant capacity for
violence. In that world the factor of production that has value -
namely, a dominating capacity for violence that is sufficient to
discipline employees, enforce contracts, and protect reliably
against take-offs - is not available to any firm. Each firm is
therefore vulnerable to all threats that a solid reputation for
irresistible violence would guard against. </p>

<p>If the reputation for irresistible violence is valuable, it
takes substantial investment to build the capabilities, and if it
only has value when it is greater than any other competing
firm's, the importance of this factor of production will tend to
produce high degrees of concentration in the industry. This will
lead to the development of a few large, durable firms in any
local market. This is true at least in part because this
reputation for violence can substitute for a small scale in
preventing the detection of the operation. If employees,
associates, competitors and customers are all afraid to give
information about the operations of a firm to the police or other
criminals, then it can operate at any given scale with less risk
than another firm that is similar in all respects other than its
capacity and reputation for violence. </p>

<p>The capacity for corrupting government officials may also be
an important factor of production and distribution. This might
also be an important factor of production and distribution that
might also tend to create larger more durable firms and higher
degrees of concentration than one might hypothesize, if one were
thinking only of how the illicit firms might escape detection.
The easiest way to think about the problem of corruption is to
imagine that the various government officials and agencies,
responsible for enforcing laws against illegal production and
distribution, have a de facto power to grant a license to illegal
entrepreneurs to operate legally - or at least with no treat from
them. Obviously, the value of this license to the illicit dealers
depends on the extent to which a given official or agency
monopolizes the legal threat to them. If a given official or
agency is the only official threat against an illicit dealer, the
value of his protection will obviously be higher than if the
official threat against an illicit dealer, the value of his
protection will obviously be higher than if the official or agent
is only one of many potential threats against the dealer. </p>

<p>Thus, the question of whether corruption will tend to
concentrate in the industry depends crucially on the organization
of the enforcement agencies. If the enforcement agencies were
organized in a single agency, and if the hierarchical control
within the agencies was very powerful, and if the illicit firm
could corrupt that agency, it would be able to gain and hold a
monopoly in the area principally by using the enforcement agency
to help it eliminate competition, while keeping it safe. If, on
the other hand, the enforcement agencies had fragmented
jurisdictions, and quite imperfect control over their agents,
then they might be more vulnerable to some degree of corruption,
but the significance of the corruption would be much less.
Essentially, the enforcement agency could not sell an exclusive
right to operate safely. It could only sell little pieces of
insurance against threats from specific agents or agencies. Even
this would produce some higher degree of concentration in the
industry than if corruption were not part of the operating
strategies of the illicit firms, since it would establish some
barriers to entry and protect the position of some firms. But it
would by no means guarantee a monopoly. </p>

<p>The Net Result of Conflicting Pressures. Therefore, there are
pressures that push the drug industry towards small firms and an
atomistic structure, and others that are consistent with the
development of local monopolies and relatively concentrated
structures. My strong hunch is that the net result of this will
be to produce an illicit industry that includes a heterogeneous
distribution of firms. There will be a few firms that are in
strong position to exploit the economies of scale that come from
a reputation for trustworthiness, and for irresistible violence
in the case of betrayal. Such firms may come to account for a
relatively large fraction of the drugs reaching illicit markets,
but they will be a small fraction of the total number of firms
operating. This will be true partly because it is unlikely that
these firms will become either horizontally or vertically
integrated. The risks of long chains of command in the case of
vertical integration, or a wide network of contacts in the case
of horizontal integration are apt to be much greater than the
potential benefits. It is also true because these firms will not
be able to prevent (and will not find it worth preventing)
occasional competition from transient or small operations which
have their own sources of supply, and their own local markets.
Therefore, there will be a great many firms of different sizes in
the industry. </p>

<p>If one were thinking about analogies from legitimate
industries, my hunch is that the best analogy might be something
like the real estate industry, rather than the auto industry or
even the fast-food industry. Many developers put together large,
uncertain deals, rather than producing or distribution a product.
Moreover, the deals are likely to involve several different
partners, and the partnerships and roles may change from deal to
deal. Those in the industry who have a reputation for
trustworthiness, &quot;deep-pockets,&quot; strong political
connections, and effective lawyers are likely to account for a
large fraction of the total dollar value of the deals made. But
there will be a great many others in the industry who do smaller
deals. </p>

<p>The Impact of Illicitness on Performance </p>

<p>Because illicitness affects conduct and structure, it also has
an enormously importantly impact on industry performance. The
crucial result is that drug prices are much higher than they
otherwise would be. This is partly because the defensive
strategies mounted by dealers against enforcement agencies and
other criminals translate into higher operating costs per unit of
drug delivered, and partly because dealers demand additional
compensation for their risks. This is shown by the fact that the
price of drugs in illicit markets is higher than the price of
equivalent drugs in legal markets by factors of 20 or 30. </p>

<p>Almost as important is that the drugs are less conveniently
available than they otherwise would be. Dealers have an incentive
to conceal their activities rather than advertise then. Growth in
the market tends to happen within intimate networks of friends,
rather than through public advertising and widespread
availability. In all likelihood, these are slower and less
effective methods of market development than the same mechanisms
joined with a legitimate distribution system. </p>

<p>We can combine the effect on price and the effect on
availability in a single concept called the &quot;effective
price&quot; of drugs in illicit markets. That would include not
only the monetary cost, but also the amount of time a customer
would have to spend looking for the drug, and the chance that he
might fail to find the drug, or be cheated by an unscrupulous
dealer. In these terms, illicitness results in much higher
effective prices for illicit drugs than if they were legal. Note
that this is probably true even if publicly supported enforcement
activities were relatively ineffective. For, even if the threat
from the enforcement agencies were removed, the threat from other
criminals would remain, and that by itself would be enough by
itself to increase dramatically the effective prices of illicit
drugs. So illicitness has a profound impact on the performance of
the industry. </p>

<p>The fact that the price of drugs is increased by the illicit
status of the industry is evaluated in different ways from
different vantage points. Viewed from the perspective of drug
abuse policy, this is desireable because it will reduce overall
levels of drug use in the population by discouraging new users
from continuing their drug use, and motivating older users to
seek treatment and abandon their use. Viewed from the perspective
of organized crime policy, the increased prices mean a larger
flow of revenues to illicit dealers and criminal organizations.
This is damaging to the objectives of organized crime policy, for
it creates the impression that crime pays, and provides the
necessary financial means to enlarge illegal operations, or to
consolidate a position vis-a-vis other criminal organizations or
the enforcement agencies. Regardless of whether the economic
proceeds are used by illegal dealers for consumption or
investment, the higher revenues become a problem for organized
crime policy. </p>

<p>It is also possible that over the long run, the higher
revenues become a problem for drug abuse policy. This would be
true, for example, if the conspicuous consumption of wealthy drug
dealers attracted more people into the industry, or if the
investments made by more disciplined dealers allowed them not
only to dominate the supply system, but to increase its overall
capacity to supply drugs. In each case, the revenues from the
industry would be operating to increase the overall supply
capacity of the system, just as excess profits in a legitimate
industry would attract new investment into that industry. </p>

<p>It is important to keep in mind, however, that the reasons
that prices are high in the drug industry is precisely because
dealers are confronted by risks of violence and financial loss
from both the government and other criminals. This fact remains
true and continues to discourage many from entering the business.
Indeed, the greater the risks, the greater the profits must be to
attract any one into the business. That is the explicit purpose
of making the drug business illegal and attacking it
aggressively. As long as that threat remains substantial, the
overall supply capacity of the industry will be much smaller than
otherwise, even though people in the industry are making money.
People do not flock to the industry, even with high prices and
high revenues, because the risks are also high.<br>

<h2>Consultant Paper: Part 2: The Impact of the Legitimate Drug
System </h2>

<p>The last important factor shaping the structure, conduct and
performance of the illicit drug industry is the character of the
legitimate drug system that operates alongside it. The
significance of the legitimate drug system is most obvious for
drugs such as methadone, amphetamines and barbiturates, which
have important medical uses, and very large legitimate production
and distribution systems. Even those drugs that do not have
legitimate medical uses often have some contact with a legitimate
market system. Some illicit heroin, for example, comes from
legitimate opium crops grown to produce morphine. Hallucinogens
and methamphetamine are often manufactured from chemical
precursors that have significant legitimate uses. And even
marijuana has a legitimate sector composed of researchers who are
experimenting with its pharmacological characteristics and
potential medical applications for the control of glaucoma and
depression. </p>

<p>The existence of a legitimate sector in which raw materials,
precursors, or finished goods are produced, stored, distributed
and consumed has a potentially significant impact on the
character of the illicit industry. The reason is that diversion
from the legitimate market becomes an alternative to wholly
illicit production and distribution as a source of supply to
illicit markets. Exactly what influence will be exerted depends
on the size of the legitimate market, the strength of the
regulatory regime that surrounds it, and whether the legitimate
system includes the production and distribution of finished goods
or stops some place short of this goal. </p>

<p>For drugs which have a large, loosely regulated legitimate
supply system that includes the distribution of finished goods,
diversion from legitimate sources is likely to become the
dominant source of supply to illicit users. For drugs that have
only a small legitimate sector that is limited to raw materials
or precursors, the illicit supply will be dominated by wholly
illicit production and distribution. Thus, the illicit demand for
tranquilizers is likely to be supplied principally by diversion.
The illicit demand for hallucinogens and marijuana will be
principally supplied by wholly illicit production and
distribution. Also, the illicit demand for amphetamines and
opiate analgesics, such as heroin, morphine and methadone, will
be supplied partly by diverted legitimate drugs, and partly by
wholly illicit production and distribution. </p>

<p>The existence of a legitimate sector from which drugs may be
diverted to illegal use will generally improve the performance of
the illicit market in that drugs will be cheaper and more readily
available than they would be if no legitimate sector existed.
This is true simply because some portion of the activities
necessary to produce and distribute the drug will not be hampered
by the difficulties created by illicitness. Raw materials can be
acquired, transformed into finished products, stored, and
distributed with fewer worries about theft and betrayal by
associates, or disruption by enforcement officials. True,
operating costs will be increased by the requirements of the
regulatory regime. And true, also, someone must absorb the costs
and risks of diverting the drugs to illicit markets. But in all
likelihood, these costs will be much smaller than the costs
imposed on the firms, if they had to assume all of the burden of
protecting their property and enforcing contracts as they have to
in wholly illicit industry. To the extent that only a portion of
the supply system must pay these costs, operating costs and
therefore prices should be lower in illicit markets. </p>

<p>The existence of the legitimate industry should also make the
illicit markets much more flexible. If an illicit amphetamine
laboratory finds that it cannot obtain precursors from the
legitimate market, it can always go into the business of stealing
them from the legitimate sector. Once it has the capacity to
steal precursors, the illicit firm might find it easier to steal
finished products. In short, the existence of the legitimate
market allows illicit dealers the options of relying on theft or
fraud with or without the collusion of people within the
legitimate industry to meet market demands - options that would
not be available if there were no legitimate market. </p>

<p>The impact of the legitimate market on the structure of the
illicit industry is also quite important. The crucial variables
are the places where leaks occur in the process of production and
distribution and the size and regularity of leaked quantities. </p>

<p>Obviously, if only raw materials and precursors leak from the
legitimate system, the illicit system will have to develop
illicit production capabilities to transform the raw materials
into finished goods. This will exert a slight centralizing trend,
for the knowledge and the equipment necessary to produce the
drugs constitute a form of capital that must be amortized and
that means those who possess these will stay in business long
enough and produce enough drugs to achieve this goal. The
break-even point may not require a very large or very durable
firm. The point is that the diversion of raw materials will be
associated with larger more durable firms than the diversion of
finished goods. </p>

<p>When finished goods are stolen, the firm may have no capital
to amortize, and may stay in business only long enough to dispose
of an existing quantity. Of course, a large theft, such as a
truck hijacking, can make a firm look like a major trafficker. If
the firm arranges to continue hijacking drug shipments, it may
become a major drug dealer with an unusual source of supply. In
the more likely case, however, a large theft of legitimate drugs
will produce a large, but transient firm. It will go out of
business shortly. </p>

<p>The other possibilities are that small quantities of finished
goods are diverted either continuously or irregularly from the
legitimate supply system. This form of diversion will produce
small firms that are either durable or transient depending on how
frequently they go back to the well. </p>

<p>Thus, the supply of drugs that have legitimate uses to illicit
markets will be decisively influenced by the size and character
of the leaks from the legitimate system. The earlier in the
process of production and distribution the leaks occur, the
larger and more continuous they are, the more the illicit supply
system will be composed of large durable firms. The later in the
process of distribution, and the smaller and more erratic the
leaks, the more the industry will be atomized. Thus, one might
expect the illicit market in tranquilizers and methadone to be
composed primarily of small, transient firms fueled by small
scale thefts. The illicit markets in amphetamines and
hallucinogens are likely to somewhat more concentrated with more
of the illicit supply in the hands of larger, more of the illicit
supply in the hands of larger, more durable firms. </p>

<p>Different Drugs, Different Industries </p>

<p>So far, our analysis of the illicit drug industry has
abstracted from the particular features of the principal drugs of
abuse in the United States. We have treated heroin, cocaine,
marijuana, hallucinogens, amphetamines, barbiturates and
tranquilizers in a similar analytic framework. But to analyze the
supply systems for these drugs from the same analytic perspective
is not the same as assuming that the supply systems will be
similar. It is only to assume that they will be pushed in similar
directions by the factors we have considered. Exactly how far
they will be pushed in one direction or another strongly depends
on all the factors we have considered, including how zealously
the illegal supply systems are controlled by regulatory and
criminal enforcement. </p>

<p>Heroin </p>

<p>Heroin, for example, seems to be primarily a problem of wholly
illicit production and distribution. The fields in which the
opium poppies are grown are generally illicit fields in countries
that cannot adequately enforce existing laws prohibiting the
cultivation of opium. Similarly, the processing of the raw opium
into heroin occurs principally in foreign countries - probably to
reduce the bulk of the material to facilitate international
smuggling. Because the volume of heroin is so small, it comes
into the United States through many different devices - in the
carry-on luggage of pilots, hidden in small cans of tomatoes and
olive oil, concealed in secret compartments built into cars, and
so on. In the United States the distribution systems seem
moderately tightly concentrated with significant local
monopolies, but little vertical integration. There is probably
some degree of horizontal integration at the importing stage, and
it is at this stage that the concentration of the distribution
system is probably the greatest. Perhaps the few largest firms in
any given city control more than two-thirds of the total volume
of heroin in the city, with some cities in the U.S. serving as
transshipment points for other cities. This relatively tight and
concentrated structure is the result of the fact that the
enforcement pressures are probably still the heaviest against
heroin dealers. </p>

<p>Cocaine </p>

<p>The cocaine supply system seems quite similar to the one for
heroin. It is principally a problem of wholly illicit production
and distribution. The sources of raw materials and finished
products are primarily foreign. The physical volumes to be
handled are small enough to make concealment of the drugs a
relatively trivial matter and to allow smugglers to use a variety
of different methods for bringing the drugs into the country. The
average size of the deals measured in terms of financial
requirements seem to be approximately the same as those that
occur in the heroin market. </p>

<p>The major difference between the heroin and the cocaine supply
systems seems to be that the cocaine system is less concentrated,
and more violent than the heroin market. There seem to be many
more entrepreneurs who enter the cocaine business on a short term
basis. Moreover, none of the groups operating on a more permanent
basis seems to have established predominance in the industry.
Thus, it is not surprising that this market is more violent than
the heroin market, for there are cash, drugs and market position
up for grabs in a way unlike the heroin market. </p>

<p>Marijuana </p>

<p>Marijuana is similar to heroin and cocaine in that it is a
wholly illicit system with predominantly foreign sources of raw
materials. Three principal differences seem to make the marijuana
supply system quite different, however. One crucial difference is
that the bulk of marijuana per dollar of value is so much greater
than that of heroin and cocaine that the smuggling problem is
enormously exacerbated. A hundred thousand dollars of heroin or
cocaine can easily be held in a suitcase, but to carry a hundred
thousand dollars worth of marijuana, one needs a small truck,
boat or plane. Because marijuana is so much more visible than
heroin or cocaine, the primary mode of smuggling is in large
loads landed between ports of entry rather than infiltrated
through ports of entry in the huge volume of cargo and people
that daily cross the U.S. borders. This also implies that many
specialized firms might grow up to cope with the special problems
of smuggling marijuana. </p>

<p>A second difference between heroin and cocaine on the one hand
and marijuana on the other is that the pressures in the illicit
industry seem less. It is not that marijuana dealers do not face
substantial financial risks. Indeed, it seems that quite the
opposite is true. The best current estimates indicate that
marijuana dealers lose from a quarter to a third of their
shipments to enforcement agencies. Instead it seems that the
losses are primarily financial, and primarily inflicted by the
government. Other criminals do not seem to prey on marijuana
traffickers in the same way that they attack heroin and cocaine
dealers. Moreover, even if the government seizes property and
arrests the dealers, the prison terms meted out to marijuana
traffickers seem less severe than for those who traffick in other
drugs. Since the marijuana dealers face smaller and less drastic
threats from both the government and other criminals, the
marijuana market seems less preoccupied by the problems of
secrecy, discipline and security than the heroin and cocaine
markets. The net result of this is an industry that is probably
less concentrated then either the heroin and cocaine market, and
almost certainly less violent. </p>

<p>The third important difference shaping the marijuana industry
is the existence of small scale domestic production and
distribution as well as foreign. Indeed, the potential for small
scale domestic cultivation of marijuana makes the marijuana
market more like the market for barbiturates and tranquilizers
than for heroin, because some portion of the overall illicit
demand will be met by those who grow their own. It is this fact
that guarantees the overall industry cannot become very
concentrated, just as it is the widespread availability of
barbiturates and tranquilizers through small scale diversion from
legitimate sources that prevents a concentrated illicit industry
in these drugs from developing. </p>

<p>Hallucinogens, Barbiturates and Amphetamines </p>

<p>The supply system for hallucinogens seems to be primarily
domestic illicit production, although it is possible that some
drugs come from Mexico or Canada. There is a degree of
concentration in this industry as a result of specialized
knowledge, and the creation of brand names to which consumers
become loyal. It seems to operate with relatively little reliance
on either violence or bribery, probably because the industry is
sufficiently small to not be worth the time of enforcement
officials or other criminals. </p>

<p>The industry that supplies barbiturates to illicit markets
seems to depend primarily on diversion from the legitimate
market. Thus, its structure mirrors the character of the leaks
from the legitimate system. This seems to produce a highly
atomistic market composed of small or transient firms. Again,
there is little reliance on either violence or corruption because
the economic stakes seem too small to warrant such risky conduct.
</p>

<p>The amphetamine industry seems to be a combination of the
supply system for hallucinogens and barbiturates. There seems to
be small scale illicit production and distribution that is
primarily domestic, but also from our near neighbors. There is
also diversion from the large legitimate supply system. The net
result is an industry that is high in performing, relative
atomistic in structure, and relies little on either violence or
corruption. </p>

<p>Designing a Strategy to Attack the Illegal Drug Industry </p>

<p>From the perspective of drug abuse policy the primary
objective of a strategy to attack the illegal drug industry is to
increase the effective prices of drugs in illicit markets. Given
our analysis of the factors shaping the structure, conduct and
performance of the industry, it is reasonable to suppose that
making the production and distribution of drugs illegal will tend
to make drugs more expensive and less available than they would
be if they were legal. The important policy question is how the
resources of the government - its diplomatic initiatives, its
interdiction efforts, and its criminal investigations - might be
deployed to maximize the impact of supply reduction efforts on
the effective prices of illicit drugs. </p>

<p>Priorities in Attacking the Illegal Drug Industries </p>

<p>One way to establish priorities is to determine which
particular drugs seem to be causing the greatest social problems,
and which present opportunities that would give supply reduction
efforts relatively powerful leverage. The worse the drug, and the
more powerful the leverage that can be exerted, the higher the
priority. </p>

<p>Of course, the question of which drugs pose the greatest
threat to the society is much debated. One way to resolve the
issue is to gauge the number of chronic users of each drug, and
to weight that number by the seriousness of the health, economic
and social problems that the chronic users of each drug suffer.
By this reckoning, heroin, amphetamines and barbiturates tend to
come out on top as the worst drugs. </p>

<p>A second standard would be to consider which drugs are most
widely used, and therefore operate as the principal transmitter
of an illicit drug culture and the most common introduction to
drug use for young children. By this standard, marijuana and
tranquilizers would probably come out on top. </p>

<p>A third standard would be to determine which drugs seem to be
associated with the most money, violence and corruption, and
attack that drug as the principal threat to the society. This
last standard would probably make cocaine and heroin the dominant
targets of drug policy. </p>

<p>In thinking about which of these standards night be
appropriate to use in deciding which drugs caused the greatest
social problems, it is worth trying to keep the separate
objectives of drug abuse policy and organized crime policy in
mind. The principal objective of drug use abuse policy is to
minimize the social problems associated with drug use. A key
instrument of that policy are criminal laws controlling the
supply of drugs. These policies succeed when there are few people
using drugs in patterns that create grave threats to their health
and economic welfare. In effect, we use criminal laws and
criminal enforcement to achieve a social welfare objective. </p>

<p>The principal objectives of organized crime policy are to
suppress the provision of illegal goods and services that
constitute the core of organized crime, to prevent the violence
and corruption that is more characteristic of organized crime
groups than other kinds of criminal activity, and to prevent the
emergence of very large, durable organizations with well
developed capacities for violence and corruption. </p>

<p>There is a substantial overlap in the goals of organized crime
policy and supply reduction efforts insofar as organized crime
policy takes the control of the supply of drugs as an important
objective, and insofar as the illicit supply systems included
violence, corruption and large firms. But to the extent that the
core of organized crime policy is really concerned with the
disruption of major criminal organizations, there is an overlap
between the core of drug abuse policy and organized crime policy
only insofar as the drugs are supplied by rich, violent and
powerful criminal organizations. As we have seen, that is true of
only a certain number of drugs, and not necessarily the drugs
that pose the greatest threats in terms of widespread and
dangerous consumption. </p>

<p>In fact, the third standard described above is closer to a
description of the core objectives of organized crime policy than
to the core objectives of drug abuse policy. In essence, the
society has to decide whether it means to go after the drugs that
cause it the most problem in illicit use, or whether it should
attack the drugs that are supplied by the nastiest and toughest
dealers. These are not necessarily the same. </p>

<p>The Instruments of a Strategy Against Illicit Drug Industries </p>

<p>Once the society has implicitly or explicitly established its
objectives, it must then look to the available instruments of a
supply reduction strategy. Again, there are many different ways
one can think about the available instruments. </p>

<p>Attacking Different Drugs. One way is to think about them in
terms of the particular drugs they attack. Thus, one can
distinguish the instruments of heroin policy (which include the
effective control of legitimate opium in Turkey, the suppression
of illicit crops in Mexico and Afghanistan, the encouragement of
crop substitution in Thailand, the creation of specialized heroin
detecting devices at U.S. ports of entry, and the targeting of
heroin importing and distributing organizations, and even the
occasional attacks on street level dealing in notorious areas of
a city) from the instruments of a marijuana control policy (which
includes diplomatic initiatives and foreign aid to Mexico and
Jamaica, the eradication of illicit fields, the training of
marijuana sniffing dogs to stand guard at the border, the
mobilization of the Navy and Coast Guard to aid in the
identification of ships engaged in large scale smuggling, and so
on). The point is that many policy initiatives are specific to,
or have their maximum impact on, one drug rather than another,
and it is a useful exercise to see how our efforts are deployed
against particular drugs. </p>

<p>Operating in Different Locations. A second dimension in which
strategies against the illegal drug industry can be described and
evaluated is geography. One can talk about the division between
the international drug control effort and the domestic
activities. Among the international efforts, one can talk about
policy towards Southeast Asia (which would be principally
directed at heroin), or towards Colombia (which would be
principally directed against cocaine), or towards Mexico (which
would embrace heroin, marijuana and amphetamines). Within the
domain of domestic supply reduction efforts, one can discuss the
allocation of enforcement efforts across major cities in the
United States, and this, too, has implications for the different
drugs attacked. Enforcement efforts in New York and Los Angeles
will probably give more emphasis to heroin and cocaine than
efforts in Kansas City or St. Louis. </p>

<p>Targeting Factors of Production. A third dimension in
characterizing and analyzing supply reduction policy instruments
is the factor of production and distribution that is the
principal target. Thus, one can distinguish eradication and crop
substitution programs, which are directed at raw materials; from
financial investigations, which attack the capital of illicit
dealers; from interdiction programs which attack goods in
transit, from conspiracy investigations, which are designed to
immobilize trafficking network; from street level enforcement
which is designed to discourage advertising and the development
of new markets. Of course, many instruments allow one to reach
other targets as well as its principal target. Indeed, conspiracy
investigations are often built from the discoveries made in
interdiction and street enforcement programs. The point is that
these different policy instruments have different factors of
production as their proximate targets. To the extent that some
factors of production and distribution are scarcer than others,
the relative importance of the different supply reduction
instruments in constricting the supply of drugs may be gauged and
appropriate adjustments made in the supply reduction strategy. </p>

<p>Relying on Different Agencies. A fourth way of thinking about
supply reduction policy instruments, and probably the most
common, is in terms of the agencies that are principally
responsible for carrying out different activities within the
overall supply reduction effort. Thus, one thinks in terms of the
international supply reduction program as the principal
responsibility of the State Department; the interdiction effort
as the primary responsibility of the U.S. Customs, Border Patrol,
and Coast Guard with occasional assistance from the U.S. Armed
Forces; the domestic investigation program as the primary
responsibility of DEA and the FBI; and the street level
enforcement effort as the primary responsibility of the nation's
thousands of local police departments. Thinking about the supply
reduction effort in these terms has the advantage of bringing
immediately to mind which agencies are available for supply
reduction efforts, and of suggesting approximately where they can
make a contribution both geographically and in terms of squeezing
particular factors of production and distribution. It has the
disadvantage, however, of not sharply distinguishing among the
different efforts in terms of either drugs or specific factors of
production and distribution. </p>

<p>The Strengths and Limitations of Alternative Instruments </p>

<p>For purposes of a broad brush strategic analysis, we will use
this last set of categories, since they are the terms in which
most of the policy discussions at the federal level are now being
carried out. Our task will be to determine the potential of each
area in minimizing the supply of drugs to illicit markets in the
U.S. That, in turn, depends on our ability to see how each of
these programs affects the factors of production and distribution
for the major drugs of abuse. </p>

<p>The International Program. The international drug control
program has two principal liabilities as an instrument of supply
reduction efforts. The first is that this program is inevitably
hostage to the interests and capabilities of foreign governments:
the U.S. can do no more in this area than other governments will
allow it to do. Of course, there are numerous ways in which the
U.S. government can increase the motivation and capacities of
foreign governments to control drugs that reach U.S. markets. The
U.S. can indicate the importance it attaches to drug control
among other interests it is pursuing within a given country; or
it can appeal to obligations a country has under international
treaties; or it can appeal to the country's self interest by
documenting the extent of the country's domestic drug problem. On
the capacity side, the U.S. can contribute money, or particular
kinds of equipment, or technical assistance in the forms of
specific on-site advice, or more generalized training of drug
control officials. These specific measures constitute the daily
activities of the international program. In the end, though, they
run up against more or less unmovable barriers, such as the
limited control of central governments over out-lying areas of a
country, or the inefficiency and corruption of government
agencies. Against these obstacles there is often little that the
U.S. government can do. </p>

<p>The second limitation is that the bulk of this program seems
too targeted on the raw materials for heroin, cocaine and
marijuana. Arguably, this is not particularly effective, since
there is not particular reason to believe that the raw materials
for these drugs are in long run short supply. Indeed, all our
experience and intelligence suggests that potential growing areas
for these drugs are widespread, and that the elimination of
fields in one place will fairly soon be replaced by cultivation
elsewhere. </p>

<p>These limitations are sufficiently severe that it would
probably be a mistake to rely on the international program as the
primary instrument in a supply reduction strategy. It simply
cannot do enough work reliably enough to merit that position.
Having said this, however, there are some very important things
the international program can do that will make an important
contribution to the overall effectiveness of supply reduction
efforts. </p>

<p>The first is that it will occasionally occur that the standard
efforts of the international program suddenly become effective.
This usually occurs when a country important in supplying drugs
to the United States suddenly becomes highly motivated to control
drugs. When this happens, support from the United States can
often result in a significant shortage of the drug. Typically,
the shortage lasts no longer than a year or two as the illicit
industry adjusts to the new conditions. But even so, that
shortage is worth producing. That is particularly true for drugs
that are unusually dependence producing, for the shortage means
that a cohort of children in the ages of maximum vulnerability
squirts through that period of relative shortages with much lower
probabilities of dependence or addiction. </p>

<p>Indeed, this is what happened in the early part of the 1970's,
when Turkey suddenly shut down its legitimate production of opium
and helped to produce a two to three year shortage in the supply
of heroin. The effect of this success was high effective prices
in the United States, reduced incidence of heroin use, and a
shift to Mexico and Southeast Asia as the principal sources of
supply, although for a while at lesser volumes than had been true
when Turkey was also a supplier. </p>

<p>Keeping open such opportunities, and being in a position to
exploit them when they come along, are the principal
contributions of the international drug program. Hut one cannot
always count on such successes. It is important, then, that the
international program continue, trying to increase the likelihood
that it can occasionally produce such successes, but no one
should rely on it as the principal supply reduction instrument. </p>

<p>A second way that the international program can be helpful is
by stepping up its efforts to support international criminal
enforcement. In essence, the focus of the international program
might usefully shift from crop eradication, to efforts to deny
international traffickers &quot;safe havens&quot; anywhere in the
world. This would mean concretely increased progress in
negotiating extradition treaties with countries that now harbor
traffickers, and improving operational coordination between
foreign and U.S. police agencies to take advantage of both
extradition and investigations and prosecutions within the host
country. </p>

<p>Such a thrust has potential for two reasons. First, it is a
narrowly focused program. It has none of the logistical and
bureaucratic difficulties of massive crop control programs.
Second, it is targeted against a factor of production and
distribution that is probably in long run short supply, namely
individuals with a sufficiently well established reputation for
both reliability in successful transactions and viciousness in
betrayals, who become the primary people with whom large drug
deals can be made. If this is the factor in long run short supply
in the illicit industry; and if the international program could
squeeze this factor even more by denying notorious dealers safe
havens anywhere in the world; then the international program
would have another more reliable and more powerful way of making
a contribution than cultivating the motivations and capacities of
foreign governments to control illicit crops. </p>

<p>Interdiction. In recent years, the interdiction program has
probably been the fastest growing component of the supply
reduction effort. The growth has come primarily as a result of
engaging the U.S. Coast Guard and other military agencies in the
pursuit of smugglers on the ocean and in the air. The results of
this effort can be seen in the dramatic difference in the price
of drugs landed in the U.S. as compared with the price of drugs
off-shore, or in foreign source countries. </p>

<p>The principal problem with interdiction as the dominant
instruction of supply reduction efforts is that it is principally
focused on a single drug - marijuana. That is particularly true
insofar as it concentrates on bulk shipments clandestinely landed
between ports of entry, for marijuana is the only drug whose
volume restricts smugglers to these methods of getting the drugs
across the borders. Smugglers of heroin and cocaine have many
more options, and much more of these drugs seem to come across in
relatively small containers through ports of entry. Thus, the
engagement of the Coast Guard, the Navy, the Air Force, and the
Federal Aviation Administration, turns out to be an initiative
that is primarily targeted against marijuana. To the extent that
one thinks marijuana is currently a high priority drug to
control, this may be counted a benefit rather than a problem. But
to the extent that one thinks other drugs are higher priority, or
to the extent one wanted flexible supply reduction instruments
that could be used for controlling several different drugs, the
current interdiction program has important limitations. </p>

<p>The interdiction program has a further limitation. It is
principally targeted on finished inventories of drugs. There is a
certain, concrete satisfaction in capturing drugs that would
otherwise reach illicit markets. But as in the case of crop
elimination, one can wonder whether the inventories are what is
in long run short supply. When we think about legitimate firms,
we don't think of their inventories of finished goods as being
particularly important. Obviously, the inventories have value,
and to the extent they are eliminated, the firm had less capital
than it otherwise would. But the inventories usually reflect only
a small portion of the total value of the firm. When Tylenol had
to be taken off the market, for example, no one expected the
company to go out of business, even though a month's worth of
production had to be written off, and their reputation had been
seriously tarnished. </p>

<p>Similarly, it is hard to understand why we think it is so
important when drugs are seized. This may be important if the
firm was a short term operation, and the seized shipment
represented a large fraction of its total assets, but there is no
particular reason to believe this. Most of the time it seems that
shipments are divided up precisely to hedge against the
possibility that he drugs will be seized, and this seems to be a
likely event. Current estimates indicate that somewhere between
one-quarter and one-third of all marijuana shipments are seized,
but this has had little impact on the effective price of
marijuana. Thus, our experience and our reasoning suggest that
finished goods are not a factor of production and distribution
that is in long run short supply. Consequently, a policy
instrument directed primarily against such inventories will not
exert enormous leverage on the long run effective price of drugs
in illicit markets. </p>

<p>Domestic Enforcement. The standard criticism of the domestic
enforcement program is that it is &quot;too far from the
source&quot; of drugs to allow effective control. By this
reckoning both the international and the interdiction programs
are preferred instruments because they attack the chain of
production and distribution at an earlier stage than domestic
enforcement. A second criticism is that the quantity of drugs
seized in the domestic enforcement program is too low to allow it
to have much effective control. A third criticism is that too
much of the effort within the domestic enforcement program goes
into low level cases, which are farthest from the source and
involve the smallest quantities of drugs. </p>

<p>The difficulty with these criticisms is that they rely on
assumptions - with little evidence or reasoning behind them -
about the best way to control the supply of drugs. In fact, they
emphasize physical over economic relationships. A priori there is
no particular reason to assume that resources are better spent
&quot;nearer the source.&quot; True, if one stops the drugs
earlier rather than later on need not worry about the later
stages; and, true, the drugs may be at their maximum
concentration with respect to volume at the point they are
processed into finished products. But neither point indicates
that he source is the most important point to attack. As we have
seen, it may be quite difficult to mount an attack at that point.
Moreover, both arguments place too much emphasis on the drugs and
not enough on the entrepreneurs and firms whose continued
determination and adaptability keep the drugs flowing, even if
production runs are spoiled and inventories seized. </p>

<p>If the principal difficulties that confront dealers in
producing and distributing drugs are risks posed by enforcement
agents and other criminals, then the crucial factors of
production and distribution are not raw materials and technology
and warehouses, but the determination and capacity to complete
transactions in this risky environment. Those may be qualities
possessed by specific individuals or trafficking networks - not
the raw materials, not the finished inventories, not even the
financial capital. If these observations are accurate, then any
instrument that attacked the capacities to complete risky trans
actions would be more effective than those that attacked raw
materials or inventories. </p>

<p>It is here that domestic enforcement operations have
advantages as an instrument in a supply reduction strategy. The
principal objective of domestic enforcement is the traffickers
themselves. The drugs are important only as convincing evidence
that will be sufficient to jail, and therefore presumably
immobilize, the traffickers. In addition, the tactics of domestic
enforcement operate principally on the capacity to execute
transactions. The principal tactics include informants,
undercover agents, and wiretap investigations. The first two
attack the ability to make transactions by forcing dealers to be
wary of associates, employees and customers, since any of these
might become an informant or an undercover agent. The third makes
it difficult for traffickers to communicate efficiently with
associates, employees and customers. Therefore domestic
enforcement presses hard on the factors of production and
distribution that seem in long run short supply. </p>

<p>It is worth noting that slowing transactions and forcing
dealers to be cautious has value at many different stages of
production and distribution. Even at the lowest levels of
distribution there are some advantages in forcing dealers to be
cautious, for it prevents the aggressive recruitment of new
customers and makes it more difficult even for regular consumers
to find drugs. In short, street level enforcement increases the
effective price of drugs in illicit markets. At intermediate or
high levels each transaction that is slowed reduces the overall
capacity of the system to supply drugs, and each trafficking
network that is eliminated results not only in loss of current
inventories, but also in future capacity to supply. </p>

<p>Moreover, it is possible that the same techniques of attacking
transactions, and immobilizing those networks that have developed
a continuing capacity to execute transactions in a risky
environment, would have enormous value in the international
program as well as in the domestic one. Indeed, while one cannot
assume that foreign countries have laws enforcement agencies that
allow them to attack criminal trafficking organizations, it seems
that it is primarily convention that makes us think of the
international program as focused on raw materials, and the
domestic program as focused on trafficking networks. In
principle, one could have a criminal enforcement program that
moved across national boundaries. And that might hold the best
chance not only for minimizing the supply of drugs to illicit
markets, but also for advancing the subjectives and using the
resources of organized crime policy. </p>

<p>An Alternative Approach to Attacking Illegal Drug Industries </p>

<p>If the right way to think about strategies against the illegal
drug industry is to guess which factor of production and
distribution is in long run short supply and then to devise a
strategy that presses hardest on that factor, and if the factor
in long run short supply is the capacity to make transactions
quickly and effectively, then a different way is opened to think
about the strategy against the illegal drug industry.
Specifically, the principal aim should be to frustrate
transactions and immobilize the largest trafficking
organizations. </p>

<p>With this as the principal aim the way that we think about
each of the other instruments changes. Of course, the
international efforts to control legitimate crops and eradicate
illicit fields retain their special, occasional importance, and
the separate arguments for maintaining pressure at the street
level remain strong. But we can also see that the international
program, interdiction, and domestic enforcement all represent
different opportunities to slice into the illicit industry, and
create possibilities for developing cases against illicit
traffickers. To see how this alternative strategy would work, it
is useful to introduce some different analytic terms. </p>

<p>Patrol versus Investigation. If the goal is to immobilize
trafficking organizations that are able to complete transactions
with ease and efficiency, the central problem is to determine who
the traffickers are and to develop evidence against them. This
sounds like a problem of criminal investigation, and so it is.
But all investigations must begin somewhere. In ordinary criminal
investigations the start is usually provided by a victim or
witness to the offense or by physical evidence available at the
site of the crime. In narcotics investigations there is no
victim, the witnesses are likely to be implicated in the crime,
and the physical evidence will not reveal much. On the other
hand, the traffickers are likely to continue committing offenses,
and therefore the opportunity to observe a crime occurring is
high, if the enforcement agencies can get themselves into
position to see it. </p>

<p>In practice this means that narcotics investigations are
extremely dependent on informants and undercover operators, who
can provide evidence themselves or produce sufficiently precise
and accurate information to justify a wire-tap or other less
intrusive but more expensive and less penetrating form of
surveillance. They can position the evidence-gathering
capabilities of enforcement agencies and how to infiltrate
undercover agents into the illicit industry. The question thus
becomes how to develop and use informants and how to use
informants and how to infiltrate undercover agents into the
illicit firms. </p>

<p>One answer to that question is to attack the illicit supply
systems in the places where it is least protected. This means on
the streets in central cities where the distribution system must
finally come into the open. Or, it means at the point that is
inherently vulnerable, where drugs are moved physically from one
place to another. Or, it means as raw materials are being
collected from remote fields in foreign countries. Surveillance
and undercover operations conducted in these areas will not only
frustrate transactions at these levels, and remove small stocks
of drugs, but they will also produce the rumors, the physical
evidence, and the potential informants who might provide the
basis for more intrusive and determined investigations of larger
networks. </p>

<p>This will not always work, of course. Many people arrested at
this level will be small scale, transient operators. Others will
be employees, but they may be unable to supply information. Still
others may know a great deal but be afraid to reveal it.
Moreover, there are other ways of developing informants. One can
offer large payments to those who are greedy, or protection to
those who are afraid, or both to potentially valuable sources.
And, just as low level enforcement operations against street
dealers, smugglers, and collectors in foreign countries can
produce potential informants,, all successful investigations
against medium and high level investigations can also yield
informants. Therefore, successful cases can be built from many
sources other than low level cases. </p>

<p>But the argument is that a high volume enforcement effort at
low levels is often quite valuable as a source of rumors,
intelligence and informants. In fact, there is an argument
supporting low level enforcement. Even more unexpectedly, there
is an argument for a low level enforcement that is not directed
or guided by intelligence about the operations of major
traffickers. </p>

<p>The strength of investigative efforts is their capacity to
make connections among known facts and inform enforcement
agencies how to position themselves to penetrate existing
trafficking organizations and develop evidence for a successful
prosecution. The weakness of investigation is that it becomes
increasingly narrow and discounts information that cannot be
related to something that is already known. In attacking
something as mysterious and dynamic as the illicit drug industry,
this tendency to become narrow is potentially very dangerous.
There is always the chance that one is concentrating on only a
small piece of the overall industry and that there is a newer or
better shielded piece that has so far escaped notice. If this is
true, the only way that enforcement agencies could discover this
is to look in areas where they didn't expect to find something.
That is the role of broad, untargeted low level enforcement
agencies. Like pickets and patrols sent out by a main military
force to maintain contact with a mysterious enemy force, agents
on the street, at the border, and in the bazaars of foreign
countries help the investigative forces stay in touch with the
emergence and development of new trafficking capabilities. </p>

<p>For analytic purposes it is useful to think of these broad,
low level enforcement operations as &quot;patrol&quot;
operations, which are scanning for drug offenses, and the
remaining pieces as &quot;investigative&quot; operations, which
can develop the leads into powerful cases that immobilize major
trafficking organizations. Moreover, in many ways, the patrol
operations perform better, if they are broad and random, rather
than narrowly targeted. A random strategy is more successful in
deterrence, and in disclosing previously unsuspected trafficking
networks. </p>

<p>The Role of Intelligence and Conspiracy Investigations. To
take full advantage of the potential relationship between
investigative and patrol functions and to produce the maximum
impact on trafficking organizations, it is necessary that some
previously neglected capabilities be more fully developed. Two
are particularly important: the intelligence function within the
investigative agencies, and the capacity to develop and prosecute
conspiracy cases within investigative and prosecutorial offices. </p>

<p>By the intelligence function, I mean the capacity to make
disciplined use of the information about trafficking networks
that is potentially available to the investigative agencies. This
is essential not only to take full advantage of any opportunities
that present themselves, but also to make sure the investigative
agencies are not misled by informants. As we have seen, there is
always an incentive for traffickers to inform on their
competitors. And there is always an incentive for enforcement
agencies to use the information and keep the informant alive.
This is acceptable as long as the informant is not more important
than the traffickers he is delivering to the enforcement
agencies. But if the informant is himself a dealer, then the
result of his informing looks like he and the enforcement agency
are colluding to maintain his position in the market. The only
way to guard against this is to have relatively accurate
information about both the informant and the target and to have
someone other than the case agent monitoring this situation. That
is something that a good intelligence analysis function could
provide. </p>

<p>The capacity to make conspiracy cases is essential because
there are many traffickers who can be revealed only through
conspiracy indictments. They may never be in direct contact with
drugs, or with the violence and corruption that provide the
structure within which the drugs can be confidently moved from
place to place and from person to person. In addition, conspiracy
cases have the advantage of simultaneously immobilizing many
pieces of a trafficking network, leaving no remnants from which a
new network might be constructed. If a single person is removed,
he may be replaced. If the entire network is eliminated,
replacement is more difficult because none of the personal
relationships that are so essential to successful trafficking
remain. </p>

<p>The challenges to investigators in making conspiracy cases are
partly matters of technique. Electronic surveillance is often an
essential ingredient, as are financial investigations. And each
require the development of special skills. Hut producing high
quality conspiracy investigations also requires a change in
attitude. They require patience - including situations where
enforcement agencies allow some dealers to continue operating
even though they are indictable. They also require risking
certain cases that are certain, for a future case that may or may
not develop. Finally, the prosecution of conspiracy cases often
depends on telling convincing stories rather than hard physical
evidence. Even though the stories night be a more accurate
account of what has been happening than the hard physical
evidence, it requires a real knack for analysis and inference to
make the story solid and convincing. In short, patience, a
willingness to take risks for an uncertain gain, and thought are
required, and these are not always qualities plentiful in
action-oriented enforcement agencies. Yet, without these, the
aggressive actions might have less impact than they otherwise
could. </p>

<p>Summary and Conclusions </p>

<p>Criminal statutes directed at illicit drug trafficking and use
are an important part of drug abuse policy. If they were
perfectly effective in discouraging people from drug trafficking
and drug abuse, there would be little need for any other
instruments. </p>

<p>The problem is that these laws are imperfectly effective: they
leave a residual market that consists of a continuing (but
smaller) demand for drugs, and a continuing (but smaller)
capacity to supply drugs to that market. To deal with the
continuing demand, the society relies on drug treatment and
preventive education programs. To deal with the continuing
supply, the country invests in diplomatic efforts to motivate
foreign countries to control drugs destined for the U.S.,
interdiction efforts to keep the drugs from landing on our
shores, domestic enforcement to disrupt trafficking networks and
discourage the aggressive marketing of drugs to non-users,
regulatory efforts to keep legitimate drugs contained in
legitimate channels of distribution and use. </p>

<p>These efforts on the supply side of the illegal drug market
are helpful in achieving the purposes of drug policy. They
increase the price and reduce the availability of drugs, and
therefore discourage new drug use and motivate older users to
abandon their drug use. But the laws create a problem for
organized crime policy, for they establish the soil from which an
illegal industry can grow. The firms that continue in the
industry will make a great deal of money as compensation for the
risks they run by continuing in the business. In addition, they
will engage in violence and corruption as crucial elements of
their strategies for surviving in an illicit industry. Finally,
some of the individuals and organizations involved in drug
trafficking may grow to become powerful criminal institutions
that seem to defy effective control by law enforcement agencies.
To the extent that these illicit firms become more adept at
dealing drugs, they may become not only an organized crime
problem, but an increased threat to the objectives of drug abuse
policy. Thus, the special instruments we associate with organized
crime policy must be deployed not only to deal with the organized
crime problem that is created by our drug abuse policy, but also
to prevent organized criminal groups from defeating the purposes
of drug abuse policy. </p>

<p>Viewed from the perspective of drug abuse policy, the central
objective of a strategy attacking the illegal drug industry is to
minimize the capacity of the illicit drug industry to supply
drugs to illicit markets. In terms of traditional analyses of
industrial organization, this objective can be described as
minimizing the &quot;performance&quot; of the illicit industry. </p>

<p>Viewed from the perspective of organized crime policy, the
central objectives are to prevent the development of wealthy and
powerful criminal groups and to reduce the violence and
corruption associated with the illicit drug industry. Again, in
the traditional analyses of industrial organization, these
objectives can be captured by attacking the structure and shaping
the conduct of the industry. </p>

<p>There may be some tension between the objectives of drug abuse
policy on the one hand, and organized crime on the policy on the
other. To the extent that the drug laws create the conditions
under which an illicit industry might arise, there is an obvious
conflict. Legalization of the drugs would almost certainly
increase the number of chronic, intensive drug users and
therefore make the drug problem worse. But it would also
eliminate drugs as an organized crime problem. Beyond this
observation is another paradox, however. From the perspective of
drug abuse policy, a highly concentrated industry may be
preferable to an atomized industry. A concentrated industry might
supply fewer drugs at higher prices than an atomized industry.
And, although each firm in the industry may be harder to attack
effectively, the impact of a successful attack might be larger
and more enduring than the results of ten successful attacks on
smaller firms that accounted for a smaller portion of the total
supply capacity and were easier to replace. From the perspective
of organized crime policy, however, a concentrated industry would
be worse because it would imply the existence of large, enduring
organizations of substantial power and influence. What is not in
conflict, however, is the need of both drug abuse policy and
organized crime policy to develop and use tactics that are
successful in attacking large, entrenched criminal organizations.
This is useful to drug policy and essential to organized crime
policy. </p>

<p>In controlling the supply of drugs to illicit markets the
United States relies on many instruments, in addition to
attacks&quot; on organized criminal groups that deal in drugs.
There is an &quot;international program&quot; that tends to focus
on the production of raw materials to produce heroin and cocaine.
This has the advantage of occasionally producing a significant
but short-lived result when a foreign country's increased
motivation and capacity to deal with the problem eliminates an
important source of supply to the U.S. But the value of the
instrument overall is limited by the widespread availability of
raw materials and the fact that U.S. objectives are always
hostage to the motivations and capacities of foreign governments.
</p>

<p>There is also an &quot;interdiction program&quot; designed to
intercept the drugs and shipment before they cross U.S. borders.
This has the advantage of creating a significant obstacle to
traffickers and inflicting economic losses on traffickers as a
result of seizures. It has the disadvantages of focusing
principally on the inventories of drugs rather than on the
organizations that continue to send them, and of being relatively
less successful in dealing with heroin and cocaine than with
marijuana. </p>

<p>Finally there is a &quot;domestic enforcement program&quot;,
designed to attack domestic trafficking organizations, and to
discourage the aggressive marketing of drugs through street level
enforcement. This program has the advantages of focusing on the
trafficking organizations and engaging the substantial resources
of the nation's 400,000 local police officers. It has the
disadvantages to being only occasionally successful in
eliminating major trafficking organizations. </p>

<p>What appears to be missing in this common conception of the
nation's strategy against the supply of drugs to illicit markets
is precisely the perspective that a focus on international
criminal organizations would bring. It seems likely that the
capacity to execute large scale transactions in the risky
environment of an illicit industry is in long run, short supply
in the illicit drug industry. The firms that can overcome these
difficulties are likely to be large scale, enduring,
organizations with a well established reputation for irresistible
violence. Thus, these firms - in all likelihood, international
firms - should become the main targets of a supply reduction/
organized crime policy. </p>

<p>If this is the principal target, one's view of how the society
should deploy it resources should change dramatically. The
interdiction and domestic enforcement programs are suddenly seen
principally as &quot;patrol operations&quot;, which can produce
intelligence and informants to be used in mounting attacks on
major trafficking organizations. Moreover, the focus of the
international program should shift from concerns about crop
control to the support of foreign enforcement efforts and the
negotiation of treaties, which would allow the more convenient
prosecution of drug traffickers whose crimes cross national
boundaries. Finally, major investments should be made in the
capabilities of intelligence agencies and an orientation towards
sustained conspiracy cases among investigators and prosecutors.
This strategy holds the greatest potential to achieve the
objectives of both drug abuse policy and organized crime policy.
Moreover, this strategy depends most heavily on the continuing
development of our capacity to deal with organized criminal
groups no matter what illegal goods and services they happen to
be supplying.<br>

<h1>America's Habit </h1>

<h2>Drug Abuse, Drug Trafficking, &amp; Organized Crime </h2>

<p><b>President's Commission on Organized Crime, 1986 </b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<h2>Consultant Paper: Winning the War Against Drugs </h2>

<p>By Mitchell S. Rosenthal, M.D. Submitted: October 1, 1985. Dr.
Rosenthal is President of the Phoenix House Foundation, a drug
rehabilitation program. </p>

<p>There is a popular perception these days that America is
locked in a &quot;no win&quot; struggle against drugs. This
notion of &quot;the endless battle,&quot; in which we seem unable
to prevail, that has prompted a good many lawyers, scientists,
and writers to suggest that it might be time for the United
States to quit. </p>

<p>Some Americans have always believed that the use of certain
illicit drugs is not such a terrible thing and others have argued
that the government has no right to tell citizens what they can
or cannot ingest. But the strongest opposition to the nation's
drug laws and policies has come from those who believe that they
should be scrapped because they do not work well. The latest
converts to this cause contend that legalization of marijuana and
cocaine (some would include heroin) would eliminate drug profits
and crime overnight and substantially reduce the costly burden of
enforcing drug laws. </p>

<p>The &quot;quit now&quot; crowd plainly does not recognize that
there is a world of difference between &quot;not winning&quot; a
war and &quot;losing&quot; one. The war against drugs, although
it is going badly at the moment, is far from lost. But quitting
now and attempting to solve the drug crime problem through
legalization would he tantamount to losing - at least in terms of
the impact on drug abuse. </p>

<p>The notion that we could make drugs legal, while
simultaneously mounting (as some advocates of legalization
suggest) a massive public education campaign to discourage their
use would give cocaine and marijuana the same status as
cigarettes. The most likely result, according to the former
director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, would be a
tenfold increase in cocaine use. There would be just about as
many Americans using cocaine as now smoke cigarettes. </p>

<p>Another reason not to give up the fight is because we can win.
After more than 20 years of treating and curing drug abuse, I see
enough evidence to convince me that the war is winnable - not
now, but in time. It is winnable because what denies us victory
today is the nature of the war we are waging and not the nature
of the enemy we are fighting. </p>

<p>The war is going badly for much the same reasons that any war
goes badly. In part, it is inappropriate strategy fighting the
wrong enemy, in the wrong place and with the wrong weapons. In
part, it is a failure of will. </p>

<p>We are on the defensive, with battle lines stretching along
our borders. Our main weapon is interdiction. Most of the billion
dollars a year the Federal government spends enforcing drug laws
(two-thirds of all it spends to fight drug abuse) goes to halt
the flow of illicit drugs into our country. </p>

<p>Yet, the drugs keep flowing, even though 13 tons of cocaine
and 1,500 tons of marijuana (with a total street value of $11
billion) were seized by federal agents last year. It would seem
that when $5 million or $50 million or $500 million worth of
drugs is impounded, the total available for distribution would he
reduced by a like amount. Hut that is not the case. Drugs lost
through seizure are instantly replaced by producers and
importers. The more Federal agents seize at our end of the
pipeline, the more drug traffickers feed into the other end.
Although interdiction efforts have expanded dramatically and vast
quantities of drugs have been seized, the flow to the street has
diminished hardly at all, and cost to consumers has actually
fallen. </p>

<p>In frustration, Americans have turned their ire on producing
nations. Apparently, we feel more comfortable and justified
pressuring Colombians, Peruvians and Bolivians to stop producing
cocaine than pressuring Americans to stop using it. </p>

<p>In spite of minimal success, we remain committed to battling
drugs primarily by reducing supply rather than by reducing
demand. Yet, the supply side is obviously harder to hit and to
hurt. Producers are beyond our reach. Major dealers are
sophisticated, secretive, and ruthless, willing to accept
enormous risks and enormous losses as long as profits remain
equally enormous. </p>

<p>The demand side, however, is easier to reach. It is vast,
barely concealed at all these days, and it consists of the more
than 20 million Americans who now regularly use illicit drugs.
What's more, the demand side is where all three weapons at our
disposal can be deployed - not only law enforcement, but drug
treatment and drug prevention as well. </p>

<p>Our reluctance to attack demand as vigorously as we attack
supply reflects nothing less than a failure of will - not on the
part of the administration, law enforcement agencies or drug
abuse professionals, but on the part of the American public.
Public attitudes and public expectations determine how we go
about fighting this war, limit how much we can do and how far we
dare go. </p>

<p>What limits drug treatment is not just reduced government
support. Even if resources were available, there is no way we
could help the great majority of drug abusers in this country to
overcome their drug dependency because most of them are not
seeking help. They are not seeking help because society does not
require them, and the law does not compel them. </p>

<p>Limits on what drug prevention can accomplish reflect what can
only be called a public demand for selective prevention the
prevention of some but not necessarily all drug use. Just about
everyone wants to prevent one kind of drug use or another. Most
parents believe that kids shouldn't use drugs. Most employers are
convinced that workers ought not use them. The public in general
would like to see criminals stop using drugs and stop stealing in
order to buy drugs. But, beyond this point, public demand softens
considerably and attitudes become ambivalent. </p>

<p>Nowhere is our ambivalence more evident than in our attitudes
towards law enforcement. We are content with a &quot;trickle
down&quot; approach - one that focuses almost exclusively on
putting major dealers behind bars. But we learned during the days
of strict enforcement in New York State during the 1960's and
from recent crackdowns on street dealers in New York City, that
the real victories of law enforcement are not the number of
dealers or users arrested or convicted but the number motivated
to seek treatment. We know that when it becomes too dangerous or
too difficult to sell drugs or to buy them, then a great deal of
drug use will simply disappear and demand for treatment will rise
rapidly to the level of real need. </p>

<p>Lenient or selective enforcement of drug laws - what amounts
to non-enforcement and de facto legalization - in some areas - is
a reflection of our ambivalence. It comes down to the way that
Americans feel personally about drugs - not only about our own
use, but about use by our grown and half-grown children and by
our friends, and about what is wrongheadedly called
&quot;recreational&quot; use of marijuana and cocaine. While it
may make us uncomfortable, most of us do not think of it in the
same way as we think about drug use by nine- and ten-year-olds or
about the heroin addiction of criminals. And we are generally
unwilling to see our friends and children at risk of arrest and
prosecution because of drug use. </p>

<p>But I do not believe we can win the war against drugs until we
have positive consensus on the strict enforcement of drug laws.
However, we need not make that decision any harder than it must
be. We don't have to agree that drug users should go to jail. The
purpose of drug laws is not punishment - certainly not when
applied to users. These laws serve what must be recognized as a
public health function - a means of controlling a contagious
disease by imposing on its carriers the requirement of whatever
it takes in the way of education and treatment to overcome their
drug use. </p>

<p>We are not likely to see this consensus come soon. Too many
drug-using young adults are still convinced they enjoy some
special &quot;right&quot; to use illicit drugs and believe they
can handle them. Too many Americans are torn between the urge to
condemn behavior, of which they disapprove, and the need to
tolerate behavior they have somehow come to believe is a matter
of individual freedom or simply none of their business. </p>

<p>But both drug users and drug tolerators ignore the contagious
nature of drug abuse. The hostess who overlooks a little discreet
after-dinner pot-smoking or the professional who pointedly
ignores covert coke-sniffing by his or her colleagues must
eventually come to realize that a person can no more tolerate a
little recreational drug use than he or she can tolerate a little
recreational smallpox. As for users, even those convinced that
their own drug habits are under control cannot guarantee that the
friends, coworkers or teenagers they influence will be able to
avoid drug dependency and the other high risks of drug use. Nor
is there any basis for them to believe that they will continue to
enjoy immunity from the costs of drug use - if indeed they enjoy
it now. </p>

<p>Broad societal disapproval of illicit drug use is needed
before we can come to a consensus about strict drug law
enforcement. Needless to say, active disapproval and the use of
informal social sanctions will make more aggressive law
enforcement irrelevant in most cases. The hostess who is certain
enough of her own unwillingness to tolerate pot smoking in her
home doesn't need to call the cops to keep her guests from
lighting up - no more than she need call them to stop her guests
from stealing the silver or spitting in the soup. Nor do
professionals who recognize the danger of drug use to their
colleagues, need to turn to the law. They have far more effective
ways of bringing the behavior of these colleagues into line -
once they accept the need to draw such a line. </p>

<p>In many ways our society resembles the American family in the
1960's. Many parents then believed they were doing their children
a favor by laying back and not taking a hard-line stand against
drugs. They allowed youngsters to stumble through the drug
experience. Only later they came to realize the costs. Those
costs ran high, both in chronic impairment and lost educational
and career opportunities. As a result, parental attitudes have
changed markedly. Parents are now taking the hard line, which is
really the loving line, one that shows responsible concern. </p>

<p>More recently, the Navy has demonstrated how to go about
attacking drug use on the demand side. While it brought heavy
weapons into play - drug tests and disciplinary actions - it also
effectively reduced widespread tolerance for drug use. By
stressing the interdependence of seamen, the Navy began replacing
this attitude with a far more responsible one expressed by the
motto: &quot;Not on my watch, not on my ship, not in my
Navy.&quot; </p>

<p>This is the kind of attitudinal change I expect to see
occurring throughout the country over the next decade. It is
already underway. Adolescents have become far more critical of
drug use by their friends, and this is the result not only of
better drug education in the schools, but also of more awareness
of drug dangers on the street. Employers are now responding to
increasing evidence of economic costs directly attributable to
drug use in the work force. </p>

<p>So, there is every reason to believe that public attitudes
about illicit drugs will become firmer and more responsible. As a
result, the limitations on what we have been able to achieve
through prevention, through treatment, and through law
enforcement, will gradually be removed. They will no longer
dictate strategy that prevent us from moving as aggressively
against domestic demand as we do against foreign supply. </p>

<p>If law enforcement is to work effectively in cooperation with
treatment and with prevention in this attack on the demand side,
then we need to adopt consistent goals. While we should certainly
persist in interdiction and target major dealers, we cannot focus
most of our energy and resources on these high visibility
efforts. It is on the street that the final battle is going to be
won, and it will be won by constant pressure, over time, that
will be felt by every drug dealer and every drug user. </p>

<p>This kind of pressure will not result in any impressive string
of convictions, but it will respond directly to the desperate
needs of drug-ridden communities. It will strengthen
drug-troubled families, and it will improve the quality of life
for millions of Americans. </p>

<p>This kind of pressure, supported by a popular mandate, will
result in the gradual erosion of the drug market and the gradual
decline of drug use. Demand for treatment will grow. Prevention
will cease to be selective but reach out broadly across all
society. And drug abuse, while it may never entirely disappear,
will cease to pose any substantial threat to the nation, its
youth.<br>

<h1>America's Habit </h1>

<h2>Drug Abuse, Drug Trafficking, &amp; Organized Crime </h2>

<p><b>President's Commission on Organized Crime, 1986 </b></p>

<hr>

<h2>Consultant Paper: Preventing Drug Abuse: What Can We Do? </h2>

<p>By Dr. Arnold M. Washton. Submitted: October 1, 1985. Dr.
Washton is Director of the Addiction Research and Treatment
Center, The Regent Hospital, New York, New York; and Research
Director of The National Cocaine Hotline &quot;800-COCAINE,&quot;
Fair Oaks Hospital, Summit, New Jersey. </p>

<p>The most dramatic increase in drug use has occurred since the
1960's, a time of radical change in political and social beliefs,
lifestyles and mores. Traditional values, authorities, and
restrictions on behavior were vehemently challenged. Psychoactive
drugs and the breakdown of traditional taboos against using them
became symbols of the rebellion against the established order. We
have come to recognize in the 1980's that we are paying a very
high price for the casual attitude towards drugs that developed
in the 1960's. Much misinformation has been corrected, and we
have begun to formulate a more realistic appraisal of the
problem, but now we must take specific actions to reduce the
demand for drugs. </p>

<p>Interventions that merely condemn drug use and try to frighten
children about the potential dangers (&quot;scare tactics&quot;)
are futile. The most effective prevention strategies are those
that address the factors that make drugs attractive and thwart
the process that leads youngsters to try them. Children use drugs
for many different reasons. Usually there are at least several
factors that enter into the decision to experiment or continue
with drug use. Drug use itself is no evidence that parents have
failed to properly raise their children. Many children with a
good family upbringing have yielded to the enormous outside
pressures to use drugs. The influence of peers can often override
even the best parental input. </p>

<p>Effective drug abuse prevention must address the most basic
and fundamental forces that promote drug-taking in our society.
These fall into two main categories: supply and demand. </p>

<p>Reducing Supply </p>

<p>Reducing the supply of illicit drugs is an obvious way of
curtailing use. Although this does little to alter the demand for
drugs, the widespread availability and abundant supplies of many
different types of powerful mood-altering substances makes it
easier for our citizens to become involved in drug use. It
reinforces the notion that illicit drugs are an expected part of
American life. People are more likely to try drugs when they are
surrounded by them - and children are no exception. Most American
adolescents know someone who &quot;deals&quot; drugs, uses drugs,
or is able to get them. </p>

<p>To counter the supply problem, we must continue to enforce and
strengthen our laws against the manufacture, sale, and possession
of drugs. We must also take a firmer stand against drug-producing
countries that receive American foreign aid. </p>

<p>The failure of Prohibition is a dramatic example of how
difficult it is to eliminate the use of a drug by law enforcement
efforts alone; especially when the drug is so well-entrenched in
society. Nonetheless, to legalize drugs, such as cocaine,
marijuana, or heroin would cause nothing short of a national
disaster. When drugs are cheaper and more readily available, more
people use them, become addicted to them, and suffer serious
consequences to their health and functioning. Legalization of
drugs would create an epidemic of unprecedented proportions. </p>

<p>Although enforcement efforts are necessary to check abuse,
they cannot prevent the problem by themselves. Neither can
treatment programs, which are utilized only after a serious drug
abuse problem has been identified. </p>

<p>Reducing Demand </p>

<p>Prevention of drug use in the United States must focus
intensively on the problem of demand. The cultural forces that
encourage and perpetuate drug use in our society must be
eliminated. We must recognize that drugs have become a
deeply-ingrained part of American life and that prevention cannot
occur unless social attitudes toward drug use change. Changing
social attitudes toward drugs is a difficult undertaking, but not
an impossible one. Many segments of society must become involved
in the effort. The message that drug use is unacceptable,
unhealthy, and unnecessary must be communicated in a credible and
consistent manner by the family, schools, media, business
community, medical and legal experts, politicians, professional
athletes, and other public figures. This message must be
reflected in every aspect of American life including education,
entertainment, business management practices, and law
enforcement. Being free of drugs must become a highly desirable
personal attribute: one that is seen as mandatory for success in
our society. One might hope that non-involvement with drugs would
become at least as desirable as physical fitness and
attractiveness. </p>

<p>Several prevention strategies are outlined below. </p>

<p>Recommendations </p>

<p>1. Public Education and Media Campaigns. The media is
potentially one of our most powerful prevention tools. It could
be used to better educate the public about the dangers of drugs
and to change attitudes about drug use through direct and
indirect communications. Public service messages, educational
programs, documentaries, and greater efforts to eliminate
pro-drug programs, might help to counteract accepting attitudes
toward drugs. </p>

<p>2. School-based Prevention Programs. Every school system in
the United States must have an active and creative drug abuse
prevention program. Prevention efforts, such as saying
&quot;NO&quot; to drugs and learning of their potential dangers,
must start in the early grades, not just in high school. Studies
show that drug use often starts before the 7th grade and that by
the time youngsters reach teenage it may be too late to change
their attitudes about drugs or their willingness to
&quot;try&quot; drugs. Nonetheless, early identification of
drug-abusing youngsters and swift efforts to ameliorate the
problem are essential in our nation's high schools. </p>

<p>In this regard, the &quot;Student Assistance Program&quot;
(SAP) in New York's Westchester County has served as a model
program to other school systems around the country. The SAP is
based on the EAP (Employee Assistance Program) model used
successfully in business and industry, utilizing on-site
substance abuse counselors, who are especially skilled at
identifying drug-abusing youngsters and providing the necessary
assistance or referral. </p>

<p>3. Education of Health Professionals. Despite epidemic levels
of drug abuse over the past two decades, most health
professionals receive no formal training in the diagnosis and
treatment of drug dependency. This situation must be corrected by
mandating that a core curriculum in the clinical management of
drug abuse problems be part of the training of physicians,
nurses, psychologists, social workers, and other health
professionals. </p>

<ol>
    <li>Drug Testing in DWIs. Currently, not a single state in
        the United States requires drug testing of drivers
        stopped for suspected driving under the influence of
        alcohol. Someone &quot;stoned&quot; on drugs may be able
        to pass a breathalyzer test with no difficulty, but still
        be too impaired to drive safely. </li>
</ol>

<h1>George Remus - a Prohibition Saga</h1>

<p><b>Summarized by Bob Ramsey</b> </p>

<hr>

<p>The story of George Remus is fascinating in its own right,
emcompassing love, jealousy, crime, enormous wealth, retribution,
murder, and courtroom drama. It also shows very clearly how
prohibition warps society with irresistible incentives. </p>

<p>This version of the story is excerpted from THE LONG THIRST-
PROHIBITION IN AMERICA: 1920-1933 by Thomas M. Coffey WW Norton
&amp; Co, New York City 1975 </p>

<p><b>SYNOPSIS:</b> </p>

<hr>

<p>George Remus was born in Germany in 1876 and migrated to
Chicago at the age of 5. </p>

<p>His father was incapacitated when he was 14 and George
supported the family by working at a pharmacy, which he bought at
age 19. Within 5 more years, he bought another drugstore,
married, and had a daughter. He became a lawyer in 1900, at age
24. </p>

<p>He specialized in criminal defense, especially murder, and
became rather famous. By 1920 he was earning $50,000 a year (when
gold was $20 per ounce). He divorced after developing an ongoing
affair with his beautiful and ambitious secretary (Imogene), who
had a 13 year-old daughter (Ruth). Alcohol Prohibition started in
January 1920, and within a few months Remus saw that his clients,
a generally crude and ignorant lot, were becoming very wealthy
very quickly. He was sure he could do better than them with his
intelligence and knowledge of the law. </p>

<p>He memorized the Volstead Act (that enforced prohibition) and
found loopholes whereby he could buy distilleries and pharmacies
so as to sell liquor to himself under government licenses for <u>medicinal
purposes</u>. Most of the liquor would disappear on the way to
market. He moved to Cincinnati because 80 percent of America's
bonded whiskey was within 300 miles, and bought up most of
America's best-known whiskey manufacturers. </p>

<p>In less than three years he made $40 million ($760M in 1995
dollars). He bribed hundreds of police, judges, and government
officials including $500,000 to the U.S. Attorney General. </p>

<p>George and Imogene held a lavish party at their new mansion on
New Year's Eve of 1922-23. The guests included 100 couples who
were as well-connected as one could imagine. At dawn the Remus's
presented all their male guests with diamond jewelry, and gave
each guest's wife a brand new automobile for the drive home. This
was the high point. </p>

<p>Prohibition enforcement stepped up shortly and Remus found
himself sentenced to two years in Atlanta Federal Penitentiary,
which was (for rich inmates) much like a luxury hotel. </p>

<p>While Remus was in prison, his wife Imogene took up with an
extremely handsome prohibition agent named Franklin Dodge. Dodge
soon resigned from the Bureau of Prohibition. Together, he and
Imogene liquidated Remus' assets and hid as much of the money as
possible. They did various unkind things to him such as: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Imogene gave George $100 as his share of the proceeds
        when she sold the Fleischman Company. </li>
    <li>At one point she tried to have him deported, claiming his
        father had never become a citizen. </li>
    <li>Dodge and Mrs. Remus reportedly offered a gang $15,000 to
        murder George. </li>
</ul>

<p>Imogene proceeded to divorce him in late 1927. On the day the
divorce was to be finalized, on the way to court Remus had his
chauffeur chase the cab carrying Imogene and her daughter through
Cincinnati, finally forcing it off the road. Remus jumped out
screaming and shot her dead while her daughter tried to stop him.
</p>

<p>Remus the expert criminal defender was now on trial for his
life. The trial made national headlines for a month, sharing
front pages with Lindbergh's flight to Paris. Remus pleaded
temporary insanity, a novel approach at the time. </p>

<p>Having long been the most generous man in town, he was very
popular in Cincinnati, and he so successfully vilified Imogene
and her boyfriend Dodge that the jury deliberated only 19 minutes
before acquitting him by reason of insanity. The courtroom
erupted in shamefully exuberant jubilation. </p>

<p>The state of Ohio then tried to commit him to an insane asylum
since the jury found him insane, but prosecutors were thwarted by
their previous claim (backed up by the prosecution's three
well-known psychiatrists) that he could be tried for murder
because was not insane. </p>

<p>Remus tried to get back into bootlegging, but soon retired
when he found that the market had been taken over by vicious,
well-armed gangsters. He moved across the Ohio river to a
(relatively) modest home in Covington, Kentucky, and lived out
his life for another 20-odd years in relative obscurity. </p>

<h2 align="center">A little levity about arrogance<br>
<strong>by Clifford A. Schaffer</strong> </h2>

<p align="center">Some of us are destined for greatness. And the
others . . .</p>

<hr>

<p>There are a certain number of people in the world who believe,
for whatever reason, that they have the one true answer to some
major problem of their time. For a few of them, the belief is
strong enough that they charge off like Don Quixote, arrogantly
determined to make the whole rest of the world conform to their
view of reality. For a tiny, rare percentage of them it is an
actual historical truth that they have the one true answer to a
major problem. By far the majority, however, are just plain,
garden-variety nuts destined to go to their deathbed thinking
they almost had it. If you happen to be a person so afflicted,
how can you tell whether you really are one of these unique
people in history, or just a plain, old nut? </p>

<p>Consider, for example, the true story of Emperor Joshua
Norton. </p>

<p>Joshua Norton was a businessman in San Francisco in the
1800's. In the 1840's, just before the Gold Rush, he tried to
corner the market on rice and failed. He went from being very
wealthy to being destitute overnight and the experience
completely shattered his reason. A couple of months after this
event, he put on a formal admiral's uniform, complete with gold
braid and epaulets and strode in to the office of the newspaper.
He handed the editor a large, official looking proclamation which
stated in quite formal language that, due to popular demand, he
hereby declared himself Emperor Norton I of San Francisco,
California, and Mexico. He bade all his subjects show him loyalty
and the other courtesies due a person of such eminent stature. </p>

<p>From the pictures of Emperor Norton, it is immediately
apparent that this guy has gone around the bend and ain't coming
back. His eyes pointed in different directions, and neither one
quite caught straight ahead. His uniform was formal to the point
of almost gaudy and, at the same time, it was quite apparent that
he and soap were not of regular acquaintance. </p>

<p>The editor, with a rich sense of humor, decided to publish the
proclamation on the front page of the newspaper, in all
seriousness. The citizens of San Francisco, being what they are,
immediately decided that this sounded like a good idea and, by
unanimous acclamation, accepted Norton as their Emperor. It is
undoubtedly the only time in history they ever had an unanimous
vote on anything. </p>

<p>He reigned for about forty years. During that time he ate in
all of the finest restaurants and slept in the finest hotels for
free -- because he was the Emperor. He had three seats
permanently reserved in the front row of the San Francisco opera
house -- one for him, and one each for his two dogs. Twice a year
he would review the police and fire departments as they paraded
by, and then he would make a grand speech to the assembled
crowds. He printed his own money, which was accepted in business
establishments around San Francisco as legal tender. When
bicycles first came out, they got him a bicycle, too, and he
looked all the more daft because of it. When one of his dogs
died, 10,000 people turned out for the funeral to console their
grief-stricken emperor. When the Civil War rolled around, he
graciously offered his alliance and military support to Abraham
Lincoln, who politely declined. </p>

<p>Make no mistake about it, the Emperor Norton was as good a
loony as you have ever run across and I can't help feeling that a
man who was that intelligent must have had some idea of just how
completely nuts he really was. </p>

<p>Now here's the problem. During his reign as Emperor, Norton
came up with three major ideas: </p>

<p>1) He called upon the other leaders of the world to join him
in forming a League of Nations where disputes between nations
could be resolved peacefully. </p>

<p>2) He suggested that parts of San Francisco Bay be filled in
to make more room to build. </p>

<p>3) He proposed that a suspension-span bridge be built across
the spot where the Golden Gate stands now. He even laid out a
complete design that looks remarkably close to the bridge that
was built sixty years after he died. He correctly predicted that
only a suspension span bridge would have the strength to span
such a large stretch, and the flexibility to stand up under the
extreme stress which would be placed on such a structure. He did
this at a time when the only suspension bridges ever built were
rope bridges in remote parts of Africa. </p>

<p>Of course, when he proposed these ideas, the response was long
and uproarious laughter -- the Emperor was up to his old tricks
again. In time, all of his ideas became reality. At the time, no
one believed him. </p>

<p>It has occurred to me that Jesus must have had the same
problem. Think of what must have happened when he showed up for
his high school reunion. </p>

<p>&quot;Hey fellas,&quot; He says. &quot;You'll never believe
what happened. It turns out I really AM the Messiah.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, right,&quot; his school chums say. &quot;If you're
the Messiah, where's your Porsche?&quot; </p>

<p>That's probably why he spent all his time doing miracles like
turning water into wine -- nobody took him seriously until he
showed up with the booze. </p>

<p>So put yourself in Emperor Norton's position and consider what
you might do. Suppose you are strolling down the street one day,
perhaps toking your favorite blend, and a big bolt of lightning
comes out of the sky and blasts you right out of your shoes. When
you come to, you are thoroughly convinced that you have the one
true insight which, unique among men, has given you the answer to
one or more of society's most troubling problems. What are you to
do? </p>

<p>If you keep quiet about it, the world could be missing one of
the best emperors ever to come along. Everyone loses, including
you. </p>

<p>If you act on it, tell everyone about it, and attempt to
install yourself as emperor then you could do some real good for
both you and posterity. Certainly, if you can really save the
world then it seems almost a moral obligation to try. Of course,
if you try, you have to face the fact that, statistically
speaking, it is far more likely that you are a nut than an
emperor, and far more likely that you will be laughed at than
taken seriously. There have been lots and lots of nuts, and only
a handful of emperors. </p>

<p>So what should you do? I think the only thing you can do is
act on the belief, keep an enormous sense of humor, and be
content with the fact that you might wind up in the encyclopedia
next to Emperor Norton. But that's just my take on the situation.

<h1>The Unluckiest Guy I Ever Met </h1>

<p><b>by Clifford A. Schaffer</b> </p>

<p>This is a true story. The facts have not been embellished. In
fact, I left a lot of stuff out. </p>

<hr>

<p>When I first met Art in the late 1960's, he had just gotten
out of prison the first time and was in college, desperately
trying to make a go of his life. He was a bit scroungy in his
appearance, but everybody was a little scroungy in those days and
the truth was that Art never did have the money for fine clothes.
He did the best he could. Art was one the nicest, friendliest,
and most agreeable people I ever met. As a friend, I enjoyed his
company on every occasion and found that Art was not a complete
angel (neither was I, for that matter), but there was no reason
to ever believe that he might be any real threat to society. </p>

<p>But Art was the unluckiest soul I have ever run across. For
example, the first time Art went to prison, it was for stealing
his own motorcycle. He was later arrested and/or went to prison
for burglarizing his own apartment, stealing a mattress from a
Salvation Army box, and for selling marijuana that even the
police knew wasn't his. Those are only a few of the misfortunes
which befell him and I haven't even gotten to the part about his
lawyer. I will explain. </p>

<hr>

<h3>Stealing His Own Motorcycle </h3>

<p>When Art became old enough to get a driver's license, he
worked hard and saved his money until he was able to buy the
vehicle of his dreams, a three-wheeled motorcycle. When he
thought he had enough money, about $1,000 as I recall, he
searched around and found a three-wheeled motorcycle for sale at
a local wrecking yard. The owner of the wrecking yard was not
well-renowned for his honest business dealings, and Art probably
should have been more cautious but Art was so dazzled with the
prospect of fulfilling his dream that he bought it anyway. As Art
tells it, the owner of the wrecking yard made certain promises
about the mechanical fitness of the vehicle and Art quickly found
out that the vehicle was in no shape to be driven. </p>

<p>Art called the owner of the junkyard, raised the riot act, and
demanded that repairs be made immediately. The owner of the
junkyard told him to bring the bike on over and he would fix it
up. Art did so. </p>

<p>About a week later Art showed up to pick up his bike. It was
all repaired and ready for the road, complete with a bill from
the junkyard owner for several hundred dollars worth of repairs.
Art went ballistic, screaming and shouting that he had been
robbed and that the junkyard owner had warranted that the vehicle
was in good shape when he bought it. It was an old story, the
used car dealer with a mechanic's lien against the injured buyer
- who are you going to believe? </p>

<p>Art left in a rage and his common sense, which never was in
great supply, left him completely. The next weekend, he went to
the wrecking yard when it was closed, cut the lock on the gate,
went in, got his bike, and took it home. </p>

<p>On Monday morning, it was perfectly obvious to the junkyard
owner what had happened. The lock was cut and only one thing was
missing. This didn't take Sherlock Holmes to figure out. He had
long experience in turning such situations to his advantage. He
quickly called the police, reported the theft and, in addition,
claimed that several thousand dollars of other goods had been
taken. Who can tell what is missing from a junkyard? </p>

<p>The police simply stopped by Art's house, found the bike in
the driveway, and hauled him off to jail. The DA then trumpeted
the news that a major theft ring had been broken and shipped Art
off to prison. The proof that Art was part of a major burglary
ring was supplied by the fact that there really wasn't much
evidence. They expected, from the junkyard owner's description of
the incident, that there would be tons of stuff in Art's garage.
As it was, there was nothing but the bike which indicated only
one possible conclusion - he must have stolen tons of the stuff
and been able to fence all of it in less than 48 hours -
obviously a major theft ring. The DA and cops got a lot of good
publicity for saving the community from this awful scourge. Fine
police work saved the day, they said. </p>

<p>The junkyard owner got Art's money, the bike, and payment from
the insurance company for the items &quot;stolen&quot; but not
recovered. Art's lawyer got a mortgage on Art's parents' house.
The situation worked out great for everybody, except Art. A
couple of years later, when I met him, Art was still dealing with
insurance company people who were pursuing him and his parents
for reimbursement of the stuff he never stole. </p>

<p>For that he got a sentence of about five years, which netted
down to about 18 months in prison. He might have deserved a day
in jail and a short lecture about mechanics liens. </p>

<p>When I walked down the street with Art, or appeared in any
public place, it was immediately apparent that the Sacramento
County Sheriffs had it in for him. I am not sure whether they
really believed that Art ran a major theft ring as had been
alleged or whether they just didn't like his looks, or just
didn't like Art. I suspect it was the latter. He was an easy
target to pick on, and my personal impression was that they did
it just because a number of them were plainly sadistic and they
liked easy targets. </p>

<p>From that point forward, Art was likely to be stopped
anywhere, any time, by any Sheriff who happened to see him,
without any real cause that I could determine. They just made it
a point to hound him wherever they saw him. </p>

<hr>

<h3>The Mattress Incident </h3>

<p>Art got out of prison and enrolled in the local junior
college. Art had no money and his parents had been effectively
bankrupted by the legal experience so Art was in a daily struggle
just to keep food in his belly and clothes on his back. But there
was no question that he was trying to get an education and point
himself in the right direction. </p>

<p>Because of the financial strains at home, Art moved out of his
parents' house and got a small two-room cottage.
&quot;Small&quot; is the operative word. The &quot;bedroom&quot;
was literally not big enough to put a double bed in, and the
kitchen was smaller. Mice and roaches? Of course. It was simply
the best Art could do. </p>

<p>Life was extremely tough for Art. There wasn't much employment
available for anyone, let alone ex-cons, and he lived a
day-to-day, hand-to-mouth existence. Beset by financial
pressures, he turned to dealing marijuana on a small time basis,
using some of the contacts he had met in prison. That income was
&quot;iffy&quot; at best and Art had to use nearly all of it just
to eat, pay the rent, and support his dilapidated pickup truck,
which meant he didn't have any furniture. That is, the only thing
he had to sleep on was the linoleum floor. </p>

<p>He went out driving with his friend John one night and noticed
a mattress that someone had dumped at a Salvation Army donation
box. It seemed pretty clear to both of them that Art was just the
kind of person for whom such a donation was intended, so they
proceeded to load it in to the back of Art's pickup truck. As
they were doing so, the Sheriff pulled up. John, a tall
long-legged guy, had an ounce of weed in his pants so he quickly
hurdled two or three six-foot fences and was gone into the night.
Art was stuck. </p>

<p>The deputies started their standard routine of harassing Art
for everything they could think of. They first hit him with every
kind of mechanical citation they could on the truck, but that
wasn't much. Then they told Art they had found a joint on the
running board. Art, by this time, had learned the drill and
pointed out that, realistically, such a charge would never stick
and would just be a waste of time for both of them. Frustrated,
the cops decided to charge him with stealing the mattress. Art,
of course, clammed up and said nothing. </p>

<p>They stuffed Art and the mattress into the back of their
patrol car and drove down to the main jail in downtown
Sacramento, about fifteen miles away from where Art was arrested.
When they got downtown, they talked it over with their superiors
and decided that - despite all the danger that mattress-stealing
represented to the community - there was no way they could make
the charges stick in court. The reason was that they had caught
Art with the mattress half in, and half out, of his pickup truck
and they couldn't tell for sure whether Art was stealing the
mattress, or dropping it off. I am sure it disappointed them. </p>

<p>So they went to Art, gave him the news and showed him the exit
door. He asked for a ride back to his truck which was greeted
with great hilarity all around. Art just turned slowly and walked
to the door. As he reached the door they called out &quot;Wait!
Don't forget your mattress!&quot; </p>

<p>They explained that he certainly couldn't leave his mattress
there and would have to take it with him. Art considered telling
them that the mattress wasn't really his, but quickly realized
that, if he did so, and refused to take the mattress, they would
bust him again for stealing it. He asked for a ride again which,
he later told me, provoked absolutely panic-stricken laughter.
&quot;They were in tears!&quot; he said. </p>

<p>Art left the building dragging his mattress behind him, and
went out on the street to try to hitchhike home. He was tired,
looked a little scroungy anyway, and was carrying a mattress, all
of which is a real hindrance to efficient hitchhiking. He
considered just dumping the mattress and walking home, but there
were regular police patrols going by to watch his progress and
make sure that he didn't litter. Then it began to rain. </p>

<p>Holding the mattress over his head allowed him to keep the
rain off of himself, but it meant that the mattress got
progressively heavier with each step - and he still had more than
ten miles to go. Late that night, after several hours of struggle
with the wet mattress, an undercover narc picked Art up, allowed
Art to stuff the wet mattress in the back seat of his car, and
gave him a ride home, pumping him all the time for information on
where one might find a little weed. Art didn't tell him anything.
</p>

<p>Art finally got home, propped the soaked mattress up against
the wall in the bedroom, and went to sleep, exhausted, on the
linoleum floor again. An hour after he fell asleep, the mattress
fell over on him and, because the room was so narrow and the
mattress was so wet and heavy, it wedged him in so tight he
couldn't get out until his friend John came looking for him the
next day. </p>

<hr>

<h3>Burglarizing His Own Apartment </h3>

<p>Times were undeniably tough for Art, and the exhaustion of
having to deal with the cops on an almost daily basis didn't help
matters. A couple of times he did manage to get jobs, only to be
let go when it became obvious to his employers that Art was a
center of attention for the police. </p>

<p>But he managed to get by for quite a while doing odd jobs here
and there, eating next to nothing, and wearing the same old
threadbare clothes. Then one day the rent was due and his
landlord came to the door. Art explained that he was about to go
a job interview and then would pick up the rent money from his
parents and, if the landlord would kindly wait a little bit, Art
would surely have the money for him. It was a partial story - his
parents didn't have the money, either, but he did have a job
interview - but Art was just trying to buy a little time to keep
his life together. The landlord seemed to accept the story and
Art thought everything was fine. </p>

<p>Art started to get cleaned up for his job interview and, after
taking a shower, put on his pants and went down to the mailbox to
check the mail. By the time he got back, there was a padlock on
the door. He pleaded with the landlord but the landlord also knew
by now that Art was of special interest to the cops, so the
landlord had no incentive to give Art even the tiniest break. Art
went out and sat in the middle of a field, with nothing on but
his pants, to think. </p>

<p>By and by it got dark and Art figured he would sneak back in
to get the rest of his possessions which amounted to a belt, a
couple of shirts, an old pair of shoes, three or four pieces of
raggedy underwear, and the mattress, which he decided not to try
to deal with again, because it had become extremely moldy from
the earlier soaking in the rain. Getting in to his place was
easy. He just popped in through a side window. He was inside no
more than two or three minutes. </p>

<p>When he popped his head out the window a deputy sheriff's
flashlight shone squarely in his face. The landlord had alerted
them hours before and they were waiting for him. Due to his
previous criminal record, he wound up doing about another six
months on that one. </p>

<hr>

<h3>The Marijuana That Wasn't His. </h3>

<p>When Art got out of jail he went back to college and tried to
make a go of it again. The only regular income he could find was
from selling small amounts of marijuana and other drugs. He had
some fairly good drug connections from his various times in jail,
but we was more honest and friendly than he was shrewd so he
never did much more than a few small sales to eke out an
existence. </p>

<p>As luck would have it Art ran into a bright young business
executive who was just starting out with a new wife and baby and,
having put a little money aside, decided to dabble in the
marijuana trading market. Somehow, he managed to get his hands on
thirty pounds of weed and then started looking around to sell it.
He didn't know anyone himself who was interested in thirty pounds
of weed but eventually he ran into Art and mentioned that he
would pay Art a commission of one hundred dollars and a small bag
of personal stash if Art could introduce him to someone who would
buy it. Art knew lots of people and one hundred dollars was a lot
of money to Art, so he looked around until he found someone. </p>

<p>Art introduced the two parties to the transaction and waited
patiently for them to conclude their business so he could get his
commission and leave. In the middle of the transaction, car
lights went on and car motors started in the neighborhood around
them. In a matter of a few moments, they were surrounded by
Sacramento sheriff's deputies. The buyer he found turned out to
be a snitch. </p>

<p>To summarize the legal proceedings which followed, the guy who
actually owned the weed pleaded that he was really a good citizen
who made a mistake, he had a wife and baby, etc., etc., He walked
out with probation, with an agreement to testify against Art. </p>

<p>The snitch, who had previously been busted, got his previous
charges dropped with an agreement to testify against Art. </p>

<p>Art was charged with possession for sale of the entire thirty
pounds. That brings us to the lawyer. </p>

<hr>

<h3>And Now, The Lawyer </h3>

<p>Art's lawyer advised him that, in view of all the previous
convictions, and a long string of nuisance violations (which
should have been self-evident police harassment), this time Art
was destined to do some serious time in prison unless some sort
of miracle happened. Art's lawyer suggested that the only way out
was for Art to turn someone else in - turn snitch. </p>

<p>&quot;Snitches get killed.&quot; Art said. &quot;What else can
I do?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Maybe they would let you off if you had a job and could
show that you were trying to be an honest citizen,&quot; his
lawyer suggested. </p>

<p>Art promptly went out and got an absolutely grinding job
several miles from home. It was a massive struggle just to keep
up with the job, but he did it. Then he went back to his lawyer. </p>

<p>&quot;No dice,&quot; his lawyer told him. &quot;You are going
to have to do something else.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Like what?&quot; Art asked. </p>

<p>&quot;You could always snitch someone off,&quot; his lawyer
suggested. </p>

<p>&quot;Snitches get killed,&quot; Art said. &quot;I don't want
to get killed. What else can I do?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Hmmm,&quot; his lawyer said, &quot;maybe you should get
married to show them that you are trying to settle down.&quot; </p>

<p>Art looked up an old high school girlfriend, explained the
situation to her and she agreed to get married. She had a fairly
decent job and they were able to move into a good apartment on
her income. After the wedding, he went back to his lawyer. </p>

<p>&quot;Still not cutting it,&quot; his lawyer told him.
&quot;You are going to have to do something else.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Like what?&quot; Art asked. </p>

<p>&quot;You could always snitch someone off,&quot; his lawyer
suggested. </p>

<p>&quot;Snitches get killed,&quot; Art said. &quot;I don't want
to get killed. What else can I do?&quot; </p>

<p>His lawyer thought it over again. &quot;Maybe if you had a
baby on the way. Babies always get sympathy.&quot; </p>

<p>Art promptly went out and got his bride pregnant. When she was
beginning to show, he went back to his lawyer. </p>

<p>&quot;Closer. I had them going for a while with the baby
story, but it is still not enough,&quot; his lawyer clucked.
&quot;You're going to have to do something more.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Like what?&quot; Art asked. </p>

<p>&quot;You could always snitch someone off,&quot; his lawyer
suggested. </p>

<p>&quot;Snitches get killed,&quot; Art said. &quot;I don't want
to get killed. What else can I do?&quot; </p>

<p>His lawyer thought and thought again and finally said,
&quot;They might cut you some slack if you were a heroin addict
and claimed that what you were out of control because of your
addiction and what you really need is rehabilitation. If you did
that, I might be able to get you out with a year or so in a
hospital.&quot; </p>

<p>Art had never taken heroin in his life, but it was hard to
turn down that kind of opportunity to avoid a long stretch in
prison. He developed a good-sized heroin habit, went through a
couple of really good withdrawal episodes in front of doctors who
could testify that he really was addicted, and then went back to
his lawyer. </p>

<p>&quot;We almost had them there,&quot; his lawyer said,
&quot;but it still wasn't quite enough. You are going to have to
do something else.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Like what?&quot; Art asked. </p>

<p>&quot;You could always snitch someone off,&quot; his lawyer
suggested. </p>

<p>&quot;Snitches get killed,&quot; Art said. &quot;I don't want
to get killed. What else can I do?&quot; </p>

<p>By that time, both Art and his lawyer had run out of ideas.
Art was now working, married with a baby on the way, and a pretty
good heroin habit, all on the advice of his lawyer. Art became
resigned to the fact that, in order to avoid spending the rest of
his life in jail, he was going to have to snitch someone off. </p>

<p>The sheriffs really enjoyed Art's company as a snitch. They
rounded up several people before the word got out about Art and
it wasn't long before there were rumors floating the streets that
Art would not be long for this world if he hung around
Sacramento. </p>

<p>But, it seemed to work. For the first time since he had been
busted for the thirty pounds of pot which wasn't his, it began to
look like they were going to let him off the hook - until the
next time, at least. </p>

<p>Then, a week before his case was due to come its final
resolution, his lawyer was busted for income tax evasion and had
to drop out of the case. Art got a public defender who knew
nothing about the case and believed the sheriff's deputies when
they gleefully told him that there had been no deal with Art at
all. Art went to prison, full sentence for the full thirty
pounds, a multiple felony offender besides, and remains there
today. He spends most of his time alone in protective custody
because of the death threats against him. </p>

<h1>The Lower East Side Needle Exchange T-Shirt</h1>

<p><b>(my naive attempt to relate to a heroin user as if he were
a normal person)</b> </p>

<p><b>by Bob Ramsey (rmz@computek.net)</b> </p>

<hr>

<p>In Mid-November, I attended the 8th International Conference
on Drug Policy Reform at a hotel in Washington, D.C. On the last
evening I was walking past the propaganda table at the main
ballroom and passed this guy ambling the other way. He was
wearing a leather jacket that was unzipped revealing his black
T-shirt with white letters in a nifty graphic saying &quot;Lower
East Side Needle Exchange&quot;. We passed without greeting and
after about 5 steps I thought &quot;I want one of those
T-shirts&quot;. After 5 more steps I thought &quot;maybe he knows
where I could get one&quot;... 5 more and &quot;I'll never find
out if I don't ask him now&quot;. I turned and scurried around
the corner where he had just disappeared. </p>

<p>There were just the two of us in the 50 yard walkway alongside
the ballrooms... &quot;Excuse me, sir... excuse me... hey,
where'd you get that T-shirt? Can I get one?&quot; </p>

<p>He stopped and turned methodically. &quot;Well yeah, man,
we're selling them for 10 bucks&quot;. </p>

<p>&quot;Do you have any in extra large?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;No. All we got left is large. Do you think you could get
by with... No, I guess you need an extra large. I could send you
one when we get back to New York.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;How much would it be with shipping and handling?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Well gee, I dunno... I guess it would be less than
$20&quot;. </p>

<p>&quot;I suppose it would! How about 15?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I guess that'd prob'ly do it. But hey, maybe my boss has
an extra large left. We could walk around and check.&quot; </p>

<p>We exchanged pleasantries as we walked back around past the
conference entrance where I had first seen him. He found that I
was from outside of Dallas and asked if they have a needle
exchange there, but I didn't know. When we came to the small
meeting room on the other side he went in. The meeting was just
breaking up and people started filing out, some leaving, some
forming small groups in the hallway. He came out with four or six
people kind of dressed like him who assembled by the windows as
he came back over to me. &quot;I'm sorry, man, we're out of extra
large, but if you give me $15, I'll mail you one right when I get
home.&quot; </p>

<p>I didn't have correct change, but after some fumbling and
discussions with passers-by, I ended up giving him a twenty and a
five, and he gave me a ten. </p>

<p>&quot;I don't have any cards left&quot;, I said, &quot;do you
have some place I can write down my address?&quot; </p>

<p>He rifled through his stack of leaflets and handed me a light
blue half-sheet that was blank on the back. I sat on the bench
along the wall to write my address, but found that my pencil
didn't show up well on the blue paper. </p>

<p>&quot;Do you have a pen?&quot; I asked. </p>

<p>&quot;Sure!&quot; he said, and he handed me a syringe. The
part you push on with your thumb was in the &quot;out&quot;
position, and the glass tube was filled with a reddish
translucent liquid that I suppose was intended to represent a
mixture of blood and heroin. At the end where the needle would be
was a ball-point pen. </p>

<p>&quot;Well!&quot; I said. &quot;I've never seen anything quite
like this! Do you have any more of these?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;No, man, that's from a needle exchange across town. We
just have the T-shirts.&quot; </p>

<p>Sitting there on the bench, I wrote down &quot;X-Large&quot;
and my address and handed it up to the disheveled gentleman in
black. As he leaned over to retrieve his pen, his dark wavy hair
fell alongside his face and I was hit with a strong gust of
mysterious aromas punctuated by tobacco. </p>

<p>&quot;Thanks, man. We appreciate it. I'll send you some
literature, too.&quot; </p>

<p>As he hurried off to join his comrades, he turned and waved.
&quot;Thanks again, it's for a good cause.&quot; </p>

<hr>

<p>When I got back to the office on Monday, I was a big hit with
my tales about the drug law conference and the literature I
brought back. Everyone gathered around to read &quot;Prison
Life&quot; monthly, with its advice column &quot;Ask Bubba&quot;.
Bubba dished up sage advice on such topics as &quot;My celly
snores&quot;, and &quot;I've got this thing for Hillary Clinton,
what should I do?&quot; </p>

<p>And you can imagine the mirth and merriment when I told them
about the Lower East Side Needle Exchange T-Shirt: &quot;You mean
to tell me you gave fifteen dollars CASH to a guy in a T-shirt
saying &quot;Lower East Side Needle Exchange?!!!&quot;, and
&quot;Just what was that 'good cause'?&quot; I had to agree it
was a good joke, even if it was at my expense. But I decided it
was an excellent value. For the humble sum of $15, I had bought a
ticket to the Greatest Show on Earth, a show that would last
several days at least: </p>

<p>Would I get my T-shirt, and if so, when? I thought about
starting an office pool, but nobody wanted to bet me. After all,
they felt sorry that I was already out 15 bucks. And what kind of
odds could I get? And how long is too long? </p>

<p>The T-shirt became a test of stereotypes about drug users.
Everyone assumed this guy must be into heroin and the money would
necessarily disappear. </p>

<p>So the question becomes: </p>

<p>Is it possible for a heroin user to behave responsibly? Can a
junkie carry $15 in cash from Washington to New York and render
perceived value to a faraway stranger known only by a scawled
address on a scrap of paper? Or would he need the money for
something more important? </p>

<p>That night I slept well, but awoke an hour or two early,
thinking about my interest in changing our drug laws. Injuring
people to protect them from themselves... The problem seems to
get bigger the more resources we throw at it... Would
civilization grind to a halt if we let consumers consume what
they want? Would a foreign enemy conquer us? Is the right to
remain silent the only right we have left? Do we have the right
to? Do we have the right not to? What is right? About here God
kicks in. I have had some prayers answered in my day. I'm not
very good at praying, but I've heard God only cares about
sincerity, so I went ahead, and it went something like this: </p>

<p>Dear Lord, If it be thy will, hear my prayer. I'm just a
white-bread white-boy, what don't know nothing about the evils of
heroin. I believe our laws are causing these problems, but now
I'm not so sure. I've been working on this social issue with the
goal of letting half a million people out of jail... a course of
action that would stifle the growth of America's prison industry
that has such high hopes of taking up the slack where the
military is laying off... that would make tens of thousands of
government employees rethink their career plans... </p>

<p>Give me a sign, Lord. Is prohibition a vain attempt to plug
some safety valves you installed in our souls? Can a junkie wrap
up a T-shirt and lick a stamp? I need to know if what I'm doing
is right. Either way it comes out, I promise to submit the facts
to a candid world like it says in the Declaration of
Independence. And if you really want to make it a sign, then
bless the postman's fingers and grant him Godspeed. In Jesus'
name I pr.... </p>

<p>No, that would be cheating. If it be THY will, Lord. Let's
leave Jesus out of this... Well... Jesus, if you WANT to get
involved in this, feel free. Thy will is pretty important too.
And God, if you REALLY want to make it a sign, you can put
crosses on the package or something really over-the-top that I
wouldn't even think of and..... </p>

<p>As my prayer further deteriorated into meandering brain cells
firing in the night, I closed it out and went back to sleep. </p>

<p>In the following days, I thought about the test I had
proposed. The U.S. Postal Service, or U.P.S. or whoever, didn't
break any delivery speed records, and the T-shirt didn't show up
as we were saying Grace before Thanksgiving dinner. But Time-Life
wants 4-6 weeks to send out a CD. Andwhether it shows up or not,
what is proved by a statistical sample of one? </p>

<p>I can't even send a letter to my mother- why should I expect a
nameless junkie on the Lower East Side to send me something that
costs money? A woman at work predicted I would get the T-shirt
&quot;about March. He'll lose the address and find it later.
He'll think that's soon. Those people don't think about time like
we do.&quot; </p>

<p>At the office the joking has died down, but now and again we
find someone who hasn't heard about the Lower East Side Needle
Exchange T-Shirt and it's good for another laugh. Whether I get
the shirt or not, that fifteen dollars is still providing value,
so I suppose it's way up there on the list of the best money I
ever spent. Still, there are a couple of reasons I'm hoping that
guy can get his act together. One is a positive answer to this
momentous question. The other is- I want one of those T-shirts. </p>

<h1>Advice To Little Girls </h1>

<p><b>By Mark Twain, 1865</b> </p>

<hr>

<p>Good little girls ought not to make mouths at their teachers
for every trifling offense. This retaliation should only be
resorted to under peculiarly aggravated circumstances. </p>

<p>If you have nothing but a rag-doll stuffed with sawdust, while
one of your more fortunate little playmates has a costly China
one, you should treat her with a show of kindness nevertheless.
And you ought not to attempt to make a forcible swap with her
unless your conscience would justify you in it, and you know you
are able to do it. </p>

<p>You ought never to take your little brother's
&quot;chewing-gum&quot; away from him by main force; it is better
to rope him in with the promise of the first two dollars and a
half you find floating down the river on a grindstone. In the
artless simplicity natural to his time of life, he will regard it
as a perfectly fair transaction. In all ages of the world this
eminently plausible fiction has lured the obtuse infant to
financial ruin and disaster. </p>

<p>If at any time you find it necessary to correct your brother,
do not correct him with mud - never, on any account, throw mud at
him, because it will spoil his clothes. It is better to scald him
a little, for then you obtain desirable results. You secure his
immediate attention to the lessons you are inculcating, and at
the same time your hot water will have a tendency to move
impurities from his person, and possibly the skin, in spots. </p>

<p>If your mother tells you to do a thing, it is wrong to reply
that you won't. It is better and more becoming to intimate that
you will do as she bids you, and then afterward act quietly in
the manner according to the dictates of your best judgment. </p>

<p>You should ever bear in mind that it is to your kind parents
that you are indebted for your food, and your nice bed, and for
your beautiful clothes, and for the privilege of staying home
from school when you let on that you are sick. Therefore you
ought to respect their little prejudices, and humor their little
whims, and put up with their little foibles until they get to
crowding you too much. </p>

<p>Good little girls always show marked deference for the aged.
You ought never to &quot;sass&quot; old people unless they
&quot;sass&quot; you first.</p>

<h1>The Story Of The Bad Little Boy </h1>

<p><b>By Mark Twain, 1875</b> </p>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Once there was a bad little boy whose name was Jim - though,
if you will notice, you will find that bad little boys are nearly
always called James in your Sunday-school books. It was strange,
but still it was true that this one was called Jim. </p>

<p>He didn't have any sick mother either - a sick mother who was
pious and had the consumption, and would be glad to lie down in
the grave and be at rest but for the strong love she bore her
boy, and the anxiety she felt that the world might be harsh and
cold towards him when she was gone. Most bad boys in the
Sunday-books are named James, and have sick mothers, who teach
them to say, &quot;Now, I lay me down,&quot; etc. and sing them
to sleep with sweet, plaintive voices, and then kiss them
good-night, and kneel down by the bedside and weep. But it was
different with this fellow. He was named Jim, and there wasn't
anything the matter with his mother - no consumption, nor
anything of that kind. She was rather stout than otherwise, and
she was not pious; moreover, she was not anxious on Jim's
account. She said if he were to break his neck it wouldn't be
much loss. She always spanked Jim to sleep, and she never kissed
him good-night; on the contrary, she boxed his ears when she was
ready to leave him. </p>

<p>Once this little bad boy stole the key of the pantry, and
slipped in there and helped himself to some jam, and filled up
the vessel with tar, so that his mother would never know the
difference; but all at once a terrible feeling didn't come over
him, and something didn't seem to whisper to him, &quot;Is it
right to disobey my mother? Isn't it sinful to do this? Where do
bad little boys go who gobble up their good kind mother's
jam?&quot; and then he didn't kneel down all alone and promise
never to be wicked any more, and rise up with a light, happy
heart, and go and tell his mother all about it, and beg her
forgiveness, and be blessed by her with tears of pride and
thankfulness in her eyes. No; that is the way with all other bad
boys in the books; but it happened otherwise with this Jim,
strangely enough. He ate that jam, and said it was bully, in his
sinful, vulgar way; and he put in the tar, and said that was
bully also, and laughed, and observed &quot;that the old woman
would get up and snort&quot; when she found it out; and when she
did find it out, he denied knowing anything about it, and she
whipped him severely, and he did the crying himself. Everything
about this boy was curious - everything turned out differently
with him from the way it does to the bad James in the books. </p>

<p>Once he climbed up in Farmer Acorn's apple-tree to steal
apples, and the limb didn't break, and he didn't fall and break
his arm, and get torn by the farmer's great dog, and then
languish on a sick bed for weeks, and repent and become good. Oh!
no; he stole as many apples as he wanted and came down all right;
and he was all ready for the dog too, and knocked him endways
with a brick when he came to tear him. It was very strange -
nothing like it ever happened in those mild little books with
marbled backs, and with pictures in them of men with
swallow-tailed coats and bell-crowned hats, and pantaloons that
are short in the legs, and women with the waists of their dresses
under their arms, and no hoops on. Nothing like it in any of the
Sunday-school books. </p>

<p>Once he stole the teacher's pen-knife, and, when he was afraid
it would be found out and he would get whipped, he slipped it
into George Wilson's cap - poor Widow Wilson's son, the moral
boy, the good little boy of the village, who always obeyed his
mother, and never told an untruth, and was fond of his lessons,
and infatuated with Sunday-school. And when the knife dropped
from the cap, and poor George hung his head and blushed, as if in
conscious guilt, and the grieved teacher charged the theft upon
him, and was just in the very act of bringing the switch down
upon his trembling shoulders, a white-haired improbable justice
of the peace did not suddenly appear in their midst, and strike
an attitude and say, &quot;Spare this noble boy - there stands
the cowering culprit! I was passing the school-door at recess,
and unseen myself, I saw the theft committed!&quot; And then Jim
didn't get whaled, and the venerable justice didn't read the
tearful school a homily and take George by the hand and say such
a boy deserved to be exalted, and then tell him to come and make
his home with him, and sweep out the office, and make fires, and
run errands, and chop wood, and study law, and help his wife to
do household labors, and have all the balance of the time to
play, and get forty cents a month, and be happy. No; it would
have happened that way in the books, but it didn't happen that
way to Jim. No meddling old clam of a justice dropped in to make
trouble, and so the model boy George got thrashed, and Jim was
glad of it because, you know, Jim hated moral boys. Jim said he
was &quot;down on them milk-sops.&quot; Such was the coarse
language of this bad, neglected boy. </p>

<p>But the strangest thing that ever happened to Jim was the time
he went boating on Sunday, and didn't get drowned, and that other
time that he got caught out in the storm when he was fishing on
Sunday, and didn't get struck by lighting. Why, you might look,
and look, all through the Sunday-school books from now till next
Christmas, and you would never come across anything like this. Oh
no; you would find that all the bad boys who go boating on Sunday
invariably get drowned; and all the bad boys who get caught out
in storms when they are fishing on Sunday infallibly get struck
by lightning. Boats with bad boys in them always upset on Sunday,
and it always storms when bad boys go fishing on the Sabbath. How
this Jim ever escaped is a mystery to me. </p>

<p>This Jim bore a charmed life - that must have been the way of
it. Nothing could hurt him. He even gave the elephant in the
menagerie a plug of tobacco, and the elephant didn't knock the
top of his head off with his trunk. He browsed around the
cupboard after essence of peppermint, and didn't make a mistake
and drink aqua fortis. He stole his father's gun and went hunting
on the Sabbath, and didn't shoot three or four of his fingers
off. He struck his little sister on the temple with his fist when
he was angry, and she didn't linger in pain through long summer
days, and die with sweet words of forgiveness upon her lips that
redoubled the anguish of his breaking heart. No; she got over it.
He ran off and went to sea at last, and didn't come back and find
himself sad and alone in the world, his loved ones sleeping in
the quiet churchyard, and the vine-embowered home of his boyhood
tumbled down and gone to decay. Ah! no; he came home as drunk as
a piper, and got into the station-house the first thing. </p>

<p>And he grew up and married, and raised a large family, and
brained them all with an axe one night, and got wealthy by all
manner of cheating and rascality; and now he is the infernalist
wickedest scoundrel in his native village, and is universally
respected, and belongs to the Legislature. </p>

<p>So you see there never was a bad James in the Sunday-school
books that had such a streak of luck as this sinful Jim with the
charmed life.<br>

<p>The Story Of The Good Little Boy </p>

<p><b>By Mark Twain, 1875</b> </p>

<hr>

<p>Once there was a good little boy by the name of Jacob Blivens.
He always obeyed his parents, no matter how absurd and
unreasonable their demands were; and he always learned his book,
and never was late at Sabbath-school. He would not play hookey,
even when his sober judgment told him it was the most profitable
thing he could do. None of the other boys could ever make that
boy out, he acted so strangely. He wouldn't lie, no matter how
convenient it was. He just said it was wrong to lie, and that was
sufficient for him. And he was so honest that he was simply
ridiculous. The curious ways that that Jacob had, surpassed
everything. He wouldn't play marbles on Sunday, he wouldn't rob
birds' nests, he wouldn't give hot pennies to organ-grinders'
monkeys; he didn't seem to take any interest in any kind of
rational amusement. So the other boys used to try to reason it
out and come to an understanding of him, but they couldn't arrive
at any satisfactory conclusion. As I said before, they could only
figure out a sort of vague idea that he was
&quot;afflicted,&quot; and so they took him under their
protection, and never allowed any harm to come to him. </p>

<p>This good little boy read all the Sunday-school books; they
were his greatest delight. This was the whole secret of it. He
believed in the good little boys they put in the Sunday-school
books; he had every confidence in them. He longed to come across
one of them alive, once; but he never did. They all died before
his time, maybe. Whenever he read about a particularly good one
he turned over quickly to the end to see what became of him,
because he wanted to travel thousands of miles and gaze on him;
but it wasn't any use; that good little boy always died in the
last chapter, and there was a picture of the funeral, with all
his relatives and the Sunday-school children standing around the
grave in pantaloons that were too short, and bonnets that were
too large, and everybody crying into handkerchiefs that had as
much as a yard and a half of stuff in them. He was always headed
off in this way. He never could see one of those good little boys
on account of his always dying in the last chapter. </p>

<p>Jacob had a noble ambition to be put in a Sunday-school book.
He wanted to be put in, with pictures representing him gloriously
declining to lie to his mother, and her weeping for joy about it;
and pictures representing him standing on the doorstep giving a
penny to a poor beggar-woman with six children, and telling her
to spend it freely, but not to be extravagant, because
extravagance is a sin; and pictures of him magnanimously refusing
to tell on the bad boy who always lay in wait for him around the
corner as he came from school, and welted him over the head with
a lath, and then chased him home, saying, &quot;Hi! hi!&quot; as
he proceeded. This was the ambition of young Jacob Blivens. He
wished to be put in a Sunday-school book. It made him feel a
little uncomfortable sometimes when he reflected that the good
little boys always died. He loved to live, you know, and this was
the most unpleasant feature about being a Sunday-school-book boy.
He knew it was not healthy to be good. He knew it was more fatal
than consumption to be so supernaturally good as the boys in the
books were; he knew that none of them had been able to stand it
long, and it pained him to think that if they put him in a book
he wouldn't ever see it, or even if they did get the book out
before he died it wouldn't be popular without any picture of his
funeral in the back part of it. It couldn't be much of a
Sunday-school book that couldn't tell about the advice he gave to
the community when he was dying. So at last, of course, he had to
make up his mind to do the best he could under the circumstances
- to live right, and hang on as long as he could, and have his
dying speech all ready when his time came. </p>

<p>But somehow nothing ever went right with this good little boy;
nothing ever turned out with him the way it turned out with the
good little boys in the books. They always had a good time, and
the bad boys had the broken legs; but in his case there was a
screw loose somewhere; and it all happened just the other way.
When he found Jim Blake stealing apples, and went under the tree
to read to him about the bad little boy who fell out of a
neighbor's apple-tree and broke his arm, Jim fell out of the tree
too, but he fell on him, and broke his arm, and Jim wasn't hurt
at all. Jacob couldn't understand that. There wasn't anything in
the books like it. </p>

<p>And once, when some bad boys pushed a blind man over in the
mud, and Jacob ran to help him up and receive his blessing, the
blind man did not give him any blessing at all, but whacked him
over the head with his stick and said he would like to catch him
shoving him again, and then pretending to help him up. This was
not in accordance with any of the books. Jacob looked them all
over to see. </p>

<p>One thing that Jacob wanted to do was to find a lame dog that
hadn't any place to stay, and was hungry and persecuted, and
bring him home and pet him and have that dog's imperishable
gratitude. And at last he found one and was happy; and he brought
him home and fed him, but when he was going to pet him the dog
flew at him and tore all the clothes off him except those that
were in front, and made a spectacle of him that was astonishing.
He examined authorities, but he could not understand the matter.
It was of the same breed of dogs that was in the books, but it
acted very differently. Whatever this boy did he got into
trouble. The very things the boys in the books got rewarded for
turned out to be about the most unprofitable things he could
invest in. </p>

<p>Once, when he was on his way to Sunday-school, he saw some bad
boys starting off pleasuring in a sailboat. He was filled with
consternation, because he knew from his reading that boys who
went sailing on Sunday invariably got drowned. So he ran out on a
raft to warn them, but a log turned with him and slid him into
the river. A man got him out pretty soon, and the doctor pumped
the water out of him, and gave him a fresh start with his
bellows, but he caught cold and lay sick a-bed nine weeks. But
the most unaccountable thing about it was that the bad boys in
the boat had a good time all day, and then reached home alive and
well in the most surprising manner. Jacob Blivens said there was
nothing like these things in the books. He was perfectly
dumb-founded. </p>

<p>When he got well he was a little discouraged, but he resolved
to keep on trying anyhow. He knew that so far his experience
wouldn't do to go in a book, but he hadn't yet reached the
allotted term of life for good little boys, and he hoped to be
able to make a record yet if he could hold on till his time was
fully up. If everything else failed he had his dying speech to
fall back on. </p>

<p>He examined his authorities, and found that it was now time
for him to go to sea as a cabin-boy. He called on a ship captain
and made his application, and when the captain asked for his
recommendations he proudly drew out a tract and pointed to the
words. &quot;To Jacob Blivens, from his affectionate
teacher.&quot; But the captain was a coarse, vulgar man, and he
said, &quot;Oh, that be blowed! that wasn't any proof that he
know how to wash dishes or handle a slush-bucket, and he guessed
he didn't want him.&quot; This was altogether the most
extraordinary thing that ever happened to Jacob in all his life.
A compliment from a teacher, on a tract, had never failed to move
the tenderest emotions of ship captains, and open the way to all
offices of honor and profit in their gift - it never had in any
book that ever he had read. He could hardly believe his senses. </p>

<p>This boy always had a hard time of it. Nothing over came out
according to the authorities with him. At last, one day, when he
was around hunting up bad little boys to admonish, he found a lot
of them in the old iron foundry fixing up a little joke on
fourteen or fifteen dogs, which they had tied together in long
procession, and were going to ornament with empty nitro-glycerine
cans made fast to their tails. Jacob's heart was touched. He sat
down on one of those cans (for he never minded grease when duty
was before him), and he took hold of the foremost dog by the
collar, and turned his reproving eye upon wicked Tom Jones. But
just at that moment Alderman McWelter full of wrath, stepped in.
All the bad boys ran away, but Jacob Blivens rose in conscious
innocence and began one of those stately little
Sunday-school-book speeches which always commence with &quot;Oh,
sir!&quot; in dead opposition to the fact that no boy, good or
bad, ever starts a remark with &quot;Oh, sir.&quot; But the
alderman never waited to hear the rest. He took Jacob Blivens by
the ear and turned him around, and hit him a whack in the rear
with the flat of his hand; and in an instant that good little boy
shot out through the roof and soared away towards the sun, with
the fragments of those fifteen dogs stringing after him like the
tail of a kite. And there wasn't a sign of that alderman or that
old iron foundry left on the face of the earth; and, as for young
Jacob Blivens, he never got a chance to make his last dying
speech after all his trouble fixing it up, unless he made it to
the birds; because, although the bulk of him came down all right
in a tree-top in an adjoining county, the rest of him was
apportioned around among four townships, and so they had to hold
five inquests on him to find out whether he was dead or not, and
how it occurred. You never saw a boy scattered so. ^* </p>

<p>[Footnote *: This glycerine catastrophe is borrowed from a
floating newspaper item, whose author's name I would give if I
knew it. - [M.T.]] </p>

<p>Thus perished the good little boy who did the best he could,
but didn't come out according to the books. Every boy who ever
did as he did prospered except him. His case is truly remarkable.
It will probably never be accounted for.<br>

<h1>The Danger Of Lying In Bed </h1>

<p><b>By Mark Twain</b> </p>

<p><b>1871</b> </p>

<hr>

<p>The man in the ticket-office said: </p>

<p>&quot;Have an accident insurance ticket, also?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; I said, after studying the matter over a
little. &quot;No, I believe not; I am going to be travelling by
rail all day to-day. However, to-morrow I don't travel. Give me
one for to-morrow.&quot; </p>

<p>The man looked puzzled. He said: </p>

<p>&quot;But it is for accident insurance, and if you are going
to travel by rail - &quot; </p>

<p>&quot;If I am going to travel by rail I sha'n't need it. Lying
at home in bed is the thing I am afraid of.&quot; </p>

<p>I had been looking into this matter. Last year I traveled
twenty thousand miles, almost entirely by rail; the year before,
I traveled over twenty-five thousand miles, half by sea and half
by rail; and the year before that I traveled in the neighborhood
of ten thousand miles, exclusively by rail. I suppose if I put in
all the little odd journeys here and there, I may say I have
traveled sixty thousand miles during the three years I have
mentioned. And never an accident. </p>

<p>For a good while I said to myself every morning: &quot;Now I
have escaped thus far, and so the chances are just that much
increased that I shall catch it this time. I will be shrewd, and
buy an accident ticket.&quot; And to a dead moral certainty I
drew a blank, and went to bed that night without a joint started
or a bone splintered. I got tired of that sort of daily bother,
and fell to buying accident tickets that were good for a month. I
said to myself, &quot;A man can't buy thirty blanks in one
bundle.&quot; </p>

<p>But I was mistaken. There was never a prize in the lot. I
could read of railway accidents every day - the newspaper
atmosphere was foggy with them; but somehow they never came my
way. I found I had spent a good deal of money in the accident
business, and had nothing to show for it. My suspicions were
aroused, and I began to hunt around for somebody that had won in
this lottery. I found plenty of people who had invested, but not
an individual that had ever had an accident or made a cent. I
stopped buying accident tickets and went to ciphering. The result
was astounding. The peril lay not in traveling, but in staying at
home. </p>

<p>I hunted up statistics, and was amazed to find that after all
the glaring newspaper headings concerning railroad disasters,
less than three hundred people had really lost their lives by
those disasters in the preceding twelve months. The Erie road was
set down as the most murderous in the list. It had killed
forty-six - or twenty-six, I do not exactly remember which, but I
know the number was double that of any other road. But the fact
straightway suggested itself that the Erie was an immensely long
road, and did more business than any other line in the country;
so the double number of killed ceased to be matter for surprise. </p>

<p>By further figuring, it appeared that between New York and
Rochester the Erie ran eight passenger-trains each way every day
- 16 altogether; and carried a daily average of 6,000 persons.
That is about a million in six months - the population of New
York City. Well, the Erie kills from 13 to 23 persons out of its
million in six months; and in the same time 13,000 of New York's
million die in their beds! My flesh crept, my hair stood on end.
&quot;This is appalling!&quot; I said. &quot;The danger isn't in
traveling by rail, but in trusting to those deadly beds. I will
never sleep in a bed again.&quot; </p>

<p>I had figured on considerably less than one-half the length of
the Erie road. It was plain that the entire road must transport
at least eleven or twelve thousand people every day. There are
many short roads running out of Boston that do fully half as
much; a great many such roads. There are many roads scattered
about the Union that do a prodigious passenger business.
Therefore it was fair to presume that an average of 2,500
passengers a day for each road in the country would be about
correct. There are 846 railway lines in our country, and 846
times 2,500 are 2,115,000. So the railways of America move more
than two millions of people every day; six hundred and fifty
millions of people a year, without counting the Sundays. They do
that, too - there is no question about it; though where they get
the raw material is clear beyond the jurisdiction of my
arithmetic; for I have hunted the census through and through, and
I find that there are not that many people in the United States,
by a matter of six hundred and ten millions at the very least.
They must use some of the same people over again, likely. </p>

<p>San Francisco is one-eighth as populous as New York; there are
60 deaths a week in the former and 500 a week in the latter - if
they have luck. That is 3,120 deaths a year in San Francisco, and
eight times as many in New York - say about 25,000 or 26,000. The
health of the two places is the same. So we will let it stand as
a fair presumption that this will hold good all over the country,
and that consequently 25,000 out of every million of people we
have must die every year. That amounts to one-fortieth of our
total population. One million of us, then, die annually. Out of
this million ten or twelve thousand are stabbed, shot, drowned,
hanged, poisoned, or meet a similarly violent death in some other
popular way, such as perishing by kerosene-lamp and hoop-skirt
conflagrations, getting buried in coal-mines, falling off
house-tops, breaking through church or lecture-room floors,
taking patent medicines, or committing suicide in other forms.
The Erie railroad kills from 23 to 46; the other 845 railroads
kill an average of one-third of a man each; and the rest of that
million, amounting in the aggregate to the appalling figure of
987,631 corpses, die naturally in their beds! </p>

<p>You will excuse me from taking any more chances on those beds.
The railroads are good enough for me. </p>

<p>And my advice to all people is, Don't stay at home any more
than you can help; but when you have got to stay at home a while,
buy a package of those insurance tickets and sit up nights. You
cannot be too cautious. </p>

<p>[One can see now why I answered that ticket-agent in the
manner recorded at the top of this sketch.] </p>

<p>The moral of this composition is, that thoughtless people
grumble more than is fair about railroad management in the United
States. When we consider that every day and night of the year
full fourteen thousand railway-trains of various kinds, freighted
with life and armed with death, go thundering over the land, the
marvel is, not that they kill three hundred human beings in a
twelvemonth, but that they do not kill three hundred times three
hundred!<br>

<h1>Accident Insurance - Etc. </h1>

<p> <b>By Mark Twain</b> </p>

<p> <img src="../GRAPHICS/blueline.gif"><br>
</p>

<p> <b>Delivered In Hartford, At A Dinner To Cornelius Walford,
Of London, 1875</b> </p>

<p> Gentlemen, - I am glad, indeed, to assist in welcoming the
distinguished guest of this occasion to a city whose fame as an
insurance centre has extended to all lands, and given us the name
of being a quadruple band of brothers working sweetly hand in
hand - the Colt's arms company making the destruction of our race
easy and convenient, our life-insurance citizens paying for the
victims when they pass away, Mr. Batterson perpetuating their
memory with his stately monuments, and our fire-insurance
comrades taking care of their hereafter. I am glad to assist in
welcoming our guest - first, because he is an Englishman, and I
owe a heavy debt of hospitality to certain of his
fellow-countrymen; and secondly, because he is in sympathy with
insurance, and has been the means of making many other men cast
their sympathies in the same direction. </p>

<p> Certainly there is no nobler field for human effort than the
insurance line of business - especially accident insurance. Ever
since I have been a director in an accident-insurance company I
have felt that I am a better man. Life has seemed more precious.
Accidents have assumed a kindlier aspect. Distressing special
providences have lost half their horror. I look upon a cripple
now with affectionate interest - as an advertisement. I do not
seem to care for poetry any more. I do not care for politics even
agriculture does not excite me. But to me now there is a charm
about a railway collision that is unspeakable. </p>

<p> There is nothing more beneficent than accident insurance. I
have seen an entire family lifted out of poverty and into
affluence by the simple boon of a broken leg. I have had people
come to me on crutches, with tears in their eyes, to bless this
beneficent institution. In all my experience of life, I have seen
nothing so seraphic as the look that comes into a freshly
mutilated man's face when he feels in his vest pocket with his
remaining hand and finds his accident ticket all right. And I
have seen nothing so sad as the look that came into another
splintered customer's face when he found he couldn't collect on a
wooden leg. </p>

<p> I will remark here, by way of advertisement, that that noble
charity which we have named the Hartford Accident Insurance
Company is an institution which is peculiarly to be depended
upon. A man is bound to prosper who gives it his custom. No man
can take out a policy in it and not get crippled before the year
is out. Now there was one indigent man who had been disappointed
so often with other companies that he had grown disheartened, his
appetite left him, he ceased to smile - said life was but a
weariness. Three weeks ago I got him to insure with us, and now
he is the brightest, happiest spirit in this land - has a good
steady income and a stylish suit of new bandages every day, and
travels around on a shutter. </p>

<p> I will say, in conclusion, that my share of the welcome to
our guest is none the less hearty because I talk so much
nonsense, and I know that I can say the same for the rest of the
speakers. <br>

<h1>RICHARDSON-TAYLOR REUNION NEWS</h1>

<hr>

<p><b><i>March 10, 1990</i></b> </p>

<p>The response to the last edition of the Reunion News was most
gratifying and, in some cases, frightening. I heard from quite a
few known and suspected members of the family, and picked up
quite a few addresses of people who probably did not want to be
found. Thanks to all of those who did reply, but it is still
apparent that we haven't tracked down all of the nefarious family
members so let's keep up the effort to track down, and thoroughly
embarrass all those family members who are trying to hide. </p>

<p>Bud called me one day to say that Laurence had called him to
suggest that we include with the Reunion News a brief update on
where everybody is and what they are doing. He staunchly
maintains that both he and Laurence were sober at the time. </p>

<p>He suggested that everyone should send in a short note on
their current doings and significant events and a dollar or so to
defray the expenses of producing and mailing the newsletter.
Monetary contributions to support this effort would be nice (all
blank checks eagerly accepted) but no one will be denied the
benefit(?) of this newsletter just because they failed to ante
up. </p>

<p>If you will drop me a line (as many have already) and let me
know of significant events in your life in the last year or so, I
will include them with the periodic reunion information so
everyone can know how your life is going to Hell in a handbasket.
</p>

<p>I have attached a form at the end of this letter which you can
fill out and return, if you wish, to help me keep all of the
information accurate. </p>

<p>All information on the forms is voluntary and I will not print
or give out anyone's address or any other information without
their permission. </p>

<p>Anyone who fails to report will, of course, have only the most
slanderous rumors printed about them. </p>

<p>Sincerely, </p>

<p>Clifford A. Schaffer </p>

<p><b>REUNION DETAILS</b> </p>

<p><b>DATE:</b> <b>June 23 and 24, 1990</b> </p>

<p><b>PLACE: Howarth Park - Summerfield Rd., Santa Rosa, CA</b>. </p>

<p>The park is located on the east side of town, and a map is
enclosed. There is hiking, fishing, swimming, a small park, and
an amusement park close by. There are also paddle boats at both
lakes. </p>

<p>On the back of one of the sheets she sent me, in an almost
illegible scrawl, Ruthie wrote, &quot;It is also close to a lot
of wineries.&quot; I'll bet it is. </p>

<p><b>FOOD </b></p>

<p>There will be snacks, dips, lots of other food, and plenty of
raw meat, roots, and berries for the Morrises. Dinner will be
early, at 3:30 or 4:00 on Saturday because of the previous bad
experiences when we tried to feed the Leards and Morrises after
dark. Whatever food is left after the first attack of the Leards
and Morrises will be placed on the edge of the camp all day
Sunday to draw them away from the rest of us. </p>

<p>People who live in the area should bring salad, beans, and
other such items. People who live farther away should bring
chips, dips, and dessert. Dinnerware will be provided, but bring
drinks and charcoal for your family. </p>

<p><b>CAMPGROUNDS</b> </p>

<p>There are campgrounds in Spring Lake Park. A copy of a
campsite reservation form is enclosed. Please make arrangements
early before the authorities get wind of what is going on. </p>

<p>There is also a KOA campground nearby with all of the usual
KOA stuff. The address is: </p>

<p>San Francisco North/Petaluma KOA </p>

<p>20 Rainsville Road </p>

<p>Petaluma, CA 94952 </p>

<p>(707) 763-1492 </p>

<p>(800) 992-CAMP (Calif. Reservations Only) </p>

<p><b>MOTELS</b> </p>

<p>For those who are used to sleeping indoors, there are several
motels located within about three miles of the park. Three of
them are listed below. Ruthie recommends that everyone make their
own motel reservations as the best method of coping with the
chaos of the reunion. </p>

<p>All motels can be reached by taking the Hearn Ave. exit from
the 101 freeway. All motels have swimming pools. </p>

<p><b><u>RATING</u></b><b> </b><b><u>NAME</u></b><b> </b><b><u>COSTS</u></b><b>
</b><b><u>PHONE</u></b> </p>

<p>Best El Rancho Tropicana $56.00 and up (707) 542-3655 </p>

<p>2200 Santa Rosa Ave. </p>

<p><i>Ask for the &quot;Golden State Discount&quot;</i> </p>

<p>Good Best Western Single - $45.00 (707) 546-4031 </p>

<p>1500 Santa Rosa Double - $54.00 </p>

<p>Fair TownHouse Single - $32.00 (707) 545-4711 </p>

<p>2363 Santa Rosa Double - $36.00 </p>

<p><b>FINANCES</b> </p>

<p>The contribution for this year's reunion is $8.00 for each
family - a family being defined as the members of a single
household. </p>

<p>The cost to attend this reunion is fairly small but Ruthie
wanted me to mention that we want everyone to attend and money
should not be a consideration. If anyone would like to attend,
but has a problem with funds, please contact Ruth or Laurence and
money will be provided (probably out of the leftovers of the
Taylor family bail fund). Any requests for assistance will be
kept entirely confidential. You may stay home because you are
scared or embarrassed, but don't stay home just because you're
broke. </p>

<p><b>FAMILY DOINGS </b></p>

<p>WHO THE HELL ARE THESE PEOPLE? </p>

<p>ARE THEY FAR, FAR AWAY FROM ME? </p>

<p>WHEN WILL THEY BE PAROLED? </p>

<p><b>INTRODUCTION</b> </p>

<p>I am pleased to report that the vast majority of people in the
family are apparently healthy, active, and doing well. We do not
yet have any relatives who are rich enough that we can all go
mooch off of them, but nobody seems to be starving either. </p>

<p><b>PASSINGS</b> </p>

<p>For all of those who were not aware, Mary Taylor died last
year. She and my grandmother, Laura Richardson, are the reasons
that we gather every year. She will be missed by all of us, but
we should all feel very lucky that we have had these women in our
lives. </p>

<p><b>THE FAMILY</b> </p>

<p>ALLSMAN, DOROTHY </p>

<p>(nee Richardson) - Currently selling real estate in Phoenix,
Arizona. The last time I spoke with her she made a point of
mentioning how much she enjoys meeting all of the nice people in
this family every year at the reunion. Her doctor tells me that
radical personality changes are common in persons of extreme age.
Ed has had some health problems which may limit their ability to
travel. </p>

<p>ALLSMAN, PAT </p>

<p>Pat is living in Phoenix, doing well, and he has developed
into a good judge of appropriate Christmas gifts. </p>

<p>ATKINSON, CHRISTINE </p>

<p>(nee Sweet), eldest of Margaret and Vic, is in Chicago,
working for First Boston Corp. doing something with computers.
She didn't mention anything specific about the opportunities for
embezzlement at her current position, but we know she will be
alert. She tells a fairly wild, and almost believable, story
about how her husband Scott travels a lot because of his
highfalutin position with something called Terra Museum. She
swears that it is not a front for drug smuggling. </p>

<p>BECK, META </p>

<p>Bud says she is doing well but he did not provide a lot of
details. He is probably covering up. </p>

<p>BERZ, RONNI </p>

<p>Meta's second. Currently living in Bakersfield and prospering
nicely with her husband, George, who works with computers. </p>

<p>HARTER, BARRI </p>

<p>No information. May be the same Barri Harter rumored to be
involved with Donald Trump. </p>

<p>JOHNSON, GLENDA </p>

<p>No current address. No information. May have been lost in
Borneo while filming the headhunters. </p>

<p>KRAMER, JOANNE </p>

<p>(nee Morris) - Joanne is living in Fresno and sends obscene
horoscopes to all those who write to her. She still labors under
the delusion that I am really Satan. </p>

<p>KRAMER, LARRY </p>

<p>son of Joanne, no relationship to the Japanese monster film
&quot;Son of Joanne.&quot; According to Joanne, he is living
with, and mooching off his mother in the finest Morris tradition.
</p>

<p>KRAMER, LESLIE MAUREEN </p>

<p>Daughter of Joanne, living in Cleveland and working as an
exotic dancer. (Yes, that's right.) She is the proud mother of
Crystal Ladd who, according to the sworn testimony of Joanne, is
an extraordinarily beautiful and talented child. </p>

<p>LEARD, DAVID </p>

<p>His years in the Navy permanently damaged his ability to tell
when it is too wet outside. He is currently living in the rain
forests of Seattle and doing something with computer systems. It
didn't surprise anyone that one of the Leards would eventually
return to the Bigfoot territory from whence they came. His wife
is pretty, intelligent, and very nice. He must have lied
tremendously to get her. </p>

<p>LEARD, DOUGLAS </p>

<p>Somehow the Richardson-Taylor arson gene went wrong in
Douglas. He puts out fires for a living, instead of starting
them, and apparently enjoys it. He and Barbara, and kids, live in
Rancho and, last time I checked, they were all doing well and
enjoying life. </p>

<p>LEARD, LOUISE </p>

<p>Louise is still living in the same old place in Sacramento
that she bought when houses were still $1.49. She is in good
health, reasonably good humor, and still unreasonably
conservative. She still says &quot;Well, now Michael . . .&quot;,
all the time, even when Michael is not around. </p>

<p>LEARD, MICHAEL </p>

<p>Michael just keeps on trucking. He is an air conditioning
expert at McClellan in Sacramento. He recently visited us in Los
Angeles and found that he actually could cope with the freeways
down here (but he still split as soon as he could anyway). He is
in good health but needs more practice with his .22 pistol. </p>

<p>LINK, BARBARA </p>

<p>(nee Sweet) - Barbara is married to Dan Link, a pastor with a
devotion to hopeless causes such as truth and morality. They
moved to Ruidoso, New Mexico, presumably to escape the shame and
guilt which follows excessively moral people in this family. The
name Ruidoso is Spanish for &quot;noisy&quot; which, Barbara
claims, has only a coincidental relationship to Dan's sermons. </p>

<p>MORRIS, ELEANOR </p>

<p>and Don - No current word from them, although I thought I
recognized Don playing Digit in &quot;Gorillas in the Mist.&quot;
Way to go with that second career, Fellah. </p>

<p>MORRIS, RICHARD </p>

<p>No current word on his activities. What can you say about a
Morris that hasn't already been grunted by someone else? I heard
that he was running a dress shop for transvestites and all I can
say is that Richard never denied it. </p>

<p>MORRIS, STEVEN </p>

<p>He is single (relatively speaking), working at DMV, and still
trying to impregnate every female in the city of Sacramento now
that the State has given up its effort to restrict his breeding.
Remember the family motto, Steve - <i>Never give your right name</i>.
</p>

<p>NEWCOMB, RUTH </p>

<p>(nee Taylor) - She is doing well and sends her love to
everyone. She mentioned that she is getting married very soon
(says she doesn't have to) and recommends bear traps and doe
scent as the perfect combination for nailing a man. She didn't
give his name but sent a nice picture of him bound and gagged in
the trunk of her car. Congrats, Ruthie. </p>

<p>PEREIRA, CARRIE </p>

<p>She recently had a baby, prompting Bud to lie far more than he
usually does. </p>

<p>PORTER, MICHAEL ANDREW </p>

<p>(Andy) son of Joanne Kramer - Currently living in Fullerton,
CA and doing well in sales. </p>

<p>PRUITT, BOB </p>

<p>No information. Could be the same Bob Pruitt responsible for
the Exxon Valdez disaster. </p>

<p>QUIGLEY, DONNA </p>

<p>(nee Morris) - Donna reportedly lives next door to Margie and
they are known as the Unholy Two in their neighborhood. A recent
effort by the City Council to evict them failed when the
authorities were unable to prove a connection to the rest of the
Morris family. </p>

<p>RICHARDSON, BILL </p>

<p>Bill and Dawn currently live in Ohio for no apparent reason,
and Bill is now working as a cost analyst after many, many years
with the U.S. Air Force. (You know - the people who brought us
the Stealth Bomber.) He gets Air Force retirement money and
probably makes a pretty good bundle at his current job, so he is
probably a good person to borrow money from. Dawn has, by all
accounts, consistently sullied the family reputation with a long
string of church work, good deeds, and other socially acceptable
do-gooder behavior which is totally alien to this family's
character. Mark, their eldest, is either on the high school
football team, or he is the high school football team, - it
wasn't clear from their letter. I saw a picture of Craig. He has
to be healthy. </p>

<p>RICHARDSON, BUD </p>

<p>He is in better health than he has a right to be, and claims
he is going to live forever. He called me just days after the
birth of his latest great grandkid and he had already concocted
the most astonishing stories about this child. </p>

<p>RICHARDSON, BECKY </p>

<p>Eldest of James and Edna. No information. She may be living
with a motorcycle gang responsible for several holdups in the
Central Valley. </p>

<p>RICHARDSON, JAMIE </p>

<p>Youngest of James and Edna. No information. Carried away by
Gypsies many years ago to the remotest reaches of Fresno County. </p>

<p>RICHARDSON, JAMES </p>

<p>Currently retired and residing in Fresno with Edna who, for
some strange reason, is a perfect match for James. His &quot;Old
Fart&quot; hat wore out so he is getting one that says
&quot;Older Fart.&quot; Unlike fine wines, the aroma of farts is
not greatly improved by aging. </p>

<p>RICHARDSON, JERRY </p>

<p>No information direct from Jerry but Bud tells me that he is
doing well. </p>

<p>RICHARDSON, LARRY </p>

<p>Bud tells the same story about Larry, further straining his
credibility. </p>

<p>RICHARDSON, PETE </p>

<p>Pete has not yet learned that exercise is bad for the health
so he continues to run every day. Despite all this running, to
the best of my knowledge, he has never caught anything more
significant than the common cold. He continues to compete and win
races in the Old and Decrepit category. </p>

<p>SCHAFFER, CLIFFORD </p>

<p>I am currently working as a computer systems consultant, write
a few articles now and then and, lately, am doing some public
speaking for the ACLU. Bonnie is a computer systems manager with
Pinkerton Detectives. </p>

<p>Serena and Alyssa are 15 and in high school. Serena is in
Flags with the marching band and Alyssa earned a letter last year
on the swim team. Melissa, 12, and Courtney, 10 are both doing
well. </p>

<p>SCHULKINS, JOYCE </p>

<p>No information. Rumored to be on an expedition to find
dinosaurs in Africa. </p>

<p>SCHULKINS, LARRY </p>

<p>No information. May be the same Larry Schulkins who is
currently a hostage in Beirut. </p>

<p>SWEET, JULIE </p>

<p>Julie is currently working at the Los Angeles Zoo, as an
animal keeper and trainer and thus would probably be the best
skilled person to manage the reunion. </p>

<p>SWEET, MARGARET </p>

<p>(nee Richardson) - Margaret sent out a letter with some
outrageous tale about how she and Vic are supposedly not old
enough to qualify for Social Security or something like that so
she is continuing to work. Margaret's letter starts out
&quot;Dear Friends and Relatives&quot;, which shows that she
draws a clear distinction between the two. Vic is working in a
funeral parlor so he should have a lot of creepy stories to tell
around the campfire. </p>

<p>TAYLOR, DAVID </p>

<p>No information or parole date. </p>

<p>TAYLOR, EDITH </p>

<p>No information. Probably on the run from the law. </p>

<p>TAYLOR, LAURENCE and WILMA </p>

<p>Laurence was caught telling the truth last year and had to
spend several weeks in therapy before he was well again. When you
talk to him you will see that he is much better now. </p>

<p>TAYLOR, LOUISE </p>

<p>No information. Possible KGB double agent. </p>

<h1>RICHARDSON-TAYLOR REUNION NEWS</h1>

<p><b>SPECIAL UPDATE</b> </p>

<p><b>May 12, 1990</b> </p>

<hr>

<p>Ruthie wrote me with a few updates to the prior information. </p>

<p>She says they were unable to get the park for Saturday
(something about too much police surveillance) so Saturday will
be at Spring Lake. </p>

<p>She is going to try to get &quot;the spot on your left just as
you come off the hill into the park area.&quot; Ruthie said that
if anyone has trouble finding the group she would leave a trail
of bread crumbs but, of course, that only works until the first
Morris shows up. If in doubt, look for the clouds of tear gas and
flashing police lights - the family will be in the middle. </p>

<p>Hot dogs and hamburgers will be served around noon, with the
big meal around 4:00 PM. Remember that, if you are approached by
any family member you do not immediately recognize, throw some
food away from your car. Do not attempt to feed them by hand. </p>

<p>Sunday will be at Howarth Park as previously stated. </p>

<p>She says to be sure to remember to bring all of the following
items: </p>

<p>bathing suits (to avoid the perennial lewd conduct charges) </p>

<p>lots of ice (to take the swelling down) </p>

<p>extra ice chests (storage space is always a problem) </p>

<p>snacks (in sealed packets so the Leards can't smell them) </p>

<p>charcoal (fire helps to keep the Morrises at bay) </p>

<p>drinks </p>

<p>Doug and Barbara should bring their game. Ruthie said that
everyone really enjoyed it as long as they were sober. </p>

<p>Ruthie says there are paddle boats, hiking trails (remember to
bring shoes), and a nice area for volleyball. </p>

<p>Ruthie also asked me to remind everyone that it is time to
send your contributions. The contribution is $8.00 per household
(cheaper than the average parking ticket) and should be sent to: </p>

<p>Ruth Newcomb </p>

<p>I still have not heard from all of the nefarious family
members with their most current family information. I would like
to publish a fairly complete update of the family information to
distribute at or near the reunion, so it would be nice if you
would all send it in. If you do not, I will do the most dastardly
thing possible - I will tell the truth about you. I am sure no
one wants that. </p>

<h1>RICHARDSON-TAYLOR REUNION NEWS</h1>

<hr>

<p>July 30, 1990 </p>

<p>Well, another reunion has come and gone and we can all breathe
a sigh of relief that we don't have to see <u>those</u> people
again for another year. It was a pretty good turnout with perhaps
a hundred people (anybody want to count?). As usual, everybody
got older but me. </p>

<p>We all owe thanks to Ruthie and Laurence for organizing
everything the way they did. The maps they sent me weren't the
greatest so, for all of you who thought Spring Lake park was
really in East Africa, I apologize for that. However, the parks
and all the fun and trimmings when we finally got there were very
good so I have to say that I thought they organized a pretty
successful reunion. You can always tell a successful reunion -
you can't recognize anyone. I hear that Margaret and Vic spent
most of Saturday morning with a nice family of Mexicans before
they realized it wasn't us. </p>

<p>I want to thank all of you who stepped forward to express your
appreciation for the work I did on the newsletter. I especially
want to thank all those who pulled Joanne off of me while she was
expressing her appreciation. My doctor says it was lucky I moved
when I did and there probably won't be any permanent scarring. </p>

<p>I understand that Margaret and Vic have volunteered to
organize next year's reunion, perhaps around the Carpenteria
area. I think they like that area primarily because it makes
people say &quot;Where?&quot;. It is around Santa Barbara - north
of L.A. It is a lovely oil-rich area with beautiful beaches which
have natural tar balls in the sand for your kids to track back to
your car. I am sure everyone will like it - just bring a few jars
of petroleum solvents. Assuming that Margaret still admits that
we are blood-related, I will keep you posted. </p>

<p>People who are easily offended should probably skip the Family
Doings section on Don Morris. I have made a considerable effort
to clean it up but it's hard to write anything about him and keep
it decent. </p>

<p>Sincerely, </p>

<p>Clifford A. Schaffer </p>

<p>Copyright 1990, C. A. Schaffer </p>

<p><b>FAMILY DOINGS </b></p>

<p>WHO THE HELL ARE THESE PEOPLE? </p>

<p>ARE THEY FAR, FAR AWAY FROM ME? </p>

<p>WHEN WILL THEY BE PAROLED? </p>

<p><b><u>INTRODUCTION</u></b> </p>

<p>This is the post-reunion dirt on everyone (that I am aware of)
who either showed up or sent back their forms. It is not the
complete family listing, if there ever could be one. I will do
another relatively complete update next year before the reunion. </p>

<p><b><u>PASSINGS</u></b> </p>

<p>Mary Taylor </p>

<p>Bob Taylor - son of Mary, one of the original old-time Taylors
</p>

<p>Jan Richardson - wife of Bud. She gave him a lot of love. </p>

<p>Our loss can only be measured by the blessings they have given
us. </p>

<p><b><u>THE FAMILY</u></b> </p>

<p><b>ALLSMAN, DOROTHY</b> (nee Richardson) </p>

<p>CHILDREN </p>

<p>Clifford Male </p>

<p>Patrick Male </p>

<p>She mentioned again how much she enjoys the reunion but said
her pain medication wasn't as strong as it should be. Like
Margaret and Bud, she claims to have a copy of the family history
that Mary produced. They all said they would send me a copy but,
apparently, they are afraid of what I might do with it. </p>

<p><b>BARBER, PATRICIA</b> &quot;Teisha&quot; (nee Taylor) </p>

<p>CHILDREN </p>

<p>Billy Male </p>

<p>Eric Male </p>

<p>The last time I saw Teisha she was about four years old. She
must be at least eleven or twelve by now. Teisha and husband Mike
and a friend have purchased a gold claim in the Siskiyou National
Forest. If they will agree to send me ten percent of whatever
they find I will promise not to send their address to everyone in
the family. </p>

<p>Mike is a Park Manager at Ft. Stevens Park in Oregon and
Teisha is an advertising clerk for Payless. Like all Taylors,
they spend most of their time in the woods, eating whatever they
manage to catch. </p>

<p>Both of the boys are groundskeepers for a military cemetery so
we should all make it a point not to ask them if they collect
anything. Billy is reportedly working for the county litter
patrol (if you don't have any they deliver) and will be hacking
trails through the wilderness for most of the summer. </p>

<p><b>BECK, META</b> (nee Richardson) </p>

<p>CHILDREN </p>

<p>Ronni Female </p>

<p>Carrie Female </p>

<p>Meta showed up at the reunion in a jocular mood and spent most
of her time fighting with Bud over which one of them was going to
show off her grandson. It was a tough battle, but I think Meta
won - best two falls out of three. She must be doing well because
she is considerably better fed than the last time I saw her. </p>

<p><b>BERZ, RONNI</b> </p>

<p>She was there with her husband, George, who seems to be a nice
enough guy, so there is no real explanation how he got mixed up
with this family. Like all macho computer guys he spent a lot of
time talking about his big hard disk, and showing off his son. Of
course, Bud is so proud you would think he had the kid himself. </p>

<p><b>BRYER, BRENT</b> </p>

<p>Currently managing cousin Gary's RV sales and service company
in Redding, and apparently making a bundle doing it. </p>

<p><b>HARTER, BERRI</b> </p>

<p>She works in the electronics industry and is doing well. No
longer involved with Donald Trump. </p>

<p><b>HEDRICK, MARGARET</b> (nee Morris) </p>

<p>CHILDREN </p>

<p>Scott Male </p>

<p>Nancy Female </p>

<p>This is the woman we all once knew as Margie Morris. She says
that her husband calls her &quot;Margaret&quot; which often leads
her to believe that she is really Margaret Sweet. It's easy to
get the two confused, especially if you are one. </p>

<p>She dragged Michael and me off into the woods and went into a
monster family-old-times-hugging fit. She has been married some
incredibly long time to a guy who is a combat veteran but is
scared to show up at the reunion, and is currently living with
Donna. They tell me that Nancy (current last name unknown) is
living in the same town. Most legal authorities agree that three
Morrises in the same town is prima facie evidence of a criminal
conspiracy. </p>

<p><b>KRAMER, JOANNE</b> (nee Morris) </p>

<p>CHILDREN </p>

<p>Michael Andrew Porter Male </p>

<p>Laurence Kramer Male </p>

<p>Leslie Kramer Female </p>

<p>She says she is working as a supervisory
&quot;registered&quot; nurse (Fresno County still requires
Morrises to be registered) in a hospital in Fresno. Can you
imagine waking up from a coma to find Joanne standing over you?
I'd probably get religion. Would you trust this woman with your
bedpan? </p>

<p>Joanne listed no Significant Other and complained that the
destruction of the rain forests is making it hard for her to find
good dates. She pines for the good old days when she could just
hide down by the railroad tracks and catch them unawares. She
says that if anyone knows any good men she will pay all costs of
capture, crating, and shipping. </p>

<p>As achievements, Joanne says she finally got her student loan
paid off, probably making her the only Morris to ever pay a bill.
</p>

<p><b>KRAMER, LAURENCE</b> </p>

<p>Joanne says he is working at Vendo drilling holes in vending
machines which has always been sort of a family tradition among
the Morrises. I remember that most of the vending machines at
Fort Miller had the Morris family trademarks on them. Did you
ever wonder why the Morrises always paid for everything with a
bag of dimes? </p>

<p><b>KRAMER, LESLIE</b> </p>

<p>CHILDREN </p>

<p>Crystal Female </p>

<p>She called me (fairly frantically but I won't say why) and
said she had fond memories from her youngest years of how her
Grandpa, Don Morris, would bounce her on his knee and sing her
his happy children's songs which are far too obscene to print.
Even though she was very young at the time, she still remembered
the words quite clearly and she sang one to me over the phone. I
could have had her arrested. </p>

<p>Joanne says that Leslie has fallen in love with a &quot;nice
Italian boy&quot; (as if there really was one), with an adorable
grandmother from the old country who speaks broken English, much
like the Morrises themselves. </p>

<p>Leslie brought the &quot;nice Italian boy&quot; to the reunion
(he was the one with the shoulder holster) and introduced him
around. Joanne tried to convince me that he is a Mafia hit man,
but that's only wishful thinking on her part because she wants
Leslie to date a man with a profession. </p>

<p><b>LEARD, DOUGLAS</b> </p>

<p>CHILDREN </p>

<p>Douglas Jr. Male </p>

<p>Timothy Male </p>

<p>Gummo Male </p>

<p>Maurice Male </p>

<p>Zeppo Male </p>

<p>Douglas was there with wife Barbara. His list of children may
have some omissions because they didn't send back their forms. I
didn't get a chance to talk much with them but they seem to be
healthy and in good humor. </p>

<p><b>LEARD, LOUISE</b> (nee Richardson) </p>

<p>CHILDREN </p>

<p>Douglas Male </p>

<p>David Male </p>

<p>Michael Male </p>

<p>She shamelessly claims that she spent twenty-six and a half
years &quot;working for the State of California&quot; (an obvious
contradiction in terms) before she retired. She says she now has
more time for the typical little old lady activities such as
traveling (your tax dollars are paying for that), gardening,
shopping (your tax dollars again), walking and just being lazy.
(How is this so different than government work?) </p>

<p>In an astonishing lapse of judgment she admits to having
produced three children, now variously known as Douglas, David,
and Michael. She has not yet seen fit to apologize to anyone for
that. </p>

<p>Louise said these letters were OK &quot;as long as you don't
pick on the Leards too much.&quot; Get real, lady. We ought to
have a Best Leard Joke contest. (No one gets to submit David
Leard.) </p>

<p><b>LEARD, MICHAEL</b> </p>

<p>CHILDREN </p>

<p>None admitted. </p>

<p>He bought a home in North Highlands and claims to be getting
cooperation from his neighbors, probably because they think he is
a member of a motorcycle gang. </p>

<p>He recently bought a .357 magnum, after trying mine out on the
crowds in downtown L.A., and is now laying for the neighbor's
cat. Fire the first shot in the air, Michael. It gets them
running and makes it a whole lot more fun. </p>

<p><b>LINK, BARBARA</b> (nee Sweet) </p>

<p>She and Dan didn't show up but Magaret brought some pictures
which may explain why. They live so far out in the boonies that
they have to drive in to town just to use the outhouse. </p>

<p><b>MORRIS, ELINOR</b> (nee Richardson) </p>

<p>CHILDREN </p>

<p>Gary Male </p>

<p>Donna Female </p>

<p>Joanne Female </p>

<p>Harpo Male </p>

<p>Robert Male </p>

<p>Richard Male </p>

<p>Margie Female </p>

<p>Chico Male </p>

<p>Nancy Female </p>

<p>Steven Male </p>

<p>Jeff Male </p>

<p>Several people wrote to say they were surprised to learn that
was Don in &quot;Gorillas in the Mist&quot;. Amazing realism,
they said, but he looks a lot different with his hair combed. I
understand that he is currently working on his autobiography, <u>Knuckle
Tracks in the Sand</u>. </p>

<p>Don was there this year, but Elinor was not. Seems she gets a
backache just thinking about coming to the reunion. Don was
looking fairly fit (he can still carry his gut around) and he was
exceptionally well-behaved until someone coaxed him out of the
tree. </p>

<p>He is wearing suspenders now, which should help to cure the
breakaway pants problem which earned him the trophy for Most
Embarrassing Relative. After his belt got to a certain point on
his waistline there was nothing else to stop it, and away his
pants would go, far too fast for his reflexes to catch them. His
lack of underwear was the really special touch which put away the
competition year after year. I understand he even accidentally
mooned Nancy's fiance the first time they met. His timing was
always impeccable. </p>

<p>Actually the trophy for Most Embarrassing Relative was retired
in 1975 when he successfully completed his 10,000th career LPF
(Loud Public Fart). Younger family members will recognize it as
the Don Morris Memorial Award For Embarrassing Conduct, better
known as the &quot;Fellah&quot;. </p>

<p>He has had many, many memorable LPFs including some real
stunners in places such as churches, fine restaurants, and
crowded elevators. </p>

<p>One window-rattler occurred when someone invited him to attend
church (never a good idea) in the mistaken belief that it would
have some beneficial effect on his moral fiber. He stopped the
minister's sermon dead in its tracks and had half the
congregation looking out the windows for storm clouds. &quot;I
just couldn't resist,&quot; Don grinned. &quot;It echoes so
nice.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;The maitre' d thought I crapped my pants!&quot; Don says
proudly about another incident. </p>

<p>&quot;Sir, would you like some assistance?&quot; the maitre' d
asked discreetly. </p>

<p>&quot;No thanks,&quot; said Don, &quot;I can fart pretty good
all by myself.&quot; </p>

<p>In crowded elevators, his sighs of relief are perhaps even
more disturbing than the actual event itself. </p>

<p>If you really want to know some of the history of why the
trophy was retired, you should ask him to tell you about the time
he got hold of some bad water while driving across the desert
with his boss and his boss's wife. </p>

<p>He says he is too old to be a threat to women anymore but that
is probably just a ruse to lure them closer. It is still better
to be safe than sorry. When some men get to his age they tend to
lose their inhibitions. </p>

<p><b>NEWCOMB, DOUGLAS</b> </p>

<p>CHILDREN </p>

<p>Joey Male </p>

<p>Pam Female </p>

<p>Josh Male </p>

<p>Recently moved from North Carolina to Oregon with wife Joann
and their multiple children. Currently working in Forklift sales.
</p>

<p><b>NEWCOMB, PAUL</b> </p>

<p>CHILDREN </p>

<p>Kristi Female </p>

<p>Ruthie says Paul is a &quot;20-year man&quot; but she didn't
indicate whether that was the Marines or San Quentin. </p>

<p><b>NEWCOMB, RUTH</b> (nee Taylor) </p>

<p>CHILDREN </p>

<p>Numerous, I am not clear how many, and I don't think she is
either. </p>

<p>She proudly confirmed the name of her fiance, Tom Springer -
she showed me the driver's license she found in his wallet. He
was there and he seemed to be a nice enough guy, but probably a
little dazed by it all, and more than a little concerned about
what Ruthie considers to be humorous. </p>

<p>Ruthie says she is getting married in August and her grandson
Ed will give her away. His is a joy I am sure we wish we all
could share. </p>

<p>Ruthie said that she thought that she would have five of hers
(so we know she has at least five children) there at the reunion
for the first time in 17 years (apparently a few of them were
just let out). She didn't tell me whether she actually achieved
that but how could I tell anyway? </p>

<p><b>NEWCOMB, STEVE</b> </p>

<p>CHILDREN </p>

<p>Bridget Female </p>

<p>Steve is married to wife Colleen, and working as a carpenter
in Santa Rosa. </p>

<p><b>PORTER, MICHAEL ANDREW</b> </p>

<p>I got no word from Andy but instead received a note from some
woman who identified herself as Christie Clayton (an obvious
alias) and said that Andy had been snared by &quot;a nice young
girl&quot; (where have we heard that before?). She also said that
she was going to marry him next year and presumably attempt to
breed him in captivity. </p>

<p>From what Joanne says, she is apparently fairly well-educated
(a high school diploma and actual college classes and stuff) and
her interest in Andy has nothing at all to do with her primate
research project. Christie seems to be a devious type of person
so she will probably fit in well. Joanne says Christie works in
the Disaster Coordination Office for Orange County which is why
she insisted that Christie attend the reunion. </p>

<p>This same woman, or someone purporting to be her, showed up at
the reunion with Andy in tow. He used to be a scrawny little
sucker but he ain't no more - the Morris blood lines are
beginning to show as he ages. He is working as a customer service
rep - probably for a loan shark. He laughed about the tricks we
used to play on him when he was a kid. He said he got over most
of his anger soon after the casts came off. </p>

<p>Joanne says that Andy has surprised everyone and turned into a
&quot;responsible human being&quot;. One must keep Joanne's
perspective in mind. </p>

<p><b>QUIGLEY, DONNA</b> (nee Morris) </p>

<p>CHILDREN </p>

<p>Rick Male </p>

<p>Amy Female </p>

<p>Manfred Male </p>

<p>Felix Male </p>

<p>Julius Male </p>

<p>Donna showed up with her boyfriend Lyle and no clear
explanation of where she got that last name. She and Margie spent
most of the time telling a lot of lies about me as a child. The
truth is that I never did any of those things. Neither she nor
Margie has provided a list of their children they can still
remember. </p>

<p><b>RICHARDSON, BECKY</b> </p>

<p>CHILDREN </p>

<p>Refuses to say. </p>

<p>She showed up at the reunion with some apparently nameless
guy. I have seen him before but he still looks suspicious. She
said his name is &quot;Sadistic Sid&quot; Smith, but he doesn't
look quite that civilized. She did not say what his position was
in the motorcycle gang. </p>

<p>On the subject of her occupation she wisely pleads the Fifth
Amendment but says that she is making a major contribution to the
financial health of the California wine industry. She admits to
no children or, more correctly, says the government will not
release the records. </p>

<p><b>RICHARDSON, BUD</b> </p>

<p>CHILDREN </p>

<p>Meta Female </p>

<p>Larry Male </p>

<p>Jerry Male </p>

<p>By Acquisition from Jan </p>

<p>Brent Bryer Male </p>

<p>Berri Harter Female </p>

<p>How many people knew his real name was Austin? Yeah, you're
lying too. Bud clearly holds the record for the best-preserved
alias - not even his own family knew his real name. </p>

<p>Bud, the elder statesman of the family, looks to be in great
shape. He said he was going to videotape everyone at the reunion
and have them actually identify themselves, but I guess some of
the family had legal objections or something so I don't know if
he got around to it. </p>

<p>As achievements, Bud lists ten grandchildren, and one great
grandson (it is undetermined whether the word &quot;great&quot;
refers to actual family lineage or is just Bud's opinion). </p>

<p>He also suggested that we should produce a family tree. He may
be so old that he is simply beyond shame. I have ordered some
computer software which will allow me to produce one. It should
embarrass everybody. </p>

<p><b>RICHARDSON, JAMES</b> </p>

<p>CHILDREN </p>

<p>Becky Female </p>

<p>Jamie Female </p>

<p>I have to correct the impression I left when I said that
&quot;old farts&quot; were not greatly improved by aging. In
truth, he smells about as good as he ever did. </p>

<p>He and Edna were there and the years seem to be treating them
fairly well. Edna says she is still working while James has
already retired. James is no fool. </p>

<p>My kids tell me that James sagely counseled them to drink beer
and smoke pot. Thanks, James, you're a real help. Edna
specifically requested that Bonnie and I and kids attend the
reunion because (to paraphrase her) &quot;misery loves
company.&quot; </p>

<p>On Sunday James engaged Laurence and Don in a lively
discussion of which type of truck and tractor seats produce the
biggest hemorrhoids. I think they finally agreed on unpadded
metal tractor seats. Never let it be said that we don't have
intellectuals in this family. </p>

<p><b>RICHARDSON, JAMIE</b> </p>

<p>CHILDREN </p>

<p>None admitted. </p>

<p>Jamie says she is currently working as a &quot;respiratory
care practitioner&quot; which she did not explain, but says it is
not the same as selling pot. She said that she is currently at a
Catholic hospital but she didn't make it clear if that is where
she works, or just where they keep her at night. </p>

<p>Jamie says she previously spent fifteen years with the County
of Fresno. She must be referring to employment because they don't
usually hold people in county jails that long unless it is a long
series of offenses. She admits to no children and says she has
been spayed, which allows her to engage in a much greater variety
of disgusting behavior. </p>

<p>As achievements she says she has a cat and pays her own bills,
both of which are apparently new for her. As hobbies she says she
skis cross-country (it helps to be in practice when you are
taking it on the lam), and hikes in the woods, where she meets
more relatives than she cares to mention. Like Becky, she is
making a major contribution to the California wine industry, with
a marginal preference for corked, rather than screw-capped, wine.
</p>

<p><b>RICHARDSON, JERRY</b> </p>

<p>CHILDREN </p>

<p>Jerry Jr. Male </p>

<p>Terri Lynn Female </p>

<p>He and wife Karen did not show up. Bud says he is working for
Santa Clara County and is doing well. </p>

<p><b>RICHARDSON, LARRY</b> </p>

<p>He showed up with his hair and beard dyed mostly gray as part
of his Moses imitation. Like Meta, he seems to be pretty well
fed. I didn't get to talk to him much but Bud says he works for
Baltimore Cooling Towers in Madera and has just moved into a new
home. </p>

<p><b>RICHARDSON, PETE</b> </p>

<p>Pete showed up and related the story of how he told the truth
on a few occasions some years back. It's an old story, but he
tells it well, and we all enjoyed hearing it again. </p>

<p>He says he is going to run in the Nationals in Indianapolis in
August. If he will keep me posted, I will let you know how he
does. </p>

<p><b>SHEETS, KATHY</b> (nee Newcomb) </p>

<p>CHILDREN </p>

<p>Ed Male </p>

<p>Drew Male </p>

<p>Ed is a lucky kid. Ruthie says that with feet like his he
never has to buy swim fins. Kathy works as a wine-maker and makes
extra money by renting out Ed's old shoes as duplexes. Terry, her
husband, drives a truck. Ruthie did not say whether he is a
Teamster so I don't know anything about his possible criminal
background. Ed and Drew are reportedly &quot;two of the very best
baseball players anywhere.&quot; (Ruthie's words, apply the
Taylor Veracity Factor.) </p>

<p><b>SWEET, MARGARET</b> (nee Richardson) </p>

<p>CHILDREN </p>

<p>Christine Female </p>

<p>Barbara Female </p>

<p>Julie Female </p>

<p>This year she became the first woman in the family to openly
admit having four-footed grandchildren. (Laura Richardson was
actually the first, with the birth of the Morrises, but everyone
was too polite to mention it.) She did a heavy-duty grandmother
routine and bored us all half to death with about a hundred
pictures of mountain lions, cheetahs, and the other beasts Julie
works with at the L.A. Zoo. They were cute. Margaret says that
Julie is well-behaved and does not fight with them over the food
dish. </p>

<p><b>TAYLOR, DON</b> </p>

<p>Bob &amp; Edith's eldest is a winemaker in Oakville, CA
(notice how many Taylors are involved in making wine) and
recently married wife Rosemary on April Fool's Day. Fools rush in
. . . </p>

<p><b>TAYLOR, EDITH</b> </p>

<p>She was at the reunion, looking good, and apparently no longer
on the run from the law. </p>

<p><b>TAYLOR, LAURENCE</b> </p>

<p>Laurence was there with his famous hat. It really makes you
wonder, doesn't it? At first I thought he wore it to hold his
brains in, but then I realized that couldn't be true. Some
relatives said that what I reported about Laurence was not
correct at all. Contrary to what I said, they asserted that
Laurence had not been caught telling the truth, and stated they
found it difficult to believe that he ever would be caught
telling the truth. My apologies, Laurence. </p>

<p>Laurence spent a good deal of time telling about his work with
the FAA. He says that he is not an Air Traffic Controller but
does something to maintain the equipment all of the Air Traffic
Controllers use. I am sure that we will all feel better about
flying just knowing Laurence is on the job. </p>

<p><b>TAYLOR, LOUISE</b> </p>

<p>She was there at the reunion looking good and doing well. No
word on whether she is still connected to the KGB. </p>

<p><b>TAYLOR, ROBERT</b> </p>

<p>Bob &amp; Edith's youngest is a history teacher and basketball
coach, presumably at some sort of school, in Woodland Hills,
California. He recently took it on the lam to Egypt, Greece, and
Turkey. No word yet on whether he managed to make it through
Customs coming back. </p>

<h1><i>Richardson-Taylor Reunion News </i> </h1>

<p>Last call to make your plans for the annual reunion! If you
have not made arrangements to attend the reunion you should do it
now. </p>

<p>Margaret sent me a couple of maps to help you out in locating
the more important sites in the area of the reunion. You may note
that she has indicated the location of her home on one of the
maps. I am not sure, but I believe she mentioned that if anyone
could not find any other camping space or an available motel,
they could camp on her front lawn. No need to call - just pitch
your tent and be there when she wakes up in the morning. She
should enjoy it. </p>

<p>Margaret says she has a new grandchild, and Bud a new
great-grandchild, so you can expect both of them to be
particularly boastful this year. Dorothy says that Margaret is an
unusually aggressive grandmother so it may be best to avoid her
altogether. </p>

<p>Only a few of you have sent back your family information
forms. Of course, there is no compulsion to send in your form (or
contributions) - it is entirely voluntary. You will note,
however, that Don and Elinor did not send theirs in last year.
This year, Elinor was quite prompt. </p>

<p>As you all may have expected, there has been no word from the <b>low-down,
no-good Richardson individual living in Ohio who has never
attended even a single family reunion.</b> (Due to my extreme
respect for <b>Bill Henry</b>, I will not mention the name of
this thoroughly disreputable individual.) </p>

<p>Because the <b>low-down, no-good Richardson individual living
in Ohio who has never attended even a single family reunion</b>
has not returned his family information form, and has no apparent
intention of attending even a single family reunion, I shall have
to fill in his family's information the best I can. Therefore, I
am asking all of you to think hard and come up with all the
stories from this individual's past which most clearly delineate
his complete lack of character. There are a number of episodes
from his past which I am quite certain he would not want repeated
under any circumstances (I can think of several that are so
disgusting they would gag a maggot and make a hooker blush) so
let's collect all of these tales and make sure they are published
where all the world can read them. Because <b>he has never
attended even a single family reunion</b> we all know that he is
beyond shame, but perhaps we can induce some shame in some other
member of his immediate family. </p>

<p>I have completed the editing and formatting of Mary Taylor's
family history and I had intended to include it in this mailing,
but my laser printer is having serious problems so it will have
to wait. Besides, I am not sure if I want to send something so
worthwhile to that <b>low-down, no-good Richardson individual
living in Ohio who has never attended even a single family
reunion.</b> With any luck I should be able to have it printed
and ready to distribute to anyone who attends the reunion, which
will naturally exclude that <b>low-down, no-good Richardson
individual living in Ohio who has never attended even a single
family reunion.</b> </p>

<p>We will see you all at the reunion (with the exception of a
certain nameless and shameless Richardson individual). Call
Margaret if you have any questions. </p>

<h1>Richardson-Taylor Reunion News</h1>

<hr>

<p>Just when you thought, even hoped, that it would never happen
again, it is time to start planning for the next reunion. </p>

<p>Margaret and Vic were our hosts last year. They left town
immediately after the reunion, claiming that the timing of their
move was just a coincidence. The last I heard they were holed up
in a cave in the badlands of New Mexico. </p>

<p>As usual, we were supremely graced by the absence of several
disreputable Richardson individuals living in Ohio who have never
attended a single reunion. (As I have stated before, I do not
wish to embarrass <b>Bill Henry</b> by mentioning any names, or
by pointing out that <b>he is the only original Richardson who
has never shown his face at any reunion.</b>) I asked several
people if they had heard from these no-good people, seeing as how
they had not replied to any of the notices, or even returned
their family information sheets. (The truth must be far too
shameful for even them to admit.) The Hell's Angels have a rather
unique reproach for people who fall asleep at their parties and I
felt it was only fair that we also have a similar reproach for
people who consistently fail to attend reunions for a solid
decade. </p>

<p>I put out the word that I am interested in collecting, and
publishing, stories from this individual's past which would show
his most disgusting habits and complete lack of character. He
moved his family away from the rest of us just about the time his
kids were learning to talk so, no doubt, they have not heard the
best part of this low-down, no-good individual's criminal career.
</p>

<p>As soon as I put out the word for stories of this type, Louise
Leard and Margaret Sweet immediately leapt to his defense saying
that he is a very busy and important person (they don't have
enough practice lying to make it sound believable) and they were
sure there was some good reason why this <b>low-down, no-good
individual had missed every single reunion in the last ten years</b>.
Of course, this just illustrates my point about this individual's
character. </p>

<p>How low must one sink before Margaret and Louise come to your
defense? (They have never defended my good character, or come to
the defense of any Morris that I can recall.) They both
proclaimed with the loudness of an incompetent liar that this
individual had always been of sterling character and that there
were no terrible tales to tell from his childhood. They were so
loud, in fact, that I could not catch most of the details of the
stories Don and Laurence were telling about him. I believe that
Don may have gotten this individual mixed up with Herman Klomp in
some of the stories but that's not important </p>

<p>It is a sad case indeed when Margaret and Louise are left to
stick up for you. In any case, you should all know that I will be
collecting the most embarrassing stories about this low-down,
no-good individual and publishing them soon, so his family may
know the complete truth about why he consistently fails to attend
even a single family reunion. </p>

<p>Those of you who attended know that I passed around copies of
Mary Taylor's Family History which I transcribed and printed out
on the computer. I am not entirely sure who got copies so I have
included some copies in this newsletter for the people who
weren't there. (This, of course, includes the <b>low-down,
no-good Richardson individual from Ohio who has never attended a
single family reunion</b>.) If you did not receive a copy at the
reunion, and I did not include one for you here, just drop me a
line and I will send you a copy. It is a pretty interesting view
of the family's history going back a couple of centuries,
although some people have commented that Mary was rather
&quot;optimistic&quot; in recounting the facts. </p>

<p>There was an unusually aggressive pack of grandparents at the
reunion, all of them armed with a deadly arsenal of baby
pictures. Margaret and Vic, having waited so long for their first
two-footed grandchild, were perhaps the most vicious of the
bunch. Margaret showed me some pictures of her and I had to admit
that she is an incredibly beautiful child, with a sparkling
personality, and possessed of talents that ordinary human beings
can scarcely imagine. As soon as I did admit it, Margaret took
her foot off my throat, Vic picked me up, dusted me off, and they
both allowed as how they had always known that I was a gentleman
of intelligence and good taste. </p>

<p>Margaret and Vic were apparently unable to persuade Julie to
attend the reunion. Julie explained to me that, although she
works at the LA Zoo, she has no direct experience with large
primates. Julie puts on little shows at the LA Zoo where, among
other things, she sings a duet with a coyote. (Really!) It's
pretty interesting, but it must be said that the coyote has the
distinctly better voice. Julie also raised a mountain lion in her
home (how'd you like have this chick for a neighbor?). She said
there was no problem at all as long as she had dinner ready on
time and didn't make any sudden movements. </p>

<p>Dorothy showed up with that old tale about how she went to the
hospital and the nurse wrote on her chart that she &quot;looks at
least ten years younger than her stated age.&quot; If you haven't
heard that story yet, just get within fifty yards of her, and I
am sure the subject of medical charts will come up soon enough.
We will probably have to listen to that until she is at least ten
years older than her stated age. </p>

<p>James pontificated quite a while about the problems of these
United States and how he would solve them if he was king. Cut off
some bodily part, he said, every time someone commits a crime.
Lop off a hand, or an arm, or a foot, or something more valuable,
he said. It's an interesting idea but, if that was really the
law, his nickname would have been &quot;Stubby&quot; for many
years now. In the interests of justice and fair play, he said he
would not impose any penalties for anyone who chose to
prevaricate. In fact, he said, that is one of the few areas where
he thinks government subsidies would be justified. </p>

<p>James allows that some Richardsons, and perhaps a few Taylors,
might have committed some minor variations from the absolute
facts on rare occasions, but swears that he has never been known
to tamper with the truth. I thought about that quite a while and
then I had to admit that he was probably right. I could not
recall any time that he had been close enough to the truth that
he could have been accused of tampering with it. </p>

<p>Edna admits that her once-famous morals are gone. She says she
saves her copies of the Reunion News. </p>

<p>Doug and Barbara were there with their delightfully comatose
children. They recently made a trip with a motorcycle gang down
to the tip of Baja where they frolicked with the mating whales,
burned and pillaged a few mountain villages, participated in a
few large drug shipments, and had many other exciting adventures.
They came to visit us on the way back and took us out for a nice
Mexican food dinner -- which is not always a good idea when a
Leard is around. (I am sure we have all had an unfortunate
adventure in that regard.) </p>

<p>&quot;We didn't get the <i>turistas</i> near as bad as we
thought we would!&quot; Doug shouted through the bathroom door. I
was glad. </p>

<p>Pete has had a busy year. He says that he is still winning
foot races even at his advanced age, although he still hasn't
explained why someone would want to deliberately run around in a
circle just so they could get back to where they started before
somebody else did. He says he went to some track meet back in
Indianapolis where (he claims) he won the 400 and 800 meter races
and placed second in the 1500, or some such nonsense. When this
statement was greeted with some modest skepticism, he swore that
it was true (his standard first reply) and said the <b>low-down,
no-good Richardson individual who lives in Ohio and has never
attended even a single family reunion</b> would verify everything
he said. If two Richardsons swear to it, it's got to be true,
Pete said. Alternatively, he offered to swear on a stack of
family birth certificates. </p>

<p>As most of you already know (with the exception perhaps of
certain <b>low-down, no-good Richardson individuals living in
Ohio who have never attended a single family reunion</b>), Pete
has taken a wife, Sandy. Sandy said she thinks his name is Paul
and that what attracted her to Pete was his refined, gentlemanly
manners. As you might expect, that caused a good deal of
hilarity. </p>

<p>She is a Bohemian kind of person who wears funny clothes and
calls herself an &quot;artist&quot; and a &quot;designer&quot;,
although she was a little fuzzy on just what it is she
&quot;designs&quot;. I was in her company for most of two days
and she never did pass around any good drugs so there is some
question about her artistic credentials. She does, however, like
beer, and seems to be friendly even when she has had a few. She
claimed to be a lady of refinement and good taste before I got
the pictures of her with her head stuck in a watermelon. Most of
us hadn't seen such a sight since James sold his livestock. She
fits in pretty well. </p>

<p>David Leard did not attend this year. He sent me a Christmas
card with a rather snide remark about how I must have learned my
writing skills in jail -- a crack which was totally uncalled for
considering all the nice things I have said about the Leards.
David said that he was making huge sums of money in real estate
but he sent no cash. </p>

<p>In a prepared statement, Louise Leard said that David's recent
ventures in real estate had nothing at all to do with the failure
of several savings and loans in the Seattle area and she was
confident that the criminal investigations would exonerate him
completely. She explained that David did not attend the reunion
because one of his escrows did not close when it should have so
he was not legally allowed to leave town. We all nodded like we
believed everything she said. </p>

<p>Jerry was there promoting beer as the answer to a balanced
diet. He swears that he cannot be recognized without a beer can
in his hand. I recognized him immediately, but then the pile of
beer cans had shifted and his head was sticking out. </p>

<p>Last year I received an invitation to Laurence and Wilma's
wedding, of all things. Laurence and Wilma said they were
inviting me to attend because I am &quot;an important part&quot;
of their lives. I wondered a long time what they meant by that.
Then I realized Laurence had to be talking about the time we all
got drunk and trashed his apartment. When we left, Laurence was
standing out on the balcony in his underwear, yelling something
at us. If he had been sober enough to remember who we were, I am
sure he would have made sense. It's times like those that make a
family. </p>

<p>From what I could gather from the invitation, it seems that
Laurence actually asked Wilma to marry him some twenty-five years
ago or so, and it has taken this long to convince her that it is
a good idea. He lies pretty good, but apparently not good enough
to put that one across right away. </p>

<p>Ruthie and Tom were there. She wanted me to correct a minor
misstatement that I made in a previous issue of the Reunion News.
She said she wanted to make it clear that she <u>did not</u> send
me a picture of Tom bound and gagged in the trunk of her car.
Apparently it was some other guy. </p>

<p>Tom, who was pretty frisky the year before, looked a little
tired at times, like someone who had just spent the last year as
the only rooster in a ten acre hen house. Ruthie, on the other
hand, says she loves married life. She explains that Tom is still
in shock from the last reunion, which is certainly
understandable. Maybe it was just more than he expected. </p>

<p>Joanne was there, and managed to wrestle a few of the other
grandmothers to the ground to show them pictures of her accused
grandchildren. She called me after the reunion with some
grandiose scheme to lure unsuspecting men into joining a computer
dating service. I don't know why she wanted it on a computer, it
was pretty obvious which chick was going to get the date. </p>

<p>The last I heard, Joanne said her son, Laurence Kramer, was
working as a taste-tester on an alfalfa farm in Nevada. </p>

<p>I asked Becky why Jamie has missed the last few reunions. She
said that the reunions are usually scheduled the same week as the
Gay Pride parade in San Francisco and Jamie goes to the parade
instead of the reunion. That way, she says, she doesn't run into
quite so many oddballs. </p>

<p>Don Morris says that Elinor does not write letters, but I got
one from her last year thanking me for all the nice things I said
about Don in the last Family Doings. She was, however, a little
miffed that I failed to mention two of her children, Bonzo and
Cheetah Morris. </p>

<p>Don was there. It would purely amaze you, but he is just as
good-looking and charming as he ever was. He may have slowed down
a step or two but any sudden body movements can still clear out a
crowd just as quick as ever. Margaret and Vic thought ahead and
chose a windswept beach for the reunion. Like all the Morrises,
Don complained a lot about how hard it is to find comfortable
shoes for feet with an opposing thumb. He says that Elinor
&quot;understood&quot; all those little jokes I wrote in the last
Reunion News but confessed that some of it was just too
intellectual for him. I helped him count his bananas and told him
I understood how confusing these letters can be. </p>

<p>&quot;You can't insult a Morris,&quot; Don said. It ain't for
lack of trying. </p>

<p>Some people disputed my previous statements about Don. They
thought I flattered him unnecessarily and said they did not
believe he had ever been in church. I assert that he has,
although (by mutual agreement with the minister) it never was a
regular thing. &quot;We love our Brother Don,&quot; the minister
said, &quot;but even Jesus has limits.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;If they don't want you to fart, why do they call it a
pew?&quot; Don asked indignantly. He does not understand much
about religion. </p>

<p>Did you ever wonder what happened to Baby Huey when he retired
from comic books? I met Jeff Morris when he was wandering around
down on the beach, still wearing the radio tracking collar the
game wardens gave him. He was roaming around pretty freely so I
assumed he was out of range of their receivers. His fur is not as
long as Don's but the consensus of opinion is that they are the
same sub-species. </p>

<p>&quot;Cliffy,&quot; he said. &quot;Long time, no see.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Most of the time, not long enough,&quot; I said. </p>

<p>&quot;Didn't you used to have long hair and a beard?&quot;
Jeff asked. </p>

<p>&quot;Nope, I always had a crew cut and I was clean-shaven.
You must be thinking of your sisters. You remember.&quot; I told
him. </p>

<p>&quot;Oh, yeah, now I remember,&quot; he said. &quot;You look
a lot different with a beard.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Say, Jeff, what are you doing these days?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Being a bum, mooching off my Dad, getting into
trouble.&quot; </p>

<p>I was surprised. He seems safe, though it's hard to tell with
anything that big. </p>

<p>&quot;Say, Jeff,&quot; I asked, &quot;how many tranquilizer
darts does it take to bring you down?&quot; </p>

<p>He said he didn't know for sure and then told me some
outlandish story about how some woman wanted him to come live
with her and just be a bum over at her place. It's the Morris
dream but he didn't have all the details consistent. </p>

<p>I got some real nice pictures of Don and Jeff and I showed
them to the clerk in the drug store when I got them developed. </p>

<p>&quot;A friend of mine shot one of those things in Northern
Washington,&quot; he said. &quot;His wife wouldn't let him bring
it in the house.&quot; That confused me. </p>

<p>&quot;David Leard lives up that way, but no Morrises that I
know of.&quot; I told him. </p>

<p>He looked at the pictures again. &quot;Coulda been a Leard I
guess.&quot; </p>

<p>There was some discussion of the fact that the family
genealogy is, shall we say, <i>subject to interpretation</i>.
Some went so far as to state that Don Morris is not, strictly
speaking, a blood relative and, therefore, it is not necessary to
claim him, despite his obvious achievements. I feel that he must
be included, if only because he has infested an unusually large
portion of the family and he seems to show up at the slightest
mention of free food. There are, however, larger issues involved.
</p>

<p>Over the years, the Richardson-Taylor clan has acquired
members by a number of different methods, including adoption,
acquisition by marriage, friends who just kept hanging around,
(on a few occasions) actual &quot;legitimate&quot; births, and
from other causes far too complicated to explain in ten or twelve
pages. This can sometimes be confusing to children and others who
are not fully acquainted with the difference between admitted and
actual history. </p>

<p>I remember when I was growing up I used to ask my mother
questions like, &quot;What relation is David Leard to me?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;He's your first cousin,&quot; she said. </p>

<p>&quot;Are you sure?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Sure. Just check the tag on his ear.&quot; She handed me
a code book from the Department of Fish and Game. </p>

<p>&quot;What is Steve Morris to me?&quot;<br>
&quot;He's your first cousin, too.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Are all the Morrises my first cousins?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;In general they are. There are a few exceptions, but
those are purely on scientific grounds.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;What is Laurence?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Laurence is best avoided,&quot; she said. </p>

<p>&quot;That's common knowledge,&quot; I said. &quot;But what
relation?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Oooooh, he's just some kind of relative or other.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;But what kind? Cousin? Uncle? Great-aunt? What?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I'm sure that he is at least one or more of those,&quot;
she said. &quot;Otherwise, it would be easier to get rid of
him.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Well, then, what about Ruthie? What relation is
she?&quot; I asked. </p>

<p>&quot;Do you think it will rain?&quot; </p>

<p>Some of you may have noticed that Mary avoided certain
questions with respect to the family history. I am sure there
must be a good, logical explanation. </p>

<p>Since I started the newsletter, and will some day publish a
family tree, I have been informed that several members of the
family were acquired by means which were, shall we say, not
exactly standard. Let it suffice to say that a large portion of
the family might not pass pedigree standards for the American
Kennel Club. As some of you may know, there is even a branch of
the family which is no blood relation at all, but was acquired
solely because they smelled hamburgers on the grill. </p>

<p>In any event, it shall be my policy to consider any family
member, however acquired, to be on a par with any other family
member who does not have quite so much to explain about their
bloodlines. How you got here (marriage, adoption, or factually
recorded birth) is basically irrelevant so, unless someone
insists, I will not list details of how someone got to be at any
particular branch on the family tree. Nor will I attempt to judge
the relative merits of anyone's lineage. Just take my word for
it, that is who they are represented to be. </p>

<p>See you at the reunion, (with the exception of the <b>low-down,
no-good Richardson individual who lives in Ohio and has never
attended a single family reunion</b>). </p>

<p>Sincerely, </p>

<p>Clifford A. Schaffer</p>

<p>1992 Reunion Details</p>

<hr>

<p><b>When: June 20 &amp; 21, 1992</b> </p>

<p><b>Where: Mooney Grove, Visalia, California</b> </p>

<p>Arbor number 11 </p>

<p>That's really good thinking, Becky -- inviting Don Morris to a
place called &quot;Mooney Grove.&quot; </p>

<p><b>Contribution:</b> The standard contribution is again $8.00
per household, </p>

<p>giving the greatest benefit to those of you who breed like
rabbits. </p>

<p>Those of you who wish to send more may do so. The money goes
into a reunion fund which is used to pay for others who can't
manage it, or it is carried forward to the following year. Becky
says that if you contribute enough money, she will investigate
possible campsites in Rio De Janeiro for our benefit. Send your
cash, check, or small items of jewelry to: </p>

<p>Becky says that it would be helpful to know how many
bottomless pits you will be bringing with you so she can have
some idea how many sides of beef she will need. </p>

<p>Please reply by June 1 to let her know. </p>

<p><b>Bring: </b>Salads, beans (it's OK, it's outdoors - just
stay upwind of </p>

<p>the Leards), desserts, and munchies. </p>

<p>Bring your own beverages and a healthy load of charcoal. </p>

<p>Becky said to bring special dishes, gourmet cuisine, and
something which will &quot;suprise us all.&quot; Please don't. I
don't think she realizes what she is saying. Especially, please
don't bring anything you found in the park. </p>

<p><b><u>How to Get There and Other Notes</u></b> </p>

<p>Becky has chosen Visalia for this year's reunion. As you can
see from the enclosed sheet, it is the &quot;Jewel of the
Valley&quot;. Some of you may recognize it by other names. She
says she chose it because it is the only place in the area with a
low to moderate amount of gunfire in the city parks. </p>

<p>Here is Becky's description of how to get to <b>Mooney Grove:</b>
</p>

<p>To get to <b>Mooney Grove</b> in Visalia, take the Hwy 198
exit off Hwy 99. You will be turning east and the exit signs will
indicate Visalia/Sequoia National Park. You will drive right past
the majority of the motels as you head into town. Five miles
after you exit Hwy. 99 and are now heading east on Hwy. 198, take
the <b>Mooney Blvd.</b> exit and turn right (south). After
crawling about five miles through all the traffic, there will be
a little open space and on the left (east) side will be <b>Mooney
Grove</b>. </p>

<p>There is an alternate route to get to <b>Mooney Grove </b>without
using the heavily trafficked <b>Mooney Blvd</b>. Take the
Tagus/Ave. 264 exit east off Hwy 99 (this will be south of the
Hwy 198 exit by 6 miles), continue east on Ave. 264 until <b>Mooney
Blvd</b>. where you will turn left (North). <b>Mooney Grove</b>
will be on your right (east) real soon. </p>

<p>What do you think the Morrises will be thinking about by the
time they get there? Let's just hope they don't get out of hand. </p>

<p>Becky says this place is a county park (not unlike the place
where some of you may be residing) with lots of tall trees,
grass, kiddie play areas, and a duck pond where the Leards can
grab an occasional snack without bothering the rest of us. About
forty miles east of Visalia is the entrance to Sequoia National
Park. You may want to plan to visit Sequoia during your trip. </p>

<p>We have a large covered arbor -- <b>number 11, on the left
after you enter the park</b> -- reserved for both days. There are
electrical outlets on the site so you all can bring you favorite
appliances. Mooney Grove has a $2.00 per vehicle entrance fee.
There is NO parking around the outside of the park. Those who
wish to save money and/or help relieve the parking gridlock
within the park will need to leave extra vehicles and form car
pools at the shopping center north of the park, or at lodging
sites. Of course, if you just hitchhiked down for the free
hamburgers - even better. </p>

<p>In keeping with tradition (tradition? When did we ever have
any tradition beyond petty theft?) we will slaughter the fatted
calf around noon and put bowls out for the Morrises and the
Leards. We will have an early dinner on Saturday to try to get
their bellies full before the sun goes down. </p>

<p>There are two RV campgrounds nearby and campers need to
reserve early as this area gets very busy with folks traveling to
and from the National Parks. </p>

<p>Motelers have a good variety of choices. Most of the motels
are along Hwy 198 between Hwy 99 and Visalia proper; these are
recommended. (Apparently Becky has some considerable experience
with them.) There are also motels on Mooney Blvd. Mooney Blvd. is
the main commercial strip complete with six lanes of heavy
traffic , all stop and go due to frequent traffic lights . This
is also where the cruisers cruise. At one time, Visalia was
planned as the site for the movie <i>American Graffiti,</i> until
the producers decided to go to the more exciting town of Modesto.
</p>

<p>The Visalia KOA has a full range of sites offering no services
(comparable to home) to full hook-ups and tent areas. It appears
to be clean and well-maintained. Amenities include a pool, game
room, and a small playground. Becky says she was quoted $16.65
for full hook-ups. Reserve early, their busy season starts in
April. See the enclosed sheets for location map and campground
layout.</p>

<h1>Richardson-Taylor Reunion News</h1>

<p>December 1, 1992</p>

<hr>

<p>Merry Christmas! The annual family reunion has come and gone
again. I believe it is caused by a chemical imbalance in the
brain. </p>

<p>Well, for all of you who attended the reunion this year, you
know that Becky and Carl put on one of the better feeds of the
past few years. There was some really good steak, and everybody
brought a lot of other fixings which, luckily, we did not have to
share with any of the lower creatures such as Bill Henry. All in
all, I would say it was successful. Only a couple of people took
shots at me, and both of those were deflected. Becky, being the
gracious hostess that she is, offered to help them reload, but
cooler heads prevailed. </p>

<p>When we got to the reunion, Meta came running out to meet us.
I am a good bit faster than she is, so I kept a good distance
between us until I was sure she was in a good mood. I am sure you
will understand when I tell you that the sight of a smiling
relative fills me with mixed emotions. I never know whether they
are genuinely glad to see me, or just anticipating the pleasure
of killing me. Meta is an especially dangerous relative because
she works at the Internal Revenue Service where she is the
manager of Torture Chamber Number 3. She says that it is against
the rules for her to look up any particular person's taxes, which
helps to establish her alibi when you are suddenly picked for an
audit. Beware of anyone who claims innocence before your bad
luck. </p>

<p>As usual, Bill Henry did not show up for the umpteenth year in
a row. As you all know, I have no interest in trashing his
reputation, even if such a thing was possible. Therefore I shall
try to report only the most favorable things I heard about him. </p>

<p>There were signs that Bill Henry would show up, but it turned
out to be a false alarm -- somebody ran over a skunk. Bud was not
fooled, he knew right away it wasn't Bill Henry. </p>

<p>&quot;Ain't nearly as pungent as Bill Henry,&quot; he said.
&quot;You'd have to have whole carload of skunks before I'd think
Bill Henry was coming.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Now Bud,&quot; Louise said, &quot;I think you're going
to offend some skunks with that kind of talk.&quot; </p>

<p>As it turned out, nobody had anything nice to say about this
low-down individual. Even Louise Leard, who normally comes to his
defense, had to admit that Bill Henry and soapy water had never
been close companions. &quot;You have to remember that it is not
really his fault that he has never attended a single
reunion,&quot; she said. &quot;it is just that he is so obese now
that he takes up two first-class seats on the airplane. He has to
steal an awful lot to get that much money.&quot; </p>

<p>Ruthie tried to apologize for him. &quot;I heard he tried to
come but his kids couldn't make it through the farm animal
quarantine.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Talking about farm animals,&quot; Pete said,
&quot;Living with Bill Henry was kinda like living with a grand
champion Berkshire hog that eats nothing but chili beans.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Now, be careful there,&quot; Louise cautioned him.
&quot;You might offend some Berkshire hogs that way.&quot; </p>

<p>Don said the worst things about Bill Henry. &quot;Me and Bill
Henry are buddies,&quot; he said, &quot;like two peas in a pod.
Bill Henry always looked up to me as a model of refinement and
fine behavior. Of course, he never was quite the gentleman that I
am.&quot; Don was right about that. Bill Henry never was a high
society character like Don, and was not nearly as good-looking,
either. </p>

<p>I called Bill Henry, just to see if he had any kind of
miserable excuse for missing every single reunion that has ever
been held. He was his usual weasel self. He told me that the most
recent lewd conduct charges were all a mistake, because he was
only holding it for a friend. </p>

<p>He told me he was coming to California in December to see some
woman named Nasa. He said Dawn knew nothing about it and tried to
get me to believe that he and all his family are doing well. Mark
is either in college or in jail, and Craig is in his senior year
in high school and will soon be eligible to be tried as an adult.
Dawn, he says, was recently arrested for a long string of
unsolicited good deeds. Bill says he has been doing a fair amount
of running in 5K races lately and soon hopes to run a
sub-15-minute mile. He became concerned about his physical
condition when some old lady ran him down and took her purse
back. </p>

<p>As usual, he gave me the mealy-mouth pretty bad about coming
to the reunion. He said he would try but he could not promise
anything. (His wife hears that a lot.) He said he wanted to make
up for his thoroughly disgusting behavior, so he told me to tell
everyone that he would give one hundred dollars to every person
who calls him <u>collect</u> to remind him to come to the
reunion. He said to be sure to call between the hours of midnight
and 2 AM, California time. If he seems a bit irritable when you
call, just hang up and try again in ten or fifteen minutes. </p>

<p>James and Edna were there in fine form, and James spent a good
deal of time telling me about one occasion when he did not go to
jail even though, by his own admission, he thoroughly deserved
it. </p>

<p>Don Morris was there. More than anything else he reminds me of
a mountain gorilla with a good beer gut, wearing Frisco jeans and
a long-sleeved shirt, desperately trying to pass for human. You
have to give him credit because sometimes he almost makes it.
Elinor came along, too, with no unrealistic expectations about
Don's behavior. Jeff did not come along. Elinor explained that he
slipped his collar and ran off to Sacramento. Elinor does not
attend all that many reunions but it must be stated that her
attendance record is a thousand times better than Bill Henry's. I
heard that Don was sick with a heart problem earlier this year
and, on one occasion, he actually passed on for a short time. The
Lord, however, saw Don knocking on the pearly gates, thought
better of His actions, and immediately sent Don back. Don says I
&quot;appreciate&quot; him. I suppose that is one way of putting
it. I guess the Lord does too. </p>

<p>Joanne was there with her new granddaughter. It looks as if
Christy's attempts to breed Andy have been successful. Their
daughter is an absolutely stunning child, a fact which can be
confirmed by anyone who had the misfortune to wander too close to
Joanne's new cub. I would send you all a picture of her but the
only picture I got shows Joanne proudly displaying her in the
Morris Moon position, and you have all seen that before. Her
Grandpa Don is justifiably proud. </p>

<p>Pete and Sandy were there. Pete says I should go talk to Gary
in Oregon. Ruthie says that she has the highest possible opinion
of Sandy and explained that Sandy is Grade-A Certifiable. I think
we can believe Ruthie on this one. </p>

<p>Ruthie was there but Tom was not. Ruthie explained that, in
less than two years of marriage, Tom had come down with double
pneumonia so she thought it best to leave town while he
recovered. </p>

<p>Louise Leard wrote me a letter in which she told me that she
liked all the parts of these letters that I thought were the
dullest. There is no accounting for taste, particularly in
Louise's case. She says that she enjoys reading them aloud with
the other members of her family. Now that is something I never
even contemplated -- Louise Leard telling fart jokes to her
grandchildren. Maybe she should ask Don to come over and share a
few of his experiences with them. Louise said that she was
pleased to see that I was able to talk about the Leards without
using swear words, because it is so seldom done. </p>

<p>We missed Edith and Louise Taylor at the reunion for the first
time in years. They are usually there every year, except for
those rare occasions when there are rumors that Bill Henry might
show up. The last I heard they were both doing well and making
lots of money. Edith is probably organizing a marathon. </p>

<p>Bud was the clear winner for bringing the most family members
to this reunion. I never thought he was that prolific, but from
the looks of the crowd that he had, he must have been having a
whole lot more fun than I thought. You could tell they were all
related to him, too. They showed up and the food vanished. </p>

<p>Several of you have complained about (among other things) that
I never say anything about myself and my family. Part of this is
due to the fact that I tend to be considerably more refined than
the rest of you (especially the Ohio branch of the family) but,
in deference to the unending stream of complaints about one thing
or another, I shall try. </p>

<p>What can I tell you about my family? You can't really hate
somebody until you marry them. There is no happiness in life that
having children cannot cure. </p>

<p>Serena and Alyssa (the twins) have both graduated from high
school, more or less on time. The Pope has declared it a miracle
and will be erecting a small shrine in front of our house. Alyssa
is now going to the local junior college studying nothing in
particular, and works as a secretary for a real estate appraiser.
Serena has been working full time for the last two years at
Pinkerton Detectives in the Employee Benefits Department, and
will begin college in January. They have matching worthless
boyfriends. </p>

<p>Melissa is in high school, has not been arrested recently
(last thirty days) and had a job over the summer doing telephone
canvassing for a real estate company. Her boss said she was good
at talking on the phone -- a real surprise for all of us. </p>

<p>Courtney is now in junior high school and is wearing the
braces that could have been my new car. Anyone who thinks they
have ever seen stubborn should meet Courtney. For years she has
insisted that one of the Four Tops biggest hits was &quot;I'll Be
Darned&quot;. </p>

<p>Bonnie works at Pinkerton as some kind of manager in the
computer systems department, when she is not home complaining. As
a hobby, they all spend money. </p>

<p>Now, I am sure that all of you with children feel that your
children are a very special brand of idiot. In the majority of
cases, I am sure you are right. That is, you spend a good deal of
time just staring in amazement and shaking your head at the dumb
things they do. Well, so do I, but yours probably don't make it
into the local newspaper. I have enclosed a copy of a news
article which appeared in our local newspaper. </p>

<p>It seems that Courtney (our youngest) was accused of gambling
at school. One of her friends dropped a quarter, so Courtney
picked it up and handed it to her. One of the teachers (a
well-known local nut) saw Courtney do it and assumed that
Courtney and her friend were gambling. Consequently, the teacher
confiscated the money, which was the friend's lunch money, and
said Courtney must come in for Saturday school (their usual
punishment for schoolyard felonies). It was clearly a bum rap
because neither one of them could even accurately describe the
usual technique of gambling, because neither one of them had much
interest in it until they got busted. </p>

<p>We, as parents, took exception to a stupid situation and
protested the matter but, as long as Courtney didn't have to go
to the Saturday school, we were ready to drop it. However, I am
sure the school authorities had no idea they were messing with
Alyssa. </p>

<p>Alyssa is the kind of person who will tell people off just
because they need to be told off. She sort of considers it as a
public service on her part. In fact, she goes out of her way to
find people who need this service. Since we have lived here she
has told off the neighbors, their kids, their pets, the
homeowners association, the gardeners, the security guards, the
mail man, the street sweeper, the sheriff, and the people
building the housing tract next door -- to name a few. Somehow,
an issue always seems to come up which requires her input. She is
often the kind of person who makes you wonder if you can knock
them out with one punch. Alyssa could piss off the Pope. Mother
Theresa would strangle her. I have disclaimed any knowledge of
her on many public occasions. </p>

<p>Alyssa never seems to run short of things that she objects to
and she likes nothing better than a good crusade, so when this
happened to her younger sister she was outraged and vowed to do
something about it. I am not entirely sure why she felt she had
to do something because, on any other occasion, she would
gleefully torment Courtney in any way she could, and I have had
to break up more than a few good fist fights between these two.
If she could have personally arranged for Courtney to attend
extra Saturday schools on any other occasion, I am sure she would
have done it in a heartbeat. I guess the injustice of the
situation was just too much for Alyssa to tolerate. </p>

<p>Alyssa called the local newspaper and reported it to them,
providing them with our correspondence with the school, the name
of the other girl, a few other pertinent facts, and a suitable
amount of righteous indignation. They investigated and published
the enclosed article on page one of the Sunday paper. </p>

<p>As result, the school authorities now eye Courtney with great
suspicion, like Richard Nixon views reporters. No doubt they will
tread lightly when they think of messing with Alyssa, or anyone
who might know her. Their policy of arbitrarily seizing money
from kids has, however, stopped. </p>

<p>As for me, I am doing itinerant computer consulting, some
writing on various subjects, and a good deal of rabble-rousing
for radical organizations such as the American Civil Liberties
Union. I am the only member of the Los Angeles Chapter who is
also a member of the National Rifle Association. Even the ACLU
thinks I am a radical. It makes me feel special to be a misfit
even among the misfits. </p>

<p>My specialty is the legalization of drugs, although I will
willingly engage almost any conservative fool on almost any
subject. As some of you may already know I have spent the last
few years debating everyone from local prosecutors to the Drug
Czars on this issue and, to date, have never lost. The reason I
don't lose is simple enough -- any rational review of the
evidence shows that legalization is a far better approach. Most
of the information I have is really surprising. </p>

<p>Do you know why drugs were originally outlawed? Cocaine was
outlawed because of the fear that superhuman Negro Cocaine Fiends
would drink large amounts of Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola and go on a
violent sexual rampage and rape white women. Caffeine was almost
outlawed at the same time because of the same fear. Police
nationwide switched from .32 caliber to .38 caliber pistols
because, as one police officer put it, &quot;Those cocaine
niggers sure are hard to kill.&quot; Opiates were outlawed
because of racial prejudice against the Chinese, and marijuana
was outlawed as a legal weapon against Mexican laborers during
the Depression. The laws never had anything to do with public
health and safety. </p>

<p>As some of you may know, this year there were three judges
from Orange County who publicly came out and said they supported
legalization of drugs. I have been coaching these judges on how
to debate the subject of drug legalization in media appearances
and there has been more than a little success. In any flat-footed
debate they are just about unbeatable. On one recent radio talk
show one of the judges I am coaching was supposed to debate
Sherman Block, the LA County Sheriff. The morning of the debate,
Sheriff Block announced that he would have to release 20 percent
of all of the prisoners in Los Angeles County because there were
no more jails to hold them. Sheriff Block failed to show up for
the debate and the radio station could not find any official in
LA or Orange County who was willing to defend the criminal laws
against drugs. A recent survey showed that forty percent of all
of the judges in Orange County now support legalization. </p>

<p>(Can you imagine Louise Leard reading this propaganda about
drug legalization to her grandchildren? I'm gonna get scolded for
sure. She already blames me for corrupting her youngest child,
and still watches me warily when I talk to him.) </p>

<p>Attached you will find the latest info on the next reunion.
Pete says there will be more information later, presumably after
he has already collected all the money. </p>

<p>Merry Christmas to all and to all a good night!</p>

                        In the absence of further information from Pete,   
                        we should assume that the contribution will be     
                        the same, $8.00 per household or loosely           
                        organized mob.                                     

<b>Important:</b>              Pete says he needs to know who is coming by        
<b>January 15, 1993</b> in order to reserve the camp      
                        sites.  Reserved camp sites, tents, and trailers   
                        will need to be paid for by April 15, 1933.        


</pre>

<hr>

<p>The campground has camp sites, tents, trailers which may be
reserved on a first-come, first-served basis. The camp sites and
tents each rent for $15 per night, and you may have more than one
tent per camp site. </p>

<p>The trailers rent for $35 per night. The trailers, I am told,
have three beds and will sleep up to six people, depending upon
their degree of familiarity. One bed is an actual bed, another
bed is really a table, and a third is a sofa -- kinda like we all
used to sleep when we lived on Fedora. The trailers are supposed
to be 24 footers with all of the amenities of home. Those of you
who use linens on your bed will need to bring them with you. </p>

<p>Pete says to get your reservations in early because there are
only six trailers and Pete and Laurence have already taken two of
them. Ruthie will probably take another one, so anyone who
doesn't speak quickly is going to be sleeping in the park again. </p>

<p>There is also a clubhouse which serves breakfast from 9 to 10
AM (too early for me) for about two or three dollars per adult
(too rich for most of us). Alternatively, they have large
dumpsters available to feed the Morrises and the Leards. </p>

<p>Additional accommodations are available in the motels in
Turlock eight miles away, for $36 to $44 per night. Pete says he
will supply more information about these later. </p>

<h1>Richardson-Taylor Reunion News</h1>

<hr>

<p>March 26, 1993 </p>

<p>Pete called me with the latest update on the reunion. As he
claimed before, it is being held at the Merced River Resort
which, he further goes on to claim, is a luxurious private resort
and park with numerous amenities such as a swimming pool, spa,
enormous club house, and neighboring nudist camp. They have
breakfast in the morning for a nominal fee and kids can eat for
half price. He says that it is so good that they guarantee good
weather. He also says that there are lots of things in the area
such as the Museum at Castle Air Base, the Musuem of Merced
County, some sort of Pioneer Exhibit, and the Yosemite Wildlife
Area. </p>

<p>Doug Leard wrote to commend me on my &quot;internecine
approbation.&quot; (Douglas is sometimes excessively
sesquipedalian.) He went on to say that I should spread some more
of that condemnation on other people in the family, besides the
lower-grade Ohio member, such as Robert and Richard Morris, whose
combined attendance record is nil and seldom. Robert is now
living in Florida and I am of the belief that it is not good
policy to encourage any Morris to come out of a swamp. Richard
last attended at one of the Santa Cruz reunions where he got too
close to the campfire and burned his fur pretty badly. I hear
that he still has a large bald spot on his back and is still
shaken up by the experience. </p>

<p>Bud wrote to say that he has a new great-grandson named (of
all things) James Richardson, born January 23, 1993, weighing in
at seven pounds, eleven ounces, and 21.5 inches long. As usual,
Bud took more credit for this event than any three people would
have deserved, and says that one of his grandchildren played some
minor role in helping to bring this about. We certainly
congratulate him but I think that, in view of the historical
record, his parents might have been more judicious in their
choice of a name. </p>

<p>I have heard that Edna took a nasty fall and broke her leg
pretty badly. She did not explain why she chose to do this, I
would think that she would have wanted to avoid it. Anyway, I
also heard that she seems to be recovering pretty well now but
may still have a slight limp when she gets to the reunion. I was
sorry to hear about her getting hurt but I have to admit that I
am glad of any advantage I can get whenever she starts chasing me
(her favorite nephew) around the table with a butcher knife. </p>

<p>Alyssa, our eldest, appeared on the television game show,
Scattergories, at the end of February, and will soon be appearing
again on April 19 or 20 because they screwed up the scoring the
first time. She has completed her schooling to become a real
estate appraiser and will soon be taking the licensing test. If
she passes the test, she will probably become the youngest
certified real estate appraiser in the state of California. </p>

<p>Melissa took some career aptitude tests for high school and,
overall, scored higher than the school administrators had ever
seen before. In fact, they said that she was probably qualified
to become a research scientist, if she chose. (This is the same
girl whose head whistles when the wind blows.) They said she
scored off the top of the scale on one particular aptitude -- the
ability to talk. That was a great surprise to all of us. </p>

<p>Now to raise the hackles of a good number of you. The years of
Fascist dictatorship under Reagan and Bush has finally overcome
my political apathy and I have resolved to do something about it.
I had hoped that Bill Clinton would make some major changes on
some issues but he appears to be wimping out, so he will probably
have to be pushed. </p>

<p>I am opposed to abortion, for example, but feel that there are
better ways than criminal laws to prevent or dissuade people from
having them. As in many other areas, the use of the police to
enforce essentially private behavior does not add any real
benefit to the equation. </p>

<p>Clinton appears to have wimped out on the issue of gays in the
military, too. The fact is that there have been gays in the
military since the days of Achilles and Patrocles. There were gay
guys in my Army Intelligence unit in Korea and they did not seem
to be a disruptive influence, except to those people that I
thought were a disruptive influence. They had the same kind of
hysterical talk about disorder in the barracks when they were
going to racially integrate the armed services. It was balderdash
then and it is balderdash now. </p>

<p>As I told you, I have been involved in a campaign to
decriminalize drugs. I don't want to get too political here, but
we have people in this family who have suffered greatly, and
continue to suffer, because of a terribly misguided war against
drugs. Aside from the political aspects, this is an issue which
has directly affected this family. Because of some recent events
in the family, a few more of you have come around to my way of
thinking and specifically asked to hear more of what I had to say
about the issue. Therefore, I have enclosed some of the
literature I have put together on the issue. I encourage you all
to go to the library and read the evidence. No rational person
can support our current drug policy once they have read the
evidence. </p>

<p>Things seem to be coming to a head on this issue. I have had a
pretty fair number of speeches and debates, including some on the
radio. The most interesting thing was a meeting we held at the
Hoover Institution at Stanford University on February 26. The
meeting was held at the offices of Dr. Milton Friedman, the
Nobel-prize winning economist, and included some of the most
prominent medical authorities on drugs in the world. Together, we
drafted a resolution calling for immediate public hearings to
form a new drug policy. I have enclosed a copy of the resolution
and a partial list of the people who have signed it. </p>

<p>The resolution was published across the nation. It immediately
received the endorsement of Dr. Dean Edell, and the San Jose
Mercury, and made front-page news in Baltimore and other cities.
In addition, the California Medical Association adopted a
resolution which went even further and openly called for
decriminalization. We are now trying to sign up as many major
prominent people or organizations as we can and, in another
ninety days or so, we will carry the resolution to Bill Clinton
to try to get him to act on it. We have already received a
tremendous response to our announcement and we are anticipating
much more. We believe that, in addition to Baltimore Mayor Kurt
Schmoke, we will soon have the signatures of several more mayors
of major cities. </p>

<p>I have to say that the meeting was intensely interesting.
There were nine doctors in attendance, including the American
doctor who formed Britain's drug treatment plan in 1947, and the
doctor who was appointed by the state legislature to head
California's Research Advisory Panel on Drugs. All of the doctors
agreed that medical patients are suffering unnecessarily because
the war on drugs has limited doctors' ability to provide pain
relief. Dr. Harvey Rose spent three years and more than $100,000
fighting charges that he gave too much Darvon to a woman who was
in her 80's and had crippling arthritis. The war against drugs
has gone so far overboard that doctors cannot prescribe adequate
pain relief, even for people who are desperately ill. </p>

<p>I described to them the medical problems of a few members of
the family and they all agreed on the one thing that they would
prescribe for severe pain -- heroin. They said it was a highly
desireable analgesic because it was safe, powerful, and
short-acting. They all agreed that, for severe medical pain,
heroin is the drug of choice. What was most surprising to me was
that they consistently used the same word to describe all of the
illegal drugs in general, and heroin in particular. The word they
used was &quot;harmless.&quot; Doctors are now coming to
understand that drugs such as marijuana, heroin, and morphine
have very important medical benefits which are not provided by
any other type of drug. Marijuana is the treatment of choice for
conditions such as glaucoma and nausea from chemotherapy. Heroin
and morphine help people heal much faster after severe injuries
or surgery because, by reducing pain, they reduce the stress on
the nervous system. </p>

<p>It is with great regret that I must report that Wilma Taylor
has died. We will miss her.</p>

When:                 <b>June 26 and 27, 1993</b>                               
                                                   
                      Pete says that the party will really start Friday  
                      night, June 25, for all the really hard-core       
                      family members with a campfire, marshmallow        
                      roast, and the traditional Lewd, Obnoxious         
                      Behavior Contest. Pete said that he wanted to      
                      hold the contest on Friday night because there     
                      was a chance that Bill Henry might show up on      
                      Saturday and he wanted other people to have a      
                      fair chance.  He says that ten families are        
                      already signed up for Friday night.                

                      Saturday will be the big day with hot dogs and     
                      hamburgers at noon, the Bill Henry Cursing         
                      Contest at two o'clock, and the main meal about    
                      four.                                              

                      Sunday will be Alka-Seltzer, hotdogs, hamburgers,  
                      and scraps from the carnage of the previous        
                      night, starting at about 11 AM. Some of the truly  
                      hard-core will stay until Monday.                  

Contribution:         <b>$8.00 per household.  </b>                             
Pete says that larger contributions will be        
                      gratefully accepted and will be used to install    
                      an underground beer vat at his home.               
                      Contributions must be in by June 1 and the money   
                      will be all spent by June 21.  As usual, let us    
                      know if money is a problem.                        

Bring:                <b>Salads </b>(for the grazing members of the family),    
<b>beans </b>(here we go again)                           
<b>good desserts</b> (as if anyone in this family would   
                      notice what they were inhaling)                    
<b>charcoal </b>-- at least ten pounds per family.        
                      (Pete did not explain what he wanted to do with a  
                      fire that big.)                                    
<b>drinks </b>(to keep the taylors out of the local       
                      bars)                                              
<b>bathing suits </b>(don't use those same old excuses

                      There will be plastic silverware and plates        
                      provided.  If you need stronger stuff, bring your

Important:            <b>Pete says he needs to know who wants camp sites</b>    
<b>right away.  He said that there were two trailers</b>  
<b>left and they are a fantastic deal.  He says the</b>   
<b>camp sites can have more than one tent, with a</b>     
<b>limit of 8 people per site, so families can share</b>  
<b>a site if they want.  Money for camp sites and</b>

<h1>Richardson-Taylor Reunion News</h1>

<hr>

<p>November 10, 1993 </p>

<p>The Richardsons right before the raid. Nobody of any
importance is missing from this picture. </p>

<p>The Reunion News is coming out a little early for a couple of
reasons. The first is that I got a call the other day from
Laurence. He left a message on my answering machine telling me
that he was going to get &quot;fixed&quot; in January and he
wanted to invite a whole bunch of people to watch. If it is going
to be held in Santa Rosa I may have to pass. He did not explain
much about whether this was some kind of civil or criminal
requirement which had been imposed upon him, or whether he
thought it would just be a fun way to spend the afternoon. </p>

<p>Come to think of it, the tape was not very clear and he could
have said either that he was going to get &quot;fixed&quot; or
that he was going to get &quot;hitched.&quot; I figured the first
was much more likely, and of far greater public benefit, so
that's how I will pass it on to the rest of you. </p>

<p>The second reason I will explain a little later. </p>

<p>As you all know (with the exception of those who have never
attended a single reunion), the last reunion was held on the
Merced River where it was hotter than Hell most of the time. You
could drink all day and never take a leak. </p>

<p>When I arrived a rather strange looking person came running
toward me. &quot;Hi, Cliff!&quot; he said. </p>

<p>I always find it unnerving when eye-witnesses can identify me.
I figured it was best to humor him. &quot;Hi,&quot; I said. </p>

<p>&quot;Do you know who I am?&quot; he asked. </p>

<p>&quot;Stranger,&quot; I told him, &quot;I think you are in the
wrong camp. We don't ask questions like that around here.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I'll give you a clue,&quot; he said, &quot;I'm a
Taylor,&quot; as if that would have narrowed down the field. </p>

<p>&quot;That may well be, but it's nothing to brag on,&quot; I
told him, &quot;and taking your word for it, I would hate to
guess.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I'm David Taylor,&quot; he said merrily, &quot;and I
brung my whole family with me,&quot; apparently not noticing the
look of shock and dread which crossed my face.</p>

<hr>

<p>Don Morris: Redefining handsome</p>

<hr>

<p>I had no reason to believe that this had any relation to the
truth but I decided to accept his story for two reasons. The
first is that it is my standing policy not to question anyone's
tales of how they could be related to the family, no matter how
remarkable the story might be. The second is that I quickly
decided that if anyone wanted to claim to be David Taylor, I
would not dispute him for the honor of it.</p>

<hr>

<p>Pete's explanation for why he is unemployed.</p>

<hr>

<p>He told me how much he liked reading the Reunion News and
assured me that, while some high-falutin' people may have been
offended by some things I said, he certainly was not. He went on
to assure me that he was just as hard to insult as any of the
Morrises, and for pretty much the same reasons. It was a
comforting thought. </p>

<p>He spent the better part of half an hour introducing me to all
the people he had brought with him with the obvious expectation
that I might remember some of them the next time around. I have
made no such effort to remember anyone in the past and no one
should expect that I would make such an effort now or in the
future. It makes no difference in the conversation anyway. From
then on, he would pull me aside every couple of hours to
introduce me to some new &quot;relative&quot; of his (he claimed
that the majority of them were his children, though he was hazy
on more than a few) who had shown up just in time to eat. I
figure that the eight dollar contribution for his household
probably worked out to about ten cents a head. </p>

<p>David Leard and his wife, Pat, were there. She still uses her
maiden name, Lindsey, in order not to be too closely associated
with him. They could be legally attached or just living in sin.
She was suspiciously friendly and I wondered why until she pulled
me aside and slipped me five dollars so I wouldn't say anything
bad about them. The going rate is ten -- each. </p>

<hr>

<p>Laurence under the influence again.</p>

<hr>

<p>Now I am going to tell you something that you probably would
not have believed even if you had been there and seen it with
your own eyes, but they decided that David Leard met the sanitary
standards to host a reunion, and that he and the woman who cleans
his cage would host the next family reunion in some place called
Seattle. I know that some of you will find this hard to believe
but it is cold, hard fact. I can assure you that I had no part in
the transaction and I would have denied responsibility in any
case. The vote was made and carried entirely by the Alzheimer's
crowd, led by Margaret, whose mental state had apparently been
adversely affected by the long drive from New Mexico. Pete went
so far as to auction off fifteen pounds of perfectly good
hamburger rather than cart it up to Seattle for next year.</p>

<hr>

<p>Lunch wasn't quite enough for Richard and Pat.</p>

<hr>

<p>Laurence was there and spent some time telling me that he
agreed with me wholeheartedly on legalizing drugs. &quot;It is
tremendously important,&quot; he said, &quot;that sick people
have a right to pain killers and anesthesia.&quot; He
demonstrated the point by applying a liberal dose of anesthesia
to himself. </p>

<p>As many of you know, Laurence spent some time in the hospital
earlier this year and he says that, because of his emotional
condition after Wilma's passing, the hospital staff labeled him
as being under great stress and therefore allowed him to do
anything he chose. &quot;It was great,&quot; he said, &quot;I
could cuss and scream and kick and rant and rave and piss on the
floor and they wouldn't do nothing. It was just like home.&quot;
Despite his emotional stress he was on his best behavior, so most
of the time he actually left the crowd and went behind a trailer
to relieve himself. </p>

<p>When he was at least a couple of six packs into the
conversation, he got into an argument with Dorothy about
something to do with politics. I don't remember what it was
exactly, and I don't think you could have gotten a clear
explanation from either one of them. </p>

<p>&quot;Laurence, you are a stupid, ignorant, bigoted,
illiterate, and disgusting idiot!&quot; Dorothy told him. </p>

<p>&quot;So what's your point?&quot; he asked. He is among the
quicker of the Taylors. </p>

<p>Louise Leard (my Aunt Polly) was there again. She said that
nothing much new has happened in her life, except that she has a
new pair of stove lids for glasses. They look nice on her. She
says that I should respect her more now that she is a
hundred-and-something (or is it two hundred-and-something?) years
old. I told her that if she had gotten to be that old she should
stop expecting miracles. I am quite sure that some day Louise
will be just as old as she always wanted to be. </p>

<p>Ruthie and Tom were there but Tom spent most of Saturday in
the trailer. Ruthie explained to me that he was laid up because
of something that had happened between them the previous night.
This was no great surprise to me and I would tell you what it
was, but there are some things that I prefer she didn't share
with me.</p>

<hr>

<p>Ruthie spent the weekend burglarizing cars.</p>

<hr>

<p>James and Edna were there and Edna was sporting the latest in
orthopedic appliances for her broken leg. She is doing better
than anyone would have a right to expect after such an injury
(she really did it good when she did it) although she passed up a
perfectly good chance to get several cartons of pain-killers and
other mind-altering drugs. She claims she likes it better that
way. Not me. I want morphine for paper cuts. </p>

<p>Since the reunion there have been a number of interesting
developments on the drug legalization front. Judge James P. Gray
and Joseph McNamara presented the resolution to Dr. Lee Brown,
the current drug czar at a dinner meeting on August 4. The Drug
Policy Foundation in Washington has picked up the resolution as a
cause. They have already printed it once in their newsletter and
will soon print it again as a tear-out page that people can send
it to Clinton. Federal Judge Jack B. Weinstein wrote a major
article about the resolution in the July 8 NY Times, it has been
on Nightline, in Newsweek, in High Times, and has received lots
of other media coverage. Dr. Dean Edell mentions the resolution
about once a month on his radio show and Hugh Downs has done two
shows in which he has mentioned the resolution and quoted
directly from the things I have written. (Oddly enough, he chose
the only facts in my little booklet which I cannot directly
support with actual statistics. For example, he used my line
that, &quot;More Colombians die from American tobacco than the
number of Americans who die from Colombian cocaine.&quot; I don't
have any actual statistics for that one, although there is every
reason to believe it is true.) We have received literally
thousands of signed resolutions from all over the world,
including Australia, Italy, the Netherlands, England, and other
places. </p>

<hr>

<p>Unlike Bill Henry, David Taylor scrounged up the cash to make
bail and came to the reunion.</p>

<hr>

<p>In one of the more interesting events, I appeared on the Mo
Gaffney show (an Oprah-type talk show) against William Von Raab.
Mr. Von Raab is the former Customs Commissioner under Reagan and
Bush and the father of the &quot;Zero Tolerance&quot; program
where they confiscated millions of dollars worth of property
under the pretext that a marijuana seed was found. He quit the
Bush administration because he thought they were not tough enough
on drugs and has been one of the biggest campaigners for tougher
sentences and bigger prisons. James would love him. I had been
waiting years to get somebody like him in front of an audience
where they could not run and could not hide. </p>

<p>To make a long story short, I beat the snot out of him for an
hour and he caved in and gave up. I did not even give him a break
during the commercials. At the end of the hour he signed the
resolution calling for an objective commission to rewrite our
drug policy and admitted to me that he did not know anything
about drugs and, therefore, was not qualified to speak on drug
policy. He also told me that our previous Drug Czars, William
Bennett and Bob Martinez, knew even less about drugs than he did,
so there was no way they could have been qualified for their
jobs, either. (His words.) I do not believe that he will ever try
to speak out on this issue again. </p>

<p>As a result of the resolution, on September 20, a bill was
introduced into Congress, H.R. 3100, The National Drug Control
Policy Act of 1993, by Representative Don Edwards of San Jose.
This bill calls for a thirteen-member commission to review and
rewrite our national drug policy, based on an objective
evaluation of the evidence. Five members of the commission would
be appointed by the President, and four each by the Senate and
the House of Representatives. Currently elected or appointed
government officials would not be allowed as members of the
commission. The bill is being supported by the Drug Policy
Foundation, the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana
Laws, Families Against Mandatory Minimums, and others. I urge
everyone to write to your elected officials and support H.R.
3100. </p>

<p>Anyway, I told you there is another reason why the reunion
news is coming out early this year. It is because David Leard has
put together the plans for the next reunion and, assuming
everyone agrees to it, it will be necessary to notify the place
where it will be held by November, 1993. So you all have to
respond fairly quickly to let him know. </p>

<p>So here is David Leard's proposal for the next reunion,
recited verbatim, with only minimal comments on my part. </p>

<p>First, he wants to hold it at a place called the &quot;Icicle
River&quot; in Washington. Pretty inviting, huh? Bring your
bathing suit and watch your body pucker. I guess he thinks that
is the only way he could top Becky after she invited the Morrises
to <b>Moon</b>ey Grove. </p>

<p>Here is what David had to say. Some corroborating
incriminating evidence is also enclosed. </p>

<p>Because of the distance folks will have to travel, they won't
be able to bring food as they normally do for the California
reunions. That limited choices to places which could provide food
at reasonable cost, provide activities, have camping nearby and
be beautiful (not hot and dusty) We have chosen Mountain Home
Lodge in Leavenworth, WA as the main location for lodging and
meals. There are many activities available here. </p>

<p>Those who are driving or camping can plan on going straight to
the Lodge or rv/camping area described below. If you are flying
into SEATAC airport, you will have to rent a car to drive to
Mountain Home Lodge. You will need a map of Washington. Detailed
directions to come later should there be enough interest. </p>

<p>Mountain Home, Tel.(509) 548-7077, is a destination vacation
lodge just outside Leavenworth, WA, approximately 2-2 hours
drive from SEATAC and Seattle. We have arranged to have the
entire lodge if we can book enough rooms in advance. Tentatively
planned for weekend of Friday/Saturday, June 24, 25, Sunday
optional. We would have to reserve for Friday and Saturday nights
and anyone wishing more nights could do so. (rate sheet enclosed)
The cost for entire lodge is $892 for lodging of 18 people, 24
maximum. There are eight (8) rooms, each accommodating one to
three people. Rates range from $88 to $118 per night for two
people. An addition person in a room is $15 more. A buffet dinner
on Friday and Saturday would cost $15 per person, per night,
Continental Breakfast is $3.50 ea. and big breakfast is $8.25.
(Their continental breakfast is quite good and the regular
breakfast is more than ample). Lunch is $6.00; usually soup,
sandwiches, lemonade, cookies. </p>

<p>In order to guarantee that we are not sharing the loge, we
have to let them know by November. If we don't fill the lodge, we
could still use it as a base, but other guests would be there
also. That could mean younger children would not be allowed in
main lodge accommodations, but OK for day visits. i.e., children
and pets normally not accepted at lodge. The accommodations are
much better than average and the food is always good. The owners
are friendly and willing to work with us on the menu. Usually
dinner is BBQ salmon or steaks, done outside main lodge. Lots of
activities, including: hiking, horseshoes, volleyball, tennis,
swimming in the pool, and a hot tub located just off the large
main deck. Lots of things to do. </p>

<p>There is the &quot;best RV Park I have ever seen&quot; just a
few miles from the lodge. The Icicle River RV Park, 7305 Icicle
Road, Leavenworth, WA 98826. Tel. #(509) 548-5420 They are closed
during winter, open in April, a Good Sam Park, with 10% discount
for Good Sam members, AAA, Golden Age (62), and when taking 5
unites or more, other discounts apply, please inquire if
interested. Rates are: $22.50 per day for full hook up; $15.50
per day for tent space. These rates apply to two people per unit.
It's very clean, with facilities for laundry, showers, etc. They
are the kind of place that fills early in the year, so make
reservations as soon as possible. They do take reservations
during the winter when closed. Keep trying if no answer. </p>

<p>There is fishing right out your back door if you stay at
Icicle River. It's a bit of a drive to Mountain Home from the
park, in the range of 20 -25 minutes because of the road to
Mountain Home. (A bit primitive, slow going, but it is kept in
good shape during most of summer. Can be muddy in spring if snow
melt is slow.) </p>

<p>The Lodge will provide transportation to the Lodge from the
bottom of Mountain Home Road, just outside Leavenworth, but they
charge a fee. In addition, if you are not staying at the Lodge,
they charge a day use fee of $10 per person allowing access to
all facilities at the lodge, this fee is reduced if you include a
meal while there. </p>

<p>We realize this is more expensive than reunions in the past.
Although Margaret volunteered us, we accepted the challenge and
did our best. It was a difficult search because of the summer
demand for recreation and camping in this area. The close-in
spots are taken years/months in advance or lease their best
facilities by the month only and they are all taken. If this
doesn't work for too many people, there is always the option of
returning to somewhere in CA. We will be happy to follow through
with the plan if the OK is given by enough folks to fill the
lodge and others can stay in the camping area. </p>

<p>Well, there you have it. This plan will probably require a
fair amount of decision-making so discuss it all among yourselves
and call David Leard </p>

<h1>Richardson-Taylor Reunion News </h1>

<hr>

<p>February 13, 1994 </p>

<p>David &quot;Bigfoot&quot; Leard wrote to me with a reunion
update, so I thought I would pass it along. </p>

<p>As you all may know, there was something of an earthquake down
here. Some people said it was God's reaction to the thought that
Laurence might reproduce but I take a more charitable view. That
big freeway overpass that collapsed that you saw on TV is about
five miles from where I live, and I go over that exact stretch of
road every morning on the way to work. It woke us up (to be sure,
it woke us up) at 4:30. The whole house was flying around and all
the lights were out, except for the flashes of the explosions in
the distance. We crawled over the junk to get out of our bedroom
and located the kids and they were OK, except that Serena had
gotten buried by falling furniture but was none the worst for
wear. Bonnie evidently got hit in the shoulder by a falling lamp.
That is all we can figure anyway, because she did not notice it
at the time and did not even report any pain until several hours
later. </p>

<p>When these things happens, all the best laid plans go right
out the window. We had bought rechargeable flashlights for years
and had them all over the house most of the time, in addition to
numerous regular flashlights of various types and sizes. In the
first two hours we could not find any of them. After that, the
sun was up. Luckily, however, we did happen to have adequate
supplies of food and drinkable water to last through the next few
days. There were no utilities at all for about 24 hours, then we
got electricity, and two days later we got running water, but had
to boil it or put bleach in it to drink it for about three weeks.
There were people passing out free bottled water all over the
place and the Miller beer company even bottled up a bunch of
water in beer bottles and passed it out, two cases for each
person, for free. </p>

<p>There was a lot of damage to nearly everything. The roads were
buckled all over the place, and some had inch-wide cracks which I
tracked for more than a mile. Water was seeping up through the
pavement from the broken water mains and most of the concrete
block walls I saw had fallen down. There were several buildings
around which suffered severe structural damage and there were
three people that Bonnie works with whose homes were destroyed. </p>

<p>Basically, the whole house was trashed. All of the bookcases,
entertainment centers, and cabinets in the house fell over. The
china cabinet fell on the dining room table and pulverized our
crystal, china, and miscellaneous other collectibles. Every
television in the house was face down on the floor and we lost a
few VCRs and other appliances. </p>

<p>We found out later that the fault ran from Northridge, right
up through the center of Santa Clarita and broke the surface just
a little north of us. Considering the size of the quake and its
proximity to us we were pretty lucky. </p>

<p>The freeway which collapsed was, of course, the only major
road into Los Angeles, so that means, naturally, that there are
huge traffic jams at that point nearly all day long because they
have to steer all that freeway traffic through a bunch of old
surface roads. (Not real good planning, guys!) As a result,
thousands of people who never would have dreamed of taking the
brand-new Metrolink commuter train are now taking it every day.
As fate would have, among this crowd was my eldest daughter
Alyssa. </p>

<p>As a result of the earthquake, Alyssa was on national
television twice in the same day. The second time was when she
got back to the train depot in Santa Clarita on her way home.
When she got off the train, she saw a Channel 7 KABC television
crew and recognized the cameraman as a guy who lives just down
the street from us. They interviewed her about the quake (One of
those typical news interviews -- &quot;You have just seen half
your town destroyed in a few seconds -- how do you feel?&quot;)
and what she was doing to solve her commuting problems. The
interview wound up on the national news feed and was shown all
over the US. </p>

<p>But that wasn't the good one. </p>

<p>It seems that, earlier in the day, Alyssa had been waiting on
the train platform in Burbank and there was a KNBC Channel 4 crew
down there doing a live remote. KNBC was showing the world how
all these people were now crowding into the trains and all the
rest. While this was going on, the train people started making
announcements to the crowd to tell them to move in back of the
yellow line, because the training was coming. Alyssa said the
television lights were in everybody's eyes so they could not
where the yellow line was. So she turned to the cameraman and
asked him, &quot;Would you please turn down the lights or point
them in another direction? Because we can't see where the yellow
line is.&quot; </p>

<p>The cameraman did not respond, so Alyssa tapped him on the
shoulder (she said he was about 6-2, she says she is a full five
feet) and said, &quot;Could you please turn down the lights or
point them in another direction? We can't see the yellow
line.&quot; </p>

<p>The cameraman did not respond, so Alyssa stuck her hand in
front of the lens and said, a little louder this time,
&quot;Would you please turn down the lights or point them in
another direction?&quot; </p>

<p>At that point, the cameraman grabbed her hand and twisted it
away rather roughly which hurt her, so Alyssa gave him a few
choice words but the crowd held her back from an all-out assault.
A few minutes later, the camera crew and the dippy newscaster
were looking around for someone to interview and they walked over
to Alyssa to interview her. Alyssa was pissed. </p>

<p>&quot;You want to interview something?,&quot; she said,
&quot;Why don't you interview this finger you almost broke?&quot;
And she presented it to them -- on live television. That's my
little lady. </p>

<p>The earthquake was quite a shaker but equally unnerving is the
fact that ever since the big one we have had other earthquakes, 3
to 5 pointers, several times a day. For the first few days we
were having them every five or ten minutes around the clock. It
made it difficult to sleep because every time you would doze off
another one would come rolling around. It is slowing down lately
though. I can only recall a couple of earthquakes today. </p>

<p>The roads were out, the utilities were out, and the phones
were out so there was nothing left to do but party. A bunch of
Serena's friends came over because our house was in better shape
than their condo and they did not want to be in their condo while
the rock and roll continued. So we all broke out just about
everything drinkable, and barbecued all the fish and meat that we
thought would spoil and partied hardy for a couple of days. It
was a major inconvenience to be sure, but we'll make it. </p>

<p>Anyway, David sent me a letter, reproduced below, which lays
out most of his latest information on the reunion. David always
types his letters on a computer, which makes them very neat. He
is different from Becky who is liable to write her letters across
the face of Ed McMahon to save paper, or Pete who has Sandy write
his letters so there will be no spelling errors, or Joanne, who .
. . . well, we won't talk about Joanne's letters. </p>

<p>Here's the latest on reunion bookings at Mountain Home Lodge.
The Lodge's reservations have gone very well. The rooms at the
Lodge were all booked by January 3. I called them and arranged to
also use one of the owner's cabins. (They call it a cabin, it's
really much more than a cabin.) There were four additional rooms
available, now only three. Bud Richardson reserved one of the
rooms on January 4. </p>

<p>If all the rooms at the cabin are taken, I have the names of a
B&amp;B and two motels in Leavenworth, WA </p>

<p>&quot;Run of the River&quot;, a Bed and Breakfast, just south
of town, views of the river. 1-800-288-6491. </p>

<p>Ritterhauf, Motel, 55 Units, lower cost, with kitchens in some
1-800-255-5845 </p>

<p>Leavenworth Village Inn, newer place, a little more expensive
that Ritterhauf. 1-800-343-8198. </p>

<p>There are other motels in and around Leavenworth, I don't have
specific information on them. I have no new information on the
campground reservations of how they are going. But, this
campground is really not any more expensive than others used in
the past that were in resort areas. The Icicle River RV Park,
7305 Icicle Road, Leavenworth, WA 98826 (509) 548-5420 </p>

<p>Now that the Lodge is filled (and possibly the extra cabin), I
am negotiating with the owners next week (January 15) to
eliminate the day-use fees for family members who will be eating
lunch and/or dinner at the lodge. Drive your own vehicles to the
Lodge and save another few dollars. This will keep the costs
down. In addition, those folks who are flying up to the area, may
be able to share rental car expense by meeting at SEATAC Airport
and driving together to the lodge. There is also the option of
sharing room(s) at the Lodge or the cabin. Another options is
helping out those who are have special financial difficulties
with money from the Reunion Kitty and any contributions from
those willing to part with a dollar or two. Kids will be welcome
now that we have booked the entire lodge. </p>

<p>Kids will be welcome as long as they are kept on chains. </p>

<p>This reunion is a little different from past versions and
proving to be more popular than first thought. Give it a try. But
move quickly, the accommodations are going fast. </p>

<p>After the letter came I got a call from Michael who said that
David had more news so I called him. When I first called he said
he couldn't talk right then because Pat had broken her foot while
trying escape back to her people and he had to go drag her back
into the house before the neighbors saw her, or something like
that. When he called back he told me this tremendously long tale
about how he was out of work because there had been a lot of
securities fraud, and embezzlement, and a couple of liquor store
stick-ups by employees of the firm and the whole thing had been
shut down by various vice squads. He assured me that he did not
steal near as much as the other employees and, therefore,
expected to be able to plea bargain his way out of it. As usual,
I wish him the best and I will attempt to protect his rapidly
deteriorating reputation at every opportunity. </p>

<p>Then he told me that Pete had sent him an ungodly sum of money
which was left over from the hamburger sales at the previous
reunion. He asked me to tell everyone that being poor and
destitute and generally socially undesirable should be no
impediment to attending the reunion. He said that money is
available to help out those who need it. Those who need help
should just ask, he said. I immediately made a suggestion as to
how this money could be most constructively used but David,
thick-headed as he is, did not go for it. </p>

<p>He said also that, because the other paying customers had
canceled all their reservations when they heard that we were
coming, the day use fee has been eliminated, and children will be
granted free run of the facilities, including the deer-hunting
range next door. </p>

<p>For those who have too much common decency too stay with the
rest of the group, David said that he had discovered a KOA
campground half a mile or so away from the road to the lodge, and
a pretty dumpy RV place at the bottom of the hill. He also
mentioned the Linderhof motel and the Icicle Inn, a particularly
inviting place, just from its name alone. He says that the
campgrounds are going pretty fast up there so you better make
your reservations fast or you will be sleeping by the side of the
road as usual. </p>

<p>And now a spot of news for the drug legalizers among you. You
will be pleased to know that our Resolution has recently received
endorsements from, among others, the LA Times, the Mayor of
Minneapolis, the President of the Detroit City Council, a Senator
from Colombia, the entire staff of the San Bernardino County
Probation Department, the entire staff of the Harbor/UCLA Medical
Center, the Berkeley City Council, and every District Attorney in
Rotterdam, The Netherlands, just to name a few. </p>

<p>Judge Gray and I have made numerous appearances on radio and
television down here and we almost never get even a single
opposing phone call. In fact, one of Judge Gray's appearances on
radio brought so many favorable letters that the station decided
to run it again. Two weeks ago we appeared together on a TV talk
show in Palmdale. Prior to the show the producers had arranged
for representatives of the Drug Enforcement Administration, the
District Attorney, and the Sheriff to come on the show and take
the other side. The morning of the show the producers got phone
calls from each of the groups and, when they heard who was going
to be on against them, they all suddenly remembered that they had
conflicting appointments, or could not find a baby-sitter, or
something. The real problem, of course, is that they have been
getting the snot beat out of them every time they showed up. As a
result, the judge and I had about two hours of free TV air time
to say what we wanted. They did manage to find a drug abuse
counselor to oppose us, but he wound up agreeing with us and
volunteered to help with the Resolution. </p>

<p>The major national drug policy organizations such as the Drug
Policy Foundation, NORML, and various other groups are beginning
to see the wisdom in our strategy and have adopted the proposals
I have outlined as their primary strategy. If you were reading
the news lately, you know that Surgeon-General Joycelyn Elders
stated that the issue of drug legalization should be studied.
This remark was a direct result of our Resolution. You may not
know that, in a later interview she referred to some things I had
written (which someone else had sent her) and said that she had
read some of the research on the subject and was more convinced
than ever that legalization should be seriously considered. You
may expect to hear more from her on this subject in the near
future. </p>

<p>H.R. 3100, the bill which calls for a 13-member Federal
commission to study drug policy is alive and well and gaining
sponsors in Congress. Basically, the bill calls for a panel of
thirteen people to be appointed, five by the President and four
each by the Senate and House. The panel is supposed to hear all
of the relevant evidence on drug policy and make a report on the
findings within eighteen months. This is an intelligent,
reasonable approach to solving the drug problem and I hope
everyone will write to their Senators and Representatives and ask
them to support this bill. </p>

<p>We are also producing a television show for local access cable
TV. I don't know if you know it or not, but if you have a
television show that you think ought to be aired, the cable TV
companies are required to show it at no cost to you. (Provided
the content is not obscene, etc.) As a result, we have people all
over the country showing these shows on television. </p>

<p>One of the most interesting shows is on the history of
marijuana. It includes a United States Department of Agriculture
film called &quot;Hemp for Victory.&quot; The film was made in
1942 and encourages farmers to grow hemp (marijuana) because the
US Navy literally could not sail without it. It was so vital to
the US military during World War II that farmers who grew hemp
were exempted from military duty. Prior to 1937, marijuana was
grown throughout the United States in industrial quantities. It
was the primary source of durable cloth such as the sixty tons of
sail and ropes carried by the average large sailing ship, or the
canvas which covered the Conestoga wagons of the pioneers. It was
also the primary source of oil-based fuels, paints, and other
products. &quot;Hemp for Victory&quot; really makes people wonder
how it came to be illegal in the first place. </p>

<p>That's it for now. Call David if you have any questions. <br>

<h1>Richardson-Taylor<br>
Reunion News </h1>

<hr>

<p>December 3, 1994 </p>

<p>Yes, just when you thought you would never hear from any of us
again, it is time to start planning for the next major debacle,
the family reunion of 1995. I did not attend the last reunion in
Washington myself and I understand that the turnout was lower
than any time in recent memory, primarily because of a persistent
rumor that Bill Henry would show up. He did not show up, to the
great relief of everyone in the family and Washington's farm
animals, too. Laurence is the organizer of the 1995 reunion and
says that he has taken steps to have guards posted to prevent
Bill Henry from showing up. Therefore, he says, we will not have
to worry about Bill Henry's ugly mug spoiling any of the group
pictures. He probably would have spent most of his time doing the
Morris Moon anyway. </p>

<p>Laurence, as you all know, is now a married man which just
goes to prove that the laws against such things are not
tremendously effective. He wrote me to tell me that he had been
laid up recently due to a heart bypass operation (apparently the
doctors found that his heart served no useful purpose) and an
operation for a blood clot in his leg. Both of these problems, he
said, were the result of what could be politely described as an
overly strenuous honeymoon, which he related at great length, and
was obviously confused with some things which actually happened
in high school. Men really don't need drugs because they have
women. Barbara, his bride tells a somewhat different story, with
considerably fewer disgusting details. In any event, he says that
he is recovering nicely now and will be just as gross and
disgusting as we all have gotten used to, and even come to
cherish. Like Don Morris, he is something of a gem in his own
right. </p>

<p>I have not been in touch with many of you so I cannot relate a
lot of news about other people. I can assure you it is a great
relief. However, on my own front, some significant things have
happened. As far as my campaign to get our drug laws changed,
there has been more success than we had dared hope. Far too much
has happened, even in the last six months, for me to relate it
all so I will stick to some of the highlights. </p>

<ul>
    <li>Both the California Medical Association and the
        Department of Health and Human Services have issued major
        reports stating that the undertreatment of pain in the
        United States is a major national tragedy. They said that
        narcotics such as morphine are the cheapest, safest, and
        most effective treatments for pain and the reason doctors
        do not prescribe them is because they are afraid of
        prosecution if they do. Both organizations recommended
        that narcotics be used as soon as the patients request
        them and that patients be allowed to control their own
        dose. They both said that the risk of addiction is so
        small that it is of no practical concern. As the
        Department of Health and Human Services said,
        &quot;Addiction (as the result of medical use of
        narcotics) almost never happens.&quot; </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>The head of Interpol, the British Association of Chiefs
        of Police, the Attorney-General of Colombia, and many
        other major law enforcement officials have called for
        either decriminalization or legalization of drugs and it
        is apparent that several law enforcement officials and
        organizations are now mounting a major push to get drugs
        decriminalized in all of Europe. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>There have been two TV specials and several radio shows
        in the last six months which were based at least in part
        on the things I have written, one by MTV which aired in
        September, and another by the BBC titled &quot;The Drug
        War, R.I.P.&quot;, which aired on the Arts and
        Entertainment Channel in September. There will also be a
        one-hour television special coming up on ABC which, I
        understand, will be based largely on the points I have
        made and taught others to make. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Our campaign for a Federal commission to review drug
        policy has been successful. Language establishing such a
        commission was included in the recent Crime Bill, which
        everyone made such a fuss about. In all the hullabaloo
        about banning guns, Representative Don Edwards of San
        Jose was able to slip the language in during the
        Conference Committee and it went unnoticed in the final
        vote, even though a number of members of Congress had
        said they were deadset against it. The commission is due
        to start its work in 1996 and is supposed to issue its
        report by 1998. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>A couple of years ago I published a pamphlet I called
        Persuasive Strategies. The purpose of it was to teach
        anyone how to beat the snot out of drug warriors in a
        debate and do it so completely that there would be no
        question in anyone's mind who won the debate. These
        strategies were probably the primary reason for the
        success of all the things we have done. A lot of other
        people saw them, liked them, and started using them,
        including a lot of fairly famous people. As a result, The
        Drug Enforcement Administration and their allies have
        found that they have been getting their butts kicked
        every time they showed up to discuss the subject in
        public -- all across the nation. They called an emergency
        meeting in August, calling in drug warriors from all
        across the country to discuss what to do about it. <br>
        It must have been an interesting meeting. I can just
        imagine the conversation, &quot;I got my butt kicked in
        LA.&quot; &quot;I got my butt kicked in Buffalo&quot;,
        &quot;I got my ass kicked in Albuquerque&quot; and so
        forth. Unfortunately, they did not invite me or I could
        have given them a few tips myself.<br>
        In order to try to combat what I have been doing they
        have issued a 40 page booklet called &quot;How to Hold
        Your Own in a Drug Legalization Debate&quot; which
        attempts to train their people how to debate people who
        are using my tactics. They even lifted paragraphs from my
        pamphlet and slightly altered the wording. Imitation is
        the sincerest form of flattery. I thought one paragraph
        from their booklet was particularly flattering:<br>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>Legalization proponents are formidable opponents. The group
acknowledged that proponents of legalization are generally
well-prepared and credible people whose arguments, though
compelling, are faulty. Proponents effectively use lawyers and
public relations firms to espouse liberalization of drug
policies.<br>
</p>

<p>Shortly after their booklet was published I got a call from a
publisher asking me to do a book in reply to theirs, which you
should see in the bookstores next year. </p>

<p>But enough about politics. Now we will go on to the sordid
details of the next reunion. </p>

How DARE they! :) </p>

<p> Date: 13 May 1995 05:54:34 GMT </p>

<p> DARE also has a big problem passing misinformation. I've
personally heard them tell kids that recreational drugs are far
more dangerous and KILL more people than alcohol! That's just not
fact... </p>

<p> A few years ago my niece turned her father in for pot after
being interrogated by DARE officers in the principle' s office at
her school in a very small town. My niece claims they told her
that her parents had a </p>

<p> crack problem. She claims all she said was that she knew her
parents smoked pot in college and once she thought she smelled it
at home. Being a small town ... they ran out and got a search
warrant and searched their home and their two adjoining home
businesses a beauty salon and a green house/nursery. After
ripping apart their home and businesses they found nothing! </p>

<p> But the trauma of being told their daughter turned them in
for crack and having their home torn apart with about 6 officers
in front of their neighbors has about destroyed that family and
their businesses. They are reluctant to pursue a lawsuit because
their daughter is involved &amp; they'd like to put it behind
them. </p>

<p> Thanks Dare!. <br>

<h1>A BRIEF HISTORY OF FEDERAL FIREARMS ENFORCEMENT </h1>

<p><b>Frederick S. Calhoun. Ph.D.</b> </p>

<p>Historian </p>

<p>Federal Law Enforcement Training Center </p>

<p>This is Appendix G from the David Koresh Investigation. It is
included because it contains interesting information on the
background of Federal law enforcement. </p>

<hr>

<p>The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) is a
relatively young law enforcement organization, having been
created formally in 1972. Yet, measured by the federal laws
related to the regulation and taxing of alcohol, tobacco, and
firearms-the laws ATF now enforces-the history of the bureau's
duties and responsibilities stretches across the full two
centuries of American history. As early as 1791, revenue acts
taxed both alcohol and tobacco and created the offices of tax
inspector, collector, and supervisor. During the next century,
the offices changed names as frequently as the tax rates changed,
but the federal interest in raising revenues from alcohol and
tobacco remained strong. Indeed, the formal organization of an
independent bureau within the Department of Treasury specializing
in alcohol, tobacco, and firearms law enforcement belatedly
recognized the distinct need for such an agency. </p>

<p>After the Civil War, revenue agents battled moonshiners
throughout the South in some of the bloodiest opposition ever to
federal law enforcement. Revenue agents and deputy U.S. marshals
by the score were killed as they roamed the hills and hollows
searching out illicit stills. Prohibition changed the
government's focus from taxing whiskey to banning it, yet the
revenue agent's job remained as dangerous. After experimenting in
social adjustment a dozen years, Prohibition was rescinded.
Spawned by the 1933 repeal of Prohibition, the Alcohol Tax Unit
was established as a tax-collecting branch within the Internal
Revenue Service (IRS). Continued concern over the violent,
organized mobs that plagued the major cities compelled the
federal government to try to curb the gangsters' ability to arm
themselves. Rather than ban outright the purchase of machine guns
and sawed-off shotguns-the weapons of choice for the
mobsters-Congress in 1934 simply imposed a tax those weapons.
Paying the tax required registering the weapon. The registration
requirement was intended to discourage ownership of such weapons
without outlawing them. No self-respecting gangster would want to
register, much less pay the tax, on his Tommygun. Their evasion
of the tax gave the government another legal tool to use in
arresting the gangsters and breaking up the mobs. </p>

<p>Because it was a tax rather than a prohibition, it fell to
Treasury to enforce the law as part of Treasury's role in
collecting all funds due the government. Within Treasury, the
Alcohol Tax Unit seemed the logical branch to enforce the new
law. Registering and taxing stills required many of the same
procedures and investigatory talents that would be needed to
register and tax weapons. In the end, the new assignment proved
comparatively easy. The unit was not overwhelmed with
registrations nor by the 1940s were the investigations into
evasions of the tax very time-consuming. As the gangsters
declined in number and power, so did their use of machine guns
and sawed-off shotguns. Enforcing the alcohol taxes again
occupied most of the unit's attention. </p>

<p>In 1951, the Alcohol Tax Unit began enforcing federal taxes on
tobacco, thus prompting a name change in 1952 to the Alcohol and
Tobacco Tax Division. Once again, the logic seemed to be that
collecting the tax on tobacco closely resembled the work
necessary to collect the tax on alcohol, machine guns, and
sawed-off shotguns. The 1968 passage of the Omnibus Crime Control
and Safe Streets Act and the Gun Control Act expanded the IRS
unit's jurisdiction to the criminal use of explosives and bombs.
The new laws also defined specific federal offenses involving
firearms, including transportation across state lines and use in
organized crimes. In recognition of this new enforcement
responsibility, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax Division changed its
name to the Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms Division (ATFD). Two
years later, Congress passed the Explosives Control Act defining
certain bombings and acts of arson as federal crimes. It assigned
jurisdiction for enforcing this new law to ATFD. With these
expanded responsibilities. the Treasury Department on July 1,
1972 created the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms under
the general oversight of the Assistant Secretary of the Treasury
for Enforcement, Tariffs and Trade, and Operations. For the past
twenty-one years, ATF has enforced the collection of federal
taxes on alcohol and tobacco and the federal controls and
regulations on firearms, with particular attention to their use
by criminals. </p>

<p>Although on its face the bureau seems a discordant collection
of separate duties, the techniques for enforcing the taxes and
ferreting out the illicit products, whether cases of whiskey,
cartons of cigarettes, crates of automatic weapons, or containers
of bombs, are strikingly similar. </p>

<p>Subsequent laws have expanded ATF's jurisdiction. The 1976
Arms Export Control Act focused the Bureau's attention on
international gun smuggling. The 1982 Anti-Arson Act gave ATF
authority to investigate the destruction of property by fire as
well as by explosives. Increased taxes on cigarettes and alcohol,
and enhanced regulatory measures such as the 1978 Contraband
Cigarette Act, have also enhanced the bureau's responsibility to
ensure the government receives its lawful taxes. </p>

<p>The bureau has been an effective force in law enforcement.
Supplies of illicit alcohol and smuggled tobacco have steadily
decreased, and tax revenues have risen. During 1991, for example,
ATF collected $7.7 billion in alcohol taxes and $4.8 billion in
tobacco taxes. ATF agents have also focused on tracking down
armed career criminals and criminal gang members. Investigations
in Florida resulted in the arrest of 45 Warlock motorcycle gang
members in 1991. Members of the Gullymen Posse, a gang of
Jamaican drug dealers known for its propensity to commit murder,
were arrested in New York by ATF agents in January 1991.
Similarly, an ATF investigation into the activities of the Born
to Kill gang culminated in the arrest of a dozen gang members in
August 1991. Sixteen members of the San Diego chapter of the
Hells Angels were convicted in 1992. As a result of these and
similar investigations, ATF has become the nation's principal
repository for gang-related information and intelligence. </p>

<p>The bureau has also earned an excellent reputation for working
well with federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies. ATF
agents also specialize in identifying anonymous bombers by their
&quot;signature&quot; habits in making bombs. For example, in
1990, the assassin of Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals Judge
Robert Vance was ultimately identified by ATF agents who
recognized the way the bomb was constructed. Similarly, in the
midst of the tragedy in Waco, Texas, ATF agents investigating the
World Trade Center bombing helped to identify the van that was
used to hold the bomb. This early identification led FBI agents
to the rental car company and thereafter to arrests of the
terrorists before they could escape the country. </p>

<p>The bureau has developed considerable expertise in arson
investigations. At the request of the National Fire Protection
Agency, ATF began developing nationwide standards for fire
investigators. The State Department's Diplomatic Security Service
invited ATF to develop a protocol establishing an International
Response Team of investigators trained to search blast scenes
involving U.S. property abroad. Despite a rather eclectic array
of duties, ATF has succeeded in developing considerable expertise
in each area of its enforcement responsibilities. </p>

<p>The raid by ATF agents on the Branch Davidian compound
resulted from its enforcement of contemporary federal firearms
laws. In a larger sense, however, the raid fit within an
historic, well-established and well-defended government interest
in prohibiting and breaking up all organized groups that sought
to arm or fortify themselves. The 1934 law taxing weapons was
only the first time the federal government addressed private
ownership of weapons; it was not the first federal effort to
control firearms. From its earliest formation, the federal
government has actively suppressed any effort by disgruntled or
rebellious citizens to coalesce into an armed group, however
small the group, petty its complaint, or grandiose its ambition.
The collection of large arsenals by organized groups lent itself,
ultimately, to the violent use of those weapons against the
government itself or portions of its citizenry. Indeed, federal
agents who tried to disband the groups frequently became the
targets. </p>

<p>The discomfort over armed organizations predated the
Constitution. </p>

<p>The outbreak of what became known as Shays' Rebellion in 1786
gave added urgency to the establishment of a strong national
government. During the rebellion, hundreds of angry Massachusetts
farmers, most veterans of the Revolution and facing foreclosures
on their farms, banded together to keep the courts from issuing
any executions. Calling themselves Regulators, the farmers
quickly organized into a small army. Significantly, their first
foray was to capture the arsenal at Springfield. Although the
Regulators failed, the specter survived. Five months, delegates
from each of the thirteen states met in Philadelphia to design a
new experiment in government. </p>

<p>The lesson of Shays' Rebellion was not forgotten, even after
the new government was formed. In 1792, Congress passed a law
empowering the president to call out the state militias to
suppress insurrections if either an associate justice of the
Supreme Court or a local district court judge certified that
opposition to the laws was beyond the powers of the civil
authority to suppress. Ironically, the first occasion to resort
to that law grew out of the violent, organized, and armed
resistance to the federal government's whiskey tax. Thus, two of
the duties that ATF would later inherent-enforcing alcohol taxes
and controlling firearms-combusted in 1794 into the Whiskey
Rebellion, the first violent opposition to the new federal
government.[1] </p>

<p>Across the next century, succeeding presidents had sporadic,
though no less fearsome, occasion to dispatch the Army and the
state militias to suppress various outbreaks of armed opposition
to federal laws, taxes. and interests. In 1799, Fries Rebellion
against a federal tax on houses forced President John Adams to
muster the militia. Fugitive slave rescues during the 1850s
prompted the government to call out the military. Organized
resistance in Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, New York, Ohio, and
Wisconsin raised a troublesome specter. &quot;The main
opposition,&quot; President Millard Fillmore warned Congress in
December 1851, &quot;is aimed against the Constitution
itself.&quot; At the end of the decade, John Brown's ill-fated
raid on Harper's Ferry,. Virginia, sparked the government to
decisive action. Brown chose Harper's Ferry because of the
federal arsenal there. His intent was to distribute the weapons
among Southern slaves and lead them in revolt for their freedom.
Federal troops, however, thwarted the plan.[2] </p>

<p>After the Civil War, the federal government battled
unrepentant Southerners to protect the rights of the freedmen.
Nonetheless. federal officials acted only after the innumerable
Klan-style attacks were finally perceived as organized.
&quot;Outrages of various descriptions.&quot; Attorney General
George Williams advised southern U.S. Attorneys and Marshals in
1874. &quot;and in some cases atrocious murders have been
committed in your district by bodies of armed men. sometimes in
disguise and with the view it is believed of overawing and
intimidating peaceable and law abiding citizens and depriving
them of the rights guaranteed to them by the Constitution and
laws of the United States.&quot; The attorney general ordered his
attorneys and marshals &quot;to detect, expose. arrest, and
punish the perpetrators of these crimes.&quot;[3] </p>

<p>Throughout the western territories and along the Mexican
border, the federal government found occasional need to suppress
armed bands of outlaws, ganged together to steal cattle or rob
the mails. General William Tecumseh Sherman. sent to the Arizona
border in April 1882 to investigate the outlaw troubles there,
advised President Chester A. Arthur that &quot;the Civil Officers
have not sufficient forces to make arrests, to hold prisoners for
trial or punish when convicted.&quot; The President promptly
proclaimed on May 31 that the areas plagued by the outlaws were
in a state of rebellion.[4] </p>

<p>The federal government looked no more kindly on the labor
strikes that broke out in the closing years of the nineteenth
century and the opening years of the twentieth. What seemed so
dangerous about events such as the 1894 Pullman strike was not
just the disruption of he mails, which was the legal basis on
which the government relied to break the strike, but the fact
that the mails were being violently disrupted by organized
groups. &quot;We have been brought to the ragged edge of
anarchy,&quot; Attorney General Richard Olney frantically
explained when he ordered that the trains be kept running.
Eventually, Eugene Debs and his colleagues in the American
Railway Union, which took the lead in the strike, were indicted
and convicted. Once again, it was the volatile mixture of
violence and organization-combinations determined difficult to
suppress-that evoked the full power of the federal government.[5]
</p>

<p>The passage of the National Firearms Act of 1934, the first
federal effort to control private ownership of firearms, grew out
of this historic fear of armed organizations. The various
collections of gangsters that proliferated during Prohibition
were the true targets of the law, which required a tax and
registration on the sale of their weapons of choice-machine guns
and sawed-off shotguns. Subsequent federal firearms laws have
been of a piece. Oher than the 1968 ban on mail-order sales,
which was in direct, though delayed, response to the
assassination of President Kennedy, federal gun laws have
typically been concerned with the weapons of considerable
destructive power generally preferred by organized groups-bombs,
machine guns, and automatic weapons. </p>

<p>In recent times, the federal government has shown itself even
less patient with armed groups than it had historically. Radical
extremists of both the Right and the Left have been pursued
aggressively once they began breaking the law. For instance,
after the Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA) launched its
self-styled &quot;people's war&quot; by kidnapping newspaper
heiress Patty Hearst and committing a number of daring bank
robberies, the federal government dedicated its full resources to
tracking the group down. Within approximately three months, FBI
agents and Los Angeles police closed in on the group at a house
just outside what was then known as Watts. During an intense gun
battle and fire, every member of the SLA in the house was
killed.[6] </p>

<p>Gordon Kahl, who stood at the opposite end of the political
spectrum from the SLA, met a similar end. Kahl belonged to the
Posse Comitatus which refused to recognize the authority of any
government above the county level. Accordingly, Kahl consistently
refused to pay his federal taxes, even after he served time in
prison for not doing so. When U.S. Marshals attempted to arrest
him for violating the terms of his probation, Kahl killed two of
them. For the next five months, Kahl hid among his friends and
sympathizers until FBI agents located him in a farmhouse just
outside Smithville, Arkansas. After refusing to surrender, Kahl
was killed, and the farmhouse was burned down.[7] </p>

<p>Robert Matthews, the head of a group of right-wing fanatics
known as the Order, embraced many of Kahl's beliefs. Unlike Kahl,
whose resistance was essentially passive until the marshals tried
to arrest him, Matthews and the Order launched an aggressive
private war against the country. Like the SLA, the Order
committed a series of bank and armored car robberies, netting
$3.6 million in one heist alone. The Order also assassinated Alan
Berg, a radio talk show host in Denver, Colorado. </p>

<p>The FBI began an equally aggressive pursuit. After a brief,
violent skirmish in Idaho and another in Portland, Oregon, FBI
agents finally closed in on Matthews hiding out among three
adjoining houses on Whidbey Island, some fifty miles north of
Seattle. After ngotiating his surrender for two days, Matthews
began firing on an FBI Hostage Response Team that attempted to
enter the house. Protected by a full suit( of body armor,
Matthews ran from the first floor to the second floor firing
automatic weapons. The FBI dropped a magnesium flare from a
helicopter. The flare landed on the roof of the house and burned
through it to the room where Matthews had stored his ammunition
and explosives. These ignited, setting off a roaring, exploding
fire that consumed Matthews.[8] </p>

<p>A year later, in the spring of 1985. ATF collected
considerable evidence that an 80-member group styling itself the
Covenant of the Sword and the Arm of the Lord (CSA) had
stockpiled a large arsenal at its fortified compound in Arkansas.
The group had collected over 150 firearms, (including 35 machine
guns), two anti-personnel mines, three anti-aircraft rockets, 50
pounds of military plastic explosives, 300 blasting caps, 2,000
feet of detonating cord, and around 100 explosive devices. CSA
had also stockpiled food, water, and supplies. TF led the assault
on the CSA compound on April 20, 1985. CSA members retreated
farther into the compound, barricading themselves behind their
defenses. The agents set up a siege perimeter and settled in to
wait. The group used the wait to destroy many of the weapons (and
hence evidence) illegally obtained. Negotiators from the FBI
arrived and began the tedious, frustrating process of talking the
group out. Three days later, on April 22, 1985, James D. Ellison
and the 75 members of the CSA surrendered.[9] </p>

<p>As both history and recent events clearly show, the United
States has never tolerated armed groups residing within its
borders. The intent of the particular organization, whether
ideological or criminal, mattered little. If the group was
building an illegal arsenal, the group was subject to a federal
enforcement action. To this day, ATF's enforcement focus retains
the flavor of that historic concern with armed organizations. The
agency has developed considerable expertise and success in
investigating the activities of motorcycle, street, and drug
gangs, all of which share in common a proclivity to amass large
arsenals of powerful weapons. The raid on the Branch Davidian
compound occurred in the context of that historical background. </p>

<p>This Department of Justice report was a search and summary of
all of the existing evidence on the relationship between drugs
and violence. The report found that alcohol was the only drug
which had any real connection to drug-induced violence. Nearly
all of the violence associated with illegal drugs was a result of
the fact that the drugs are illegal, not as a result of
pharmacological effects. </p>

which are misleading, to say the least, when compared with the
full text of the reports. Readers of these reports should read
them carefully to determine the difference between the press

<p> CHAPTER 1 </p>

<p> INTRODUCTION </p>

<p> Drug Abuse Resistance Education (D.A.R.E.) is currently the
Nation's predominant school-based drug prevention program, and
both its prevalence and popularity continue to expand. The
D.A.R.E. program, designed to prevent students' use of tobacco,
alcohol, and other drugs, uses trained, uniformed police officers
in the classroom to teach a highly structured curriculum.
Developed by the Los Angeles Police Department and the Los
Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) as a collaborative
venture, the primary or core D.A.R.E. curriculum is directed
toward pupils in the final grade of elementary school (usually
grade 5 or 6). Additional curricula for students in kindergarten
through fourth grade, junior high school, senior high school, and
for parents have been developed and implemented. </p>

<p> Purpose of the Study </p>

<p> D.A.R.E.'s popularity, as demonstrated by the extraordinary
growth in its rate of dissemination and by abundant anecdotal
reports of its success, is self-evident. In part because of its
preeminent position, policymakers, researchers, educators, and
parents are asking a number of fundamental questions about the
program: </p>

<p> o How effective is D.A.R.E. in preventing drug use? </p>

<p> o What are D.A.R.E.'s effects compared with those of other
school-based drug prevention programs? </p>

<p> o What are some of the basic features common to most D.A.R.E.
programs? </p>

<p> o Who usually manages the D.A.R.E. program? </p>

<p> o How extensively is D.A.R.E. implemented nationwide? </p>

<p> o How do other alcohol and drug prevention programs compare
with D.A.R.E. and D.A.R.E. with them? </p>

<p> To address these and other questions, the National Institute
of Justice (NIJ) awarded the research team of the Research
Triangle Institute (RTI) and the University of Kentucky's Center
for Prevention Research (CPR) a grant to conduct an extensive
review of the D.A.R.E. program and to assess its place within the
context of the broad spectrum of school-based drug prevention
efforts. </p>

<p> Study Objectives </p>

<p> The research team proposed and carried out two distinct types
of assessments, the first pertaining to implementation and the
second to outcomes or effectiveness. The primary objectives of
the implementation assessment were to </p>

<p> o assess the organizational structure and operation of
representative D.A.R.E. programs nationwide; </p>

<p> o review and assess factors that contribute to the effective
implementation of D.A.R.E. programs nationwide; and </p>

<p> o assess how D.A.R.E. and other school-based drug prevention
programs are tailored to meet the needs of specific populations. </p>

<p> The first two objectives for the implementation assessment
relate exclusively to D.A.R.E. The third targets D.A.R.E. but
also includes other drug use prevention programs. </p>

<p> The primary objectives of the outcome assessment were to </p>

<p> o identify all outcome evaluations of D.A.R.E.'s core
curriculum conducted to date in the United States and Canada; </p>

<p> o assess the methodological rigor of those evaluations; </p>

<p> o examine the nature and extent of the effects of D.A.R.E.'s
core curriculum; and </p>

<p> o compare the effectiveness of D.A.R.E.'s core curriculum
with that of other school-based drug use prevention programs
targeting 5th- and 6th-grade pupils. </p>

<p> Although the first three objectives of the outcome assessment
focus exclusively on D.A.R.E., the fourth places D.A.R.E. in a
larger context by comparing it with other drug prevention
programs. </p>

<p> In this report, we synthesize the most important findings
from both of the assessments and present overall conclusions, and
some recommendations. </p>

<p> Description of the Study </p>

<p> To achieve the study's goals and objectives, the research
team designed a set of research strategies that would yield data
pertinent not only to a review and critique of D.A.R.E., but also
to an assessment of how D.A.R.E. compares with other school-based
drug prevention programs, and of future directions for these
programs. </p>

<p> For the implementation assessment, we collected original data
by conducting </p>

<p> o informal interviews and discussions with the coordinators
and/or educational advisors of D.A.R.E.'s Regional Training
Centers (RTCs); </p>

<p> o a survey of State D.A.R.E. coordinators; and </p>

<ul>
    <li>a survey of drug prevention coordinators in a
        representative, stratified sample of school districts
        that included districts with and without D.A.R.E. </li>
    <li>We also conducted site visits to two pairs of schools
        (one school in each pair had D.A.R.E. and the other did
        not). We discuss the methodologies used for each
        component of the implementation assessment in Section II
        of this report. </li>
</ul>

<p> For the outcome assessment, the research team conducted a
review and assessment of the published and unpublished
evaluations of D.A.R.E.'s core curriculum conducted to date. We
collected no primary data, but instead studied prior D.A.R.E.
evaluations using meta- analytic techniques. The methodologies we
used for the outcome assessment are presented in Section III of
this report. </p>

<p> At the conclusion of our data collection and analysis
efforts, the research team joined Tom Colthurst of the University
of California at San Diego Extension Program in March 1993 to
host a conference in San Diego, California, titled
&quot;Evaluating School-Linked Prevention Strategies Alcohol,
Tobacco, and Other Drugs.&quot; Almost an entire day of this
3-day conference for policymakers, researchers, and practitioners
centered on the preliminary results from this study. This
conference provided an opportunity to disseminate early study
findings from both the implementation and outcome assessments,
and to incorporate participants' responses (including responses
from D.A.R.E. America as well as D.A.R.E. and other drug
prevention researchers) to the findings in this final report. </p>

<p> Strengths and Limitations of the Study </p>

<p> We believe our approach to this study was fully responsive to
NIJ's solicitation. Among the many strengths of this approach are
the following: </p>

<p> o a multifaceted study methodology that collected information
from the national, regional, State, and school district levels of
D.A.R.E. and reviewed all short- term evaluations of the D.A.R.E.
core curricula conducted to date; </p>

<p> o a rigorous examination and synthesis of the results of
previous evaluations of D.A.R.E.; and </p>

<p> o incorporation into this final report of both formal and
informal feedback from researchers and practitioners attending
the dissemination conference. </p>

<p> However, we recognize that there are limitations to our
study, due primarily to limitations in the resources available to
us. For example, our study budget would not allow us to survey
local D.A.R.E. officers and classroom teachers, or monitor the
delivery of D.A.R.E. in the classroom. Additionally, some
questions raised in NIJ's solicitation, such as issues relating
to the effectiveness of the regional and State D.A.R.E. training
centers, could be answered only in part. A complete answer would
have required a many-layered study that examined training
centers' objectives, how these objectives are put into effect
through training received both by trainers and by D.A.R.E.
officers, and ultimately how the officers perform in the
classroom. This was clearly outside the scope of this study. We
also were limited in assessing certain questions, such as
variability in effectiveness of the D.A.R.E. curriculum by the
sociodemographic characteristics of the respondents because of
the lack of research in this area (see Chapter 8 for further
details). </p>

<p> Given the level of resources available for this study, the
research design required some compromises among the multiple
objectives invoked in NIJ's stated purposes, goals, objectives,
and program strategies. </p>

<p> However, the research team believes that the study represents
an optimal mix of data collection methods and sources.
Discussions with members of the D.A.R.E. America RTC Advisory
Board and other officials associated with the D.A.R.E. training
centers, when combined with information gathered from the survey
of State D.A.R.E. coordinators, provided answers to the questions
relating specifically to the structure and operations of the
D.A.R.E. program. The survey of school district drug prevention
coordinators yielded information about D.A.R.E. and its
relationship to other school-based drug prevention programs. The
site visits provided an illustrative, if unrepresentative,
snapshot of D.A.R.E.'s implementation in two schools. A rigorous
examination of past D.A.R.E. evaluations provided information on
the effects of the program on students. </p>

<p> Overview of the Report </p>

<p> This report is organized into four sections and four
appendices. Section I contains the first two chapters, which
provide an overview and history of school-based drug prevention
programs, with detailed information about the curricula and
teachers of D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> Section II has four chapters that present the methodologies
and results of each of the four components of the implementation
assessment. In these four chapters, we present information about
the national/regional-level operations of D.A.R.E. (Chapter 3),
State-level operations of D.A.R.E. (Chapter 4), and the
implementation of D.A.R.E. and other drug prevention programs at
the local level (Chapters 5 and 6). </p>

<p> Section III (Chapter 7) presents the methodology and results
of the outcome assessment. In Section IV (Chapter 8), we
synthesize and discuss findings from both the implementation and
outcome assessments, and present recommendations. </p>

<p> Appendix A contains sampling information for the school
district drug prevention coordinators survey. </p>

<p> Appendix B contains descriptions of each study utilized in
the meta-analysis conducted for the outcome assessment. Appendix
C presents a bibliography of comparison program evaluations, and
Appendix D contains data collection materials for the
implementation assessment. </p>

<p> CHAPTER 2 </p>

<p> OVERVIEW AND HISTORY OF SCHOOL-BASED DRUG PREVENTION PROGRAMS
AND D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> History of School-Based Drug Prevention Programs School-based
educational programs are the most common approach to drug
prevention aimed at young people. </p>

<p> Prevention efforts are located in educational settings </p>

<p> both because drug use typically begins during adolescence </p>

<p> and because classrooms provide the best opportunity for </p>

<p> reaching a large number of youth simultaneously.=20 </p>

<p> Although rates of drug use among U.S. students generally </p>

<p> have been declining over the past few years (University </p>

<p> of Michigan, 1994), these rates are still higher than </p>

<p> rates of all other Western industrialized nations. =20 </p>

<p> The U.S. Congress reacted to concerns about youth </p>

<p> drug use by enacting the Drug-Free Schools and </p>

<p> Communities Act (DFSCA) of 1986. The DFSCA was designed </p>

<p> to establish programs of drug abuse education and </p>

<p> prevention throughout the Nation. A key part of the </p>

<p> DFSCA is Subtitle B of Title IV, which provides Federal </p>

<p> money to States, schools, and communities to initiate or </p>

<p> expand drug prevention programs. Actions resulting from </p>

<p> Subtitle B of Title IV quickly resulted in the single </p>

<p> largest drug prevention activity offered by the Federal </p>

<p> Government, reaching $498,565,000 in FY 1993.=20 </p>

<p> Research conducted by RTI staff concerning the </p>

<p> implementation of State and local programs of the DFSCA </p>

<p> found that in the 1988-1989 school year all 50 States, </p>

<p> the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto </p>

<p> Rico have actively participated in programs funded by the </p>

<p> DFSCA at the State and local levels. Of all the school </p>

<p> districts in the Nation, 78% reported that they received </p>

<p> DFSCA funding, either directly or through regional or </p>

<p> county education organizations (Thorne, Holley, Wine, </p>

<p> Hayward, &amp; Ringwalt, 1991). </p>

<p> The DFSCA funds appear to have had a positive </p>

<p> effect on the school-based prevention programs of school </p>

<p> districts. To be eligible for DFSCA funding, schools </p>

<p> must implement a comprehensive drug prevention program.=20 </p>

<p> More than half of the districts receiving DFSCA funding </p>

<p> reported that since the advent of such support, they had </p>

<p> been able to expand or increase numerous aspects of their </p>

<p> programs, including=20 </p>

<p> o number of grade levels with </p>

<p> substance abuse curricula, </p>

<p> o school-wide emphasis on substance </p>

<p> abuse prevention,=20 </p>

<p> o number of teachers and staff </p>

<p> involved, and=20 </p>

<p> o number of students involved. =20 </p>

<p> A total of 25% of these districts had increased their </p>

<p> curriculum development activities, and 48% had increased </p>

<p> their degree of involvement with other groups in the </p>

<p> community. The availability of DFSCA funds may be more </p>

<p> limited in the future. </p>

<p> Drug Use Prevention Strategies </p>

<p> A variety of school-based intervention programs </p>

<p> have been developed over the past three decades for </p>

<p> preventing drug use among youth (Botvin, 1990; Flay, </p>

<p> 1985; Hansen, 1992; Moskowitz, Malvin, Schaeffer, &amp; </p>

<p> Schaps, 1983; Tobler, 1986). The types of programs </p>

<p> differ both in terms of what they teach as well as in how </p>

<p> they are taught (Tobler, in press, 1994). Program </p>

<p> content generally reflects assumptions about why young </p>

<p> people use drugs. For example, activities to boost self- </p>

<p> esteem reflect the belief that low self-esteem is a risk </p>

<p> factor for drug use; strategies that teach youth how to </p>

<p> refuse offers of drugs from friends assume that peer </p>

<p> pressure leads to drug use. Similarly, teaching methods </p>

<p> implemented in various strategies reflect beliefs about </p>

<p> the most effective means for teaching young people not to </p>

<p> use drugs. Programs that use didactic methods reflect a </p>

<p> traditional expert model for learning; programs that </p>

<p> emphasize group activities reflect the belief that </p>

<p> participatory activities enhance understanding and </p>

<p> learning more effectively. </p>

<p> Although hundreds of individual school-based </p>

<p> prevention programs have been developed, they generally </p>

<p> fall into three broad categories:=20 </p>

<p> (a) knowledge/information programs, (b) affective </p>

<p> programs, and (c) social influences programs. A fourth </p>

<p> category of prevention programs, alternative programs, </p>

<p> includes those usually offered outside the school </p>

<p> setting. Knowledge/information and affective education </p>

<p> programs have sometimes been grouped together as more </p>

<p> traditional approaches, while social influences programs </p>

<p> represent newer approaches (Bruvold, 1993; Tobler, in </p>

<p> press, 1994). These three types of programs tend to </p>

<p> differ in content, in methods, and in their </p>

<p> effectiveness. Even so, there is overlap among them. </p>

<p> Knowledge/information programs were the earliest </p>

<p> school-based prevention efforts to be developed. These </p>

<p> strategies are based on the assumption that youth begin </p>

<p> using drugs because they are not sufficiently </p>

<p> knowledgeable about adverse consequences. Once youth </p>

<p> have adequate and accurate knowledge about drugs, it is </p>

<p> assumed that they will behave rationally and choose not </p>

<p> to use drugs. It is also assumed that changes in </p>

<p> knowledge about drugs will promote more negative </p>

<p> attitudes toward drug use, which in turn will be a </p>

<p> deterrent to using drugs. Knowledge programs typically </p>

<p> present factual information about the legal, biological, </p>

<p> and psychological effects of drug use. Some of these </p>

<p> programs have adopted scare tactics to present the risks </p>

<p> of drug use to youth in a dramatic fashion. The methods </p>

<p> used by knowledge/information programs typically include </p>

<p> didactic presentations, discussion, and audiovisual </p>

<p> presentations. </p>

<p> Affective programs were developed in the late 1970s </p>

<p> and early 1980s and are based on the assumption that </p>

<p> young people use drugs because of personal and social </p>

<p> deficits. These programs emphasize increasing self- </p>

<p> esteem, enhancing self-awareness, clarifying values, </p>

<p> making responsible decisions, and improving interpersonal </p>

<p> skills. Affective programs often do not mention drug use </p>

<p> at all. By enriching personal and social development, it </p>

<p> is assumed that youth will make responsible decisions </p>

<p> about drug use. These programs typically are taught by </p>

<p> the same types of methods as for knowledge/ information </p>

<p> programs, but they also may include group activities. </p>

<p> Social influences programs are the most recent </p>

<p> approach to drug use among youth. These programs are </p>

<p> based on the assumption that youth use drugs because they </p>

<p> do not have the social competencies needed to resist </p>

<p> social pressures to use drugs. Some programs focus </p>

<p> specifically on teaching youth the skills needed for </p>

<p> resisting drug use influences. Other programs emphasize </p>

<p> developing more general social competencies, such as </p>

<p> increasing decisionmaking, improving communication, and </p>

<p> reducing anxiety, in addition to enhancing drug-specific </p>

<p> social skills. They may also include activities to </p>

<p> correct misperceptions about the prevalence and </p>

<p> acceptability of drug use among peers, as well as </p>

<p> activities that seek to establish conservative group </p>

<p> norms about drug use. Social influences programs </p>

<p> typically include active, participatory learning </p>

<p> experiences, such as modeling, role-playing, and </p>

<p> practicing behavioral skills. Social influence </p>

<p> strategies also frequently and actively involve &quot;peers </p>

<p> leaders&quot; as teachers, in role-playing, or to facilitate </p>

<p> discussion. </p>

<p> Despite the differences across program categories, </p>

<p> there is actually much overlap among school-based </p>

<p> prevention programs in their components. Affective </p>

<p> programs share similarities with some social influences </p>

<p> programs in their emphasis, for example, on developing </p>

<p> personal competencies. Social influences programs </p>

<p> frequently include information about drugs and adverse </p>

<p> consequences. Some programs include elements of all </p>

<p> three categories of programs and have been labeled </p>

<p> comprehensive programs. Indeed, many school-based </p>

<p> curricula, including D.A.R.E., combine strategies that </p>

<p> reflect knowledge/information, affective, and social </p>

<p> influences programs. </p>

<p> Research on the effectiveness of school-based </p>

<p> prevention programs suggests that all three program </p>

<p> strategies are not equally successful in preventing </p>

<p> adolescent drug use (Bangert-Drowns, 1988; Bruvold, 1993; </p>

<p> Tobler, 1986, in press, 1994). Knowledge/information </p>

<p> programs generally have not been effective in preventing </p>

<p> drug use among youth. The evidence suggests that, </p>

<p> although information-based programs may increase </p>

<p> students' knowledge of drugs, they are unlikely to result </p>

<p> in positive changes in either attitudes or behavior. In </p>

<p> fact, some research indicates that these programs may </p>

<p> lead to undesirable changes in attitudes (Bruvold &amp; </p>

<p> Rundall, 1988). Affective strategies also have not </p>

<p> performed well in previous evaluations and meta-analyses </p>

<p> (Botvin, 1990; Tobler, 1986). For example, Hansen, </p>

<p> Johnson, Flay, Graham, and Sobel (1988) found that </p>

<p> students who received an affective education program </p>

<p> reported significantly more drug use than students in a </p>

<p> comparison group and that these differences increased </p>

<p> over time. In contrast, the results of evaluation of </p>

<p> social influences programs have been generally more </p>

<p> positive (Botvin, 1990; Bruvold, 1993, 1986; Bruvold &amp; </p>

<p> Rundall, 1988; Flay, 1985; Hansen, 1992; Moskowitz, 1989; </p>

<p> Pentz et al., 1989; Tobler, 1986, in press, 1994). In </p>

<p> comparison with knowledge/information and affective </p>

<p> programs, social influences programs have been more </p>

<p> effective at preventing adolescent drug use. </p>

<p> History of D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. is a school-based drug prevention program </p>

<p> designed to prevent students' use of tobacco, alcohol, </p>

<p> and other drugs. Most D.A.R.E. activities are directed </p>

<p> toward pupils in the last grade of elementary school </p>

<p> (grade 5 or 6), which is thought to be the age at which </p>

<p> youth are most receptive to an anti-drug message, and </p>

<p> before they begin experimenting with drugs (Bureau of </p>

<p> Justice Assistance [BJA], 1991b). The original D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> core curriculum, which was implemented in 1983, was </p>

<p> developed by Dr. Ruth Rich, health education specialist </p>

<p> from the LAUSD. Dr. Rich based the D.A.R.E. core </p>

<p> curriculum on a review of other prevalent drug prevention </p>

<p> programs, particularly Project SMART (Self-Management and </p>

<p> Resistance Training), a prevention program designed by </p>

<p> the Health Behavior Research Institute of the University </p>

<p> of Southern California. =20 </p>

<p> From its inception, D.A.R.E. was designed to be a </p>

<p> continuing education program for kindergarten through </p>

<p> high school. To that end, junior high and senior high </p>

<p> curricula were developed in 1986 and 1988, respectively.=20 </p>

<p> Additionally, D.A.R.E. designers created a parent </p>

<p> curriculum to teach parents how to recognize and prevent </p>

<p> drug use among youth and to provide them with information </p>

<p> about the program. </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. is distinctive among school-based drug </p>

<p> prevention programs in that it uses trained, uniformed </p>

<p> police officers in the classroom to teach a highly </p>

<p> structured curriculum. D.A.R.E. officers enter the </p>

<p> classroom not only because of a cooperative agreement </p>

<p> between the local school district and law enforcement </p>

<p> agency, but also because the community is willing to </p>

<p> forgo or replace the time that D.A.R.E. officers lose to </p>

<p> other police duties. During D.A.R.E.'s first year, 1983- </p>

<p> 1984, 10 officers taught the curriculum to around 8,000 </p>

<p> students in 50 Los Angeles elementary schools (BJA, </p>

<p> 1991a). D.A.R.E. is now widely implemented throughout </p>

<p> the Nation and parts of Europe and Asia. According to </p>

<p> the BJA (1991b), some 6 million students in the United </p>

<p> States received D.A.R.E. in the 1991-1992 school year, </p>

<p> and D.A.R.E. is currently implemented in 8,000 cities </p>

<p> across the Nation (Glenn Levant, personal communication).=20 </p>

<p> Indeed, the D.A.R.E. workbooks are currently available in </p>

<p> Japanese, Vietnamese, Spanish, and Braille. In addition, </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. has been adopted by several governmental </p>

<p> agencies that sponsor schools, including the Department </p>

<p> of the Interior, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the </p>

<p> Capitol police, the National Park Service, and all </p>

<p> overseas branches of the Department of Defense. </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. combines an essentially local, grass-roots </p>

<p> effort with a high degree of centralized program control </p>

<p> asserted by coordinating mechanisms at the national, </p>

<p> regional, and State levels. At the national level, </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. America assumes the primary responsibility for </p>

<p> implementing and managing D.A.R.E., assisted by five RTCs </p>

<p> that constitute the D.A.R.E. America RTC Advisory Board.=20 </p>

<p> A detailed examination of the roles of national, </p>

<p> regional, and State D.A.R.E. organizations is presented </p>

<p> in Section II, Chapter 3.=20 </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. Curricula </p>

<p> The primary purposes of all the D.A.R.E. curricula </p>

<p> for students are to </p>

<p> o teach students to recognize pressures </p>

<p> to use drugs from peers and from the </p>

<p> media, </p>

<p> o teach students the skills to resist </p>

<p> peer inducements to use drugs, </p>

<p> o enhance students' self-esteem,=20 </p>

<p> o teach positive alternatives to </p>

<p> substance use, and </p>

<p> o increase students' interpersonal, </p>

<p> communication, and decision-making </p>

<p> skills (BJA, 1991a). </p>

<p> Each of the curricula is periodically updated; an updated </p>

<p> version of the core curriculum is currently being pilot </p>

<p> tested and will be implemented in September 1994. A </p>

<p> brief summary of each of the five D.A.R.E. curricula </p>

<p> follows. </p>

<p> The D.A.R.E. core curriculum, which is taught in </p>

<p> the 5th or 6th grade, comprises </p>

<p> 17 hour-long weekly lessons. The D.A.R.E. officers have </p>

<p> sole responsibility for teaching all of the lessons, </p>

<p> although classroom teachers are encouraged to </p>

<p> participate. Officers use a variety of teaching </p>

<p> approaches, including the presentation of facts, group </p>

<p> discussions, role-playing, and workbook exercises. =20 </p>

<p> The core curriculum was updated in 1993 and will be </p>

<p> fully implemented in 1994. The updated curriculum </p>

<p> differs from the previous version in a variety of ways.=20 </p>

<p> The new curriculum, which has been renamed &quot;D.A.R.E. to </p>

<p> Resist Drugs and Violence,&quot; </p>

<p> o includes specific lessons concerning </p>

<p> tobacco and inhalants, </p>

<p> o emphasizes normative beliefs and </p>

<p> protective factors, </p>

<p> o adds violence prevention/conflict </p>

<p> resolution strategies, </p>

<p> o uses more participatory learning </p>

<p> activities, and </p>

<p> o employs a more collaborative </p>

<p> partnership between the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> officer and the teacher in the </p>

<p> classroom (Charles Dunn, personal </p>

<p> communication, June 22, 1993). </p>

<p> In both the old and new versions of the core curriculum, </p>

<p> the lessons are cumulative, building upon concepts </p>

<p> introduced in previous lessons. With the exception of </p>

<p> lesson 14 in both versions, the lessons are implemented </p>

<p> in sequence and without variation. </p>

<p> The data collection for the implementation </p>

<p> assessment and the evaluations studied in the outcome </p>

<p> assessment occurred before the introduction of the new </p>

<p> curriculum. We, therefore, believe it is important to </p>

<p> provide information on both versions. Exhibit 2.1 </p>

<p> presents a summary of the original version of the core </p>

<p> curriculum upon which the outcome evaluation was based, </p>

<p> and Exhibit 2.2 displays a summary of the updated </p>

<p> curriculum.=20 </p>

<p> In elementary schools that receive the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> core curriculum, officers may also visit students in </p>

<p> kindergarten through 4th grade to teach brief </p>

<p> introductory (15- to 20- minute) lessons. Topics in this </p>

<p> curriculum include personal safety, the consequences of </p>

<p> taking medicine and using drugs, saying &quot;no&quot; when
asked </p>

<p> to engage in antisocial activities, and learning about </p>

<p> feelings. </p>

<p> The D.A.R.E. junior high school curriculum was </p>

<p> originally developed to provide or </p>

<p> reinforce information and skills that help students </p>

<p> resist pressure to use drugs. Revisions were made in </p>

<p> 1989 to include violence reduction, conflict resolution, </p>

<p> and anger management. The 10 lessons are taught </p>

<p> cooperatively by the officer and the classroom teacher.=20 </p>

<p> The lessons and activities (summarized in Exhibit 2.3) </p>

<p> are implemented over a 10-day period as part of a </p>

<p> required course, such as health, science, or social </p>

<p> studies. </p>

<p> The senior high school curriculum also focuses on </p>

<p> drug abuse and its effect on communities and young people </p>

<p> (see Exhibit 2.4 for a summary of the lessons). The </p>

<p> senior high school curriculum was designed to be taught </p>

<p> over an 11-day period during health or another </p>

<p> appropriate class. Responsibility for teaching the </p>

<p> lessons is divided between the officer and the classroom </p>

<p> teacher. Officers and teachers are trained together and </p>

<p> are encouraged to be present during the entire 11-day </p>

<p> period. </p>

<p> Because of the difficulties educators have </p>

<p> continually faced persuading parents to attend school </p>

<p> educational functions, the D.A.R.E. parent curriculum was </p>

<p> designed to be </p>

<p> implemented where parents live and work. This curriculum </p>

<p> consists of four or five 2-hour Exhibit 2.1 D.A.R.E.'s

<p> abuse; </p>

<p> provides an </p>

<p> exchange of </p>

<p> ideas on </p>

<p> resources and </p>

<p> referrals </p>

<p> sessions generally held in the evenings (see Exhibit 2.5 </p>

<p> for a summary of these lessons). Topics covered in this </p>

<p> curriculum include developing better skills to interact </p>

<p> with children, learning about peer pressures, and </p>

<p> identifying signs and reducing risks of potential </p>

<p> substance abuse. </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. Officers and Training </p>

<p> Law enforcement agencies exercise considerable </p>

<p> discretion in identifying qualified, motivated police </p>

<p> officers to be trained as D.A.R.E. officers. D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> officers must be full-time, uniformed officers with at </p>

<p> least 2 years of experience. When selecting candidate </p>

<p> officers, local police departments are encouraged to </p>

<p> consider the officer's ability to interact with children, </p>

<p> ability to organize, and ability to handle the </p>

<p> unexpected, as well as whether the officer would provide </p>

<p> an exemplary role model and refrain from sexual, racial, </p>

<p> stereotypical, or inappropriate remarks (BJA, 1991b). =20 </p>

<p> Selected officers undergo an intensive, 2-week </p>

<p> course of at least 80 hours of training. Officers are </p>

<p> trained not only in the core curriculum, but also in </p>

<p> public speaking, teaching skills, and classroom </p>

<p> management. Their performance is directly critiqued by </p>

<p> assigned mentors, who are experienced and specially </p>

<p> trained D.A.R.E. officers. Outside speakers and </p>

<p> consultants are also used to instruct the officers in </p>

<p> areas requiring special expertise (e.g., a psychologist </p>

<p> may present information on the stages of child </p>

<p> development). The core curriculum training course </p>

<p> includes opportunities to practice lessons both with </p>

<p> peers and in an actual classroom setting. =20 </p>

<p> Additional training is provided for officers </p>

<p> teaching the junior and senior high school and parent </p>

<p> curricula. Officers teaching these curricula are </p>

<p> required to be certified as a D.A.R.E. officer and to </p>

<p> have taught the core curriculum at least two semesters.=20 </p>

<p> In-service training is provided to review what officers </p>

<p> have previously learned in light of their actual </p>

<p> classroom experiences and to acquaint them with changes </p>

<p> to the curricula. The time that D.A.R.E. officers commit </p>

<p> to the program varies considerably from one law </p>

<p> enforcement jurisdiction to the next. For some officers, </p>

<p> particularly those in large urban departments, teaching </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. is a full-time occupation. In departments that </p>

<p> serve rural communities, D.A.R.E. officers administer the </p>

<p> program on a part-time basis, devoting the remainder of </p>

<p> their time to other law enforcement tasks. =20 </p>

<p> Once in the field, D.A.R.E. officer performance is </p>

<p> monitored by mentors who observe classroom presentations </p>

<p> and evaluate performance. Mentors may also use input </p>

<p> from school administrators, classroom teachers, health </p>

<p> education coordinators, and advisory committees to </p>

<p> provide officers with feedback on their presentations. =20 </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. in the Context of Other School-Based Drug Use </p>

<p> Prevention Programs </p>

<p> Considering that the D.A.R.E. curricula were based </p>

<p> on several preexisting school-based drug prevention </p>

<p> curricula (primarily Project SMART), it is not surprising </p>

<p> that the curricula closely resemble other programs in </p>

<p> content. Exhibit 2.6 show that D.A.R.E.'s core </p>

<p> curriculum includes lessons that represent all three </p>

<p> curricular strategies discussed earlier.=20 </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. differs from most other school-based drug </p>

<p> prevention programs in the structure by which it is </p>

<p> organized and implemented. First, D.A.R.E. is </p>

<p> implemented by law enforcement officers; most other </p>

<p> programs are taught by teachers. Second, D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> officer training lasts 2 weeks and is highly intensive; </p>

<p> most drug prevention program training for teachers is of </p>

<p> a shorter duration. Third, D.A.R.E. officers are </p>

<p> strongly encouraged to deliver their lessons in sequence, </p>

<p> departing only minimally (if at all) from their lesson </p>

<p> plans; teachers are much more free to adapt curricula at </p>

<p> will, emphasizing those areas they believe to be most </p>

<p> salient or useful or integrating the drug prevention </p>

<p> material into their general education curriculum.=20 </p>

<p> Fourth, D.A.R.E. officer performance is often carefully </p>

<p> monitored and evaluated; generally, the accountability </p>

<p> mechanisms for teachers' implementation of their </p>

<p> curricula are less structured. Fifth, the mission of </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. officers in the school is exclusively drug </p>

<p> prevention; to most teachers, drug prevention is often </p>

<p> only part of a larger curriculum. </p>

<p> CHAPTER 3 </p>

<p> NATIONAL AND REGIONAL OPERATIONS </p>

<p> In any consideration of the organization of </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. at the national and regional levels, it is </p>

<p> important to remember that D.A.R.E. is very much a grass- </p>

<p> roots program. In essence, it is a product of memoranda </p>

<p> of understanding between community law enforcement and </p>

<p> local public school districts across the Nation. The </p>

<p> primary purposes of the D.A.R.E. hierarchy described in </p>

<p> this chapter are to ensure the integrity of the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> curriculum and the fidelity with which it is delivered; </p>

<p> to develop and uphold standards for the integrity, </p>

<p> coordination, and quality of D.A.R.E. operations; and to </p>

<p> provide support to D.A.R.E. at the community level. </p>

<p> As we have said, in its degree of organization at </p>

<p> the national and regional levels, D.A.R.E. differs </p>

<p> greatly from other school-based drug use prevention </p>

<p> programs, most of which limit their activities to </p>

<p> delivering packaged curricula to school districts and </p>

<p> offering some level of training to teachers. In </p>

<p> contrast, the D.A.R.E. organization oversees all aspects </p>

<p> of the prevention program, including the consistency with </p>

<p> which it is implemented in the classroom. In this </p>

<p> chapter, we discuss the functions of D.A.R.E. America, </p>

<p> the preeminent D.A.R.E. organization, and its </p>

<p> relationship with the </p>

<p> o D.A.R.E. America RTC Advisory Board; </p>

<p> o State Training Centers, State Charter </p>

<p> Organizations; and State D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> Coordinators; </p>

<p> o Los Angeles United School District </p>

<p> (LAUSD); and </p>

<p> o D.A.R.E. America Scientific Advisory </p>

<p> Board. </p>

<p> We obtained much of the information for this chapter from </p>

<p> an interview conducted in August 1994 with Glenn Levant, </p>

<p> Executive Director of D.A.R.E. America. This information </p>

<p> is supplemented by relevant D.A.R.E. documents. We also </p>

<p> summarize a series of loosely structured interviews </p>

<p> conducted in 1992 with representatives of the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> America RTC Advisory Board. </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. at the national, regional, State, and </p>

<p> local levels is promoted, monitored, and overseen by </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. America, which is chartered as a nonprofit </p>

<p> organization. As specified in its charter, D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> America has responsibility for a variety of key func- </p>

<p> tions, including </p>

<p> o administering the D.A.R.E. program, </p>

<p> o providing educational materials to </p>

<p> communities implementing D.A.R.E., </p>

<p> o overseeing D.A.R.E. officer training </p>

<p> and ensuring its consistency, </p>

<p> o improving the curriculum, and </p>

<p> o providing support to D.A.R.E. both </p>

<p> nationally and internationally. =20 </p>

<p> In 1988, the BJA awarded four grants to establish </p>

<p> the RTCs that constitute the D.A.R.E. America RTC </p>

<p> Advisory Board, and a fifth RTC was established the </p>

<p> following year. The RTCs are located in Arizona, </p>

<p> California, Illinois, Virginia, and North Carolina, and </p>

<p> the States associated with each are presented in Exhibit </p>

<p> 3.1. The responsibilities of the RTCs include making </p>

<p> recommendations to D.A.R.E. America concerning the </p>

<p> accreditation of State-level training centers. In </p>

<p> addition, the RTCs provide oversight to the local </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. programs to ensure that the copyrighted </p>

<p> curriculum is taught as specified. Educational </p>

<p> specialists representing the five RTCs, together with </p>

<p> staff of the LAUSD, are charged with curricular </p>

<p> development, taking advice from the Scientific Advisory </p>

<p> Board and other specialists. In Federal FY 1994, it is </p>

<p> expected that the BJA grant, which in the past has flowed </p>

<p> to the RTCs, will come directly to D.A.R.E. America to </p>

<p> support the RTCs. </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. is also organized at the State level. In </p>

<p> more than one-third of the States, D.A.R.E. America has </p>

<p> helped charter a nonprofit (501C3) organization, over </p>

<p> which D.A.R.E. America has oversight, and which is </p>

<p> designed to support the program in that State. The board </p>

<p> of the chartered organization typically comprises the </p>

<p> State's attorney general, the superintendent of </p>

<p> education, and prominent business and education people.=20 </p>

<p> The board of directors may also include a representative </p>

<p> of the State's D.A.R.E. Officers' Association (described </p>

<p> below) as well as, in some States, a D.A.R.E. coordinator </p>

<p> whose prominence and position may vary considerably. It </p>

<p> is expected that in time there will be D.A.R.E. charter </p>

<p> organizations in the remaining States. In those States </p>

<p> that currently lack a charter organization, there is </p>

<p> typically some individual identified as the State </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. coordinator who often is a State employee. This </p>

<p> person's responsibilities include coordinating candidate </p>

<p> selection and scheduling training for D.A.R.E. officers, </p>

<p> obtaining State funds to support D.A.R.E. programs, </p>

<p> providing local technical assistance, and overseeing </p>

<p> policy development and implementation at the State level.=20 </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. America meets with these individuals, and with </p>

<p> the State charter organizations, on a quarterly basis. </p>

<p> In addition to D.A.R.E. State charter organizations </p>

<p> at the State level, a total of 42 States currently have </p>

<p> developed State Training Centers (STCs), the purpose of </p>

<p> which is to conduct training for prospective D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> officers. These centers are differentially accredited; </p>

<p> all conduct training for prospective D.A.R.E. officers in </p>

<p> the core curriculum, while only some are accredited to </p>

<p> teach the other curricula or to train D.A.R.E. mentors.=20 </p>

<p> The STCs are supported both by the States and by D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> America. The level of activity of these centers varies </p>

<p> considerably given the size of the State and demand for </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. officer training. At present, there are some </p>

<p> 20,000 certified D.A.R.E. officers. </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. America also owns and protects the </p>

<p> copyright to the D.A.R.E. name, logo, and associated </p>

<p> slogans. D.A.R.E.'s name is considered a valuable </p>

<p> intellectual property. D.A.R.E. America approves all </p>

<p> materials (e.g., bumper stickers) and celebrities used to </p>

<p> promote the D.A.R.E. program. In addition, the </p>

<p> organization screens sponsors for fund-raising events to </p>

<p> exclude companies manufacturing alcohol or tobacco </p>

<p> products. =20 </p>

<p> Together with the LAUSD, D.A.R.E. America owns the </p>

<p> copyright to the core curriculum. The superintendent of </p>

<p> the LAUSD has been represented on the board of D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> America since 1983. Through the RTCs, D.A.R.E. America </p>

<p> monitors the implementation of D.A.R.E. in each community </p>

<p> and may withdraw its permission to use D.A.R.E. if a </p>

<p> local school district has improperly modified the </p>

<p> curriculum. To fulfill its responsibility of improving </p>

<p> the curriculum, D.A.R.E. America established in 1993 a </p>

<p> Scientific Advisory Board, which is chaired by Dr. Herb </p>

<p> Kleber of the Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse </p>

<p> (CASA) at Columbia University. Dr. Kleber was formally </p>

<p> the chief official for demand reduction in the Bush </p>

<p> Administration's White House Office of National Drug </p>

<p> Control Policy (ONDCP). The board includes prevention </p>

<p> specialists from across the Nation. </p>

<p> The National D.A.R.E. Officers' Association, which </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. America helped to found in 1987, serves to </p>

<p> improve communications among police officers within </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. The association now has a State D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> Officers' association in each of the 50 States. Each of </p>

<p> the 18 other countries that have adopted the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> program also has an association of D.A.R.E. officers, </p>

<p> although those association are not formally a part of the </p>

<p> national association. However, all associations, both </p>

<p> domestic and foreign, look to D.A.R.E. America for </p>

<p> guidance in matters of policy. </p>

<p> Finally, D.A.R.E. America provides considerable </p>

<p> support to communities implementing D.A.R.E. in the form </p>

<p> of the educational materials that support the curriculum.=20 </p>

<p> In some cases, D.A.R.E. America offers communities direct </p>

<p> financial support as well. </p>

<p> We collected further information by means of </p>

<p> informal interviews and discussions we conducted with the </p>

<p> coordinators and/or educational advisors of each of the </p>

<p> five RTCs in January 1992. The RTC coordinators/advisors </p>

<p> discussed with us a number of their needs and </p>

<p> recommendations for the D.A.R.E. program. Summaries of </p>

<p> their discussions with us are presented below. </p>

<p> An increasing need for in-service training. RTC </p>

<p> coordinators/advisors indicated that a substantial number </p>

<p> of officers have received D.A.R.E. training in the past </p>

<p> decade. However, they stressed that the original </p>

<p> training of many officers may now be several years old.=20 </p>

<p> RTC coordinators/advisors indicated that although </p>

<p> mechanisms for providing in-service training do exist, </p>

<p> these mechanisms may not be sufficient. Furthermore, </p>

<p> they suggested that because training of new officers </p>

<p> already stretches available resources, the increasing </p>

<p> need for in-service training for existing D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> officers will strain D.A.R.E.'s budget further.=20 </p>

<p> The increasing need to train State D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> coordinators. RTC coordinators/ </p>

<p> advisors indicated that most States now have State </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. coordinators (see Chapter 4). However, they </p>

<p> reported that many are relatively new in these positions </p>

<p> or have received little formal information about how to </p>

<p> conduct their jobs. They stated that coordinator </p>

<p> training should include the responsibilities and roles of </p>

<p> State D.A.R.E. coordinators, as well as how they can </p>

<p> effectively interact both with their RTC and the schools </p>

<p> in their States. RTC coordinators/advisors reported that </p>

<p> plans are currently under way to establish procedures to </p>

<p> accredit State D.A.R.E. coordinators. =20 </p>

<p> The need to improve lines of communication and </p>

<p> clarify lines of authority. RTC coordinators/advisors </p>

<p> indicated that because of the lack of formal training and </p>

<p> the lack of communication among State coordinators, many </p>

<p> State D.A.R.E. coordinators have had to learn their jobs </p>

<p> by trial and error. They stated that although a certain </p>

<p> amount of communication occurs among State D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> coordinators (especially among coordinators in </p>

<p> neighboring States), increasing communication would </p>

<p> greatly enhance efficiency by enabling coordinators to </p>

<p> draw on the experiences of others instead of
&quot;reinventing </p>

<p> the wheel.&quot;=20 </p>

<p> RTC coordinators/advisors also indicated that State </p>

<p> coordinators may need assistance with getting local </p>

<p> programs to recognize developing lines of authority. For </p>

<p> example, they stated that in the past, local programs </p>

<p> worked directly with RTCs; they said that many local </p>

<p> programs will need to be prompted to now work with the </p>

<p> STC instead. </p>

<p> The need for increased D.A.R.E. officer mentoring.=20 </p>

<p> At present, RTC coordinators/ </p>

<p> advisors reported that there is a well-developed system </p>

<p> for monitoring D.A.R.E. officer performance in the </p>

<p> classroom. They reported that D.A.R.E. mentors </p>

<p> periodically monitor and evaluate officer performance by </p>

<p> observing classes taught by the officer. They also </p>

<p> indicated that teachers are given the opportunity to rate </p>

<p> officer performance. They reported that D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> officers are informed of any problem areas, told how to </p>

<p> correct these problems, and later reevaluated to ensure </p>

<p> that the problem has been corrected. However, to be </p>

<p> truly useful, RTC coordinators reported that these </p>

<p> mentors should have the time and resources necessary to </p>

<p> work closely with D.A.R.E. officers to improve their </p>

<p> performance. </p>

<p> The need for increased collaboration between </p>

<p> education and law enforcement. RTC coordinators/advisors </p>

<p> indicated that because D.A.R.E. was created as a close </p>

<p> partnership between the LAUSD and the Los Angeles Police </p>

<p> Department, the program is dependent on a strong and </p>

<p> continuing relationship between education and law </p>

<p> enforcement at every level. </p>

<p> At the State level, RTC coordinators/advisors see </p>

<p> close collaboration between the department of education </p>

<p> and the organization administering D.A.R.E. (typically </p>

<p> related to law enforcement) as essential. They indicated </p>

<p> that the institutional commitment of State Departments of </p>

<p> Education to D.A.R.E. is essential, in part, to help </p>

<p> resolve any community-level problems. Further, they </p>

<p> indicated that as administrators of DFSCA funds, State </p>

<p> Departments of Education have an increasing role to play </p>

<p> in providing guidance concerning the various components </p>

<p> of a school district's comprehensive K-12 curriculum </p>

<p> (including D.A.R.E.) and how these components should be </p>

<p> integrated to ensure a comprehensive approach. RTC </p>

<p> coordinators indicated that ways in which State </p>

<p> Departments of Education could play a role in assisting </p>

<p> with the evaluation of D.A.R.E. officer performance </p>

<p> should be examined. </p>

<p> At the local level, RTC coordinators indicated that </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. is initiated when a school district invites a </p>

<p> police department to teach the program. They reported </p>

<p> that the police department nominates a candidate for </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. officer training, and the candidate must be </p>

<p> acceptable to the school district administration. In the </p>

<p> classroom, they stated, the role of the teacher is </p>

<p> evolving from an observer and monitor of the officer's </p>

<p> performance to an active partner in D.A.R.E. instruction.=20 </p>

<p> The need to maintain limits to the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> &quot;bureaucracy&quot;. RTC coordinators/ </p>

<p> advisors stressed that pressures on D.A.R.E. to expand </p>

<p> its operations are considerable. They indicated that as </p>

<p> an institution, D.A.R.E. remains committed to maintaining </p>

<p> high standards at the community level. They reported </p>

<p> that as the role of the State coordinator continues to </p>

<p> become more important in this regard, the need for the </p>

<p> RTCs to provide technical assistance and to monitor State </p>

<p> activities becomes even more crucial. RTC </p>

<p> coordinators/advisors reported that because existing RTC </p>

<p> resources are already strained by current demands, </p>

<p> further growth at the national level seems inevitable.=20 </p>

<p> They indicated that even if support for such growth </p>

<p> exists, however, there is concern that a bureaucracy will </p>

<p> develop that may weaken the &quot;grass-roots&quot; nature of
the </p>

<p> enterprise. Coordinators/advisors indicated that it will </p>

<p> be a challenge to increase the size and capabilities of </p>

<p> the D.A.R.E. bureaucracy to manage and control this </p>

<p> burgeoning program with the need to keep the bureaucracy </p>

<p> streamlined and responsive to the needs of the </p>

<p> communities that D.A.R.E. serves. </p>

<p> The need to locate permanent funding sources. RTC </p>

<p> coordinators/advisors indicated that D.A.R.E. currently </p>

<p> receives substantial support from DFSCA. However, they </p>

<p> feel that Federal DFSCA funds appear to have reached a </p>

<p> plateau in the past 3 years and are likely to be </p>

<p> subjected to budget cuts in the future. RTC </p>

<p> coordinators/advisors fear that D.A.R.E. could be reduced </p>

<p> or even eliminated as a line item. Regardless, they </p>

<p> reported that Federal funding may have been a mixed </p>

<p> blessing, insofar as Federal support may displace local </p>

<p> efforts to secure the resources necessary to implement </p>

<p> the program.=20 </p>

<p> Summary </p>

<p> In this chapter, we focused on the national- and </p>

<p> regional-level operations of D.A.R.E. We conducted </p>

<p> unstructured interviews with the executive director of </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. America and representatives from each of the </p>

<p> RTCs. We also reviewed available documents. </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. is a grass-roots program that operates </p>

<p> through memoranda of understanding between community law </p>

<p> enforcement agencies and local schools. D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> America, a nonprofit organization, coordinates, promotes, </p>

<p> monitors, and assumes ultimate responsibility for the </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. program at all levels. The D.A.R.E. America RTC </p>

<p> Advisory Board, which is composed of staff from the RTCs, </p>

<p> serves in an advisory capacity to D.A.R.E. America. In </p>

<p> addition to making recommendations to D.A.R.E. America, </p>

<p> RTCs are responsible for oversight of the local D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> programs and coordinating and conducting D.A.R.E. officer </p>

<p> training. Organizations and individuals working to </p>

<p> promote and coordinate the D.A.R.E. program at the State </p>

<p> levelinclude State-chartered nonprofit organizations, State </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. officers' associations, and State D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> coordinators. Also at the State level are STCs that </p>

<p> provide training to D.A.R.E. officers. </p>

<p> Curriculum development and changes are the </p>

<p> responsibility of educational specialists from each of </p>

<p> the RTCs, together with staff from the LAUSD. A </p>

<p> Scientific Advisory Board, composed of leading prevention </p>

<p> specialists, assists in these endeavors. </p>

<p> Our interviews with the RTC coordinators indicated </p>

<p> the following key issues: a need for increased in- </p>

<p> service training and mentoring, providing training to </p>

<p> State D.A.R.E. coordinators, improving communication and </p>

<p> collaboration between agencies, maintaining limits on the </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. bureaucracy, and locating permanent funding </p>

<p> sources. </p>

<p> Findings from this chapter and resulting </p>

<p> recommendations are discussed fully in Chapter 8. </p>

<p> CHAPTER 4 </p>

<p> STATE-LEVEL OPERATIONS </p>

<p> In this chapter, we present the second component of </p>

<p> the implementation assessment, a survey of those </p>

<p> individuals who generally manage the State-level D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> operations: the State D.A.R.E. coordinators. This </p>

<p> component was conducted to fulfill NIJ's request for </p>

<p> information concerning: </p>

<p> o features common to most D.A.R.E. programs, </p>

<p> o funding arrangements for D.A.R.E., </p>

<p> o management of D.A.R.E. and supporting </p>

<p> organizations, and </p>

<p> o availability of the D.A.R.E. curricula. </p>

<p> The primary objective of this component was, of course, </p>

<p> to provide information concerning D.A.R.E.'s State-level </p>

<p> operations. As a secondary objective, we collected </p>

<p> preliminary information to facilitate sample selection </p>

<p> for the school district drug prevention coordinators </p>

<p> survey, the results of which we present in Chapter 5. </p>

<p> This chapter covers both the methodology for and </p>

<p> findings from the survey of State D.A.R.E. coordinators.=20 </p>

<p> The findings section presents data concerning the </p>

<p> administration, funding, implementation, challenges, and </p>

<p> problems of State-level D.A.R.E. operations. </p>

<p> Methodology </p>

<p> Instrument Design </p>

<p> We based the content of the State D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> coordinators' survey on the research issues raised in </p>

<p> NIJ's solicitation, discussions with NIJ personnel, a </p>

<p> review of the literature on D.A.R.E.'s structure and </p>

<p> operations, and an examination of prior studies of </p>

<p> school-based drug education conducted at RTI.=20 </p>

<p> Recognizing that State D.A.R.E. coordinators have </p>

<p> considerable demands on their time, we designed the </p>

<p> instrument to be as brief and straightforward as </p>

<p> possible. To minimize ambiguity and burden, we used </p>

<p> mostly close-ended items. A few open-ended questions </p>

<p> were included to encourage respondents to provide </p>

<p> detailed information. =20 </p>

<p> The survey instrument was composed of two parts: a </p>

<p> questionnaire and a list of school districts. The </p>

<p> questionnaire contained items concerning administration, </p>

<p> funding, and implementation of the State D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> program. The list of school districts contained those </p>

<p> districts we selected from that State for the first-phase </p>

<p> sample of the school district drug prevention </p>

<p> coordinators' survey (see Chapter 5). We asked State </p>

<p> coordinators to indicate whether each district on their </p>

<p> list used D.A.R.E., and we then used this information to </p>

<p> draw the second-phase sample for the school district </p>

<p> survey. </p>

<p> We pretested the instrument on three State D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> coordinators in early February 1992. We also shared the </p>

<p> instrument with all five RTC coordinators and requested </p>

<p> their feedback. We incorporated the responses of pretest </p>

<p> participants, as well the comments of the RTC </p>

<p> coordinators, the NIJ program manager, and other alcohol </p>

<p> and drug prevention program experts into the final draft </p>

<p> of the data collection instrument. A copy of the survey </p>

<p> instrument and other data collection materials can be </p>

<p> found in Appendix D. </p>

<p> Data Collection </p>

<p> In January 1992, the RTC coordinators provided us </p>

<p> with lists of names and addresses of State D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> coordinators. Based on this information, we identified </p>

<p> 44 States with D.A.R.E. coordinators. We mailed each </p>

<p> coordinator a package containing cover letters from the </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. America RTC Advisory Board and RTI, a </p>

<p> questionnaire, and a list of school districts in the </p>

<p> coordinator's State. The cover letter from the RTC </p>

<p> Advisory Board expressed support for the research effort </p>

<p> and encouraged participation. The cover letter from RTI </p>

<p> explained the study, provided assurances that all </p>

<p> information would be kept strictly confidential, and </p>

<p> requested copies of any pertinent State documents </p>

<p> concerning the organization and/or administration of </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. =20 </p>

<p> We mailed the packages to the State D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> coordinators on February 18, 1992. Two weeks after the </p>

<p> initial mailout, we contacted nonresponders by telephone.=20 </p>

<p> We made repeated attempts by mail and telephone to secure </p>

<p> the return of completed materials or to collect the </p>

<p> information by phone. The RTCs were again of great </p>

<p> assistance to us in urging coordinators to return </p>

<p> surveys. </p>

<p> Of the 44 respondents identified by the RTC </p>

<p> coordinators, 39 completed the instrument. For purposes </p>

<p> of verification, one question in the survey asked </p>

<p> respondents to confirm that the State had a D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> coordinator. Although four States responded that they </p>

<p> did not have such a position, we determined after some </p>

<p> investigation that they did have a person who performs a </p>

<p> coordinator's role. Respondents from all four of these </p>

<p> States reported that administration of the State D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> program was one of several roles they performed as </p>

<p> supervisors or directors in law enforcement agencies.=20 </p>

<p> We, therefore, did not delete these responses from our </p>

<p> analysis. It should be noted, however, that because of </p>

<p> skip patterns in the survey instrument, these four </p>

<p> respondents did not complete survey items specifically </p>

<p> directed to the State D.A.R.E. coordinator. =20 </p>

<p> Findings </p>

<p> Administration </p>

<p> To address issues raised in the NIJ solicitation </p>

<p> concerning management of the D.A.R.E. program, we asked a </p>

<p> series of questions about the agencies involved in </p>

<p> D.A.R.E.'s administration at the State level, the </p>

<p> functions of each agency, and the relationships among </p>

<p> them. Findings from these questions are presented below. </p>

<p> Agencies Involved. We first asked respondents to </p>

<p> report the agency with primary responsibility for </p>

<p> managing the State D.A.R.E. program. As shown in Exhibit </p>

<p> 4.1, the great majority of States indicated that a law </p>

<p> enforcement or criminal justice agency was entrusted with </p>

<p> this responsibility. =20 </p>

<p> States are encouraged to establish statewide boards </p>

<p> that will help ensure that the State D.A.R.E. program </p>

<p> accommodates competing points of view, remains responsive </p>

<p> to the needs of its constituency, and continues as a </p>

<p> permanent component of State prevention activities (BJA, </p>

<p> 1988). We asked coordinators if the State had a policy </p>

<p> advisory board (PAB), and 15 States (38%) reported </p>

<p> affirmatively. </p>

<p> To explore PAB membership, we asked the 15 </p>

<p> coordinators with PABs to indicate the </p>

<p> agencies/individuals who held memberships on these boards </p>

<p> and to indicate the representative who chaired it.=20 </p>

<p> Exhibit 4.2 shows that 65% or more of the States with </p>

<p> PABs listed State and local educational agencies, local </p>

<p> law enforcement agencies, and State D.A.R.E. officer </p>

<p> associations among their members. The leadership role of </p>

<p> the PABs was primarily held by law enforcement </p>

<p> representatives. The board was chaired by State law </p>

<p> enforcement agencies in six States, by local law </p>

<p> enforcement in three States, by local education agencies </p>

<p> in two States, by the State Department of Education in </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. is the State Department of Education. States </p>

<p> are encouraged to retain an educational consultant to act </p>

<p> as a liaison between the State Department of Education, </p>

<p> local school administrators, and D.A.R.E. instructors </p>

<p> (BJA, 1988). We, therefore, asked if the State had an </p>

<p> educational consultant. Twenty-five (64%) of the 39 </p>

<p> respondents reported having an educational advisor, and </p>

<p> two States reported two advisors. Further, we inquired </p>

<p> about the employers of these consultants and found that </p>

<p> educational systems employed 17 of the 27 educational </p>

<p> advisors and law enforcement agencies employed 4 (Exhibit </p>

<p> 4.3). </p>

<p> Functions. Next, we sought to examine the </p>

<p> responsibilities of both the State D.A.R.E. coordinators </p>

<p> and the PABs by asking respondents to indicate the </p>

<p> functions of each agency (Exhibit 4.4). The most fre- </p>

<p> quently mentioned roles of State D.A.R.E. coordinators </p>

<p> were D.A.R.E. advocacy and officer training within the </p>

<p> State. The most frequently mentioned roles of PABs were </p>

<p> formulating State policy, exploring funding sources, and </p>

<p> advocating for D.A.R.E.=20 </p>

<p> We also asked respondents to list functions </p>

<p> performed by the State D.A.R.E. coordinators and the PABs </p>

<p> that were not provided as close-ended response options.=20 </p>

<p> Additional duties mentioned for State D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> coordinators included=20 </p>

<p> o acting as liaison to other D.A.R.E. agencies </p>

<p> (three States), </p>

<p> o distributing D.A.R.E. materials (three </p>

<p> States), </p>

<p> o making and managing grant applications (two </p>

<p> o selecting officers (one State), and </p>

<p> o serving as a clearinghouse for information </p>

<p> Communication. As mentioned earlier, State </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. programs are strongly encouraged to develop </p>

<p> relationships with State Departments of Education.=20 </p>

<p> Having an educational consultant, however, does not </p>

<p> guarantee communication between the agencies. We, </p>

<p> therefore, asked the State coordinators about how well </p>

<p> they communicate with the Department of Education. Most </p>

<p> of the State D.A.R.E. coordinators reported having a </p>

<p> great deal (35%) or some (47%) communication with the </p>

<p> State Department of Education. In six States, </p>

<p> coordinators reported little communication, and only one </p>

<p> reported none. Seven coordinators (20%) reported having </p>

<p> a signed agreement between the State D.A.R.E. coordinator </p>

<p> and the Department of Education. =20 </p>

<p> We also asked coordinators about the level of </p>

<p> communication between the PABs and the State Department </p>

<p> of Education. Most of the coordinators reported that </p>

<p> PABs had a great deal of communication with the Depart- </p>

<p> ment of Education. Eight of the 15 States with PABs </p>

<p> reported that their boards had a great deal of </p>

<p> communication, three reported some communication, three </p>

<p> reported little, and one reported none. =20 </p>

<p> Only one State reported that both the State </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. coordinator and the PAB had little communication </p>

<p> with the Department of Education. </p>

<p> Funding </p>

<p> The NIJ solicitation also requested information on </p>

<p> funding arrangements for D.A.R.E. To this end, we asked </p>

<p> respondents to report the amount of funding received by </p>

<p> the primary managing agency. Exhibit 4.5 presents </p>

<p> ranges of funding received for D.A.R.E. at the State </p>

<p> level. Four States reported that no funds were received </p>

<p> for State-level D.A.R.E. operations, and two State </p>

<p> coordinators were unable to provide this information. =20 </p>

<p> The mean amount of funds received by the primary </p>

<p> managing agency for operating D.A.R.E. at the State level </p>

<p> in the 1991-1992 school year (excluding $0 values) was </p>

<p> $273,657; funding ranged from $25,000 to $2,635,000. The </p>

<p> total amount received by the responding States was </p>

<p> $9,260,700. </p>

<p> $300,000 + 17.9 </p>

<p> Data Unavailable 5.1 </p>

<p> We asked the 33 respondents who reported the amount </p>

<p> of funding for State-level operations to identify the </p>

<p> sources of this funding (Exhibit 4.6). Four of the 33 </p>

<p> respondents did not answer this question. We also asked </p>

<p> coordinators to indicate the percentage of funds received </p>

<p> from each source. Fifteen States indicated that all </p>

<p> funds were received from one source (six from the BJA, </p>

<p> four from State governors' grants, two from the State </p>

<p> Department of Education, two from legislative funds, and </p>

<p> one from other sources). Eight States reported that </p>

<p> funding was received from two sources, and eight States </p>

<p> reported receiving funding from three or more sources. =20 </p>

<p> Additionally, we asked respondents to report other </p>

<p> sources of funding not mentioned in the close-ended </p>

<p> response options. Responses included State and local </p>

<p> matching funds, special education trust funds, State </p>

<p> penalty assessment funds, funds from the Exhibit 4.6 Number
of States </p>

<p> *As indicated by Question 2 of the State D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> coordinator survey, this information refers to </p>

<p> funding of State-level D.A.R.E. programs only. D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> America has informed us that all </p>

<p> State-level programs receive support from D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> America (Glenn Levant, personal communi- </p>

<p> cation, August 9, 1994). </p>

<p> Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention </p>

<p> (OJJDP), fund-raisers, and Federal forfeiture funds. </p>

<p> State Training Centers </p>

<p> As mentioned in Chapter 3, one goal of the RTCs has </p>

<p> been to develop STCs in their geographic areas.=20 </p>

<p> Increasingly, RTCs have adopted a &quot;train the
trainer&quot; </p>

<p> model to prepare STCs in their jurisdiction to conduct </p>

<p> their own D.A.R.E. officer training and certification </p>

<p> procedures. We, therefore, asked coordinators whether </p>

<p> their State had its own STC. About 87% (34 States) </p>

<p> reported affirmatively. One of the five States without a </p>

<p> training center reported that the State was in the </p>

<p> process of establishing a training center. </p>

<p> Implementation </p>

<p> To obtain a general idea of the level of </p>

<p> implementation of each of D.A.R.E.'s curricula, we asked </p>

<p> respondents to indicate each curriculum used in the State </p>

<p> during the 1991-1992 school year. All respondents </p>

<p> reported that the core curriculum and the K-4 visitations </p>

<p> were used in at least one school in the State.=20 </p>

<p> Furthermore, 28 States (72%) implemented the junior high </p>

<p> curriculum, 26 States (67%) implemented the senior high </p>

<p> school curriculum, and 9 States (23%) implemented the </p>

<p> parent curriculum in at least one school. </p>

<p> Challenges and Problems </p>

<p> To acquire an understanding of the challenges and </p>

<p> problems facing D.A.R.E. and the State D.A.R.E. coordina- </p>

<p> tor in the coming years, we asked two open-ended </p>

<p> questions about these issues. We categorized the </p>

<p> responses and counted the number of State coordinators </p>

<p> indicating each category. (We advise caution in using </p>

<p> these findings to make recommendations given the small </p>

<p> number of coordinators mentioning each category.) =20 </p>

<p> First, we asked respondents to identify the most </p>

<p> significant issues they face in working with the State's </p>

<p> Department of Education. The two most common responses </p>

<p> were improving communication between agencies (mentioned </p>

<p> by eight States) and acquiring a full-time educational </p>

<p> advisor (mentioned by seven States). Most of the other </p>

<p> responses were specific actions that coordinators wanted </p>

<p> the State Department of Education to undertake, such as </p>

<p> o assisting with program evaluation and monitoring </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. officers (six States), </p>

<p> o formally mandating the D.A.R.E. program (three </p>

<p> States), </p>

<p> o understanding the role of law enforcement in </p>

<p> education (three States), </p>

<p> o assisting with funding for D.A.R.E. (three </p>

<p> States), </p>

<p> o providing greater support for the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> program (two States), </p>

<p> o assisting in training programs (one State), and </p>

<p> o helping resolve problems between officers and </p>

<p> teachers (one State). </p>

<p> We then asked respondents to indicate the most </p>

<p> significant issues facing the State D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> coordinator. It should be noted that most of these </p>

<p> issues could be mentioned by coordinators of other drug </p>

<p> prevention programs, as well as coordinators of D.A.R.E.=20 </p>

<p> Most of the responses centered on funding, communication, </p>

<p> evaluation, and training. The responses, by category, </p>

<p> were as follows:=20 </p>

<p> Funding </p>

<p> o maintaining or increasing funding (13 States) </p>

<p> o locating funding sources (8 States) </p>

<p> o locating funding specifically for training (6 </p>

<p> States) </p>

<p> Communication </p>

<p> o increasing communication between </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. agencies at the local, </p>

<p> regional, and national levels (10 </p>

<p> States) </p>

<p> o improving relations with State </p>

<p> Department of Education (4 States) </p>

<p> o coping with the disorganization of the </p>

<p> program (4 States) </p>

<p> o improving public relations (3 States) </p>

<p> o keeping up with constantly shifting </p>

<p> policies of the D.A.R.E. America RTC </p>

<p> Advisory Board (2 States) </p>

<p> Evaluation </p>

<p> o monitoring officers in the classroom (8 </p>

<p> States) </p>

<p> o evaluating the program (4 States) </p>

<p> Training </p>

<p> o improving training (3 States) </p>

<p> o handling problem officers (2 States) </p>

<p> o obtaining STC certification (1 State) </p>

<p> Staffing </p>

<p> o increasing staffing (6 States) </p>

<p> o formally establishing a State D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> coordinator position (2 States) </p>

<p> o forming a PAB (2 States) </p>

<p> Expansion </p>

<p> o expanding D.A.R.E. to other grades or </p>

<p> schools (7 States). </p>

<p> Summary </p>

<p> This chapter focused on a survey of the </p>

<p> administrators of the State D.A.R.E. programs. Thirty- </p>

<p> nine of the 44 States with State D.A.R.E. coordinators </p>

<p> responded to the survey. =20 </p>

<p> We found that most of the State D.A.R.E. programs </p>

<p> are managed by law enforcement or criminal justice </p>

<p> agencies and that most retain educational consultants.=20 </p>

<p> About two-fifths of the States had PABs. Most of the </p>

<p> coordinators reported high levels of communication </p>

<p> between themselves and the State Department of Education.=20 </p>

<p> They also reported high levels of communication between </p>

<p> the PABs and the Department of Education. Most States </p>

<p> received at least $50,000 in funding for training and </p>

<p> administrative purposes, and most States had their own </p>

<p> STC. </p>

<p> Findings from this chapter and resulting </p>

<p> recommendations are discussed fully in Chapter 8. </p>

<p> CHAPTER 5 </p>

<p> SCHOOL DISTRICT DRUG PREVENTION </p>

<p> COORDINATOR SURVEY </p>

<p> A survey of school district drug prevention </p>

<p> coordinators was the main component of our implementation </p>

<p> assessment. This component of the assessment was </p>

<p> conducted to fulfill NIJ's request for information about </p>

<p> the implementation of D.A.R.E. and other school-based </p>

<p> drug prevention programs at the local level. NIJ </p>

<p> specifically requested information on the following </p>

<p> questions: </p>

<p> o Who usually manages the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> program at the local level? </p>

<p> o How involved in D.A.R.E. are </p>

<p> classroom teachers, churches, and </p>

<p> community groups? </p>

<p> o How extensively are D.A.R.E. and </p>

<p> other school-based alcohol and </p>

<p> other drug (AOD) prevention </p>

<p> programs implemented nationwide </p>

<p> in terms of geography, target </p>

<p> populations (such as ethnic </p>

<p> groups, economic strata, and </p>

<p> urbanicity), and grade levels? </p>

<p> o How do other AOD programs compare </p>

<p> with D.A.R.E. and D.A.R.E. with </p>

<p> them? </p>

<p> o What are local funding </p>

<p> arrangements for D.A.R.E. and </p>

<p> other AOD programs? How do these </p>

<p> resources affect implementation? </p>

<p> A careful reading of these questions reveals that NIJ had </p>

<p> three primary objectives: (a) to secure information </p>

<p> about the administration of D.A.R.E., (b) to develop </p>

<p> estimates of the national prevalence of D.A.R.E. and </p>

<p> other AOD programs, and (c) to make comparisons between </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. and other AOD programs on a variety of issues. =20 </p>

<p> RTI staff developed and conducted a comprehensive </p>

<p> survey of school district drug prevention coordinators </p>

<p> that addressed each of the above-mentioned objectives and </p>

<p> questions. We selected drug prevention coordinators as </p>

<p> respondents, as opposed to classroom teachers or police </p>

<p> officers, because we believed that drug prevention </p>

<p> coordinators were the school district staff members best </p>

<p> able to provide us with a broad perspective on all drug </p>

<p> prevention activities in the district, including both </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. and other AOD prevention programs. </p>

<p> This chapter presents the methodology and findings </p>

<p> for this survey. We should note that for this chapter </p>

<p> the results we display will be descriptive, as opposed to </p>

<p> explanatory, in nature. That is, our purpose is to </p>

<p> report what the school district drug prevention </p>

<p> coordinators have told us, and not attempt to explain why </p>

<p> they responded as they did. Although efforts to explain </p>

<p> our respondents' answer are feasible, we believe they </p>

<p> would ultimately prove unsatisfactory because our </p>

<p> explanatory variables (e.g., the school districts' racial </p>

<p> balance or percentage of youth in poverty) are very </p>

<p> limited, and any differences we find may be misleading. </p>

<p> The findings section first presents information we </p>

<p> received from districts with D.A.R.E., followed by </p>

<p> estimates of the numbers of districts with D.A.R.E. and </p>

<p> other AOD programs, and comparisons of D.A.R.E. with </p>

<p> other AOD programs. At the end of the findings section, </p>

<p> we also provide some general information about drug </p>

<p> policies in all the districts surveyed. </p>

<p> Methodology </p>

<p> Sample Design </p>

<p> The sample design for the school district drug </p>

<p> prevention coordinators' survey was a two-phased </p>

<p> stratified random sample. The two-phases of the sample </p>

<p> design was necessary to meet the multiple goals of this </p>

<p> survey. The goal of the first-phase sample was to </p>

<p> produce estimates by region, district size, socioeconomic </p>

<p> status (SES) categories, ethnicity categories, and </p>

<p> urbanicity. The goal of the second-phase sample was to </p>

<p> enable comparisons between districts with and without </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. A detailed discussion of each phase of the </p>

<p> sample design is discussed below. </p>

<p> Sampling frame. The first step in our sampling </p>

<p> design was to obtain a list of public school districts </p>

<p> nationwide. We obtained such a list from Quality </p>

<p> Educational Data (QED) Inc., of Denver, Colorado. The </p>

<p> QED file, which is updated every summer, lists all public </p>

<p> school districts nationwide and contains a wealth of </p>

<p> useful information for each school district. We used </p>

<p> this file as our sampling frame. Information that we </p>

<p> used from this file included the school district's </p>

<p> o SES (defined as the percentage of </p>

<p> children in the district below </p>

<p> poverty level), </p>

<p> o urbanicity (defined as urban, </p>

<p> suburban, or rural), </p>

<p> o ethnicity (defined as the </p>

<p> percentage of children in the </p>

<p> district who were black or </p>

<p> Hispanic), and </p>

<p> o district size (defined as the </p>

<p> number of students enrolled in </p>

<p> the district). =20 </p>

<p> For each of the 14,715 districts on the QED file, </p>

<p> we created five new variables that we later used for </p>

<p> stratification and weighting purposes. First, we created </p>

<p> a region variable that was based on the jurisdictions of </p>

<p> D.A.R.E.'s five RTCs (see Chapter 3, Exhibit 3.1). Next, </p>

<p> to keep the total number of stratum cells within </p>

<p> reasonable bounds, we dichotomized urbanicity, SES, </p>

<p> ethnicity, and district size. We first collapsed the </p>

<p> urban and suburban categories on the QED file into one </p>

<p> category. We computed percentiles for minority status, </p>

<p> SES, and district size within each region-by-urbanicity </p>

<p> group. We then used the median of each variable to </p>

<p> define two categories (low/high) for each of the three </p>

<p> variables. The number and percentage of school districts </p>

<p> in the sampling frame in each of the strata are presented </p>

<p> in Appendix A, Exhibit A.1. </p>

<p> First-Phase Sampling. The goal of the first-phase </p>

<p> of our sampling design was to ensure that we selected a </p>

<p> nationally representative sample of school districts.=20 </p>

<p> Additionally, we wanted to ensure that districts in each </p>

<p> region, urbanicity category, SES category, minority </p>

<p> status category, and district size category were </p>

<p> adequately sampled. Therefore, our first-phase sample </p>

<p> was a stratified random sample. =20 </p>

<p> The first step in selecting our first-phase sample </p>

<p> was to define each strata. We initially constructed 10 </p>

<p> region-by-urbanicity strata by crossing the 5 regional </p>

<p> strata with the 2 urbanicity strata. We then crossed </p>

<p> each of these 10 strata with 2 SES categories (resulting </p>

<p> in 20 strata). We then crossed each of those 20 strata </p>

<p> by minority status (resulting in 40 strata). Finally, we </p>

<p> crossed each of those 40 strata by district size </p>

<p> (resulting in 80 strata). The number of school districts </p>

<p> in the sampling frame in each of the 80 strata is </p>

<p> presented in Appendix A, Exhibit A.2. </p>

<p> The next step in our sampling design was to </p>

<p> determine how districts from each strata would be </p>

<p> selected for inclusion in the first-phase sample. We </p>

<p> assayed two methods of allocating the sample to strata.=20 </p>

<p> In the first method, we assigned equal sample sizes </p>

<p> across strata (i.e., we sampled 15 districts from every </p>

<p> stratum regardless of whether the stratum in the sampling </p>

<p> frame contained 15 or 200 districts). This method would </p>

<p> have ensured good precision across strata. In the second </p>

<p> method, we assigned sample sizes proportional to the </p>

<p> frame size within each stratum. For example, if 5% of </p>

<p> the districts in the sampling frame were in a particular </p>

<p> stratum, proportional sampling would have ensured that 5% </p>

<p> of the first-phase sample would be allocated to that same </p>

<p> stratum. Unlike equal allocation, proportional </p>

<p> allocation yields approximately equal sampling weights, </p>

<p> reduces variance, and thus provides better precision for </p>

<p> overall survey estimates. =20 </p>

<p> Because of its clear advantages, we chose </p>

<p> proportional sampling. Thus, we randomly selected a </p>

<p> proportional number of school districts within each of </p>

<p> the 80 strata. The first-phase sample consisted of 1,500 </p>

<p> school districts. Exhibits displaying the sample </p>

<p> allocation to strata are provided in Appendix A, Exhibits </p>

<p> A.3 and A.4. </p>

<p> Second-Phase Sampling. The goal of the second- </p>

<p> phase of our sampling design was to ensure that the </p>

<p> second-phase sample included both D.A.R.E. and non- </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. school districts. To make this determination, </p>

<p> we asked State D.A.R.E. or DFSCA coordinators to classify </p>

<p> the 1,500 school districts in the first-phase sample as </p>

<p> either D.A.R.E. or non-D.A.R.E. districts (see Chapter </p>

<p> 4). Because some State coordinators did not return this </p>

<p> information or only partially completed the information, </p>

<p> we created a third category of school districts with an </p>

<p> unknown D.A.R.E. status. State coordinators reported </p>

<p> that 43% of the sampled districts used D.A.R.E. and 40% </p>

<p> did not; D.A.R.E. status was unknown for 17% of the </p>

<p> districts. Exhibit A.5 in Appendix A displays the </p>

<p> responses of the State coordinators on the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> status of the first-phase sample by region. </p>

<p> The next step in selecting our second-phase sample </p>

<p> was to determine the number of districts to be selected.=20 </p>

<p> Calculations to determine the number of districts needed </p>

<p> in the second-phase sample were based first on the type </p>

<p> of analysis we planned to conduct and second on an </p>

<p> anticipated 80% response rate. Because we calculated </p>

<p> that 400 responding school districts were necessary to </p>

<p> achieve sufficient statistical power and precision, we </p>

<p> selected a second-phase sample of 500 school districts. </p>

<p> Finally, we used the classifications provided by </p>

<p> the State coordinators to select proportional numbers of </p>

<p> school districts with D.A.R.E., without D.A.R.E., and </p>

<p> with unknown D.A.R.E. status across the five regions.=20 </p>

<p> Thus, we selected 215 school districts with D.A.R.E., 200 </p>

<p> without D.A.R.E., and 85 with unknown D.A.R.E. status.=20 </p>

<p> Exhibit A.6 in Appendix A displays the second-phase </p>

<p> sample by region and D.A.R.E. status. </p>

<p> Survey Estimation. All survey estimates were </p>

<p> computed using software developed at RTI specifically for </p>

<p> the analysis of surveys based on complex sample designs.=20 </p>

<p> We computed analysis weights that took into account the </p>

<p> two-phase stratified sample design. Weighted data </p>

<p> provides a less biased estimate than unweighted data </p>

<p> because the weighted data more accurately represents the </p>

<p> true population. The weights varied across strata based </p>

<p> on region, ethnic composition, urbanicity, SES, and size </p>

<p> of the school district. Analysis weights were computed </p>

<p> as the product of the first-phase sample weight and the </p>

<p> second-phase sample weight. Sampling weights were also </p>

<p> adjusted for nonresponse. We performed quality checks on </p>

<p> the analysis weights to ensure that the sum of the </p>

<p> analysis weights coincides with the number of districts </p>

<p> in the frame. We also examined the variability of the </p>

<p> analyses weights and their impact on survey variances. </p>

<p> Instrument Design </p>

<p> RTI staff determined the contents of the school </p>

<p> district drug prevention coordinators' survey based on </p>

<p> the research issues raised in NIJ's solicitation, </p>

<p> discussions with NIJ personnel, a review of the </p>

<p> literature, and examination of the studies of drug </p>

<p> education programming previously conducted at RTI. We </p>

<p> used close-ended items whenever possible to minimize </p>

<p> ambiguity and burden. A few open-ended questions were </p>

<p> included to encourage respondents to provide detailed </p>

<p> information. =20 </p>

<p> All drug prevention coordinators completed a set of </p>

<p> core items that were designed to provide background </p>

<p> information about the district and about the specific </p>

<p> drug prevention curricula used. Additionally, </p>

<p> coordinators in districts using D.A.R.E., alone or in </p>

<p> combination with other drug prevention curricula, </p>

<p> completed a set of items concerning the D.A.R.E. program </p>

<p> only. Coordinators in districts using other AOD </p>

<p> prevention programs, alone or in combination with </p>

<p> D.A.R.E., completed a set of items concerning other AOD </p>

<p> (i.e., non-D.A.R.E.) programs only. Therefore, school </p>

<p> districts </p>

<p> implementing D.A.R.E. and other AOD programs answered </p>

<p> both sets of items. </p>

<p> After submitting the data collection instrument to </p>

<p> our NIJ program manager for comment and discussion, we </p>

<p> formally pretested all data collection materials and </p>

<p> procedures. Both regional and State DFSCA coordinators </p>

<p> assisted in identifying pretest subjects. Seven school </p>

<p> district drug prevention coordinators (two in New York, </p>

<p> two in South Dakota, one in North Carolina, one in Rhode </p>

<p> Island, and one in South Carolina) completed a pretest </p>

<p> questionnaire in early April 1992. </p>

<p> We used the responses of pretest participants, as </p>

<p> well as the comments of our NIJ program manager and other </p>

<p> AOD prevention program experts, to make final decisions </p>

<p> on the data collection procedures and instruments. A </p>

<p> copy of the survey instrument and other data collection </p>

<p> materials for this component of the study can be found in </p>

<p> Appendix D. </p>

<p> Data Collection </p>

<p> On May 1, 1992, we mailed a cover letter, </p>

<p> questionnaire, and prepaid return envelope to school </p>

<p> district drug prevention coordinators in each of the 500 </p>

<p> selected school districts. The cover letter included a </p>

<p> brief statement of study objectives, information on how </p>

<p> the data would be used, and confidentiality assurances.=20 </p>

<p> Approximately 2 weeks after the initial mailing, we sent </p>

<p> postcards to coordinators who had not responded. The </p>

<p> postcard asked if the initial packet had been received, </p>

<p> reminded the coordinator of the importance of the study, </p>

<p> and offered the RTI toll-free number in case assistance </p>

<p> was needed. Upon request, we provided duplicate </p>

<p> mailouts. </p>

<p> Four packages were returned as undeliverable. Each </p>

<p> of these was followed up by telephone inquiry to </p>

<p> ascertain the correct address. We obtained correct </p>

<p> addresses for three of the four returned packages and </p>

<p> remailed the material. The remaining school district had </p>

<p> recently merged with another school district. Because </p>

<p> this merged district was already included in the sample, </p>

<p> the duplicate was dropped. </p>

<p> We began making follow-up telephone calls to </p>

<p> nonresponders approximately 2 weeks after the reminder </p>

<p> postcards were mailed. Follow-up phone calls were made </p>

<p> by trained RTI telephone interviewers between June 2 and </p>

<p> July 15, 1992. Interviewers encouraged coordinators to </p>

<p> complete and return their instruments as soon as </p>

<p> possible. Those coordinators who indicated to </p>

<p> interviewers that they would not otherwise complete the </p>

<p> instrument were asked to complete the survey over the </p>

<p> telephone. The survey instrument was exactly the same </p>

<p> for both telephone and mail administration. The final </p>

<p> response rate was 85.6%, which considerably surpassed our </p>

<p> expected response rate of 80%. The final sample </p>

<p> disposition is presented in Exhibit 5.1. </p>

<p> Exhibit 5.1 Final Sample Disposition </p>

<p> N % </p>

<p> Completed by phone 289 57.8 </p>

<p> Completed by mail 139 27.8 </p>

<p> Refused 8 1.6 </p>

<p> No response 63 12.6 </p>

<p> Duplicate 1 0.2 </p>

<p> As indicated, we completed almost twice as many </p>

<p> interviews by phone as by mail. We attribute this to </p>

<p> several factors. First, phone surveys traditionally have </p>

<p> higher response rates than mail surveys. Second, the </p>

<p> questionnaires were not mailed until late in the school </p>

<p> year; therefore, coordinators may have had end-of-the- </p>

<p> year obligations that limited the amount of time they </p>

<p> could spend on additional duties. Third, the part of the </p>

<p> instrument that asked about each of the packaged drug </p>

<p> prevention curricula was imposing; we believe that having </p>

<p> the interviewers read these questions to the respondents </p>

<p> may have made answering them less burdensome. Because </p>

<p> the information gathered in this survey was not sensitive </p>

<p> in nature, we believe that data obtained via both methods </p>

<p> of administration are comparable. </p>

<p> Returned questionnaires were delivered to a </p>

<p> check-in station where they were logged in, coded, </p>

<p> manually edited, keyed, and key verified. We implemented </p>

<p> machine-editing procedures to verify and correct skip </p>

<p> patterns and logical inconsistencies. We recontacted a </p>

<p> few school district drug prevention coordinators to </p>

<p> resolve problematic responses, such as incomplete or </p>

<p> contradictory information. </p>

<p> Findings </p>

<p> Administration of D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> The first objective of this survey was to obtain </p>

<p> information about the administration of D.A.R.E. at the </p>

<p> local level. This section presents findings concerning </p>

<p> the implementation, administration, participation of </p>

<p> teachers and the community in the D.A.R.E. program, </p>

<p> integration and coordination of D.A.R.E. with other </p>

<p> school-based drug prevention efforts, problems with </p>

<p> D.A.R.E., and future plans for the use of D.A.R.E. Data </p>

<p> from survey items asked only of the districts with </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. are presented in this section. =20 </p>

<p> Implementation. In the 1991-1992 school year, </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. was implemented in 51.8%, or 222, of the school </p>

<p> districts surveyed. Some 42% of all school districts </p>

<p> surveyed used the core curriculum, 17% used K-4 lessons, </p>

<p> 11% implemented the junior high school curriculum, 3% </p>

<p> used the senior high school curriculum, and 3% used the </p>

<p> parent curriculum. =20 </p>

<p> Of the 222 school districts with D.A.R.E., the </p>

<p> great majority (81%) implemented the core curriculum, </p>

<p> around 33% used the K-4 visitations, 22% used the junior </p>

<p> high school curriculum, 6% implemented the senior high </p>

<p> school curriculum, and 5% used the parent curriculum. We </p>

<p> further asked the respondents to indicate every grade in </p>

<p> which the D.A.R.E. curricula were used. Exhibit 5.2 </p>

<p> displays the percentage of school districts with D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> implementing the program at each grade. Almost 70% of </p>

<p> the districts with D.A.R.E. implemented the curriculum in </p>

<p> 5th-grade classes, and almost 60% used it in 6th-grade </p>

<p> classes. Thus, a substantial number of districts </p>

<p> implemented the core curriculum in both grades, which </p>

<p> probably reflects the different cutoff grades separating </p>

<p> elementary from junior high or middle schools in that </p>

<p> district. </p>

<p> Administration. One objective of NIJ's </p>

<p> solicitation was to ascertain what agencies usually </p>

<p> manage D.A.R.E. and have responsibility for various </p>

<p> aspects of the program at the local level. To address </p>

<p> these issues, we first asked coordinators to report all </p>

<p> agencies managing D.A.R.E. Around 81% of the districts </p>

<p> with D.A.R.E. reported that a single agency administered </p>

<p> the D.A.R.E. program, while 16.3% reported that two </p>

<p> agencies and 2.3% reported that three or more agencies </p>

<p> administered the program (Exhibit 5.3). Almost 34% of </p>

<p> the school districts with D.A.R.E. reported that the </p>

<p> county sheriff's department alone administered the </p>

<p> program, and about 34% reported city/town police </p>

<p> departments administered it.=20 </p>

<p> We next asked coordinators to report whether law </p>

<p> enforcement or education was responsible for various </p>

<p> activities. Coordinators with D.A.R.E. most frequently </p>

<p> reported that law enforcement agencies were responsible </p>

<p> for selecting D.A.R.E. officers and determining classroom </p>

<p> activities (Exhibit 5.4). They reported that </p>

<p> responsibility for selecting schools to receive D.A.R.E., </p>

<p> selecting classrooms to receive D.A.R.E., and assigning </p>

<p> extracurricular D.A.R.E. activities were performed by </p>

<p> education. </p>

<p> Participation of Teachers and Community. NIJ's </p>

<p> solicitation also requested an examination of the extent </p>

<p> of involvement of classroom teachers. About 84% of the </p>

<p> coordinators reported that classroom teachers were </p>

<p> actively involved in the program. We also asked </p>

<p> coordinators about classroom teachers' level of </p>

<p> participation during D.A.R.E. lessons. About 21% </p>

<p> reported a great deal of participation, 46% reported some </p>

<p> participation, 28% reported little participation, and 5% </p>

<p> reported no participation by the classroom teachers. =20 </p>

<p> To determine the extent to which teachers reinforce </p>

<p> the D.A.R.E. lessons, we asked coordinators about </p>

<p> D.A.R.E.-related activities performed by classroom </p>

<p> teachers. Most of the school district drug prevention </p>

<p> coordinators (89%) reported that teachers remain in the </p>

<p> classroom during D.A.R.E. lessons. About 72% reported </p>

<p> that classroom teachers integrate the D.A.R.E. message </p>

<p> into other activities, 39% said that teachers collect </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. homework, and 15% reported that teachers assign </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. homework. </p>

<p> The NIJ solicitation also requested that we examine </p>

<p> the extent to which members of community groups (e.g., </p>

<p> church or youth groups) participate in the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> program. Indeed, recent research suggests that linking </p>

<p> school-based interventions with the larger community </p>

<p> strengthens their effectiveness (Pentz et al., 1989; </p>

<p> Perry &amp; Tobler, 1992). Therefore, we asked the </p>

<p> prevention coordinators to specify members of the </p>

<p> community who were actively involved in D.A.R.E. About </p>

<p> 51% of the coordinators said that parents were actively </p>

<p> involved, 22% indicated that civic groups were so </p>

<p> involved, 13% said that youth groups were so involved, </p>

<p> and 5% said that church groups were so involved. </p>

<p> Integration and Coordination. Another objective </p>

<p> of this study was to examine the extent of D.A.R.E.'s </p>

<p> integration and coordination with other school-based drug </p>

<p> prevention efforts. To address this issue, we first </p>

<p> asked coordinators to indicate the level at which </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. was integrated with other AOD programs. About </p>

<p> 63% of the prevention coordinators reported D.A.R.E. was </p>

<p> very well integrated, 31% reported it was well </p>

<p> integrated, and 7% reported it was poorly integrated. To </p>

<p> determine whether D.A.R.E. was better integrated in some </p>

<p> types of school districts than in others, we examined the </p>

<p> differences in the percentages of coordinators reporting </p>

<p> that D.A.R.E. was very well integrated by minority </p>

<p> status, SES, urbanicity, and district size. No </p>

<p> statistically significant differences were found.=20 </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. was equally well integrated with other AOD </p>

<p> programs across different types of school districts. </p>

<p> One type of mechanism for coordinating the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> responsibilities of law enforcement with those of </p>

<p> education agencies are written agreements that solidify </p>

<p> commitment, define roles and duties, and establish sound </p>

<p> working relationships. We asked coordinators about the </p>

<p> existence of such agreements and found that approximately </p>

<p> 44% of the coordinators reported that their district had </p>

<p> a written agreement. We asked those coordinators with </p>

<p> written agreements about the contents of these </p>

<p> agreements. The following components of the agreements </p>

<p> were mentioned by the accompanying number of </p>

<p> coordinators: </p>

<p> o the responsibilities of all parties (23 </p>

<p> coordinators); </p>

<p> o time (21 coordinators); </p>

<p> o funding/fees (20 coordinators); </p>

<p> o scheduling (15 coordinators); </p>

<p> o curricula (10 coordinators); </p>

<p> o schools to be offered in (9 coordinators); </p>

<p> o grades used in (6 coordinators); </p>

<p> o general use of D.A.R.E. (6 coordinators); </p>

<p> o length of program (5 coordinators); </p>

<p> o school policies (4 coordinators); </p>

<p> o sequence of lessons (3 coordinators); </p>

<p> o materials (3 coordinators);=20 </p>

<p> o graduation program (3 coordinators); and </p>

<p> o &quot;don't know&quot; (4 coordinators). </p>

<p> Problems. We asked school district drug prevention </p>

<p> coordinators to provide information concerning problems </p>

<p> with implementing and coordinating D.A.R.E., and to </p>

<p> suggest how the effectiveness of D.A.R.E. might be </p>

<p> improved.=20 </p>

<p> We asked coordinators to indicate whether there </p>

<p> were any barriers to implementing D.A.R.E. and then to </p>

<p> specify these barriers. Only 26% of the school district </p>

<p> drug prevention coordinators with D.A.R.E. mentioned any </p>

<p> barrier to implementing the program. Some 16% of the </p>

<p> coordinators with D.A.R.E. mentioned inadequate funding </p>

<p> as a barrier to implementation, 13% mentioned too few </p>

<p> officers, and 11% mentioned scheduling difficulties </p>

<p> (Figure 5.5). The two most frequently mentioned barriers </p>

<p> were in areas over which the school system has little </p>

<p> control (funding and number of officers). </p>

<p> Exhibit 5.5 Problem Areas That Are Barriers to </p>

<p> Implementing D.A.R.E. in All Schools </p>

<p> Note: Based on responses of coordinators using D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> (N=3D222). </p>

<p> Next, in an open-ended question, we asked </p>

<p> coordinators to elaborate on any problems with the </p>

<p> coordination of D.A.R.E. The responses of those with </p>

<p> problems were </p>

<p> o lack of time (19 coordinators); </p>

<p> o insufficient funding/staff (12 coordinators); </p>

<p> o scheduling problems (9 coordinators); </p>

<p> o officers not good teachers (5 coordinators); </p>

<p> o difficulties getting program started (4 </p>

<p> coordinators); </p>

<p> o inadequate officer/teacher interaction (4 </p>

<p> coordinators); </p>

<p> o officer scheduling problems/absences (4 </p>

<p> coordinators); </p>

<p> o other officer problems (4 coordinators); and </p>

<p> o lack of coordination between school and </p>

<p> police (3 coordinators). </p>

<p> Finally, we asked coordinators what, if any, </p>

<p> changes they thought would make D.A.R.E. more effective </p>

<p> in their district, and then to elaborate on these </p>

<p> changes. About one-third of the coordinators mentioned </p>

<p> that there was at least one change that they thought </p>

<p> would make D.A.R.E. more effective. The following </p>

<p> responses were the changes they mentioned: </p>

<p> o expand to other grade levels (26 </p>

<p> coordinators); </p>

<p> o increase staff/officers (11 coordinators); </p>

<p> o increase parental participation (7 </p>

<p> coordinators); </p>

<p> o increase funding (6 coordinators); </p>

<p> o increase community involvement (6 </p>

<p> coordinators); </p>

<p> o increase teacher training and involvement (5 </p>

<p> coordinators); </p>

<p> o improve quality/dependability officers (4 </p>

<p> coordinators); </p>

<p> o increase integration with other curricula (4 </p>

<p> coordinators); </p>

<p> o increase time spent on D.A.R.E. (3 </p>

<p> coordinators); </p>

<p> o decrease time spent on D.A.R.E. (3 </p>

<p> coordinators); =20 </p>

<p> o increase publicity (2 coordinators); </p>

<p> o adapt curriculum to grade level (2 </p>

<p> coordinators); </p>

<p> o change curricula (2 coordinators); </p>

<p> o teach officers to be teachers (2 </p>

<p> coordinators); </p>

<p> o increase refresher training for officers (2 </p>

<p> coordinators); </p>

<p> o include D.A.R.E. as part of student </p>

<p> assistance program (1 coordinator); </p>

<p> o increase D.A.R.E.'s availability in </p>

<p> rural/isolated areas (1 coordinator). </p>

<p> Future Use of D.A.R.E. To examine whether the </p>

<p> demand for D.A.R.E. is </p>

<p> going to increase or diminish over the next few years, we </p>

<p> asked coordinators about their future plans for D.A.R.E.=20 </p>

<p> Some 43% of the coordinators with D.A.R.E. planned to </p>

<p> expand use of D.A.R.E. in the next 5 years, and 55% </p>

<p> planned to maintain the current level (only 2% planned to </p>

<p> decrease use). Of the 208 school districts without </p>

<p> D.A.R.E., 38% had not considered using D.A.R.E., 21% </p>

<p> planned to implement D.A.R.E. in the future, 20% were </p>

<p> undecided, 15% reported they definitely will not use </p>

<p> D.A.R.E., and 6% had discontinued use of D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> Further, to determine whether any particular type </p>

<p> of school district was more likely to expand use of </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. in the next 5 years, we examined the differences </p>

<p> in the percentages of districts planning to increase </p>

<p> their use of D.A.R.E. by minority status, SES, or </p>

<p> urbanicity. No statistically significant differences </p>

<p> were found. Plans for the expansion of D.A.R.E. were </p>

<p> fairly equal across different types of school districts.=20 </p>

<p> National Prevalence Estimates of D.A.R.E. and Other AOD </p>

<p> Programs </p>

<p> The second objective of this survey was to develop </p>

<p> national estimates of the prevalence of D.A.R.E. and </p>

<p> other AOD programs. To accomplish this objective, we </p>

<p> asked coordinators to indicate all published drug </p>

<p> prevention curricula used by the school district in the </p>

<p> 1991-1992 school year. Based on previous research and </p>

<p> discussions with school-based drug prevention curricula </p>

<p> experts, we provided a list of 13 published curricula </p>

<p> that we thought coordinators would mention most often.=20 </p>

<p> In addition, we provided ample space for open-ended </p>

<p> responses concerning other published curricula. We </p>

<p> used this information in combination with the sample </p>

<p> stratification variables to develop estimates by </p>

<p> geographical area, ethnicity, SES, and urbanicity. We </p>

<p> also asked respondents to complete a series of questions </p>

<p> concerning grade levels and substances targeted, as well </p>

<p> as type of teachers for each of these curricula.=20 </p>

<p> Based on the number of school districts in our </p>

<p> sample using the three most frequently mentioned </p>

<p> curricula, we estimated the number of school districts </p>

<p> nationwide using these curricula. These prevalence </p>

<p> estimates and other findings concerning the three most </p>

<p> frequently mentioned published drug prevention curricula </p>

<p> used in the 1991-1992 school year are presented below. </p>

<p> Prevalence. According to our estimates, the </p>

<p> published curricula used most often by our respondents in </p>

<p> the 1991-1992 school year were D.A.R.E., Quest, and </p>

<p> Here's Looking at You. Exhibit 5.6 presents the </p>

<p> estimated numbers and percentages of school districts </p>

<p> nationwide using these three curricula overall and by the </p>

<p> districts' region, urbanicity, SES, minority status, and </p>

<p> significantly more likely than small school districts to </p>

<p> use D.A.R.E. (p&lt;.01). =20 </p>

<p> Grade Levels Targeted. To determine grade levels </p>

<p> targeted by each of the three most frequently used </p>

<p> curricula, we asked coordinators to indicate which </p>

<p> curricula were used in the school district at each grade </p>

<p> level. Grade levels targeted by coordinators with </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. were presented in Exhibit 5.2. Around 46% of </p>

<p> the school districts with Quest targeted the program to </p>

<p> the elementary school level, 81% to the middle/junior </p>

<p> high school level, and 12% to the senior high school </p>

<p> level. Almost 89% of the school districts with HLY </p>

<p> targeted the program to the elementary school level, 55% </p>

<p> to the middle/junior high school level, and 35% to the </p>

<p> senior high school level. Coordinators reported that all </p>

<p> three curricula were more likely to target elementary or </p>

<p> middle/junior high school levels. </p>

<p> Substances Targeted. To determine whether the </p>

<p> three most frequently mentioned curricula differed in </p>

<p> substances targeted by the program, we asked the school </p>

<p> district drug prevention coordinators to indicate which </p>

<p> substances each of the prevention curricula targeted. We </p>

<p> found no significant differences in substances targeted </p>

<p> among D.A.R.E., Quest, and HLY (Exhibit 5.7). All three </p>

<p> of the packages were comprehensive in targeting all </p>

<p> substances.=20 </p>

<p> indicate who taught each of the prevention curricula. As </p>

<p> expected, almost all school district drug prevention </p>

<p> coordinators reported that police officers were </p>

<p> responsible for teaching the D.A.R.E. curricula.=20 </p>

<p> Classroom teachers were primarily responsible for </p>

<p> teaching Quest and HLY (Exhibit 5.7). More than one- </p>

<p> fifth of the coordinators reported that classroom </p>

<p> teachers were also involved in teaching D.A.R.E. =20 </p>

<p> Comparison of D.A.R.E. and Other AOD Programs </p>

<p> The final objective of this study was to make </p>

<p> comparisons between D.A.R.E. and other AOD programs on a </p>

<p> variety of issues. Comparison data are presented in this </p>

<p> section. Topics include funding, satisfaction with the </p>

<p> curricula, support for the curricula, and adaptations to </p>

<p> curricula. We asked respondents to report on other AOD </p>

<p> curricula in general because it would have been too </p>

<p> burdensome and time-consuming for them to answer each of </p>

<p> the questions for every curricula in use during the 1991- </p>

<p> 1992 school year. =20 </p>

<p> We first asked school district drug prevention </p>

<p> coordinators with D.A.R.E. (222 of the 429 respondents) </p>

<p> to answer a set of survey items concerning their D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> programs only. We asked all coordinators using other </p>

<p> (non-D.A.R.E.) AOD programs (406 of the 429 respondents) </p>

<p> to answer an identical set of items concerning their </p>

<p> other AOD curricula only. The respondents using both </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. and other AOD programs answered both sets of </p>

<p> items. Information gathered from these matched sets of </p>

<p> questions allowed a direct comparison of responses about </p>

<p> the D.A.R.E. curricula with responses concerning other </p>

<p> AOD curricula. Only 3% of the districts used only </p>

<p> D.A.R.E.; 46% used only other AOD curricula; and 49% used </p>

<p> both D.A.R.E. and other AOD curricula. </p>

<p> Funding. The first comparisons we examined were </p>

<p> comparisons of funding. We asked respondents to indicate </p>

<p> all sources of funding for the districts' D.A.R.E. and </p>

<p> other AOD programs (Exhibit 5.8). The most frequently </p>

<p> mentioned sources of funding for D.A.R.E. were law </p>

<p> enforcement agencies and DFSCA education funds. The most </p>

<p> frequently mentioned sources of funding for other AOD </p>

<p> programs were DFSCA education funds and school district </p>

<p> funds. D.A.R.E. programs were more likely than other AOD </p>

<p> programs to receive funding from city/county funds, </p>

<p> corporate donations, and individual donations. </p>

<p> Satisfaction with Curricula. Next, we compared </p>

<p> satisfaction ratings for each of the curricula. We asked </p>

<p> the school district drug prevention coordinators to rate </p>

<p> five program components as very satisfactory, </p>

<p> satisfactory, unsatisfactory or very unsatisfactory. The </p>

<p> five components were curriculum, teaching, administrative </p>

<p> requirements, student receptivity, and effects on </p>

<p> students. None of the respondents with D.A.R.E. rated </p>

<p> any of the five components as very unsatisfactory.=20 </p>

<p> Approximately 1% of the respondents with other AOD </p>

<p> programs rated teaching, administrative requirements, or </p>

<p> effects on students as very unsatisfactory. </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. was much more likely than other AOD </p>

<p> programs to be viewed by the school district drug </p>

<p> prevention coordinators as very satisfactory on each of </p>

<p> the five components (Exhibit 5.9). Well over half of the </p>

<p> coordinators with D.A.R.E. rated each of the components </p>

<p> as very satisfactory. Between 23% and 35% of the </p>

<p> coordinators with other AOD programs rated each of the </p>

<p> components as very satisfactory. Students' receptivity </p>

<p> was the component with the highest percentage of </p>

<p> coordinators rating it as very satisfactory for both </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. and other AOD programs. =20 </p>

<p> To determine whether school districts with </p>

<p> particular characteristics were more likely to rate </p>

<p> program components as very satisfactory than other </p>

<p> districts, we examined ratings of each of the components </p>

<p> by these characteristics. Among coordinators with </p>

<p> D.A.R.E., those in high-percentage minority districts </p>

<p> were significantly more likely than those in low- </p>

<p> percentage minority districts to rate student receptivity </p>

<p> as very satisfactory (p&lt;.05) (Exhibit 5.10). Among </p>

<p> coordinators with other AOD programs, those in urban </p>

<p> districts were significantly more likely (p&lt;.05) than </p>

<p> those in rural districts to rate student receptivity and </p>

<p> effects on students as very satisfactory (Exhibit 5.11).=20 </p>

<p> There were no significant differences in components rated </p>

<p> as very satisfactory between D.A.R.E. programs in low and </p>

<p> high SES districts or between other AOD programs in low </p>

<p> and high SES districts. Furthermore, there were no </p>

<p> significant differences in components rated as very </p>

<p> satisfactory between D.A.R.E. programs in small and large </p>

<p> districts or between other AOD programs in small and </p>

<p> large districts. </p>

<p> Support for Curricula. We also asked the school </p>

<p> district drug prevention coordinators to indicate how </p>

<p> supportive they perceived the community, school </p>

<p> personnel, students, parents, law enforcement, and civic </p>

<p> groups to be of D.A.R.E. and other AOD programs.=20 </p>

<p> Response options for these questions were very </p>

<p> supportive, somewhat supportive, and not supportive.=20 </p>

<p> None of the respondents with D.A.R.E. perceived students </p>

<p> or law enforcement as unsupportive of the program (data </p>

<p> not shown). The percentages of coordinators who </p>

<p> perceived any of the listed individuals or agencies as </p>

<p> unsupportive were very small for both D.A.R.E. and other </p>

<p> AOD programs.=20 </p>

<p> of the D.A.R.E. program, followed by students and school </p>

<p> and high-percentage minority districts. Furthermore, </p>

<p> there were no significant differences in support between </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. programs in urban and rural districts or between </p>

<p> other AOD programs in urban and rural districts. </p>

<p> Adaptations of Curricula. Some drug prevention </p>

<p> curricula, such as D.A.R.E., require instructors to </p>

<p> strictly adhere to the curricula and established </p>

<p> procedures. Other curricula allow instructors to adapt </p>

<p> the curricula to meet their particular needs. However, </p>

<p> little is known about how prevention curricula are </p>

<p> actually adapted. We asked the school district drug </p>

<p> prevention coordinators whether D.A.R.E. or other AOD </p>

<p> programs were adapted in any way as a result of gang </p>

<p> activity, drug availability, the racial/ethnic </p>

<p> composition of the district, student or community </p>

<p> poverty, urbanicity, or for some other reason. About 43% </p>

<p> of the coordinators with D.A.R.E. reported adapting </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. for at least one of these reasons, while about </p>

<p> 54% of the coordinators with other AOD programs reported </p>

<p> adapting for one of these reasons. </p>

<p> Exhibit 5.15 presents the percentage adapting </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. and other AOD curricula as a result of the </p>

<p> above-mentioned issues. The most frequently mentioned </p>

<p> reasons for adapting both D.A.R.E. and other AOD programs </p>

<p> were drug availability and student/community poverty. </p>

<p> Respondents with D.A.R.E. were provided with </p>

<p> were adapted. Adaptations mentioned by the coordinators </p>

<p> included: </p>

<p> o targeting particular drugs </p>

<p> prevalent in the area; </p>

<p> o making adaptations for the </p>

<p> physically and mentally </p>

<p> handicapped; </p>

<p> o adding more information on </p>

<p> violence prevention; </p>

<p> o discussing drug abuse in the home </p>

<p> environment; </p>

<p> o teaching students to be more </p>

<p> tolerant of others; </p>

<p> o discussing local drug arrests; </p>

<p> o involving high school students as </p>

<p> role models; </p>

<p> o communicating with families of </p>

<p> youth to gain familial support </p>

<p> and ensure attendance at </p>

<p> graduation; </p>

<p> o taking field trips; and </p>

<p> o omitting lessons. </p>

<p> General Drug Policies </p>

<p> In this final section of Chapter 5, we present </p>

<p> information from responses to questions that were </p>

<p> designed to examine general drug policies in the school </p>

<p> districts. All coordinators responded to these questions </p>

<p> regardless of whether they used D.A.R.E. or any other </p>

<p> drug prevention curricula. =20 </p>

<p> Anti-Drug Policies. We first asked whether the </p>

<p> school district had a written anti-drug policy. We found </p>

<p> that 96% did have such a policy. </p>

<p> Student Assistance Programs. One type of drug </p>

<p> prevention program that many schools have adopted is the </p>

<p> student assistance program (SAP). Modeled after employee </p>

<p> assistance programs (EAPs) in businesses, SAPs conduct </p>

<p> such activities as screening for alcohol and drug </p>

<p> involvement, making referrals, and developing and </p>

<p> coordinating early intervention plans for youth with </p>

<p> problems that could lead to substance abuse. =20 </p>

<p> Almost 55% of the school district drug prevention </p>

<p> coordinators reported that their districts had SAPs in </p>

<p> place during the 1991-1992 school year. Of the 237 </p>

<p> districts with SAPs, 51% targeted these programs to the </p>

<p> elementary school level, 78% focused on the middle/junior </p>

<p> high school level, and 81% targeted the senior high </p>

<p> school level. </p>

<p> We asked the school district drug prevention </p>

<p> coordinators using SAPs to indicate what types of </p>

<p> individuals were trained to participate in these programs </p>

<p> (Exhibit 5.16). Almost 89% of the coordinators mentioned </p>

<p> that teachers had been trained, and nearly 75% mentioned </p>

<p> that principals and guidance counselors had been trained </p>

<p> to participate in SAPs. </p>

<p> We also asked the coordinators using SAPs to </p>

<p> indicate the types of individuals who actually </p>

<p> implemented the programs and how effective they were </p>

<p> (Exhibit 5.17). Coordinators most frequently mentioned </p>

<p> that teachers, principals, guidance counselors, and </p>

<p> students implemented SAPs. However, they perceived </p>

<p> guidance counselors, D.A.R.E. officers, and </p>

<p> district/school nurses as the most effective at </p>

<p> implementing these programs. Coordinators most </p>

<p> frequently mentioned that community professionals and </p>

<p> community volunteers were not effective.=20 </p>

<p> Summary </p>

<p> This chapter focused on the results of our </p>

<p> nationally representative, random sample of 500 school </p>

<p> districts. A total of 429 school district drug </p>

<p> prevention coordinators responded to the survey. Data </p>

<p> presented in this chapter were weighted to take into </p>

<p> account the complex sample design. </p>

<p> Over half of the school districts in the United </p>

<p> States used D.A.R.E. in the 1991-1992 school year.=20 </p>

<p> Additionally, demand for the program is going to increase </p>

<p> over the next few years; two-fifths of those with the </p>

<p> program planned to expand its use and one-fifth of these </p>

<p> without the program plan to begin use. The two other </p>

<p> most frequently used packaged curricula were Quest and </p>

<p> Here's Looking at You, both used by about one-fourth of </p>

<p> the districts. </p>

<p> Only 3% of the districts used only D.A.R.E.; 46% </p>

<p> used only other AOD curricula; and 49% used both D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> and other AOD curricula. Most of the coordinators with </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. reported receiving funding for the program from </p>

<p> law enforcement and/or DFSCA funds. Most of the </p>

<p> coordinators with other AOD programs reported receiving </p>

<p> funding for these programs from DFSCA and/or district </p>

<p> funds. D.A.R.E. was more likely than other AOD programs </p>

<p> to be rated very satisfactory in terms of curriculum, </p>

<p> teaching, administrative requirements, student </p>

<p> receptivity, and effects on students. Furthermore, </p>

<p> coordinators were more likely to indicate that the </p>

<p> community, school personnel, students, parents, law </p>

<p> enforcement, and civic groups were very supportive of </p>

<p> D.A.R.E than of other AOD programs. Around two-fifths of </p>

<p> the coordinators with D.A.R.E. and over one-half the </p>

<p> coordinators with other AOD programs reported adapting </p>

<p> the program to meet their needs. The most common reasons </p>

<p> for adaptation for both D.A.R.E. and other AOD programs </p>

<p> were drug availability and student/community poverty. </p>

<p> Most of the D.A.R.E. programs were administered at </p>

<p> the local level by a single law enforcement agency (i.e., </p>

<p> sheriff's department or city/town police department). In </p>

<p> most districts, coordinators reported that officer </p>

<p> selection and classroom activities were the </p>

<p> responsibility of the police, while school and classroom </p>

<p> selection were the responsibility of education. </p>

<p> Findings from this chapter and resulting </p>

<p> recommendations are discussed fully in Chapter 8. </p>

<p> CHAPTER 6 </p>

<p> SITE VISITS </p>

<p> The final component of the implementation </p>

<p> assessment consisted of site visits to school districts.=20 </p>

<p> We designed these visits to obtain a snapshot of the </p>

<p> organization and operations of D.A.R.E. and other school- </p>

<p> based drug prevention programs. The site visits also </p>

<p> gave us an opportunity to speak with the officers, </p>

<p> teachers, and students directly and to see the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> program in action.=20 </p>

<p> For the site visits, we selected four schools in </p>

<p> three school districts. Two of the school districts were </p>

<p> adjacent to one another in a northern inner-city </p>

<p> environment, with a large minority population and a </p>

<p> substantial drug problem. The third school district was </p>

<p> located in a rural area in the South; it also had a </p>

<p> substantial minority population but less of a drug </p>

<p> problem. The school in one urban school district had </p>

<p> D.A.R.E., and the school in the other urban district did </p>

<p> not have D.A.R.E. In the rural district, one school had </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. and one did not. </p>

<p> Because the school districts and schools were </p>

<p> limited in number and purposively, rather than randomly, </p>

<p> selected, the information gathered from these sites is </p>

<p> not representative of schools in general. We present </p>

<p> data gathered from this component of the assessment to </p>

<p> illustrate and complement findings from other components </p>

<p> of the implementation assessment. We recognize the need </p>

<p> to exercise caution in interpreting site visit findings </p>

<p> and encourage readers to use similar discretion. </p>

<p> For the site visit interviews and observations, we </p>

<p> developed site visit protocols that were based on issues </p>

<p> raised in the previous components of the implementation </p>

<p> assessment. The protocols were designed to elicit </p>

<p> general, open-ended, and free-flowing discussions. We </p>

<p> used protocols instead of structured surveys because we </p>

<p> believed the structured format would inhibit the </p>

<p> exploration of schools' individual characteristics.=20 </p>

<p> Further, we expected respondents would provide us with a </p>

<p> wealth of information that a structured format might have </p>

<p> prevented. We often departed from the protocols to </p>

<p> follow up any line of inquiry that appeared of potential </p>

<p> interest. As a result, the reports from our sites are in </p>

<p> some ways dissimilar. Copies of the protocols can be </p>

<p> found in Appendix D. =20 </p>

<p> Site visits were conducted by two teams. Each team </p>

<p> included at least one senior investigator with </p>

<p> considerable experience in conducting site visits. A </p>

<p> two-person team conducted a 2-day site visit in the urban </p>

<p> schools, and a four-person team conducted a 1-day site </p>

<p> visit in the rural schools. Two or more site visitors </p>

<p> jointly interviewed key individuals, and each interviewer </p>

<p> took notes to reduce the chances of missing key </p>

<p> information. When appropriate, we interviewed up to four </p>

<p> individuals at the same time. </p>

<p> Each team conducted interviews with a variety of </p>

<p> individuals, including </p>

<p> o the coordinator responsible for the </p>

<p> development and implementation of drug </p>

<p> prevention efforts in the school </p>

<p> district; </p>

<p> o individuals teaching drug prevention </p>

<p> curricula to students (including </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. officers at schools with </p>

<p> D.A.R.E.), </p>

<p> o their supervisors (if any), and </p>

<p> o teachers in whose classes D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> officers teach (at D.A.R.E. sites). </p>

<p> When available, we also interviewed others involved in </p>

<p> drug prevention program planning, delivery, or referral </p>

<p> (e.g., representatives of community advisory or drug </p>

<p> action groups). =20 </p>

<p> In each of the two D.A.R.E. schools, the site visit </p>

<p> team monitored a D.A.R.E. lesson and the officer's </p>

<p> activities in the school outside the classroom. We also </p>

<p> observed a drug prevention lesson in both of the schools </p>

<p> without D.A.R.E. We note that both of the classroom </p>

<p> observations in the non-D.A.R.E. schools were conducted </p>

<p> in special education classes. The selection of classes </p>

<p> to be monitored was based on what teacher was teaching </p>

<p> drug prevention the day of our site visit and the </p>

<p> discretion of the school district drug prevention </p>

<p> coordinator. </p>

<p> This chapter contains two sections. In the first, </p>

<p> we discuss drug prevention programming in the urban </p>

<p> schools; and in the second, we describe drug prevention </p>

<p> programming in the rural schools. Within each section, </p>

<p> we present information about the D.A.R.E. school, </p>

<p> followed by information about the non-D.A.R.E. school. </p>

<p> Urban Schools </p>

<p> Urban School with D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> The school we selected received D.A.R.E. after </p>

<p> being on a waiting list for approximately 1 year; all </p>

<p> 5th-grade classes and one 6th-grade class in the school </p>

<p> received D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> We interviewed three individuals involved in the </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. program: </p>

<p> o the police administrator in </p>

<p> charge of the local D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> program (an officer with many </p>

<p> years of experience who had </p>

<p> administered D.A.R.E. for </p>

<p> 5 years); </p>

<p> o a D.A.R.E. officer (involved with </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. for 5 years and </p>

<p> currently teaching 16 classes a </p>

<p> week); =20 </p>

<p> o the school district drug </p>

<p> prevention coordinator.=20 </p>

<p> The following summarizes our discussions with these </p>

<p> respondents. =20 </p>

<p> Administration. According to the police </p>

<p> administrator, the D.A.R.E. program in this city follows </p>

<p> the same procedures employed nationally. He stated that </p>

<p> the local police, State police, and Board of Education </p>

<p> work together to provide the D.A.R.E. program. He </p>

<p> further indicated that this coordination has ensured the </p>

<p> integrity of D.A.R.E.'s implementation, D.A.R.E.'s </p>

<p> consistency with drug education required by the State, </p>

<p> and smooth integration with other drug education </p>

<p> initiatives. =20 </p>

<p> Implementation. Initial steps in the </p>

<p> implementation of the D.A.R.E. program, as reported by </p>

<p> the police administrator, are as follows. The local </p>

<p> police department conducts initial screening of candidate </p>

<p> officers for the D.A.R.E. program. Potential D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> officers are interviewed by the local police department, </p>

<p> and then by the State police. Successfully screened </p>

<p> candidates are sent for a 2-week training program offered </p>

<p> by the State police. After completing the training, </p>

<p> officers are assigned to particular schools or sets of </p>

<p> schools by the local police department. The D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> officer who was interviewed indicated that he is assigned </p>

<p> a general target area and allowed to select the schools </p>

<p> in that area in which he wishes to teach. He indicated </p>

<p> that he and other officers are provided with a list of </p>

<p> schools that have requested D.A.R.E. to guide their </p>

<p> selections. He further reported that no more than 20% of </p>

<p> the schools he selects can be private. </p>

<p> According to the police administrator, a limited </p>

<p> attempt is made to match officer and student </p>

<p> characteristics. For example, he stated that in the </p>

<p> Hispanic community, the local police department attempts </p>

<p> to provide D.A.R.E. officers who can speak Spanish.=20 </p>

<p> Beyond this, however, he indicated that little matching </p>

<p> occurs. =20 </p>

<p> The police administrator said that the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> program is monitored by both the State and local police </p>

<p> departments. He reported that a staff member from the </p>

<p> State police visits each D.A.R.E. instructor during the </p>

<p> year to observe and assess teaching skills and students' </p>

<p> receptiveness to the program, as well as to solicit </p>

<p> feedback from classroom teachers. The administrator also </p>

<p> stated that he monitors classroom activities as part of </p>

<p> his supervisory responsibilities. </p>

<p> According to the police administrator, school </p>

<p> personnel are very supportive of the D.A.R.E. program, in </p>

<p> part because the program is free to the school. The </p>

<p> schools are, thus, able to use their drug prevention </p>

<p> resources for additional drug prevention purposes. </p>

<p> The police administrator indicated that some </p>

<p> teachers get involved in the D.A.R.E. program because of </p>

<p> personal interest, but that most do not. The D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> officer reported that although State policy requires </p>

<p> teachers to remain in the classroom during the lesson, </p>

<p> they assist him only in disciplinary matters. The drug </p>

<p> prevention coordinator indicated that although teachers </p>

<p> do not participate in teaching the lessons, they have </p>

<p> been very receptive both to the program and the officers.=20 </p>

<p> The coordinator noted that teachers cannot be required to </p>

<p> allow D.A.R.E. into their classrooms, and the fact that </p>

<p> no teacher has refused D.A.R.E. indicates the degree of </p>

<p> acceptance that the program enjoys. When asked about </p>

<p> problems between regular teachers and D.A.R.E. officers, </p>

<p> the police administrator reported that although there are </p>

<p> some individuals who do not get along, it is not a </p>

<p> system-wide problem. The D.A.R.E. officer stated that </p>

<p> although principals are supportive of the program, he has </p>

<p> yet to see one in his classes, and that no other school </p>

<p> staff participate in the program. </p>

<p> The police administrator indicated that parental </p>

<p> involvement generally has taken the form of assistance </p>

<p> from the PTA in co-sponsoring D.A.R.E. graduation </p>

<p> ceremonies. However, he stated that the level of </p>

<p> parental involvement varies substantially from one school </p>

<p> to another. The D.A.R.E. officer reported that in his </p>

<p> experience parents generally do not show an active </p>

<p> interest in D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> According to the police administrator, the </p>

<p> investment of the community in the D.A.R.E. program is </p>

<p> limited. He further indicated that D.A.R.E. officers </p>

<p> have little time to seek community involvement: &quot;The </p>

<p> reality is that the D.A.R.E. instructor has a full day </p>

<p> teaching classes; there isn't time to do anything
else.&quot;=20 </p>

<p> The D.A.R.E. officer also reported that community groups </p>

<p> have little participation in the program. </p>

<p> Funding. The police administrator reported that </p>

<p> when the D.A.R.E. program began in this city, much of the </p>

<p> funding came from the Federal Government (i.e., from BJA </p>

<p> through a grant to the State police). He reported that </p>

<p> support received from the State police is currently </p>

<p> limited to training and materials. Salaries of officers </p>

<p> and supervisors are paid by the local police department, </p>

<p> and limited contributions are provided by the community.=20 </p>

<p> According to the police administrator, there is real </p>

<p> danger of D.A.R.E. becoming a victim of budget cuts </p>

<p> because of the current budget crisis; he indicated that </p>

<p> implementation has already been severely restricted </p>

<p> because of lack of resources. </p>

<p> Curriculum. We asked the police administrator </p>

<p> whether the D.A.R.E. curriculum was adapted to meet the </p>

<p> special needs of his area. He responded, &quot;We teach </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. D.A.R.E. is D.A.R.E. Once you decide to use a </p>

<p> program that is administered throughout the country, then </p>

<p> you do not tailor it.&quot; When asked about addressing the </p>

<p> needs resulting from gang activity, he indicated that </p>

<p> officers incorporate their own street experiences and </p>

<p> information they received from the police academy into </p>

<p> the D.A.R.E. gang lessons. He reported that local gangs </p>

<p> and their behaviors are discussed. =20 </p>

<p> The police administrator stated that local D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> advocates believe that classroom activity should be </p>

<p> supported by parental involvement. He, however, did not </p>

<p> express interest in the parent curriculum at this time.=20 </p>

<p> The reasons he gave were that the program is still </p>

<p> experimental and has not been evaluated, the supply of </p>

<p> officers is already inadequate to meet the demand, and </p>

<p> the cost of the parent program would dramatically </p>

<p> increase overall costs (i.e., because the parent </p>

<p> curriculum is generally offered in the evening, officers </p>

<p> would be paid time-and-a-half). The police administrator </p>

<p> stated that &quot;If more money was available, this (parent </p>

<p> curriculum) would certainly be an option the local </p>

<p> department would look into.&quot; </p>

<p> Problems and Improvements. The police </p>

<p> administrator stated, &quot;One of our major problems is that
</p>

<p> we have so few officers and so many schools.&quot; He </p>

<p> indicated that the department tries to &quot;keep D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> moving through the schools&quot; and to cover as many
students </p>

<p> as possible. The administrator reported that although </p>

<p> this rotation policy maximizes the number of schools </p>

<p> reached within the department's limited resources, it </p>

<p> also creates problems (i.e., just about the time the </p>

<p> school becomes accustomed to D.A.R.E., the program is </p>

<p> discontinued and moved to another school). The </p>

<p> administrator reported that many school officials are </p>

<p> angry about this policy. </p>

<p> The police administrator also indicated the need </p>

<p> for more evaluation. He stated, &quot;Evaluation is the only </p>

<p> way to find out what works and what doesn't. I don't </p>

<p> think we're ever going to find that D.A.R.E. solves the </p>

<p> drug problem in the United States, but that it is a first </p>

<p> step. Evaluation must be written into everything. It </p>

<p> has taken too long for evaluations to come about.&quot; He </p>

<p> said that he would at least like to have information on </p>

<p> how effective the program is in suburban, rural, and </p>

<p> inner-city areas. He asked, &quot;If we find the program is </p>

<p> working in a certain area, that's great, but what can we </p>

<p> do in the other areas to enrich the program and diversify </p>

<p> it to meet those needs?&quot; =20 </p>

<p> The D.A.R.E. officer mentioned several problems </p>

<p> areas. First, he indicated that although one of his </p>

<p> schools is heavily Hispanic, it does not have D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> books in Spanish. Second, he stated that the program was </p>

<p> designed for the officer to stay in contact with the </p>

<p> school and that in his current situation, he is in and </p>

<p> out of the school with little chance for further contact </p>

<p> with the students. Finally, he reported the need for </p>

<p> greater recognition of graduates of the program.=20 </p>

<p> &quot;Something should be done to get the parents and </p>

<p> principals more involved so that students feel they have </p>

<p> really accomplished something that has meaning.&quot; </p>

<p> The only problem mentioned by the drug prevention </p>

<p> coordinator was the need for a bilingual officer. </p>

<p> Classroom Observation. We observed a fifth-grade </p>

<p> classroom of 25 students, composed of 6 Hispanics, 4 </p>

<p> African Americans, and 15 Caucasians. Two of the </p>

<p> students spoke limited English and needed translations of </p>

<p> the D.A.R.E. lesson.=20 </p>

<p> The D.A.R.E. instructor was a white male police </p>

<p> officer in his forties who was dressed in regulation </p>

<p> uniform. The officer presented himself to the class as a </p>

<p> friend. The officer's teaching style was very </p>

<p> straightforward and &quot;streetwise,&quot; and he was both
gruff </p>

<p> and engaging. He was very knowledgeable about the </p>

<p> material and taught the whole lesson without notes. The </p>

<p> interaction between officer and students was an easy, </p>

<p> bantering one. </p>

<p> The 40-minute lesson that we observed focused on </p>

<p> the media and how advertisement can be used to persuade </p>

<p> consumers and children to purchase and use different </p>

<p> products. The lesson began with a short introductory </p>

<p> lecture on the influences of advertising and the goals of </p>

<p> the media. The officer then asked students questions </p>

<p> about different products to show them how much they have </p>

<p> learned from the media. The officer gave examples of </p>

<p> different types of advertisements (e.g., &quot;personal </p>

<p> testimony,&quot; &quot;bandwagon&quot;) and also used ads
from magazines </p>

<p> to illustrate his point. Most of the class period (30 </p>

<p> minutes) was spent in interaction. =20 </p>

<p> During the class, the students were rowdy but </p>

<p> attentive. They called out answers to the officer's </p>

<p> questions and felt free to make comments. The students </p>

<p> treated the officer with genuine respect. The interest </p>

<p> and interaction level in this particular lesson was high.=20 </p>

<p> The classroom teacher was present during the </p>

<p> lesson, leaving only once to go to the principal's </p>

<p> office. The teacher sat at the back of the room grading </p>

<p> papers; however, he had a D.A.R.E. book and followed the </p>

<p> lesson as it progressed. Most of the teacher's input </p>

<p> occurred in the beginning of the class before the lesson </p>

<p> got started. The only other time the teacher spoke was </p>

<p> to maintain discipline in the classroom, and then he only </p>

<p> reprimanded talkers. </p>

<p> Once the lesson was completed, the officer left </p>

<p> immediately. There was no evidence of any outside </p>

<p> contact with students. =20 </p>

<p> Urban School Without D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> We interviewed two individuals at the non-D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> school, the drug prevention coordinator for that school </p>

<p> district and the classroom teacher who taught the drug </p>

<p> prevention lesson that we observed. The following </p>

<p> summarizes the discussions with these individuals. </p>

<p> Administration. The drug prevention coordinator </p>

<p> reported that there is no specific drug prevention </p>

<p> program in place. She indicated that drug prevention </p>

<p> textbooks are used and, at times, individuals from </p>

<p> outside the school make presentations at drug prevention </p>

<p> assemblies. According to the coordinator, a teacher </p>

<p> might incorporate a drug prevention lesson into a reading </p>

<p> class or show a video. She stated, &quot;We put together lots
</p>

<p> of little things that add up to something you might call </p>

<p> a program, but we don't have a structured program.&quot; =20 </p>

<p> Implementation. The coordinator indicated that </p>

<p> each student at the school receives drug education </p>

<p> information at least on a monthly basis. However, she </p>

<p> reported that lower grades receive less and in a more </p>

<p> loosely structured format. The teacher reported that he </p>

<p> makes sure his students receive some drug prevention </p>

<p> education every week. According to the coordinator, </p>

<p> classroom teachers do not have specific times set aside </p>

<p> for drug prevention, but rather fit it in when they can.=20 </p>

<p> The seventh and eighth graders do use and follow a drug </p>

<p> prevention textbook and have regular discussions. =20 </p>

<p> The coordinator indicated that teachers' support </p>

<p> for the drug prevention program depended on which teacher </p>

<p> you were talking about. She indicated that all teachers </p>

<p> think that drug prevention education is important, but </p>

<p> that some are far more committed than others to </p>

<p> incorporating drug prevention lessons into their </p>

<p> curriculum. The classroom teacher stated that most of </p>

<p> his fellow teachers support the school's drug prevention </p>

<p> efforts, but that some teachers just did not know how to </p>

<p> talk to students about issues like drugs and gangs. He </p>

<p> stated, &quot;Some either don't know what to say or just
don't </p>

<p> care enough.&quot; =20 </p>

<p> The coordinator reported that law enforcement </p>

<p> personnel have been sporadically involved in the school's </p>

<p> drug prevention activities and have attended local school </p>

<p> council meetings and conducted in-service training with </p>

<p> teachers about drug awareness. She noted that 2 years </p>

<p> ago law enforcement officials came into the school to </p>

<p> work with students targeted as high risk. She stated </p>

<p> that &quot;the success of that program depended upon whether </p>

<p> or not the student accepted the officer.&quot; =20 </p>

<p> When we asked the coordinator about the involvement </p>

<p> of individuals from the community in the school's drug </p>

<p> prevention efforts, she responded that no person from the </p>

<p> community has been involved in implementing the school's </p>

<p> drug prevention program. She indicated that most of the </p>

<p> community has no idea about what the school is doing in </p>

<p> terms of drug prevention education. She stated, &quot;I don't
</p>

<p> think the community feels that it is their place to be </p>

<p> involved.&quot; =20 </p>

<p> Funding. According to the drug prevention </p>

<p> coordinator, there were virtually no drug prevention </p>

<p> activities until the school began receiving money </p>

<p> specifically designated for drug prevention education </p>

<p> (DFSCA) about 3 or 4 years ago. She reported that the </p>

<p> school was currently in its third year of receiving DFSCA </p>

<p> funds and that the amount of funding had steadily </p>

<p> increased over those years. She noted, however, that </p>

<p> this funding cannot be counted on from year to year, and </p>

<p> it is difficult for the school to make long-term plans.=20 </p>

<p> According to the coordinator, the lack of resources </p>

<p> prevents consistency in the school's drug prevention </p>

<p> program. =20 </p>

<p> Curriculum. The drug prevention coordinator </p>

<p> indicated that although all drugs are covered by their </p>

<p> drug prevention efforts, alcohol is targeted. The </p>

<p> coordinator and the classroom teacher both reported that </p>

<p> alcohol is the most widely abused drug among children and </p>

<p> adults in their community. The teacher indicated that he </p>

<p> spends a great deal of time on this issue and that he </p>

<p> spends more time teaching students about self-esteem and </p>

<p> resisting peer pressure than teaching specifically about </p>

<p> drugs. The classroom teacher stated it is a mistake to </p>

<p> spend too much time educating students about the types of </p>

<p> drugs and their effects unless a strong foundation of </p>

<p> self-esteem has first been created. </p>

<p> When we asked whether the school drug prevention </p>

<p> program had been adapted to meet the needs of ethnic </p>

<p> minorities, the coordinator indicated that stereotypes </p>

<p> about who is on drugs and who is selling drugs are </p>

<p> reflected in the materials she has purchased; that is, </p>

<p> many of the pictures are of minorities. If anything, she </p>

<p> felt that white suburbs would have to work more with </p>

<p> adapting materials to fit their population. The </p>

<p> classroom teacher indicated that he was aware of the </p>

<p> cultural diversity in his school and addressed it on an </p>

<p> individual basis with students and their parents. The </p>

<p> teacher expressed frustration about the difficulty of </p>

<p> teaching drug prevention when many of the students live </p>

<p> in homes where the norm is to &quot;drink heavily and abuse </p>

<p> family members.&quot; =20 </p>

<p> Problems and Improvements. The drug prevention </p>

<p> coordinator said that in the future she would like to </p>

<p> purchase a packaged curriculum=FEpossibly D.A.R.E. She </p>

<p> indicated that she did not know very much about D.A.R.E., </p>

<p> but would like information about how to get the program.=20 </p>

<p> One negative factor she reported having heard about </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. is that there is a long waiting list for the </p>

<p> program. She stated, &quot;When you first called and asked if
</p>

<p> we had D.A.R.E., I got excited and thought that someone </p>

<p> was going to give us D.A.R.E.; I don't really know what </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. is, but I assume that because it is in other </p>

<p> schools, it is good.&quot;=20 </p>

<p> The drug prevention coordinator also indicated that </p>

<p> she would like to increase the amount and consistency of </p>

<p> delivery of the drug prevention education program, and to </p>

<p> bring greater structure to. The coordinator and the </p>

<p> classroom teacher both reported that they want to have </p>

<p> the drug prevention program administered by one person </p>

<p> who would come in and take responsibility for the </p>

<p> program. =20 </p>

<p> Classroom Observation. We observed a special </p>

<p> education class of 22 students. It was a remedial class </p>

<p> comprising 14 Hispanics, 6 African Americans, and 2 </p>

<p> Caucasians. There were 12 girls and 10 boys. =20 </p>

<p> The teacher was a white man in his forties, dressed </p>

<p> in a suit and tie. He encouraged the students and drew </p>

<p> on their strengths. He often called on students who </p>

<p> would not otherwise volunteer answers and helped them </p>

<p> formulate answers. When an answer was not exactly </p>

<p> correct, he encouraged the student to think further about </p>

<p> the question asked. The teacher carefully and adequately </p>

<p> answered students' questions. </p>

<p> The topic of the observed lesson concerned the </p>

<p> functioning of the lung and heart. This was a lesson </p>

<p> designed to provide students with background information </p>

<p> about the human body, before the impact of drugs on the </p>

<p> body's major organs were discussed. The teacher followed </p>

<p> the textbook closely. Because the students were slow </p>

<p> learners, he altered the lesson slightly by asking the </p>

<p> students to read sections aloud and then immediately </p>

<p> asking questions about the section just covered. Most </p>

<p> students appeared interested in the lesson. They </p>

<p> followed along in the textbook and answered questions </p>

<p> with sincerity. A few students consistently put their </p>

<p> hands up to answer questions, but most were quiet. There </p>

<p> were no discipline problems during the class. After </p>

<p> class, we asked the teacher whether he ever used group </p>

<p> discussions. He reported that this group of students was </p>

<p> too remedial to use a discussion format. =20 </p>

<p> Rural Schools </p>

<p> Rural School with D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> The D.A.R.E. program in the rural district employed </p>

<p> four D.A.R.E. officers. We interviewed five individuals, </p>

<p> including: </p>

<p> o the police administrator in charge of the </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. program, </p>

<p> o a D.A.R.E. officer, </p>

<p> o the school district drug prevention </p>

<p> coordinator, </p>

<p> o the school guidance counselor, and </p>

<p> o the teacher in whose class the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> officer taught. </p>

<p> The following summarizes our discussions with these </p>

<p> respondents. </p>

<p> Administration. The police administrator indicated </p>

<p> that the D.A.R.E. program was administered by the city </p>

<p> police department. He reported that this was the first </p>

<p> semester that D.A.R.E. had been offered in this </p>

<p> particular school. He stated that the agreement between </p>

<p> the school and police department is informal. </p>

<p> Implementation. The police administrator reported </p>

<p> that the initial steps in implementing the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> program include selection of a D.A.R.E. officer by the </p>

<p> local police department, approval of the officer by the </p>

<p> State police, and training for the officer at a D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> training course. </p>

<p> The officer reported that there are no problems </p>

<p> coordinating D.A.R.E. activities. He stated that there </p>

<p> is &quot;eagerness from all sides to make the program
work.&quot;=20 </p>

<p> According to the officer, some classroom teachers </p>

<p> participate in the lesson, but most do not. He further </p>

<p> indicated that much of the time students are just as </p>

<p> receptive without the teacher present. </p>

<p> The D.A.R.E. officer indicated that parents are </p>

<p> becoming more involved in the program. He stated that </p>

<p> they are very interested and supportive of D.A.R.E., and </p>

<p> that his attendance at nonclassroom school functions, </p>

<p> such as Friday night dances, has greatly improved his </p>

<p> relationships with parents. He reported that he hopes to </p>

<p> receive training on the D.A.R.E. parent curriculum as </p>

<p> soon as possible. </p>

<p> According to the officer and the police </p>

<p> administrator, there was little community involvement.=20 </p>

<p> They attributed this to the program being new and hoped </p>

<p> that there would be more community involvement in the </p>

<p> coming semesters. However, the coordinator did report </p>

<p> that D.A.R.E. is well received by the &quot;educated&quot; </p>

<p> community. He indicated that churches in the community </p>

<p> have not been particularly receptive and simply do not </p>

<p> want to get involved. The coordinator and the guidance </p>

<p> counselor saw the lack of involvement by churches as a </p>

<p> loss to the program. </p>

<p> According to the school counselor, students' </p>

<p> attitudes toward police had changed considerably since </p>

<p> the D.A.R.E. lessons began. She stated that &quot;students </p>

<p> now see the officer as a friend instead of someone to </p>

<p> avoid.&quot; </p>

<p> Funding. The police administrator reported that </p>

<p> the police department funds the salary of the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> officer, while the school pays any costs for the </p>

<p> curriculum (i.e., books, materials). The school district </p>

<p> coordinator indicated that the school did not have the </p>

<p> funds to purchase D.A.R.E. T-shirts and related </p>

<p> paraphernalia. He further stated that the district is </p>

<p> seeking a State grant for additional supplies. </p>

<p> Curriculum. The guidance counselor reported that </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. classes are a &quot;wonderful way of teaching </p>

<p> students to say no&quot; and that the self-esteem modules are
</p>

<p> particularly valuable and effective. According to the </p>

<p> district coordinator, D.A.R.E. complements all their </p>

<p> other drug prevention programs, but that unfortunately </p>

<p> there was little coordination between different </p>

<p> curricula.=20 </p>

<p> The D.A.R.E. officer reported that he does not </p>

<p> target the curriculum to any particular substances and </p>

<p> does not adapt the curriculum to specific ethnic needs.=20 </p>

<p> He indicated that he does teach the gang lesson (as do </p>

<p> most D.A.R.E. officers in the State), even though in this </p>

<p> community there is little gang activity. </p>

<p> Problems and Improvements. The guidance counselor </p>

<p> indicated that she would like the school to provide </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. in all classrooms in grades 5 through 7. The </p>

<p> guidance counselor and the classroom teacher indicated </p>

<p> the need for the school to offer D.A.R.E. or some other </p>

<p> drug prevention education at earlier grade levels.=20 </p>

<p> According to the counselor, &quot;Trying to teach drug </p>

<p> prevention education in high school is futile.&quot; </p>

<p> The classroom teacher indicated that D.A.R.E. and </p>

<p> other programs need to focus more on at-risk children.=20 </p>

<p> She indicated that there are some 15- and 16-year-olds </p>

<p> still in the 6th grade. She reported that these students </p>

<p> usually have poor attendance records, are poorly </p>

<p> motivated, and are frequently in trouble. She stated </p>

<p> that current prevention programs, including D.A.R.E., are </p>

<p> not adequately meeting the needs of these students.=20 </p>

<p> The district coordinator indicated that one problem </p>

<p> has been the lack of ongoing evaluations of D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> Classroom Observation. We observed a fifth-grade </p>

<p> class of 22 students, 12 boys and 10 girls. Twenty </p>

<p> students were African American, and two students were </p>

<p> Caucasian. </p>

<p> The D.A.R.E. officer was a white man in his </p>

<p> thirties who was dressed in regulation uniform. The </p>

<p> officer presented himself as a &quot;big brother,&quot;
someone </p>

<p> whom the students could seek out if they needed guidance </p>

<p> or assistance. The officer brought the D.A.R.E. mascot-- </p>

<p> the D.A.R.E. bear--with him to class. </p>

<p> The lesson that we observed focused on alternatives </p>

<p> to drug use. The officer discussed how athletics could </p>

<p> be used as an alternative to drug involvement. He used </p>

<p> examples of well-known, drug-free athletes. The officer </p>

<p> encouraged students to ask questions. He also used a </p>

<p> &quot;D.A.R.E. question box.&quot; In the previous week,
students </p>

<p> had been asked to write questions for the officer and </p>

<p> place them in the box. During the lesson, he drew a </p>

<p> question from the box and answered that question. For </p>

<p> the remainder of the lesson, the officer took the </p>

<p> students outside to play games to illustrate alternatives </p>

<p> to drug use. He also involved the school's gym teacher </p>

<p> in supervising the games. </p>

<p> During the class, students were interested and </p>

<p> inquisitive. They seemed to feel free to ask the officer </p>

<p> questions. There were no disciplinary problems. The </p>

<p> classroom teacher remained present during most of the </p>

<p> lesson, sitting at the back of the room and grading </p>

<p> papers. =20 </p>

<p> The officer seemed to spend a great deal of time in </p>

<p> the school. After the lesson was over, he talked to </p>

<p> students in the hallway. Indeed, almost all students </p>

<p> seemed to know him. When an emergency occurred (a </p>

<p> student fell and broke his arm) and the principal was not </p>

<p> present, the staff sought the officer's assistance. This </p>

<p> was not the first such occurrence, and we learned that </p>

<p> the school staff relied frequently upon the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> officer to act as a sort of assistant principal.=20 </p>

<p> Clearly, he was viewed as an integral--and important-- </p>

<p> part of the school staff. </p>

<p> Rural School Without D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> We interviewed four individuals at the non-D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> school, including the school district drug prevention </p>

<p> coordinator (who was the same for both rural schools), </p>

<p> the supervisor of health services, and two members of a </p>

<p> local advisory board for substance abuse. The following </p>

<p> summarizes discussions with these individuals. </p>

<p> Administration. Coordination of the drug </p>

<p> prevention efforts in the observed non-D.A.R.E. school </p>

<p> and other such schools in the community rests with the </p>

<p> school district drug prevention coordinator. He </p>

<p> indicated that there are a variety of programs currently </p>

<p> available to schools but that implementation and </p>

<p> coordination are sporadic. </p>

<p> Implementation. According to the coordinator, </p>

<p> parents in this school are becoming more aware of the </p>

<p> drug problem and are beginning to ask what they can do to </p>

<p> get involved. He stated that many parents are realizing </p>

<p> that they cannot &quot;send their kids to school to get </p>

<p> fixed,&quot; and so are starting to take responsibility for </p>

<p> their children's problems. He also indicated that school </p>

<p> personnel are becoming more involved.=20 </p>

<p> Funding. According to the district coordinator, </p>

<p> the school receives most of its drug prevention funds </p>

<p> from DFSCA. He also indicated funds were provided by the </p>

<p> school board and a local university, as well as the </p>

<p> Indian Education Act. These latter resources, however, </p>

<p> could only be spent on programs delivered to Native </p>

<p> American children. </p>

<p> Curriculum. According to the coordinator, a </p>

<p> variety of curricula are available to teachers at this </p>

<p> school, but not all teachers use the same curriculum, and </p>

<p> some do not provide drug prevention education at all.=20 </p>

<p> The coordinator reported that Here's Looking at You 2000 </p>

<p> is one package available to teachers in this school.=20 </p>

<p> However, he indicated that only about half the teachers </p>

<p> had been trained to teach this program. </p>

<p> The advisory board members informed us of a </p>

<p> community drug abuse treatment program currently in use </p>

<p> in this and other area schools that follows the
&quot;12-step&quot; </p>

<p> model. This program offers intervention, education, and </p>

<p> prevention to youth who have been suspended for substance </p>

<p> use, as well as to their families. One board member </p>

<p> stated that suspended youth must attend this program </p>

<p> before returning to school. </p>

<p> The coordinator indicated that the SAP is just now </p>

<p> being implemented in this school. </p>

<p> The health supervisor reported that the school also </p>

<p> sponsors Red Ribbon week, a program sponsored by the </p>

<p> National Federation of Parents that invites youth and </p>

<p> community members to pledge their support for drug-free </p>

<p> lives by displaying red ribbons. </p>

<p> Problems and Improvements. All individuals </p>

<p> interviewed indicated the need for greater coordination </p>

<p> between the different types of drug prevention programs, </p>

<p> as well as assessments of drug prevention efforts. The </p>

<p> coordinator reported that he would like to have someone </p>

<p> responsible for the delivery of drug prevention programs </p>

<p> in the school and someone responsible for evaluation. He </p>

<p> said that &quot;a lot of people are working very hard, but </p>

<p> have little idea of whether or not their efforts are </p>

<p> successful.&quot; </p>

<p> The coordinator indicated that time is also a major </p>

<p> problem in the delivery of drug prevention education. He </p>

<p> stated that preparing students for end of the year </p>

<p> testing takes up most of the classroom teachers' time and </p>

<p> allows them little time to teach drug prevention. </p>

<p> Classroom Observation. We observed a 5th grade </p>

<p> class of three girls and seven boys. This was a class </p>

<p> for exceptional children that included students with </p>

<p> emotional and behavioral problems. Five of the students </p>

<p> were Caucasian, three were African-American, and two were </p>

<p> Native American. </p>

<p> The instructor was an African-American woman in her </p>

<p> twenties. She used an approachable and upbeat teaching </p>

<p> style. She was careful to include all of the students in </p>

<p> the lesson. </p>

<p> Because this was a class for exceptional children, </p>

<p> the teacher tailored the drug lesson to the students.=20 </p>

<p> The teacher drew her lesson from health textbooks used in </p>

<p> regular classes. The lesson lasted approximately 1 hour.=20 </p>

<p> The teacher indicated that the length of the class and </p>

<p> how much time she spends on the drug lesson generally </p>

<p> depends both on her assessment of how much of the lesson </p>

<p> the students are absorbing and their interest level. She </p>

<p> indicated that drug prevention lessons are usually taught </p>

<p> two or three times a week. </p>

<p> The observed lesson was about learning how to make </p>

<p> healthy choices. Topics included why people smoke and </p>

<p> use drugs, how magazine advertisements promote smoking </p>

<p> and drinking, and the differences between drugs that are </p>

<p> helpful and harmful. The teacher covered a wide range of </p>

<p> concepts, including how self-esteem and peer pressure </p>

<p> contribute to drug use, the importance of reading warning </p>

<p> labels on medications, and techniques advertisements use </p>

<p> to glamorize drug use. The class format was primarily </p>

<p> question and answer, and the teacher encouraged each </p>

<p> student to participate. The teacher used a variety of </p>

<p> visual aids, including charts, examples of magazine ads, </p>

<p> and a collection of common medications that can be </p>

<p> inappropriately used. </p>

<p> For the most part, the students were very </p>

<p> attentive. Most were eager to be called on and to </p>

<p> participate in the class. The teacher encouraged </p>

<p> participation by all the students. </p>

<p> Summary </p>

<p> This chapter focused on site visits to four schools </p>

<p> in three school districts. Two of the schools were </p>

<p> located in one rural school district; one of these </p>

<p> schools had D.A.R.E. and one did not. The other two </p>

<p> schools were located in adjacent school districts in an </p>

<p> urban area; again, one school had D.A.R.E. and one did </p>

<p> not. </p>

<p> In both of the schools with D.A.R.E., limited </p>

<p> participation of teachers, parents, and the community </p>

<p> were reported. Both schools also mentioned having </p>

<p> inadequate resources for the program. Neither school </p>

<p> reported adapting the curriculum for any reason. In both </p>

<p> schools, the need for ongoing, long-term evaluations was </p>

<p> stressed. </p>

<p> Neither of the non-D.A.R.E. schools had a specific </p>

<p> drug prevention program. Both reported that </p>

<p> implementation and coordination was sporadic. Both </p>

<p> schools reported wanting one person who would be </p>

<p> responsible for administering the drug prevention program </p>

<p> in the school. </p>

<p> CHAPTER 7 </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. OUTCOME ASSESSMENT </p>

<p> Project D.A.R.E. is a drug use prevention program </p>

<p> with curricula targeted at elementary, middle, and senior </p>

<p> high school students. The original core curriculum used </p>

<p> in elementary schools is the subject of this review (a </p>

<p> revised core curriculum will be implemented in September </p>

<p> 1994). The junior and senior high school curricula are </p>

<p> not included in the review because they are more recent, </p>

<p> not as prevalent, and generally have not been evaluated.=20 </p>

<p> Future evaluation efforts should focus on these </p>

<p> curricula, as well as on the cumulative effects of the </p>

<p> comprehensive program. </p>

<p> The purpose of the current review is to assess the </p>

<p> short-term effectiveness of the original D.A.R.E. core </p>

<p> curriculum by using meta-analytic techniques to </p>

<p> synthesize the evaluation findings of several studies.=20 </p>

<p> We searched for all D.A.R.E. evaluations, both published </p>

<p> and unpublished, conducted over the past 10 years (i.e., </p>

<p> since D.A.R.E. originated) and selected for further </p>

<p> review those studies that met specified methodological </p>

<p> criteria. To establish a comparable measure of </p>

<p> effectiveness across studies, we calculated effect sizes </p>

<p> for each study. In addition, to put D.A.R.E. in the </p>

<p> context of other school-based drug use prevention </p>

<p> programs, we compared the average magnitude of the effect </p>

<p> sizes for D.A.R.E. with those of other programs that </p>

<p> target youth of similar age. </p>

<p> This chapter covers six topics. First, we briefly </p>

<p> summarize the original D.A.R.E. core curriculum. Second, </p>

<p> we provide some general background on meta-analysis and </p>

<p> describe the methodological criteria used to select </p>

<p> evaluations for the review. Third, we identify the eight </p>

<p> studies that met the criteria and provide an overall </p>

<p> description of these studies. Fourth, we examine the </p>

<p> reported immediate effects of D.A.R.E., based on these </p>

<p> studies. Fifth, we compare the D.A.R.E. effect sizes </p>

<p> averaged across studies with the average effect sizes of </p>

<p> other drug use prevention programs. Finally, we discuss </p>

<p> several methodological considerations related to the </p>

<p> evaluations included in our review that are important to </p>

<p> interpretation of the results. Further discussion of the </p>

<p> results is included in Chapter 8 of this report. </p>

<p> The D.A.R.E. Core Curriculum </p>

<p> The D.A.R.E. core curriculum is offered to pupils </p>

<p> in the last year of elementary school, typically fifth or </p>

<p> sixth grade. The 17 lessons in the core curriculum are </p>

<p> usually offered once a week for 45 to 60 minutes. The </p>

<p> lessons focus on teaching pupils the skills they need in </p>

<p> order to recognize and resist social pressures to use </p>

<p> drugs. In addition to information about drugs, lessons </p>

<p> emphasize decisionmaking skills, building self-esteem, </p>

<p> and choosing healthy alternatives to drug use. Officers </p>

<p> use a variety of teaching methods, including lectures, </p>

<p> group discussions, question-and-answer sessions, </p>

<p> audiovisual materials, workbook exercises, and role- </p>

<p> plays. </p>

<p> Several aspects of the D.A.R.E. core curriculum </p>

<p> suggest that it should be successful as a drug use </p>

<p> prevention curriculum. First, the curriculum includes </p>

<p> elements of prevention strategies generally thought to be </p>

<p> effective, such as emphasis on peer resistance and social </p>

<p> competence skills (Botvin, 1990; Hansen, 1992). Interac- </p>

<p> tive programs have shown more promise than those using </p>

<p> more traditional teaching methods (Tobler, 1986, in </p>

<p> press, 1994), and at least some of D.A.R.E.'s teaching </p>

<p> strategies encourage role-playing and interactions among </p>

<p> pupils. Also, the core curriculum is offered to children </p>

<p> at the age when they are believed to be most receptive to </p>

<p> antidrug use messages, which is just before experimenta- </p>

<p> tion with drugs begins (BJA, 1988; Oetting &amp; Bauvais, </p>

<p> 1990). In addition, the program targets cigarettes, </p>

<p> alcohol, and marijuana--the &quot;gateway drugs&quot; that
children </p>

<p> tend to experiment with first (Ellickson, Hays, &amp; Bell, </p>

<p> 1992; Kandel, 1975). Finally, the structured nature of </p>

<p> the curriculum and extensive training of the officers </p>

<p> helps ensure that the program is implemented as designed </p>

<p> (BJA, 1988). </p>

<p> Meta-Analysis Background and Study Selection Criteria </p>

<p> Meta-analysis is a methodology for integrating the </p>

<p> research findings of a body of studies (Bangert-Drowns, </p>

<p> 1986; Cook et al., 1993). The purpose of meta-analysis </p>

<p> is to discover whether some pattern of results is </p>

<p> discernible in a set of studies pertaining to the same </p>

<p> research question (Bangert-Drowns, 1986; Glass, McGaw, &amp; </p>

<p> Smith, 1981; Rosenthal, 1991). Meta-analysis differs </p>

<p> from a traditional narrative review of studies by </p>

<p> providing statistical techniques for summarizing the </p>

<p> research findings from the studies. By quantifying </p>

<p> outcomes across studies and making them comparable with </p>

<p> each other, meta-analysis provides an objective rather </p>

<p> than subjective basis for drawing conclusions about </p>

<p> patterns of study results. </p>

<p> Three basic steps are commonly followed in </p>

<p> conducting meta-analyses (Bangert-Drowns, 1986). First, </p>

<p> all relevant studies are collected, and some studies are </p>

<p> selected for inclusion according to a set of a priori </p>

<p> defined methodological criteria. Second, effect sizes </p>

<p> are calculated for each study. Effect sizes represent </p>

<p> the statistical outcomes of each study transformed to a </p>

<p> common metric. This transformation allows comparisons </p>

<p> across different scales of different outcome measures.=20 </p>

<p> Third, effect sizes for the set of studies are averaged.=20 </p>

<p> In addition, explanations for variability in effect sizes </p>

<p> across studies usually are tested. We followed these </p>

<p> three steps in conducting our assessment of the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> core curriculum; we did not, however, examine possible </p>

<p> causes of differences in outcomes across the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> studies (e.g., differences in D.A.R.E. outcomes by the </p>

<p> racial/ethnic composition of the study samples). The </p>

<p> relatively small number of D.A.R.E. studies precluded </p>

<p> this type of analysis. </p>

<p> In selecting studies, our review focused on </p>

<p> student-based, quantitative evaluations of D.A.R.E. that </p>

<p> measured program effects on drug use behavior and/or </p>

<p> other outcomes targeted by the D.A.R.E. core curriculum, </p>

<p> such as attitudes about drug use. Evaluations that </p>

<p> reported only subjective assessments or satisfaction </p>

<p> ratings are outside the scope of this review. We also </p>

<p> did not consider the results of parent, teacher, </p>

<p> administrator, or D.A.R.E. officer surveys, which </p>

<p> sometimes were conducted as part of the total evaluation </p>

<p> effort. (For information about the opinions of school </p>

<p> district drug prevention coordinators concerning </p>

<p> D.A.R.E., see Chapter 5.) It should be noted that there </p>

<p> are many possible D.A.R.E. outcomes of importance other </p>

<p> than the ones we examined in this meta-analysis, such as </p>

<p> improved school and police relations and greater trust in </p>

<p> law enforcement among youth. </p>

<p> We attempted to locate all the quantitative </p>

<p> evaluations of the original D.A.R.E. core curriculum </p>

<p> conducted to date through a survey of D.A.R.E.'s five </p>

<p> RTCs, telephone interviews with individuals known to be </p>

<p> involved with D.A.R.E., and computerized searches of the </p>

<p> published and unpublished literature using several data </p>

<p> bases. The computerized data bases included ERIC, </p>

<p> PsychINFO, and Dissertation Abstracts Online.=20 </p>

<p> Through the combined sources, we identified 18 </p>

<p> quantitative D.A.R.E. evaluations conducted in 12 States </p>

<p> and one Canadian province. The location and primary </p>

<p> reference for each evaluation are shown in Exhibit 7.1.=20 </p>

<p> Several of the evaluations were reported in multiple </p>

<p> reports or papers; we generally used the final, most </p>

<p> complete report or the published paper for our review. </p>

<p> From the 18 studies, we selected studies to include </p>

<p> in our meta-analysis that met the following criteria:=20 </p>

<p> (a) use of a control or comparison group; (b) pretest- </p>

<p> posttest design or posttest only with random assignment; </p>

<p> and (c) use of reliably operationalized quantitative </p>

<p> outcome measures. Quasi-experimental studies were </p>

<p> excluded if they did not control for preexisting </p>

<p> differences on measured outcomes with either change </p>

<p> scores or covariance adjusted means (Tobler, in press, </p>

<p> 1994). In addition, to ensure the comparability of </p>

<p> results, we used only results based on immediate </p>

<p> posttest. There were an insufficient number of long-term </p>

<p> evaluation studies to adequately assess the longer-term </p>

<p> effects of the core curriculum. </p>

<p> We selected these criteria because they help to </p>

<p> ensure confidence in the study results by removing a </p>

<p> number of alternative explanations, other than true </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. impact, that could account for outcomes </p>

<p> observed. For example, the first criterion, a comparison </p>

<p> group made up of schools and/or subjects that did not </p>

<p> receive the curriculum, makes it possible to determine </p>

<p> whether changes in the D.A.R.E. youth are unique to them </p>

<p> or are shared by other youth. If youth receiving and not </p>

<p> receiving D.A.R.E. change on some outcome of interest, </p>

<p> then the cause is due to some other factor, such as </p>

<p> maturation, rather than to D.A.R.E. Pretest measures </p>

<p> (the second criterion) are neededExhibit 7.1 D.A.R.E.

<p> *Study selected for further review (with State </p>

<p> abbreviation). </p>

<p> for testing the assumption that the D.A.R.E. and </p>

<p> comparison groups are equivalent at the outset. In the </p>

<p> absence of random assignment, this assumption must be </p>

<p> tested. In addition, pretest measures provide a </p>

<p> benchmark for evaluating changes in outcome measures </p>

<p> after program implementation. Reliably operationalized </p>

<p> measures of the outcomes of interest (the third </p>

<p> criterion) are important for ensuring that the constructs </p>

<p> intended to be measured are the ones actually measured.=20 </p>

<p> For example, for assessing outcomes related to knowledge, </p>

<p> attitudes, and skills, we considered multiple item scales </p>

<p> to be more reliable than single-item measures. </p>

<p> We also examined a number of other methodological </p>

<p> features, such as the correspondence between the unit of </p>

<p> assignment and unit of analysis, whether a panel design </p>

<p> was used, whether schools in the intervention and </p>

<p> comparison conditions were matched, and whether attrition </p>

<p> rates were reported and examined. Although these factors </p>

<p> were considered in assessing the overall methodological </p>

<p> rigor of the studies, no evaluations were eliminated on </p>

<p> the basis of these criteria. </p>

<p> Studies Selected </p>

<p> Eight of the original 18 evaluation studies met the </p>

<p> criteria for inclusion in the review. One additional </p>

<p> study met the methodological criteria but did not </p>

<p> administer the first posttest until 1 year after D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> implementation and so could not be included in the </p>

<p> analysis of immediate effects (Nyre &amp; Rose, 1987; Nyre, </p>

<p> Rose, &amp; Bolus, 1987). The eight evaluations are </p>

<p> indicated by an asterisk (*) in Exhibit 7.1.=20 </p>

<p> Characteristics of the studies are summarized in Exhibit </p>

<p> 7.2. A more complete description of each study is </p>

<p> provided in Appendix B. </p>

<p> Each of the evaluations represented a State or </p>

<p> local (e.g., city, school district) effort using either </p>

<p> the entire population of schools in a locale or a </p>

<p> convenience sample. The number of student subjects in </p>

<p> all studies was large; each study included at least 10 </p>

<p> schools and approximately 500 to 2000 students in the </p>

<p> combined D.A.R.E. and control groups. Demographic </p>

<p> information about each sample, including gender, </p>

<p> race/ethnicity, SES, and metropolitan status, was not </p>

<p> consistently given across studies. Based on the </p>

<p> information available, the samples were about equally </p>

<p> divided between girls and boys; included white, </p>

<p> black/African American, Hispanic, and Asian-American </p>

<p> youth, with whites usually in the majority; and </p>

<p> represented urban, suburban, and rural areas.=20 </p>

<p> Information was generally not given on the SES of the </p>

<p> sample. </p>

<p> Assignment of D.A.R.E. to intervention and control </p>

<p> groups was by school for all eight studies. In one </p>

<p> study, D.A.R.E. was also assigned by classroom in certain </p>

<p> schools (Manos et al., 1986). Because the control group </p>

<p> classrooms in that study were potentially contaminated by </p>

<p> their close proximity to D.A.R.E. classrooms, these </p>

<p> control classrooms were eliminated; only control schools </p>

<p> with no D.A.R.E. classes were included. Two of the </p>

<p> studies used a true experimental design in which schools </p>

<p> were randomly assigned to D.A.R.E. or control conditions; </p>

<p> a third study used random assignment for two-thirds of </p>

<p> the schools. The remaining five evaluations used a </p>

<p> nonequivalent control group quasi-experimental design.=20 </p>

<p> For these, assignment was based on some other criterion; </p>

<p> if the criterion was stated, usually it was the </p>

<p> administrative convenience of either the school district </p>

<p> or law enforcement agency.=20 </p>

<p> A fundamental consideration in reviewing the </p>

<p> studies was the equivalence of the D.A.R.E. and control </p>

<p> groups before the intervention. Because there were </p>

<p> relatively few sampling units across studies (ranging </p>

<p> from 11 to 63 schools, with under 40 schools in all </p>

<p> except one study), it is unlikely that equivalence </p>

<p> between groups was obtained without prior matching or </p>

<p> blocking of schools, even with randomization. Only half </p>

<p> the studies matched comparison schools on selected </p>

<p> demographic characteristics. The majority of studies </p>

<p> (75%), however, assessed the equivalency of the </p>

<p> comparison groups at pretest and made adjustments for </p>

<p> pretest differences on demographic characteristics. All </p>

<p> studies adjusted for pretest differences on outcome </p>

<p> measures. </p>

<p> 3Attrition rates reported only. All but one of the studies
used a pan= </p>

<p> el </p>

<p> design that </p>

<p> matched subjects from pretest to posttest using a unique </p>

<p> identification code. </p>

<p> Outcome measures used in the studies were based on </p>

<p> responses to self-administered questionnaires. Seven of </p>

<p> the eight studies used measures that were standardized </p>

<p> scales or derived from existing measures; six studies </p>

<p> reported scale reliabilities (usually Cronbach's alpha) </p>

<p> that were generally high. Validity information, however, </p>

<p> was rarely reported, and none of the studies used either </p>

<p> a biochemical indicator or &quot;bogus pipeline&quot;
technique to </p>

<p> validate self-reports of drug use. Informing youth that </p>

<p> their self-reports of drug use will be verified by a </p>

<p> biological specimen (e.g., saliva) or a purported lie </p>

<p> detector (i.e., bogus pipeline) is believed to enhance </p>

<p> the validity of their responses (Bauman &amp; Dent, 1982). </p>

<p> As is unfortunately typical of school-based </p>

<p> evaluation studies, most (75%) of the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> evaluations did not use a data analysis strategy </p>

<p> appropriate to the unit of assignment. Because schools, </p>

<p> not students, were assigned to D.A.R.E. and control </p>

<p> conditions, it would have been appropriate to analyze the </p>

<p> data by schools with subjects' data aggregated within </p>

<p> each school or to use an analysis strategy that accounts </p>

<p> for clustered data (Moskowitz, 1993; Murray &amp; Hannan, </p>

<p> 1990). Six of the studies ignored schools altogether and </p>

<p> analyzed individual subjects' data, thereby violating the </p>

<p> statistical assumption of independence of observations.=20 </p>

<p> The result of ignoring schools as the unit of analysis is </p>

<p> a positive bias toward finding statistically significant </p>

<p> program effects (Murray &amp; Hannan, 1990). </p>

<p> Five of the studies reported attrition rates, which </p>

<p> generally were small. None of the three studies that </p>

<p> analyzed attrition rates found that attrition differed </p>

<p> significantly across experimental and control conditions.=20 </p>

<p> In addition, subjects absent from the posttest were not </p>

<p> more likely to be drug users or at risk for drug use.=20 </p>

<p> Although attrition usually is greater among drug users </p>

<p> (Biglan &amp; Ary, 1985), given the young age of the sample, </p>

<p> when dropping out of school is unlikely and drug use </p>

<p> prevalence is low, these results are not surprising. </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. Effect Sizes </p>

<p> To assess the impact of the original D.A.R.E. core </p>

<p> curriculum on youth drug use, as well as on other </p>

<p> outcomes targeted by the curriculum, we calculated effect </p>

<p> sizes. An effect size (ES) is defined as the difference </p>

<p> between the mean for the intervention group (MeanI) and </p>

<p> the mean for the control group (MeanC), standardized by </p>

<p> dividing by the pooled standard deviation (SD): [ES =3D </p>

<p> (MeanI - MeanC)/ SD] (Hedges &amp; Olkin, 1985; Perry &amp; </p>

<p> Tobler, 1992; Rosenthal, 1991). If means and standard </p>

<p> deviations are not available, effect sizes can be </p>

<p> calculated using formulae developed to convert other test </p>

<p> statistics (such as, t or F), as well as percentages, to </p>

<p> effect sizes (Perry &amp; Tobler, 1992). </p>

<p> Effect sizes are expressed as standard deviation </p>

<p> units and may be positive or negative. A positive effect </p>

<p> size indicates an effect in the desired direction as a </p>

<p> result of the intervention. An effect size of 1, for </p>

<p> example, indicates that the intervention group performed </p>

<p> one standard deviation unit better than the control group </p>

<p> on some outcome of interest. Although there are no clear </p>

<p> conventions for defining &quot;small,&quot;
&quot;medium,&quot; and &quot;large&quot; </p>

<p> effect sizes in the context of drug use prevention </p>

<p> programs, review of several meta-analyses of adolescent </p>

<p> drug use prevention programs (Bangert-Drowns, 1988; </p>

<p> Bruvold, 1993; Bruvold &amp; Rundall, 1988; Tobler, 1986, in </p>

<p> press, 1992 ) suggests that effect sizes below .15 </p>

<p> reflect a small effect; effect sizes between .15 and .30 </p>

<p> indicate a modest effect; and effect sizes above .30 </p>

<p> reflect stronger program effects. </p>

<p> For each of the eight D.A.R.E. studies, we </p>

<p> calculated effect sizes to quantify the magnitude of </p>

<p> D.A.R.E.'s effectiveness with respect to six outcomes </p>

<p> that reflect the aims of the D.A.R.E. curriculum. The </p>

<p> six outcomes were knowledge about drugs, attitudes about </p>

<p> drug use, social skills, self-esteem, attitude toward </p>

<p> police, and self-reported drug use. We calculated effect </p>

<p> sizes using the procedure appropriate for the summary </p>

<p> statistics reported. In all cases, we used statistics </p>

<p> reflecting covariance-adjusted means, with pretest values </p>

<p> as covariates, rather than unadjusted means so that any </p>

<p> differences between the comparison groups prior to the </p>

<p> intervention would not be reflected in the effect sizes </p>

<p> (Tobler, in press, 1994). Where possible, we used </p>

<p> statistics that also were adjusted for sample demographic </p>

<p> characteristics (six of eight studies). </p>

<p> Some studies did not include all six outcomes of </p>

<p> interest, and some outcomes were measured by more than </p>

<p> one indicator. When multiple indicators were used, such </p>

<p> as two measures of social skills, we calculated separate </p>

<p> effect sizes and then averaged them. This procedure </p>

<p> yielded one effect size per study for each type of </p>

<p> measured outcome. In the one study that reported only </p>

<p> that a measured outcome was not statistically significant </p>

<p> and did not provide any further statistics, we assigned a </p>

<p> value of zero to that effect size. To calculate effect </p>

<p> sizes for reported drug use, we considered only alcohol, </p>

<p> tobacco, and marijuana use; we averaged effect sizes </p>

<p> across these substances. In a supplementary analysis, we </p>

<p> also considered use of these substances separately. Use </p>

<p> of other drugs, such as cocaine, was measured by some </p>

<p> studies, but the prevalence of use was too small to </p>

<p> produce meaningful effects. </p>

<p> The unweighted effect sizes at immediate posttest </p>

<p> for each outcome for each study are shown in Exhibit 7.3.=20 </p>

<p> Several of the effect sizes are .30 or higher, although </p>

<p> most are less than .20. The largest effect sizes are for </p>

<p> knowledge (that was only measured by three of the eight </p>

<p> studies) and social skills. The effect sizes for self- </p>

<p> esteem, attitudes about drug use, and attitude toward </p>

<p> police tend to be smaller. The smallest effect sizes are </p>

<p> for drug use, with none being greater than .11. The </p>

<p> higher effect sizes for knowledge compared with drug use </p>

<p> is consistent with other studies and supports the </p>

<p> conclusion that knowledge is easier to change than </p>

<p> behavior (Bangert-Drowns, 1988; Bruvold &amp; Rundall, 1988; </p>

<p> Tobler, 1986). </p>

<p> In addition to calculating one effect size for each </p>

<p> outcome for each study, we calculated the weighted mean </p>

<p> effect size and 95% confidence interval for each type of </p>

<p> outcome across the eight studies. The weighted mean </p>

<p> provides a summary measure across the eight studies that </p>

<p> is useful for indicating D.A.R.E.'s general effectiveness </p>

<p> with respect to each outcome. The weighted mean provides </p>

<p> a less biased estimate than the simple unweighted mean </p>

<p> because estimates from larger samples are given more </p>

<p> weight. It is computed by weighting each effect size by </p>

<p> the inverse of its variance, which is a reflection of the </p>

<p> sample size (Hedges &amp; Olkin, 1985). The effect size </p>

<p> estimates from larger studies are generally more precise </p>

<p> than those from smaller studies (Hedges &amp; Olkin, 1985). </p>

<p> The 95% confidence interval provides an upper and </p>

<p> lower bound for the estimate; in 95% of samples drawn, </p>

<p> the estimate would fall within these bounds. To </p>

<p> calculate the 95% confidence interval, 1.96 multiplied by </p>

<p> the square root of one divided by the sum of the study </p>

<p> weights is added to or subtracted from the mean (Hedges &amp;
</p>

<p> Olkin, 1985). </p>

<p> The weighted mean effect size at immediate posttest </p>

<p> and 95% confidence interval (CI) for each outcome are </p>

<p> depicted in Exhibit 7.4. The largest weighted mean </p>

<p> effect size is for knowledge about drugs (0.42), followed </p>

<p> by social skills (0.19), attitude toward police (0.13), </p>

<p> attitudes about drug use (0.11), self-esteem (0.06), and </p>

<p> drug use (0.06). The weighted mean effect sizes for </p>

<p> knowledge, social skills, attitude toward police, </p>

<p> attitudes about drug use, and self-esteem are </p>

<p> statistically significant. The statistical significance </p>

<p> of these D.A.R.E. effect sizes, however, should be </p>

<p> interpreted cautiously because the significance may be </p>

<p> positively influenced by the failure of most studies to </p>

<p> account for data Exhibit 7.4 Magnitude of D.A.R.E.'s Weighted
Mean </p>

<p> Effect Size (and 95% Confidence </p>

<p> Interval), by Outcome Measures at Imme- </p>

<p> diate Posttest </p>

<p> clustered by school. The confidence interval for the </p>

<p> weighted mean effect size for drug use overlaps with </p>

<p> zero, meaning than it is not significantly different from </p>

<p> zero. </p>

<p> Because averaging alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana </p>

<p> use for the drug use effect size could obscure </p>

<p> substantial differences among substances, we calculated </p>

<p> D.A.R.E.'s weighted mean effect sizes separately for </p>

<p> alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana use. None of the </p>

<p> individual effect sizes for any of the three substances </p>

<p> from any study is larger than 0.15. The mean immediate </p>

<p> effect size for alcohol use is 0.06 (95% CI: .00, .12); </p>

<p> for tobacco use, 0.08 (95% CI: .02, .14); and for </p>

<p> marijuana use, =FE0.01 (95% CI: =FE.09, .07). Only the mean </p>

<p> for tobacco use is statistically significant. =20 </p>

<p> The range of effect sizes, both individually by </p>

<p> study and averaged across studies, suggests that D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> has been more effective at immediate posttest in </p>

<p> influencing some outcomes than others. The core </p>

<p> curriculum has been most effective in increasing </p>

<p> knowledge about drug use and in enhancing social skills.=20 </p>

<p> Although some studies reported fairly large effect sizes </p>

<p> for attitudes about drugs and attitude toward police, </p>

<p> overall the studies show less D.A.R.E. success in </p>

<p> influencing these factors and self-esteem. Based on </p>

<p> these eight studies, the core curriculum has been least </p>

<p> effective at immediate posttest at influencing drug use </p>

<p> outcomes: alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana use. The </p>

<p> small effect sizes for drug use and attitudes about drugs </p>

<p> and police reflect, at least in part, the low levels of </p>

<p> drug use by this age group and their already negative </p>

<p> attitudes about drugs and positive attitude toward </p>

<p> police. </p>

<p> Comparison of D.A.R.E.'s Effectiveness to Other </p>

<p> Drug Use Prevention Programs for Youth </p>

<p> To see how D.A.R.E. compares with other school- </p>

<p> based drug use prevention programs, we compared the </p>

<p> weighted mean D.A.R.E. effect sizes with weighted mean </p>

<p> effect sizes computed for similar programs. For </p>

<p> comparison, we used the effect sizes reported in Tobler's </p>

<p> recent meta-analysis of school-based drug use prevention </p>

<p> programs (Tobler, in press, 1994). To allow the most </p>

<p> appropriate comparisons with D.A.R.E. effect sizes, we </p>

<p> obtained Tobler's results for only those programs, </p>

<p> excluding D.A.R.E., aimed at fifth and sixth graders.=20 </p>

<p> Although pupils in the comparison programs were in the </p>

<p> fifth and sixth grade, some sixth graders were in middle </p>

<p> school, whereas all D.A.R.E. sixth graders were in </p>

<p> elementary school. Like the D.A.R.E. studies, the </p>

<p> interventions analyzed by Tobler were implemented in </p>

<p> geographically diverse areas. Also similar to the </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. studies, demographic information was not </p>

<p> reported across all studies. The available data suggest </p>

<p> that the studies in Tobler's review represented both </p>

<p> white and minority populations and included urban, </p>

<p> suburban, and rural areas with urban areas predominating.=20 </p>

<p> These programs are a subset of 25 from the 114 programs </p>

<p> included in Tobler's meta-analysis. The studies from </p>

<p> Tobler's meta-analysis are referenced in Exhibit 7.5 and </p>

<p> listed in Appendix C. </p>

<p> We selected Tobler's meta-analysis for comparison </p>

<p> because it is more similar to our review than other meta- </p>

<p> analyses of drug use prevention programs (Bangert-Drowns, </p>

<p> 1988; Bruvold, 1993; Bruvold &amp; Rundall, 1988; Tobler, </p>

<p> 1986). Tobler's meta-analysis and ours used similar </p>

<p> processes and criteria to identify and select program </p>

<p> evaluations for examination and included both published </p>

<p> and unpublished studies. Like the D.A.R.E. criteria, </p>

<p> Tobler selected student-based quantitative evaluations </p>

<p> that included a control or comparison group and used a </p>

<p> pretest-posttest sign or posttest only with random </p>

<p> assignment. In addition, Tobler reported separate </p>

<p> weighted mean effect sizes for four categories of outcome </p>

<p> measures that are comparable to four of our outcome </p>

<p> measurements: knowledge, attitudes toward drugs, social </p>

<p> skills, and drug use. The meta-analyses differed, </p>

<p> however, in that Tobler excluded studies that did not </p>

<p> measure drug use and that included results from later </p>

<p> posttests. In addition, some of Tobler's programs </p>

<p> focused on a single drug rather than on multiple drugs as </p>

<p> in D.A.R.E. The collective impact of these Exhibit 7.5

<p> of these references. </p>

<p> differences should be minimal, however. Overall, the </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. and Tobler studies are highly comparable in </p>

<p> terms of program focus, study methodology, and target </p>

<p> audience. In assessing the magnitude of the effect sizes </p>

<p> reported for the Tobler studies, it should be noted that </p>

<p> the studies typically did not correct for the correlation </p>

<p> among students in the same school. As explained for the </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. studies, this may produce inflated effect sizes.=20 </p>

<p> Because neither the D.A.R.E. nor Tobler studies generally </p>

<p> made adjustments for this interdependence of </p>

<p> observations, the net effect on the comparison of effect </p>

<p> sizes should be minimal. </p>

<p> The evaluation studies included in Tobler's meta- </p>

<p> analysis are classified into two broad categories based </p>

<p> on typical combinations of program content and program </p>

<p> process (process describes the teaching approach, or how </p>

<p> the content is delivered): noninteractive (N=3D9) and </p>

<p> interactive programs (N=3D16). =20 </p>

<p> Noninteractive programs emphasize intrapersonal </p>

<p> factors and use more traditional teaching approaches.=20 </p>

<p> Activities typically are designed to increase knowledge </p>

<p> about drugs, boost self-esteem, promote self-awareness, </p>

<p> increase problem-solving skills, and promote values </p>

<p> clarifications. These activities, in turn, are expected </p>

<p> to encourage youth to make a personal decision to abstain </p>

<p> from using drugs. Program content is usually introduced </p>

<p> by the teacher in a didactic manner, and participatory </p>

<p> activities often involve teacher-led discussions. </p>

<p> Interactive programs emphasize interpersonal </p>

<p> factors and use a participatory teaching approach.=20 </p>

<p> Activities are designed to counter peer pressure to use </p>

<p> drugs through developing drug refusal skills, promoting </p>

<p> general social competencies, and correcting beliefs about </p>

<p> the prevalence of drug use among peers. Program process </p>

<p> emphasizes the interaction and exchange of ideas among </p>

<p> peers, and it encourages active participation of all </p>

<p> students in the classroom, particularly in small groups. </p>

<p> Consistent with other meta-analyses showing that </p>

<p> programs emphasizing social skills tend to be the most </p>

<p> effective at achieving their outcomes (Bangert-Drowns, </p>

<p> 1988; Bruvold, 1993; Bruvold &amp; Rundall, 1988; Tobler, </p>

<p> 1986), Tobler's interactive programs produced larger </p>

<p> effect sizes in all four outcome measures than </p>

<p> noninteractive programs. Because D.A.R.E. has features </p>

<p> of both noninteractive and interactive programs, we </p>

<p> compared D.A.R.E. with both categories of programs.=20 </p>

<p> The weighted mean effect sizes and 95% confidence </p>

<p> intervals by outcome for the D.A.R.E. studies and the two </p>

<p> types of comparison programs are shown in Exhibit 7.6.=20 </p>

<p> To test whether the mean effect sizes differed </p>

<p> significantly between D.A.R.E. and the noninteractive </p>

<p> programs and between D.A.R.E. and the interactive </p>

<p> programs, we also calculated the 95% confidence interval </p>

<p> around the difference between the means. If the </p>

<p> confidence interval spans zero, this indicates that the </p>

<p> difference between the two effect size means is not </p>

<p> statistically significant. Conversely, if the confidence </p>

<p> interval does not include zero, then the means are </p>

<p> determined to be significantly different; that is, the </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. mean is significantly greater or less than the </p>

<p> mean for the comparison programs. The difference between </p>

<p> the weighted mean effect sizes for D.A.R.E. and both </p>

<p> A comparison of D.A.R.E. effect sizes with effect </p>

<p> sizes of noninteractive and interactive drug use </p>

<p> prevention programs for fifth and sixth graders reviewed </p>

<p> by Tobler suggests that D.A.R.E. has been more effective </p>

<p> in influencing knowledge, attitudes, and skills outcomes </p>

<p> than noninteractive programs, although only the knowledge </p>

<p> difference is statistically significant. D.A.R.E. has </p>

<p> been less effective, however, than interactive programs </p>

<p> across all outcome measures, most prominently for social </p>

<p> skills and drug use. The only difference in effect size </p>

<p> means between D.A.R.E. and interactive programs that was </p>

<p> not statistically significant was for knowledge. For </p>

<p> drug use, the average effect size for interactive </p>

<p> programs was three times greater than the average </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. effect size; for social skills, four times </p>

<p> greater than D.A.R.E.; and for attitudes, three times </p>

<p> greater. These findings suggest that greater </p>

<p> effectiveness is possible with school-based drug use </p>

<p> prevention programs for fifth- and sixth-grade pupils </p>

<p> than is achieved by the original D.A.R.E. core </p>

<p> curriculum. </p>

<p> Methodological Considerations </p>

<p> Several methodological considerations relating to </p>

<p> the evaluations included in our review and to the </p>

<p> approach we used in conducting our review bear on the </p>

<p> interpretation of the results. </p>

<p> Fundamental considerations are whether the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> evaluations selected for review are methodologically </p>

<p> strong and are sufficient in number. As is appropriate </p>

<p> for meta-analysis, we used stated and objective criteria </p>

<p> to select D.A.R.E. evaluations for review. Because the </p>

<p> evaluations we selected had a comparison group, </p>

<p> administered both pretests and posttests, used </p>

<p> quantifiable outcome measures, and made statistical </p>

<p> adjustments for pretest differences on outcome measures, </p>

<p> we can be reasonably confident in their findings. </p>

<p> Eight evaluations were included in the review; this </p>

<p> is not a large number compared with the vast number of </p>

<p> sites where D.A.R.E. has been implemented. It far </p>

<p> exceeds, however, the number of evaluations of any other </p>

<p> widely available drug use prevention program. Most </p>

<p> prevention programs developed and evaluated by </p>

<p> researchers have been much less widely implemented, and </p>

<p> have received less scrutiny, than D.A.R.E. More </p>

<p> important, however, when considering the adequacy of the </p>

<p> number of studies, are the uniformity of D.A.R.E.'s </p>

<p> curriculum content and method of delivery across </p>

<p> implementation sites, and the consistent results found </p>

<p> across geographically heterogeneous studies. This </p>

<p> uniformity and consistency suggest that a sufficient </p>

<p> number of evaluations were identified for assessment of </p>

<p> the original core curriculum's immediate effects. Even </p>

<p> so, we would have preferred a full set of eight effect </p>

<p> sizes for each outcome. </p>

<p> The immediate effect sizes for the D.A.R.E. studies </p>

<p> may have been attenuated compared with the comparison </p>

<p> drug use prevention programs because the control groups </p>

<p> were not pure &quot;no treatment&quot; groups. As documented
by </p>

<p> Tobler (1986, in press, 1994), effect sizes are lower </p>

<p> when the control group receives some sort of drug </p>

<p> education. Information generally was lacking from the </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. evaluations on alternative interventions </p>

<p> received by the control groups, but it is likely that </p>

<p> most control groups received some drug education because </p>

<p> the studies occurred after the passage of the 1986 DFSCA.=20 </p>

<p> However, approximately half (54%) of the comparison </p>

<p> programs used for Tobler's study also were conducted </p>

<p> between 1986 and 1990, suggesting that they also may </p>

<p> suffer from the same effect. Nevertheless, the lower </p>

<p> effect sizes of the D.A.R.E. programs compared with the </p>

<p> interactive programs in Tobler's study could be due in </p>

<p> part to the likelihood that the control groups for the </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. studies received a stronger intervention than </p>

<p> did the control groups in the studies reviewed by Tobler. </p>

<p> Most of the drug use prevention programs evaluated </p>

<p> by Tobler are smaller-scale university research-based </p>

<p> evaluation studies, while D.A.R.E. is a widely available </p>

<p> curriculum. In both cases, however, the interventions </p>

<p> were implemented by service providers and the evaluations </p>

<p> were conducted by researchers. Even so, the intensity of </p>

<p> efforts devoted to interventions conducted for evaluation </p>

<p> research may be greater, the implementation conditions </p>

<p> more optimal, and the possibility for scrutiny and </p>

<p> control greater than would be the case for a program that </p>

<p> is widely disseminated. Some diminished effectiveness </p>

<p> may be inevitable once programs are implemented under </p>

<p> real-world conditions. This could be an important factor </p>

<p> in explaining some of the differences in effect sizes </p>

<p> between D.A.R.E. and the comparison programs. </p>

<p> Differences in the studies selected for our </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. review and selected by Tobler could also </p>

<p> contribute to the relative differences in effect sizes </p>

<p> between these programs. The differences include the </p>

<p> exclusion of studies by Tobler that did not evaluate drug </p>

<p> use behavior and the inclusion of outcomes from later </p>

<p> posttests. In addition, some sixth graders in the </p>

<p> programs reviewed by Tobler were in middle rather than </p>

<p> elementary school, and some programs focused on a single </p>

<p> drug, such as tobacco, rather than multiple drugs as is </p>

<p> the case with D.A.R.E. It is possible that these </p>

<p> differences could decrease, increase, or not change the </p>

<p> relative differences in effect sizes. For example, </p>

<p> differences might have been less if programs focused on a </p>

<p> single substance were not included in Tobler's meta- </p>

<p> analysis. It is possible that single substance programs </p>

<p> have greater impact on use of that substance than generic </p>

<p> drug education programs, although study of this </p>

<p> possibility is limited and findings are mixed (Tobler, </p>

<p> 1994). On the other hand, differences might have been </p>

<p> greater had Tobler excluded results from posttests beyond </p>

<p> immediate follow-up because curriculum effects tend to </p>

<p> decay rather than increase with time (Ellickson, Bell, &amp; </p>

<p> McGuigan, 1993; Murray, Pirie, Luepker, &amp; Pallonen, </p>

<p> 1989). The limited number of programs precluded </p>

<p> assessment of these possibilities, as well as whether </p>

<p> program effects differ, and in what direction, for sixth </p>

<p> graders in elementary versus middle school. </p>

<p> Finally, it is possible that our results might have </p>

<p> differed if there had been sufficient numbers of D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> evaluations and studies in Tobler's analysis to analyze </p>

<p> effect sizes while controlling the effects of other </p>

<p> factors. In addition to the differences between the </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. and Tobler studies described above, it is </p>

<p> possible that other factors may have varied across the </p>

<p> intervention programs and associated evaluation studies </p>

<p> that contributed to the observed differences in effect </p>

<p> sizes. For example, substantial variation in </p>

<p> characteristics of the students (e.g., in </p>

<p> race/ethnicity), features of the interventions (e.g., </p>

<p> variations in program intensity), and features of the </p>

<p> research design (e.g., experimental versus quasi- </p>

<p> experimental design) could have contributed to the </p>

<p> differences in program effects. In other words, some of </p>

<p> the differences in effect sizes observed between the </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. studies and Tobler's studies could have been due </p>

<p> to other factors than the type of program.=20 </p>

<p> Unfortunately, these possibilities could not be tested </p>

<p> because of the small number of studies. Further testing </p>

<p> is warranted when larger samples of D.A.R.E. and </p>

<p> comparison studies are available. </p>

<p> Summary </p>

<p> From a pool of 18 quantitative D.A.R.E. evaluation </p>

<p> studies identified by this review, eight met specified </p>

<p> methodological criteria and were selected for further </p>

<p> review. Each of these eight evaluations had a control </p>

<p> group, administered both pretests and posttests, used </p>

<p> quantifiable outcome measures, and made statistical </p>

<p> adjustments for pretest differences on outcome measures.=20 </p>

<p> Effect sizes for these studies at immediate posttest, </p>

<p> both individually by study and averaged across studies, </p>

<p> showed that the original D.A.R.E. core curriculum had </p>

<p> strong and statistically significant effects on knowledge </p>

<p> about drugs. The curriculum also had a positive and </p>

<p> significant impact on social skills. The core curriculum </p>

<p> had smaller, although statistically significant, effects </p>

<p> on attitudes about drug use, attitude toward the police, </p>

<p> and self-esteem. The curriculum had limited immediate </p>

<p> effects on use of alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana.=20 </p>

<p> Although the effect on tobacco use was small, it was </p>

<p> statistically significant. </p>

<p> Weighted mean effect sizes were used to compare </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. with other school-based drug use prevention </p>

<p> programs targeted at same-age youth. The original </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. core curriculum compared favorably with </p>

<p> noninteractive drug use prevention programs, which </p>

<p> emphasize intrapersonal factors and use more traditional </p>

<p> teaching methods. The original core curriculum compared </p>

<p> less favorably, however, with interactive drug use </p>

<p> prevention programs. Interactive drug use prevention </p>

<p> programs, which emphasize interpersonal skills and an </p>

<p> interactive teaching style, have been shown to be the </p>

<p> most successful drug use prevention programs (Tobler, in </p>

<p> press, 1994). </p>

<p> Several methodological considerations should be </p>

<p> noted in interpreting the results of this review. These </p>

<p> include the number of methodologically rigorous D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> studies in our review; the purity of the control groups </p>

<p> in the D.A.R.E. evaluations compared with those in the </p>

<p> comparison programs; and the relative impacts of </p>

<p> commercial programs such as D.A.R.E. and smaller scale </p>

<p> research-based interventions; and the small number of </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. and comparison studies available for assessing </p>

<p> other potential explanations for differences in program </p>

<p> effectiveness. </p>

<p> The findings of the D.A.R.E. outcome assessment are </p>

<p> discussed fully in Chapter 8. </p>

<p> CHAPTER 8 </p>

<p> DISCUSSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS </p>

<p> In preceding chapters, we presented data acquired </p>

<p> from our implementation and outcome assessments of </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. Information about D.A.R.E.'s operations, </p>

<p> prevalence, and effectiveness was collected from a </p>

<p> variety of sources. Given the complex nature of the </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. organization, it is not surprising that the </p>

<p> findings are voluminous. Nor is it surprising that </p>

<p> although some findings attest to the strengths and </p>

<p> robustness of D.A.R.E., others indicate limitations.=20 </p>

<p> This final chapter presents a discussion of these </p>

<p> findings. In the course of this discussion, we highlight </p>

<p> the key findings and, where appropriate, make </p>

<p> recommendations for programmatic changes and additional </p>

<p> research. =20 </p>

<p> This chapter is organized into three sections.=20 </p>

<p> Highlights from the implementation assessment are </p>

<p> presented in the first section, followed by key findings </p>

<p> from the outcome assessment. To facilitate a review of </p>

<p> the study's many and sometimes disparate findings, our </p>

<p> discussion is organized by some of the questions that </p>

<p> guided these study components. In the final section, we </p>

<p> attempt to synthesize the most important findings and </p>

<p> present overall conclusions derived from the study. </p>

<p> Implementation Assessment </p>

<p> As discussed in Chapter 1, we conducted an </p>

<p> implementation assessment of D.A.R.E. that had two </p>

<p> primary objectives. These were, first, to conduct an </p>

<p> assessment of the organizational structure and operation </p>

<p> of representative D.A.R.E. programs nationwide to learn </p>

<p> what factors contribute to the effective implementation </p>

<p> of D.A.R.E. programs nationwide and, second, to determine </p>

<p> how D.A.R.E. is tailored to meet the needs of specific </p>

<p> populations. </p>

<p> To address these issues, we collected data from </p>

<p> sources at all levels of the multi-layered D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> institution. We presented information concerning </p>

<p> operations at the national and regional level of D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> in Chapter 3, State-level operations in Chapter 4, and </p>

<p> local-level operations in Chapters 5 and 6. We obtained </p>

<p> information from interviews with Glenn Levant of D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> America and with coordinators and/or educational advisors </p>

<p> from each of the five Regional Training Centers (RTCs), a </p>

<p> review of available BJA documents, a survey of the State </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. coordinators, a survey of a nationally </p>

<p> representative sample of school district drug prevention </p>

<p> coordinators, and site visits to four purposively </p>

<p> selected schools (two with D.A.R.E. and two without). </p>

<p> How extensively is D.A.R.E. implemented nationwide, and </p>

<p> how does D.A.R.E.'s </p>

<p> prevalence compare with that of other curricula? </p>

<p> One of the most important findings of this study </p>

<p> was the extraordinary prevalence of D.A.R.E. In the </p>

<p> 1991-1992 school year, 44 of the 50 States had State </p>

<p> coordinators fortheir D.A.R.E. programs. Based on our sample
of school </p>

<p> districts, we estimate that over half the districts in </p>

<p> the country implemented at least one of the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> curricula in one or more of their schools. In </p>

<p> comparison, the two other most prevalent prevention </p>

<p> programs, Quest and Here's Looking at You (HLY), were </p>

<p> used in at least one school in about 27% and 24% of the </p>

<p> districts, respectively. </p>

<p> Another important finding is that the demand for </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. over the next 5 years is going to increase </p>

<p> substantially. Over 40% of the districts with D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> planned to expand its use. Of those districts without </p>

<p> D.A.R.E., 21% expressed the intention to institute it, </p>

<p> and 20% reported that they were as yet undecided about </p>

<p> using D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> Slightly over half of all school districts </p>

<p> implemented D.A.R.E.'s core curriculum, which is targeted </p>

<p> at 5th- and 6th-grade pupils; around 17% implemented the </p>

<p> K-4 curriculum, 11% the junior high school curriculum, </p>

<p> and 3% the senior high curriculum. Around 12% of the </p>

<p> school districts used Quest at the elementary level, 22% </p>

<p> at the middle/junior high school level, and 3% at the </p>

<p> senior high school level. Around 22% of the school </p>

<p> districts used HLY at the elementary level, 14% at the </p>

<p> middle/junior high school level, and 9% at the senior </p>

<p> high level. =20 </p>

<p> Does the extent of D.A.R.E. implementation vary by </p>

<p> demographic </p>

<p> characteristics of school districts, such as geographic </p>

<p> region, urbanicity, SES, </p>

<p> and minority status? How does D.A.R.E. compare with </p>

<p> other curricula in this </p>

<p> regard? </p>

<p> The Midwest region had the highest percentage of </p>

<p> districts using D.A.R.E. (59.9%) , followed by the </p>

<p> Southeast (56.8%), East (55.8%), West (48.8%), and </p>

<p> Southwest (37.1%). Use of Quest was highest in the </p>

<p> Midwest region (35.8%) and use of HLY was highest in the </p>

<p> East (46.4%). Use of all three prevention programs was </p>

<p> lowest in the Southwest region. The lower rates of </p>

<p> program use in the Southwest can probably be largely </p>

<p> attributed to its rural nature, and thus the greater </p>

<p> difficulties in fielding D.A.R.E. officers to </p>

<p> geographically dispersed schools. </p>

<p> There were no statistically significant differences </p>

<p> in the use of D.A.R.E., Quest, or HLY by either the </p>

<p> minority status or SES of the school districts.=20 </p>

<p> Urban/suburban school districts were, however, </p>

<p> significantly more likely to use D.A.R.E. and HLY than </p>

<p> rural districts. Further, large districts were </p>

<p> significantly more likely than small districts to use </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. We suspect that these findings may be </p>

<p> attributed to the relatively greater resources available </p>

<p> to urban and large law enforcement agencies. In the case </p>

<p> of D.A.R.E., these agencies may be at greater liberty to </p>

<p> free up their officers' time to teach D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> It is difficult to determine what adjustments might </p>

<p> make D.A.R.E. more accessible to rural and small school </p>

<p> districts. We believe that ways of improving access to </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. in rural and small districts should be examined.=20 </p>

<p> For example, methods for distributing DFSCA funds to </p>

<p> favor rural and small school districts instead of </p>

<p> distribution solely on a per capita basis could be </p>

<p> explored. =20 </p>

<p> How well integrated is D.A.R.E. with other drug use </p>

<p> prevention programs </p>

<p> offered in schools? </p>

<p> Neither D.A.R.E. nor any other drug prevention </p>

<p> program can or should stand alone in a school district; </p>

<p> instead, such programs should be integrated into a </p>

<p> comprehensive curriculum that is developmentally </p>

<p> appropriate and implemented at every grade level.=20 </p>

<p> Indeed, all school districts receiving DFSCA funds must </p>

<p> implement a comprehensive K-12 drug prevention program.=20 </p>

<p> Even were a school district to implement all four of </p>

<p> D.A.R.E.'s student curricula, additional drug prevention </p>

<p> programming would still be required in the grades to </p>

<p> which D.A.R.E. was not directed. Our survey showed that </p>

<p> only 2% of the school districts used only D.A.R.E. and no </p>

<p> other drug prevention program. Almost two-thirds of the </p>

<p> school district coordinators with D.A.R.E. reported that </p>

<p> the program was &quot;very well&quot; integrated with other </p>

<p> prevention programs. </p>

<p> How does D.A.R.E. compare with other alcohol and other </p>

<p> drug (AOD) programs </p>

<p> in terms of support and satisfaction for the programs? </p>

<p> The school district drug prevention coordinators </p>

<p> indicated that support for D.A.R.E. is very strong not </p>

<p> only among students and school staff=FEwhose support the </p>

<p> coordinators rated as very high=FEbut also among parents </p>

<p> and the community. These ratings were also markedly </p>

<p> higher than those for other AOD programs.=20 </p>

<p> The responses of the coordinators also indicated </p>

<p> the high regard in which the D.A.R.E. curricula are held.=20 </p>

<p> Two-thirds of the school district coordinators with </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. rated the curricula, as well as how it is </p>

<p> taught, as &quot;very satisfactory&quot;; over three-quarters
gave </p>

<p> the same rating to how students receive it. This </p>

<p> endorsement is all the more vivid when contrasted with </p>

<p> coordinators' ratings of other AOD prevention programs; </p>

<p> only one-third of coordinators with other AOD programs </p>

<p> rated these programs as highly. =20 </p>

<p> A close examination of these findings reveals that </p>

<p> coordinators in districts with a high percentage of </p>

<p> minority students were more likely to rate students' </p>

<p> receptivity to D.A.R.E. as very high than those in </p>

<p> districts serving predominantly white students. This </p>

<p> finding is not confounded by the district's urbanicity or </p>

<p> SES because comparisons between coordinators from these </p>

<p> pairs of districts (i.e., by high and low SES and by </p>

<p> rural and urban/surburban) were not statistically </p>

<p> significant. =20 </p>

<p> Of even greater importance are the satisfaction </p>

<p> ratings that the prevention coordinators gave to </p>

<p> D.A.R.E.'s effects on students. Almost two-thirds of the </p>

<p> coordinators with D.A.R.E. indicated that they were very </p>

<p> satisfied with D.A.R.E.'s effects; less than one-quarter </p>

<p> of those with other AOD programs reported that they were </p>

<p> very satisfied with the effects of these AOD programs.=20 </p>

<p> Are D.A.R.E. and other drug prevention programs adapted </p>

<p> to a community's </p>

<p> particular needs? </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. is distinguished by the integrity and </p>

<p> consistency with which its curricula are administered.=20 </p>

<p> During their training, D.A.R.E. officers are instructed </p>

<p> not to deviate in any substantive fashion from the </p>

<p> curriculum. The D.A.R.E. core curriculum allows only one </p>

<p> modification--a gang activity lesson that can be added in </p>

<p> schools where gangs are perceived to be a problem. </p>

<p> Over two-fifths of the coordinators with D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> and over half of the coordinators with other AOD programs </p>

<p> reported that the curriculum had been adapted at least to </p>

<p> some degree, however modest. The most frequently </p>

<p> mentioned reason for adaptation of both D.A.R.E. and </p>

<p> other AOD programs was drug availability at their </p>

<p> schools. Coordinators with D.A.R.E. provided some hints </p>

<p> as to the types of topics introduced, which included </p>

<p> discussing specific locally prevalent drugs, drug abuse </p>

<p> at home, and local drug arrests. During the site visit </p>

<p> to the urban school district, we learned that some police </p>

<p> officers incorporate their own street experiences into </p>

<p> their lessons. The second and third most frequently </p>

<p> mentioned reasons for adaptation for D.A.R.E. and other </p>

<p> AOD programs were student/community poverty and </p>

<p> racial/ethnic composition. </p>

<p> Although we recognize that some tailoring of </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. to the needs of a particular audience may be </p>

<p> appropriate, we encourage fidelity to the curricula and </p>

<p> careful monitoring of officer presentation. We strongly </p>

<p> suggest that current procedures of notifying the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> America RTC Advisory Board curriculum committee of </p>

<p> limitations in the curricula and of substantive </p>

<p> modifications of the curricula originating from that </p>

<p> agency be continued. Allowing officers to modify the </p>

<p> program at will would quickly result in disintegration of </p>

<p> the curriculum and the program. </p>

<p> To what extent are classroom teachers and other community </p>

<p> members or </p>

<p> agencies involved in D.A.R.E.? </p>

<p> The original core curriculum, which was in use when </p>

<p> the survey was conducted, encouraged classroom teachers </p>

<p> to remain in the classroom and to communicate D.A.R.E.'s </p>

<p> objectives to students. However, teachers played little </p>

<p> active part in the actual instruction. Teachers and </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. officers together teach the junior and senior </p>

<p> high curricula; at the senior high level, they are even </p>

<p> trained together. According to the drug prevention </p>

<p> coordinators, teachers in almost 90% of the districts </p>

<p> remained in the classroom during D.A.R.E. lessons, and in </p>

<p> 84% teachers were reported as &quot;actively involved&quot;
in </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. The revised core curriculum encourages </p>

<p> classroom teachers to take a more active role. </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. officers already are expected to meet for </p>

<p> an hour or so with the classroom teachers in a brief, </p>

<p> structured orientation and discussion. To the extent </p>

<p> that time and resources permit, we encourage the </p>

<p> co-training of teachers and officers at every curricular </p>

<p> level because we believe that such training would enhance </p>

<p> effective communication and coordination between the two.=20 </p>

<p> =20 </p>

<p> One of D.A.R.E.'s strengths is the active </p>

<p> involvement of individuals in D.A.R.E., both within and </p>

<p> outside of the school. Half of the prevention </p>

<p> coordinators reported that school staff, other than </p>

<p> classroom teachers, were actively involved in D.A.R.E., </p>

<p> and almost one-quarter reported that civic groups were </p>

<p> actively involved. This level of involvement surely </p>

<p> makes a major contribution to the high level of </p>

<p> enthusiasm that D.A.R.E. generates. We note that only a </p>

<p> relatively few coordinators reported that &quot;youth
groups&quot; </p>

<p> were involved in D.A.R.E. We recommend increasing the </p>

<p> involvement of both youth and church groups as a way to </p>

<p> reinforce D.A.R.E.'s message and to help establish </p>

<p> anti-drug use norms throughout the school and community.=20 </p>

<p> About half of the coordinators reported that </p>

<p> parents were actively involved in D.A.R.E. Our site </p>

<p> visits, however, suggested that parents tend to be rather </p>

<p> detached. D.A.R.E.'s efforts to reach out to parents </p>

<p> through the parent curriculum are commendable and, we </p>

<p> hope, will prove successful. Many such efforts in the </p>

<p> past have proved futile because the parents who are most </p>

<p> in need of educational intervention are also the most </p>

<p> difficult to reach and most resistant to attending </p>

<p> meetings. One additional method to involve parents more </p>

<p> directly in D.A.R.E. is to assign specific parent-child </p>

<p> homework exercises that, at the very least, will open </p>

<p> vital lines of communication between parent and child </p>

<p> concerning drug use. A second method that could </p>

<p> supplement the D.A.R.E. parent curriculum would be to </p>

<p> develop a freestanding, 1-hour video. This video could </p>

<p> be used to provide an introduction to D.A.R.E. and a </p>

<p> synopsis of the D.A.R.E. curriculum, as to well as </p>

<p> provide information about how to effectively reinforce </p>

<p> D.A.R.E.'s message. It might, for instance, include </p>

<p> advice about how to talk to youth about drugs and stress </p>

<p> the importance of serving as a model for a drug-free </p>

<p> life. We, thus, recommend that D.A.R.E. consider and </p>

<p> weigh the relative merits of a variety of strategies </p>

<p> designed to reach parents who may not respond to the </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. parent curriculum. </p>

<p> What role, if any, do D.A.R.E. officers have in treatment </p>

<p> referral for students </p>

<p> who already have substance abuse problems? </p>

<p> An additional role that D.A.R.E. officers can </p>

<p> undertake is to serve as members of student assistance </p>

<p> program (SAP) teams. Of the school districts that had </p>

<p> both SAPs and D.A.R.E., 37% had D.A.R.E. officers who had </p>

<p> been trained to participate in the district's SAP. Most </p>

<p> of the coordinators rated D.A.R.E. officers as highly as </p>

<p> they did guidance counselors (and much higher than </p>

<p> teachers) in effectiveness in implementing SAPs. We </p>

<p> recommend that D.A.R.E. officers become familiar with </p>

<p> SAPs in their schools and, when feasible, become involved </p>

<p> in these programs. We also recommend that the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> America RTC Advisory Board establish procedures for </p>

<p> officers to follow when their work with SAPs comes in </p>

<p> conflict with their duties as a police officer, so that </p>

<p> the confidentiality of youth and their parents who have </p>

<p> drug problems may be maintained. </p>

<p> How is D.A.R.E. managed at the national, regional, and </p>

<p> State level, and what </p>

<p> are the major responsibilities of the governing bodies? </p>

<p> At the national level, all D.A.R.E. operations are </p>

<p> overseen by D.A.R.E. America, a nonprofit organization </p>

<p> that bears ultimate responsibility for promoting, </p>

<p> monitoring, and overseeing the program. In this </p>

<p> capacity, D.A.R.E. America is assisted by a number of </p>

<p> regional and State organizations. These include five </p>

<p> RTCs that constitute the D.A.R.E. America RTC Advisory </p>

<p> Board and make recommendations to D.A.R.E. America </p>

<p> concerning the accreditation of State-level training </p>

<p> centers and monitor the fidelity with which the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> curriculum is taught at the local level. Educational </p>

<p> specialists representing the RTCs, together with staff </p>

<p> from the Los Angeles United School District (LAUSD) and </p>

<p> assisted by a Scientific Advisory Committee, also make </p>

<p> recommendations to D.A.R.E. America concerning </p>

<p> modifications to the various D.A.R.E. curricula. </p>

<p> State-level D.A.R.E. entities include chartered </p>

<p> nonprofit D.A.R.E. organizations designed to support the </p>

<p> program in that State; such organizations currently exist </p>

<p> in over one-third of the States, and it is expected that </p>

<p> they will be chartered in all 50. In those States that </p>

<p> currently lack such an organization, there is typically a </p>

<p> State employee designated as a D.A.R.E. coordinator. In </p>

<p> addition, 42 States currently have developed State </p>

<p> Training Centers (STCs), the purpose of which is to </p>

<p> conduct training for prospective D.A.R.E. officers. </p>

<p> Updating and improving curricular materials and </p>

<p> teaching strategies is a difficult task. We commend </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. America for convening a Scientific Advisory </p>

<p> Committee, and for choosing Dr. Kleber as committee </p>

<p> chair. It is our understanding that the committee's </p>

<p> charge is an expansive one and includes reviewing current </p>

<p> and ongoing D.A.R.E. evaluations, and integrating </p>

<p> relevant findings from other evaluations of school-based </p>

<p> drug prevention programs. We recognize the constraints </p>

<p> that D.A.R.E. faces in updating the curricula, given the </p>

<p> considerable costs required to retrain D.A.R.E. officers </p>

<p> appropriately. Hence, it is probably not feasible to </p>

<p> make substantive changes to the curricula more frequently </p>

<p> than once every 5 years, at a minimum. </p>

<p> Another source of expertise that should be tapped </p>

<p> as input for curricular changes is the U.S. Department of </p>

<p> Education. Various D.A.R.E. materials encourage the </p>

<p> establishment of strong ties between D.A.R.E. and </p>

<p> education at both the State and local levels. At the </p>

<p> national level, an educational consultant from each of </p>

<p> the five RTCs make suggestions concerning the curricula.=20 </p>

<p> However, it is our understanding that this group lacks </p>

<p> representation from a national-level education agency.=20 </p>

<p> We thus recommend thatthe D.A.R.E. America request an
appropriate member of= </p>

<p> the </p>

<p> U.S. Department of Education to serve as an ex officio </p>

<p> member, who should represent the department's extensive </p>

<p> drug prevention program. Such an individual would be </p>

<p> able to provide D.A.R.E. America with guidance as to how </p>

<p> effectively to integrate D.A.R.E. into the Department of </p>

<p> Education's comprehensive, K-12 drug prevention strategy.=20 </p>

<p> Furthermore, the inclusion of a U.S. Department of </p>

<p> Education staff member seems particularly appropriate as </p>

<p> long as D.A.R.E. continues to be mentioned as a specific </p>

<p> line item on the DFSCA budget. =20 </p>

<p> State coordinators informed us that over one-third </p>

<p> of the States had policy advisory boards (PABs), a </p>

<p> proportion that may have increased in the 2 years since </p>

<p> our survey. Because PABs can be instrumental in </p>

<p> developing and maintaining communications and positive </p>

<p> relationships among the various agencies involved in </p>

<p> D.A.R.E., we recommend that all States establish such </p>

<p> boards. </p>

<p> The great majority of the PABs comprise </p>

<p> representatives of both State and local law enforcement </p>

<p> and education. Other key individuals from the community </p>

<p> who have a stake in the success of D.A.R.E. or who could </p>

<p> provide different and valuable perspectives on D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> were less well represented. These include parents, </p>

<p> members of community-based organizations, citizens-at- </p>

<p> large, members of associations of educators, and business </p>

<p> representatives. The latter could be particularly </p>

<p> helpful in securing resources for D.A.R.E. We thus </p>

<p> recommend that State-level PABs systematically examine </p>

<p> their representation and seek ways to reach out to new </p>

<p> and potentially useful constituencies by expanding their </p>

<p> membership. </p>

<p> Because of the unique partnership between D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> and education, it is critical that State-level D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> operations have strong ties to education at the State </p>

<p> level. Around one-third of the State D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> coordinators reported a great deal of communication with </p>

<p> the State Department of Education, and another 50% </p>

<p> reported having at least some communication. We also </p>

<p> note that one State D.A.R.E. coordinator was affiliated </p>

<p> with a State Department of Education, and that three PABs </p>

<p> were chaired by staff members from State or local </p>

<p> education departments. The need to improve communication </p>

<p> with their State's education departments was mentioned by </p>

<p> several State D.A.R.E. coordinators. </p>

<p> One way to improve communication between D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> and education is for State D.A.R.E. programs to retain </p>

<p> educational consultants to act as liaisons. Two-thirds </p>

<p> of the State coordinators reported employing such a </p>

<p> consultant, and almost all of the States without </p>

<p> educational consultants considered acquiring a full-time </p>

<p> educational consultant to be priority. We recommend that </p>

<p> all State D.A.R.E. programs secure educational </p>

<p> consultants. </p>

<p> In a few States, the State D.A.R.E. programs </p>

<p> employed their own educational consultants. In most </p>

<p> States, however, educational consultants were employed by </p>

<p> education departments. We believe the liaison between </p>

<p> law enforcement and education will be most effective if </p>

<p> the consultants are based in the State Departments of </p>

<p> Education. Ideally, to ensure a maximum level of </p>

<p> coordination both with the State Departments of Education </p>

<p> as a whole and with their drug-free schools program in </p>

<p> particular, these consultants should be members of the </p>

<p> departments' alcohol and drug prevention offices.=20 </p>

<p> Certainly, regardless of whether the education </p>

<p> consultants are employed by education or directly by the </p>

<p> State D.A.R.E. program, they should seek all appropriate </p>

<p> means to establish meaningful affiliations with State- </p>

<p> level educational agencies. By the same token, education </p>

<p> agencies should be apprised of=FEand take seriously=FEtheir </p>

<p> responsibility to include D.A.R.E. representatives in </p>

<p> planning statewide drug prevention activities. To be </p>

<p> truly effective, education and law enforcement need to </p>

<p> work together in a partnership at the national and State </p>

<p> levels as well as at the local level. </p>

<p> Educational consultants' roles may vary, but </p>

<p> besides providing a &quot;bridge&quot; between the two </p>

<p> organizations, the consultants should help ensure that </p>

<p> D.A.R.E.'s multiple curricula fit into a comprehensive, </p>

<p> developmentally appropriate drug prevention program.=20 </p>

<p> Several coordinators mentioned that consultants could </p>

<p> assist with program evaluation and with monitoring </p>

<p> officer performance in the classroom. It may be </p>

<p> appropriate to consider expanding the roles of </p>

<p> educational consultants further, perhaps to provide </p>

<p> assistance in these areas. =20 </p>

<p> How is D.A.R.E. managed at the local level? </p>

<p> At the local level, the majority of the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> programs were managed by a single law enforcement agency, </p>

<p> primarily the sheriff's or city/town police department.=20 </p>

<p> Officer selection and classroom activities was most </p>

<p> frequently mentioned as the responsibility of the police </p>

<p> department, selection of D.A.R.E. classrooms was the </p>

<p> responsibility of the school administration and staff, </p>

<p> and responsibility for selection of D.A.R.E. schools was </p>

<p> shared by the police department, school administration </p>

<p> and staff, and the school superintendent.=20 </p>

<p> In a number of places throughout this report, we </p>

<p> have mentioned that D.A.R.E. is a collaborative venture </p>

<p> between a local school district and a law enforcement </p>

<p> agency, and we have emphasized the importance of </p>

<p> developing a positive relationship between the two from </p>

<p> the outset. One way to foster this relationship at the </p>

<p> local level is with written agreements that clearly state </p>

<p> the roles and responsibilities of each. Less than half </p>

<p> of the drug prevention coordinators mentioned that their </p>

<p> districts had such an agreement. We recognize that some </p>

<p> of the coordinators responding to our survey may simply </p>

<p> not have known that a written agreement existed, </p>

<p> particularly if they were new in their position and the </p>

<p> agreement had been written before they were employed. We </p>

<p> recommend that the law enforcement agencies without such </p>

<p> agreements secure them. Furthermore, we recommend that </p>

<p> the agreements be reviewed with school administration/ </p>

<p> staff at least every other year. This biennial review </p>

<p> would ensure that all parties are aware of their </p>

<p> responsibilities and could also serve as forums to </p>

<p> discuss issues relating to D.A.R.E.'s implementation and </p>

<p> to develop additional ways in which the D.A.R.E. officer </p>

<p> can serve the schools. They could also provide </p>

<p> opportunities for the school district to recognize the </p>

<p> officer's contribution. </p>

<p> Another way to engender a positive collaboration </p>

<p> between law enforcement and education is by developing </p>

<p> close liaisons between the D.A.R.E. officer and classroom </p>

<p> teacher. Such liaisons have obvious benefits, including </p>

<p> providing a role model for new officers, sharing the </p>

<p> burden of difficult classes or difficult students, and </p>

<p> increasing the likelihood that the teacher will reinforce </p>

<p> the D.A.R.E. message in other areas of instruction. We </p>

<p> learned from the drug prevention coordinators' survey </p>

<p> that classroom teachers in almost three-quarters of the </p>

<p> school districts with D.A.R.E. now integrate the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> message into their other activities in the classroom, so </p>

<p> that the program has a strong foundation in this area on </p>

<p> which to build. We thus recommend that D.A.R.E. officers </p>

<p> spend more time consulting with classroom teachers, both </p>

<p> formally at the beginning of the semester and informally </p>

<p> as the semester progresses. Topics for conversation </p>

<p> should include both the content of the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> curriculum and how teachers can effectively articulate an </p>

<p> anti-drug message. </p>

<p> What funding mechanisms are at the national/regional, </p>

<p> State, and local levels? </p>

<p> At the national/regional level, funding is received </p>

<p> primarily from BJA. The RTC coordinators mentioned the </p>

<p> need to find permanent funding sources that will </p>

<p> supplement Federal support and make D.A.R.E. less </p>

<p> vulnerable to the vicissitudes of such funding. One </p>

<p> solution to this issue is to establish or strengthen </p>

<p> reliance on State or local support, particularly the </p>

<p> latter. =20 </p>

<p> The majority of State D.A.R.E. programs receive </p>

<p> funding from BJA grants; around one-fourth of the States </p>

<p> received funding from governors' grants, grants from </p>

<p> other State agencies, and legislative funds. Four States </p>

<p> reported that they received no funding for their State- </p>

<p> level operations, and around one-third mentioned that </p>

<p> maintaining and increasing their funding or locating new </p>

<p> funding sources were among the most significant issues </p>

<p> facing them. If they are to discharge multiple </p>

<p> responsibilities for developing and managing their </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. programs successfully, the States must have </p>

<p> sufficient support. We recommend that the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> America RTC Advisory Board explore further the various </p>

<p> sources of support used by the State programs, and how </p>

<p> these have been obtained, and then provide technical </p>

<p> assistance to those States that currently operate with </p>

<p> either no funding or whose funding is precariously low.=20 </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. America could perhaps play a role in assisting </p>

<p> the development and maintenance of the STCs by providing </p>

<p> modest grant programs to assist States. =20 </p>

<p> At the local level, the cost of assigning a police </p>

<p> officer to deliver D.A.R.E. is assumed by the local city </p>

<p> or county law enforcement agency, and thus, ultimately, </p>

<p> by the community. Only a small minority of prevention </p>

<p> coordinators (one in six) indicated that program costs </p>

<p> were a barrier to implementation. D.A.R.E. America </p>

<p> assumes the costs of program curriculum materials. The </p>

<p> coordinators also informed us that primary support for </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. came from law enforcement, but that DFSCA funds </p>

<p> also played a major role in supporting D.A.R.E., as did </p>

<p> (to a lesser extent) school district funds. We note that </p>

<p> non-D.A.R.E. drug prevention programs appear much more </p>

<p> dependent on DFSCA funds than does D.A.R.E. Given </p>

<p> projected cuts in the DFSCA budget, which we understand </p>

<p> may amount to as much as 25% in the near future, </p>

<p> D.A.R.E.'s relative lack of reliance on DFSCA funds will </p>

<p> prove beneficial. We also note that D.A.R.E. is </p>

<p> relatively less dependent on local funds than are non- </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. programs, which also decreases D.A.R.E.'s </p>

<p> vulnerability to cuts as competing demands increase ever </p>

<p> tighter budgets. </p>

<p> How adequately does D.A.R.E. training meet the needs of </p>

<p> an expanding and changing program? </p>

<p> As noted earlier, the core curriculum has recently </p>

<p> been revised, and the new version is currently being </p>

<p> implemented. Because of D.A.R.E.'s magnitude, curricular </p>

<p> changes are far-reaching and, thus, expensive and time- </p>

<p> consuming to implement. Therefore, modifications to any </p>

<p> of the D.A.R.E. curricula must necessarily be weighed </p>

<p> against the substantial costs associated with updating </p>

<p> and distributing material, as well as retraining D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> officers. Nevertheless, modifications to the curricula </p>

<p> will need to be made periodically if D.A.R.E. is to </p>

<p> remain on the &quot;cutting edge&quot; of drug prevention </p>

<p> programming.=20 </p>

<p> To reduce the burden on D.A.R.E. of keeping </p>

<p> officers up-to-date with modifications to the curriculum, </p>

<p> the RTCs should explore novel means to provide officers </p>

<p> with curriculum and teaching updates and to provide </p>

<p> formal in-service training on a periodic basis. One in- </p>

<p> service training method that should be considered is the </p>

<p> use of the Law Enforcement Television Network (LETN).=20 </p>

<p> Because a substantial and growing number of police and </p>

<p> sheriffs' departments are linked to this network, it </p>

<p> could be an effective and cost-efficient means of </p>

<p> providing high-quality in-service programming to D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> officers around the country. Ideally, such a system </p>

<p> should be interactive to allow for discussions between </p>

<p> officers and trainers. Another less costly and more </p>

<p> accessible method that could be explored is the use of </p>

<p> videotaped programs to explain and demonstrate changes to </p>

<p> curricula and teaching methods. Still another </p>

<p> alternative is to use an on-line computer billboard to </p>

<p> distribute the latest D.A.R.E. information. This method </p>

<p> could be made available at very low cost to all police </p>

<p> departments with computers and modems. We learned from </p>

<p> the January 1992 D.A.R.E. America RTC Advisory Board </p>

<p> minutes that such a system was being developed by </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. America and indeed may now be in place. </p>

<p> In-service training should clearly not be </p>

<p> restricted to teaching D.A.R.E. officers how to implement </p>

<p> modifications to existing curricula. Such training could </p>

<p> also serve to increase the competence of newly minted </p>

<p> officers over their first semester. Regardless of how </p>

<p> powerful and effective the initial 80-hour introduction </p>

<p> to D.A.R.E. is, D.A.R.E. officers are bound to forget </p>

<p> some of what they have been taught when, 3 months later, </p>

<p> they are teaching one of the final D.A.R.E. lessons for </p>

<p> the first time. One potentially useful device would be </p>

<p> to develop and distribute taped versions of an expert </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. officer delivering the curriculum to real </p>

<p> classrooms, which new officers could be encouraged to </p>

<p> review immediately prior to the first time they teach the </p>

<p> lesson. Such tapes could serve several purposes: to </p>

<p> reinforce the content of what should be taught, to model </p>

<p> how the lesson should be taught, and to teach classroom </p>

<p> management techniques. Each videotape might highlight </p>

<p> dealing with a special problem (e.g., how to generate a </p>

<p> discussion when students tend to be silent; how to draw </p>

<p> out a shy or largely silent child; and how to respond </p>

<p> when a child discloses drug use by a peer, friend, or </p>

<p> family member). Each of these tapes should be relatively </p>

<p> short (or they will not be viewed) but could be followed </p>

<p> by a summary of the key points the officer should keep in </p>

<p> mind in teaching the next lesson. The tapes would also </p>

<p> help ensure that a primary goal of D.A.R.E. be reached-- </p>

<p> that lessons be taught uniformly. </p>

<p> Another training issue confronting the RTCs is the </p>

<p> development and maintenance of STCs. As D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> continues to grow=FEand our study has demonstrated that </p>

<p> demand for D.A.R.E. shows no signs of abatement=FEthe RTCs </p>

<p> will become increasingly challenged to meet the training </p>

<p> and monitoring needs of their constituent States. The </p>

<p> development and maintenance of STCs is critical because </p>

<p> the RTCs cannot assume the multiple burdens of training, </p>

<p> mentoring, and monitoring D.A.R.E. officers, as well as </p>

<p> assisting local law enforcement in developing and </p>

<p> maintaining effective ties with school districts. RTC </p>

<p> coordinators indicated that training and monitoring </p>

<p> officers already strain the capacities of the RTCs. We </p>

<p> recommend that sufficient funding be appropriated to </p>

<p> establish and/or maintain an STC in every State. =20 </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. officers are not the only D.A.R.E. staff </p>

<p> in need of ongoing training and technical assistance; </p>

<p> several RTC coordinators indicated that many of the State </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. coordinators have a similar need. RTC </p>

<p> coordinators also indicated that State coordinators need </p>

<p> support in developing lines of communication and </p>

<p> authority with local-level law enforcement agencies and </p>

<p> school districts, many of which have been operating with </p>

<p> a fair degree of autonomy or have been used to dealing </p>

<p> directly with the RTCs. It might be helpful if the RTCs </p>

<p> brought together their constituent State coordinators at </p>

<p> least yearly to discover and discuss common needs and </p>

<p> concerns and provide technical assistance to the </p>

<p> coordinators as a group as appropriate. However, the </p>

<p> need will still exist for resources to support individual </p>

<p> consultation between the RTCs and their respective State </p>

<p> coordinators. </p>

<p> As we mentioned earlier, the demand for D.A.R.E. in </p>

<p> school districts that currently lack the program is </p>

<p> likely to be exacerbated by the lack of available </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. officers. Fully 60% of the school districts </p>

<p> indicated that they want either to begin or increase </p>

<p> their use of D.A.R.E. Some of the RTC staff indicated </p>

<p> training may not be able to keep up with the demand for </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. Almost 15% of the drug prevention coordinators </p>

<p> identified lack of sufficient officers as a barrier to </p>

<p> implementing D.A.R.E. This problem was illustrated in </p>

<p> the urban D.A.R.E. school district we visited, where lack </p>

<p> of available officers led to dissatisfaction on the part </p>

<p> of school officials as officers were moved from one </p>

<p> school to another to accommodate demand. Clearly, those </p>

<p> communities in which D.A.R.E. is a high priority but </p>

<p> which lack sufficient D.A.R.E. instructors should provide </p>

<p> greater support to their law enforcement agencies to </p>

<p> recruit and train additional officers. Further, the </p>

<p> surprisingly high prevalence of the relatively new junior </p>

<p> and high school D.A.R.E. curricula suggests that each </p>

<p> community should examine the extent of the perceived need </p>

<p> for each D.A.R.E. curriculum and develop a long-range </p>

<p> plan to identify and fund additional officers as </p>

<p> necessary. </p>

<p> Any substantive curricular changes affecting what, </p>

<p> and especially how, D.A.R.E. officers teach, should be </p>

<p> accompanied by a determined effort to ensure that these </p>

<p> changes are fully reflected in officer behavior in the </p>

<p> classroom. The RTC coordinators clearly stressed the </p>

<p> need for increasing officer monitoring in the field as </p>

<p> well. Monitoring officers, however, is only part of the </p>

<p> task. Adequate resources should also be made available </p>

<p> to allow mentors to work closely with officers whose </p>

<p> performance needs improvement. </p>

<p> Outcome Assessment </p>

<p> The D.A.R.E. outcome assessment, described in </p>

<p> Chapter 7, had four primary objectives. These were </p>

<p> (a) to identify prior studies of D.A.R.E.'s effectiveness </p>

<p> as a drug use prevention program, (b) to assess the </p>

<p> quality and adequacy of the methodologies of these </p>

<p> studies, (c) to summarize D.A.R.E.'s effectiveness based </p>

<p> on this research, and (d) to compare D.A.R.E.'s </p>

<p> effectiveness with that of other school-based drug use </p>

<p> prevention programs. </p>

<p> We focused our assessment on the original D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> core curriculum, which is the heart of the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> program. We did not include the junior high school, </p>

<p> senior high school, and other D.A.R.E. curricula in the </p>

<p> outcome assessment because they are more recent, not as </p>

<p> prevalent, and generally have yet to be evaluated.=20 </p>

<p> Future evaluation efforts should focus on these </p>

<p> curricula, as well as on the revised core curriculum </p>

<p> implemented in September 1994. </p>

<p> Questions that guided the outcome assessment are </p>

<p> discussed in this section. </p>

<p> What were the scope, reliability, and technical quality </p>

<p> of the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> assessments? </p>

<p> A number of States and smaller localities have been </p>

<p> actively involved in assessing the D.A.R.E. core </p>

<p> curriculum since 1983, when the program was initiated in </p>

<p> Los Angeles. By using multiple sources to identify </p>

<p> studies, we obtained reports of 18 outcome studies in </p>

<p> twelve States and one Canadian province. These studies </p>

<p> collected data from students concerning D.A.R.E.'s </p>

<p> effectiveness in influencing outcomes the curriculum </p>

<p> seeks to change. </p>

<p> We defined a set of methodological criteria to use </p>

<p> in assessing the quality and adequacy of the study </p>

<p> methodologies. The criteria, based on review of the </p>

<p> evaluation methodology literature, were (a) that the </p>

<p> study compared students who received D.A.R.E. to students </p>

<p> in a control or comparison group who did not receive </p>

<p> D.A.R.E.; (b) that outcomes of interest, such as drug </p>

<p> use, were measured both before D.A.R.E. was implemented </p>

<p> and after the program ended; (c) that measures of the </p>

<p> outcomes were constructed so as to ensure reasonable </p>

<p> certainty that they were measured accurately; and </p>

<p> (d) that in the absence of random assignment, the </p>

<p> analysis strategy adjusted for any initial differences on </p>

<p> outcome variables between D.A.R.E. and comparison </p>

<p> students. </p>

<p> Half of the 18 studies met these methodological </p>

<p> criteria; however, one study was not considered further </p>

<p> because the children were tested 1 year later rather than </p>

<p> immediately after the program. That 50% of the studies </p>

<p> were of this technical quality suggests that a high level </p>

<p> of effort has been invested in carefully evaluating </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. Because these studies avoid many of the </p>

<p> problems that commonly undermine evaluation studies, </p>

<p> reasonable confidence can be placed in their findings.=20 </p>

<p> Some of the studies exceeded our criteria, for example, </p>

<p> by randomly assigning D.A.R.E. to schools, by analyzing </p>

<p> attrition effects, by statistically adjusting differences </p>

<p> in students' background characteristics, or by using an </p>

<p> analysis strategy appropriate to the research design. We </p>

<p> recommend that these features be incorporated into future </p>

<p> studies. </p>

<p> In assessing the findings of the eight </p>

<p> methodologically rigorous D.A.R.E. studies, it should be </p>

<p> noted that the studies are not a national sample of </p>

<p> representatively selected sites. It is reassuring, </p>

<p> however, that the findings tended to be consistent across </p>

<p> studies, indicating that the conclusions they suggest </p>

<p> about the effectiveness of the D.A.R.E. core curriculum </p>

<p> are reliable. </p>

<p> What gaps in the D.A.R.E. assessments merit attention? </p>

<p> Our review of studies suggested several </p>

<p> methodological issues that should be addressed directly </p>

<p> and critically by future studies. These include the </p>

<p> complete and careful reporting of the research design and </p>

<p> results, contamination of the comparison group, the </p>

<p> appropriateness of the analysis strategy, and the control </p>

<p> and analysis of attrition. </p>

<p> Although most of the studies we reviewed documented </p>

<p> the research procedures and methods, some did not provide </p>

<p> sufficient detail. Thorough documentation is needed for </p>

<p> assessing and interpreting the results; information was </p>

<p> most often lacking in the description of the study </p>

<p> sample. In addition to the exact sample sizes of the </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. and comparison groups, sociodemographic </p>

<p> information such as whether recipients live in urban, </p>

<p> suburban, or rural areas, their racial/ethnic </p>

<p> composition, and their SES, should all be reported. This </p>

<p> information is needed for assessing the degree to which </p>

<p> study results may be generalized. It also can be used to </p>

<p> test whether D.A.R.E.'s effectiveness varies by </p>

<p> characteristics of the sample. For example, is D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> equally effective among inner-city, suburban, and rural </p>

<p> students and among white, African American, and Hispanic </p>

<p> students? Almost none of the studies we reviewed made </p>

<p> these sorts of assessments. Sociodemographic information </p>

<p> also is relevant when making comparisons between studies </p>

<p> (as we did between D.A.R.E. and other school-based drug </p>

<p> use prevention programs) in order to assess the </p>

<p> similarity of the recipients of programs being compared. </p>

<p> An issue related to the completeness of reporting </p>

<p> is the need for reports of research to be accessible to </p>

<p> all those interested in D.A.R.E., including sponsors, </p>

<p> educators, parents, police officers, other researchers, </p>

<p> and concerned citizens. Most of the studies we </p>

<p> identified were not reported in the published literature, </p>

<p> and therefore are not easily accessible. It is vitally </p>

<p> important that reports be made quickly and widely </p>

<p> available. As we have suggested earlier, we recommend </p>

<p> that a library of D.A.R.E. evaluation reports and </p>

<p> associated summaries of key findings be maintained by the </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. America RTC Advisory Board. The extensive </p>

<p> communication channels between local, state, and national </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. entities should facilitate the prompt </p>

<p> identification and dissemination of evaluation studies. </p>

<p> One of the most important methodological issues </p>

<p> raised by our review is the potential contamination of </p>

<p> the control group by exposure to D.A.R.E. or to other </p>

<p> drug use prevention programs. Although none of the </p>

<p> comparison groups in the methodologically rigorous </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. studies was exposed to D.A.R.E. between pretest </p>

<p> and immediate posttest, contamination was an issue for </p>

<p> some studies conducting longer-term evaluations. This </p>

<p> contributed to our inability to evaluate D.A.R.E.'s </p>

<p> effectiveness beyond immediate posttest. Ironically, </p>

<p> contamination is particularly problematic for D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> evaluations because of the rapid dissemination of the </p>

<p> program and because of the various curricula now </p>

<p> prevalent for students at different grade levels. It is </p>

<p> increasingly possible, for example, for a control group </p>

<p> not receiving the D.A.R.E. core curriculum to receive the </p>

<p> junior high school curriculum, effectively reducing its </p>

<p> utility as a control group. </p>

<p> A larger, but more subtle comparison group problem </p>

<p> is that the prevalence of school-based drug use </p>

<p> prevention programs in general makes it virtually </p>

<p> impossible to find a true &quot;no treatment&quot; control
group.=20 </p>

<p> Hence, when comparing D.A.R.E. to another drug education </p>

<p> program, effectiveness is determined on a comparative </p>

<p> rather than an absolute basis. For example, a finding of </p>

<p> little difference in effectiveness may indicate that both </p>

<p> programs are effective rather than that D.A.R.E. is of </p>

<p> limited effectiveness or both programs are ineffective.=20 </p>

<p> None of the studies we reviewed indicated whether the </p>

<p> control group received any drug use prevention </p>

<p> programming, much less provided information about it.=20 </p>

<p> Future studies should describe any prevention </p>

<p> interventions being delivered to the comparison group and </p>

<p> discuss the implications for the results. </p>

<p> An increasingly recognized methodological concern </p>

<p> in the evaluation of school-based interventions is the </p>

<p> importance of following an analysis strategy that is </p>

<p> appropriate to the study design (Moskowitz, 1993; Murray </p>

<p> &amp; Hannan, 1990). Only two of the methodologically </p>

<p> rigorous studies addressed this issue in the statistical </p>

<p> analyses. When D.A.R.E. is assigned by schools, which is </p>

<p> usually the case, or by classrooms rather than by </p>

<p> individuals, the analysis strategy must take into account </p>

<p> the correlations among students in the same school or </p>

<p> classroom. This requires performing analyses at the </p>

<p> aggregate level (e.g., through comparison of school or </p>

<p> classroom means) or by statistically correcting for </p>

<p> within-school or within-classroom correlations. Analyses </p>

<p> that do not account for the correlations among subjects </p>

<p> tend to underestimate the variability in outcomes across </p>

<p> schools and therefore overstate the statistical </p>

<p> significance of treatment effects (i.e., the difference </p>

<p> between the D.A.R.E. and control schools). Because </p>

<p> statistical significance is often used as an indicator of </p>

<p> effectiveness, this can artificially inflate the effects </p>

<p> and thus unfairly bias interpretation of the results. </p>

<p> Related to this issue is the need for sufficiently </p>

<p> large samples to provide adequate statistical power for </p>

<p> detecting significant differences between D.A.R.E. and </p>

<p> comparison groups. Most of the D.A.R.E. studies reviewed </p>

<p> had large numbers of students. However, because the </p>

<p> sample of interest, as described above, usually revolves </p>

<p> around schools as opposed to students, it is important </p>

<p> that sample size determinations in future studies be </p>

<p> based on analysis of the number of schools needed in </p>

<p> treatment and control conditions. </p>

<p> The final methodological issue raised by our review </p>

<p> of studies concerns the careful control and analysis of </p>

<p> study attrition. Attrition can affect both the external </p>

<p> and internal validity of the study. Attrition rates were </p>

<p> usually reported in the D.A.R.E. studies selected for </p>

<p> review. However, data on demographic and pretest </p>

<p> differences in drug use and other predictor measures </p>

<p> between those who remained in and those who dropped out </p>

<p> of the study were less frequently reported. Attrition </p>

<p> analyses can reveal whether subjects who were lost to </p>

<p> follow-up disproportionately represent drug users or </p>

<p> those at risk of drug use. When this is the case, it </p>

<p> compromises the external validity of the study by </p>

<p> limiting the population to which the study results may be </p>

<p> generalized. When differential attrition occurs by </p>

<p> experimental condition, for example, such that a larger </p>

<p> proportion of drug users is lost from the intervention </p>

<p> than the control group, the internal validity of the </p>

<p> study is undermined. That is, the extent to which either </p>

<p> positive or negative outcomes can be attributed to the </p>

<p> intervention is limited. </p>

<p> We recommend that all future D.A.R.E. evaluations </p>

<p> not only meet, but also exceed each of the methodological </p>

<p> criteria used for our review by addressing these </p>

<p> methodological issues. Specifically, in addition to </p>

<p> meeting the criteria used for this review, we recommend </p>

<p> that studies report sample demographics, draw a sample </p>

<p> with sufficient statistical power to detect differences </p>

<p> in outcomes, use an analysis strategy appropriate to the </p>

<p> way D.A.R.E. is assigned, minimize attrition, and analyze </p>

<p> differential attrition across treatment groups. In </p>

<p> addition, we strongly recommend the use of an </p>

<p> experimental research design, in which schools are </p>

<p> randomly assigned to either D.A.R.E. or control </p>

<p> conditions. It is probably insufficient to assign </p>

<p> classrooms at random within schools, because the </p>

<p> activities of D.A.R.E. officers outside the classroom may </p>

<p> affect (or &quot;contaminate&quot;) other classes. Although
there </p>

<p> frequently are difficulties inherent in using an </p>

<p> experimental design, results from experimental studies </p>

<p> always will be subject to fewer questions about validity </p>

<p> than those of quasi-experimental studies. A small set of </p>

<p> the D.A.R.E. evaluations studies we reviewed used an </p>

<p> experimental study design and incorporated other </p>

<p> methodological features into the design. This level of </p>

<p> rigor is needed if future D.A.R.E. evaluation research is </p>

<p> to contribute further to knowledge about D.A.R.E.'s </p>

<p> effectiveness. </p>

<p> What overall assessment of D.A.R.E. do the study findings </p>

<p> suggest? </p>

<p> As described in Chapter 7, we used meta-analytic </p>

<p> techniques to synthesize and assess the findings of eight </p>

<p> methodologically rigorous studies of the original </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. core curriculum. Our approach required </p>

<p> calculating individual study effect sizes for drug use </p>

<p> and other outcomes targeted by the core curriculum and </p>

<p> then averaging effect sizes across studies. Effect sizes </p>

<p> facilitate comparing and summarizing results across </p>

<p> studies because they transform the results of the </p>

<p> studies, which may have been derived from a wide variety </p>

<p> of statistical tests, to a common metric. Hence, in </p>

<p> terms of statistical output, the results of one study are </p>

<p> comparable with those of another study. Furthermore, </p>

<p> effect sizes are a more useful indicator of effectiveness </p>

<p> than comparing whether results are statistically </p>

<p> significant from one study to another. This is because </p>

<p> statistical significance can be influenced by such </p>

<p> factors as sample size and analysis strategy, making </p>

<p> comparisons problematic. </p>

<p> The magnitude of the effect sizes, when considered </p>

<p> both within each study and averaged across studies, </p>

<p> indicated that D.A.R.E. was most effective at immediate </p>

<p> posttest in increasing knowledge about drug use and in </p>

<p> enhancing social skills. The average effect sizes </p>

<p> reported for these outcomes were statistically </p>

<p> significant and larger than for other outcomes. It is </p>

<p> consistent with other meta-analyses for the largest </p>

<p> effect sizes to be associated with knowledge change, </p>

<p> supporting the general observation that knowledge is more </p>

<p> amenable to change than attitudes or behavior. Averaged </p>

<p> across studies, D.A.R.E. also had statistically </p>

<p> significant effects on attitudes about drugs, attitude </p>

<p> toward the police, and self-esteem. The effect sizes </p>

<p> were smaller, however, than for knowledge and social </p>

<p> skills, indicating fewer meaningful changes in these </p>

<p> areas. </p>

<p> The smallest immediate effect sizes were for drug </p>

<p> use (alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana separately and </p>

<p> averaged together), and except for tobacco use, none was </p>

<p> statistically significant. In interpreting the small </p>

<p> magnitude of D.A.R.E.'s effectiveness with respect to </p>

<p> drug use behavior, it is important to note that the </p>

<p> immediate effect sizes may reflect, at least in part, the </p>

<p> relatively low frequency of drug use by the elementary </p>

<p> school pupils targeted by the original core curriculum.=20 </p>

<p> The effect sizes probably also reflect the short time </p>

<p> interval from pretest to immediate posttest for behavior </p>

<p> change to occur. D.A.R.E. was more effective at </p>

<p> influencing factors believed to mediate drug use. It is </p>

<p> most noteworthy that D.A.R.E. had positive effects on </p>

<p> social skills because it is widely believed that children </p>

<p> with greater social competencies are more able to resist </p>

<p> social pressures to use drugs. Long-term impact of </p>

<p> D.A.R.E., therefore, may result from D.A.R.E.'s immediate </p>

<p> impact on social skills. As described earlier, few </p>

<p> longer-term longitudinal studies have been conducted, and </p>

<p> some have been compromised by contamination of the </p>

<p> control group. However, based on two experimental </p>

<p> studies for which reliable information 1 and 2 years </p>

<p> after implementation is available, there is no evidence </p>

<p> that D.A.R.E.'s effects are activated when subjects are </p>

<p> older (Clayton et al., 1991b; Ennett et al., 1994). Most </p>

<p> long-term evaluations of drug use prevention programs </p>

<p> have shown that curriculum effects decay rather than </p>

<p> appear or increase with time (Ellickson et al., 1993; </p>

<p> Murray et al., 1989). </p>

<p> Future D.A.R.E. evaluation studies should continue </p>

<p> to assess drug use, attitudes about drug use, social </p>

<p> skills, and attitude toward police. Drug use indicators </p>

<p> should include tobacco (cigarettes and smokeless </p>

<p> tobacco), alcohol (particularly beer, wine, and wine </p>

<p> coolers), and marijuana. In addition, use of inhalants </p>

<p> and any other drugs that are locally prevalent should be </p>

<p> monitored. It is also important to continue to measure </p>

<p> outcomes targeted by the D.A.R.E. curriculum, such as </p>

<p> social skills, that are believed to indirectly influence </p>

<p> drug use. This requires linking outcome measures to </p>

<p> specific objectives addressed by the various lessons of </p>

<p> the curriculum. These data are needed for measuring a </p>

<p> variety of potentially important program effects other </p>

<p> than drug use behavior, and for testing assumptions about </p>

<p> the means by which the D.A.R.E. curriculum influences </p>

<p> drug use.=20 </p>

<p> For maximal usefulness, we further recommend that </p>

<p> effect sizes be routinely reported with the study results </p>

<p> to facilitate comparison both to the results of this </p>

<p> meta-analysis and those of future studies. As </p>

<p> demonstrated by this meta-analysis, effect sizes can be </p>

<p> readily calculated from a variety of statistical tests, </p>

<p> so this should not place an undue burden on researchers. </p>

<p> When the results of future D.A.R.E. evaluation </p>

<p> studies become available, they should be carefully </p>

<p> studied and compared with the results of the studies </p>

<p> reviewed here. As we recommended earlier, the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> America RTC Advisory Board could coordinate periodic </p>

<p> reviews of the evaluations. It is likely that ongoing </p>

<p> review of evaluation results will suggest areas where the </p>

<p> curriculum might need modification. </p>

<p> How well does D.A.R.E. address drug involvement by youth </p>

<p> in general? </p>

<p> The effect sizes discussed above indicate the </p>

<p> extent to which the original D.A.R.E. core curriculum </p>

<p> influenced drug use by youth and other outcomes at </p>

<p> immediate posttest. To put the D.A.R.E. results in </p>

<p> context, we compared D.A.R.E.'s effectiveness with that </p>

<p> of other school-based drug use prevention programs to </p>

<p> determine whether D.A.R.E. had greater, smaller, or </p>

<p> similar effects. Hence, we compared the average D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> effect sizes for drug use, knowledge, attitudes, and </p>

<p> skills to average effect sizes calculated for other </p>

<p> methodologically strong school-based drug use prevention </p>

<p> programs. We restricted the comparison programs to those </p>

<p> for upper elementary school pupils to make the </p>

<p> comparisons most meaningful. </p>

<p> We compared D.A.R.E. to two broad categories of </p>

<p> prevention programs, namely &quot;interactive&quot; and </p>

<p> &quot;noninteractive&quot; programs (Tobler, in press,
1994).=20 </p>

<p> These two program categories cover most types of current </p>

<p> school-based prevention efforts described in Chapter 2.=20 </p>

<p> Interactive programs generally are the same as the social </p>

<p> competence programs described in that chapter. These </p>

<p> programs represent the most recent advances in drug use </p>

<p> prevention strategies, and emphasize social competencies </p>

<p> and interactive teaching methods. Noninteractive </p>

<p> programs generally include knowledge and affective </p>

<p> programs, also described in Chapter 2. These programs </p>

<p> represent earlier approaches to drug education that </p>

<p> emphasize changing knowledge and attitudes about drug use </p>

<p> through more traditional learning styles. Interestingly, </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. shares similarities with both noninteractive and </p>

<p> interactive programs. The original core curriculum was </p>

<p> developed when prevention efforts were in transition </p>

<p> between noninteractive programs (knowledge and affective </p>

<p> education programs) and the emergence of interactive </p>

<p> programs (these emphasizing social influence). </p>

<p> Average D.A.R.E. immediate effect sizes were </p>

<p> greater, except for drug use, than the comparable average </p>

<p> effect sizes for noninteractive programs. The D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> effect sizes were smaller, however, than the effect sizes </p>

<p> for interactive programs. For drug use, the average </p>

<p> effect size for interactive programs was three times </p>

<p> greater than the average D.A.R.E. effect size; for social </p>

<p> skills, four times greater than for D.A.R.E.; and for </p>

<p> attitudes, three times greater. </p>

<p> Interactive programs have been shown to be the most </p>

<p> promising drug use prevention programs; noninteractive </p>

<p> programs generally have been shown to be less effective </p>

<p> (Botvin, 1990; Bruvold, 1993; Bruvold &amp; Rundall, 1988; </p>

<p> Tobler, 1986, in press, 1994). Because D.A.R.E. shares </p>

<p> features of both interactive and noninteractive programs, </p>

<p> it is perhaps not surprising that the effect sizes we </p>

<p> reported should fall somewhere between. </p>

<p> In Chapter 7, we described several methodological </p>

<p> reasons that could help account for the differences in </p>

<p> effect sizes between the D.A.R.E. studies and the </p>

<p> interactive comparison programs. These included the </p>

<p> possibility that the control groups in the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> studies were exposed to some sort of alternative drug </p>

<p> education programs, whereas the control groups for the </p>

<p> various interactive studies were not. Another possibil- </p>

<p> ity is that because the interactive programs were </p>

<p> primarily university research-based evaluation studies, </p>

<p> the evaluations--and programs themselves--may have been </p>

<p> more stringently implemented and more closely monitored.=20 </p>

<p> Under these conditions, greater effectiveness might be </p>

<p> expected than in real-world conditions, such as those </p>

<p> surrounding D.A.R.E. Other possibilities include factors </p>

<p> that may have varied across the intervention programs and </p>

<p> associated evaluation studies that contributed to the </p>

<p> observed differences in effect sizes. For example, </p>

<p> substantial variation in characteristics of the studients </p>

<p> (e.g., in race/ethnicity), features of the interventions </p>

<p> (e.g., variations in program intensity), and features of </p>

<p> the research design (e.g., experimental versus quasi- </p>

<p> experimental design) could have contributed to </p>

<p> differences in program effects. Such possibilities could </p>

<p> not be tested because of the small number of studies.=20 </p>

<p> Further testing is warranted when larger samples of </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. and comparison studies are available. </p>

<p> It is also important to consider substantive </p>

<p> reasons that could account for the differences. Possible </p>

<p> explanations include the content of the original core </p>

<p> curriculum, the use of law enforcement officers as </p>

<p> instructors, and the more didactic approach of the </p>

<p> instruction. Consideration of each of these explanations </p>

<p> suggests areas for future research and possibly for </p>

<p> programmatic change. </p>

<p> As we have indicated, D.A.R.E.'s curriculum content </p>

<p> has similarities with both noninteractive and interactive </p>

<p> programs, although it has more of an intrapersonal focus </p>

<p> than most interactive programs and, conversely, more of a </p>

<p> skills focus than most noninteractive programs. Perhaps </p>

<p> greater emphasis in the D.A.R.E. core curriculum on </p>

<p> social influences, and less emphasis on affective </p>

<p> factors, might result in effect sizes nearer to those </p>

<p> reported from interactive programs. However, it is </p>

<p> difficult to speculate on the effect of altering the </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. curriculum by adding or subtracting particular </p>

<p> lessons. Most evaluations of school-based prevention </p>

<p> programs have assessed the effectiveness of overall </p>

<p> programs rather than of the various program components or </p>

<p> combinations of components. Future research in this area </p>

<p> might suggest particular curriculum changes. </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. instruction offers another possible area </p>

<p> of explanation for D.A.R.E.'s relatively poorer </p>

<p> performance compared with interactive programs. Although </p>

<p> instruction by police officers is the sine qua non of the </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. curriculum, their effectiveness may be less than </p>

<p> other possible program providers. For example, despite </p>

<p> the extensive D.A.R.E. training received by law </p>

<p> enforcement officers, they may not be as well equipped to </p>

<p> lead the curriculum as classroom teachers are. No </p>

<p> studies have been reported in which the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> curriculum was offered by anyone other than a police </p>

<p> officer; examination of the results from such a study </p>

<p> might suggest whether police officers are as effective as </p>

<p> other possible instructors. </p>

<p> Regardless of the leader, however, the generally </p>

<p> more traditional teaching style used by D.A.R.E. has not </p>

<p> been shown to be as effective as an interactive teaching </p>

<p> mode (Tobler, 1986, in press, 1994). Traditional </p>

<p> didactic approaches that involve teachers delivering </p>

<p> information, with little response from students, are </p>

<p> increasingly recognized as undesirable. More effective </p>

<p> are strategies that engage students in a dialogue with </p>

<p> the teacher; more effective still are cooperative or </p>

<p> participatory learning approaches in which the teacher </p>

<p> serves as a facilitator or catalyst to generate </p>

<p> discussions and other interactions among students.=20 </p>

<p> Although some D.A.R.E. activities encourage pupil </p>

<p> interaction, the original core curriculum relies heavily </p>

<p> on the officer as expert and makes frequent use of </p>

<p> lectures and question-answer sessions between the officer </p>

<p> and pupils. In fact, it is in teaching style, not </p>

<p> curriculum content, that D.A.R.E. differs most from the </p>

<p> interactive programs examined by Tobler. In the revised </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. core curriculum, there is greater emphasis on </p>

<p> such cooperative learning experiences. We recommend that </p>

<p> the D.A.R.E. training programs urge officers to employ </p>

<p> more interactive methods and provide specific guidance on </p>

<p> how they can do so. </p>

<p> What are the intended and unintended consequences of </p>

<p> D.A.R.E.'s approach to </p>

<p> drug abuse prevention? </p>

<p> None of the studies we reviewed examined </p>

<p> consequences of the D.A.R.E. program, either intended or </p>

<p> unintended, other than those related directly to the </p>

<p> curriculum. However, a number of consequences can be </p>

<p> envisioned. These include effects related to other </p>

<p> behaviors than drug use (e.g., effects on violent and </p>

<p> delinquent behavior). More likely, perhaps, may be </p>

<p> consequences related to the relationship that develops </p>

<p> between the D.A.R.E. officers and students, which may in </p>

<p> turn have positive consequences for police and community </p>

<p> relations in general. Research indicates that the </p>

<p> effects on police officers through their exposure to </p>

<p> students and the problems they face may also be </p>

<p> substantial and beneficial (D.A.R.E. Southeast Regional </p>

<p> Training Center, 1992). It is possible, in fact, that </p>

<p> some of D.A.R.E.'s most important effects are related to </p>

<p> the relations between students and police officers. The </p>

<p> studies we reviewed provided little insight into these </p>

<p> areas. This suggests the importance of research to </p>

<p> explore other consequences related to D.A.R.E.'s approach </p>

<p> to drug use prevention. </p>

<p> Conclusion </p>

<p> As might be expected of an institution as large as </p>

<p> D.A.R.E., our implementation and outcome assessments </p>

<p> present an array of findings and raise a number of issues </p>

<p> deserving of consideration by the D.A.R.E. organization </p>

<p> and all those concerned with this program. Perhaps most </p>

<p> prominently, the findings show a program that has been </p>

<p> extremely successful at placing drug education in our </p>

<p> Nation's schools. Indeed, D.A.R.E. is now implemented in </p>

<p> the majority of school districts in the country and is </p>

<p> expected to grow substantially in coming years. At the </p>

<p> same time, however, as our findings confirm D.A.R.E.'s </p>

<p> prevalence and popularity, they also suggest that the </p>

<p> original D.A.R.E. core curriculum has not been as </p>

<p> successful in accomplishing its mission to prevent drug </p>

<p> use among fifth and sixth graders as have interactive </p>

<p> programs. Review of the rigorous evaluations of the </p>

<p> original core curriculum, the heart of D.A.R.E., showed </p>

<p> that D.A.R.E. had only limited immediate effects on </p>

<p> students' drug use. Although the curriculum was more </p>

<p> successful in influencing other outcomes, such as social </p>

<p> skills, more work is needed to make D.A.R.E. more </p>

<p> effective as a drug use prevention program. </p>

<p> Given D.A.R.E.'s strengths, the task of increasing </p>

<p> the effectiveness of the core curriculum is feasible.=20 </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. has achieved its accomplishments to date through </p>

<p> building a complex and solid organizational structure </p>

<p> that reaches from local to national levels, by forging </p>

<p> close partnerships between education and law enforcement, </p>

<p> and by winning substantial community support for the </p>

<p> program. In no other program of this magnitude have </p>

<p> school districts welcomed into the classroom outsiders </p>

<p> who lack traditional educational credentials to replace </p>

<p> teachers as instructors of a major curriculum. These </p>

<p> resources, as well as the dedication of the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> officers in the classroom, should enable D.A.R.E. to move </p>

<p> forward more effectively to meet the challenges of drug </p>

<p> use prevention. In this final section of our assessment, </p>

<p> we briefly recapitulate our major findings and </p>

<p> recommendations. </p>

<p> =20 </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. 's prevalence. D.A.R.E. is now </p>

<p> implemented in over half the school districts in the </p>

<p> country and is expected to grow substantially in the </p>

<p> coming years. Because it is least prevalent in small and </p>

<p> rural school districts, we believe that ways for these </p>

<p> school districts to increase access to D.A.R.E. should be </p>

<p> examined. </p>

<p> =20 </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. 's organization. D.A.R.E. is at once </p>

<p> both hierarchical and community-based. Although it is </p>

<p> carefully controlled, monitored, and overseen at the </p>

<p> national, regional, and State levels, it is also very </p>

<p> much a grass-roots movement, dependent on local </p>

<p> initiatives to form partnerships and secure support. At </p>

<p> the State level and above, we suggest that sufficient </p>

<p> resources be made available to support this burgeoning </p>

<p> organization to ensure adequate authority, communication, </p>

<p> technical assistance, and oversight. At the local level, </p>

<p> we believe that alternative sources of support should be </p>

<p> explored so that D.A.R.E. can be freed as much as </p>

<p> possible from dependence on public funds. =20 </p>

<p> =20 </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. 's partnership with education. Law </p>

<p> enforcement's relationship with education is the </p>

<p> cornerstone of D.A.R.E. We believe that at all levels a </p>

<p> variety of mechanisms could be instituted to strengthen </p>

<p> this critical partnership. This includes improving </p>

<p> methods for co-teaching D.A.R.E. at the local level, as </p>

<p> well as increasing where possible the already </p>

<p> multifaceted involvement of D.A.R.E. officers in school </p>

<p> life. We also suggest ensuring adequate representation </p>

<p> on advisory boards by staff of departments of education </p>

<p> at the State and national levels. </p>

<p> =20 </p>

<p> Popular support for D.A.R.E. Anecdotal evidence </p>

<p> of grass-roots support for D.A.R.E. is abundant and is </p>

<p> fully confirmed in our study. School-based drug </p>

<p> prevention coordinators tended to rate school staff's </p>

<p> attitudes toward D.A.R.E. as well as those of students, </p>

<p> the parents, and the community as very supportive. The </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. curriculum and students' receptivity to the </p>

<p> program, and perhaps most important, D.A.R.E.'s effects </p>

<p> on students were rated as very satisfactory. This </p>

<p> persuasive evidence suggests that whatever modifications </p>

<p> and enhancements may be made to the D.A.R.E. curriculum </p>

<p> and how the program is taught, D.A.R.E.'s organization </p>

<p> and structure at the local level is sound and should be </p>

<p> preserved. </p>

<p> =20 </p>

<p> The original D.A.R.E. core curricula. Drug </p>

<p> prevention coordinators' endorsements of D.A.R.E.'s </p>

<p> positive effects on students are generally not supported </p>

<p> by the results of the methodologically sound short-term </p>

<p> evaluations of the original D.A.R.E. core curriculum we </p>

<p> summarized. As indicated earlier, D.A.R.E. demonstrated </p>

<p> somewhat greater effects than those of didactic </p>

<p> school-based drug prevention methods that are based on </p>

<p> affective approaches, but considerably fewer effects than </p>

<p> those of interactive methods that use social influence </p>

<p> approaches. </p>

<p> Because D.A.R.E. already incorporates many </p>

<p> interactive features, we believe that appropriate </p>

<p> modifications can be made both to the core curriculum and </p>

<p> to the way D.A.R.E. is taught that are well within the </p>

<p> context of the institution as a whole. These </p>

<p> modifications should be made periodically (perhaps every </p>

<p> 2 years), as refinements are suggested by evaluations of </p>

<p> drug prevention programs in general, and of D.A.R.E.
inparticular. We comm= </p>

<p> end </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. for convening a </p>

<p> Scientific Advisory Committee that comprises drug </p>

<p> prevention specialists who will review relevant drug </p>

<p> prevention research findings and make recommendations </p>

<p> concerning improvements to the curricula.=20 </p>

<p> In conclusion, D.A.R.E. represents an institution </p>

<p> that is unique in the area of drug use prevention: a </p>

<p> partnership between law enforcement and education that </p>

<p> has the substantial support of children, parents, and the </p>

<p> community at large. Not unexpectedly, along with this </p>

<p> highly visible profile come high expectations. Our </p>

<p> report demonstrates D.A.R.E.'s success in meeting many of </p>

<p> these expectations, as well as challenges that lie ahead.=20 </p>

<p> Key to the continued growth of D.A.R.E. will be careful </p>

<p> monitoring of the effectiveness of the various curricula, </p>

<p> coupled with the willingness to make and assess </p>

<p> modifications that could enhance effectiveness. D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> has already demonstrated its responsiveness to change by </p>

<p> the introduction of new curricula, revisions to the core </p>

<p> curriculum, and expanded roles for D.A.R.E. officers.=20 </p>

<p> Equally important to D.A.R.E.'s viability will be its </p>

<p> continued coordination of the roles and responsibilities </p>

<p> of the many D.A.R.E. players. In both of these efforts, </p>

<p> we recommend that D.A.R.E. seek to strengthen its </p>

<p> partnerships with individuals and institutions outside </p>

<p> its bounds. The advice, support, and perspectives of </p>

<p> those who are not part of the D.A.R.E. structure but who </p>

<p> are equally committed to drug use prevention will enhance </p>

<p> the vitality and integrity of the program. We believe </p>

<p> these efforts will result in a program that maintains its </p>

<p> unique identity and place in drug education, while </p>

<p> meeting more effectively the challenge of reducing drug </p>

<p> use among youth. </p>

<p> Individual Study Descriptions </p>

<p> Brief descriptions of the eight methodologically rigorous
studies </p>

<p> selected for the meta-analysis are given below in </p>

<p> alphabetical order by the location of the study. The </p>

<p> research design, sample size and characteristics, and </p>

<p> results for drug use knowledge, attitudes about drug use, </p>

<p> social skills, self-esteem, attitude toward police, and </p>

<p> drug use behavior are reported. Additional information </p>

<p> and greater detail about the study methodologies and </p>

<p> results are available in the reports or papers issued by </p>

<p> each study. </p>

<p> 1.British Columbia </p>

<p> The British Columbia evaluation of D.A.R.E. (Walker, 1990)
used a </p>

<p> quasi-experimental design in which seven schools were </p>

<p> assigned to receive D.A.R.E. and four schools with </p>

<p> similar demographic characteristics were selected for the </p>

<p> comparison condition. The study administered an </p>

<p> anonymous pretest and immediate posttest; assessed </p>

<p> pretest equivalence on some demographic variables and all </p>

<p> outcome variables; and controlled for pretest values on </p>

<p> outcome variables by analyzing change scores at the </p>

<p> aggregate level. The sample included 463 fifth-, sixth-, </p>

<p> and seventh-grade pupils. No information was given on </p>

<p> the ethnic composition of the sample. </p>

<p> The results showed that D.A.R.E. had a statistically
significant </p>

<p> effect on subjects' knowledge about drugs. D.A.R.E. did </p>

<p> not have a statistically significant effect on attitudes </p>

<p> about drug use or on drug use behavior (use of tobacco, </p>

<p> beer, pop, marijuana, acid, valium, wine, aspirin, </p>

<p> uppers, downers, heroin, crack, liquor, candy, glue, and </p>

<p> PCP). </p>

<p> 2. Hawaii </p>

<p> The Hawaii evaluation of D.A.R.E. (Manos, Kameoka, &amp;
Tanji, 1986) </p>

<p> used a quasi-experimental research design in which 23 </p>

<p> schools were assigned to either D.A.R.E. or comparison </p>

<p> conditions. In three other schools, some classrooms were </p>

<p> assigned to D.A.R.E. and other classrooms to the </p>

<p> comparison condition; data from these comparison </p>

<p> classrooms were not included in our analysis. The study </p>

<p> administered a pretest and immediate posttest; matched </p>

<p> subjects from pretest to posttest; used some measures </p>

<p> that were standardized scales or derived from existing </p>

<p> measures; and controlled for pretest values on outcome </p>

<p> variables. The sample included 2,009 fifth-grade pupils </p>

<p> (not including the pupils in comparison classrooms in the </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. schools). No information was given on the </p>

<p> ethnic composition of the sample. Attrition was not </p>

<p> analyzed but was approximately 6%. </p>

<p> The results showed that D.A.R.E. had a statistically
significant </p>

<p> effect in the desired direction on one social skills </p>

<p> indicator (choices in a risk situation). D.A.R.E. did </p>

<p> not have statistically significant effects on another </p>

<p> social skills indicator (assertiveness) or on subjects' </p>

<p> attitudes about drug use. </p>

<p> 3. Illinois-C </p>

<p> The Illinois-C evaluation of D.A.R.E. (Ennett, Rosenbaum, </p>

<p> Flewelling, Bieler, Ringwalt, &amp; Bailey, 1994) used both </p>

<p> an experimental and quasi-experimental design: 12 pairs </p>

<p> of schools serving urban and suburban areas were randomly </p>

<p> assigned to D.A.R.E. and control conditions, while 6 </p>

<p> pairs serving rural areas were assigned using a nonrandom </p>

<p> procedure. The study matched schools on metropolitan </p>

<p> status, ethnic composition, number of students with </p>

<p> English proficiency, and percentage of pupils from low- </p>

<p> income families; administered a pretest and three </p>

<p> posttests (immediately, 1 year, and 2 years after </p>

<p> implementation); matched subjects from pretest to </p>

<p> posttest; used measures that were standardized scales or </p>

<p> derived from existing measures; controlled for pretest </p>

<p> values on outcome variables and initial nonequivalence </p>

<p> between the comparison groups; adjusted for school </p>

<p> effects with a nested cohort strategy; and assessed </p>

<p> attrition. The sample included 1,323 subjects who were </p>

<p> fifth and sixth graders at pretest; 54% were white, 22% </p>

<p> were African American, 9% Hispanic, and 15% were American </p>

<p> Indian, Asian American, or &quot;other.&quot; The attrition
rate </p>

<p> over the three posttests was 26% and did not differ </p>

<p> across experimental conditions. </p>

<p> The results showed that D.A.R.E. had statistically
significant </p>

<p> effects in the desired direction on subjects' self- </p>

<p> esteem, attitude toward police, and increased use of </p>

<p> cigarettes at immediate posttest. D.A.R.E. did not have </p>

<p> statistically significant effects on subjects' attitudes </p>

<p> about drugs (general attitude toward drugs, attitude </p>

<p> toward use of specific drugs, perceived benefits of </p>

<p> cigarette use and alcohol use; perceived costs of </p>

<p> cigarette use and alcohol use; perceived media influence </p>

<p> on smoking and beer drinking); social skills </p>

<p> (assertiveness and peer refusal skills); or on other drug </p>

<p> use behavior (initiation of alcohol, cigarettes, or heavy </p>

<p> drinking; increased use of alcohol or heavy drinking; or </p>

<p> quitting alcohol). </p>

<p> 4. Kentucky-A </p>

<p> The Kentucky-A evaluation of D.A.R.E. (Clayton, Cattarello,
Day, </p>

<p> &amp; Walden, 1991a; Clayton, Cattarello, &amp; Walden,
1991b) </p>

<p> used an experimental design employing random assignment </p>

<p> of 31 schools to either D.A.R.E. or control conditions.=20 </p>

<p> The study administered a pretest and three posttests </p>

<p> (immediately, 1 year, and 2 years after implementation); </p>

<p> matched subjects from pretest to posttest; used measures </p>

<p> that were standardized scales or derived from existing </p>

<p> measures; controlled for pretest values on outcome </p>

<p> variables and initial nonequivalence between the </p>

<p> comparison groups; and assessed attrition. The sample </p>

<p> included 1,925 subjects who were sixth graders at </p>

<p> pretest; 76% were white and 21% were African American.=20 </p>

<p> The attrition rate over the three posttests was </p>

<p> approximately 21% and did not differ across experimental </p>

<p> conditions. </p>

<p> The results showed that, at immediate posttest, D.A.R.E. had </p>

<p> statistically significant effects in the desired </p>

<p> direction on some indicators of subjects' attitudes about </p>

<p> drugs (general attitudes about drugs and negative </p>

<p> attitudes about alcohol, cigarettes, and marijuana).=20 </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. did not have statistically significant effects </p>

<p> at immediate posttest on other indicators of subjects' </p>

<p> attitudes about drug use (positive attitudes about </p>

<p> alcohol, cigarettes, and marijuana), social skills, self- </p>

<p> esteem, or drug use behavior (use of alcohol, cigarettes, </p>

<p> and marijuana). </p>

<p> 5. Kentucky-B </p>

<p> The Kentucky-B evaluation of D.A.R.E. (Faine &amp; Bohlander
1988, </p>

<p> 1989) used a quasi-experimental research design in which </p>

<p> 16 schools, stratified by school type (rural, inner-city, </p>

<p> suburban, and parochial), were randomly selected among </p>

<p> schools assigned to receive D.A.R.E. immediately or at a </p>

<p> later semester (a delayed intervention comparison group).=20 </p>

<p> The study administered a pretest and two posttests </p>

<p> (immediately and one year after implementation); matched </p>

<p> subjects from pretest to posttest; used measures that </p>

<p> were standardized scales or derived from existing </p>

<p> measures; and controlled for pretest values on outcome </p>

<p> variables and type of school. The sample in the first </p>

<p> year included 783 fifth-grade pupils; sample demographic </p>

<p> characteristics were not given. Attrition information </p>

<p> was not given. By year 2, all the comparison groups had </p>

<p> received the D.A.R.E. program. </p>

<p> The immediate posttest results showed that D.A.R.E. had </p>

<p> statistically significant effects in the desired </p>

<p> direction on subjects' knowledge about drugs, attitudes </p>

<p> about drug use, social skills, self-esteem, and attitude </p>

<p> toward police. </p>

<p> 6. Minnesota </p>

<p> The Minnesota evaluation of D.A.R.E. (McCormick &amp;
McCormick, </p>

<p> 1992) used a quasi-experimental research design in which </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. was implemented by semester in 63 schools; </p>

<p> random samples of D.A.R.E. participants and pupils who </p>

<p> would receive D.A.R.E. in the next semester (a delayed </p>

<p> intervention comparison group) were drawn. The study </p>

<p> administered a pretest and immediate posttest; matched </p>

<p> subjects from pretest to posttest; used measures that </p>

<p> were standardized scales or derived from existing </p>

<p> measures; assessed pretest equivalence on selected </p>

<p> demographic variables; and controlled for pretest values </p>

<p> on outcome variables. The sample included 943 fifth </p>

<p> graders; 62% of the D.A.R.E. group participants were </p>

<p> white; 18% Asian Americans, 12% African American, and 7% </p>

<p> Native American or Hispanic (demographic information on </p>

<p> the comparison group was not given). The attrition rate </p>

<p> was 9%. </p>

<p> The results showed that D.A.R.E. had a statistically
significant </p>

<p> effect in the desired direction on subjects' knowledge </p>

<p> about drugs. D.A.R.E. did not have statistically </p>

<p> significant effects on subjects' attitudes about drug </p>

<p> use, social skills, self-esteem, or attitude toward </p>

<p> police. </p>

<p> 7. North Carolina </p>

<p> The North Carolina evaluation of D.A.R.E. (Ringwalt, Ennett,
&amp; </p>

<p> Holt, 1991) used an experimental research design </p>

<p> employing random assignment of 20 schools to either </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. or control conditions. The study administered a </p>

<p> pretest and immediate posttest; matched subjects from </p>

<p> pretest to posttest; used measures that were standardized </p>

<p> scales or derived from existing measures; controlled for </p>

<p> pretest values on outcome variables and initial </p>

<p> nonequivalence between the comparison groups; adjusted </p>

<p> for school effects; and assessed attrition. The sample </p>

<p> included 1,270 fifth- and sixth-grade students; 50% were </p>

<p> African American, 40% were white, and 10% were American </p>

<p> Indian, Asian American, or Hispanic. The attrition rate </p>

<p> was 9% and did not differ across experimental conditions. </p>

<p> The results showed that D.A.R.E. had statistically
significant </p>

<p> effects in the desired direction on subjects' attitudes </p>

<p> about drugs (general attitude toward drugs, attitude </p>

<p> toward use of specific drugs, perceived peer attitude </p>

<p> toward drug use, perceived costs of using alcohol and </p>

<p> cigarettes, and perceptions of the media portrayal of </p>

<p> beer drinking and cigarette smoking) and social skills </p>

<p> (assertiveness). D.A.R.E. did not have statistically </p>

<p> significant effects on subjects' drug use behavior </p>

<p> (alcohol, cigarettes, or inhalant use). </p>

<p> 8. South Carolina </p>

<p> The South Carolina evaluation of D.A.R.E. (Harmon, 1993) used
a </p>

<p> quasi-experimental research design in which five schools </p>

<p> were assigned to receive D.A.R.E. and six schools matched </p>

<p> on demographic characteristics were selected for the </p>

<p> comparison condition. The study administered a pretest </p>

<p> and immediate posttest; matched subjects from pretest to </p>

<p> posttest; used measures that were standardized scales or </p>

<p> derived from existing measures; controlled for pretest </p>

<p> values on outcome variables and initial nonequivalence </p>

<p> between the comparison groups; and assessed attrition.=20 </p>

<p> The sample included 602 fifth-grade pupils. The </p>

<p> attrition rate was 13.5% in the D.A.R.E. group and 16.3% </p>

<p> in the comparison groups. </p>

<p> The results showed that D.A.R.E. had statistically
significant </p>

<p> effects in the desired direction on subjects' attitudes </p>

<p> about drugs, social skills (assertiveness), and </p>

<p> initiation of alcohol use in the past year. D.A.R.E. did </p>

<p> not have statistically significant effects on subjects' </p>

<p> self-esteem, attitude toward police, or other drug use </p>

<p> behavior indicators (previous year tobacco and marijuana </p>

<p> use, and previous month cigarette, alcohol, and marijuana </p>

<p> use). </p>
