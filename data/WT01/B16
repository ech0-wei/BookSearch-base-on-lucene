<P><br><br><br>POTENTIAL OFFERORS AND OTHER INTERESTED PARTIES
<p> REQUEST FOR COMMENT<p><U>INTRODUCTION
<P></U>The Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management
(OCRWM), anticipates seeking competitive proposals for commercial spent nuclear fuel (SNF)
acceptance, transportation and delivery services, including the provision of storage equipment, in
accordance with the enclosed draft Request for Proposal (RFP). 
<P> The draft RFP has benefited from public review and comment on an earlier draft Statement
of Work (SOW) and a presolicitation public conference held with interested parties in July 1996.
This letter provides some specific information contained in the draft RFP but is not a formal part
of the document. 
<P> DOE is seeking comment on all aspects of the proposed contracting approach embodied in
the draft RFP. DOE encourages private sector thought and comment on innovative approaches to
meeting DOE's mission objectives, including logistics (e.g., waste acceptance, transport and
delivery); financing (e.g., equity return, debt structuring, risk allocation); operations (e.g.,
improvements to Purchaser (as defined below) sites which result in a lower price); and
institutional issues (e.g., intra-and inter-regional agreements on waste acceptance, transport and
delivery).
<P> In this procurement, DOE is relying on private industry to use the innovative powers of the
marketplace to help DOE accomplish its objectives. The overall goal of the contracting
framework embodied in the draft RFP is to improve mission performance and reduce overall
costs without diminishing the standards of safety and environmental protection. As a result of the
proposed approach, DOE recognizes the potential for a variety of teaming arrangements among
private sector participants.
<P><U>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES
<P></U>Under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, as amended (NWPA), DOE is
responsible for accepting and transporting SNF from owners and generators of SNF to a Federal
facility for storage or disposal. The Standard Contract for Disposal of Spent Fuel and/or
High-Level Radioactive Waste (10 CFR Part 961) details the arrangements between the DOE and
owners and generators of SNF (Purchasers) for DOE to accept the SNF at the Purchasers' sites
for transport to a Federal facility. Section 137(a)2 of the NWPA requires the utilization of private
industry to the &quot;fullest extent possible&quot; in the transportation of SNF. 
<P> DOE's proposed privatization contracting approach is consistent with Administration and
Congressional calls to &quot;make government work better and cost less&quot; by stimulating
and securing private sector interest, involvement and innovation in the provision of goods and
services. The proposed approach is also in accordance with the Department's (DOE) Strategic
Alignment and Contract Reform Initiatives which are intended to capture the innovative and
competitive power of market mechanisms to support government-sponsored activities.
<P><U>CONTRACT DESCRIPTION
<P></U>
<H4><A NAME="A1"><B>Contract Phases</B></A></H3>
<P> To achieve DOE's intended objectives and to provide capability to respond to contingencies,
the continental United States has been divided geographically into four service regions for
purposes of this procurement. The draft RFP calls for a three-phased approach to the private
sector's provision of the required services. The phasing is to facilitate contract definition and
performance. The anticipated contract phases are:
<P><UL><UL><LI>Phase A -- Development of Service Plans -- lasting 12 months.<LI>Phase B
-- Acquisition of Hardware Items and Mobilization -- lasting 8 years.<LI>Phase C -- SNF
Acceptance and Transport--Commencing after a Federal storage or disposal facility has been
designated and becomes operational.
<P></UL></UL> To maximize competition, an offeror will be expected to submit proposals to
service each region in Phase A, but only one contractor per region will be authorized to proceed
to Phase B. Each contractor will be eligible to receive authorization to proceed to Phase B for up
to two regions. Contractors awarded contracts for a service will be referred to as Regional
Servicing Agents (RSA).
<P> In Phase A, contractors will develop the four regional plans necessary for contractor
acquisition of equipment and carrier services, acceptance and transportation of SNF and delivery
of storage containers to a designated Federal facility, i.e., Phases B and C. 
<P> In Phase B, a contractor will develop the capability to implement plans delivered in Phase
A. Phase B encompasses pre-operational start-up preparations prior to accepting SNF for
transport and delivery, including development and acquisition of required hardware and facilities,
mobilization of resources and provision of initial storage systems and supporting hardware.
Phase B also includes the production and delivery of storage modules and single, dual-purpose
and/or multi-purpose canisters, cask-related lifting hardware items, ancillary equipment and
transporters, if required, for the Federal facility. To address a potential need for additional on-
site storage equipment by Purchasers, it is anticipated that the final RFP will include a request for
priced options for a variety of on-site storage systems beyond those quantities necessary to
transportation to a Federal facility in the event on-site storage is determined to be appropriate.
<P> Phase C represents the operational or service phase of the contract. Upon authorization of
Phase C activities, the contractor will commence waste acceptance and transportation operations
and delivery of Purchaser SNF to a Federal facility. The contractor must provide additional
Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) approved storage containers and other related hardware
to a receiving Federal facility for canistered SNF. In addition, when authorized by DOE, the
contractor will also provide NRC-approved storage systems for uncanistered SNF to designated
Purchasers. RSA contractors will ultimately deliver these systems to a Federal facility for
subsequent storage.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="A2"><B>Number of Awards</B></A></H4>
<P> DOE intends to award one or more contracts in Phase A resulting from this RFP. Phase A
deliverables will enable the Department to assess the ability and cost-effectiveness of potential
service contractors to perform the subsequent phases. It is anticipated that, at the end of the initial
Phase C five-year period and for each succeeding five-year period, new competitive contracts
will be awarded for continuing the service activities.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="A3"><B>Contract Award Period and Schedule</B></A></H4>
<P> The overall Waste Acceptance, Storage and Transportation (WAST) project is anticipated to
last approximately forty years. DOE therefore anticipates periodically seeking competitive
proposals from potential offerors on a regional basis over the forty-year period. DOE's current
plans call for Phase A contract award(s) in April 1998 based on a July 1997 RFP release date.
Phase A provides a twelve-month period for contractor production of deliverables, and up to five
months for evaluation by DOE of Phase A deliverables. Phase B would begin approximately
seventeen months after the award of Phase A contract(s), subject to completion of the National
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) review. Phase C is anticipated to commence at the end of the
third year of Phase B, (i.e., year 2002) after Congress has designated a Federal facility location.
Phase C commencement is contingent on DOE establishing SNF receiving capability at a yet to
be designated Federal facility.
<P><U>PRIVATIZATION STRATEGY APPROACH
<P></U>
<H4><A NAME="A4"><B>General</B></A></H4>
<P> The privatization concept as embodied in this draft RFP provides for DOE to purchase
services from a contractor-owned, contractor-operated waste acceptance, transport and delivery
operation. The Contractor must: finance the project; acquire the necessary hardware needed to
support the specified SNF delivery rates; apply for and receive required permits, licenses and
approvals; interact with State, Tribal and local governments regarding institutional issues such as
routing and prenotification; provide any facilities needed to support operation of the system
(unless provided otherwise); and deliver the waste to a Federal storage or disposal facility. The
contractor will be required to deactivate the facilities and equipment no longer required and
dispose of all scrap and waste materials, including any hazardous waste and low level waste,
generated through the performance of this contract. All costs for disposal of deactivated items,
unused materials and waste material will be the responsibility of the contractor. 
<P>
<H4><A NAME="A5"><B>Project Risks</B></A></H4>
<P> It is the intention of DOE's privatization approach to allocate the financial, regulatory,
performance and operational risks between DOE and the contractor in an equitable manner that
both protects the interests of the Government and encourages industry participation. The draft
RFP includes provisions for economic price adjustments and allowable financing costs in the
event of a termination for convenience by the Government. Contractors are invited to submit
comments on an appropriate risk allocation between DOE and the contractors. 
<P> Because of the nature of the SNF, the contractor must operate in a strict regulatory
environment. DOE's proposed approach is to minimize DOE involvement and, to the maximum
extent practicable, rely on established and functioning external regulatory authorities. The
contractor must comply with all NRC and Department of Transportation (DOT) rules and
regulations governing the acquisition and operational phases of the procurement activity (Phases
B and C, respectively). To the extent permitted by law, the contractor will be responsible for
obtaining in its own name, and will be solely responsible for compliance with, all necessary
permits, authorizations and approvals from Federal, State, Tribal and local regulatory agencies,
and will assume financial liability for fines and penalties.
<P> Indemnification under the Price Anderson Act will be provided for nuclear risks. With
regard to non-nuclear risks, the contractor will be required to self-insure or maintain
commercially available insurance in sufficient amounts to cover any potential claims arising out
of the contract work.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="A6"><B>National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)
Compliance</B></A></H4>
<P> Contractors will be required to prepare Phase A deliverables that provide environmental
data necessary for DOE to comply with NEPA requirements and to allow appropriate
documentation to be prepared. This information must describe foreseeable environmental
impacts resulting from the implementation of activities to be conducted in Phases B and C.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="A7"><B>Additional Proposal and Contract Elements</B></A></H4>
<P> An offeror will be required to submit a business and finance plan as a part of its proposal. A
principal purpose of the plan is to demonstrate that the contractor has the financial resources and
backing to achieve the goals of this procurement. The plan would cover (a) how the contractor
will finance Phases B and C; and (b) the sources and amounts of equity capital, third party debt
or equity financing, and other financial resources employable to ensure contract performance.
The successful offeror will also be required to submit a performance guarantee signed by the
contractor's parent company.
<P> DOE has structured the initial phase (Phase A) of the contract to be
&quot;cost-shared.&quot; DOE intends to offer the same ceiling fixed-price amount for work
performed in Phase A. Upon satisfactory completion of all Phase A deliverables, the contractor
will receive the specified fixed-price amount irrespective of actual contractor costs. 
<P> No payments are expected to be made to contractors during Phase B. Costs of the Phase B
work are expected to be recovered in the prices for Phase C services. Pricing of Phase C
deliverables and pricing of potential Phase B and estimated Phase C termination costs will be
developed and delivered during Phase A. Accordingly, after the successful completion of Phase
A, DOE will not make payments to the contractor until commencement of SNF delivery at a
designated Federal facility (Phase C). It is anticipated that payment will be made at a fixed unit
price per metric ton of SNF delivered. This price may vary by service region.
<P> DOE funding for Phases B and C is subject to future appropriations. DOE is planning to
propose, as part of future funding requests, funding for appropriate termination for convenience
liabilities.

<H3> <A NAME="A2"> <B> 1.1 OBJECTIVE </B> </A> </H3>
<P>
 The objective of this procurement is to contract with private industry for the provision of waste
acceptance, transportation, and delivery services, and storage equipment for commercial spent
nuclear fuel. Provision of these services and equipment will enable the Office of Civilian
Radioactive Waste Management (OCRWM) of the Department of Energy (DOE) to meet its
obligations as defined in the Nuclear Waste Policy Act as amended. For purposes of this
solicitation the continental United States has been divided into four regions as shown on Figure
1.1; more detailed figures of the regions are provided in Appendix A. Each contractor (hereafter
called a &quot;Regional Servicing Agent&quot;) shall be responsible for all activities and
services in its region, including the provision of transportation and storage casks, canisters,
storage modules, and ancillary equipment, as required to accept the spent nuclear fuel and
transport it from the Purchaser
<A NAME="FOOTBODY_1"></A>
<SUP><A HREF="#FOOTNOTE_1">1</A></SUP>
 Sites to a designated Federal Facility for storage or disposal. 
<P>
 A secondary objective of this procurement is to establish a source of supply for on-site storage
systems to be delivered to selected Purchasers at OCRWM's option. 
<P>
<H3> <A NAME="A3"> <B> 1.2 PROGRAM SUMMARY </B> </A> </H3>
<P>
 OCRWM is responsible for implementing the provisions of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act as
amended (NWPA). The NWPA requires, among other things, that the Department provide for
waste acceptance, transportation, and disposal of spent nuclear fuel (SNF) or high-level
radioactive waste from Purchasers who have entered into Purchaser disposal contract(s)
<A NAME="FOOTBODY_2"></A>
<SUP><A HREF="#FOOTNOTE_2">2</A></SUP>
 with the Secretary of Energy for such services. 
<P>
 Consistent with the NWPA, the Department plans to &quot;. . . utilize . . . private industry to the
fullest extent possible . . .&quot; for the performance of transportation activities as authorized by
Congress. To this extent, OCRWM is pursuing an acquisition process that is market driven, that
is, OCRWM will rely on private industry to provide all of the necessary services and hardware
items required to fulfill OCRWM's waste acceptance and transportation mission at competitive
prices. The intent is to develop a market infrastructure to foster competition and innovative
approaches to waste acceptance and transportation services and to produce results at a best value
for the Civilian Radioactive Waste Management Program.

 The RSA shall provide Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) approved transportation systems
suitable for use at Purchasers' facilities for loading of SNF for shipment to the Federal Facility.
Transportation systems could include dual-purpose (transport/storage) or multi-purpose
(transport/storage/disposal) casks and canister-based transport/storage systems (both hereafter
referred to as &quot;dual-purpose systems&quot;) and transport-only casks for uncanistered
SNF. The dual purpose system or transport cask that the RSA proposes to use at a Purchaser's
site must be compatible with the Purchaser facility capabilities for handling and loading SNF. It
is expected that the Federal Facility will accept only canistered SNF during the first several years
of operation. Thereafter, either canistered SNF or uncanistered SNF will be accepted provided
the Federal Facility has the capability to handle the transport cask systems. 
<P>
<DD>
 The RSA shall ensure that all SNF designated for loading is in compliance with the requirements
contained in the SNF Verification Plan (Appendix C). All necessary ancillary cask-handling
equipment shall be provided to the Purchaser's site by the RSA. While at the Purchaser's facility,
the Purchaser will be responsible for incidental maintenance, protection, and preservation of all
equipment furnished to the Purchaser by the RSA for the loading and shipment of SNF.
Appropriate documentation shall be provided by the RSA to the Purchasers to demonstrate
equipment compliance with NRC regulations. The RSA shall provide cask-handling training to
personnel at sites to be serviced. The casks will be loaded and prepared for off-site shipment by
the Purchasers under the Purchaser's Quality Assurance (QA) Program and the requirements of
the NRC Certificate of Compliance. 
<p>
<DD>
 The RSA shall conduct, or be responsible for, all shipping arrangements, including the provision
of appropriate transport carrier services, on-site/near-site intermodal transfer services, advance
notifications, in-transit physical protection/escort services, and payment of State-imposed tolls,
fees and permits. The RSA shall determine the transportation routes in accordance with the
regulatory requirements of the Department of Transportation and provide descriptions of these
routes to the NRC for approval. The RSA shall provide OCRWM information copies of all
transportation route descriptions prior to their submission to the NRC. Also, the RSA shall
interact with State and Tribal governments as necessary to support selection of the shipping
routes. The RSA shall accept title to the SNF on behalf of OCRWM and be the Shipping Agent

 The RSA shall be responsible for providing the Operator of the Federal Facility with the
appropriate storage systems for the SNF being delivered. Depending on storage needs, this will
necessitate the provision of either storage modules for canistered SNF or single-purpose canisters
and storage modules for uncanistered SNF. All equipment required to handle a transportation
cask or a canister including, but not limited to the equipment required to remove impact limiters
from a transportation cask, remove a transportation cask from its transporter and rotate it to a
vertical position, remove the lid from a transportation cask, remove a dual-purpose canister from
a transportation cask, install a dual-purpose canister into a storage module, and move the storage
module to its storage location shall be provided to the Federal Facility Operator by the RSA. Any

Facility Operator by the RSA if such equipment is not the same as the equipment required for the
original action. However, any utilities, services, cranes, and standard tools readily available from
commercial sources shall be furnished by the Federal Facility Operator. 
<P>
<DD>
 The RSA shall be responsible for taking appropriate action to correct non-compliance with NRC
regulations for any shipment. 
<P>
<DD>
 While the RSA's transportation cask system equipment is physically located at the Federal
Facility, the Federal Facility Operator is responsible for protecting and preserving the equipment
to include performing all incidental maintenance required to maintain the equipment in a
condition suitable for shipment off-site. Routine transportation cask and transportation
equipment maintenance, such as periodic transportation cask maintenance, repairs and scheduled
overhauls, are the responsibility of the RSA. The RSA is responsible for providing all required
spare parts, such as seals, bolts, threaded inserts, etc; to the Federal Facility Operator to support
the incidental maintenance of the RSA's equipment while it is at the Federal Facility.

<H3> <A NAME="A10"> <B> 1.5 QUALITY ASSURANCE REQUIREMENTS </B> </A>
</H3>
<P>
 OCRWM nuclear activities are subject to NRC regulations for Quality Assurance. These QA
regulations and related controls have been implemented throughout OCRWM in the Quality
Assurance Requirements and Description (QARD). OCRWM procured items and services
subject to NRC regulation that could affect the health and safety of the public must comply with
and be controlled under the applicable provisions of the QARD. Therefore, OCRWM contractors
performing work on contracts and delivering items and/or services subject to the controls of the
QARD must perform the work in compliance with the provisions of the QARD and an OCRWM
approved QA Program. The applicability of the specific provisions of the QARD to the
contractor and each of its subcontractors' work is dependent upon the nature of the work scope
and the apportionment of the work scope among the contractor and its subcontractors and the
contractual arrangements between the participants. The applicable requirements of the QARD
flow from OCRWM to the contractor, who in turn must flow down those specific applicable
QARD requirements to its subcontractors.

</A> </H3>
<P>
 The RSA work scope is structured to represent the logical and chronological occurrence of the
distinct work activities. The work segments are called phases, and include: Phase A -
Development of Servicing Plans, Phase B - Acquisition of Hardware Items and Mobilization, and
Phase C - SNF Acceptance and Transport. The purpose of the twelve-month Phase A Planning
work scope is to obtain comprehensive plans and pricing for the work scope defined in both
Phase B and Phase C from each contractor awarded a Regional Servicing Contract. For an RSA
selected by DOE to proceed with Phase B and Phase C, the initial three years of the Phase B
work scope involves the total effort of marshaling the required hardware items, software,
facilities and personnel and preparing to startup waste acceptance and transportation operations
plus the following five years of management and acquisition of required hardware. Phase C,
commencing about three years after start of Phase B, is the five years of waste acceptance and
transportation operations. 
<P>
<H3> <A NAME="A22"> <B> 2.2 PHASE A: DEVELOPMENT OF SERVICING PLANS
</B> </A> </H3>
<P>
 During the twelve-month Phase A, the RSA shall contact each Purchaser with a waste
acceptance allocation within its region and develop Purchaser-approved Purchaser Site Service
Plans; prepare an integrated Regional Servicing Plan; determine required quantities of
transportation and storage components; determine software, personnel, services, and facilities
requirements; prepare a management plan for Phase B and Phase C work scope; and prepare
pricing for Phase C work scope based on the plans and requirements estimates. The Phase A
plans, requirements development, and pricing shall be based on the Regional Waste Acceptance
Schedule (Appendix B). This is the starting point from which the RSA shall initiate discussions
and planning with the Purchasers in its region. The RSA shall deliver the specified quantities of
Purchasers' SNF from the region to the Federal Facility. 
<P>
 The RSA may propose in its Purchaser Site Service Plans and Regional Servicing Plan any
reasonable approaches agreeable to the affected Purchasers. Changes to the Regional Servicing
Plan that affect the delivery schedule or types of transportation cask systems to be used for
delivery of SNF require prior Federal Facility Operator concurrence. 
<P>
<H3> <A NAME="A23"> <B> 2.3 PHASE B: ACQUISITION OF HARDWARE ITEMS AND
MOBILIZATION </B> </A> </H3>
<P>
 Phase B is anticipated to last approximately eight years; the first three years of this phase will
cover pre-operational activities and hardware acquisition, and the last five years will cover
management and continuing transportation cask and storage system hardware acquisition needed
to support the SNF delivery rates during the Phase C waste acceptance and transportation
operations. 
<P>
 OCRWM will only accept delivery and take title to SNF canisters, storage modules, and the
ancillary equipment, with an initial supply of repair parts, required for handling of casks and
canisters and supporting Federal Facility operations. The RSA shall acquire all other hardware
items either through lease or purchase; title to these items shall remain with the RSA or the
lessors. 
<P>
 The pre-operational activities shall include acquisition of dual-purpose systems and related
hardware items needed for startup; provision of a startup supply of storage modules for the
Federal Facility; utility interface activities; coordination with the Federal Facility Operator and
other RSAs; refinement of Purchaser Site Service Plans and the Regional Servicing Plan;
establishment of an operating capability for waste acceptance and transportation; preparation of
procedures and training materials; staffing and training of personnel; performance of institutional
and outreach activities with the public and representatives of local, State and Tribal
organizations; establishment of contracts with carriers, escort services, communication service
suppliers, and other suppliers of needed services; selection of routes; and other pre-operational
activities necessary to support SNF acceptance and transport. 
<P>
 Prior to commencement of Phase C operations, the RSA shall provide dual-purpose systems
and/or canisters in quantities needed for startup operations to those Purchasers in its region in
accordance with the Regional Servicing Plan. 
<P>
 Prior to initiation of SNF shipments at the commencement of Phase C operations and consistent
with the Regional Servicing Plan, the RSA shall provide NRC-approved storage modules
suitable for use at the NRC-licensed Federal Facility for canistered SNF. All equipment required
to handle a transportation cask or a canister including, but not limited to the equipment required
to remove impact limiters from a transportation cask, remove a transportation cask from its

<H2>APPENDIX B - REGIONAL WASTE ACCEPTANCE SCHEDULES</H2>
<HR>
<P></B>This Appendix contains a waste acceptance schedule for each of the four regions for the
first five years of operation. The system waste acceptance rate is based on legislation which was
passed by the Senate in 1996 (S-1936) and is subject to change when new legislation is enacted.
<P> The allocation to each Purchaser is based on the 1995 Acceptance Priority Ranking with all
spent nuclear fuel owned by the Department of Energy deleted. Note that the allocations are to
the Purchasers and are not sub-allocated to sites or reactors. It is expected that an additional
breakdown will be available prior to release of the final Request for Proposal.
<P> Maps of the Servicing Regions are in Appendix A with all reactors and storage sites shown.
This Appendix includes only those Purchasers with an allocation in the first five years of
operation assuming that 9100 MTU will be picked up.
<P> The distribution of Purchasers by region is shown in Table B-1 below:

</H3>
<P>
Verification will be conducted on all waste that is accepted into the Civilian Radioactive Waste
Management System (CRWMS). Verification will consist of collecting information concerning
the type, quantity, and nature of the materials to be accepted, confirming that the information
collected is complete, and documenting certain physical attributes of the material, including
identity. Once collected and verified, the information will be used by the CRWMS to
demonstrate that appropriate safeguards are in place. 
<P>
 This Verification Plan establishes the conceptual framework for the verification process. From
this plan, detailed procedures will be developed to implement the verification process. Two
factors will significantly impact the nature of the process. First, the information collected during
verification will be used for Material Control and Accounting (MC&amp;A) purposes, which is
beyond the scope of the verification process outlined in the 
<I>
Standard Contract for Disposal of Spent Nuclear Fuel and/or High-Level Radioactive Waste

</I>
 (10 CFR 961, the Standard Contract- Reference 1). Secondly, several Purchasers are currently
investigating
the feasibility of using dual purpose canisters for the storage of spent nuclear fuel at their sites
and transporting the spent nuclear fuel to a Federal facility at the time of acceptance. If these
canisters are used, there is no intent to re-open the canisters prior to DOE's acceptance. These
canisters may be used as early as 1997. 
<P>
<H3> <A NAME="A4"> <B> 1.1 SCOPE </B> </A> </H3>
<P>
 This plan presents the verification process in terms of the Standard Contract, and identifies areas
where the requirements outlined in the Standard Contract must be slightly modified to allow for
the implementation of the verification process described in this plan. These modifications will
allow the Purchasers to use various types of sealed multi-element canisters within the framework
of the verification process. This version of the Verification Plan is limited to a discussion of the
process that will be implemented for commercial spent nuclear fuel, whether canistered or
uncanistered prior to acceptance. The term &quot;waste&quot; throughout this document refers
to spent nuclear fuel, as defined in Appendix E of the Standard Contract. The term
&quot;canistered fuel&quot; refers to fuel that has been placed in a sealed, multi-assembly
canister at the Purchaser's site with the intent of not re-opening the canister prior to its delivery to
a Department of Energy (the Department or DOE) facility. Such a canister may be dual or
multi-purpose. 
<P>
 This plan also identifies the specific information that must be collected for MC&amp;A
purposes. A determination of the system (electronic and/or conventional) that will be required to
store and retrieve this information in order to accomplish item control and continuity of
knowledge has not been made at this time. 
<P>
<H3> <A NAME="A5"> <B> 1.2 DOCUMENT ORGANIZATION </B> </A> </H3>
<P>
 This plan is organized into five sections, followed by references, a list of acronyms and a
glossary. The main sections are: Introduction, Requirements, Data Validation, Item Verification,
and Procedures. 
<P>
 Section 2, Requirements, discusses the basis for the development of this plan and explains the
need for expanding the process beyond the scope of the Standard Contract. The specific
requirements that the verification process must meet are discussed in detail. 
<P>
 Section 3, Data Validation, identifies the specific data that will be collected during the
verification process and describes, conceptually, how the data will be validated. This information
will serve as the basis for establishing &quot;continuity of knowledge&quot; of the special
nuclear material (SNM) content of the waste, which is necessary to comply with MC&amp;A
requirements, and must therefore be permanently retained. 
<P>
 Section 4, Item Verification is the confirmation of the characteristics and identity of the waste
being delivered through physical inspection, as opposed to the validation of information
concerning the waste. The item verification process is crucial to meeting the system goal of
avoiding the necessity of re-opening sealed canisters for safeguards-related reasons once they
have been sealed at a Purchaser's site. This verification will take place when a canister is sealed
and when waste is accepted by the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management
(OCRWM). 
<P>
 Finally, Section 5 identifies the procedures that must be developed in order to implement the
process discussed in this Plan. Included in these detailed procedures will be a detailed checklist
that will be used to ensure that all actions necessary to accomplish verification are completed.

Public Law 97-425, the &quot;Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982&quot; (NWPA), as amended
by Public Law 100-203, the &quot;Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 1987,&quot;
establishes Federal responsibility for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel (SNF) and high-level
radioactive waste (HLW). The NWPA also established OCRWM to carry out theses functions of
the Department. Under this authority, OCRWM promulgated the Standard Contract, which
identifies, in general terms, the waste form data which must be provided to the Department upon
delivery and transfer of title. These data requirements include, among other things, the data
needed to verify the quantity and certain characteristics of the material to be accepted.

and ready for transportation, and has taken custody, as evidenced in writing, of the material at the
Purchaser's site, f.o.b. carrier. A properly executed off-site radioactive shipment record
describing cask contents must be prepared by the Purchaser along with a signed certification

 The CRWMS is being designed and implemented to meet all applicable Nuclear Regulatory
Commission (NRC) regulations for the protection of SNF. If the CRWMS is chosen for the
imposition of international safeguards, this will include the requirements contained in Title 10
Code of Federal Regulations part 75 (10 CFR 75). This obligates the US to comply with the
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) for the safeguarding of SNM contained within
SNF. Material considered to be SNM is defined in 10 CFR 73. Since some of the elements of the
CRWMS will be required to obtain licenses from the NRC, the designs will be required to
incorporate a Safeguards and Security (S&amp;S) Program that complies with NRC S&amp;S
requirements. As part of this S&amp;S Program, an MC&amp;A plan will be implemented. To
allow for this implementation, the 
<I>
Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management Material Control and Accounting Program
Plan
</I>
 (OCRWM MC&amp;A Plan - Reference 3) was developed.


<A NAME="FOOTBODY_1"></A>
<A HREF="#FOOTNOTE_1">*</A></SUP>
 This plan discusses the MC&amp;A requirements for all elements of the waste management
system. These responsibilities include collection of shipment information from Purchasers, data
verification, and management of a central database. The information collected from the
Purchasers must support the overall MC&amp;A Plan goal of establishing &quot;continuity of
knowledge&quot; for the SNF and/or HLW entering the CRWMS. In order to establish this
continuity of knowledge, some information will be required that was not anticipated in the
Standard Contract. This Verification Plan includes the collection of this additional information,
which becomes the basic data for MC&amp;A once the SNF and/or HLW is accepted. 
<P>
 &quot;Verification,&quot; as such, is not explicitly referred to in NRC regulations. In general,
NRC relies on the licensee to produce and adhere to a performance-based MC&amp;A plan. That
is, the licensees develop and implement their own program. NRC then ensures the licensee meets
these commitments by independent records audits and facility inspections. CRWMS facilities
(interim storage Facility and/or mined geologic disposal facility) will be licensed by the NRC.
While an interim storage facility is not currently being pursued as a component of the waste
management system, there is the possibility that future plans may include such a facility. Even if
an interim storage facility is not utilized, the NRC has informed OCRWM that the safeguards
requirements for such a facility (which include MC&amp;A) will be applied to the MGDS. To
allow for this, the MC&amp;A Plan commits to meeting the requirements of a storage facility
contained in 10 CFR 72.72 through 72.78. These paragraphs detail the specific reporting and
record-keeping for waste in storage. Among the requirements are &quot;...the estimated quantity
of radioactive material per item (including special nuclear material in spent fuel)...&quot;. In
addition, NRC requires submission of the DOE/NRC Nuclear Material Transaction Report (Form
741) whenever SNM is transferred between item control areas, and the semi-annual submission
of the DOE/NRC Material Balance Report (Form 742) thereafter. 
<p>
While the NRC seeks to enforce licensee commitments to a performance-based MC&amp;A
Plan, the
IAEA's goal is to prevent diversion of SNM by the State. Unlike the NRC, the IAEA considers
the State itself (including the NRC) to be the adversary, or the party diverting SNM for
non-peaceful purposes. Therefore, verification to the IAEA consists of those activities which
permit the IAEA to independently confirm the State/operator declaration of the nature and
quantity of the nuclear material. To assure the independence of its determinations, the IAEA may
employ either their own methods and techniques (e.g., tamper-indicating devices, cameras, or
measurements), or IAEA may utilize State/operator methods and techniques that have been
accorded prior IAEA approval and which can be &quot;authenticated&quot; by technical means.
The requirements for IAEA safeguards are contained in the IAEA document, 
<I>
Safeguards Criteria 1991-1995 (Reference 4)
</I> . The United States' agreement to implement IAEA safeguards (Reference 5) is codified in
10 CFR 75. 
<P>
 The entire purpose of the IAEA system is to enable the IAEA to determine that no material has
been withdrawn from locations where its safeguards have been applied. The IAEA has used a
variety of methods to provide these assurances in the past. For example, dual containment and
surveillance (C/S) is provided to assure &quot;continuity of knowledge&quot;. This C/S is
provided by two functionally independent means, where the methods utilized do not have a
common failure mode. A different level of performance is needed whenever material is prepared
for introduction into a situation which IAEA identifies as &quot;difficult to access&quot;. This
classification clearly applies to loaded sealed canisters (canistered fuel), since the individual
spent fuel assemblies become difficult to access once they are sealed in a canister. Consideration
of these IAEA requirements leads to the conclusion that before being placed into a sealed
canister, individual assemblies may have to be item identified and item counted. Further, IAEA
may conduct non-destructive assay (NDA) testing to assure that the assemblies are as claimed
and have not been replaced with other material. 
<P>
 The collection of data adequate to meet IAEA requirements on the identification and SNM
content of the individual assemblies placed into each sealed canister is provided for in this
verification plan. This data has been collected by OCRWM and the Nuclear Material
Management and Safeguard System for over thirteen years, and will continue to be collected as
sealed canisters begin to be loaded. However, because the use of NDA equipment on a
Purchaser's site would involve site licensing conditions, the imposition of the specific NDA
requirements necessary to meet IAEA standards for difficult to access material at utility sites,
which will require action by individual utilities, is the responsibility of the NRC. The NRC has
begun discussions with the IAEA regarding the implementation of these requirements
(Reference 6)
 . 
<P>
 In developing this Verification Plan, the challenge was to establish a system which will meet
IAEA requirements by requiring utilities to provide the necessary information as inexpensively
and as non-intrusively as possible, and to do so under the NRC regulatory framework. If the
decision is made to deploy sealed canisters, this should be accomplished before the first sealed
canister is loaded, which could possibly occur in 1996. In addition to these time and
non-intrusiveness constraints, OCRWM is limited to implementing this Verification Plan
through the Standard Contract and DOE/NRC Forms 741 and 742. 
<BR>
 the set of regulatory requirements discussed above, a set of specific objectives was developed for
this Verification Plan. In order to meet the specific requirements of the Standard Contract and the
overall goals related to development of an MC&amp;A Plan, this Verification Plan establishes
the conceptual basis for the development of procedures to verify the following: 
<P>
<DL>
<DL>
<DD>
 that the description of the SNF and/or HLW to be accepted by the Department is correct and
consistent with Appendices E and F of the Standard Contract (as required by 10 CFR 961.11
Article VI.B.2 and 10 CFR 72.72-72.78) 
<P>
<DD>
 that the material is properly loaded, packaged, marked, labeled, and ready for transportation (as
required by 10 CFR 961.11 Article VI.B.2) 
<P>
<DD>
 that the appropriate documents have been executed for the transfer of title (as required by 10
CFR 961.11 Article VI.B.2) 
<P>
<DD>
 that an off-site radioactive shipment record describing the cask contents has been properly
submitted (as required by 10 CFR 961.11 Article VI.B.2 and 10 CFR 72.72-72.78) 
<P>
<DD>
 that all information required to establish continuity of knowledge for the SNF and/or HLW to be
delivered, from the standpoint of OCRWM, has been collected (as required by the MGDS
MC&amp;A Plan). 
<P>
</DL>
</DL>
<H3> <A NAME="A9"> <CENTER> <B> 3. DATA VALIDATION </B> </CENTER> </A>
</H3>
<P>
Three separate components of verification will be accomplished during the waste acceptance
process: data collection and validation, waste identification and item verification at time of
delivery. This section of the verification plan will discuss the method that will be utilized to
accomplish the first component, collection and validation of the data necessary for acceptance.
Subsequent to collection, the data will be examined to ensure completeness, to avoid basic avoid
basic arithmetical errors in the submission process, and to document the consistency of the data.
Section 4 discusses the process for verification of the waste identification and item identification
at time of delivery. 
<P>
<H3> <A NAME="A10"> <B> 3.1 SCOPE OF DATA COLLECTION AND VALIDATION
</B> </A> </H3>
<P>
 Data will be collected under the verification program for two distinct purposes. First, data will
be collected to ensure that the characteristics of the waste to be accepted are documented. This is
required for proper packaging, transportation, storage, and disposal. Secondly, data will be
collected for purposes of MC&amp;A. While much of the data collected will serve both
purposes, some unique data will be required for each purpose. 
<P>
 Data must be submitted describing the physical and radiological characteristics of the material to
ensure that the accepted waste can be safely handled, transported, stored, and disposed of.
Information must include either the radiological and thermal characteristics of the waste or data
which allows them to be calculated as needed. General physical information (length, weight,
configuration, identification) will be needed to allow for adequate planning for receiving the
shipment at the OCRWM facility in terms of the equipment and casks required. Unique
information related to the waste, such as test history and known defects, should also be
documented and retained in a record system. 
<P>
 A complete MC&amp;A program requires that two different conditions be met, item control and
continuity of knowledge. Item control is related to the unique identity of each waste item. The
location and characteristics of all SNM accepted into the waste management system must be
known at all times. The system must also allow for an inspector to locate a specific waste item at
any time. This requirement will dictate that each item accepted is uniquely labeled and that the
identity and current location is recorded. Continuity of knowledge is related to the ability to
document that the waste currently in the system has been monitored and documented subsequent
to fabrication. This requirement will dictate that the history of the waste be documented from the
time it was transferred to the utility from the fabricator until it is finally placed in a repository for
disposal. For commercial SNF, this requirement will dictate that the history of the SNF be
documented from the time it was transferred to the utility from the fabricator until it is finally
placed in a repository for disposal. 
<P>
 From a thorough review of the regulations applicable to spent nuclear fuel, the MC&amp;A Plan
identifies ten general categories of information that must be collected: 
<P>
<DL>
<DL>
<DD>
 1. Type of waste 
<BR>
<DD>
 2. Form of waste 
<BR>
<DD>
 3. Physical description of waste 
<BR>
<DD>
 4. Physical description of canister, if appropriate 
<BR>
<DD>
 5. Isotopic composition of the waste prior to irradiation 
<BR>
<DD>
 6. Burnup 
<BR>
<DD>
 7. Date of discharge from the reactor 
<BR>
<DD>
 8. Quantity of special nuclear material 
<BR>
<DD>
 9. Description of any unusual incidents associated with the use or handling of the waste 
<BR>
<DD>
 10. The results of any measurements, tests, inspections, or observations associated with the
waste. 
<P>
</DL>
</DL>
 From these general categories, a list of specific necessary information has been developed. In
order to satisfy the above information needs, the following information will be collected once the
specific waste to be delivered has been identified: 
<P>
<DL>
<DL>
<DD>
 1. A unique identification number. For SNF, this will be the manufacturer's assigned
identification number, while canisters will have a separate identification number. This
identification number must be unique at least within the inventory of each individual reactor. In
this way, this identification number can be combined with the Purchaser's reactor identification
to form a completely unique number for purposes of item control. 
<P>
<DD>
 2. Indication of type of waste. For the majority of waste accepted, this will be either Boiling
Water Reactor or Pressurized Water Reactor spent fuel. There will be an &quot;other&quot;
category to accommodate deliveries of non-light water reactor spent fuel or non-fuel-bearing
components. A more complete description of the waste will be obtained through other items,
discussed below. 
<P>
<DD>
 3. Drawing file reference. This will indicate the drawing that describes the waste to be delivered
(e.g. Westinghouse 17x17). If no drawing for the specific waste to be delivered is available, the
Purchaser will be asked to supply a drawing, and a new file will be created. The goal is to
minimize the burden on utilities regarding the submission of assembly drawings, while at the
same time ensuring that adequate drawings are available for all waste to be accepted. While
duplicate drawings may inadvertently be collected, the intent is to collect only one drawing of
each assembly type and then reference this drawing for all deliveries of that type, regardless of
whether the same utility is delivering the assembly. From the drawing, the active length of the
fuel assembly, the cladding material, the overall assembly length, and the overall assembly
weight can be determined. 
<P>
<DD>
 4. Initial enrichment and uranium mass. The weight percent initial Uranium-235 (U-235)
enrichment and total initial uranium mass must be reported to allow for the calculation of
isotopic content as well as for criticality calculations. 
<P>
<DD>
 5. Post irradiation isotopic content. Specifically, U-234, U-235, U-236, U-238, Plutonium-238
(Pu-238), Pu-239, Pu-240, Pu-241, and Pu-242 content (in weight percent concentrations) at the
time that the spent nuclear fuel is permanently discharged from the reactor (final cycle end date)
must be calculated and submitted, and each must be reported separately. 
<P>
<DD>
 6. Post irradiation Uranium and Plutonium content. Total fissile Uranium and Plutonium content
(in grams) must be calculated and submitted for each assembly as of the date of discharge. This
information must be collected to allow the Department to submit DOE/NRC Forms 741 and 742
after the Department becomes responsible for reporting to NRC on the SNM. 
<P>
<DD>
 7. Final discharge burnup. The final discharge burnup of the SNF must be reported to allow for
the calculation of isotopic contents. 
<P>
<DD>
 8. Date of final discharge. This the date that the fuel was last irradiated, which is necessary to
perform decay calculations. 
<P>
<DD>
 9. Description of any unusual incidents associated with the use or handling of the waste or any
changes, whether intentional or accidental, to the fissile material content. This should include a
discussion of anything that might affect the way that the waste is handled, packaged, transported,
stored, or disposed of. Any removal of rods within the assembly must be described. 
<P>
<DD>
 10. The results of any measurements, tests, inspections, or observations associated with the
waste. This should not include the results of any testing that may be determined necessary for
acceptance (such as burnup measurements), but should instead include any measurements, tests,
inspections or observations that have been conducted by the Purchaser independent of these
requirements. 
<P>
<DD>
 11. Fabricator's/Receiver's Form 741. A copy of the DOE/NRC Form 741 that was generated
when the fresh fuel was transferred to the utility from the fabricator, including any changes to the
record made by the receiver, will be necessary to establish an initiation point for the continuity of
knowledge regarding each assembly. 
<P>
</DL>
</DL>
 The above information is anticipated to be collected through the 
<I>
Detailed Description of Purchaser's Waste
</I>
 form developed by OCRWM. If it is determined to be appropriate, the current Appendix F form
in the Standard Contract will be modified to include all of this information or replaced by the 
<I>
Detailed Description of Purchaser's Waste
</I>
 form. This information will be required prior to acceptance. 
<BR>
 crucial aspect of the entire verification process will be the storage of this data once it is
collected. Not only must the information be recorded, but the records themselves must be
controlled, since they represent the records that will establish the basis for compliance with
MC&amp;A requirements. Appropriate controls must be imposed to protect the information, and
the information must be accessible for the generation of necessary reports. 
<P>
<H3> <A NAME="A11"> <B> 3.2 THE DATA VALIDATION PROCESS </B> </A> </H3>
<P>
 Data validation will be initiated upon receipt of a 
<I>
Detailed Description of Purchaser's Waste
</I>
 form. The complete process for validating this information will be fully developed as the
procedures for implementing this plan are written. At this time, the assumption is that validation
will be accomplished by first confirming that all necessary information has been submitted for
each waste item and then comparing the information submitted to a set of known bounding
parameters, which will be based upon the information previously submitted to OCRWM. If a
data item is identified that falls outside of the bounding parameters, the Purchaser will be
requested to confirm that the value as reported is correct. If the Purchaser confirms that the value
is correct, the value will be retained. 
<P>
 This validation process assumes that all information is submitted under an NRC-approved
Quality Assurance (QA) program. No information will be accepted which is not submitted under
such a program. Because the NRC requires exhaustive confirmation of licensee calculations and
records, requiring the information to be submitted to OCRWM under an NRC QA program will
eliminate the need for OCRWM to perform any additional confirmation exercises. 
<P>
<H3> <A NAME="A12"> <CENTER> <B> 4. PHYSICAL VERIFICATION </B>
</CENTER> </A> </H3>
<P>
The verification process described in Section 3, collection and validation of the data necessary
for acceptance, will be initiated when the form describing the waste to be delivered is received.
In addition to this, there are two other components of verification that must be accomplished
prior to acceptance: waste identification and validation. While the collection and validation of
data are administrative processes, these two components are considered to be physical aspects of
verification, since they involve the verification of waste characteristics that which can be
physically observed. These components are described in this section. 
<P>
 OCRWM has not yet identified any reason to conduct measurements for purposes of waste
acceptance. Therefore, this plan does not include the requirement for any measurements.
However, Purchasers should be aware of the circumstances


<A NAME="FOOTBODY_2"></A>
<SUP><A HREF="#FOOTNOTE_2">**</A></SUP>

which may require waste measurements, even though OCRWM will not
require them for waste to be accepted. 
<P>
<H3> <A NAME="A13"> <B> 4.1 WASTE IDENTIFICATION </B> </A> </H3>
<P>
 The first component of the physical verification program is verification of the identity of the
individual items. For commercial SNF, this will consist of verifying the assembly number, and
must be accomplished immediately prior to emplacement of the assembly into either a canister
that will be sealed (i.e., welded closed with no intent of reopening) or a transportation cask. 
<P>
 Verification of the identification of the assembly will be accomplished by the Purchasers under
an NRC-approved QA procedure. It is assumed that this verification will be accomplished similar
to methods which have been previously approved by the NRC that are currently in use at utility
sites for the tracking of SNF location. For example, this verification may be accomplished by two
individuals independently reading the number of the assembly, recording this number on paper,
and then comparing the two records. The verified information will be recorded on a form
developed by OCRWM to establish a continuity-of-knowledge record for the waste. If sealed
storage canisters are used, OCRWM intends for this information to be recorded at the time the
canister is sealed. While this is not required, completing the form at the time of canister sealing
will maximize the probability that all required information is recorded in an acceptable level of
detail. Placing waste in a sealed canister will also require the recording of the canister's unique
identification number. 
<P>
 The loading of sealed canisters and/or transportation casks to be used at a facility will not
normally be witnessed by an OCRWM representative. The Purchasers will be responsible for
ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the loading data. For those loadings accomplished
prior to the implementation of this plan, the Purchasers will be required to complete the records
indicating the identity of the SNF in the sealed canister(s) and document that the information was
gathered and reported using NRC-approved QA procedures. If this cannot be documented, the
canister will have to be re-opened to verify the contents. 
<P>
 If sealed canisters are used, specific safeguards may be required in order to ensure that the
contents are not tampered with. As discussed previously, if the IAEA determines that they will
conduct safeguards activities at Purchaser sites, they may require NDA to be performed on any
SNF placed in a sealed canister and dual C/S once they are sealed. These additional requirements
would be imposed by the NRC upon the specific site affected. CRWMS will not require sealed
canisters to be opened for verification purposes if the above OCRWM requirements have been
complied with

<A NAME="FOOTBODY_3"></A>
<SUP><A HREF="#FOOTNOTE_3">***</A></SUP>
. While OCRWM cannot provide complete assurance that IAEA or NRC will not require sealed
canisters to be opened, if such a demand is made and the above requirements are followed,
OCRWM will investigate available options to insulate Purchasers from the impacts of this
re-opening. OCRWM believes that the probability is very low of either the NRC or IAEA
requiring a sealed canister which has met these requirements to be opened for purposes of
verification. Some sealed canisters may have to be opened for reasons other than verification,
such as canister performance issues. 
<P>
<H3> <A NAME="A14"> <B> 4.2 ITEM VERIFICATION AT TIME OF DELIVERY </B>
</A> </H3>
<P>
 The final component of verification will consist of verifying that the waste to be accepted by the
CRWMS is properly loaded, packaged, marked, labeled, and ready for transportation, and that
appropriate documents have been executed for the transfer of title. This verification will occur
immediately before title is transferred. 
<P>
 This component of verification will include confirmation that the identity of the waste is as
expected, whether non-canistered or canistered spent fuel is being delivered. Purchasers will
identify the specific waste they intend to deliver on a 
<I>
Detailed Description of Purchaser's Waste
</I>
 form, described earlier. This form will be required for delivery of a canister in the same manner
as it will be required for delivery of bare fuel. The specific waste offered for delivery will thus
have to match the waste identified in the form. As in the case of the verification process
described for individual assembly identification, verification of either the identity of the
non-canistered SNF placed in a transport cask or of a canister to be delivered will be
accomplished by the Purchaser using a method currently approved by the NRC for item
identification. 
<P>
 OCRWM will conduct any required inspection of the shipment and transport carrier required to
ensure that the shipment meets all regulations and is prepared for travel. Title will not be
transferred, and thus the waste will not be transported offsite, until all documentation is in place
to demonstrate that all regulations have been complied with. 
<BR>
<H3> <A NAME="A15"> <CENTER> <B> 5. PROCEDURES </B> </CENTER> </A> </H3>
<P>
This section identifies and briefly describes the procedures that must be developed in order to
implement the process discussed in this plan. These procedures will be developed separately
subsequent to the acceptance of this plan. 
<P>
<H3> <A NAME="A16"> <B> 5.1 SNF DATA VALIDATION </B> </A> </H3>
<P>
 The purpose of this procedure will be to define the process to be used to collect and store
information regarding the waste to be delivered to ensure that the waste can be safely handled,
transported, stored and disposed of. The information submitted by Purchasers will be examined
to ensure completeness, arithmetical correctness, and consistency of data. If unexpected values
are reported, they will be individually confirmed. 
<P>
 A critical part of the data validation procedures will be a description of the appropriate actions to
be taken if unexpected information is identified. Although addressing every possible unexpected
submission is not feasible, the procedures will identify generic actions to be taken to confirm that
unexpected data was intended and not typographical in nature. 
<P>
 Once the data has been validated, the data must be entered into an MC&amp;A database. The
developed procedure will describe the necessary format and content of the forms to be used to
input this data into the records database. Procedure 5.4, MC&amp;A Data Collection and
Processing, will describe the process by which this data is stored and protected. 
<P>
<H3> <A NAME="A17"> <B> 5.2 SNF LOADING VERIFICATION AND CANISTER
SURVEILLANCE </B> </A> </H3>
<P>
 The procedure will describe the actions required to accomplish individual waste item
identification verification in these situations, as well as the level of containment/surveillance that
will be required. This procedure will describe the activities required prior to loading SNF into
any type of sealed canister. This includes canisters not intended to be re-opened even for
purposes of disposal, including transportable storage casks for which disposal overpacks could be
designed, as well as the activities required prior to loading dual-purpose casks/canisters which
can be used for storage and transportation, but will be reopened at the repository. The procedure
will describe the format which must be followed in documenting and submitting this information
to OCRWM, since OCRWM personnel will not normally witness these activities. 
<P>
 Once the SNF loading verification has been completed at a Purchaser site, the verification data
must be entered into the MC&amp;A records database. This procedure will describe the format
and content of the forms to be used to input verification data into the database. Procedure 5.4,
MC&amp;A Data Collection and Processing, will describe the process by which this verification
input data is stored and protected in the records database. 
<P>
<H3> <A NAME="A18"> <B> 5.3 ACCEPTANCE/SHIPMENT PHASE VERIFICATION
</B> </A> </H3>
<P>
 This procedure will describe the activities required to verify that material to be accepted by the
CRWMS is properly loaded, packaged, marked, labeled, and ready for transportation, and that
appropriate documents have been executed for the transfer of title. The procedure will address
the acceptance of bare spent fuel as well as dual- or triple-purpose casks and canisters. The
procedure will also identify the qualifications for the OCRWM personnel who are required to be
present during SNF acceptance. 
<P>
 Procedures will be developed for documenting the identity of the waste being delivered, whether
it is canistered or non-canistered. The individual identities of the waste items and the sealed
canister, if used, must be documented prior to acceptance, via an approved NRC method of item
identification. 
<P>
 There is a possibility that transportable canisters may be used in the future at Purchaser sites
prior to the development of appropriate verification procedures by the Department. This
procedure will specify the actions required to determine whether existing records for SNF in such
transportable canisters are sufficient (from a verification standpoint) to allow the Department to
accept the unopened canisters, or whether opening of the canisters prior to acceptance is required. 
<P>
 Once the acceptance/shipment phase verification has been completed at a Purchaser site, the
verification data must be entered into the MC&amp;A records database. This procedure will
describe the format and content of the forms to be used to input verification data into the
database. Procedure 5.4, MC&amp;A Data Collection and Processing, will describe the process
by which this verification input data is stored and protected in the records database.

specified in the previously-described procedures is input into the records database, how access to
the MC&amp;A and other verification data is controlled, and how and to whom the verification

<DL>
<DD>
 Canistered Fuel: Spent nuclear fuel that is placed in a seal-welded canister prior to delivery with
no intent of re-opening. It is assumed that under normal circumstances, OCRWM will not
physically observe the identity of canistered fuel prior to acceptance. 
<P>
<DD>
 Continuity of Knowledge: The ability to document the quantities and general characteristics of
all SNM under one's control from a specified time to the present. Within the CRWMS, continuity
of knowledge for commercial SNF will be established from the point when the fuel was delivered
to the utility by the fabricator, using the fabricator's NRC/DOE Form 741 as the initiating
document. Any alterations in the quantities or general characteristics of the SNM subsequent to
this point will have to be documented in order to establish continuity of knowledge for the waste. 
<P>
<DD>
 Difficult to Access: A designation given to certain storage applications by the IAEA. By
applying this designation, the IAEA is stating that there is sufficient confidence in the continued
presence of any SNM that periodic remeasurement of the SNM quantities is unnecessary,
provided that dual containment/surveillance measures are maintained. 
<P>
<DD>
 Item: The fundamental unit for purposes of verification. Within the CRWMS, this is a spent fuel
assembly; no tracking of individual items smaller than an assembly (i.e., fuel rods) will be
accomplished. 
<P>
<DD>
 Item Control: The ability to document that, subsequent to entering a safeguarded system, all
items have been continually within one's control, with no opportunity for unauthorized access. To
demonstrate this, all items must be able to be located within the system upon demand. 
<P>
<DD>
 Item Control Area: A defined area with specific boundaries at a safeguarded facility over which
no safeguarded item is allowed to pass without being accounted for and documented, and in
which continuous control is exercised over the item. 
<P>
<DD>
 Validation: The process whereby data submitted is checked for legibility, reproducibility,
completeness, arithmetical correctness and consistency. It is meant to distinguish this process
from verifying the data, which implies an auditing process. In the case of data validation, the data
will be required to be submitted under an NRC-approved QA program, and thus verification will
not be necessary. However, validation will be performed to ensure that the data is complete and
to limit the possibility for typographical errors. 
<P>
<DD>
 Verification: The process used to demonstrate that, for all SNM within the CRWMS,
appropriate safeguards are in place and that the material is being handled and stored
appropriately from a safeguards standpoint. 
<P>
<DD>
 Waste: For this revision, this term refers exclusively to commercial SNF, as defined in 10 CFR
961.11.

 The MGDS MC&amp;A Plan was developed to cover all aspects of MC&amp;A within the
CRWMS related to the delivery of canistered SNF. The MGDS MC&amp;A Plan is currently
under revision to include a discussion of the MC&amp;A requirements for the delivery of
uncanistered SNF. As part of this revision, the title will be changed to the 
<I>
Civilian Radioactive Waste Management System Material Control and Accounting Plan
</I>
 to more accurately reflect the applicability to all aspects of the CRWMS.

 The most likely measurement to be required is a burnup measurement, which may be necessary
to account for burnup credit in the loading of canisters. Such measurements, if required, will be
accomplished by the Purchasers, since they will be responsible for loading the canisters
according to the Certificate of Compliance. Therefore, OCRWM will not be involved in these
measurements and will assume that all regulatory requirements regarding canister loading have
been met when the waste is identified as ready for acceptance. 

In addition, the IAEA may decide to conduct NDA analysis of the individual items prior to their
placement in a sealed canister. This NDA would be conducted by the IAEA to assure that the
SNM contents of the items has not been diverted. Because the material would be classified as
&quot;difficult-to-access,&quot; this assurance would be required at both the gross and partial
defects level. A gross defect in the measured quantity is defined by the IAEA as a 100 percent
difference between the measured amount of material and declared amount, while a partial defect
is defined as a 50 percent difference between the measured and declared amount. If this NDA is
done in advance of loading, dual containment/surveillance of the assemblies while in storage may
be required to ensure that the items are not tampered with. This is not to imply that a decision on
this requirement has been made or that OCRWM believes such measurements are necessary.
However, Purchasers should be aware that the possibility exists that IAEA will determine such
measurements are necessary for purposes of establishing initial inventories of SNM. If such a
determination is made, IAEA will perform the measurements; OCRWM will not be involved
with this procedure.

 OCRWM has been informed by the NRC Office of Arms Control and Non-Proliferation,
International Safeguards Division, that if canisters are sealed prior to IAEA's decision regarding
the implementation of international safeguards within the CRWMS, IAEA will not require such
canisters to be opened for purposes of IAEA verification.

<H3><A NAME="A2"><B>1. MANAGEMENT PLAN</B></A></H3>
<P> The Management Plan should contain a clear and concise overview of the work scope
necessary for completion of Phases B and C. It should describe the project management
organization and explain the allocation of all work between the RSA and all of its subcontractors
with delineating lines of authority, identify all key personnel, identify and describe the facilities
where the work will be performed, and identify all necessary special hardware, materials, and
processes required to perform the work scope and explain how these items will be provided. The
Plan should identify all of the technical support disciplines to be employed with their related
responsibilities including specialty skills required and sources of qualified personnel. The Plan
should contain a description of all administrative support systems and controls that will be used
to manage the execution of the work scope within the milestone schedule including a description
of all management plans and reports that will be used. The Plan should contain a master schedule
and a detailed milestone schedule with key decision points, delivery dates for major deliverables,
planned management and design reviews, presentations, audits, key events and all hold points. It
must include a Monthly Status Report as a deliverable. It should identify all applicable programs
to be used in contract performance, such as Quality Assurance, configuration management,
Purchaser/Federal Facility Operator interface, manufacturing process control, etc. <P>
<H3><A NAME="A3"><B>2. SUBCONTRACT PLAN</B></A></H3>
<P> The Subcontract Plan should identify all subcontractors and describe their respective work
scopes identifying their functional areas of responsibility and services and deliverables to be
supplied, places of performance and schedules of subcontractor activities. The Plan should
require that each subcontractor performing work subject to the controls of the QARD work under
a QA program and a QA plan that cover the subcontractor's specific work scope which have been
reviewed and accepted in writing by the RSA prior to start of work. The Plan should also provide
that the RSA include in its subcontracts provisions for flow down of QA requirements to all
lower-tier subcontractors performing work subject to the controls of the OCRWM QARD;
identification of test and inspection activities and hold/witness points; advance notification of all
hold/witness points; reporting of defects and non-compliance; and access to facilities and records
for verification of QA compliance. 
<P>
<H3><A NAME="A4"><B>3. PURCHASER SITE SERVICE PLANS</B></A></H3> <P>
The Purchaser Site Service Plans shall contain all of the planning information necessary in
sufficient detail to support preparation for and performance of the required waste acceptance and
transportation activities required to meet DOE's commitment under the Purchasers' Disposal
Contracts. The Plans should identify:
<P><DL><DD> - all RSA and Purchaser interface requirements to include transportation
servicing capabilities on-site (truck, rail, barge, heavy haul, etc), <BR><DD> - preliminary
transportation routes to include near-utility-site intermodal transfer sites (if intermodal service is
required),
<BR><DD> - facilities requirements, limitations and constraints related to cask handling and
loading operations,
<BR><DD> - improvements to Purchaser sites which would remove cask handling and loading
limitations and constraints and would result in a lower price, <BR><DD> - types of transport and
transfer casks, ancillary equipment and special tools needed to accept and transport the SNF
off-site, and
<BR><DD> - all on-site services (power, compressed air, etc) required to support the operations.
<P></DL> The Plans should further identify the characteristics of the SNF and other materials
such as non-fuel assembly hardware and channelsto be accepted and transported and discuss the
records and documentation needed to complete the operations. The Plans should contain
schedules for each campaign with all significant milestones and key events, and the critical path
should be identified in each schedule. Finally, the Plans should delineate responsibilities for the
RSA and the Purchasers, e.g. the RSA shall provide the transportation hardware and canisters,
transportation services, training, etc., and the Purchaser will perform the cask handling, loading,
decontamination, preparation for shipment, etc.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="A5"><B>4. REGIONAL SERVICING PLAN</B></A></H3> <P> The
Regional Servicing Plan, for each region, should be a consolidated and integrated plan
incorporating all of the region's Purchaser Site Service Plans and requirements and schedules
therein, describing the regional operations for waste acceptance and transportation, and
describing all of the mobilization and logistics activities required to establish and start up
operations. The Plan should include campaign schedules with the specific details of each
campaign, identification of planned shipping routes and en route intermodal sites to be used,
identify quantities of SNF by type to be accepted and transported by campaign, and identify and
quantify operating fleet requirements for transportation cask systems by type by operating year.
The Plan should identify those transportation services required for each campaign (truck, rail,
barge, intermodal, heavy haul, etc.). The Regional Servicing Plan should contain the routing
information and schedules related to the planned campaigns as attachments that can be readily
removed from the Plan for distribution to authorized state, local and tribal officials. <P> The plan
shall identify all time-phased requirements for transportation and storage related hardware items,
structures, systems and components, to include canisters and storage modules, and all
transportation and intermodal services. Based on the time-phased requirements, the RSA shall
develop the regional operating fleet requirements by year, e.g., how many dual-purpose systems,
transport-only casks, SNF canisters, storage modules, etc., by type and other systems or
components that will be needed to support each year of operation.  <P> The Regional Servicing
Plan shall contain a section that describes the RSA's plans for acquiring all of the resources and
assembling the organizational capabilities required for performance of the Phase B and Phase C
work scope. This section of the Plan shall describe all of the responsible organizations and their
assigned work scope, logistical approach to establishing the operating organization, staffing,
communications, training, development of training, maintenance and operating procedures and
manuals to be delivered under the contract, acquisition of transportation and cask maintenance
services, etc. Additionally, the plan will explain how the resources will be integrated and
assembled and how the operations will be started up.
<P> The plan shall also explain how the RSA will perform its communication and coordination
responsibilities and its participation in quarterly coordination meetings. <P>
<H3><A NAME="A6"><B>5. ACQUISITION PLAN</B></A></H3>
<P> The RSA's Acquisition Plan should identify and describe all significant subcontracting
initiatives planned for the procurement of hardware items, software, and services to meet the
annual Regional Servicing Plan requirements. Additionally, the plan should identify planned
sources of supply, clearly describe contractual relationships between subcontractors and lower
tier subcontractors, indicate the locations where the work will be performed for each subcontract
and lower tier subcontract, and provide estimates of the value of each subcontract, and an
estimate of the relative magnitude of the work effort to be performed under each subcontract and
lower tier subcontract. The plan should incorporate a master schedule reflecting the timing of all
subcontracting initiatives to include key milestones and activities, with all critical path activities
clearly identified.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="A7"><B>6. QUALITY ASSURANCE PLAN</B></A></H3> <P> The
RSA's QA Plan shall identify those activities to be performed by the RSA that are subject to the
controls of OCRWM's QARD, the QA procedures and instructions that will be followed to
control those work activities and the individuals responsible for the performance of the work
being controlled under the QA Program. Secondly, the QA Plan shall identify all subcontractors
and lower tier subcontractors performing work subject to the controls of the QARD for the RSA,
identify the specific work being performed by each subcontractor and lower tier subcontractor,
identify what QA program each of the subcontractors and lower tier subcontractors will be using
to control their work and identify the individuals responsible for the performance of the work
being controlled under the applicable QA Programs.  <P>
<H3><A NAME="A8"><B>7. INSTITUTIONAL PLAN</B></A></H3>
<P> The Institutional Plan developed by the RSA shall describe the type and extent of public
involvement activities to be conducted to facilitate the timely and cost-effective shipment of
spent fuel. These activities shall include: information dissemination to the public, State, local and
Tribal officials, other Federal agencies, and the media; preparation of and technical support for
exhibit materials on RSA operations and transportation; participation in and/or conduct of
meetings, public forums, and training drills and exercises; emergency communications;
operational communications (e.g. routing, prenotification, inspections); and schedules identifying
key milestones and special events.
<P> The Plan should provide for the RSA to coordinate institutional activities with the other
RSAs, as required, for consistency and to avoid dissemination of conflicting or confusing
information; and to establish and maintain communications with the other RSAs, the Federal
Facility Operator and OCRWM for the purpose of ensuring that these organizations are cognizant
of the status of the overall program activities and any problems or issues that may affect their
operations..
<P>
<H3><A NAME="A9"><B>8. ENVIRONMENTAL DATA AND ANALYSES
REPORT</B></A></H3>
<P> This report shall describe the foreseeable direct and indirect environmental impacts resulting
from the implementation of the activities to be conducted under Phases B and C.The activities
shall include the acquisition of required transportation hardware items, structures, and other
systems (such as casks, casks/canisters, and transportable storage casks), and the handling,
transport and storage of spent nuclear fuel. Potential impact areas shall include air quality,
surface and ground water, safety and health, physical and biological resources, waste generation,
noise levels, cultural resources, socioeconomics, and land use. <P> Environmental data provided
in this description shall be limited to information that is reasonably available at theend of Phase

<P><H3><A NAME="A2"><B>H.1 Description of Contract</B></A></H3>


<P>This is a three phase contract to acquire Spent Nuclear Fuel (SNF) waste acceptance and
transportation services on a privatized basis. The Contractor has been selected as having the
requisite technical, business, and financial capability to perform all three phases. Phase A is a
fixed term, firm-fixed price effort to establish the technical, operational, regulatory, financial,
and planning elements required to provide fixed-unit-priced waste acceptance and transportation
services on a privatized basis. Based upon evaluation of the Contractor's deliverables (criteria
TBD), the Contracting Officer will determine whether to authorize the Contractor to proceed to
perform Phase B and to subsequently authorize the Contractor to proceed to perform Phase C.
Phase B work, which would begin approximately 17 months after the award of Phase A, consists
of the design, permitting, institutional outreach to states, tribes, local governments and interested
parties, hardware acquisition, and mobilization necessary to startup waste acceptance and
transportation of SNF operations. Phase C work consists of waste acceptance and transportation
of SNF to a Federal Facility and delivery of storage hardware at fixed unit prices (which include
costs of performing Phase B work) utilizing facilities and equipment that are developed,
financed, permitted, constructed, owned, operated, and deactivated by the Contractor.
<P>


<H3><A NAME="A3"><B>H.2 Obligation of Funds</B></A></H3>


<P><DL><DD> a. The amount of funds obligated to this Contract with respect to the work
covered by Phase A is <U> $ TBD </U>.
<P><DD> b. Phases B and C of this Contract will be incrementally funded. Such funds may be
unilaterally increased by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). 
<P><DL><DD> 1) DOE's obligation to make payment under this Contract is contingent upon
the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for Contract purposes can be legally
made. No legal liability on the part of DOE for any payment, termination liability, or other
contractual requirement may arise from performance under this Contract unless and until funds
are made available and obligated to this Contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such
availability to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer.
<P><DD> 2) DOE will make its best efforts to obligate funds to the Contract after Congressional
authorization and appropriation, and the allotment is received by DOE. DOE intends to obligate
funds to the Contract incrementally as necessary to meet or exceed any annual termination
liability (see Clause H.17, Termination Settlement) and performance payment requirements.
However, nothing in this contract shall be considered to bind or otherwise obligate the Congress
to appropriate funds sufficient to cover contract requirements.
<P><DD> 3) During Phase B, the Contractor shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer in
writing whenever it has reason to believe that the payments due from DOE under this Contract in
the event of a termination for convenience will result in an amount due from DOE which exceeds
the amount obligated under this Contract pursuant to this Clause H.2.
<P><DD> 4) During Phase C, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing
whenever it has reason to believe that the payments due from DOE under this Contract in the
next 60 days, when added to all payments previously made and the amount that would be due in
the event of a termination for convenience, will, in the event of a termination for convenience,
result in an amount to be due from DOE which exceeds the amount obligated under this Contract
pursuant to this Clause H.2. Such notice shall, as a minimum, identify 1)payments made to date;
2)nature and amount of expected payments to the point of exceeding amounts obligated; and
3)payments for the remaining portion of DOE's fiscal year. 
<P><DD> 5) In the event that DOE does not obligate sufficient funds to fulfill its legal
obligations during Phase B and C, the Contractor shall have no further obligation to continue
performance and the continuance of such performance shall be at the Contractor's own risk. DOE
will advise the Contractor, within a reasonable time, of its intentions and expectations regarding
further obligation of funds, provided, however, that a delay in obligating additional funds for
performance of more than 120 days (or such other period as may be mutually agreed upon) will
result in a termination for convenience. 
<P><DD> 6) If, solely by reason of failure of DOE to obligate additional funds in amounts
sufficient for timely performance of the contract, the Contractor incurs additional costs or is
delayed in the performance of the work under this contract and if additional funds are obligated,
an equitable adjustment will be made in the contract prices, or in the time of delivery, or both.
Failure to agree to any such equitable adjustment hereunder will be a dispute within the meaning
of FAR

Section C, <I>Statement of Work</I>, and Section E, <I>Inspection and Acceptance</I>.

Government of any of its rights against Guarantor hereunder. Guarantor agrees that Contractor

or dissolution of Contractor, or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the capital stock,

reorganization, insolvency, debt arrangement or receivership proceedings by or against the
Contractor, or the adjudication of Contractor as bankrupt, or (iii) the assertion by the
Government against Contractor of any of the Government's rights and remedies provided for

<P> Guarantor further agrees that its liability under this Guaranty shall be continuing,
absolute, primary
and direct, and the Government shall not be required to pursue any right or remedy it may have
against Contractor or other Guarantors under the Contract, or any modifications or amendments
thereto, or any other document(s) or instruments(s) executed by Contractor, or otherwise (and
shall not be required to first commence any action or obtain any judgement against Contractor)
before enforcing this Guaranty against Guarantor, and that Guarantor will, upon demand, pay the
Government any amount, the payment of which is guaranteed hereunder and the payment of
which by Contractor is in default under the Contract or under any other documents or instrument
executed by Contractor as aforesaid, and that Guarantor will, upon demand, perform all other
obligation of Contractor, the performance of which by Contractor is guaranteed hereunder.
<P> Guarantor further warrants and represents to the Government that the execution and delivery
of the Guaranty is not in contravention of Guarantor's Articles of Organization, Charter, by-laws
and applicable law; that the execution and delivery of this Guaranty, and the performance
thereof, has been duly authorized by Guarantor's Board of Directors, Trustees, or other
management board, as applicable; and that the execution, delivery, and performance of this

authorized officer, and its corporate seal to be affixed hereto on ______________.

<H3><A NAME="A1"><B>L.1 FAR 52.215-16 Contract Award (OCT 1995)
DEVIATION</B></A></H3>
<P><OL><OL><LI TYPE=A VALUE=1>The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) reserves the
right to make one or more award resulting from this Solicitation to the responsible Offerors
whose Offer(s) conforming to the Solicitation will be most advantageous to the DOE.
<P><LI TYPE=A VALUE=2>DOE may: 1) reject any or all Offers if such action is in the public
interest; 2) accept other than the lowest Offer; and 3) waive informalities and minor irregularities
in Offers received.
<P><LI TYPE=A VALUE=3>DOE may award a Contract on the basis of initial Offers received,
without discussions. Therefore, each initial Offer should contain the Offeror's best terms.
<P><LI TYPE=A VALUE=4>A written award or acceptance of Offer mailed or otherwise
furnished to the successful Offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the Offer shall
result in a binding Contract without further action by either party. Before the Offer's specified
expiration time, DOE may accept an Offer, whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt,
unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. Negotiations conducted after
receipt of an Offer do not constitute a rejection or counter offer by DOE.
<P><LI TYPE=A VALUE=5>If the resulting Contract contains a clause providing for price
reduction for defective cost or pricing data, the Contract price will be subject to reduction if cost
or pricing data furnished are incomplete, inaccurate, or not current.
<P><LI TYPE=A VALUE=6>DOE may determine that an Offer is unacceptable if the prices
proposed are materially unbalanced between line items or sub-line items. An Offer is materially
unbalanced when it is based on prices significantly less than cost for some work and prices which
are significantly overstated in relation to cost for other work, and if there is a reasonable doubt
that the Offer will result in the lowest overall cost to DOE, even though it may be the low
evaluated Offer; or, it is so unbalanced as to be tantamount to allowing an advance payment.
<P><LI TYPE=A VALUE=7>DOE may disclose the following information in post-award
debriefings to Offeror(s):
<P><OL><LI VALUE=1>Overall evaluated price and technical rating of the successful Offeror;
<P><LI VALUE=2>Overall ranking of all Offerors, when any ranking was developed by DOE
during source selection;
<P><LI VALUE=3>Summary of the rationale for award; and
<P><LI VALUE=4>For acquisition of commercial end items, the make and model of the item to
be delivered by the successful Offeror.

<P>The Government contemplates award of firm-fixed price contracts resulting
from this solicitation.

Quotations</B></A></H3>
<P> Unnecessarily elaborate brochures or other presentations beyond those sufficient to present a
complete and effective response to this Solicitation are not desired and may be construed as an
indication of the offeror's or quoter's lack of cost consciousness. Elaborate art work, expensive

<H3><A NAME="A22"><B>L.22 Late Submissions, Modifications, and Withdrawals of
Proposals</B></A></H3>
<P><OL><LI TYPE=A VALUE=1>Any proposal received at the office designated in the
Solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt will not be considered unless it is received
before award is made and it:
<P><OL><LI VALUE=1>Was sent by registered or certified mail not later than the fifth
calendar day before the date specified for receipt of offers (e.g., an offer submitted in response to
a solicitation requiring receipt of offers by the 20th of the month must have been mailed by the
15th);
<P><LI VALUE=2>Was sent by mail or, if authorized by the Solicitation, was sent by telegram
or via facsimile and it is determined by the Government that the late receipt was due solely to
mishandling by the Government after receipt at the Government installation;
<P><LI VALUE=3>Was sent by U.S. Postal Service Express Mail Next Day Service-Post Office
to Addressee, not later than 5:00 p.m. at the place of mailing two working days prior to the date
specified for receipt of proposals. The term &quot;working days&quot; excludes weekends and
U.S. Federal holidays;
<P><LI VALUE=4>Was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the
Solicitation and was received by the Government not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior
to the date specified for receipt of proposals; or
<P><LI VALUE=5>Is the only proposal received.
<P></OL><LI TYPE=A VALUE=2>Any modification of a proposal or quotation, except a
modification resulting from the Contracting Officer's request for &quot;best and final&quot;
offer, is subject to the same conditions as in subparagraphs (a)(1), (2), and (3) of this provision.
<P><LI TYPE=A VALUE=3>A modification resulting from the Contracting Officer's request
for &quot;best and final&quot; offer received after the time and date specified in the request will
not be considered unless received before award and the late receipt is due solely to mishandling
by the Government after receipt at the Government installation.
<P><LI TYPE=A VALUE=4>The only acceptable evidence to establish the date of mailing of a
late proposal or modification sent either by U.S. Postal Service registered or certified mail is the
U.S. or Canadian Postal Service postmark both on the envelope or wrapper and on the original
receipt from the U.S. or Canadian Postal Service. Both postmarks must show a legible date or the
proposal, quotation, or modification shall be processed as if mailed late. &quot;Postmark&quot;
means a printed, stamped, or otherwise placed impression (exclusive of a postage meter machine
impression) that is readily identifiable without further action as having been supplied and affixed
by employees of the U.S. or Canadian Postal Service on the date of mailing. Therefore, offerors
or quoters should request the postal clerk to place a legible hand cancellation bull's eye postmark
on both the receipt and the envelope or wrapper.
<P><LI TYPE=A VALUE=5>The only acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the
Government installation is the time/date stamp of that installation on the proposal wrapper or
other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation.
<P><LI TYPE=A VALUE=6>The only acceptable evidence to establish the date of mailing of a
late offer, modification, or withdrawal sent by Express Mail Next Day Service-Post Office to
Addressee is the date entered by the post office receiving clerk on the &quot;Express Mail Next
day Service-Post Office to Addressee&quot; label and the postmark on both the envelope or
wrapper and on the original receipt from the U.S. Postal Service. &quot;Postmark&quot; has the
same meaning as defined in paragraph (d) of this provision, excluding postmarks of the Canadian
Postal Service. Therefore, offerors or quoters should request the postal clerk to place a legible
hand cancellation bull's eye postmark on both the receipt and the envelope or wrapper.
<P><LI TYPE=A VALUE=7>Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this provision, a late
modification of an otherwise successful proposal that makes its terms more favorable to the
Government will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.
<P><LI TYPE=A VALUE=8>Proposals may be withdrawn by written notice or telegram
(including mailgram) received at any time before award. If the Solicitation authorizes facsimile
proposals, proposals may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before award, subject
to the conditions specified in the provision entitled &quot;Facsimile Proposals&quot;. Proposals
may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or an authorized representative, if the representative's
identity is made known and the representative signs a receipt for the proposal before award.
<P><LI TYPE=I VALUE=1>If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal
Government processes so that technical proposals cannot be received at the office designated for
receipt of technical proposals by the exact time specified in the Solicitation, and urgent
Government requirements preclude amendment of the Solicitation or other notice of an extension
of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of technical proposals will be deemed to be
extended to the same time of day specified in the Solicitation on the first work day on which
normal Government processes resume. If no time is specified in the Solicitation, the time for
receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office.

<P> The Section of this Solicitation which describes the work to be performed also sets forth
DOE's known requirements for technical data. The <I>Additional Technical Data
Requirements</I> Clause, if included in this Solicitation, provides DOE with the option to order
additional technical data, the requirements for which are not known at the time of contracting.
There is, however, a built-in limitation on the kind of technical data that may be required. This
limitation provides that the Contractor may withhold delivery of proprietary data. Accordingly, it
is necessary that the Offeror's proposal state that the work to be performed and the known
requirements for technical data as set forth in the Solicitation have been reviewed, and either
state that, to the best of its knowledge, no data will be withheld, or submit a list identifying the
proprietary data which, to the best of its knowledge, will likely be used in the Contract
performance and will be withheld.

<html><hr><head><h2>OCRWM Receives Half Its Fiscal Year 1996 Budget Request</h2></head>
<p><hr>
  <body><h4>The Energy and Water Development Appropriation Act of 1996 was signed into law on November 13, 1995, providing a total of $400 million for the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management (OCRWM). Of this $400 million, $85 million has been reserved for interim storage and may be used only upon enactment of new statutory authority.  Lacking such authority, the program's fiscal year (FY) 1996 funding is limited to $315 million, half the amount requested last spring by the Administration.
  <p>
The table below outlines the breakdown of funds as follows: the FY 1995 appropriation, the FY 1996 Administration request, and the FY 1996 appropriation.
</h4> <p>

 <pre><h3> <b>                                         OCRWM Budget

															   (400)  
</pre>
<p><h4>
As shown in the table, the result of the Congress' budget action is a 50-percent reduction from the FY 1996 request for the program, and a 40-percent reduction from the FY 1995 appropriation expenditure. Based on Congressional guidance,
  OCRWM has allocated $250 million to Yucca Mountain for site characterization activities. At this appropriation funding,
  continuation of the Program Approach adopted in FY 1994 is no longer feasible. The Congress recognized that situation,
  and the Conference Report accompanying the FY 1996 Appropriations Bill provides the following guidance: 
  <p>
"The conferees agree on the importance of continuing the existing scientific work at Yucca Mountain to determine the ultimate feasibility and licensability of the permanent repository at that site. The conferees direct the Department to refocus the repository program on completing the core scientific activities at Yucca Mountain. The Department should complete excavation of the necessary portions of the exploratory tunnel and the scientific tests needed to assess the performance of the repository. It should defer preparation and filing of a license application for the repository with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission until a later date. The Department's goal should be to collect the scientific information needed to determine the suitability of the Yucca Mountain site and to complete a conceptual design for the repository and waste package for later
submission to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission." 
  <p>
OCRWM has defined a new milestone for the Yucca Mountain Project in the form of specific work products that will contribute to a "viability assessment," which will be completed in 1998. This viability assessment is not the same as the technical site suitability evaluation contemplated in the previous Program Approach. 
  <p>
The viability assessment is intended to clarify the most uncertain aspects of geologic disposal at Yucca Mountain. The components of the assessment will make important contributions toward the development of a Secretarial recommendation to the President and preparation of a license application to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), but they will not be sufficient for either of these formal actions.</h4>
  <p>
 <h4><i>Impacts on the OCRWM Program</i></h4>
  <p>
  <h4>The $315 million budget cannot support the following activities: the 1998 target date for the Department to issue
  the Yucca Mountain Technical Site Suitability evaluation; the 2001 target date for a repository license application to
  the NRC; and the 2010 target date for the initial emplacement of spent nuclear fuel in the geologic repository. 
  <p>
  In addition, as a result of budget reductions, the multi-purpose canister (MPC) development program will end
  with the completion of the MPC safety analysis report design (see related article in this issue), and waste acceptance
  activities  will be curtailed to minimum  legal requirements. 
 <p><hr>
 <h3><strong>Yucca Mountain - Planned Activities for FY 1996</strong></h3>
 <h4> Site characterization activities planned for FY 1996 include the following:
<ul>
<li>Complete numerical models of the natural barriers (geology, hydrology, and geochemistry) to support the Total
  System Performance Assessment
 <li>Conduct hydrological testing of the repository rocks and faults in alcoves in the Exploratory Studies Facility 
<li>Monitor the unsaturated zone along the Exploratory Studies Facility main drift
<li>Conduct testing of the saturated zone (ground water)
<li>Continue monitoring of transient events, such as earthquakes and rainfall, at a reduced rate
<li>Issue seismic Topical Report II
<li>Complete excavation of the tunnel's thermal testing alcove
<li>Begin <i>in situ</i> thermal test planning
<li>Provide input to Environmental Protection Agency rule making on the radiation release standard
<li>Develop contingency planning for permanent storage.
</ul></h4>
  <p><hr>
  <h3><strong>Waste Acceptance, Storage, and Transportation -   Planned Activities for FY 1996</strong></h3>
  <h4>Activities related to Waste Acceptance, Storage, and Transportation planned for FY 1996 include the following:
<ul>
<li>Submit the Topical Safety Analysis Report to the NRC on the design of the Dry Transfer system, which had been
 developed under a cooperative agreement with Edison Electric Institute
<li>Continue cooperative agreements between the program and external organizations at one-third of their FY 1995 budgets
<li>Develop and issue Section 180(c) Proposed Notice of Policy and Procedures
<li>Perform integrated safeguards and security requirements analysis
<li>Develop spent nuclear fuel verification requirements for utilities
<li>Develop waste acceptance and transportation concept of operations plan
<li>Continue contingency planning for storage, transportation, and operations.
<p>

<html><hr><head><h2> Congressional Budget Action Halts Multi-Purpose Canister
  Development</h2></head>
<p><hr>
    <body><h4> 
  As a result of Congressional budget action for fiscal year
  1996, the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management
  (OCRWM) has altered its plans concerning development and
  deployment of a multi-purpose canister (MPC)-based system.
  <p>
  OCRWM had established a three-phase procurement strategy for
  the MPC and begun work on an environmental impact statement
  (EIS). The first phase includes a detailed design of the MPC
  and supporting systems and the preparation of safety
  analysis reports for submittal to the Nuclear Regulatory
  Commission (NRC) for review and approval. OCRWM and the
  awardee, Westinghouse Electric Corporation, are working to
  complete the first phase by the end of April 1996. The
  second phase was intended to lead to NRC certification of
  the MPC-based system for storage and transportation. The
  third phase included procurement of the first MPCs and
  supporting components. With funds needed to complete phases
  two and three unavailable, OCRWM had to cease development of
  the technology beyond phase one.
  <p>
<img align=middle src="mpc.gif"><br>
<i>Plans to develop this proposed Multi-Purpose Canister-based system have been altered.</i>
<p>
  The idea of a universal system that could address spent fuel
  storage, transportation, and disposal was conceived by
  private industry, and several key organizations had
  previously encouraged the Department to develop the concept
  further. The NRC expressed concerns about functional
  compatibility as early as 1988 and codified these concerns
  in a 1990 rule that states, "To the extent practicable in
  the design of storage casks, consideration should be given
  to compatibility with removal of the stored spent fuel from
  a reactor site, transportation, and ultimate disposition by
  the Department of Energy."
  <p>
  OCRWM initiated development of the MPC system in response to
  these calls for standardization and compatibility among
  utilities' and the Federal Government's waste management
  systems. The MPC concept under development by OCRWM would
  have accommodated some 80 percent of all spent nuclear fuel
  to be discharged by the Nation's light-water reactors, and
  would have utilized a sealed canister for storage,
  transportation, and disposal. OCRWM personnel developed a
  schedule, in consultation with NRC staff, that would have
  enabled the first MPCs to be available in the fall of 1998.
  <p>
  A number of analyses were conducted to better identify and
  quantify the costs and benefits of implementing such an
  integrated-systems approach to spent nuclear fuel
  management. Obvious benefits included a large reduction in
  the number of spent nuclear fuel assembly handlings and a
  reduction in the number and cost of interfaces among
  utilities' and OCRWM's waste management systems.
  <p>
  OCRWM had insisted from the start that any decision to
  develop MPCs be grounded on, among other things, a
  broad-based support for doing so. To that end, OCRWM held
  two early-stage workshops to discuss preliminary
  considerations. The workshops were well attended by a broad
  spectrum of stakeholders, including prospective bidders on
  the MPC contract. Utility representatives, along with
  members of several environmental organizations, also
  contributed to OCRWM's decision to move forward with the MPC
  concept. Three MPC EIS scoping meetings followed in late
  1994. Feedback from the workshops and scoping meetings was
  positive.
  <p>
  As a result of strong encouragement of OCRWM's concept of an
  MPC-based system from the NRC, the Nuclear Waste Technical
  Review Board, the utility industry, and virtually all
  stakeholder groups, OCRWM revised its design of and
  operating scenario for the waste management system based on
  the MPC. In order to support OCRWM's efforts to develop an
  MPC system that would accommodate such a broad spectrum of
  spent nuclear fuel, the NRC established its Spent Fuel
  Project Office.
  <p>
  In light of Congressional action, OCRWM recently suspended
  all work on the Environmental Impact Statement for a
  Multi-Purpose Canister System for Management of Civilian and
  Naval Spent Nuclear Fuel. In this EIS, OCRWM was evaluating
  the environmental impacts of fabricating and deploying a
  standardized container system for the storage,
  transportation, and possible disposal of civilian and
  defense spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste.
  OCRWM had been working jointly with the Department of the
  Navy on the EIS after the Department of Energy determined
  that naval spent fuel should be addressed in the EIS, since
  the Navy recognized the benefits of the MPC for storage,
  transport, and disposal of its spent fuel.
  <p>
  The Navy now has decided that it will proceed with the part
  of the MPC EIS covering naval spent nuclear fuel and, on
  December 7, 1995, published a Notice in the <i>Federal Register</i>
  stating that it would assume lead responsibility for the
  EIS. The Department of Energy's role will be limited to that
  of a cooperating agency in the preparation of the report.
  The Navy plans to issue the Draft EIS by April 30, 1996.
  Following issuance of the Draft, which will be announced in
  the <i>Federal Register</i>, a 45-day comment period will be
  provided. During the comment period, public hearings will be
  held. The locations and dates of these public hearings will
  be announced in the <i>Federal Register</i> when the Draft EIS is
  issued. The Navy plans to issue the final EIS by November
  30, 1996, and a Record of Decision by December 31, 1996.
  <p>
  OCRWM continues to believe that the idea of an integrated
  systems approach to spent nuclear fuel management that would
  address all three functions storage, transportation, and
  disposal and accommodate the vast majority of spent fuel
  designs, is a good one one that would produce benefits for
  utilities and the Federal Government. To that end, OCRWM is
  encouraging the private sector to work toward developing
  such an integrated systems approach.

<html><hr><head><h2>Secretary of Energy Testifies Before Congress <br>on Senate Bill
  S. 1271</h2></head>
<p><hr>
    <body><h4>
  Secretary of Energy Hazel R. O'Leary appeared before the
  Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee on December
  14, 1995, to testify that the Administration would not
  support Senate Bill S. 1271, which, among other provisions,
  directs siting of an interim storage facility in Nevada. 
  <p>
  The bill's provisions mandate expediting the construction of
  an interim storage facility for commercial spent nuclear
  fuel, beginning operations in phases by January 1998. The
  facility would be constructed at the Nevada test site in
  area 25, which is located near the Yucca Mountain site.
  Secretary O'Leary stated that the Administration is
  concerned that the siting of an interim storage facility in
  Nevada, and at an unreasonably rapid pace, would force the
  Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management (OCRWM)
  program into excessively curtailed regulatory processes and
  unreasonable and logistically untenable deadlines. Secretary
  O'Leary pointed out that the national policy, expressed in
  existing law, is that Nevada should be excluded from
  consideration as an interim storage site. "The selection of
  any site for an interim storage facility," she said,
  "deserves to be based upon objective analysis using
  substantive criteria...the relative merits of selecting
  Nevada as an interim storage site would certainly be
  influenced by the probability that the repository will also
  go forward. That probability cannot be evaluated at this
  time." 
 <p>
<img align=middle src="hazel.gif"> <br>
<i>Secretary of Energy Hazel R. O'Leary</i>
<p>
  Secretary O'Leary expressed concern that the approach
  adopted in the proposed bill for resolving the interim
  storage need is likely to raise new issues for equally
  important aspects of the national nuclear waste system. "The
  bill as drafted," stated Secretary O'Leary, "assigns
  priority to an immediate initiative on interim storage with
  a highly accelerated schedule. This requirement coupled with
  the probable budget constraints would place the repository
  program in jeopardy and reduce the policy commitment to the
  long-term strategy of geologic disposal." She stated that
  geologic disposal is the end-point of the Federal
  radioactive waste management system, and that a decision to
  significantly defer or abandon it would have the effect of
  making at-reactor or interim storage of commercial spent
  nuclear fuel the open-ended, long-term strategy. "Unless the
  importance of geologic disposal is reflected in the
  articulation of public policy and in the funding of the
  program," testified Secretary O'Leary, "we will need to
  rethink our options for the long-term custody of all
  high-level nuclear waste."
 <p> 
  S. 1271 provides for the continuation of site
  characterization activities at Yucca Mountain and for the
  licensing and development of a repository if the site is
  found suitable. In the event of constrained funding,
  however, the licensing, construction, and operation of the
  repository are designated to have a lower priority than the
  interim storage facility and its associated transportation
  system. "Because the measure does not change the budgetary
  treatment of the Nuclear Waste Fund collections," stated
  Secretary O'Leary, " it seems likely that the funding for
  the repository determination will be constrained as the
  requirements of an interim storage initiative increase." 
  <p>
  In discussing her proposed course of action, Secretary
  O'Leary stated that the Administration continues to believe
  that completion of the scientific studies at Yucca Mountain
  is the most sensible and principled course of action. "If
  Yucca Mountain is found suitable and meets the test of 
  licensing," commented Secretary O'Leary, "provision could
  have been made to take waste at the site in a receiving
  facility as early as 2004. The fiscal year 1996 budget
  submitted by the Administration would have supported this
  approach. However, funding constraints imposed by the fiscal
  year 1996 appropriations appear to have foreclosed this
  schedule." 
  <p>
  Faced with current realities, Secretary O'Leary proposed
  five principles to be adopted into legislation that would
  maintain momentum  toward permanent disposal, address the
  interim storage issue, and recognize the realities of the
  budget outlook. These five principles are: 
  <p>
<ul>
<li>Providing adequate funding to resolve the major remaining technical uncertainties at Yucca Mountain
<li>Revising the repository regulatory structure to reflect current circumstances
<li>Selecting any interim storage site based on objective criteria
<li>Initiating generic interim storage activities
<li>Protecting the environment and assuring public and worker health and safety.
</ul><p>
  Secretary O'Leary concluded her testimony by noting the past
  year's accomplishments made by OCRWM, including the adoption
  of a new program approach and the measurable progress that
  was made toward geologic disposal at the Yucca Mountain
  site.

<p><hr>
    <body><h4> 
  People from 30 countries on six continents have traveled
  thousands of miles to visit the OCRWM Home Page on the World
  Wide Web. They scale mountains, swim oceans, track through
  snow, and traverse severe weather conditions without ever
  leaving their desks. They arrive in a matter of seconds and
  stay as long as they like for a cost of only pennies. They
  obtain information about the U.S. Civilian Radioactive Waste
  Management program. They request videotapes and
  publications. They receive answers to questions and offer
  their opinions. And, even though the "Blizzard of  '96"
  paralyzed the east coast for a week in January, they visited
  Washington, D.C., easily. Though weather shut down the
  Nation's capital, the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste
  Management (OCRWM) and other Federal programs remained open
  to the public -- virtually.
  <p>
  Technology is moving quickly and electronic communications
  are providing government, industry, and educational
  institutions with an environmentally friendly way to reach
  more people in more locations in less time while trimming
  costs. 
  <p>
  "Growing numbers of people are online whether it's at home
  or at work. And the Information Superhighway is the reason
  for this global phenomenon because it delivers timely,
  cost-effective, interesting, and relevant information," said
  Harold Brandt, Director of OCRWM's Administration Division
  and the person responsible for OCRWM's public information
  activities.
 <p> 
  "Since its debut on the Information Superhighway nearly 1
  year ago, the OCRWM Home Page has been accessed over 250,000
  times by users in the public, commercial, and governmental
  domains. It now averages more than 10,000 accesses per week,
  significantly enhancing OCRWM's ability to relay
  program-specific information to stakeholders and the public
  at large," Brandt explained. "Especially in light of recent
  budget reductions and the resulting need to cut back on
  other information products and services, OCRWM plans to rely
  increasingly on its Home Page for external communications."
  <p>
  Among the activities that had to be scaled back or
  eliminated was the<i> OCRWM Bulletin</i>, which will be published
  semiannually instead of quarterly during fiscal year 1996.
  However, you can visit the OCRWM Home Page, which is updated
  continuously, to learn about activities under way and recent
  developments in the OCRWM program. In addition, users can
  read announcements, <i>Federal Register</i> notices, reports,
  testimony, speeches, and meeting news. A new
  product-ordering system enables publications and videotapes
  to be ordered easily. In addition, direct access is provided
  to a host of other information services available via the
  Internet, including the National Academy of Sciences, the
  Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Federal Register, and the
  Library of Congress home pages.
  <p>
  Recently, the OCRWM Home Page was rated among the top 5
  percent of all sites on the World Wide Web by a subsidiary
  of Lycos, one of the largest and most prestigious search
  engines on the Internet. Point Communications reviews sites
  on the World Wide Web to provide "surfers" with a standard

<html><hr><head><h2>OCRWM HBCU Scholarship Recipients Selected</h2></head>
<p><hr>
  <body><h4>
This past fall, 10 scholars were selected from a pool of more
than 120 applicants to receive scholarships through the
Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) Undergraduate
Scholarship Program, sponsored by the Office of Civilian
Radioactive Waste Management (OCRWM). The 10 recipients, all
students attending historically black colleges or universities 
located throughout the United States, were chosen by a panel
comprised of representatives from historically black colleges and
universities and experts in civilian radioactive waste management
from Department of Energy's  national laboratories, academia, and
private industry.
<p>
The HBCU Undergraduate Scholarship Program is designed to
encourage students to consider a career in high-level radioactive
waste management by providing support to academically superior
juniors and seniors pursuing degrees in related fields at
historically black colleges and universities. It is hoped that
undergraduate scholars may, in the future, participate in OCRWM's
Radioactive Waste Management Graduate Fellowship Program, thereby
increasing the diversity of OCRWM's future workforce.
<p>
The scholarship award includes payment of tuition and fees and a
monthly stipend, as well as a summer internship assignment at a
Department of Energy site, where students perform work supporting
the OCRWM program. Scholarship recipients also participate in an
orientation workshop in Las Vegas, Nevada, the first of which was
held in September 1995. The workshop included meetings with staff
from the Yucca Mountain Site Characterization Office and the
United States Geological Survey, an overview of the Yucca
Mountain Project at the Yucca Mountain Science Center, and an
all-day tour of the Yucca Mountain site.

<html><hr><head><h2>OCRWM Participates in League of Women Voters Panel Discussion</h2></head>
<p><hr>
  <body><h4>
  This past December, Linda Desell, Director of the
  Environmental and Operational Activities Division of the
  Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management (OCRWM),
  participated in a panel discussion on the topic of
  radioactive waste. The symposium, which took place at
  Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut, was
  sponsored by the Greater Middletown League of Women Voters.
  In addition to Ms. Desell, who represented OCRWM at the
  symposium, panel participants included Marvin Resnikoff of
  Radioactive Waste Management Associates; Susan Wiltshere of
  J.K. Research Associates; and Professor Jelle de Boer of
  Wesleyan University's Environmental Sciences Department. The
  audience included the general public and members of the
  local League organization.
  <p>
  The panel spent the first half of the symposium defining the
  existing nuclear waste problem and discussing possible
  solutions to that problem. The second half of the discussion
  related to regulatory framework and policy issues, including
  the U.S. policy on high-level radioactive waste disposal and
  the currently "favored" solution to the waste-disposal
  problem (i.e., geologic disposal, as mandated by Congress).
  <p>
  The symposium concluded with a discussion on what citizens
  can do to become better educated and more informed of the
  problems related to the management and disposal of
  radioactive waste, and how they  can provide meaningful
  input in terms of helping to select the "best" solution to
  these problems.

  <body><h4>
  The eighth semiannual meeting of the Transportation External
  Coordination Working Group (TEC/WG) was held January 16-18,
  1996, in San Antonio, Texas. TEC/WG, a partnership between
  the Department of Energy (DOE) and its stakeholder
  organizations, works to identify and resolve significant
  issues related to DOE's transportation of radioactive
  hazardous materials. TEC/WG's members -- all of whom share an
  interest in the Department's transportation-related
  activities --  include personnel from various DOE program and
  project offices; national and regional organizations
  representing State, Tribal, and local governments;
  professional associations; and industry organizations.
  <p>
  In a series of plenary sessions, the group received updates
  on current activities within the Department. Representatives
  of the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management and
  the Office of Environmental Management (EM) provided an
  overview of current activities within each office.
  Representatives from EM's Spent Nuclear Fuel Program, the
  Waste Isolation Pilot Plant, and EM's Coordinated Research
  Program provided updates on transportation-related
  activities within these programs. Representatives of the
  University of New Mexico shared findings from the study,
  "Transporting Radioactive Materials: Risks, Issues, and
  Public Perspectives," with the group. TEC/WG members
  representing the Council of State Governments Midwestern
  Office, the Council of State Governments/Eastern Regional
  Conference, and the Nuclear Energy Institute participated in
  a panel to share their perspectives with other members of
  TEC/WG and DOE.
  <p>
  Participants discussed specific issues in greater detail
  during a series of four breakout sessions. Two breakout
  sessions were devoted to topics within General Planning and

<html><body><h4>1.     INTRODUCTION</h4>
<p>
<h4>1.1  OBJECTIVE</h4>
<p>
The objective of this procurement is to contract with private industry for the provision of waste 
acceptance, transportation, and delivery services, and storage equipment for commercial spent
nuclear fuel.  Provision of these services and equipment will enable the Office of Civilian
Radioactive Waste Management (OCRWM) of the Department of Energy (DOE) to meet its
obligations as defined in the Nuclear Waste Policy Act as amended.  These services and
equipment will be procured by awarding up to four contracts with each contract covering the
Purchasers' <a href="foot.htm">[1]</a> sites in one or two of the four designated regions identified in Figure 1.1 in the
continental United States; more detailed figures of the regions are provided in <a href="appa.htm">Appendix A</a>.  Each
contractor (hereafter called a "Regional Servicing Agent") shall be responsible for all activities
and services in its region, including the provision of transportation and storage casks, canisters,
storage modules, and ancillary equipment, as required to accept the spent nuclear fuel and
transport it to a designated Federal Facility for storage or disposal.
<p>
<h4>1.2  PROGRAM SUMMARY</h4>
    <p> 
OCRWM is responsible for implementing the provisions of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act
(NWPA), as amended.  The NWPA requires, among other things, that the Department provide
for waste acceptance, transportation, and disposal of spent nuclear fuel (SNF) or high-level
radioactive waste from Purchasers who have entered into Purchaser disposal contract(s)<a href="foot.htm">[2]</a> with the
Secretary of Energy for such services.
<p>
Consistent with the NWPA, the Department plans to "... utilize ... private industry to the fullest
extent possible..." for the performance of transportation activities as authorized by Congress.  To
this extent, OCRWM is pursuing an acquisition process that is market driven, that is, OCRWM
will rely on private industry to provide all of the necessary services and hardware items required
to fulfill OCRWM's waste acceptance and transportation mission at competitive prices.  The                               
intent is to develop a market infrastructure to foster competition and innovative approaches to
waste acceptance and transportation services and to produce results at a best value for the
Civilian Radioactive Waste Management Program.
<p><pre><h4>									Figure 1.1</h4>

<h4>1.3  WORK SCOPE SUMMARY</h4>
<p>
To achieve the intended objectives and to provide capability to respond to contingencies,
OCRWM's waste acceptance and transportation operations have been divided into four regions
(Figure 1.1).  A successful Offeror will be awarded a contract and shall become the Regional
Servicing Agent (RSA) for a designated region and be responsible for performing all planning,
preparations, waste acceptance, transportation and delivery of Purchaser SNF from that region to
a Federal Facility at the rates and from the locations specified in the Regional Waste Acceptance
Schedule <a href="appb.htm">(Appendix B)</a> for that region.  The related work scope for the contracts has been phased
to facilitate contract definition and performance.  The phases are: Phase A - Development of
Servicing Plans; Phase B - Acquisition of Hardware Items and Mobilization; and Phase C - SNF
Acceptance and Transport.  Refer to <a href="4tasks.htm">Section 4.0</a> for detailed requirements.
  <p>        
<h4>1.4  REGIONAL SERVICING AGENT CONCEPT OF OPERATIONS</h4>
<p>
The Concept of Operations which follows summarizes the major operational activities to be
performed by the RSA.  The description begins with preparation for waste acceptance and
continues through delivery of SNF to a Federal Facility.  Although the RSA is responsible for
providing all necessary hardware items, acquisition of hardware items is not included in the
following description of the Concept of Operations.
<p>
<strong> <a name="1.4.1">    1.4.1 </a>    Activities at Purchasers' Sites </strong>
<p>
     The RSA shall provide NRC certified transportation systems suitable for use at 
     Purchasers' facilities for loading of SNF for shipment to the Federal Facility. 
     Transportation systems could include dual-purpose (transport/storage) casks and canister-based transport/storage systems (both hereafter referred to as "dual-purpose systems") and
     transport-only casks for uncanistered SNF.  The first two years of SNF deliveries to the
     Federal Facility will only be in dual-purpose systems.  Thereafter, deliveries may be made
     in either dual-purpose systems or uncanistered SNF transport cask systems compatible
     with the Federal Facility's ability to handle either type of system. 
<p>
     The RSA shall ensure that all SNF designated for loading is in compliance with the
     requirements contained in the SNF Verification Plan  <a href="appc.htm">(Appendix C)</a>.  All necessary
     ancillary cask-handling equipment shall be provided to the Purchaser's site by the RSA. 
     While at the Purchaser's facility, the Purchaser will be responsible for incidental
     maintenance, protection, and preservation of all equipment furnished to the Purchaser by
     the RSA for the loading and shipment of SNF.  Appropriate documentation shall be
     provided by the RSA to the Purchasers to demonstrate equipment compliance with NRC
     regulations.  The RSA shall provide cask-handling training to personnel at sites to be
     serviced.  The casks will be loaded and prepared for off site shipment by the Purchasers
     in accordance with Purchaser's Quality Assurance (QA) procedures and the requirements
     of the NRC Certificate of Compliance.  
     <p>
     The RSA shall conduct, or be responsible for, all shipping arrangements, including the
     provision of appropriate transport carrier services, on-site/near-site intermodal transfer
     services,  advance notifications, in-transit physical protection/escort services, and
     payment of any State-imposed tolls and fees.  The RSA shall determine the transportation
     routes in accordance with the regulatory requirements of the Department of
     Transportation and the NRC and provide descriptions of these routes to the NRC for
     approval.  The RSA shall provide OCRWM information copies of all transportation route
     descriptions prior to their submission to the NRC.  Also, the RSA shall interact with State
     and Tribal governments as necessary to support development and final selection of the
     shipping routes.  The RSA shall accept title to the SNF on behalf of OCRWM and be the
     Shipping Agent for OCRWM.
<p>
   <strong>  1.4.2  Activities During Transport</strong>
<p>
     The RSA shall provide for: in-transit physical protection; continuous tracking of each in-transit shipment; capability to communicate with escorts accompanying in-transit
     shipments and carriers while the SNF is in transit; and any required en route intermodal
     transfer services.  The RSA shall be responsible for payment of all costs related to
     correcting any non-compliance deficiencies and any transportation non-compliance costs,
     including any Federal, State, and Tribal fines or penalties.
<p>
     The RSA shall provide notifications to NRC, OCRWM, the Purchaser, and State and
     Tribal governments in the event of an emergency.  Emergency response will be provided
     by local units of government, States, Tribes, or through appropriate Federal agencies,
     such as the Federal Emergency Management Agency, if requested by the State or Tribal
     governments.   The RSA may be requested to provide assistance to the officials in charge
     at the scene of an emergency or accident related to its SNF shipments.  
<p>
     As necessary, the RSA shall provide heavy-haul capability en route to the Federal Facility
     should the Facility not be serviced by a railroad.  The RSA shall interface with the
     Federal Facility Operator to ensure that shipments are coordinated with other shipments
     from other regions.  Delay or postponement of shipments shall be communicated to NRC,
     OCRWM, Federal Facility Operator, States and Tribal units of government. 
 <p>
     <strong>1.4.3     Activities at Designated Federal Facility</strong>
<p>
     The RSA shall be responsible for providing the Operator of the Federal Facility with the
     appropriate storage systems for the SNF being delivered, if required.  Depending on
     storage needs, this will necessitate the provision of either storage modules for canistered
     SNF or single-purpose canisters and storage modules for uncanistered SNF.  Also, all
     required cask-handling or canister-handling ancillary hardware items, such as lifting
     yokes and transfer casks, shall be provided to the Federal Facility Operator by the RSA. 
     The RSA shall be responsible for taking appropriate action to correct non-compliance
     with NRC regulations for any shipment as notified by the  Federal Facility Operator.
<p>
    <strong> 1.4.4     At Regional Servicing Agent Site</strong>
<p>
     The RSA shall prepare and maintain Purchaser Site Service Plans and an integrated
     Regional Service Plan; shall coordinate as required with the Federal Facility Operator and
     other RSAs; and shall arrange for all required services and delivery of all required
     hardware items to Purchasers and the Federal Facility Operator.  The servicing plans shall
     be compatible with the operating capabilities of the Federal Facility and shall reflect the
     Purchasers' and RSA's capabilities to use dual-purpose systems.  The RSA shall prepare
     a QA program, a QA Plan, operating and QA procedures, training materials, conduct
     training of RSA's staff,  and provide QA support for RSA's activities and OCRWM QA
     audit and surveillance activities.
<p>
     The RSA shall be responsible for all cask maintenance, repairs, cleaning, and cask
     reconfigurations.  Such activities shall be conducted at RSA identified facility(ies) as
     required to support RSA's operations.  The RSA shall also be responsible for disposal of
     any waste generated during such maintenance.
<p>
<h4>1.5  QUALITY ASSURANCE REQUIREMENTS</h4>
<p>
OCRWM nuclear activities are subject to  NRC regulations for Quality Assurance (QA).  These
QA regulations and related controls have been implemented throughout OCRWM in the Quality
Assurance Requirements and Description (QARD).  OCRWM procured items and services
subject to NRC regulation that could affect the health and safety of the public must comply with
and be controlled under the applicable provisions of the QARD.  Therefore, OCRWM
contractors performing work on contracts and delivering items and/or services subject to the
controls of the QARD must perform the work in compliance with the provisions of the QARD
and an OCRWM approved QA Program.  The applicability of the specific provisions of the
QARD to the contractor and each of its subcontractors' work is dependent upon the nature of the
work scope and the apportionment of the work scope among the contractor and its subcontractors
and the contractual arrangements between the participants.  The applicable requirements of the
QARD flow from OCRWM to the contractor, who in turn must flow down those specific
applicable QARD requirements to its subcontractors in its subcontracts based on assigned work
scope to the individual subcontractors.

<html><body><h4>2.   SCOPE
<p>
2.1  STRUCTURE OF WORK SCOPE AND PHASING</h4>
<p>
The RSA work scope is structured to represent the logical and chronological occurrence of the
distinct work activities.  The work segments are called phases, and include:  Phase A -
Development of Servicing Plans, Phase B -  Acquisition of Hardware Items and Mobilization,
and Phase C - SNF Acceptance and Transport.  The purpose of the nine month Phase A Planning
work scope is to obtain comprehensive plans and revised pricing for the work scope defined in
both Phase B and Phase C from each contractor awarded a Phase A Regional Servicing Contract. 
For an RSA selected to participate in Phase B and Phase C,  the initial three year work scope
involves the total effort of marshaling the required hardware items, software, facilities and
personnel and preparing to startup waste acceptance and transportation operations plus the
following five years of management and acquisition of required hardware.  Phase C, commencing
about three years after start of Phase B,  is the five years of waste acceptance and transportation
operations.
<p>
<h4>2.2  PHASE A:  DEVELOPMENT OF SERVICING PLANS</h4>
<p>
During Phase A, the RSA shall contact each Purchaser with an allocation within its  region and
develop Purchaser approved Purchaser Site Service Plans; prepare an integrated Regional
Servicing Plan; determine required quantities of transportation and storage components;
determine software, personnel, services, and facilities requirements; prepare a management plan
for Phase B and Phase C work scope; and prepare revised pricing for Phase B and Phase C work
scope based on the plans and requirements estimates.  The Phase A plans, requirements
development, and revised pricing shall be based on the Regional Waste Acceptance Schedule
<a href="appb.htm">(Appendix B)</a>.  This is the starting point from which the RSA shall initiate discussions and
planning with the Purchasers in its region.  The RSA shall deliver the specified quantities of
Purchasers' SNF from the region to the Federal Facility.
<p>
The RSA may propose in its Purchaser Site Service Plans and Regional Servicing Plan any
reasonable approaches agreeable to the affected Purchasers.  However, OCRWM will not fund
any on-site infrastructure modifications or improvements to the Purchasers' facilities. 
<p>
<h4>2.3  PHASE B:  ACQUISITION OF HARDWARE ITEMS AND MOBILIZATION </h4>
<p>
Phase B is anticipated to last approximately eight years; the first three years of this phase will
cover pre-operational activities and hardware  acquisition, and the last five years will cover
management, and continuing transportation cask and storage system hardware acquisition needed
to support the SNF delivery rates during the Phase C waste acceptance and transportation
operations. 
<p>
OCRWM will only accept delivery and take title to SNF canisters, storage modules, and that
ancillary equipment required for handling of casks and canisters and support of Federal Facility
operations.  The RSA shall acquire all other hardware items either through lease or purchase; title
to these items shall remain with the RSA or the lessors. 
<p>
The pre-operational activities shall include acquisition of those dual-purpose systems and related
hardware items needed for startup; provision of a startup supply of storage modules for the
Federal Facility; utility interface activities; coordination with the Federal Facility Operator and
other RSAs; refinement of Purchaser Site Service Plans and the Regional Servicing Plan;
establishment of an operating capability for waste acceptance and transportation; preparation of
procedures and training materials; staffing and training of personnel; performance of institutional
and outreach activities with the Public to include local, State and Tribal groups; establishment of
services capabilities; selection of routes; and other pre-operational activities necessary to support
SNF acceptance and transport.
<p>
Prior to commencement of Phase C operations, the RSA shall provide dual-purpose systems
and/or canisters in quantities needed for startup operations to those Purchasers in its region in
accordance with the Regional Servicing Plan.   
<p>
Prior to initiation of SNF shipments at the commencement of Phase C operations and consistent
with the Regional Servicing Plan, the RSA shall provide NRC approved storage modules suitable
for use at the NRC-licensed Federal Facility for canistered SNF as Phase B deliverables.  All
required cask-related lifting hardware items, ancillary equipment, and transporters, if required,
are the responsibility of the RSA and must be supplied to the Federal Facility Operator prior to
commencement of SNF delivery. 
<p>
The overall management function of the RSA in  the Phase B will continue beyond the first three
years of pre-operational startup activities through completion of the five years of waste
acceptance and transportation operations as a Phase B activity concurrent with Phase C activities. 
<p>

<h4>2.4  PHASE C - SNF ACCEPTANCE AND TRANSPORT</h4>
<p>
Commencement of Phase C will be dependent on establishment of SNF receiving capability at a
Federal Facility.  When Phase C activities are authorized,  the RSA shall commence waste
acceptance operations and transportation and delivery of Purchaser SNF to the Federal Facility. 
Additionally, the RSA shall provide NRC approved storage modules suitable for use at the NRC
licensed Federal Facility for storage of the canistered SNF delivered by the RSA.  In addition,
when authorized by OCRWM, the RSA will provide NRC approved storage systems and
canisters, in accordance with the Regional Servicing Plan.  These shall be  suitable for use at the
NRC licensed Federal Facility for uncanistered SNF as Phase C deliverables.  
<p>
Specific Phase C work includes: verification of SNF prior to shipment; validation of cask
loading, provision of transport services including in-transit physical protection, routing and pre-notifications; maintenance of a communications capability; provision of all heavy-haul and
intermodal transfer support; acquisition of permits; and maintenance of equipment.  The RSA
shall accept title to the SNF on behalf of OCRWM and shall act as the Shipping Agent on behalf
of OCRWM.
<p>
As indicated in <a href="1intro.htm#1.4.1">Section 1.4.1 </a> above, the first two years of SNF delivery are planned to be
made using only dual-purpose systems.  When the Federal Facility attains the capability  to
receive uncanistered SNF and OCRWM provides authorization, the RSA may commence
shipping uncanistered SNF to the Federal Facility in accordance with the Regional Servicing
Plan.

<html><body><h4>4.   TASKS</h4>
<p>
The tasks related to the work scope in this SOW are identified by contract phase.  Where the
same or similar tasks occur in two or more contract phases, the tasks are described in terms of
their applicability to the specific contract phases.  The tasks, subtasks, and activities are
described in detail in the following sections, and the products of these tasks and activities are
identified therein (e.g., plans, schedules, reviews, reports, hardware items, services, and other
deliverables).   Within the scope of this SOW, the RSA shall furnish all labor, materials,
facilities, services, equipment, management, administration, and all else necessary to develop and
implement Purchaser Site Service Plans and a Regional Servicing Plan for the term of the
contract.  The SNF transportation and storage systems to be used by the RSA shall comply with
the requirements of 10 CFR 71 and 10 CFR 72 respectively, and be NRC certified or approved. 
The transportation and storage systems technical requirements and specifications are in <a href="#Acquisition of Hardware Items">Section 4.2.2.2.</a>
<p>
<h4>4.1  PHASE A:  DEVELOPMENT OF SERVICING PLANS  </h4>
<p>
The work scope for Phase A: Development of Servicing Plans includes the functions of
management, planning and requirements development, and preparation of revised prices for
Phase B and Phase C.
<p>
    <strong> 4.1.1     Management</strong>
<p>
     The RSA management system shall be documented in the Management Plan and
     Subcontract Plan  which are described in the following sections:
<p>
          <strong>4.1.1.1  Management Plan.</strong>  The RSA  shall provide a Management Plan for
          Phase  B and Phase C which shall be updated  as required.  The management
          reports and reviews provided for in the Plan will be used by OCRWM to monitor
          the RSA's progress and performance of work scope.
     <p>     
          <strong>4.1.1.2  Subcontract Plan.</strong>  The RSA shall provide a Subcontract Plan identifying
          all key subcontractors.  This plan is separate and distinct from the subcontracting
          plan required under the Federal Acquisition Regulations.
<p>
         <strong> 4.1.1.3  Quality Assurance.</strong>  Because it is envisioned that the RSA will not be
          performing any work subject to the controls of the QARD in Phase A, the only
          QA requirements for Phase A activities are performance of the work using best
          commercial practices. 
<p>     
   <strong>  4.1.2     Phase A:  Development of  Plans</strong>
   <p>       
    <dl>
<dt> The plans and information to be developed during Phase A include:
<dd>          Purchaser Site Service Plans
<dd>          Regional Service Plan
<dd>          Acquisition Plan
<dd>          Phase B and Phase C Revised Prices
<dd>          QA Program and Plan
<dd>          Institutional Outreach Program Plan
</dl>
<p>
       <strong> 4.1.2.1  Purchaser Site Service Plans.</strong>   The Phase A RSA shall work with those
        Purchasers in its region as identified in the Regional Waste Acceptance Schedule
        for the Phase C operating period and prepare Purchaser Site Service Plans.  The
        Purchaser Site Service Plans will document the operating parameters at each
        Purchaser site that will govern the waste acceptance and on-site/near-site
        transportation operations.  The Purchaser Site Service Plans shall contain all
        planning information necessary  in sufficient detail to support preparation for and
        performance of the waste acceptance and transportation activities required to meet
        OCRWM's commitment under the Purchaser disposal contracts.  The RSA shall
        demonstrate  acceptance of the Site Service Plans by providing written Purchaser
        approval of the final Plans.   
<p>
        The Plans shall be provided to OCRWM for use in managing the Purchaser disposal
        contracts.
<p>
       <strong> 4.1.2.2  Regional Servicing Plan.</strong>  During Phase A, the RSA shall prepare a
        Regional Servicing Plan consistent with OCRWM guidance and the Purchaser Site
        Service Plans for the Purchasers in its region.  The Regional Servicing Plan shall
        contain time-phased, integrated schedules identifying each campaign for each
        Purchaser in the Regional Waste Acceptance Schedule for each year of the planned
        five years of operation in Phase C.  The plan shall identify all time-phased
        requirements for transportation and storage related hardware items, structures,
        systems and components, to include canisters and storage modules, and all
        transportation and intermodal services.  Based on the time-phased requirements, the
        RSA shall develop the regional operating fleet requirements by year, e.g., how many
        dual-purpose systems, transport-only casks, SNF canisters, storage modules, etc, by
        type and other systems or components that will be needed to support each year of
        operation. <p>
        The Regional Servicing Plan shall contain a section that describes the RSA's plans
        for acquiring all of the resources and assembling the organizational capabilities

 <strong>1.  <a name="introduction">Introduction</strong></a>
<p>
<dl>
1.1 <dd> This Concept of Operations for Waste Acceptance, Storage, and Transportation
presents a
     top-level description of the activities associated with accepting commercial spent nuclear fuel
(SNF)
     from the Purchasers, and transporting SNF from the Purchaser sites to a Federal Facility (i.e.,
     an interim storage facility or a repository).  It provides a general overview of the
     contingency plan for storing that SNF at an interim storage facility (ISF), provided
   statutory policy direction establishes an ISF.  It also identifies the responsibilities of the
   DOE Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management (OCRWM) and those delegated
     to contractors for waste acceptance, transportation and storage services.
<p></dl><dl>
1.2 <dd>    The description (in Section 2) begins with preparatory operations for waste
acceptance, 
  proceeds to operations for transportation and storage, and ends with preparation for
     shipment of SNF from an ISF to a repository.  Three operational modes for receipt
     through storage operations are depicted as occurring concurrently, these are for 1) SNF in
     canisters, 2) SNF in transportable storage casks, and 3) uncanistered SNF.  It is currently
     envisioned the operational capability to store SNF in canister systems and transportable
     storage casks (Phase I) will be achieved before the operational capability to receive
     uncanistered SNF and place it into storage (Phase II).
<p>
</dl><dl>1.3  
<dd>
The following organizations are identified as having roles in this concept of operations:
</dl><p>
     <ul>
<li> The Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management (OCRWM), or its M&O
         contractor and other support contractors.
<p>
  <li>   Purchasers: This refers to those parties who have title to SNF and have executed
          contracts with OCRWM.
<p>
<li>        Regional Servicing Agents (RSAs): This refers to the full-service contractors or
          contractor teams which will serve as OCRWM's agent in accepting SNF into the
          CRWMS, transporting the accepted SNF to a Federal Facility (i.e., an ISF or a
          repository), and providing transportation casks for transportation and storage
          modules for storage. 
<p>
<li>         Federal Facility Operator: This is the entity responsible for operating the Federal
Facility (either an ISF or repository).
</ul>
<p>
<dl>
1.4  <dd>The following assumptions have been made in preparing this concept of operations:
<p>
    <i> Assumption 1:   </i> Allocation of acceptance capacity will continue to be based on an
     "oldest-fuel-first" priority ranking.  Any deviations from such allocations must be done
     with the consent of the affected Purchaser(s).
<p>
     <i>Assumption 2: </i> The RSAs acquire, and deliver the storage modules for canistered and
     uncanistered SNF, as well as any transportable storage casks that the RSAs  will be using. 
<p>
   <i>  Assumption 3: </i> In the absence of preliminary or specific routing three years prior to
initial
     shipment, OCRWM will be able to determine which States and Tribes are impacted to
     support the allocation of 180(c) funds - even without RSA input.  The proposed routing
     information will be available from the RSAs two years prior to commencing
     transportation and storage operations (which is one year after contract award).
<p>
    <i> Assumption 4:</i>  Although the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) currently limits
     notification of shipments to States, OCRWM intends to notify - or have the RSA notify -
     Tribal governments of pending shipments through their jurisdictions as well.  This is in
     accordance with OCRWM policy and OCRWM Order 460.2.  This position will be
     coordinated with the NRC, and NRC concurrence with this practice will be received via 
     the NRC's review of the OCRWM Safeguards Transportation Plan. 
<p>
   <i>  Assumption 5:</i>  ISF design and operations will accommodate any form of
NRC-approved
     transport or storage technology provided by an RSA; however, these technologies must be
     compatible with the characteristics of the Federal Facility site as identified in the ISF
     Topical Safety Analysis Report.  In Phase I of ISF operations, this will include only
     canister systems and transportable storage casks; Phase II will add the capability to
     receive uncanistered fuel.
<p>
     <i>Assumption 6: </i>OCRWM will not provide a cask maintenance facility. The Federal
Facility Operator
     will perform decontamination if required, and perform the preparations necessary to ready
     the unloaded cask for off-site transport by the RSA.  
<p>
     <i>Assumption 7: </i>Initially, heavy haul may be the method of transport for rail casks from
an
     intermodal transfer point on an existing main line to a Federal Facility.  Such intermodal
     transfer and heavy haul activities will be conducted by the RSA.  
<p></dl>
  <strong>2. <a name="preparatory operations">Preparatory Operations</a></strong>
<p><dl>
2.1 <dd> The terms and conditions for waste acceptance and related services are either written
into
     or referenced by the Standard Contract.  If changes to the terms and conditions are
     required, OCRWM is responsible for ensuring that the Standard Contract is revised to
     reflect the new terms and conditions.
<p></dl><dl>
2.2  <dd>OCRWM shall issue a capacity report for planning purposes.  This report shall set forth
     the projected receiving capacity for the OCRWM facility(ies) and the acceptance ranking
     relating to OCRWM contracts for the disposal of SNF.  This report shall allocate capacity
     to Purchasers in the priority established in the Acceptance Priority Ranking for campaign
     periods.  The exact date that acceptance is initiated within this campaign period will be
     established subsequent to the issuance of the capacity report. 
<p></dl><dl>
2.3 <dd> Technical assistance and funds will be provided by OCRWM to the States and Tribes,
     through whose jurisdictions SNF will be transported, for training for safe routine
     transport and for dealing with emergency response situations in accordance with Section
     180(c) of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, as amended; this is anticipated to start
     approximately three years prior to commencing transportation through a given
     jurisdiction. Specific transportation routes will be identified by the RSAs in accordance
     with DOT and NRC regulations and submitted to the NRC for approval .
<p></dl><dl>
2.4  <dd>The RSAs will assume primary responsibility for the scheduling of  SNF deliveries. 
     After OCRWM has issued its capacity report itemizing acceptance allocations for the
     upcoming campaign period, Purchasers shall identify to OCRWM the locations of  SNF
     they wish to deliver.  This information will then serve to establish the regional waste
     acceptance schedules that will be specified by OCRWM.
<p></dl><dl>
2.5  <dd>The RSA will obtain any required Federal, State, Tribal and local government permits
for
     transportation.  The RSA will identify to OCRWM any local jurisdiction law requiring a
     permit which may be preempted by HM-164.  OCRWM will apply for a single
     preemption ruling which would cover all affected RSAs.  OCRWM will initiate and
     pursue any other required legal action related to such a preemption.
<p></dl><dl>
2.6 <dd>A detailed description of the SNF to be delivered is submitted by the Purchasers to the
     RSA.  The timing, description and review are per the requirements of the SNF
     Verification Plan.  The RSA supplies OCRWM with the detailed descriptions of the
     Purchaser SNF, and OCRWM maintains this data in the Unified Data Base System.
<p></dl><dl>
2.7  <dd>The RSA acquires the equipment needed for operations at the Purchaser site (as agreed
     upon with each Purchaser) and provides this equipment to the Purchaser.  Purchaser site
     personnel inspect and store the equipment until it is needed for loading operations.  The
     RSA provides training for the Purchaser site personnel in transportation cask operations
     before acceptance and shipment operations at a site commence. 
<p></dl><dl>
2.8  <dd>Before acceptance and shipment operations at a site begin, schedules and routes are
     verified by the RSA to ensure planned activities can be met.  During planning or
     operations, changes in the schedule for any site, or problems which occur regarding the
     interface with a Federal Facility are identified by the RSA and assessed by Federal
     Facility personnel to determine the impact they may have on the storage or disposal
     operations schedule.  The RSAs coordinate the delivery schedules.  Any impasses are
     elevated to OCRWM for resolution.  Individual participant and integrated schedules and
     plans are revised as necessary.
<p></dl><dl>
2.9<dd>  Before site operations begin, data for each shipment are assembled by the RSA,
including
     a detailed schedule, the detailed route plan, points of contact, safe parking and routine
     stop information, incident response information, and permits.  During the course of a
     shipment, the driver or in-transit physical security personnel accumulate additional
     information, thereby documenting the cask's movement from the beginning to the end of
     the shipment. This additional information includes shipping papers, cask inspection
     records, incident reports, driver's log, and any other appropriate information.
<p></dl><dl>
2.10 <dd>Cask preparation activities are conducted by the RSA.  Cask preparation activities
include
     configuring transportation casks, performing final tests and inspections, and preparing
     them for shipment.  Once the transportation casks are prepared for shipment, they are
     shipped by the RSA to the Purchaser site. 
<p></dl><dl>
2.11 <dd>In compliance with NRC requirements regarding schedule and content, shipment
     notifications are issued and state governors and Indian Tribes are officially notified by the
     RSA, as required, of scheduled shipments.

<strong>3.  <a name="pre-transport operations at the purchaser site"> Pre-Transport Operations
at the Purchaser Site</a></strong>
<p>
This section describes the "base case" process for operations at the Purchaser site.  This may be
modified per agreements between the RSA and Purchasers in response to site-specific needs and
preferences.  This section is based upon the premise that the cask to be delivered to the  Federal
Facility (i.e., repository or ISF) is loaded at the Purchaser site; it is not intended to prohibit the
RSA from using single purpose casks at the Purchaser site and then transferring the SNF into a
different cask (e.g., canisters with transportation casks) at some point between the Purchaser site
and a Federal Facility .
<p>
Furthermore, the activities described in this "base case" do <strong>not </strong>make use of dry transfer or a
transfer cask to load the transportation casks; rather, in-pool loading of the transportation casks is
described. This may be modified per agreements reached between the RSA and Purchasers.
<p><dl>
3.1 <dd> Unloaded legal weight truck casks or rail casks (i.e., casks for canisters, transportable
     storage casks, and single purpose rail casks) are delivered to the site by the RSA.  The
     cask and transporter are moved by the Purchaser into the site's protected area.  The
     Purchaser moves the cask and prepares it for loading.
<p></dl><dl>
3.2 <dd> Purchaser site personnel begin loading operations in accordance with approved
     procedures. They also perform loading verification activities which include confirmation
     of the identity of the assemblies placed into the cask or canister.  
<p></dl><dl>
3.3 <dd> After the cask is loaded, it is prepared for shipment by the Purchaser.
<p></dl><dl>
3.4  <dd>Subsequent preparation activities for pick-up of the transportation cask and transporter
by
     the prime mover are dependent upon the type of transportation cask and on the mode of
     transportation before departing the facility site.  The details are in the campaign plan for
     each site and are outlined below.
<p>
     <ol>
<li>  Legal weight truck casks are placed on trailers by the Purchaser.  When the RSA's
          tractor arrives, it is attached by the RSA to the loaded trailer.  (Legal weight truck
         casks may be transported by rail, in which case it is treated as a single purpose rail
        cask as described below.)
<p>
<li>           Canisters in transportation casks, transportable storage casks, and single purpose
               rail casks are transported by rail.  If the site is being serviced by rail, the cask is
              placed directly onto a rail car by the Purchaser.  A train may pick up several
              loaded rail cars from a single site, several loaded rail cars from different sites, or,
              shipment may be by general freight rather than dedicated train. 
<p>
          The exact transport mode or combination of modes used to move the cask are
          determined by the RSA in coordination with the Purchaser based on the site and
          near-site transportation infrastructure, and the Purchaser's preference.  The RSA
          is responsible for any near-Purchaser site intermodal transfer from heavy haul or
          barge to rail, including the acquisition of any necessary permits.
</ol></dl><dl>
3.5  <dd>Prior to departure, the cask, transporter, and prime mover undergo final checks and
     inspections by the RSA.  This includes verifying the transportation cask identification
     number and the integrity of tamper indicating devices.  For highway shipments, it also
     includes an Enhanced North American Standard inspection, as developed by the
     Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance, for vehicle, driver, and cargo by qualified state
     inspectors.  The RSA's carrier and in-transit physical security personnel are briefed in
     accordance with established procedures.  A final survey is made to ensure the cask meets
     contamination and dose rate limits.
<p></dl><dl>
3.6  <dd>After the cask and transporter pass their final checks and inspections, Purchaser site
     personnel turn over to the RSA documented verification that the cask was properly
     loaded, marked, and labeled.  Title transfer of the accepted SNF from the Purchaser to
     OCRWM is completed with the RSA serving as OCRWM's agent, and physical
     possession of the  SNF is taken by the RSA.  All information regarding cask loading,
     testing, inspection, and acceptance is recorded by the RSA.  
<p></dl>
<strong>4.  <a name="transportation operations"> Transportation Operations</a></strong>
<p><dl>
4.1 <dd>Loaded transportation casks are transported by the RSA off the Purchaser sites (1) by
     legal weight truck, (2) by rail, (3) by heavy-haul truck, or (4) by barge. 
<p><ol>
     <li>  Legal weight truck casks travel primarily by highway.  Legal weight truck casks
          that are transported by rail are treated in a manner similar to that described below
          for rail casks.
<p>
     <li>  Rail casks (i.e., canisters in transportation casks, transportable storage casks, and
          single purpose rail casks) on rail cars travel by rail as general freight or by
          dedicated train.  If a dedicated train is used, the locomotive may stop at several
          sites to pick up loaded transportation casks from each site before proceeding to a
          Federal Facility .  
<p>
     <li>  Rail casks departing sites by heavy haul truck are taken to an intermodal transfer
          point.  There they are transferred to either a rail car or a barge.  The RSA is
          responsible for any near-Purchaser site intermodal transfer from heavy haul or
          barge to rail, including the acquisition of any necessary permits. 
<p>
     <li>  Rail casks departing sites by barge are moved to port or barge slip where the cask
          can be off-loaded onto a rail car.
</ol><p></dl><dl>
4.2  <dd>Regardless of the transportation mode, all shipments are made by the RSA from the
     Purchaser site via a predetermined and NRC-approved route.  The RSA provides for
     continuous in-transit tracking and in-transit physical security in accordance with the
     OCRWM Safeguards Transportation Plan.  In the event of an in-transit incident, the RSA
     will contact OCRWM and the NRC; and support the appropriate authorities as requested. 
     OCRWM will have the responsibility for public outreach.
<p></dl><dl>
4.3 <dd> Loaded casks are delivered by the RSA to a Federal Facility.  The RSA transfers
     information regarding cask loading, testing, inspection, and acceptance to the Federal
     Facility operator.  Facility personnel inspect the loaded transportation cask, transporter,
     and prime mover.  The RSA completes the shipment documentation.
<p></dl><dl>
4.4 <dd> The transporter is moved into the facility's protected area where the transportation cask
is
     removed from the transporter by the facility personnel and placed in a holding area. An
     unloaded transportation cask on its transport skid is placed on the transporter by the
     facility personnel.  
<p></dl><dl>
4.5 <dd> The final surveys for contamination are performed.  Shipping papers are transferred to
the
     RSA and the transporter with an unloaded transportation cask departs the site.
<p></dl><dl>
4.6  <dd>The RSA is responsible for cask maintenance and disposal of any low-level waste
     generated during such maintenance. 
</dl><p>
<strong>5.  <a name="storage operations"> Storage Operations</a></strong>
<p><dl>
5.1 <dd> The RSA acquires the storage modules and supporting ancillary equipment and delivers
     them to a Federal Facility to support SNF delivery schedules. 
<p></dl><dl>
5.2 <dd> The Federal Facility Operator uses an on-site transporter to take a loaded transportation
cask to the
     transfer facility.  Inside the transfer facility, the transportation cask is placed in a
     preparation area where it is cleaned, decontaminated (if necessary), inspected, and
     prepared for the transfer of SNF into storage.  During transfer operations, the
     identification numbers of the fuel, canisters, and/or casks involved are recorded to
     provide appropriate material control and accounting and continuity of knowledge. These
     operations - all conducted by the Federal Facility Operator - are dependent upon the type of
     transportation cask.  The transfer of  SNF from (1) loaded canisters, (2) loaded
     transportable storage casks, and (3) single purpose rail casks and legal weight truck casks
     into the storage is discussed below.
<p>
  <ol><li>The transfer of SNF in canisters is performed either in a transfer room or, in the
          storage yard.  At this time, the transportation cask lid is removed, the canister
          transferred from the transportation cask to the storage module, the storage module
          closed, and the lid placed back on the transportation cask.
<p>
     <li>      The  transportable storage cask can be placed directly into storage. 
<p>
     <li>       The transfer of  uncanistered SNF from the transportation cask is performed in a 
               uncanistered SNF transfer cell. Then, the transportation cask lid is removed, the
               SNF is transferred from the transportation cask to a storage module, the storage
               module closed, and the lid placed back on the transportation cask. 
</ol></dl><dl><p>
5.4  <dd>The Federal Facility Operator removes the unloaded transportation cask from the
transfer area,
     decontaminates it as necessary for transport, and uses the on-site transporter to take the
     unloaded transportation cask to the holding area. 
<p></dl><dl>
5.5 <dd> After the SNF has been loaded, the Federal Facility Operator places it into storage. 
<p></dl><dl>
5.6 <dd> The SNF is prepared by the Federal Facility Operator for transport to a repository.

5.7  <dd>The Federal Facility Operator moves loaded transportation casks to the inspection
gatehouse using the
     on-site prime mover.  The organization responsible for shipment connects the rail cars to
     a transporter, and subjects the casks and rail cars to final checks and inspections.  All
     information regarding cask loading, testing, and inspection is recorded by the
     organization responsible for shipment and transferred to the RSA.  A final survey is made
     to ensure the cask meets contamination and dose rate limits.

<h2>1. Program Overview: Introduction</h2>
<hr>
<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>
The Civilian Radioactive Waste Management Program issued a program plan in December 1994
that described a new, more flexible approach to achieving the Program's objectives. During
1995, important progress was made. The Program has been required to revise that approach in
response to guidance from the President and the Congress and to the funding reduction in the
Fiscal Year 1996 program appropriation. This revised Program Plan has been prepared to
describe the changes we have made in our activities to the Congress, regulatory and oversight
bodies, other stakeholders, and the public.
<p>
<em>Section 1, Program Overview, </em>briefly reviews the Program's history and policy background,
discusses Congressional and Administrative actions during the past year, and summarizes the
revised program strategy, milestones, and funding requirements. <a href="ch21.htm"><em>Section 2, Program and Project
Activities</em></a>, describes the near-term activities planned under the revised strategy, and outlines
longer-term activities that assume the Yucca Mountain site is found suitable and that, in 1999, an
interim storage facility site is designated.<a href="apptoc.htm"> <em>Section 3, Appendices</em></a>, presents additional information
on program changes and background information on the Program.
<p>
In addition to incorporating changes that reflect current policy and funding realities, the <em>Civilian
Radioactive Waste Management Program Plan, Revision 1</em>, charts a path forward that will allow
the Program to achieve its ultimate goal: the safe disposal of the Nation's spent nuclear fuel and
high-level radioactive waste.
<p>
<h4>1.1 Solving a National Problem</h4>
<p>
The safe, long-term isolation of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste has become
one of the most challenging environmental problems confronting the Nation. Spent nuclear fuel
from commercial reactors has been accumulating throughout the United States since the first
commercial nuclear power plant started operating in December 1957. Since the Manhattan
Project began in 1942, the Federal Government has operated reactors and processed spent fuel
for defense nuclear activities, generating large quantities of high-level radioactive waste.
<p>
Much is at stake in the effort to resolve the problem of accumulating spent nuclear fuel and
high-level radioactive waste. Confidence in the ultimate removal of spent fuel from commercial
reactor sites is critical to maintaining public support for the nuclear-generating capacity that
currently supplies more than 20 percent of the Nation's electric energy. Permanent geologic
disposal is also the long-term destination of the high-level waste resulting from cleanup of the
Cold War weapons complex.
<p>
The challenge of safely managing and disposing of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive
waste has engaged the efforts of many individuals and organizations for decades. The Federal
Government's effort to find a long-term solution to this problem is receiving increased attention
from the Administration and the Congress as a result of escalating cost estimates, schedule
delays, and the unmet expectations of the initial policies. 
<p>
<h4>1.1.1     National Policy Adopted</h4>

The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 established the Federal Government's responsibility to
provide for the permanent disposal of the Nation's high-level radioactive waste and spent nuclear
fuel, and directed that the generators and owners of these wastes be responsible for the costs of
their management and disposal. The Act authorized the Department of Energy to develop a
system to safely manage and permanently dispose of the spent nuclear fuel accumulating at
commercial reactors.
<p>
The primary goal of the Act was the siting, construction, and operation of a mined geologic
repository. As originally enacted, the Act also directed the Department to study the need for and
feasibility of a monitored retrievable storage facility. The Act provided for the disposal of
defense-related high-level radioactive waste as well as spent nuclear fuel, if the President
determined that could be done. In 1985, the President found no basis to conclude that a
defense-only repository was required and, therefore, under provisions of the Act, the Department
was to proceed with plans and actions to dispose of defense waste together with commercial
spent nuclear fuel in a single repository. <em>See box on this page for a discussion of spent nuclear
fuel and high-level radioactive waste inventories.</em>
<p>
The Act directed that the civilian portion of the system be funded by the generators and owners
of nuclear-generated electricity through a fee on the commercial generation of nuclear power to
be deposited into the Nuclear Waste Fund. The portion of the system's cost for the disposal of
waste generated or owned by the Federal Government was to be paid for by the Government.
The Act directed the Department of Energy to undertake a national screening process for
candidate repository sites. In 1986, the Department recommended three sites to the President for
further study as possible geologic repositories. In the Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of
1987, the Congress redirected the Department to investigate only one potential repository site, at
Yucca Mountain, Nevada, and to report on the need for a second repository between 2007 and
2010. The Amendments Act also imposed conditions that restricted the Department's ability to
site and develop a storage facility.
<p>
<a href="./appa.htm"><em>Appendix A</em></a> provides a summary discussion of the "Evolution of the National Civilian
Radioactive Waste Management Program."
<hr>
<h5><strong>Spent Nuclear Fuel and High-Level Radioactive Waste Destined for Ultimate
Geologic Disposal<a href="./foot1.htm"> [1]</a></strong>
<p>
The United States has a growing inventory of spent nuclear fuel from commercial nuclear
reactors, currently stored in 33 States at 72 operating and shutdown commercial reactor sites and
one storage site. Existing pool storage facilities at commercial utility reactor sites are reaching
their full capacities. By the end of 1996, a projected 12 of the 72 commercial reactor sites in 11
States will require additional on-site storage (either pool or dry storage). The total cumulative
discharge of spent nuclear fuel from the 119 currently operating and shutdown commercial
nuclear reactors will total about 84,000 metric tons uranium (MTU) by the year 2035, when the
last commercial reactor completes its initial 40-year license period.
<p>
The Civilian Radioactive Waste Management Program estimates that approximately 13,800
canisters of primarily defense-related high-level radioactive waste will require disposal<a href="./foot1.htm">.[2] </a>
Program plans call for using approximately 10 percent of the repository's capacity for disposal of
radioactive waste from defense nuclear activities and spent nuclear fuel owned by the Federal
Government. The Government-owned spent nuclear fuel inventory is expected to be about 2,700
metric tons of heavy metal<a href="./foot1.htm">[3] </a>(MTHM) by the year 2035, most of which is spent fuel from
weapons material production reactors. It also includes 65 MTHM of spent nuclear fuel from
nuclear-powered naval vessels and 22 MTHM of spent nuclear fuel of U.S. origin from foreign
research reactors. </h5>
<hr>
<h4>1.1.2     Challenges in Implementing the Evolving National Policy</h4>
<p>
In the years since passage of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, the Civilian Radioactive Waste
Management Program has faced changing legislative mandates, regulatory modifications,
fluctuating funding levels, and the evolving and often conflicting needs and expectations of
diverse interest groups. During the 1980s, the real complexity of the scientific and regulatory
challenge at the Yucca Mountain site began to be realized, and projected costs greatly exceeded
initial expectations. It became increasingly clear that many of the expectations embodied in the
Nuclear Waste Policy Act could not be met.
<p>
The Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 1987 nullified the Department of Energy's
proposal to site a monitored retrievable storage facility at one of three locations within the State
of Tennessee and placed additional restrictions on interim storage siting. The Office of the
Nuclear Waste Negotiator, established by the 1987 amendments, was unable to secure a
volunteer host for a storage facility before the termination of the Office's authority in January
1995. While a number of local and Tribal governments considered the possibility of hosting a
storage facility in their jurisdictions, considerable opposition was generated within their
respective States and no final proposals for a Federal facility were developed.
<p>
The end result was increased Congressional and constituent dissatisfaction with the Program. By
1993, it became clear that continuation of the Program as then planned was no longer viable. The
issue was not whether a new approach was needed, but whether one could be found that would
accomplish the objectives of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act within practical resource limitations
and reasonable schedules. 
<p>
<h4>1.1.3     The 1994 Program Plan and Early Accomplishments</h4>
<p>
In 1993, we undertook a comprehensive assessment of the Program's activities to resolve the
disparity between the activities that were actually being carried out and stakeholder expectations
for costs, schedules, and accomplishments. We obtained the opinions of our oversight and
regulatory bodies, the Administration, the Congress, and key program stakeholders. From these
deliberations, we developed a new, more flexible approach to make measurable and significant
progress toward key objectives.
<p>
The new program approach, described in the December 1994 <em>Civilian Radioactive Waste
Management Program Plan</em>, addressed concerns with cost increases and schedule slippages. The
Congress endorsed the new approach by approving a 37 percent increase in funding for Fiscal
Year 1995. It was also generally endorsed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the
Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board.
<p>
We defined two major projects or "business centers" within the Program -- the Yucca Mountain
Site Characterization Project and the Waste Acceptance, Storage, and Transportation Project -- 
and created a Management Center to provide program integration and management support to the
Program Director and the projects.<a href="./fig1.gif"> <em>Figure 1</em></a> illustrates the program organization as restructured
under the 1994 program approach.
<p><pre>
<strong>                                        Figure 1
		     Civilian Radioactive Waste Management Program
			     Business Management Centers</strong><br>
		<img src="fig1.gif">
</pre><p>
The 1994 program approach refocused the work of the Yucca Mountain Site Characterization
Project business center on (1) evaluating by 1998 the technical suitability of the Yucca Mountain
site for development as a geologic repository; (2) delivering a statutory site recommendation and
Environmental Impact Statement to the President by 2000, contingent on a positive suitability
evaluation; and (3) submitting a license application to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission by
2001. We expected to receive authorization from the Commission to construct the repository in
2004, and 2010 remained the target for emplacing waste into a geologic repository.
<p>
The main objectives of the Waste Acceptance, Storage, and Transportation Project business
center were to (1) make a new generation of spent fuel storage and transportation technology,
multi-purpose canisters, available by 1998; (2) support timely resolution of waste acceptance and
interim storage issues; and (3) maintain readiness to develop a centralized interim storage facility
and a timely national capability to transport spent nuclear fuel. 
<p>
In Fiscal Year 1995, we made significant progress toward achieving the new program approach
objectives through the efficiencies gained from improved technical, cost, and schedule planning
and implementation; through a restructured organization focused on attaining measurable results
with clear lines of responsibility, authority, and accountability; and from the increased resources
provided by the Fiscal Year 1995 Congressional appropriation of $522 million. 
<p>
<strong>Yucca Mountain Site Characterization Accomplishments</strong><br>

The Yucca Mountain site investigation has been advanced greatly since the 1994 Program Plan
was developed. Excavation of the exploratory tunnel into Yucca Mountain is proceeding faster
than planned. No unexpected adverse features have been found. The rock quality at the potential
repository level is as good as or better than predicted, increasing the probability that a repository
with a nuclear waste capacity at the 70,000 metric tons uranium (MTU) statutory limit can be
constructed. The potential repository area is as dry as expected, with some indications that
ground water flow at the repository horizon has been very limited for 100,000 years or longer.
The scientific strategy for evaluating the ability of the repository to isolate waste has matured
significantly, due to the integration of available scientific knowledge and the new data being
obtained from the exploratory tunnel. The Program has completed a comprehensive analysis of
expected repository performance<em> (Total System Performance Assessment - 1995)</em> that materially
increases our understanding of the key issues important to safety, and advances the development
of a waste containment and isolation strategy for the repository concept.
<p>
These significant advances in the scientific evaluation of Yucca Mountain have allowed the
Program to focus on completing the information needed for an assessment in 1998 of the
viability of geologic disposal at the site as described in this revised Program Plan.
<p>
<strong>Waste Acceptance, Storage, and Transportation Accomplishments</strong><br>

In Fiscal Year 1995, the Program made meaningful progress in developing multi-purpose
canisters. A contract was awarded for the design and preparation of safety analyses for a
multi-purpose canister system, and a Preliminary Draft Environmental Impact Statement was
developed. One half-scale model of a high-capacity truck cask was fabricated and testing was
initiated. The Program also sought public comments on plans for providing technical and
financial assistance for training public safety officials along waste transportation routes.
<p>
<strong>Program Management Accomplishments
</strong><br>
Substantial improvements have been made in the integration and efficiency of program
management:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Program participants at the Yucca Mountain Site Characterization Project have either
been fully consolidated under the Management and Operating Contractor, or now work under a
Memorandum of Understanding with that organization.
<li>Management systems, such as cost and schedule baselines and reporting processes, were
restructured and streamlined to ensure more efficient utilization of resources and more effective
control of work scope.
</ul><p>
The improved management capability and planning basis have assisted in the Program's ability
to preserve the core scientific programs at Yucca Mountain at a reduced level of funding, and to
develop and propose a revised course of action that has the potential to regain the target of
repository licensing within a reasonable time frame.
<p>
Most of the program objectives targeted for Fiscal Year 1995 were accomplished and progress is
continuing, as indicated in<em> Table 1</em></a>. A few planned activities and milestones were revised or
deferred in response to expected Fiscal Year 1996 funding reductions. <a href="appb.htm"><em>Appendix B</em></a> provides an
expanded list of the Program's progress during Fiscal Year 1995.

<p>
<h4>1.2  Program Redirection and Transition</h4>
<p>
 <h4>1.2.1    Revisiting the National Policy on Radioactive Waste Management</h4>
<p>
While the Program was implementing its new approach, the national policy debate on the issues
of the near-term management of radioactive waste intensified. Nearly a dozen legislative
proposals were introduced in both chambers of the Congress during 1995. Some of these would,
if enacted, significantly alter the basic policies established by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of
1982 and its 1987 amendments.
<p>
The most comprehensive of the pending bills address demands by the nuclear power industry and
State utility regulators in States with commercial nuclear power plants that the Congress declare
that the Department of Energy has an unconditional obligation to begin acceptance of
commercial spent nuclear fuel by 1998. These bills would authorize and direct the Department to
begin development work immediately on an interim storage facility at a Congressionally
designated site.
<p>
<h4>1.2.2     Congressional Appropriations Action For Fiscal Year 1996</h4>
<p>
The Fiscal Year 1996 appropriations process took place in the midst of both this legislative
activity and the larger debate over deficit reduction and balancing the national budget. Deficit
reduction pressures and an emphasis on interim storage issues resulted in appropriations
decisions that have had a significant impact on the Program.
<p>
The Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act of 1996 provided a total of $400 million
for the Program, $85 million of which was designated to be used only for the development of an
interim storage facility and only upon enactment of new statutory authority. Pending such
authority, the Program was effectively reduced to a $315 million funding level, or one-half of the
$630 million funding level anticipated for the continuation of the 1994 program approach.
<p>
The Congress recognized that the significant reduction in funding would require a more
constrained repository program. The Conference Report accompanying the appropriations
language provided the following guidance:
<p>
<em>"The conferees agree on the importance of continuing existing scientific work at Yucca
Mountain to determine the ultimate feasibility and licensability of the permanent repository at
that site. The conferees direct the Department to refocus the repository program on completing
the core scientific activities at Yucca Mountain. The Department should complete excavation of
the necessary portions of the exploratory tunnel and the scientific tests needed to assess the
performance of the repository. It should defer preparation and filing of a license application for
the repository with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission until a later date. The Department's goal
should be to collect the scientific information needed to determine the suitability of the Yucca
Mountain site and to complete a conceptual design for the repository and waste package for later
submission to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission."<a href="./foot1.htm">[4]</a>
</em><p>
<h4>1.2.3     Fiscal Year 1996 Appropriations Impact on the Program</h4>
<p>
Under the funding reductions for Fiscal Year 1996, the 1994 program approach was no longer
sustainable. We were required to take immediate action to reduce spending in a manner that
ensures the Program's ability to meet its legal obligations and avoid a funding deficiency in
Fiscal Year 1996. Our only recourse was to try to preserve the most critical activities while we
made the required reductions and bore the resulting termination costs.
<p>
Based on the expectation of a reduced budget from the Fiscal Year 1995 level of $522 million to
$400 million, and observing the guidance contained in the early Congressional reports, action
was taken in September 1995 to reduce contractor work scope and eliminate about 875 contractor
jobs during Fiscal Year 1996 primarily within the Yucca Mountain Site Characterization Project
in Nevada<a href="./foot1.htm">.[5]</a> In November 1995, more than 200 additional contractor jobs were eliminated to
reflect the Congressional reservation of $85 million for the development of an interim storage
facility. Consistent with the nature of that restriction and the already severe impact of the initial
reduction on the repository program, this second reduction primarily affected the work of the
Waste Acceptance, Storage, and Transportation Project and Management Center.
<p>
The Yucca Mountain Site Characterization Project's funding was reduced from $375 million in
Fiscal Year 1995 to $250 million in Fiscal Year 1996. Consistent with the Congressional
guidance provided in the Conference Report accompanying the appropriations language, the
Yucca Mountain Site Characterization Project was refocused to emphasize core scientific
activity, excavation of sections of the Exploratory Studies Facility necessary for scientific study,
and completion of the repository and waste package conceptual designs. Activities supporting
preparation and filing of a license application for the repository were deferred.
<p>
The Waste Acceptance, Storage, and Transportation Project's funding was reduced from $57
million in Fiscal Year 1995 to approximately $14 million in Fiscal Year 1996. As a result of this
reduction, the Program has had to terminate funding for Phase II of the multi-purpose canister
program, during which Nuclear Regulatory Commission certification of the design developed
during Phase I would have been received. The contract for the multi-purpose canister
development program is being brought to an orderly close. The Department of Energy ceased to
be the lead agency on the Environmental Impact Statement for the multi-purpose canister, and
responsibilities have been assumed by the Department of the Navy for naval spent nuclear fuel
container selection.
<p>
We will also terminate the contract for certifying two General Atomics high-capacity
transportation casks (the GA-4 and GA-9 casks), which would have provided an option for
transporting uncanistered spent fuel from reactors to a storage or disposal facility by truck. 
<p>
Cooperative agreements between the Program and external organizations involved in nuclear
waste policy or activities have been reduced in Fiscal Year 1996 to approximately one-third of
their Fiscal Year 1995 funding level.
<p>
Program Management Center funding was reduced by 43 percent from $90 million in Fiscal Year
1995 to $51 million in Fiscal Year 1996. Major cuts have been made in the work scope and
contractor support for program management functions, which include the activities of the Office
of Human Resources and Administration, the Office of Quality Assurance, and the Office of
Program Management and Integration.
<p>
<h4>1.2.4     President's Program Guidance for Fiscal Year 1997</h4>
<p>
The President's Fiscal Year 1997 budget request provided additional guidance to the Program by
underscoring the Administration's continued commitment to geologic disposal. The budget
request endorses Congress' recommendation to concentrate initially on addressing the major
unresolved technical questions at the Yucca Mountain site. It provides $400 million for the
Program, $339 million of which would go to the Yucca Mountain Site Characterization Project.
Of the remaining funds, the Waste Acceptance, Storage, and Transportation Project would
receive $10 million and the Management Center $51 million.
<p>
The President's Fiscal Year 1997 budget request defines a new program objective:  to address by
1998 the remaining significant technical questions regarding the Program's hypotheses about the
Yucca Mountain site and the scientific, engineering, and financial feasibility of building a
geologic repository there. Consistent with Fiscal Year 1996 Congressional guidance, the Program
will make an assessment in 1998 of the viability of geologic disposal at Yucca Mountain. The
assessment will consist of a package of tasks that will provide an understanding of the repository
design and its performance in the geologic setting; an estimate of the remaining work needed to
prepare a license application; and a more precise estimate of the cost of a repository. The
viability assessment will also contribute to the preparation of the subsequent, statutorily required
Secretarial site recommendation to the President, if the site is found to be suitable, and to the
license application to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The President's budget request also
provides for funds to carry out the legal responsibilities of the Waste Acceptance, Storage, and
Transportation Project and to perform contingency planning to maintain an ability to respond
rapidly should the Administration and the Congress agree on new policy direction for interim
storage.

<h4>1.3 Revised Program Strategy</h4>
<p>
The Program has defined a revised program strategy consistent with the guidance provided by the
President and the Congress, the exigencies of the Fiscal Year 1996 situation, and the outlook for
future funding. Available resources have been concentrated on those efforts that are most
essential to the long-range success of the Program's mission to manage and dispose of the
Nation's spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste. With adequate future funding, the
revised strategy will enable the Program to maintain progress toward accomplishing the goals of
the Nation's civilian radioactive waste management policy on a reasonable schedule.
<p>
The revised program strategy is designed to maintain the momentum that has been achieved in
the scientific investigation of the Yucca Mountain site and to regain target dates for determining
the site's suitability for a geologic repository and for submitting a license application. The efforts
of the Yucca Mountain Site Characterization Project have been redirected to address the major
unresolved technical questions so that, in 1998, an assessment can be made of the viability of
licensing and constructing a repository at the Yucca Mountain site. The Program will also
consider revisions to the regulatory framework which may be needed to implement the
restructured repository project plan. The Program expects to apply to the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission in 2002 for a license authorizing construction of a repository at the Yucca Mountain
site.
<p>
The Program will maintain a core capability in the Waste Acceptance, Storage, and
Transportation Project to lay the groundwork for new policy direction regarding interim storage.
We have devised a strategy based upon the assumption that an interim storage facility site will be
designated in 1999. This assumption reflects the Administration's position that the interim
storage facility siting decision should be informed by the results of the Yucca Mountain viability
assessment to be completed in 1998.<a href="./foot1.htm">[6]</a>
<p>
Some waste acceptance, storage, and transportation activities can be conducted prior to
designation of an interim storage facility site, and could expedite the start of interim storage
operations when a site is designated and the facility authorized. These activities are the
development of a market-driven approach that relies on the private sector for waste acceptance,
storage, and transportation services, and the conduct of design, engineering and safety analyses
for a non-site specific, phased, interim storage facility. Work to be accomplished after a site is
designated includes facility development and the acquisition of waste acceptance, storage, and
transportation equipment and services from the private sector.<a href="./appc.htm"><em> Appendix C</em></a> discusses activities to
be conducted after a site is designated.
<p>
Finally, the efficiency of program management has been significantly improved to reduce
management costs. The program management function will be further refined to support the
revised strategy and to enhance our management capabilities in the particular area of
management information and control systems. 
<p>
The key elements of the revised program strategy are summarized below. An expanded
discussion is provided in <em><a href="./ch21.htm">Sections 2.1</a>,<a href="./ch22.htm"> 2.2,</a> and <a href="./ch23.htm">2.3.</a></em>
<p>
<h4>1.3.1     Update the Regulatory Framework for a Repository at Yucca Mountain in 1997</h4>
<p>
Based on our site characterization progress and the policy changes that have occurred over the
past 10 years, we will propose amendments to the Department's siting guidelines (10 CFR Part
960) that will lead to a more efficient process for evaluating the suitability of the Yucca
Mountain site for development as a geologic repository. Efficiencies will result from adopting a
streamlined methodology specific to the Yucca Mountain site for applying the siting guidelines.
Siting guideline revisions will be developed concurrently with the development of a site-specific
radiological protection standard for Yucca Mountain by the Environmental Protection Agency
and conformance of the licensing regulations to this new standard by the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission. We will continue to consult with the Agency, the Commission, and other
stakeholders as the regulatory framework for the geologic repository is updated.
<p>
<h4>1.3.2     Complete Viability Assessment of the Yucca Mountain Repository Site in 1998</h4>
<p>
A principal objective of the revised strategy is to address by 1998 the major unresolved technical
questions so that an informed assessment can be made of the viability of licensing and
constructing a geologic repository at the Yucca Mountain site. This objective will require the
completion of tasks that constitute a logical convergence point in the Program's work. The tasks
include:
<p>
<ul>
<li>a package of more specific design work on the critical elements of the repository concept
and the waste package;
<li> a total system performance assessment, based upon that design concept and the scientific
data and analysis that will be available to us by 1998, which will describe the probable behavior
of the repository in the Yucca Mountain geologic setting;
<li>   a plan and cost estimate for the remaining work required to complete a license
application; and
<li>    an upgraded estimate of the costs to construct and operate the repository in accordance
with the design.
</ul><p>
The Congress directed, and the reduced funding level in Fiscal Year 1996 has required, that
repository licensing activities be deferred. The goal of submitting a successful license application
to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, however, remains central to the Program's mission. The
work completed for the viability assessment will be an early and integral step on the path to a
license application. The Administration's budget request for Fiscal Year 1997 sets forth a scope
of work, budget profile, and schedule for the Yucca Mountain Site Characterization Project that
are capable of supporting an application to the Commission for the repository license in 2002.
The revised Program Plan is consistent with that funding outlook, with the Nuclear Waste Policy
Act, as amended, and with the current understanding of the waste containment and isolation
strategy appropriate to the Yucca Mountain site. The Program's regulatory approach and plans
set forth earlier in the evolution of the Yucca Mountain Project will be revised to reflect the new
approach.
<p>
<h4>1.3.3     Recommend a Repository Site to the President in 2001 and Submit a Repository License
Application to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in 2002</h4>
<p>
The Program's strategy for the Yucca Mountain Site Characterization Project has been revised to
identify, prioritize, and schedule a focused set of site characterization activities that will allow us
to submit a license application for construction authorization in 2002. Our activities will
concentrate on the factors that are significant to the performance of a repository at the Yucca
Mountain site. After completion of the viability assessment in 1998, we will prepare the
additional information required for the Secretary of Energy's site recommendation to the
President and for the license application to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. As part of the
site recommendation and license application process, we will issue the Draft Repository
Environmental Impact Statement for public review and comment in 1999 and issue the Final
Repository Environmental Impact Statement and Record of Decision in 2000. If the site is found
suitable in accordance with our revised siting guidelines, the Secretary will issue a site
recommendation in 2001, following public hearings that the Program will conduct in the State of
Nevada prior to the possible site recommendation. The decision on site recommendation will be
based on the data obtained from site characterization, a description of the proposed repository
and waste package, the Final Repository Environmental Impact Statement, preliminary
comments from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission on the sufficiency of our information for
licensing, the views and comments of the State of Nevada, and other relevant information
required by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, as amended. If the site is approved, we will submit a
license application in 2002. This schedule will allow us to meet our long-term goal of starting
repository emplacement operations in 2010.
<p>
<h4>1.3.4     Develop Market-Driven Waste Acceptance, Storage, and Transportation Approach</h4>
<p>
The revised program strategy includes a market-driven approach that relies on the private sector
for transportation, storage, and waste acceptance services. The approach will allow for the
maximum use of private industry capabilities, expertise, and experience in accepting,
transporting, and storing commercial spent nuclear fuel. The Program plans to develop and
implement a competitive procurement process resulting in awards of fixed-price, multi-year,
performance-based contracts to obtain needed services and equipment at a reasonable cost.
Incentives and flexibility will be offered to encourage innovative private sector approaches.
Under this approach, private industry will act for the Department in carrying out certain functions
under the <em>Standard Contract for Disposal of Spent Nuclear Fuel and/or High-Level Radioactive
Waste (10 CFR Part 961)</em> to accept spent nuclear fuel at utility sites for delivery to a Federal
facility.
<p>
<h4>1.3.5     Conduct Non-Site Specific Design and Engineering Safety Analyses</h4>
<p>
Our interim storage readiness capability will be based upon a phased interim storage facility
consistent with the concept discussed during Congressional debate. We will address the
technical, safety, and procedural issues involved in licensing an interim storage facility to
expedite the process if an interim storage site is designated. We have initiated development of a
non-site specific topical safety analysis report for the first phase of operations at an interim
storage facility. This report is scheduled to be submitted to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission
for review in 1997. Completion of a topical safety analysis report and its subsequent submittal to
the Commission for review and approval are contingent upon adequate future funding. 
<p>
<h4>1.3.6     Restructure Program Management Activities</h4>
<p>
The revised strategy also restructures program management activities consistent with a reduced
funding level and the Program's refocused priorities. The Management Center will provide
continued administrative support and strategic planning assistance to the Yucca Mountain Site
Characterization Project and Waste Acceptance, Storage, and Transportation Project as the
revised Program Plan is implemented. It will address the crosscutting issues affecting both
business centers, and support the Director's office in overall management and representation of
the Program and in development of program policies and strategic plans. Efforts will concentrate
on improving and updating management systems to ensure the efficient application of reduced
funding levels to program priorities. Emphasis will also be placed on increasing the ability of the
Federal management staff to carry out its responsibilities with reduced contractor support.

<body><h2>2. Program and Project Activities: Introduction</h2>
<hr>
<h4>Introduction </h4>
<p>
This section describes the near-term activities planned under the revised program strategy, and
provides redefined schedule targets. The section also addresses some of the longer-term activities
contemplated, based on the assumption that the Yucca Mountain site is found suitable and that
the President and the Congress provide further direction regarding interim storage policy. <em>Section
2.1</em> addresses activities of the Yucca Mountain Site Characterization Project, <em>Section 2.2</em>
describes Waste Acceptance, Storage, and Transportation Project activities, and <em>Section 2.3</em>
describes support activities to be conducted by the Management Center.
<p>
<h4>2.1 Yucca Mountain Site Characterization Project</h4>
<p>
<strong>Background</strong><br>

The 1988 Yucca Mountain Site Characterization Project's <em>Site Characterization Plan</em>, required by
the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, had a threefold purpose: (1) to describe the Yucca Mountain site
and preliminary designs for a repository and waste package; (2) to identify issues related to the
Yucca Mountain site's suitability as a repository, based on our level of knowledge about the site
in 1988, that could be resolved during site characterization, and to identify a strategy for
resolving these issues; and (3) to describe plans for a comprehensive program of scientific
investigations and engineering design that could be conducted to obtain sufficient information to
resolve these issues. Our level of knowledge about the site has increased over the last decade as
we collected and analyzed scientific data from the surface and subsurface. This knowledge has
enabled us to evolve our strategy. This evolution, together with the recognition that the level of
resources that would be required to carry out the full program described in the <em>Site
Characterization Plan</em> had not been provided, led to our 1994 Program Plan. Substantial progress
in the past few years in scientific investigations and underground construction, combined with
the necessity to determine the least costly acceptable work plan, has resulted in this revision to
our 1994 Program Plan.
<p>
The 1994 Program Plan represented a fundamental change in the site characterization strategy.
Scientific investigations and engineering design activities were re-prioritized to assure that
information would be available to support an early evaluation of technical site suitability of the
Yucca Mountain site in 1998. In addition, concurrent work on the development of an
Environmental Impact Statement and license application was planned, with the expectation that
this work would continue beyond the suitability determination and result in a Final
Environmental Impact Statement, Record of Decision, and site recommendation in 2000.
Confirmatory testing was planned after the license application to increase confidence and refine
designs. The 1990 report, <em>Rethinking High-level Waste</em>, by the National Academy of Sciences,
stressed that it was unrealistic to assume that all information for resolving all issues could be
available before a repository was constructed. Furthermore, the Congress, through the Nuclear
Waste Policy Act, recognized that information would continue to be evolving through the
construction, operation and potential retrieval periods of a repository. Under the 1994 Program
Plan, we expected to submit a license application to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in
2001, and start repository operations in 2010.
<p>
In the Fiscal Year 1996 appropriation cycle, the Yucca Mountain Site Characterization Project
funding was reduced by 33 percent from $375 million in Fiscal Year 1995 to $250 million in
Fiscal Year 1996. The Congress recognized that a more constrained repository program would be
required. The Conference Report accompanying the appropriations language provided specific
guidance to refocus the Yucca Mountain Project to: emphasize core scientific activities; complete
excavation of necessary portions of the Exploratory Studies Facility and scientific tests needed to
assess performance of the repository; and complete the repository and waste package conceptual
design. The guidance also provided for the deferral of activities supporting preparation and filing
of a license application for the repository.
<p>
In response to this guidance and the additional policy decisions associated with the development
of the President's Fiscal Year 1997 budget request, the strategy for the Yucca Mountain Site
Characterization Project has been revised to identify, prioritize, and schedule a set of site
characterization activities that will allow us to maintain our long-term objective of starting
repository operations in 2010. Based on the knowledge we have gained through scientific
investigations and engineering design activities conducted to date, as well as streamlining and
focusing both technical and regulatory elements of our site characterization program, we have
defined three near-term objectives:  complete an update to our regulatory framework in 1997;
complete a viability assessment in 1998; and recommend the repository site to the President in
2001 and submit a license application to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in 2002. These
objectives are summarized below.
<p>
<strong>Update the Regulatory Framework for a Repository at Yucca Mountain in 1997</strong><br>

In 1996 we plan to publish a notice of proposed rulemaking to amend our siting guidelines (10
CFR Part 960) to make them specific to the Yucca Mountain site. This revision is in response to
national policy changes as well as the significant increase in our understanding of the Yucca
Mountain site since these guidelines were promulgated in 1984. After completion of the public
comment period, we will publish the final rule in 1997. The Program will also continue to
interact with the Environmental Protection Agency and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission as
they promulgate regulations specific to a repository at Yucca Mountain.
<p>
<strong>Complete the Viability Assessment of the Yucca Mountain Site in 1998 </strong><br>

This assessment will consist of repository and waste package designs; an evaluation of the
probable performance of the system of natural and engineered barriers; a plan and cost estimate
to complete the additional technical work needed to prepare a license application; and an
estimate of the costs to construct and operate a repository using these designs. We believe that
these components, taken together, will provide a better understanding of the repository design
and its performance in the geologic setting, a better appreciation of the remaining work needed to
prepare a license application, and a more precise estimate of the cost of a repository. The
completion of these components will constitute a logical convergence point at which we can
make a measurably improved appraisal of the prospects for geologic disposal at the Yucca
Mountain site and provide this information to the Administration and the Congress. 
<p>
To support this objective, we plan to complete excavation of the Exploratory Studies Facility
main tunnel at the potential repository level in 1996. This excavation will allow underground
testing to collect key scientific and engineering data for site characterization and design.
<p>
<strong>Recommend a Repository Site to the President in 2001 and Submit a Repository License
Application to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in 2002</strong> <br>

After 1998, we will complete the activities described in a license application plan developed as
part of the viability assessment. A Project Integrated Safety Assessment will be prepared in 1999
and submitted to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for preliminary comments on its
sufficiency for licensing. We will issue the Draft Environmental Impact Statement for public
review and comment in 1999 and issue the Final Environmental Impact Statement and Record of
Decision in 2000. If the site is found suitable, the Secretary will issue a site recommendation in
2001. Prior to making a decision on site recommendation, we will announce a schedule for
public hearings in the vicinity of Yucca Mountain on the possible recommendation. After the
hearings and prior to recommending the site to the President, we will notify the State of Nevada
about the decision to recommend the site. If the site is approved, we will submit a license
application for construction authorization to the Commission in 2002.
<p>
The remainder of <em>Section 2.1 </em>further describes our revised Project objectives, the bases for the
revised objectives, key technical activities supporting the revised objectives, key management
activities, project milestones, and funding requirements.

<h4>2.1.1     Revised Project Objectives</h4>
<p>
The three near-term Project objectives are described in more detail below.
<p>
<strong>Updating the Regulatory Framework for a Repository at Yucca Mountain in 1997</strong><br>

The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 set forth the requirements from which the repository
Program's current regulatory framework was developed. This regulatory framework has three
key components. The Act required: (1) the Department of Energy to issue general guidelines for
the recommendation of sites for repository development; (2) the Environmental Protection
Agency to promulgate generally applicable standards for protection of the environment; and (3)
the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to promulgate technical requirements and criteria to be used
for repository licensing. In response to this Congressional direction, the Department of Energy
issued 10 CFR Part 960, the Environmental Protection Agency issued 40 CFR Part 191, and the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission issued 10 CFR Part 60. 
<p>
<strong>Rationale for Regulatory Revision</strong><br>

Two significant developments have occurred since the regulatory framework for developing
geologic repositories was established more than a decade ago. At the inception of the Civilian
Radioactive Waste Management Program, the Nuclear Waste Policy Act required the
characterization of several potential repository sites in different geologic media. This policy
changed when the Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 1987 directed the Department to
characterize a single site, Yucca Mountain, Nevada, instead of all three sites being considered at
the time. The regulatory framework discussed above was not based upon criteria relevant to a
specific site, but rather was intended to be applied generically to any potential geologic
repository site. Although it was evident that not every factor included in the Department's siting
guidelines (10 CFR Part 960) would be significant to evaluating the suitability of a particular
site, the scientific and technical understanding of the Yucca Mountain site was not then sufficient
to support revising these guidelines. 
<p>
A second change that impacted the regulatory framework occurred when the 1992 Energy Policy
Act directed the Environmental Protection Agency to promulgate a site-specific radiation
protection standard for Yucca Mountain. This standard is currently being developed. It will
replace 40 CFR Part 191, which is no longer applicable to Yucca Mountain. The Energy Policy
Act also directed the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to revise its licensing regulations (10 CFR
Part 60) to be consistent with the site-specific standard developed by the Environmental
Protection Agency. 
<p>
In addition to these policy developments, the Program has greatly improved its understanding of
the conditions at the Yucca Mountain site. In light of the recent Congressional direction to the
Environmental Protection Agency and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to develop
site-specific regulations, and the recent significant advances we have made in our understanding
of the site, the Program has decided to clarify and streamline our siting guidelines. The resulting
regulatory framework will provide a more efficient and understandable process for site
evaluation and repository development that more clearly focuses on protecting the health and
safety of the public.
<p>
The Nuclear Waste Policy Act recognized that revisions to the siting guidelines might be
necessary and authorized the Secretary to revise them as needed. These guidelines will be
amended through a public rulemaking process that will provide an opportunity for public
participation. The resulting guidelines must be concurred on by the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission. The Program will work to ensure that we receive this concurrence by focusing on
safety, consistent with the licensing requirements of the Commission. 
<p>
<strong>Scope of Regulatory Revision</strong><br>

The siting guidelines will be revised to identify the criteria and clarify the process for evaluating
the suitability of the Yucca Mountain site. The amendments will reflect the technical knowledge
gained at Yucca Mountain and the changes made since the guidelines were initially promulgated
in 1984. The proposed revision will add a methodology for applying the siting guidelines specific
to Yucca Mountain.
<p>
We will propose to evaluate the suitability of Yucca Mountain based upon the overall
performance of the repository system during operations and after closure, rather than separately
evaluating individual aspects of the site. An overall system performance approach is the
appropriate method to consider all relevant site features, because it identifies, in an integrated
manner, those attributes of the site and engineered components that are most important to the
protection of health and safety. The information gained from the site investigations and the total
system performance assessments show that the significance of selected site characteristics should
not be judged in isolation from one another or from a specific design concept. For example, a
geologic structural feature that provides a fast pathway for groundwater flow through the
mountain may seem a detriment when considered alone but, when considered in conjunction with
a specific repository design, may act beneficially by channeling flow away from the waste and
thus reducing the potential for groundwater contact with the waste packages. 
<p>
While the proposed rule will identify the criteria and process that will be used by the Program to
evaluate the suitability of Yucca Mountain, the details regarding site characterization activities
and the relationship between the revised testing plans and the 1988 <em>Site Characterization Plan</em>
will continue to be reported through the semiannual <em>Site Characterization Progress Reports</em>, as
required by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act. The relationship between the siting guidelines and
these documents will be described in the rulemaking.
<p>
<strong>Completing the Viability Assessment of the Yucca Mountain Site in 1998<br>
</strong>
The viability assessment will include four components: (1) designs for critical underground
features of the repository and for the waste package; (2) an updated total system performance
assessment; (3) a license application plan; and (4) repository cost and schedule estimate. We
have prioritized and integrated our science, engineering, and management activities to support
completion of these components in 1998.
<p>
After completion of the viability assessment, this same body of work will serve as a foundation
for the Program's evaluation of site suitability, development of an Environmental Impact
Statement, a Secretarial site recommendation to the President, and a license application to the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
<p>
<strong>Repository and Waste Package Design 
</strong><br>
The first component of the viability assessment will address those design elements that are
critical to determining the feasibility and performance of the repository and the engineered
barrier system. The effort will evaluate the technological feasibility of the designs but will not yet
contain the detail needed for licensing. The designs will build on our existing design work
documented in the 1996 <em>Mined Geologic Disposal System Advanced Conceptual Design Report,</em>
with emphasis placed on the key technical questions that affect waste containment and isolation,
performance, and cost. These questions revolve around thermal management of the
waste-generated heat, corrosion of waste packages, the role of supplemental engineered barriers,
and transport of radioactive wastes. In addition, the effort will address concepts for waste
retrieval operations, performance confirmation requirements, safety systems, and other factors
that significantly affect repository costs.
<p>

     <img src="fig5.jpg">
</pre><br>
<h6>A conceptual design of a waste package for spent nuclear fuel. The waste package will consist of multiple metal barriers designed to contain the wastes by resisting corrosion for thousands of years.</h6>
<p>
Scientific and engineering information gained during construction and testing in the Exploratory
Studies Facility, as well as results from surface-based and laboratory testing, will be incorporated
into the designs. Scientific investigations and performance assessment activities will provide data
and requirements for these designs. These designs for the viability assessment will identify the
additional design detail needed to support the license application, and will contribute to the total
system performance assessment.<a href="./fig5.jpg"> <em>Figure 5</a> (on the preceding page) and <a href="./fig6.jpg">Figure 6</a> (on this page)
illustrate our current conceptual design for the waste package and potential repository.</em>

</pre><br>

<h6>A schematic view of the design of the potential repository. The emplacement drifts will be divided into two areas. The upper block will be larger and will lie to the west of and slightly higher than the lower block.</h6>
<p>

<strong>Total System Performance Assessment</strong><br>
The second component of the viability assessment will be an updated total system performance
assessment based on our design concepts and the analyses of available site and engineering data.
The primary objective of the total system performance assessment, as described in the box on this
page, is to evaluate the probable behavior of the potential repository. An additional objective is to
further refine our evaluations of repository performance under a range of normal conditions and
under conditions imposed by potentially disruptive events, such as earthquakes and volcanism.
The performance assessment will also evaluate the possible range of performance caused by
uncertainty in predicting key factors such as ground-water flow, thermal effects, and corrosion. 
<hr>
<h5>Total System Performance Assessment <p>
Performance assessment is an analytical technique that uses computer models to evaluate the
ability of the repository site to contain and isolate wastes within the context of applicable safety
standards. This ability will depend on the characteristics of the natural geologic barrier and the
engineered barrier, which includes the waste package and any supplemental man-made barriers.
Mathematical models of the physical processes that affect waste containment and isolation, such
as water flow in the geologic setting, are abstracted, or simplified, and linked to one another in
order to develop an estimate of the overall performance of the repository, referred to as a<em> total
system performance assessment</em>. To evaluate potential radiation exposure to the public from the
waste emplaced in the repository site, performance assessment uses biosphere models. A
biosphere model describes the pathways by which individuals in the vicinity of Yucca Mountain
might receive doses from radionuclides that have been released from a repository. Performance
assessments are iterative, in that the information gained from each effort, together with newly
acquired scientific and engineering information, is used to guide subsequent assessments. The
latest iteration, <em>Total System Performance Assessment - 1995</em>, has provided insights for the
development of this revision to the Program Plan. 
 <p>
The overall philosophy of any total system performance assessment is to evaluate future
repository behavior by using models and parameters that are as representative as current
information allows. In those cases where representative information is not available or is very
uncertain, conservative assumptions must be made. 
<p>
An important objective of performance assessment modeling is to identify the significance of the
current uncertainty in processes, models, and parameters on the system performance. The impact
of the uncertainty is directly evaluated in the assessments themselves by the probabilistic nature
of the analyses. Those components that are most significant and uncertain are identified as
warranting additional investigation. This provides direct input to the site characterization and
design programs to assist in prioritizing the necessary testing to, in turn, develop more robust and
defensible performance assessments. 
<p>
Total system performance assessments evolve with time. As science and design information
matures, performance assessment analyses are revised to become more representative of the
expected conditions. Iterations of total system performance assessments of the Yucca Mountain
site and associated engineered barriers have been conducted in 1991, 1993, and 1995. Activities
supporting <em>Total System Performance Assessment</em>, a key component of the 1998 viability
assessment, are underway.
</h5><hr>
<p>
<strong>License Application Plan </strong><br>

The third component of the viability assessment is the license application plan, which will
identify the remaining scientific investigations and engineering information needed to complete a
license application. Our long-term goal of submitting a docketable license application to the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, should the Yucca Mountain site be found suitable, remains
central to the Program's mission. The preparation of the license application plan will also
provide an opportunity to assess the adequacy of our revised approach to site characterization and
design and the effectiveness of updates to the Program's regulatory framework. 
<p>
The license application plan will, in 1997, describe the additional information we believe is
needed to submit a docketable application for repository construction authorization to the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission. In developing the plan, we will draw on the available models
and data that describe the natural system, the repository and waste package designs, and the total
system performance assessment, together with the strategy for evaluating waste containment and
isolation. The plan will describe additional tests that will support the safety analysis for a
repository design and which will be completed before submittal of the license application. It will
also describe the performance confirmation program that will continue during repository
construction and operation, to further reduce the uncertainties in predicting the long-term
performance of the repository. The plan will also include a cost estimate for completing the
activities needed to prepare the license application.
<p>
<strong>Repository Cost and Schedule Estimates </strong><br>

The cost and schedule estimates for the repository system, the fourth component of the viability
assessment, will address completion of site characterization; performance confirmation; and
construction, operation, and closure of a potential repository at Yucca Mountain. The life-cycle
cost and schedule estimates will provide information for policy decisions regarding the feasibility
and rationale for continuing with licensing and construction of a geologic repository. 
The cost estimates will be based on the repository and waste package designs, and scientific
testing completed in 1998. We will use some design assumptions to augment the completed
designs. To reduce the uncertainties inherent in such assumptions, design activities will place an
emphasis on defining repository and engineered barrier system concepts and components that
significantly affect costs. 
<p>
<strong>Recommending a Repository Site to the President in 2001 and Submitting a Repository License
Application to the  Nuclear Regulatory Commission in 2002
</strong><br>
If the site is suitable, we will proceed with issuing the statutorily required Environmental Impact
Statement and Secretarial recommendation to the President in 2001. If the site is approved, we
plan to submit a license application to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in 2002.
<p>
<strong>Environmental Impact Statement </strong><br>
The Nuclear Waste Policy Act requires that a Final Environmental Impact Statement accompany
the Secretarial site recommendation and the license application. We began the Environmental
Impact Statement process by publishing a Notice of Intent in the <em>Federal Register</em>, which initiated
the public comment period on the proposed scope of the Environmental Impact Statement. As
part of the scoping effort, we conducted 15 public meetings across the nation. The public
comment period closed on December 5, 1995.
<p>
Because of the reduced funding in Fiscal Year 1996, we deferred further action on the
Environmental Impact Statement until Fiscal Year 1997. The Project schedule now calls for
publishing the Draft Environmental Impact Statement in 1999, and a Final Environmental Impact
Statement in 2000.
<p>
<strong>Site Recommendation </strong><br>
If the site is determined to be suitable with respect to the revised siting guidelines, a decision by
the Secretary of Energy to recommend the site is expected in 2001. We will publish a Notice of
Consideration to inform the public and announce a schedule for public hearings in the vicinity of
Yucca Mountain on the possible recommendation. After the hearings and prior to recommending
the site to the President, we will notify the State of Nevada about the decision to recommend the
site. The basis for this decision will include: (1) a description of the proposed repository,
including preliminary engineering specifications; (2) a description of the waste form or
packaging and an explanation of the relationship between the geologic environment and the
waste packages and waste forms; (3) a discussion of data obtained during site characterization
relating to the safety of the site; (4) the final Environmental Impact Statement; and (5)
preliminary comments by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission concerning the sufficiency of site
characterization. The site recommendation will also include the views and comments of the
Governor and State legislature, as well as other information the Secretary considers appropriate,
and any impact report submitted by the State of Nevada.
<p>
A Project Integrated Safety Assessment will be completed in 1999. This document will be
provided to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for preliminary comments on its sufficiency for
licensing. Section 114 of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act requires the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission's comments to address the extent to which at-depth site characterization analysis
and the waste form proposal seem to be sufficient for inclusion in a license application. 
<p>
<strong>License Application </strong><br>

To ensure that our activities prior to the viability assessment are consistent with our objective of
submitting a repository license application in 2002, we will continue interacting with the
Commission to receive feedback on the regulatory applicability and sufficiency of our work. We
will also continue to publish the semi-annual<em> Site Characterization Progress Reports</em>, as one
means of informing the Commission, and others, of our progress.
<p>
After completion of the viability assessment, we will prepare the additional information required
for the license application, such as an emergency response plan and a description of the quality
assurance program. A detailed description of our planned performance confirmation testing
program will also be prepared. The Project Integrated Safety Assessment will be used to develop
the license application. This additional information will result in a repository license application
that meets Nuclear Regulatory Commission requirements. 
<p>
In 1999, we will acquire a computer-based Licensing Support System designed to meet the
requirements of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's Licensing Support System Administrator
and to facilitate an efficient licensing review. The system will allow access to the comprehensive
documentation required for the licensing proceedings and will be certified by the Commission at
least six months before a license application is submitted.
<p>
<h4>2.1.2     Bases for the Revised Project Objectives</h4>
<p>
Progress in site characterization is enabling the Project to streamline and focus both technical and
regulatory elements of our plan to conduct site characterization. This progress is also a basis for
updating our strategy for evaluating waste containment and isolation. This section gives
examples of technical progress and discusses the updated strategy. <em>The box on the following
page outlines steps the Project has taken or will be taking to streamline and focus both technical
and regulatory elements.</em>
<p>
<strong>Progress in Characterizing the Yucca Mountain Site</strong><br>

Our progress in characterizing the Yucca Mountain site covers three areas: scientific programs,
construction and operation of the Exploratory Studies Facility, and engineering design.
<p>
<strong>Scientific Programs</strong><br>

Recent progress in the site characterization program has resulted in completion or near
completion of some investigations and increased confidence in the adequacy and significance of
other investigations. In the areas of groundwater flow and radionuclide transport, our models
have been made significantly more robust than earlier versions through the incorporation of new
data. In the area of geologic hazards, our work to bound the estimate of volcanic hazards is nearly
complete, and the field-based portion of seismic hazards investigations is also reaching
completion. These and other areas of progress are discussed below.
<p>
<em>Groundwater flow in the unsaturated zone</em>. Using isotopes such as carbon-14, tritium,
uranium-series, and chlorine-36, fracture-fill materials and pore water samples collected in the
Exploratory Studies Facility and from boreholes are being dated. This age dating is providing
data on water residence times and the times of past water movement through preferential
flowpaths. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that the residence times of pore water
currently in the potential repository horizon are generally long, on the order of tens of thousands
to hundreds of thousands of years.
<p>
The pneumatic monitoring program has improved our understanding of air flow through the
mountain and is providing data for calibrating the unsaturated zone flow model. The effects of
faults and stratigraphic contacts on air flow are being monitored and characterized. These data
are being compiled and used to calibrate the unsaturated zone flow model to match pressure
responses and constrain the bulk properties of major hydrologic units for controlling air flow.
Data collection by scientists working for Nye County, Nevada has provided important input to
this effort.
<p>
The unsaturated zone flow model has also been improved by advances in our understanding of
pore-scale processes in natural fractures, effective hydraulic conductivities of fracture networks,
and hysteresis of moisture-tension relations. These advances give us additional confidence in
modeling groundwater flow in fractures. Observations of moisture distributions, including
perched water occurrences, have been used to calibrate the unsaturated zone flow model. Zeolitic
zones in the Calico Hills geologic unit appear to control perched water occurrences along the
interface between the Calico Hills and Topopah Spring geologic units. This increase in our
understanding has led to a numerical flow model that credibly represents much of the hydrologic
data collected to date and is being used to focus additional work. 

<hr>
<h5>Streamlining and Focusing Technical and Regulatory Elements <p>
In response to Congressional direction and our progress in site characterization, we have revised
both the technical and regulatory elements of our strategy for completing site characterization,
determining the suitability of the Yucca Mountain site for a geologic repository, and preparing
and submitting a license application for construction authorization to the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission. Ways in which the technical and regulatory elements have been both streamlined
and focused are discussed below. 
<p>
Streamlining Technical Elements <br>
<ul>
<li>     Efficiencies and operating experience gained by actual tunnel boring machine  operations
have allowed us to accelerate Exploratory Studies Facility excavation. 
<li>     We have tied revisions of our site process models to key decision points, thereby reducing
the number of iterations and reports. 
<li>Instead of large, formal design reports for the repository and waste package, we will control and 
release elements of these designs as they progress. 
</ul><p>
Focusing Technical Elements <br>
<ul>
<li>We plan to emphasize data synthesis and documentation of what we have learned to date, in
order to conduct a smaller, more focused site data collection program. 
<li>We plan to focus documentation of our progress in integrated, rather than element- specific
reports, including total system performance assessment reports, peer reviews of our performance
assessment models, and a Project Integrated Safety Assessment. 
<li>We have developed a strategy to help us focus on early evaluation of those parts of the natural
barriers and engineering design that our performance assessment models tell us are most
significant to predicting waste containment and isolation in a  potential repository. 
</ul><p>
Streamlining Regulatory Elements <br>
<ul>
<li>We have reduced the number of times we plan to revise the license application annotated outline
and submit it to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for review. 
<li>We have reduced the number of topical reports we plan to prepare and submit to the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission for review. 
</ul><p>
Focusing Regulatory Elements <br>
<ul>
<li>We have focused our meetings with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission on areas where we can
make progress in resolving issues.
<li>We plan to use the authority granted by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act to revise the Department's 
siting guidelines (10 CFR Part 960). The revision will clarify our approach to evaluating the
suitability of the Yucca Mountain site. This approach will focus on the overall safety of the
repository system during operations and after  closure.
</ul></h5>
<hr>
<p>
<em>Radionuclide transport in the unsaturated zone.</em> Results from the unsaturated zone transport
model completed in Fiscal Year 1995 suggest that sorption and matrix diffusion may be effective
site-scale retardation mechanisms. Laboratory and modeling studies are providing a more robust
characterization of potential radionuclide transport at the site. Recent advances have allowed us
to reduce the number of radionuclides to a few key ones that are being studied in detail to
evaluate post-closure site performance. 
<p>
<em>Groundwater flow and radionuclide transport in the saturated zone.</em> Testing has been initiated at
the C-Hole complex to help characterize flow and transport in the saturated zone. Analysis of
transient pressure data from pumping tests has yielded local flow properties for the saturated
zone. Analysis of tracer breakthrough has provided an estimate of longitudinal dispersivity.
These data have been supplemented with hydraulic and geochemical data from aquifer tests from
other boreholes to support development of a repository-scale model of flow in the saturated zone. 
<p>
<em>Thermal effects.</em> A peer review team of independent scientists was organized to review the <em>in situ</em>
testing program that is planned to improve our understanding of coupled
thermal-hydrologic-chemical-mechanical processes. The peer review team is nearing completion
of its task. Based on the thermal-hydrologic-chemical-mechanical laboratory tests that we have
completed, and the peer review team recommendations, we have focused our plans for heater
tests that will be used to validate our current site-scale process models. 
<p>
<em>Volcanic hazards.</em> During the past two years, the Yucca Mountain Site Characterization Project
conducted an expert elicitation for a probabilistic volcanic hazard analysis. This was an
assessment, from a panel of expert earth scientists, of the probability of a volcanic event
disrupting the potential repository at Yucca Mountain. Additionally, the panel was asked to
quantify the uncertainties associated with their assessment. 
<p>
The probabilistic volcanic hazard analysis included four workshops and two field trips that
provided an opportunity for technical discussions and interactions, to ensure the panel had a
common understanding of the issues to be addressed. The panel was supplied with relevant data
gathered by the Project, as well as by the State of Nevada and by the Center for Nuclear Waste
Regulatory Analyses.
<p>
The final expert elicitation workshop was held during December 1995. While a wide variety of
approaches were used by the expert panel members, the panel's mean probability estimate of a
future volcanic event directly intersecting the repository was approximately 2.0 x10-8 events per
year, or about a 1 in 50,000,000 chance per year. The expert panel's estimate of probability is
virtually identical to that produced by Project scientists, suggesting that the volcanic hazard is
now well bounded by a wide range of scientific interpretations that yield reasonably consistent
and defensible results. 
<p>
<em>Seismic hazards. </em>Fieldwork to support the seismic hazards investigation is now reaching
completion. This work includes surface geologic mapping and construction of trenches across
potentially active faults to help estimate the magnitudes and recurrence intervals for earthquakes.
Data from these surface studies will be integrated with geophysical information to construct an
updated 3-D geologic framework model that will provide added confidence to our estimates of
seismic hazards. A probabilistic seismic hazard analysis, which will be conducted in Fiscal Year
1997, will be used to complete the evaluation of the potential hazard to the site from seismic
activity and to produce seismic design parameters for facilities to be constructed at Yucca
Mountain. 
<p>
To confirm our estimates of seismic hazards, the Project will continue to monitor seismic activity
in the Yucca Mountain area. Fifteen new digital seismic stations have been added to the Southern
Great Basin Seismic Network. These new stations are proving to be considerably more sensitive
than the older analog recording stations. The new stations allow us to record seismic events that
are well below the threshold for potential damage. Analysis of these small events increases our
understanding of the earthquake potential of the region.
<p>
<strong>Exploratory Studies Facility Construction and Operation</strong><br>
We have made significant progress in constructing the Exploratory Studies Facility. This
progress has permitted our scientists and engineers to begin direct observation and testing of
subsurface geologic and hydrologic conditions and of the engineering properties of the rock and
its response to construction activities. 
<p>
The north ramp starter tunnel was constructed with conventional (drill and blast) techniques and
was completed in September 1993. The remainder of the Exploratory Studies Facility has been
excavated using a tunnel boring machine. Four alcoves have been constructed in the north ramp
of the Exploratory Studies Facility, as described in <a href="./fig7.jpg"><em>Figure 7</em></a>, above. Excavation of the Upper
Tiva Canyon alcove (Alcove 1) was completed in December 1993. Excavation of the Bow Ridge
Fault alcove (Alcove 2) was completed in August 1995. Excavation of the Upper Paintbrush Tuff
Contact alcove (Alcove 3) was completed in August 1995. Excavation of Lower Paintbrush Tuff
Contact alcove (Alcove 4) was completed in October 1995. These alcoves have allowed the
scientific testing to proceed in the general area where waste would be emplaced in a potential
repository. A thermal testing alcove is under construction off the main Exploratory Studies
Facility tunnel. Excavation of that alcove will proceed far enough to place a single heater test in
1996. The remainder of the alcove will be constructed in 1997 for the much larger drift-scale
heater test. Two additional alcoves, called the north Ghost Dance fault and south Ghost Dance
fault alcoves, will be constructed off the Exploratory Studies Facility main tunnel to allow<em> in situ</em>
testing near the Ghost Dance fault. Both Ghost Dance fault alcoves are planned to be completed
in 1997, and the resulting testing results used to support the 1998 viability assessment. 
<p>
We are now more than half-way through the five-mile underground loop. We plan to complete
excavation of the south ramp back to the surface to finish the Exploratory Studies Facility
U-shaped, five-mile underground loop in 1997.
<p>

<h6>Design of the Exploratory Studies Facility. The Exploratory Studies Facility is providing scientists and engineers with the ability to observe underground geologic features that might affect repository and waste package design or repository performance. It is currently under construction, with progress well ahead of schedule. The completed facility will be a five-mile, U-shaped underground loop, 7.6 meters (25 feet) in diameter.</h6>
<p>
<strong>Engineering Design</strong><br>
The 1988 <em>Site Characterization Plan Conceptual Design Report</em> has served as the reference
design for the repository and waste package. The 1996 <em>Mined Geologic Disposal System
Advanced Conceptual Design Report</em> documents the current level of detail for the repository and
waste package. This report provides us with a new design, or a benchmark, based on the work
performed to date. The report describes the design process, depicts the major repository and
waste package configurations, components, and operational concepts, and identifies those areas
of the design requiring further refinement. Some significant changes from the 1988 <em>Conceptual
Design Report</em> include thermal loading and emplacement mode in the repository and the size,
capacity, and materials for the waste package. This new design report will serve as the initial
basis for the viability assessment design.
<p>
Information on design and performance parameters in this report were integrated with the
scientific investigations, systems engineering, and performance assessment elements. Particular
emphasis was placed on waste package handling and nuclear shielding requirements for worker
safety. 
<p>
<strong>Updating the Strategy for Evaluating Waste Containment and Isolation </strong>
<p>
<strong>Rationale for an Updated Strategy</strong><br>
The Project is in the process of updating its strategy for evaluating waste containment and
isolation for the Yucca Mountain site. The original strategy was described in the 1988 <em>Site
Characterization Plan</em>. Since that time, much has been learned about the site, as discussed above.
What has been learned leaves a relatively few, but important, technical questions about
significant features and processes of the natural geologic and hydrologic system that influence
the functioning of the engineered systems (especially the waste package) that would be part of a
potential Yucca Mountain repository. <em>The Program's strategy for evaluating the containment and
isolation of radioactive wastes at Yucca Mountain is described in the box on the following page.</em>
<p>
Progress in characterizing the Yucca Mountain site is occurring in parallel with progress in
defining the design of the engineered system. As engineered system concepts mature, testing of
selected materials under conditions that either mimic or bound expected conditions can also
become more focused. 
<p>
Finally, the 1992 Energy Policy Act directed the Environmental Protection Agency to promulgate
a site-specific radiation protection standard for Yucca Mountain. This standard is currently being
developed and early indications are that it will be a health-based standard, likely requiring dose
calculations to a critical group. To address this type of standard, modeling of the saturated zone
and the biosphere needs to be enhanced over the types of models we have used to address the
previously applicable release based standard.
<p>
Three developments have contributed to the need to update the strategy for evaluating waste
containment and isolation: (1) new site characterization information; (2) updated repository and
waste package conceptual designs; and (3) considerations related to the change from a release
standard to a dose or risk-based standard, with an as yet unspecified regulatory time frame.

<h5>Strategy for Evaluating Waste Containment and Isolation For The Yucca Mountain Site<p>
The Program's strategy for evaluating the containment and isolation of radioactive wastes relies
on engineered barriers, geologic features, and natural processes to delay and minimize releases of
radionuclides to the environment outside of the Yucca Mountain site and to minimize any
exposure to the public. The strategy is based on the observation that there is very little available
water in the rocks in and around the repository to dissolve radionuclides and transport them to
the accessible environment.
<p>
<em>Engineered Barriers. </em>Waste arriving at the repository site will be placed in a special disposal
container, or waste package, consisting of multiple metal barriers designed to contain the wastes
by resisting corrosion for thousands of years. A backfill of crushed rock around the waste
packages, an example of another engineered barrier, is being evaluated with the intent that it may
be used to limit water contact with the packages, further delaying corrosion and, following
corrosion, to limit dissolution and transport of radionuclides. The heat output of the waste will
dry the rock, decreasing relative humidity and thus delaying corrosion of the disposal packages,
while the major portion of hazardous radionuclides decay to background levels.
<p>
<em>Geologic Features and Natural Processes. </em>The repository's long-term behavior, following
corrosion of the waste packages and transport of radionuclides from the engineered barrier, will
be controlled by geologic features and natural processes. Water movement through the repository
level, which could lead to dissolution and transport of radionuclides, is the most important
feature for determining the long-term behavior of the potential repository. Based on observations
of generally dry conditions in the Exploratory Studies Facility and preliminary analyses of age
dates of water from the rock pores at the potential repository level and of mineral coatings
deposited by water flowing along fractures, we believe today's dry conditions are likely to persist
in the future. Mathematical models developed to characterize gas and fluid flow at Yucca
Mountain predict that water movement will continue to be slow in the future even with potential
changes in climatic and hydrologic conditions. Some of the radionuclides that are released from
corroded waste packages will be delayed as they move through the rocks below the repository
horizon. Radionuclides that reach the water table will mix with flowing groundwater and be
diluted.
<p>
<em>Doses to the Public. </em>We have defined isolation with a system-level safety goal as "an acceptable
dose to a member of the public living near the site." The project will report quantitative dose
modeling results. More attention will be paid to evaluating potential doses for the first ten
thousand years. However, evaluations will, qualitatively, be carried out over longer times in order
to provide insight into peak dose potential and to support system enhancement studies.
</h5><hr>
<p>
<strong>Concepts and Status of the Updated Strategy</strong><br>
The Project's updated strategy for waste containment and isolation for a potential repository at
the Yucca Mountain site will maintain the core strategy of the 1988 <em>Site Characterization Plan</em>:
the Yucca Mountain site, at potential repository depth, is approximately 1000 feet above the
water table and experiences very low rates of water infiltration from the surface. This site
characteristic is the first line of defense against the corrosion of waste packages and the release of
radionuclides from breached waste packages in the potential repository (leading to loss of
containment). Secondary lines of defense to enhance containment and isolation lie in potential
engineered barriers adjacent to the waste package and in the geochemical environment provided
by the natural system, which suggests considerable sorption will exist along potential flow paths
for many radionuclide species that could eventually be released from the waste package.
The updated strategy currently being developed maintains a number of fundamentals of the
original strategy. The updated strategy continues to recognize the important role of the relatively
"dry" conditions at Yucca Mountain, which contributed to the site originally being selected for
characterization studies. The updated strategy also continues to recognize the geochemical setting
provided by Yucca Mountain as important to determining the rate at which radionuclides may be
released into the environment in the future, when containment by the engineered barriers is
eventually lost.
<p>
However, this update differs from the original strategy for four reasons. First, because much has
been learned since 1988, there is an opportunity to focus resources on the remaining technical
questions that have been demonstrated, through total system performance assessments, to be
important to waste containment and isolation. Second, to make an evaluation of the viability of
committing further resources to the licensing process for Yucca Mountain, there is a need to
make this appraisal independent of evolving specific regulations. Third, the strategy update
incorporates an enhanced engineered system design that more effectively complements important
features of the natural system. Finally, the updated strategy reflects the revised schedule and
recognizes the need for a sufficient technical basis to support the viability assessment in 1998
and the license application in 2002. 
<p>
In order to support the societal decision that needs to be made on geologic disposal, the Project is
defining waste containment and isolation for purposes of conducting the viability assessment. We
have defined waste containment as the "near-complete containment of radionuclides by waste
packages for several thousands of years." We have defined isolation with a system-level safety
goal as "an acceptable dose to a member of the public living near the site." Quantitative dose
modeling results will be reported by the Project. More attention will be paid to evaluating
potential doses for the first ten thousand years. However, evaluations will qualitatively be carried
out over longer times in order to provide insight into peak dose potential and to support system
enhancement studies.
<p>
The technical questions identified in recent total system performance assessments as key to
evaluating repository and waste package performance are related to the following key attributes
of the system:
<p>
1.   rate of water seepage into the repository;<br>
2.   integrity of waste packages (containment);<br>
3.   rate of release of radionuclides from waste in the breached waste packages;<br>
4.   radionuclide transport through engineered barriers and natural barriers; and<br>
5.   dilution in the groundwater below the repository.<br>
<p>
The strategy will include more detail as to what we now understand about these five attributes, as
well as what our approach is to gathering data and developing models to make better predictions
of these attributes over time. As the repository generates heat and then gradually returns to
ambient temperatures, it is expected that at least the first four of these attributes will be affected,
changing their relative importance to system performance as a function of time.
<p>
The strategy will guide our plans for a viability assessment in 1998, but also looks forward to and
beyond the license application. We will continue to conduct scientific and engineering studies to
aid us in confirming or revising the basis for modeling performance of the repository system.
This Program Plan indicates our expectation to have more information available for a license
application. It also recognizes that, if a license is granted, confirmatory technical work will
continue beyond the license application during the construction and operational phases of the
repository.
<p>
<h4>2.1.3     Key Technical Activities Supporting the Revised Project Objectives</h4>
<p>
To support the work for the viability assessment and continuing through license application, we
are concentrating our activities into four integrated areas: (1) core science; (2) Exploratory
Studies Facility construction and operation; (3) engineering design; and (4) performance
assessment.
<p>
In addition to these four areas, environmental activities are ongoing. The Project will continue to
comply with all applicable statutes and regulations. For example, the Project operates under
several permits that are designed to protect natural and cultural resources and complies with air
quality permits, water quality permits, and other such permits issued by the State of Nevada. 
<p>
National Environmental Policy Act compliance activities will be resumed in Fiscal Year 1997
with the award of a contract for preparation of the Environmental Impact Statement. These
activities include reviewing and responding to public scoping comments and data gathering and
impact analyses. These activities will lead to development and issuance of a Draft Environmental
Impact Statement, followed by a public hearing period and a Final Environmental Impact
Statement, and a Record of Decision.
<p>
<strong>Core Science Activities </strong><br>
Scientific testing will continue to support model development, design, performance assessment,
and performance confirmation.<em> In situ </em>testing in the Exploratory Studies Facility and related
laboratory tests will be emphasized. Crucial initial results from Exploratory Studies Facility
testing will be available for incorporation into process models being developed in support of the
total system performance assessment for viability assessment. 
<p>
A principal near-term objective of the core science program is to complete the hydrologic flow
and radionuclide transport models that will support the performance assessment calculations for
the viability assessment. The Project will analyze and synthesize the existing data gathered over
the past decade to confirm or modify the conceptual and mathematical models that are used to
support performance assessment calculations. This effort will help narrow the probable range of
effects on repository performance from such key factors as water infiltration through the
repository, release and transport of radionuclides from the waste package to the saturated zone,
dilution of any radionuclide releases, and the degree of drying in the repository from
waste-generated heat.
<p>
The core science program will also identify which data sets or modeling efforts are sufficiently
complete to support a future license application and areas where additional information is
needed. This work will serve as a basis to delineate the testing and performance confirmation
programs to be described in the license application plan.
<p>
We will complete four major types of models in Fiscal Year 1997 to a level of sufficient maturity
to support a comprehensive site description, which will include geologic, hydrologic,
geochemical, and climatological processes, and to support the total system performance
assessment for the viability assessment. We will confirm the sufficiency of these models for
license application with the additional data that will be available in Fiscal Year 1999. Site-scale
flow models will describe groundwater flow above and below the water table. These models will
characterize the movement of gas and fluid through Yucca Mountain and will be used to predict
their future behavior. Site-scale and regional-scale transport models will evaluate potential
radionuclide releases to the accessible environment. The transport models use the results of the
flow models and add the chemical interactions between the rock units below the repository
horizon and potential radionuclide releases. The geologic framework model will present the
distribution of rock units and geologic structures, such as faults, at the site. This basic geologic
information is the foundation for the hydrologic flow and transport models. Climate models will
evaluate potential future climate changes. We will use the results of these modeling efforts to
prescribe bounding values of precipitation for the flow models. 
<p>
The core science activities that will support completion of these four types of models include:
<p>
<ul>
<li><em>Testing and modeling groundwater flow above the water table</em>, to understand the
hydrology in the unsaturated zone where the potential repository horizon is located. The testing
activities in the unsaturated zone are directed primarily at evaluating the amounts and rates of
water moving through the rocks in and around the potential repository and at measuring
hydrologic parameters required to develop and calibrate the numerical flow models of vapor and
fluid flow. Continued monitoring of gas pressure, temperature, and water pressure in
surface-based boreholes will provide some of these hydrologic parameters. Testing in boreholes
drilled in alcoves in the Exploratory Studies Facility will continue to provide pneumatic and
hydrologic data on the effects of faults and boundaries between different rock units on water
movement within the unsaturated zone. The hydrologic testing in the Ghost Dance fault alcoves
will begin in Fiscal Year 1997 and end in Fiscal Year 1999. We will continue to use several
different techniques of isotopic dating of water samples collected from rocks in the Exploratory
Studies Facility to evaluate the length of time that the water has resided in the rock. Isotopic
dating techniques will also continue to be used on loose material in faults to determine the past
history of water movement through potential flowpaths along faults. 
<p>
<li>  <em> Testing and modeling groundwater flow below the water table</em>, to understand the
hydrology in the saturated zone. Testing in the saturated zone is focused on determining the
capability of the groundwater flow system to dilute and disperse dissolved radionuclides and to
provide hydrologic data for input to flow models for the saturated zone. Hydraulic and tracer
testing will continue at a complex of three test wells east of the Yucca Mountain site, and
hydraulic testing is being conducted in a well north of the site to collect hydrologic flow data. 
<p>
<li><em>Radionuclide transport modeling,</em> to integrate what is known about the flow of water, the
effects of waste-generated heat, and the geology of Yucca Mountain with laboratory
measurements of geochemical processes. Laboratory work, hydrologic model development, and
field work to support the development of this modeling have been progressing for some time. To
complement the integrated three-dimensional model for unsaturated zone transport at Yucca
Mountain that we produced in Fiscal Year 1995, we will develop the first model for saturated
zone transport in Fiscal Year 1996. In addition, we are updating the unsaturated zone transport
model to incorporate better defined radionuclide source terms, to incorporate a better calibrated
flow model, to consider additional types of radionuclides, and to include additional physical
processes that affect transport. Laboratory studies are underway to support the modeling and
provide additional confidence in performance assessments. These studies have been prioritized to
maximize our efforts on processes that are most important to waste isolation. In Fiscal Year
1997, we will conduct a limited number of field and laboratory studies and converge on robust
transport models to support performance assessment.
<p>
<li><em> Bounding the radionuclide release rates,</em> to determine defensible values for releases of
different radionuclides as a function of time from the waste packages and other components of
the engineered barrier system. This work involves laboratory experiments, observations and tests
in the Exploratory Studies Facility, and modeling to assess the effects of the thermal pulse from
waste-generated heat on the chemical interaction of introduced materials, such as grout or
backfill, with ground water and rock on transport of radionuclides. Of particular interest for
corrosion and radionuclide transport processes is the temporal and spatial distribution of water
contacting the waste packages and the humidity of the surrounding air. We will obtain
experimental data on these attributes for the rocks at Yucca Mountain to provide realistic
constraints on the models used to predict performance during the time there is high heat output
from the emplaced waste as well as afterwards. Thermal testing in the Exploratory Studies
Facility is one part of this effort. In Fiscal Year 1997, we will develop repository-scale models
based on available laboratory data and initial thermal test results. Laboratory experiments will be
substantially completed in Fiscal Year 1998. These data and results from  in situ thermal tests
will be used to update the repository-scale models to support the license application.
<p>
<li><em>Geologic investigations and synthesis, </em>to complete the description of the geologic
framework and an assessment of volcanic and seismic hazards for Yucca Mountain. In Fiscal
Year 1996, surface-based geologic mapping of the repository block will be completed and
fracture data from surface and underground mapping will be synthesized, and we will update the
preliminary three-dimensional geologic framework model. In Fiscal Year 1997, we will complete
the three-dimensional geologic model for Yucca Mountain with associated information on the
distribution of rock properties, mineral occurrences, and results from geophysical surveys of
subsurface features. We will also complete an assessment of potential natural resources in the
vicinity of Yucca Mountain. Assessments of volcanic and seismic hazards will be completed in
Fiscal Year 1996 and Fiscal Year 1998, respectively. Geological mapping of the Exploratory
Studies Facility will continue as excavation progresses. Surface geologic maps will be
completed.
<p>
<li> <em>Surface-based drilling activities, </em>which are used to obtain subsurface data both within and
outside of the repository area. In Fiscal Year 1996, we completed drilling one additional borehole
to complement the existing suite of approximately 40 boreholes drilled since 1992, when our
quality assurance program was approved, and another 40 boreholes drilled earlier. In addition to
providing rock and water samples, drilling activities allow data collection and analysis of air flow
through Yucca Mountain. Installation of pneumatic instrumentation into three boreholes in Fiscal
Year 1996, together with data from instrumentation already installed in four boreholes during
Fiscal Year 1995, will support models of air flow to predict the behavior of water vapor and
gaseous radionuclides in response to heat from the emplaced wastes. Future activities will focus
on data needed to improve our understanding of the saturated zone flow system.
<p>
<li><em>Climate modeling,</em> to predict future climate conditions in the Yucca Mountain region for
evaluating possible future rates of water infiltration into the unsaturated zone and of recharge to
the regional ground water system. The climate model predictions for a number of possible future
climate scenarios will be developed in Fiscal Year 1997, and used by the flow and transport
models producing a range of infiltration and recharge values to assess the effects of possible
future climatic extremes on waste containment and isolation. 
<p>
<li> <em>   Thermal testing,</em> to examine the effects of the introduction of heat generated by
radioactive decay in the wastes, which should evaporate a large amount of water from the rocks
around the repository level at Yucca Mountain. The role of this water, if it condenses, is a major
uncertainty in assessing repository performance, and a series of experiments will be conducted to
help determine the effects of the water vapor and any condensed water. In addition to evaporation
and condensation, geochemical and geomechanical processes may also have long-term effects on
the amount and composition of water entering and leaving the rocks near the waste package.
Experiments will be performed in the Exploratory Studies Facility, beginning in Fiscal Year
1996, to help bound the effects of the thermal pulse. Measurements will include temperature,
relative humidity, gas pressure, water chemistry, moisture content, and other appropriate
variables to determine the thermal, hydrological, geochemical, and geomechanical responses of
the tunnel and surrounding rocks, representative backfill materials, and potential waste package
materials, to heating and cooling over a temperature range likely to be encountered during the life
cycle of a repository. Confirmation of near-field environment models is necessary for engineered
materials selection, repository design, estimation of waste package failure rates, and
determination of the possible radionuclide releases for performance assessment calculations. The
results from the thermal testing will be used to support completion of the near-field environment
models in Fiscal Year 1998, and will be used in Fiscal Year 2000 to confirm their sufficiency for
license application.
</ul>
<p>
We will continue other monitoring activities in order to obtain the baseline data required for
licensing. These activities include operation of a seismic network to locate and characterize
earthquakes, pneumatic and water-level monitoring in selected boreholes, meteorologic and
surface water flow measurements, and construction monitoring in the Exploratory Studies
Facility. We will analyze data from these activities for significant anomalies and enter them in
technical data bases, where they will be available for use in design activities. Monitoring
activities and data collection to support environmental compliance are also continuing and will
be integrated with data needs for core science and performance assessment.
<p>
The Project also conducts scientific and engineering reviews of hazardous and solid waste
handling and Exploratory Studies Facility designs to ensure compliance with environmental
regulations and requirements. Additionally, the Project gathers data and reports on ambient air
monitoring data and preconstruction surveys to identify and characterize biological and cultural
resources. Finally, the Project prepares data synthesis reports for radiological and terrestrial
ecosystems field monitoring.
<p>
After completion of the viability assessment, we will continue long-term testing and monitoring
activities to confirm performance estimates for both the natural system and the engineered barrier
system. Of particular interest is waste package material corrosion behavior as well as that of the
waste form itself. <em>In situ</em> thermal testing will continue in the Exploratory Studies Facility with the
long heat-up and cool-down times required to properly simulate expected waste package
behavior. Environmental monitoring will continue to support final radiological safety
assessments for the period of operations as well as other requirements of the Environmental
Impact Statement.
<p>
<strong>Exploratory Studies Facility Construction and Operation Activities</strong><br>
The Project will continue construction of the Exploratory Studies Facility using the tunnel boring
machine. In Fiscal Year 1996, we plan to complete excavation of the main drift portion of the
Exploratory Studies Facility at the repository level, which will allow observation and testing of
the geology and hydrology along the north-south length of the potential repository. We initiated
excavation of two alcoves in Fiscal Year 1996. One will be used for conducting thermal tests to
study the response of the groundwater and rocks to heat that will be generated by the wastes. A
single heater test in the initial part of this alcove is scheduled to begin in Fiscal Year 1996 and
end in Fiscal Year 1998. The much larger drift scale heater test in the back part of this alcove
will be started in Fiscal Year 1997, with heat-up to be complete in Fiscal Year 1999. The other
new alcove will provide access near the Ghost Dance fault to study its hydrologic characteristics
and to determine if this fault acts as a preferential path of water flow through the repository. 
<p>
In Fiscal Year 1997, we will complete excavation of the south ramp back to the surface. This will
complete the U-shaped, five-mile underground loop. We will complete excavation of the first
(north) Ghost Dance fault alcove through the fault and also construct a second alcove through the
Ghost Dance fault at the south end of the repository area. Exploratory Studies Facility activities
will continue, including maintenance of the ground support systems and operation and
maintenance of support utilities. If deemed necessary, we will excavate an east-west drift, off the
main tunnel, to allow observation and testing across the width of the proposed repository. This
access (the exact location is not yet determined) could provide additional confirmation that site
conditions are suitable and that the emplacement tunnel layout and ground support concepts are
feasible. If this work is determined to be needed, we plan to start excavation in Fiscal Year 1999,
or earlier, if funding permits.
<p>
The Project continues to ensure the protection of employees, members of the public, the
environment, and site facilities and equipment from hazards that may result from site
characterization and construction activities. The Project also provides underground safety support
and on-site safety support to construction; provides environmental support for operating
hazardous waste accumulation facilities and managing hydrocarbon contaminated soil
maintenance and disposal; and conducts surveillance of site activities to ensure compliance with
environmental regulations and requirements. Additionally, the Project maintains medical
emergency services and fire prevention programs to support field activities, continued
implementation of the safety and health program, and the emergency management program.
<p>
<strong>Engineering Design Activities </strong><br>
The design of the repository will be heavily dependent upon and closely integrated with
performance assessment and core science activities. Coordination with performance assessment
is needed to determine the adequacy of designs, performance margins for safety and isolation,
and to make necessary design modifications. Coordination with core science activities will
ensure the availability of adequate site data to support the designs. Design will also depend on
the results of materials and waste form corrosion and performance testing.
<p>
In Fiscal Year 1996, we documented the advanced conceptual designs for the repository and
waste package in the <em>Mined Geologic Disposal System Advanced Conceptual Design Report</em>.
The report describes the design process, depicts the major repository and waste package
configurations, components, and operational concepts, and identifies those areas of the design
requiring further refinement. The design in this report will serve as the initial basis for the
viability assessment design. 
<p>
For the repository above-ground area, the design for the viability assessment and the cost
estimate will include a description of the site area and the major surface facilities, including the
waste handling building. For the subsurface area, the design will describe the subsurface region,
layout and stability considerations for tunnels, ventilation, concepts for possible retrieval of
wastes, and other operational considerations. The subsurface design will provide an estimate of
the waste capacity of the repository.
<p>
The effects of the form and quantity of the wastes will be addressed by establishing bounding
values for their important characteristics, such as amount of radiation, decay heat, and
degradation behavior including radionuclide release. We will use these bounds as a basis for
designs and operating concepts. Studies will be conducted to enhance spent fuel basket designs,
to finalize waste package materials selection, and to establish feasibility of waste package
fabrication techniques. A disposal criticality analysis methodology will be developed and
documented in a technical report in Fiscal Year 1996. We will prepare a disposal criticality
topical report, which we will submit to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, in Fiscal Year 1998.
<p>
Repository design activities in the near term will concentrate on resolving subsurface-related
repository issues. The surface facilities design, which can rely on a higher level of regulatory and
technical precedent in the commercial nuclear industry, will be developed later. The new design
activities will examine the assumptions made in the 1996 design report and address key
uncertainties that affect repository performance and cost, such as thermal effects and corrosion. 
<p>
Some specific engineering studies planned to support these designs are summarized below:
<p>
<ul> 
<li><em>A thermal management study </em>will provide the detailed analysis that will support a thermal
loading decision. The effort will provide an evaluation of thermal management concepts such as
a multi-level repository, oldest fuel first, ventilation, selective emplacement, and aging, with the
objectives of identifying thermal management options that should be pursued during design. The
effort will examine a reference thermal load in the high range of 80-100 metric tons of uranium
per acre, which would accommodate the full statutory limit (i.e., 70,000 metric tons) of wastes
for the repository within the planned area. 
<p>
<li><em>Evaluation of backfill</em> will provide a technical basis for a recommendation on whether an
additional engineered barrier system element, such as backfill or other concepts that perform
similar functions, should be incorporated into the system design, and if so, describe alternative
approaches. This study will discuss the design, operational, and cost considerations related to
backfill and other potential supplemental engineered barriers, testing requirements to address
uncertainties, and potential effects on performance.
<p>
<li><em>Evaluation of corrosion and degradation</em> of waste package materials and waste forms.
Short- and long-term degradation and dissolution testing of selected waste forms continued in
Fiscal Year 1996. Short-term testing of waste package materials continued and long-term testing
of container materials began in Fiscal Year 1996. Short- term results will be available before the
1998 viability assessment; the long-term results will contribute to a site recommendation, license
application, and confirmatory testing during repository construction and operation. Alternative
designs and materials will be further evaluated to ensure that they meet the regulatory
requirements, are licensable, and are deployable at a reasonable cost. 
<p>
<li><em>Analysis of safeguard and security requirements. </em>This study will consist of analyses to
assess possible threats and vulnerability to determine safeguards and security requirements for
material control and accounting and physical protection, such as security lighting, surveillance,
and intrusion detection equipment.
</ul><p>
Specific activities to develop design detail to support the 1998 total system performance
assessment and the cost and schedule estimates for viability assessment include:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Refining the concept of operations for repository subsurface and surface activities,
including assessments of reasonably available technologies.
<li>Continuing to develop the repository and engineered barrier designs to accommodate the
requirements and enhance concepts established during the advanced conceptual design, including
preliminary evaluations, material selections, and drawings of elements of design that are
important to safety or waste isolation.
<li>Evaluating feasibility of the design of components of the engineered barrier system.
<li>Conducting safety assessments for the operational period, including analyses of credible accident scenarios and provisions to keep radioactive releases as low as reasonably achievable.
<li>Developing a preliminary design and strategy for demonstrating waste retrieval.
<li>Preparing a general description of the proposed transporters for moving waste packages
underground.
<li>Preparing preliminary designs for sealing tunnels and shafts for final closure.
<li>Evaluating the stability of the tunnels during the period of operations and after closure as
affected by seismic, thermal, and normal rock stresses.
<li>Describing the general arrangements of non-nuclear surface facility designs to develop a more precise cost estimate.
</ul>
<p>
After the viability assessment, design activities will accomplish several objectives: identification
of a complete concept of operations; demonstration of compliance with codes, standards and
regulatory requirements; resolution of design issues for items with little or no regulatory
precedents; assessment of design alternatives to bound environmental impacts; and support of
potential licensing technical reports. License application design will support detailed safety
assessments and accident analyses, and will describe designs in enough detail to demonstrate
repository safety and enable compliance reviews by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. 
<p>
Additional design activities, building on the design products for the viability assessment, will
provide an adequate level of detail to support a license application. We will complete more
definitive designs for all elements of the repository and engineered barrier system that are
important to safety or waste isolation. Components for these important elements that have not
been proven will receive more detail, including extensive calculations and technical
specifications, than those that have been proven. Elements that are not important to waste
containment or isolation will be addressed only through a preliminary level of detail. In addition,
we will complete a description of the Nevada transportation infrastructure necessary to support
facility operations, as part of the development of the Environmental Impact Statement.
<p>
<strong>Key Performance Assessment Activities </strong><br>

Based on <em>Total System Performance Assessment - 1995, </em>we will complete additional sensitivity
analyses in Fiscal Year 1996 to improve our evaluation of the significance to total system
performance of various components of the natural and engineered barriers. These analyses will
be used to refine the strategy for evaluating waste containment and isolation and to narrow the
scope of our site characterization and design work by identifying the additional important site
and design-related information required for performance assessments for the viability assessment
and license application.
<p>
To support engineering design activities in addressing the major technical questions, we will
continue analyzing the hydrological and thermal effects of waste-generated heat and backfill on
the waste package. In addition, we will use improved data to refine models of waste package
material degradation and waste dissolution to evaluate potential releases of radionuclides. 
<p>
In 1998, the Project will complete another total system performance assessment. This
performance assessment will build on previous iterations by using more complete models of the
natural and engineered barriers than those in previous performance assessments. The Project is
investigating models of potential biosphere pathways of radionuclides that may be released from
the repository. We are also developing criteria and parameter validity tests and uncertainty
analyses to use in selecting appropriate models for performance assessment.
<p>
A phased peer review of this performance assessment will be conducted. The review will occur
in steps, beginning in Fiscal Year 1996 and finishing in Fiscal Year 1999. It will include the
models of physical processes in 1996-1998, the abstractions of these models as used for
performance assessment in 1998-1999, and the total system performance assessment itself in
1999. The comments and recommendations available from each step of the peer review will be
incorporated, as appropriate, as the total system performance assessment is developed for the
viability assessment. The comments and recommendations that are not received in time for the
viability assessment will be incorporated into the total system performance assessment for the
suitability recommendation and the license application.
<p>
The 1998 total system performance assessment will be subjected to sensitivity analyses to refine
our strategy for evaluation of waste containment and isolation and to identify areas where the
level of uncertainty needs reduction for the license application. Those analyses will also evaluate
the latest results of thermal and materials testing to verify that performance is within
expectations. Performance assessment will help define the performance confirmation testing
program by identifying testing needs. The total system performance assessment input for the
license application will respond to the final peer review of the 1998 total system performance
assessment. Additional peer review may be performed if there are substantial changes in the total
system performance assessment submitted for the license application.
<p>
<h4>2.1.4     Key Management Activities</h4><p>
Management activities have also been affected by funding reductions subsequent to the 1994
Program Plan. We are maintaining the necessary level of support to continue our key activities,
to ensure health and safety, and to fulfill our public participation responsibilities, while managing
our resources in a fiscally responsible manner.
<p>
<strong>Project Management Activities</strong><br>

Project management functions include planning, budgeting, scheduling and managing funds of
all Project elements, provision of facilities, administrative support services, telecommunications,
records management and computer procurement and maintenance, operations and maintenance of
wide area and local area networks, and motor pool operations. Project management functions
also include cost and schedule baseline management and change control. Administration of the
funds for financial and technical assistance to the State of Nevada, Affected Units of Local
Government and Nevada universities, for the National Academy of Sciences, and for
Payments-Equal-to-Taxes is also a Project management function. 
<p>
<strong>Site Management Activities</strong><br>

An additional management function is the provision of site services at the Yucca Mountain site.
These services include: emergency services such as fire protection; security services such as site
access and property protection; transportation services including bus service to and from the
Yucca Mountain site for employees, tour buses, and the on-site motor pool; communication
services including the radio network link for workers in the field and communications to the
Exploratory Studies Facility; and utility services such as power, water, and sanitation facilities. 
<p>
<strong>Management of Institutional Activities</strong><br>

Institutional activities in Fiscal Year 1996 will center around informing stakeholders and the
public about our revised program strategy. Major opportunities for formal public involvement
will include the rulemaking process to revise our repository siting guidelines, the issuance of the
Draft Environmental Impact Statement, and public hearings prior to the site recommendation.
<p>
The Project will continue to respond to information requests from the Congress and  media. The
Project will rely heavily on the new Yucca Mountain Internet Home Page to continue
communication with interested groups and individuals in a cost-effective manner. Consistent
with the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, we will continue to propose funding for the State of Nevada
and Affected Units of Local Government oversight activities associated with site
characterization. Program review meetings will continue to remain open to the public.
<p>
Fiscal Year 1996 funding has forced a sharp reduction in institutional activities. We are reducing
participation in national meetings and conferences and terminating exhibitions at national events;
reducing the production of information materials such as videos, photographs, and printed
material; implementing a 50 percent reduction in education staff and events and an 86 percent
reduction for educational materials; decreasing the hours of operation of our science centers and
the toll-free information number; significantly reducing interactions with the State of Nevada, the
Affected Units of Local Government, Native American tribes, and other government entities;
deferring the creation of a site-specific advisory board; and implementing a 50 percent reduction
in the number of national stakeholder meetings.

<h2>Appendix A<br>
Evolution of the Civilian Radioactive Waste Management Program</h2>
<hr>
<em>Appendix A </em>describes the genesis of this Nation's efforts to resolve the radioactive waste
management problem, the development of an international consensus on geologic disposal, the
key provisions of and revisions to the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, and the oversight and
system components of the Civilian Radioactive Waste Management Program.
<p>
<h4>Development of Radioactive Waste Management Policy
</h4><p>
<strong>United States' Efforts Begin</strong><br>
The strategy of geologic disposal for the long-term isolation of spent nuclear fuel and high-level
radioactive waste dates back several decades. In the mid-1950s, the National Academy of
Sciences considered the disposal of defense-related high-level radioactive waste. In 1957, the
Academy concluded that radioactive wastes could be disposed of safely in a variety of geologic
media within the United States. The Academy noted, however, the technical and institutional
uncertainties involved in implementing a geologic repository strategy, and assumed that
significant research would be necessary and substantial costs incurred before a final conclusion
could be reached on the feasibility, reliability, and safety of geologic disposal. At the same time,
the nationwide screening for suitable repository sites began and continued through the early
1980s.
<p>
<strong>International Consensus on Geologic Disposal</strong><br>

In parallel with the evolution of the United States' policy, geologic disposal also emerged as the
international community's consensus strategy for managing the permanent disposal of highly
radioactive wastes.
<p>
In 1985, the Nuclear Energy Agency of the Organization of Economic Cooperation and
Development,  an international organization of 23 countries (including the United States)
cooperating in the development of peaceful uses of nuclear energy, reported a high degree of
confidence worldwide that disposal systems in deep geologic structures can be designed and
operated safely to assure long-term isolation of spent nuclear fuel or high-level radioactive waste.
In 1995, the Nuclear Energy Agency reaffirmed the international consensus in its report <em>The
Environmental and Ethical Basis of Geologic Disposal: A Collective Opinion of the Radioactive
Waste Management Committee of the OECD.</em> The Agency asserted that:
<p>
<em>". . . our responsibilities to future generations are better discharged by a strategy of final disposal
than by reliance on stores which require surveillance, bequeath long-term responsibilities of care,
and may in due course be neglected by future societies whose structural stability should not be
presumed."
</em>
<p>
<strong>Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982
</strong><br>
In 1982, Congress passed the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, which established the Office of Civilian
Radioactive Waste Management within the Department of Energy. The Act adopted geologic
disposal as the Nation's long-term strategy for the safe isolation of radioactive waste and
confirmed the Federal Governments responsibility for managing and disposing of commercial
spent nuclear fuel. The Act directed the Department to identify three potential sites for the first
repository and to conduct a multi-year evaluation, known as site characterization, of each of the
three sites. This provision was later amended to terminate  site characterization at all sites except
the Yucca Mountain site in Nevada.
<p>
Following site characterization, the Secretary of Energy may decide to recommend a site for
development as a repository. If the President accepts the Secretary's recommendation, the Act
directs the President to submit a recommendation of the site to Congress. The site designation
becomes effective 60 days after the President's recommendation, unless in the interim a notice of
disapproval is submitted by the Governor and legislature of the State in which the site is located,
or by the governing body of an Indian tribe on whose reservation the site is located. If such a
notice is submitted, the site would be disapproved unless within 90 days of the submittal
Congress passes a resolution of siting approval. If the President recommends a site and it is not
disapproved, the Act directs the Department to submit an application to the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission for a license authorizing repository construction. If the application is approved and
construction proceeds, the Act requires the Department to apply to the Commission for additional
licensing authority to begin accepting waste into the repository, and ultimately to close the
facility permanently when waste emplacement is completed.
<p>
The Act limits the quantity of waste to be stored in the first repository to 70,000 metric tons of
heavy metal until a second repository is in operation. The Act provides for the disposal of
defense-related high-level radioactive waste, contingent upon a Presidential determination that
such waste could be disposed of in a geologic repository along with commercial waste. In 1985,
the President found no basis to conclude that a defense-only repository was required, and
therefore, under provisions of the Act, the Department is to proceed with plans and actions to
dispose of defense waste with commercial spent nuclear fuel in a single repository.
<p>
The Act directs that activities associated with the management and disposal of civilian spent fuel
conducted under the Act be funded through a fee on the commercial generation of nuclear power.
The fee was set initially at 1.0 mil per kilowatt-hour, to be deposited into the Nuclear Waste
Fund. The Secretary of Energy is directed to review the fee amount annually to determine its
adequacy to meet Federal Government costs of managing civilian spent fuel, and to propose
adjustments as needed to ensure full cost recovery. Costs associated with the disposal of
high-level radioactive waste from defense activities are to be paid by the Federal Government.
<p>
The Act authorized the Secretary to enter into contracts with utilities for the acceptance and
disposal of spent nuclear fuel. These contracts, which came to be known as the Standard
Contracts for Disposal of Spent Nuclear Fuel and/or High-Level Radioactive Waste (10 CFR Part
961), were promulgated through rulemaking and provide that the Department will:
<p>
<ul>
<li>take title to the spent nuclear fuel as expeditiously as practicable following
commencement of operation of a repository, and
<li>in return for the payment of fees, beginning not later than January 31, 1998, dispose of
such spent nuclear fuel.<a href="./foota.htm">[1]</a>
</ul><p>
The Act directed the Department of Energy to study the need for and feasibility of a monitored
retrievable storage facility for the purpose of storing nuclear waste on an interim basis prior to
disposing of it permanently in an underground repository and to submit to Congress a
site-specific proposal for such a facility. It also required the Federal Government to transport
spent nuclear fuel to a Federal storage facility, utilizing private industry to the fullest extent
possible. 
<p>
The Act defines certain units of government as "affected" because of their jurisdiction over the
site of a proposed geologic repository or monitored retrievable storage facility, and permits the
Secretary of Energy to designate additional units of local government as "affected" because of
their proximity to such sites. It requires the Department to provide financial assistance to support
participation of parties with "affected" status.
<p>
The Department was directed to issue general guidelines for the recommendation of sites for
repositories, which were finalized in December 1984 as <em>General Guidelines for the
Recommendation of Sites for the Nuclear Waste Repositories</em> (10 CFR Part 960), and to
characterize multiple sites for possible development of a geologic repository. The Department
selected nine sites to study as candidates for the first repository. In May 1986, the Secretary
nominated five sites as suitable for the first repository, and recommended three of the sites to the
President for approval for site characterization. The President approved three sites: Yucca
Mountain, Nevada; Deaf Smith County, Texas; and the Hanford Site, Washington. The
Department also began the process of identifying sites for a second repository.
<p>
<strong>Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 1987</strong><br>

Motivated in part by concern about program costs, Congress reassessed the need to characterize
three potential repository sites. Through passage of the Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act
of 1987, Congress redirected the Department to focus its site characterization activities only at
Yucca Mountain, Nevada, and report on the need for a second repository on or after January 1,
2007 but no later than January 1, 2010. 
<p>
The Department's proposal to locate a monitored retrievable storage facility at a site at Clinch
River in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, with two alternative sites in Tennessee, was nullified in the
Amendments Act. Congress directed that the need for a monitored retrievable storage facility be
examined by a commission before the Department could proceed and restricted the Department's
ability to site and develop such a facility by prohibiting:
<p>
<ul>
<li>selection of  a monitored retrievable storage facility site until the Secretary of Energy
recommends for Presidential approval a site for development as a repository;
<li>selection of a site within the State of Nevada; and
<li>commencing facility construction until the Nuclear Regulatory Commission issues a
license for the construction of a repository.
</ul>
<p>
The Amendments Act established the Office of the Nuclear Waste Negotiator to seek a volunteer
host site for a respository or monitored retrievable storage facility and also expanded external
oversight of the Department of Energy by establishing the Nuclear Waste Technical Review
Board, authorizing on-site oversight representatives of host jurisdictions, and providing for
increased local government participation.
<p>
Finally, the Amendments Act required that packages for transport be certified by the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission, and that the Department provide technical assistance and funds to
States to train transportation public safety officials.
<p>
<strong>External Oversight and Regulation</strong><br>

Recognizing the far-reaching implications of national radioactive waste management policy,
Congress mandated that oversight and regulation of the Department's civilian radioactive waste
management activities be provided by a number of external organizations. 
<p>
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission was made responsible for overseeing the safety of the
Civilian Radioactive Waste Management System through its process of licensing waste
management facilities and certifying other system components, such as waste containers. The
Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board was directed to evaluate the technical and scientific
validity of program activities. The Environmental Protection Agency was charged with
promulgating generally applicable standards for protection of the general environment from
off-site releases from radioactive material in repositories.
<p>
Additionally, the National Academy of Sciences has provided analysis and recommendations
regarding waste management system issues at various times, sometimes at specific Congressional
direction. For example, the Energy Policy Act of 1992 directed the Environmental Protection
Agency to contract with the Academy for a study to provide recommendations on standards for
protection of the public from the radioactive waste that might be disposed of in a geologic
repository at the Yucca Mountain site. A special Academy committee completed its report, and
the Environmental Protection Agency is currently developing revised regulations in light of  the
committee's recommendations.
<p>
The Nuclear Waste Policy Act also gave specific rights to the State of Nevada and affected units
of local government to oversee the development of the system. Since its inception, the Program
has also solicited external expertise and opinion through its own initiatives, and has sought the
involvement of a broad range of stakeholders, including State and local officials, nuclear utilities
and their regulators, environmental groups, labor unions, and the general public to contribute to
its decision-making process. 
<p>
<strong>Civilian Radioactive Waste Management System</strong><br>

As directed by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, as amended, the Department of Energy's Civilian
Radioactive Waste Management Program initiated the development of  a waste management
system consisting of three components: a geologic repository for permanent disposal of spent
nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste; a monitored retrievable storage facility for
temporary waste storage (if Congress approves the Department's proposal for the construction of
such a facility or facilities); and a system for transporting the waste from commercial reactor sites
to the temporary and permanent facilities. <a href="./fig12.gif"><em>Figure 12</em></a> on the following page illustrates the waste
management system as contemplated in the Act. 
<p>
<pre><strong>				Figure 12
		Civilian Radioactive Waste Management System 
		          As Originally Envisioned<br></strong>
	<img src="fig12.gif">
</pre><p>
<strong>Geologic Repository</strong><br>

The strategic endpoint of the Civilian Radioactive Waste Management System is the
emplacement of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste in special packages in a deep
geologic repository to isolate the waste for at least tens of thousands of years. The waste isolation
performance of the repository will rely on multiple barriers, both natural and engineered. The
natural barrier will be the rock formations of the repository site. The principal engineered barrier
will be the waste package, which consists of the waste form, a disposal container, and any
supplemental barriers such as backfill surrounding the waste package. Waste emplacement
activities at the repository will incorporate multiple back-up safety systems and equipment to
protect workers and the public.
<p>
<strong>Monitored Retrievable Storage Facility</strong><br>

Congress directed that a proposal be developed for the construction of one or more facilities for
the monitored retrievable storage of spent fuel. As originally conceived, a monitored retrievable
storage facility was to be deployed to provide back-up storage only if development of a geologic
repository were significantly delayed. The facility would duplicate the spent fuel receiving and
consolidating functions of the repository, and would be phased out of operation when the
repository was in operation and had significantly reduced the backlog of spent fuel at the
reactors. The facility would include a building with equipment for spent nuclear fuel reception,
inspection, disassembly, and consolidation into storage packages; a large storage yard; and the
necessary support facilities.
<p>
After a subsequent reassessment of the monitored retrievable storage concept, the Department
concluded that the facility should be deployed as an integral part of the waste management
system, with expanded capabilities, rather than serve as a back-up to be constructed only in case
of repository development delays.
 <p>
The Department's current strategy for implementing a near-term interim storage program, if and
when interim storage authorization is enacted, is for a less-complex facility to be developed and
licensed in two phases. The first phase of the facility would be limited to the receipt and storage
of spent nuclear fuel in sealed canisters or casks, and could thus be brought into operation
relatively quickly. The second phase of the facility, which would require more time to develop,
would include the capability to receive uncanistered spent fuel assemblies and transfer them to
sealed canisters for on-site storage. Phased development would facilitate timely implementation
of the interim storage facility.
<p>
<strong>Transportation Sub-system</strong><br>

The Civilian Radioactive Waste Management System also includes the development of  a
transportation sub-system to provide waste acceptance at reactor sites and shipment to an interim
storage facility or directly to a repository. Under previous plans, development of the
transportation sub-system had been paced to support waste receipt at a geologic repository. Those
plans had included development through Federal contracts of special casks for truck, rail, and
barge shipment of waste. 
<p>
Under the sub-system now envisioned, multiple contracts would be awarded to competing
contractors to arrange waste shipments; acquire, maintain, and inspect equipment; plan and
schedule operations; and train personnel. Transportation routes would be identified following the
selection of interim storage and repository sites, and the technical assistance and funds would be
provided to States for training public safety officials of local governments and Indian tribes
through whose jurisdiction waste will be shipped. 
<p>
Shipments will be made by truck, rail, or barge, or a combination of these modes. From an
interim storage facility, the spent nuclear fuel will be transported on dedicated trains to the
repository. In vitrified form, defense-related high-level radioactive waste is planned to be shipped
by rail directly from storage sites to the repository. The planned schedule, activities, and products
have been redirected under the revised Program Plan, as described in<a href="./ch22.htm"> <em>Section 2.2</a> and <a href="./appc.htm">Appendix
C.</a></em>
<hr><hr>
<h3><em>Footnotes:</em></h3>
<em><strong>[1]</strong> In May 1995, the Department published a finding that it has no legal obligation under the Act
or the Standard Contract to begin disposal of spent nuclear fuel by January 31, 1998 in the
absence of a repository or interim storage facility constructed under the Nuclear Waste Policy
Act, as amended.

<body><h2>Appendix C<br>
Site-Specific Waste Acceptance, Storage, and Transportation Strategy</h2>
<hr>
<h4>Introduction</h4><p>

<a href="./ch22.htm"><em>Section 2.2</em> </a>of the Program Plan, Revision 1, describes activities to acquire the capability for
waste acceptance, storage, and transportation, which will be conducted prior to interim storage
facility site designation under the Program's revised strategy. This appendix describes the waste
acceptance, interim storage, and transportation activities currently planned to begin once a
facility site is designated.
<p>
<h4>Planning Assumptions</h4>
<p>
Plans for activities following interim storage facility site designation are based on the following
assumptions:
<p>
<ul>
<li> The $85 million reserved in the Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act of
1996 will be requested by the Administration and will be made available in Fiscal Year 1998
appropriations for non-site specific activities. 
<li>Legislation designating an interim storage site will be enacted approximately six months
after the 1998 completion of the Yucca Mountain viability assessment.
<li>Site-specific work on a Federal interim storage facility will be initiated with Fiscal Year
1999 funding.
<li> Design, licensing, and construction will take approximately three and one-half years
following designation of a site for interim storage, assuming the necessary funding is provided to
develop a topical safety analysis report and conduct related design and analysis work.
<li>Interim storage facility legislation will be enacted which:<br>
-    authorizes implementation in two phases to facilitate the earliest possible
acceptance of waste;<br>
 -    requires separate environmental reports for each phase of construction;<br>
 -    allows construction of an interim storage facility to begin as soon as the license
application is submitted; and<br>
 -    directs the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to develop an Environmental Impact
Statement for the interim storage facility, based on an environmental report submitted with the
license application.<br>
<li>The interim storage facility will be designed, licensed, constructed, and brought into 
operation using best commercial practices, and in accordance with the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission regulation <em>Licensing Requirements for the Independent Storage of Spent Nuclear
Fuel and High-Level Radioactive Waste </em>(10 CFR Part 72) and other applicable regulations.
<li> An interim storage facility environmental report and license application will be submitted
to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in 2000.
<li> The Federal interim storage facility will begin receiving spent fuel deliveries from the
waste acceptance, storage, and transportation contractors in 2002.
</ul><p>
<h4>Key Planning Elements</h4>
<p>
<strong>Waste Acceptance, Storage, and Transportation</strong><p>

<strong>Competitive procurement for waste acceptance, storage, and transportation services</strong><br>
The Program is contemplating carrying out its waste acceptance, storage, and transportation
functions using a market-driven approach that relies on competitive contracts with the private
sector for implementation. Under this initiative, contractors will perform their functions
consistent with the<em> Standard Contract (Article IV.B) </em>by accepting spent fuel at Purchasers sites
on behalf of the Department and delivering it to a Department facility. Contractors would be
compensated based on performance of these services and would accept financial risk. Contractors
will be encouraged to use innovative approaches to improve efficiency, to solve problems, to
overcome obstacles to performance, and to lower costs.
<p>
<em>Multiple Awards:</em> It is envisioned that this will be the first of several similar future procurements
covering waste acceptance, storage modules, and transportation services and equipment to be
provided over several decades. For the purpose of establishing and sustaining viable competition,
the Department is contemplating awarding multiple fixed-price type contracts. One approach
under consideration is to divide the country into regions. (For example, the four Nuclear
Regulatory Commission regions might be used.) Under this approach, one contractor would
provide waste acceptance and transportation services to all Purchasers in a given region for the
duration of the contract period. Selected contractors would be responsible to provide waste
acceptance and transportation services to all Purchasers with allocations in the Department's
<em>Acceptance Priority Ranking and Annual Capacity Report</em> within their respective service regions.
To preserve competition and encourage industrial capability within the market place, no single
offerer would be awarded more than a portion of the work.
<p>
<em>Scope of Services:</em> Contractors will be responsible to accept spent fuel on behalf of the
Department as identified in the <em>Acceptance Priority Ranking and the Annual Capacity Report </em>at
Purchasers' facilities and deliver it to a Federal facility (either a repository or an interim storage
facility). Contractors would be responsible to provide all transportation casks and equipment
suitable for use at Purchasers' sites, accept spent fuel for shipment as an agent of the
Department, and deliver the spent fuel and compatible storage systems to the Department facility.
Initially, spent fuel delivered to the facility would be canistered before arrival at the facility. At
some point in the service period, the facility license may be amended to allow handling of
uncanistered spent fuel, and the contractor may be required to transition to delivery of
uncanistered spent fuel.
<p>
Transportation and storage would be carried out using commercially available equipment in
compliance with applicable Nuclear Regulatory Commission and Department of Transportation 
regulations, Department of Energy acceptance criteria, and standard commercial practices.
Contractors would provide service in accordance with the <em>Acceptance Priority Ranking and
Annual Capacity Report;</em> however, contractors might, with Purchaser agreement and notification
to the Department, alter the order of acceptance to achieve efficiency of operation or to lower
costs. Contractors would also be responsible for any intermodal transport required, including
heavy haul, whether from the Purchasers' sites or to the Federal receiving facility.
<p>
<em>Schedule: </em>Schedule specifics would be addressed in the solicitation. For planning purposes, it is
expected that a Federal facility could be in operation to receive spent nuclear fuel within three
and one-half years of Congressional direction and contractors could be expected to begin
developing service arrangements with Purchasers two to three years before spent nuclear fuel
shipment.
<p>
<strong>Technical assistance and funding</strong>
<br>
Approximately three years before the start of waste acceptance and transportation operations, the
Program would begin providing technical assistance and funding for training public safety
officials in emergency response and safe transport procedures, as required under Section 180 
of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, as amended.<a href="./ch22.htm"><em> Section 2.2.2</em></a> provides an expanded discussion of
this requirement.
<p>
<strong>Interim Storage</strong><br>

The development of an interim storage facility would include environmental, design, licensing,
and construction activities. Development of the facility would be accelerated by licensing and
constructing the facility in two phases:
<p><ul>
<li><strong> Phase I</strong> operations would be limited to the acceptance of spent nuclear fuel in canisters
suitable for transportation and storage. Operations in this phase would not require the
construction of spent fuel-handling facilities, which would be deferred to Phase II.
<li><strong>Phase II</strong> operations would include acceptance of uncanistered spent nuclear fuel that
would be transferred from transportation casks to storage casks for storage on site at the interim
storage facility. 
</ul><p>
Following the designation of a site, the Program would perform a detailed site investigation and
develop an environmental report to be submitted to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission as a part
of the Phase I license application. The environmental report would provide the basis for an
Environmental Impact Statement to be prepared by the Commission. Site-specific activities, 
including site-specific facility design and preparation of  the Phase I license application, would
begin following the enactment of legislation designating a site. These activities would draw on
the non-site specific work conducted under the first stage of the strategy before site designation.
The Program would also develop and issue request(s) for proposals for facility construction and
operation.
<p>
Following submission of the license application, the Program would complete final procurement
and construction design and award a contract or contracts for constructing and operating Phase I
of the facility.  Upon issuance of  an Environmental Impact Statement, a Record of Decision on
the Environmental Impact Statement, and an interim storage facility operating license by the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Phase I facility would begin accepting canistered spent fuel.
Spent fuel acceptance and interim storage facility operations are expected to commence
approximately four years after a site is designated.
<p>
<pre><strong>                                 Figure 13
		Conceptual Phase I Interim Storage Facility Design</strong>     
<br>
	      <img src="fig13.jpg">
</pre><br>
<h6>A Phase I interim storage facility would have the capability to receive canistered spent nuclear fuel and to transfer the canistered spent fuel from transportation casks to storage casks for interim storage. The storage yard would consist of a concrete pad with appropriate security and monitoring systems. Temporary facilities would be provided for administrative activities.</h6>
<p>
Phase II development would proceed concurrently with Phase I development and operations, and
would follow the same general process, but would take about two years longer due to the
requirements of designing, licensing, and constructing a facility to handle uncanistered spent
nuclear fuel. Under the assumed timetable, the Phase II license application would be submitted to
the Nuclear Regulatory Commission an estimated six months before the Phase I license is
granted. Transportation and receipt of uncanistered spent nuclear fuel would commence when the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission issues the Phase II license. <a href="./fig13.jpg"><em>Figures 13</em> </a>(on the preceding page)
and<a href="fig14.gif"> <em>14</em></a> (on this page) present a preliminary concept of Phase I and Phase II interim storage
facilities.
<p>

		Conceptual Phase II Interim Storage Facility Design</strong>    
<br>
	     <img src="fig14.gif">
</pre><br>
<h6>A Phase II interim storage facility would include fuel transfer facilities capable of handling uncanistered spent fuel at a receipt rate of up to 3,000 metric tons of uranium (MTU) per year. Phase II of the interim storage facility would be constructed as an adjunct to the Phase I facility, incorporating modular construction techniques to the maximum extent practical. Storage would be in individual concrete storage casks on a concrete pad. Phase II would also include a facility for handling any waste generated on the site, a centralized control room, and a vehicle maintenance facility. In Phase II, temporary facilities and trailers constructed in Phase I would be replaced with permanent facilities.</h6>

<body><h2>Appendix E<br>Glossary</h2>
<hr>
<strong>Actinides</strong> are a set of 14 radioactive heavy metals, from thorium to
lawrencium in the periodic chart
of elements. 
<p>
<strong>Advanced Conceptual Design</strong> refers to the final part of the conceptual design
phase for the
repository, including engineered barriers and the waste package. It is intended to develop
possible
solutions to all identified design-related licensing issues and to develop design requirements for
the
technical baseline. This phase will explore limited design alternatives and will establish and
refine
the design criteria and concepts to be finalized in the later design phases that will support
licensing
and construction. 
<p>
<strong>Burnup</strong> refers to the reduction of fissionable material in the nuclear fuel that is
used up during the
nuclear fission process in a reactor. As the fissionable material is depleted, the ability of the fuel
to
sustain a chain reaction (reactivity) declines. 
<p>
<strong>Burnup credit </strong>refers to a strategy being considered for effective reduction in
calculated spent nuclear
fuel reactivity in multi-purpose canisters and transportation casks. The strategy considers the
burnup
of fuel instead of using fresh fuel assumptions in establishing criticality control measures and the
design of the appropriate spent nuclear fuel geometry and neutron-absorbing material that must
be
utilized in spent nuclear fuel loading. Burnup credit is one of the licensing issues that may be
addressed in obtaining certificates of compliance for transportation casks. 
<p>
<strong>Criticality control</strong> refers to the suite of measures taken to maintain nuclear
fuel, including spent
nuclear fuel, in a subcritical condition during storage, transportation and disposal, so that no
self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction can occur. Subcriticality is assured by loading spent fuel in
specific configurations that meet certain requirements related to fuel age, enrichment, and
reduction
in nuclear fuel reactivity through burnup. 
<p>
<strong>Contract holders </strong>refer to owners and generators of spent nuclear fuel who
have contracted with the
Department of Energy for acceptance and disposal of the spent fuel under provisions of the
Nuclear
Waste Policy Act. 
<p>
<strong>Defense high-level nuclear waste</strong> refers to high-level waste generated in the
course of national
defense activities. 
<p>
<strong>Drift </strong>is a horizontal or near-horizontal passageway in a mine. 
<p>
<strong>Dry transfer</strong> refers to moving spent nuclear fuel into a container or between
containers in the absence
of a spent fuel storage pool; transfer is generally conducted in pools, where the water provides
cooling and radiation shielding. 
<p>
<strong>Energy Policy Act (42 USC 1251 et seq.)</strong> refers to comprehensive
energy legislation enacted by Congress in 1992. Section 801 of the
Act directed the Environmental Protection Agency to contract with
the National Academy of Sciences to provide "findings and
recommendations on reasonable standards...that would govern the
long-term performance of a repository at the Yucca Mountain site." 
Section 802 of the Act extended the term of the Nuclear Waste
Negotiator. Section 803 of the Act instructed the Department of
Energy to evaluate whether its current programs and plans are
adequate to deal with additional volumes or categories of nuclear
waste that might be generated by nuclear power plants newly
licensed after October 1992. 
<p>
<strong>Engineered barrier</strong> refers to a manmade component of a disposal
system designed to prevent the releases of radionuclides from the
underground facility. This term includes the waste form, the waste
package, materials placed over and around the waste packages, and
barriers used to seal penetrations directed into and within the
underground facility.
<p>
<strong>Environmental Assessment</strong> refers to a public document for which a
Federal agency is responsible that serves to provide sufficient
evidence and analysis for determining whether to prepare an
environmental impact statement or a finding of no significant
impact. 
<p>
<strong>Environmental Impact Statement</strong> refers to a detailed written
statement to support a decision to proceed with major Federal
actions affecting the quality of the human environment. Required by
the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the environmental
impact statement describes:  the environmental impact of the
proposed action; any adverse environmental effects which cannot be
avoided should the proposal be implemented; alternatives to the
proposed action <em>(although the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, as amended,
precludes consideration of certain alternatives);</em> the relationship
between local short-term uses of man's environment and the
maintenance and enhancement of long-term productivity; and any
irreversible and irretrievable commitments of resources which would
be involved in the proposed action should it be implemented.
Preparation of an environmental impact statement requires a public
process that includes public meetings, reviews, and comments, as
well as agency responses to the public comments.
<p>
<strong>Environmental Report </strong>is a document, similar in content to an
environmental impact statement, required of facility license
applicants for submission to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The
document, while it does not involve the public process required in
an environmental impact statement, serves to provide information
necessary to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement by the
Commission.
<p>

radioactive material that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
consistent with existing law, determines requires permanent
isolation. The Civilian Radioactive Waste Management System will
accept only solidified high-level waste.
<p>
<strong>Information management architecture</strong> refers to the conceptual
framework that guides the building of an efficient, effective, and
flexible information infrastructure. The architecture provides the
blueprint upon which all information, data, and information systems
are defined, organized, developed, accessed, maintained, and
managed for the Program.
<p>
<strong>Institutional activities</strong> refer to activities involving stakeholders
and the public, and includes  participation in program decision
making, program information dissemination, and program funding to
State and local governments and stakeholder groups.
<p>

nuclear fuel and high-level nuclear waste from owners and
generators for temporary storage prior to permanent disposal in a
repository. See also monitored retrievable storage facility.
<p>
<strong>License application </strong>is a document submitted to the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission containing general information and a safety
analysis for either a geologic repository or an interim storage
facility. A license is required to receive, possess and dispose of
spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste.
<p>
<strong>Licensing Support System</strong> refers to an electronic information
retrieval and distribution system to support the licensing process,
as required by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in 10 CFR Part 2,
Subpart J. This system must be certified by the Commission at least
six months before the Department submits a repository license
application. The Department has worked with the Commission and the
Commission-sponsored stakeholder group to develop an acceptable
system that will be used for document discovery by all participants
in the repository licensing hearings.
<p>
<strong>Metric tons heavy metal (MTHM)</strong> refers to metals with high atomic
numbers which are loaded into nuclear reactors to take part in
chain reactions. Examples of heavy metals include thorium, uranium,
plutonium, and neptunium. When used in the Civilian Radioactive
Waste Management Program, the term usually refers to the mass of
heavy metal in spent fuel which was present when the fuel was
initially loaded into a reactor. 
<p>
<strong>Metric tons of uranium (MTU) </strong>refers to the mass of uranium in spent
nuclear fuel which was present when the fuel was initially loaded

the Federal statute that is the national charter for protection of
the environment. The Act is implemented by procedures issued by the
Council on Environmental Quality. These procedures ensure that
environmental information is available to public officials and
citizens before Federal decisions are made and before Federal
actions are taken. The Act was amended in 1987.

Register eliciting the views of affected parties on issues that may
result in rulemaking by a Federal agency.
<p>
<strong>Notice of Intent</strong> refers to a notice published in the Federal
Register to inform the public that an environmental impact
statement will be prepared and considered by a Federal agency. The
notice is required by the National Environmental Policy Act
implementing procedures. The notice must describe the proposed
action and possible alternatives; describe the agency's proposed
scoping process including whether, when, and where any scoping
meeting will be held; and state the name of an agency official who
can answer questions about the proposed action and the
environmental impact statement.
<p>
<strong>Nuclear Waste Fund</strong> refers to a separate fund in the U.S. Treasury
established by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act to assure that the
costs of high-level radioactive waste management and disposal are
borne by the owners and generators of the waste. Civilian utility
payments for spent fuel disposal are deposited in the Fund and
later appropriated by Congress to cover Program costs.
Appropriations from the Fund can only be used for purposes defined
in the Act. Since civilian payments must cover both current and
long-term costs, utility payments in excess of current
appropriations are invested in Treasury securities that pay
interest to the Fund. Defense Nuclear Waste Disposal
Appropriations, which are intended for expenditure during the
appropriation year, are not deposited in the Fund.
<p>
<strong>Nuclear Waste Policy Act (42 USC 10101 et seq.) </strong>refers to the
Federal statute enacted in 1982 that established the Office of
Civilian Radioactive Waste Management and defined its mission to
develop a Federal system for the management and geologic disposal
of commercial spent nuclear fuel and other high-level radioactive
wastes, as appropriate. The Act also specified other Federal
responsibilities for nuclear waste management, established the
Nuclear Waste Fund to cover the cost of geologic disposal,
authorized interim storage until a repository is available, and
defined interactions between Federal agencies and the states, local
governments, and Indian tribes. 
<p>
<strong>Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 1987 (42 USC 10101 et seq.)</strong>
refers to legislation which amended the Nuclear Waste Policy Act to
limit repository site characterization activities to Yucca
Mountain, Nevada; to establish the Office of the Nuclear Waste
Negotiator to seek a State or Indian tribe willing to host a
repository or monitored retrievable storage facility; to create the
Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board; and to increase State and
local government participation in the waste management program.
<p>

independent from
individuals who performed the work but have technical expertise at least equivalent to those who
performed the original work. 
<p>
<strong>Performance assessment</strong> refers to any analysis that predicts the behavior of a
system or a component
of a system under a given set of constant or transient conditions.

<p>
<strong>Quality assurance</strong> refers to all of the planned and systematic actions necessary
to provide adequate
confidence that a structure, system, or component is constructed according to plans and
specifications and will perform satisfactorily.  The Program has established a rigorous quality
assurance program which is required and overseen by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
Establishment and execution of the quality assurance program is intended to protect the health
and
safety of the public and workers, and the environment. Compliance with the quality assurance
program enables us to collect and maintain qualified, traceable data that can be used and
considered
valid by the Commission and other oversight bodies during program execution and licensing
proceedings. 
<p>
<strong>Reactivity</strong> is a measure of a nuclear system's potential to self-sustain a nuclear

<h2>2.2 Waste Acceptance, Storage, and Transportation Project</h2>
<hr>
<strong>Background</strong><br>
<p>
The December 1994 Program Plan described an approach for the Waste Acceptance, Storage,
and Transportation Project that included efforts to develop a multi-purpose canister by 1998 for
possible at-reactor storage; to maintain readiness to develop an interim storage facility if a site
were designated by the Congress and the authority and resources were provided; and to develop a
readiness to accept and transport spent nuclear fuel from reactors to a storage facility whenever
such a facility became available. The waste acceptance and transportation capability was to be
based on certifying a new high-capacity truck cask and a transportation overpack for the
multi-purpose canisters and constructing prototypes by the end of 1998. A fleet of casks or
overpacks would be purchased when a firm shipment schedule was available.
<p>
Further Presidential and Congressional guidance, together with reduced funding, have led to a
reassessment and redirection of the approach outlined in the 1994 Program Plan. The Waste
Acceptance, Storage, and Transportation Project's funding level was reduced by 76 percent from
$57 million in Fiscal Year 1995 to $13.6 million in Fiscal Year 1996. The reduction reflects the
Congressional reservation of $85 million from the Program's total $400 million appropriation
pending legislative authorization to develop an interim storage facility. 
<p>
The Congress is considering legislation that would direct rapid development of an interim storage
facility and designate a specific facility site. The Administration, however, opposes designation
of a site and any site-specific facility development work until the completion of a viability
assessment of Yucca Mountain as a geologic repository site in 1998.
<p>
<strong>A Revised Strategy</strong><br>

We have developed a revised strategy that will enable the Program to acquire the 
capability for waste acceptance, storage, and transportation as rapidly and efficiently as possible,
consistent with current guidance from the President and the Congress, and reflecting the
consequences of the reduced program funding level for Fiscal Year 1996. The later years of the
schedule are based on an assumption that after completion of the Yucca Mountain viability
assessment in 1998, the Program will receive the necessary statutory authority, sufficient
funding, and a site designation to initiate work on an interim storage facility in 1999.
<p>
Prior to interim storage facility site designation, the Waste Acceptance, Storage, and
Transportation Project will establish a blueprint for the development of waste acceptance,
storage, and transportation systems. Activities during this period will be directed towards
achieving two major near-term objectives.
<p>
<ul>
<li>Develop a market-driven waste acceptance, storage, and transportation approach that
relies on the private sector for implementation.
<li>Conduct non-site specific design and engineering safety analyses for an interim storage
facility to reduce facility licensing time once a site is designated.
</ul><p>
After designation of a storage facility site, Project activities will address development of an
interim storage facility at the specified site and the acquisition of related waste acceptance,
storage, and transportation services. These activities consist of system design and implementation
efforts that can occur only after a site has been designated, and thus are contingent on further
Presidential and Congressional action that provides statutory authority, funding, and storage
facility site designation. Assuming that these Presidential and Congressional actions are
completed in 1999, we would award multiple contracts for waste acceptance, storage modules,
and transportation services and equipment in the same year and submit our environmental
analyses, in compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act, and our license application
to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in 2000. If the Program is given legislative authorization
to commence facility construction upon submittal of a license application, as was recently
proposed in the Congress, the target date to begin accepting spent fuel at an interim storage
facility could be as early as 2002. Activities and milestones planned for the period after site
designation are depicted in <a href="./fig9.gif"><em>Figure 9 </em></a>on page 67 and described further in <a href="./appc.htm"><em>Appendix C</a></em>.
<p>
In addition to priority activities directly associated with the two major near-term objectives and
summarized below, the Project will continue various support activities that will play a significant
role in successful  implementation of  the waste acceptance, storage, and transportation
components of the waste management system. These activities are described in<em> Section 2.2.2</em>.
<p>
<h4>2.2.1     Priority Activities to Achieve Major Near-Term Objectives</h4>
<p>
<strong>Developing a market-driven waste acceptance, storage, and transportation approach that relies on
the private sector for implementation</strong><br>
The Program plans to rely upon a competitive private sector procurement to create the necessary
national transportation capability to move spent nuclear fuel from locations throughout the
United States to a centralized interim storage facility. This capability would also be utilized to
transport waste to a permanent disposal facility. We intend to publish a Notice of Expression of
Interest in publications such as the <em>Federal Register, Commerce Business Daily,</em> and trade
journals to solicit industry and vendor views on the proposed approach, which is described
further in<a href="./appc.htm"><em> Appendix C</em></a>. We will be prepared to issue a request for proposals and award multiple
contracts for equipment and services on a timely basis when the national policy and schedule for
near-term management of spent nuclear fuel are resolved. This approach will offer a market
stimulus for private sector development of equipment and management capability required for
the transportation of spent nuclear fuel.
<p>
<strong>Conducting non-site specific design and engineering safety analyses for an interim storage
facility to reduce facility development time once a site is designated</strong><br>
The Program will pursue opportunities to carry out preliminary work relating to the licensing of
an interim storage facility in advance of site designation,  including development of a facility
design based on conservatively determined environmental and design parameters that can
accommodate virtually any site, and performance of safety analyses. We will initiate interactions
with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to discuss and evaluate non-site specific safety issues.
Siting evaluation factors contained in Nuclear Regulatory Commission regulations (10 CFR Part
72) and other Commission guidance will be used to assist in developing conservative design
parameters.
<p>
Subject to future funding considerations, the Program will complete a topical safety analysis
report for submittal to the Commission. Submittal of the topical safety analysis report and its
subsequent review by the Commission, ahead of site designation, will reduce the time required
later for preparation of the license application and reduce licensing risks related to design and
safety considerations. The report would describe facility design, operations, and supporting
systems; demonstrate conformance with the Commission's siting evaluation factors and general
design criteria; and present the results of radiological and safety analyses. The report would
contain the required analyses and evaluations necessary to demonstrate that operation of the
facility would not endanger the health and safety of the public. The Commission will document
its review and approval of the topical safety analysis report in a safety evaluation report which,
along with the topical safety analysis report, will be referenced in any subsequent interim storage
facility license application.
<p>
<h4>2.2.2     Other Activities Supporting Waste Acceptance, Storage, and Transportation</h4> 
<p>
<strong>Waste Acceptance Activities</strong><br>
Waste acceptance activities are those necessary for the Department of Energy to take title to and
physical possession of spent nuclear fuel or high-level radioactive waste from owners and
generators of these wastes. In addition to the physical transfer of ownership, waste acceptance
activities include the planning, preparation, and completion of the procedures and documentation
necessary to accomplish the transfer. Waste acceptance is the first step in fulfilling the
Department's responsibility to dispose of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste.
The Program will conduct the following activities to support its waste acceptance responsibility.
<p>
<em>Interaction with contract holders</em>. The Program will continue activities in support of the standard
contract, codified in 10 CFR Part 961, for acceptance of commercial spent fuel from nuclear
utilities. Review and approval of delivery commitment schedules from utilities will continue. 
<p>
<em>Integration of Federal spent nuclear fuel and defense high-level radioactive waste into program
plans.</em> The Program will complete a memorandum of agreement with the Department of Energy's
Office of Environmental Management creating a unified system for the acceptance of Federal
spent fuel and defense high-level radioactive waste destined for geologic disposal. We will also
complete the development of acceptance criteria for these wastes.
<p>
<em>Preparing for material control and accounting of accepted waste.</em> The Program will continue
interactions with government agencies, utilities, and others to establish safeguards and security
requirements for spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste to be accepted by the
Department. Spent fuel verification requirements for utilities will be developed, and mechanisms
will be established for documenting and maintaining information on all spent fuel and high-level
radioactive waste loaded into sealed canisters. A unified data base system will be developed and
implemented in phases. The system will integrate existing data bases and provide a single source
of data for common use to support waste acceptance planning and operations, including
continued tracking of spent fuel generation, material control and accounting, and spent fuel
verification.
<p>
<strong>Storage Activities</strong><br>
In addition to planning for the potential development of an interim storage facility and associated
services and equipment, the Program's storage support activities will include technology
demonstration projects that may benefit one or more areas of the Program, and close-out of
activities related to the multi-purpose canister system. 
<p>
<em>Dry Transfer System.</em> The Spent Nuclear Fuel Dry Transfer System Development and
Demonstration Project, conducted under a cooperative agreement with the Electric Power
Research Institute, will be continued. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate a low cost
system for handling individual spent fuel assemblies in the absence of a spent fuel storage pool.
The transfer of spent fuel into a cask or between casks generally takes place under water in
storage pools which provide cooling and shielding. Spent fuel storage pools may not be available
in the future at some reactor sites, such as reactors that are no longer operating, or at an interim
storage facility. In Fiscal Year 1996, the Program will also submit a topical safety analysis report
on the Dry Transfer System design to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for review and
approval.
<p>
<em>Multi-Purpose Canister System</em>. We will close out efforts related to the development of a
multi-purpose canister system. The Department of the Navy, which had been a cooperating
agency on the Environmental Impact Statement for the multi-purpose canister system, has
become the lead agency and will proceed with the part of the Environmental Impact Statement
covering naval spent nuclear fuel container selection. The Program's documentation of its work
related to preparing an Environmental Impact Statement and developing designs for the
multi-purpose canister system will be archived. The Program will complete as scheduled the first
phase of the contract with Westinghouse Electric Corporation for development of a
multi-purpose canister design and completion of safety analysis reports.
<p>
<strong>Transportation Activities</strong><br>
<em>High-capacity truck cask.</em> Due to funding reductions, the contract with General Atomics to
design, develop, certify, and fabricate the GA-4 and GA-9 high-capacity legal-weight truck cask
system is being terminated. Cask designs have been completed. To support certification efforts,
safety analysis reports were submitted to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and a half-scale
model of the GA-4 cask design was fabricated and tested.
<p>
<em>Obtaining "burnup credit" for cask or canister design.</em> "Burnup" is a measure of the amount of
fissionable material in reactor fuel that is used up in the nuclear fission process while the fuel is
in a reactor. The fuel burnup process also produces fissionable material and a variety of neutron
absorbing materials. The net effect is a decrease in reactivity (the fuel's ability to support a chain
reaction) over time. As the fissionable material is depleted in this way and neutron absorbers
build up, the reactivity of the fuel declines. Nuclear Regulatory Commission practices for safety
calculations for spent fuel storage and transportation technologies use the conservative
assumption that the fuel is fresh (with zero burnup) and therefore has the highest possible
reactivity.
<p>
Burnup credit refers to the concept of taking regulatory credit in required safety calculations for
the reductions in spent nuclear fuel reactivity that occur as a result of the usage of fuel in a
reactor. Obtaining burnup credit will improve overall system efficiency and may be important to
disposal.
<p>
The Program will continue to pursue partial (actinide-only) and principal isotope burnup credit
(actinide and selected fission products) to support the design of criticality control systems for
spent fuel storage, transportation, and disposal packages. Interactions with the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission will be pursued on issues related to the partial burnup topical report we
issued in May 1995, and on planning experiments to support principal isotope burnup credit. In
Fiscal Year 1998, the Program will submit a topical report on principal isotope burnup credit to
the Commission.
<p>
<strong>Institutional Activities</strong><br>
Institutional activities of the Waste Acceptance, Storage, and Transportation Project have been
reduced significantly in Fiscal Year 1996. These reductions include termination of institutional
work on the multi-purpose canister Environmental Impact Statement; funding cuts for all
cooperative agreements with State, tribal, regional, and technical organizations; suspension of
meetings of the Transportation Coordination Group (a long-standing group that represents a
broad range of public agencies and stakeholder groups); and termination or curtailment of
various public information activities and products.
<p>
Core transportation-related institutional activities will be maintained. The Program will continue
interactions with stakeholders to plan the implementation of Section 180(c) of the Nuclear Waste
Policy Act, which provides for technical and financial assistance to States and Indian Tribes for
training public safety officials through whose jurisdictions spent nuclear fuel and high-level
waste would be transported. In 1996, we will publish a<em> Federal Register</em> Notice of Proposed
Policy and Procedures for the implementation of Section 180(c) in which public comments will
be solicited. In the following year, the Program will publish a Notice of Final Policy and
Procedures to implement Section 180(c) of the Act.
<p>
We will also maintain interactions with stakeholders and with other Department offices through
the Transportation External Coordination and the Transportation Internal Coordination working
groups, and will continue to participate in meetings and briefings held by other parties to identify
issues, clarify policy options, and resolve issues wherever possible.

<h2>2.3 Program Management</h2>
<hr>
<strong>Background</strong><br>
The Management Center provides program integration and management support to the Program
Director and the two business centers -- the Yucca Mountain Site Characterization Project and
the Waste Acceptance, Storage, and Transportation Project. The Office of Program Management
and Integration, the Office of Human Resources and Administration, and the Office of Quality
Assurance constitute the Management Center, which is responsible for program planning and
management, technical and regulatory integration, quality assurance, institutional activities,
resources and information management, and international waste management activities. This
section describes how the Program adjusted these efforts to support its revised program strategy.
<p>
The December 1994 Program Plan described a program management approach that emphasized
products and progress, better integration of activities, clearer lines of responsibility and authority,
and more timely participation of stakeholders in the Program decision-making process. With
many of these objectives achieved, the Program has further modified program management
activities consistent with its reduced Fiscal Year 1996 funding level and guidance from the
President and the Congress.
<p>
The funding level for program management activities was reduced by 43 percent from $90
million in Fiscal Year 1995 to $51 million in Fiscal Year 1996, representing 16 percent of the
total program budget. Nearly 60 percent of the Fiscal Year 1996 program management allocation
covers costs that are effectively fixed or externally assessed, such as Federal salaries and Federal
office rent.
<p>
Program management activities have been reprioritized to support efforts to complete a viability
assessment of the Yucca Mountain repository site in 1998 and to support the development and
implementation of interim storage strategies. Building upon the management improvements
realized during Fiscal Year 1995, the Program will continue to enhance integration throughout all
program elements, to address cross-cutting technical issues, and to strengthen the effectiveness of
the management tools for baselining and tracking accomplishments and costs. Administrative
activities, such as personnel and contract administration, will continue. The reduced funding will
require a significant reduction in the Program's interactions with external parties.
<p>
<h4>2.3.1     Program Planning and Management</h4>
<p>
<strong>Program Planning</strong><br>
The Management Center will assist the Yucca Mountain Site Characterization Project and the
Waste Acceptance, Storage, and Transportation Project in developing the technical, managerial,
and institutional strategies needed to accomplish the new targets and milestones under the
Program's revised approach. The strategies and objectives of individual project-level activities
will be integrated to achieve a consistent articulation of overall program policy, and to ensure
that the Program's policy and strategies are consistent with Departmental policy. 
The Management Center will also support the Program Director in communicating program
policy to key audiences internal and external to the Department of Energy and in articulating the
rationale for strategy and plan changes to program stakeholders. Support will be provided for the
Program Director's interactions with the Congress and the Office of Management and Budget to
explain and justify the revised program approach during the appropriations process. Management
Center staff will also support interactions with the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board,
which independently evaluates the Program's technical and scientific activities.
<p>
<strong>Baseline Management</strong><br>
Program cost, schedule, and workscope baselines are used to measure contractor and participant
performance in order to ensure that the appropriate work is performed on schedule and within
budget. We will continue to refine the baseline management process that has been established to
ensure that the baselines are clearly defined and integrated, and that changes are appropriately
controlled. Program progress is regularly assessed in accordance with the milestones, baselines,
and work defined by the planning process.
<p>
In Fiscal Year 1995, program baselines were revised to represent the work effort necessary to
achieve the milestones in the 1994 program approach. Further revisions to the baselines in Fiscal
Year 1996 will reflect the redirection made necessary by the Fiscal Year 1996 appropriation and
guidance from the President and the Congress. The impact of baseline changes will be identified
and evaluated.
<p>
<strong>Integrated Management Planning</strong><br>
We are improving our contractor management systems through the establishment of a single,
integrated, and more efficient way of doing business for all program elements and participants.
This new approach will be documented in the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management
Integrated Management Plan which will establish high-level management system policy and
requirements.
<p>
<h4>2.3.2     Technical Integration
</h4><p>
Technical integration ensures that the Program's technical elements and activities are integrated
into a system that is safe, efficient, reliable, and cost-effective. The Management Center will
support the Yucca Mountain viability assessment, the market-driven waste acceptance, storage,
and transportation approach, and non-site specific interim storage efforts by focusing on the
identification and timely coordinated resolution of cross-cutting technical issues. Such issues that
potentially impact multiple program elements must be identified and resolved on schedules
consistent with the business centers' needs for the information. 
<p>
<strong>Near-term policy development and integration issues</strong><br>

<em>Waste canister options.</em> As a result of Fiscal Year 1996 appropriations actions, the Program will
not pursue further development of a multi-purpose canister system for transporting and disposing
of spent fuel. We do, however, recognize the benefits to be derived from standardization of
equipment and the desirability of encouraging designs which are suitable for later transport or use
at a Federal facility. Therefore, the Program will evaluate the impacts on the Federal program of
alternative canister options that may be developed and utilized under a market-driven waste
acceptance and transportation strategy. The technical integration evaluations will focus on the
most effective approaches to integrate the near-term requirements for the timely availability of
storage and transportation systems utilizing current technology with the evolving waste package
designs that satisfy the requirements of the disposal system. 
<p>
<em>Disposal of other Department-owned radioactive materials.</em> The Program will continue to
evaluate the impact of accepting Department-owned spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive
waste into the civilian radioactive waste management system. The Program is working with the
Department of Energy's Office of Environmental Management, the current custodians for these
materials, to ensure that the materials planned for disposal in a geologic repository meet the
statutory and regulatory requirements for geologic disposal. The Program will also continue to
interact with other Department of Energy programs in the evaluation of other waste materials,
such as weapons-useable fissile material that may be declared surplus to national defense needs,
for which decisions regarding ultimate disposition have not yet been made. 
<p>
<strong>Regulatory and Performance Requirements</strong><br>
The Program's regulatory and performance requirements have been identified and interpreted in
the various levels of Program and Project requirements documents. During Fiscal Year 1996, the
Management Center will incorporate requirements for Department-owned spent fuel into the
Program's requirements documents structure. The existing suite of program requirements
documents will be streamlined to eliminate redundancy and ensure that the Program can respond
to future changes in policy and direction in an efficient and effective manner.
Building on the regulatory and performance requirements, the Program has developed a technical
baseline that includes design packages, drawings, and analyses, and provides traceability to key
requirements. Using the technical baseline as a tool, reviews will be conducted to evaluate how
well the system design meets regulatory and performance requirements and to ensure that the
interfaces among Program elements are identified and controlled.
<p>
<h4>2.3.3     Regulatory Integration</h4>
<p>
The Management Center will focus on three principal areas of regulatory integration: plans and
strategies for compliance with applicable statutes and regulations; continued consultations with
the Nuclear Regulatory Commission regarding the repository and non-site specific interim
storage concepts; and reexamination of and possible modifications to the regulatory structure that
guides the licensing of the repository. 
<p>
<strong>Compliance with Statutes and Regulations
</strong><br>
The Management Center will continue to assist the Yucca Mountain Site Characterization Project
in developing strategies and plans for compliance with environmental, safety, and health
requirements, and will help to ensure that Project activities are consistent with Departmental
policy and with environmental impact statements completed or being prepared by other
Department of Energy programs. Pending regulatory changes will be analyzed to assist the
Program in complying with new requirements. As part of the policy development process, the
Program will participate in interagency working groups and review and comment on draft
Department of Energy orders and directives. Finally, to maintain policy consistency within the
Department, the Program will continue to interact with and provide Project data to other
Departmental offices on environmental, safety, and health issues.
<p>
<strong>Consultations with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission</strong><br>

The Program will continue consultations with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to improve
mutual understanding of the critical technical issues surrounding the repository program and the
activities required to resolve them, and to ensure that the Commission remains informed of the
Program's technical work and evaluations.
<p>
To support the objectives of the Waste Acceptance, Storage, and Transportation Project, the
Management Center will continue technical discussions with Commission staff on non-site
specific issues associated with interim storage. These discussions are expected to increase if and
when the Program is authorized to develop an interim storage facility.
<p>
<strong>Updating the Regulatory Framework for a Repository at Yucca Mountain
</strong><br>
The Management Center will work with the Yucca Mountain Site Characterization Project to
identify areas where revisions to the regulatory framework for a geologic repository are needed to
reflect the progress made in site characterization and the policy change to characterize only one
site. The Management Center will help develop revisions to the Department's siting guidelines
(10 CFR Part 960) and support interactions with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and
Environmental Protection Agency on revisions to the Program's regulatory framework.
<p>
<h4>2.3.4     Quality Assurance</h4>
<p>
The Program maintains a mandatory quality assurance program to identify and ensure
implementation of requirements that protect the health and safety of the public, workers, and the
environment. The quality assurance program must meet Nuclear Regulatory Commission
requirements. Extensive development and review of technical and implementing documentation,
as well as effective implementation of the requirements, will be necessary to ensure the
soundness of our data and engineering, and to support eventual licensing of our facilities by the
Commission. Through quality assurance audits, the quality assurance program will independently
verify that the various designs being developed and scientific activities performed incorporate the
necessary regulatory requirements.
<p>
In Fiscal Year 1996, quality assurance audits will be performed and surveillance conducted
regarding work on the viability assessment for the Yucca Mountain site and on the design and
construction of the Exploratory Studies Facility. A recently developed program-wide system will
be implemented for identifying and correcting conditions detrimental to quality and for
performing trend evaluation. The Program will also continue the OCRWM Concerns Program,
which provides a vehicle for employees to confidentially identify program concerns and to obtain
resolution.
<p>
<h4>2.3.5     Institutional Activities</h4>
<p>
The Nuclear Waste Policy Act establishes public participation as a key component in program
activities. The Program will continue its coordination with institutions, organizations,
government agencies, and individuals representing a variety of interests. Direct financial support
for cooperative agreements will continue at a significantly reduced level. To respond to reduced
funding levels, Fiscal Year 1996 funding for the Program's cooperative agreements were reduced
to one-third of Fiscal Year 1995 levels; and funding for educational programs was reduced by 34
percent. Participation in national meetings and conferences and the production of education and
information materials such as videos, photographs, and fact sheets will be reduced. Other public
information activities such as traveling exhibits and utility information center outreach will be
terminated. The OCRWM National Information Center will provide minimum essential public
information services and products. Its primary communications medium will be the OCRWM
Home Page. Users can access the system on the World Wide Web at "http://www.rw.doe.gov".
The<em> Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management Bulletin</em> will be published semiannually
rather than quarterly.
<p>
The provision of financial assistance to stakeholders needing assistance to travel to program
meetings will be suspended pending future budget decisions. The Program will continue to
announce pending decisions in the <em>Federal Register</em>; release draft documents, as appropriate, for
external review and comment; review and respond to comments in a timely manner; and provide
public comment periods at all public meetings. 
<p>
<h4>2.3.6     Resources Management
</h4><p>
<strong>Federal Human Resources
</strong><br>
The Management Center is responsible for recruiting, training, developing, evaluating
performance, and providing appropriate recognition for the Program's Federal staff and for
establishing a work place environment that supports the Program's goals and objectives. The
Program has responded to the Secretary of Energy's goal of reducing the Department workforce
during the next five years. Total Program Federal staffing levels, at 228 full-time equivalent staff
at the end of Fiscal Year 1995, will fall to 217 by the end of Fiscal Year 1996.
<p>
To aid in increasing the capabilities of Federal staff, the Program is implementing a career
development program tailored to individual employee needs. During Fiscal Year 1996, the
Program will continue this initiative, and concentrate on the execution of total quality guidelines,
temporary assignments, mentorships, and other personnel development initiatives. In Fiscal Year
l996, as the Program's staffing is being reduced, a new assessment of the qualifications, skills,
and abilities required to accomplish mission objectives will be made, and a plan will be
developed for retraining employees in areas where the appropriate complement of technical,
programmatic, and administrative staff is lacking. The Program will also continue to reform its
employee performance evaluation and recognition program in Fiscal Year l996. <a href="./fig10.gif"><em>Figure 10</em> </a>on the
following page presents the Program's Federal organization.

			   Federal Organization<br></strong>            
     <img src="fig10.gif">
</pre>
<p>
<strong>Contractor Resources</strong><br>
In response to the Fiscal Year 1996 funding reductions, the Program has had to significantly
reduce its contractor workforce. The Program had already reduced the work scope of its support
services contractors under the Department of Energy's Strategic Alignment Initiative. Payments
to support services contractors will be reduced by about 30 percent from Fiscal Year 1995 to
Fiscal Year 1996. By the end of Fiscal Year 1996, the Program's management and operating
contractor will reduce its staffing by almost 50 percent from Fiscal Year 1995 levels. 
<p>
To improve efficiency, the Program has consolidated the contractor support provided by the
Department of Energy national laboratories under the direction of the Program's management
and operating contractor.
<p>
The Program is taking steps to establish a single technical and management support services
contractor to improve the integration of activities between headquarters operations in
Washington, D.C., and the Yucca Mountain Site Characterization Project in Las Vegas, Nevada.
The Program plans to award a single contract by early Fiscal Year 1997 to consolidate these
services.<a href="./fig11.gif"> <em>Figure 11</em></a> presents the Program's contractor organization. 
<p>

		Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management
			  Contractor Organization<br></strong>
<img src="fig11.gif">
</pre><p>

<strong>Information Resources</strong><br>
The strategic application of information technology contributes to the accomplishment of the
Program's mission by providing integrated information systems, solutions, and services that
enhance the productivity of our human resources, drive business process improvement efforts,
reduce overall program costs, and support the Administration's "reinventing government"
initiative through such efforts as coordinating the Program's utilization of the Internet.
<p>
In Fiscal Year 1996, primary emphasis will be placed on program-wide information management
planning and integration, mission-critical support for business and management centers, and
essential productivity enhancements which, in light of current budgetary and resource constraints,
have assumed increased importance. The Program will:
<p>
<ul>
<li> Develop a program-wide information management multi-year plan which will outline
specific information management actions to support the revised program objectives.
<li> Initiate the development of a program-wide information architecture to ensure integration
and integrity of technical, regulatory, management, and financial data.
<li>  Make business process improvement a top information management priority, beginning
with the identification and elimination of duplicative and overlapping information systems.
<li> Develop an approach to meeting program-wide records processing requirements in
support of the Program's licensing schedule.
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Financial Resources</strong><br>

Activities associated with financial management of the Nuclear Waste Fund include management
of the Fund's investment portfolio and development and monthly implementation of appropriate
investment strategies. In the past year, the Nuclear Waste Fund has outperformed the
intermediate-term Treasury Bond Fund index. The Program's financial statements on the Fund
will continue to be audited annually by an independent certified public accounting firm.
<p>
The Program will conduct fee adequacy analyses to determine whether fees being paid by waste
generating sources are sufficient to fund the Program throughout its entire life cycle. The Fiscal
Year 1996 analysis will be based, in part, on the 1995 <em>Analysis of the Total System Life Cycle
Cost of the Civilian Radioactive Waste Management Program</em>. In Fiscal Year 1997, the 1995
total system life cycle cost estimate will be updated. 
<p>
<h4>2.3.7     International Waste Management Activities</h4>
<p>
The Program's international waste management activities involve cooperation with other
countries and international organizations to exchange information and develop consensus on
common issues. During Fiscal Year 1996, the Program will continue to participate in bilateral
agreements with Canada, Sweden, Switzerland, France, Japan, and Spain to support the exchange
of waste management information. The Program will continue limited interactions with the
International Atomic Energy Agency and Nuclear Energy Agency. Due to funding constraints,
the Program has terminated cooperative research agreements with Sweden, Switzerland, and
Canada to develop information and technology relevant to the characterization of a potential
geologic repository at Yucca Mountain. Financial support for international cooperative science
and technology programs is expected to be minimal in future years.
<p>
<h4>2.3.8     Program Management Milestones and Funding Requirements</h4>
<p>
Program management activities contribute to accomplishing the milestone objectives for the
Yucca Mountain Site Characterization Project and the Waste Acceptance, Storage, and
Transportation Project (described in <em><a href="./ch21.htm">Sections</em> 2.1.5, </a>page 58, and <a href="./ch22.htm">2.2.3,</a> page 68, respectively).
Many milestones specific to program management are either annual requirements or activities
related to effective implementation of the Program. The 1996-1999 Program Management
milestones are listed below and the funding requirements are shown in <a href="./table6.jpg"<em>Table 6 </em></a>on the following
page. The Fiscal Year 1996 dollars reflect the Program's Congressional appropriation, the Fiscal
Year 1997 dollars reflect the Administration's Fiscal Year 1997 budget request, and the Fiscal
Year 1998-1999 dollars reflect out-year funding requirements for the revised program strategy. 
<p>
<em>Fiscal Years 1996 - 1999</em><br>
<ul>
<li>Modify the Program's cost, schedule, and workscope baselines, work breakdown
structure, schedule networks, and bases of estimates to reflect the revised program strategy
<li> Increase staff capability through the continued implementation of the career development
program and the development of a process for retraining employees to meet current and future
job requirements 
<li> Conduct fee adequacy analysis and publish the report
<li> Develop and submit to the Congress an annual report on activities and expenditures of the
Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management during the previous fiscal year <em>(annual
requirement of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982)</em>

<html><head><title>Message from the Director</title></head>
<body><h2>Message from the Director</h2>
<hr>
<strong>Background </strong><br>
In December of 1994, as the product of an extensive review of the Program, consultation with a
broad spectrum of stakeholders, and a comprehensive strategic planning cycle, we published the
<em>Civilian Radioactive Waste Management Program Plan</em>. That plan outlined an approach to
accomplish the principal objectives of the Program with reasonable target dates and at substantially
reduced cost compared to earlier estimates. It remained, however, within the statutory and regulatory
framework governing the site suitability process for the Yucca Mountain Site Characterization
Project and preserved the programmatic expectations and definitions that had evolved from that
framework. 
<p>
The Administration proposed the new program approach in its Fiscal Year 1995 budget request and
the Congress approved the funding for the first year of the Program, a 37 percent increase over the
previous fiscal year. Utilizing the Fiscal Year 1995 funding, and drawing upon the extensive
scientific and analytical work already available, we have made a great deal of progress. 
<p>
The Yucca Mountain Project completed a total system performance assessment that provides
important insights into the critical factors that will affect the ability of the engineered and geologic
features of a repository to meet long-term standards of public health and safety. Guided by these
insights we are refining a waste containment and isolation strategy that, in turn, will focus the future
scientific and engineering work on the critical factors. We will emphasize the scientific data
collection and analyses required to confirm the hypotheses underlying the waste isolation strategy
and concentrate our near-term design effort on the critical technological requirements of the
engineered barriers. Finally, the exploratory tunnel has penetrated the repository formation itself and
is beginning to provide solid confirmation of the general theory of the site conditions that has been
developed from surface indications, drilling, and seismic work. 
<p>
With regard to the Program's waste acceptance responsibilities, any future scenario of at-reactor
storage, consolidated interim storage, and ultimate disposal will require an extensive transportation
effort to remove spent fuel from reactor sites. A new generation of storage and transportation casks
and canisters will have to be available to provide a comprehensive ability to service all fuel and all
sites, to enhance standardization of equipment and operations, and to improve system-wide
economics. In Fiscal Year 1995, the Program continued its work on transportation casks and initiated
a major contract intended to make the first high-capacity, comprehensive multi-purpose canister
system available to the marketplace by 1998. 
<p>
<strong>Fiscal Year 1996 Funding Impacts </strong><br>

The Fiscal Year 1996 appropriation to the Program did not support the continuation of that program
approach. Instead, the funding made available to the Program for expenditure is about 40 percent
below the Fiscal Year 1995 level. The Congressional guidance accompanying the appropriation was
to concentrate the work at Yucca Mountain on the most significant outstanding technical and
engineering issues and to defer licensing activities as required by the funding constraint. 
<p>
A portion of the appropriation was withheld from expenditure pending the enactment of new
authorizing legislation addressing interim storage. That legislation has not yet been enacted. 
<p>
The Program's first responsibility was to reduce its rate of expenditure to meet the restrictions of the
Fiscal Year 1996 appropriation. In doing so, the Congressional guidance was followed. To the extent
possible, the continuity of the core scientific work at Yucca Mountain, including progress on the
underground exploration, has been preserved. Outside of the Yucca Mountain Project, the Program
activities have been reduced to carrying out its responsibilities for oversight of the Nuclear Waste
Fund and of the contractual arrangements with nuclear utilities; limited coordination with
transportation-related organizations; and only the necessary program-wide planning, management
and administrative functions. Canister technology development activities have had to be terminated.
<p>
<strong>Proposed Future Program </strong>
<br>
Planning for the Administration's Fiscal Year 1997 budget request had been initiated prior to the
final 1996 appropriation action. In response to the new funding situation, the Program and the
Administration immediately had to decide upon a long-term program plan to support the Fiscal Year
1997 budget request for the Program. There were three potential directions that could be considered
for the Yucca Mountain Site Characterization Project: 
<ul>
<li>     propose to return to the funding levels required to reestablish the previous program approach;
<li>    consistent with Congressional guidance and the Fiscal Year 1996 funding level, convert the
Project to a long-term research effort without firm targets for repository licensing; or 
<li>     prepare a new, more concentrated program plan that can regain a target for a license application within a reasonable time, but which requires only moderately increased funding in future years. 
</ul>
The Administration has chosen the third option and has incorporated it into the Fiscal Year 1997
budget proposal now pending before the Congress. The strong foundation of strategic planning that
we had already developed and the recent convergence of more than a decade of scientific and
engineering work at the site have made that option feasible. 
<p>
In accordance with the Secretary's objectives for re-engineering of the Department and greater
privatization, and consistent with the direction of the policy debate taking place in the Congress, we
have also revised our program approach for the waste acceptance, storage, and transportation
activities. We will place greater reliance upon the marketplace and utilize appropriately structured
contractual arrangements to acquire the needed technologies and the logistical capability to carry out
these responsibilities.  
<p>
The revision to our December 1994 Program Plan presented in this document outlines the revised
approach that is associated with the Administration's Fiscal Year 1997 budget request. The necessity
to respond quickly to the unanticipated Fiscal Year 1996 appropriation actions and to concurrently
develop a Fiscal Year 1997 budget proposal foreclosed the opportunity for an extensive consultative
process during the development of this plan. The new plan, however, flows naturally from previous
planning efforts. Its essential elements will be familiar to those who have closely followed our
strategic planning process and the implementation of the Program in Fiscal Years 1995 and 1996.
The major policy redirections have evolved out of the Congressional appropriations process in which
many of our stakeholders have actively participated. 
<p>
In this document we describe the work plan and schedule we propose to pursue. In a formal
rulemaking that will be initiated soon, we will propose, and consider comments on, the process for
completing the site suitability determination and the possible subsequent activities leading to a
license application for the Yucca Mountain Site Characterization Project. We also will soon be
initiating preliminary discussions with potential participants in the transportation service
procurement process. If the Congress approves our Fiscal Year 1997 budget request, we will
continue the Environmental Impact Statement process for the Yucca Mountain Project that has been
suspended in Fiscal Year 1996. These formal processes, together with the continuing regular
interactions with our oversight bodies and stakeholders, will provide the comment and advice we
need to further refine the plan. 
<p>
The program approach outlined in this document is consistent with the statutory basis for the
Program and with our organizational mission. It preserves the essential program objectives, and it
serves the needs of our customers within the authorities given us. It rests upon several key premises. 
<p>
The Yucca Mountain Project will strive to reach an early conclusion of the site investigation. We
will concentrate our resources on the most significant outstanding technical issues first. By 1998,
we will assemble the wealth of scientific data already available in a system performance assessment
to evaluate the behavior of a repository in the geologic setting. With focused design efforts we will
ascertain that the technologies exist to construct a repository in that setting. We will also assess the
technical, economic, and practical feasibility of the licensing and construction of the repository. If
the repository appears to be viable, we will complete the work and pursue the process required by
the Nuclear Waste Policy Act to make a formal recommendation of the site to the President and to
present an acceptable license application to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission by the year 2002.
<p>
Concurrently, we will develop an approach and a capability to transport and store spent nuclear fuel
with the greatest possible reliance upon the marketplace. 
<p>
This approach is an appropriate modification of our Program to reflect the increased comprehension
of the Yucca Mountain site, the current outlook for Federal budgetary policy in general, and the
ongoing policy process concerning civilian radioactive waste management in particular.

<FONT SIZE=6><B>Introduction</B></FONT>
<IMG SRC="http://www.uilondon.org/bluline.gif" WIDTH=100%>
<P>All industrial activities, including generation of electricity, produce waste.  These wastes have to be stored and disposed of in ways which safeguard human health and protect the environment.  One of the key questions asked about nuclear power production is whether the industry can manage its waste safely and economically.
<P>
Nuclear power differs from other thermal electricity generation, for example burning fossil fuels, in producing a much larger amount of energy from a much smaller amount of fuel.  This means that it gives rise to a much smaller volume of waste, even when the extra waste produced when reactors are decommissioned is taken into account.  However, much of this waste is radioactive and, like many other wastes, could be damaging to health and the environment if not properly managed.
<P>
Different kinds of radioactive waste have very different levels of radioactivity and therefore very different management requirements.  A large proportion of all radioactive waste is of similar to or not very much higher radioactivity than the natural background.  A small proportion of the rest is highly radioactive and requires particularly careful management. 
Even this highly radioactive waste is not dangerous for ever, because radioactivity decays over time.  However, management must take account of long term safety, since some radioisotopes take a very long time to decay.  This long term decay, which can take millions of years, focused attention for the first time on the need for some wastes to be managed for a very long time beyond the lifetime of those who generated the waste.  Long-lived radioactive waste was the first type of persistently dangerous waste for which this need, and the questions it raises about equity between generations, were considered, leading to measures being taken to safeguard future generations.  Now the need for long term management for some other, non-radioactive, wastes, which may never lose their toxicity, is becoming more widely appreciated. 
<P>
Final disposal is only the last step in the waste management process, after collection, treatment, conditioning, storage and transport - steps which are technically well developed to a high level.  For highly radioactive waste, since heat output and radioactivity reduce with time, storage of the waste for some decades before final disposal greatly simplifies the technical requirements for it, and reduces radiological risks.  Final disposal facilities for this waste were therefore not required at once.  However, the consequent delay in putting them into place and the variety of facilities proposed, together with public confusion about the differences in the kinds of waste, have led to a widespread misconception that the nuclear industry does not know what to do with its waste, nor what the cost of dealing with it will be.  This has led to questions about the viability of the nuclear industry.  There is no technical reason for further delay in preparing to construct final disposal facilities, and therefore site investigations are needed now. 
<P>This paper reviews what the different types of waste are, what the technical consensus is on the requirements for their safe management, and how the present state of knowledge developed.  It describes in a little more depth how radioactive waste management is practised and planned within the fuel cycle and then indicates the moderate scale of the costs in relation to the total cost of producing electricity.  Country annexes give more information about what is being done in a selection of countries, in order to indicate how radioactive waste management is carried out in practice.

<BODY BGCOLOR="#ffffcc">
<FONT SIZE=6><B>Costs of radioactive waste management</B></FONT>
<IMG SRC="http://www.uilondon.org/bluline.gif" WIDTH=100%>
<P>
Financial provisions are now being made for management of civilian radioactive waste of all kinds.  The costs represent a small share of the total costs of the electricity generated, even where more expensive solutions than are really necessary are decided upon. 
<P>
Costs of current waste management consist mainly of: 
<UL>
<LI>treatment of spent fuel and radioactive waste (reprocessing, immobilization, encapsulation),
<LI>construction and operation of final repositories,
<LI>decommissioning and dismantling of nuclear power plants.
</UL>
Costs of nuclear waste management can be estimated with a reasonable degree of confidence on the basis of the detailed technical plans worked out, even for facilities to be commissioned a considerable time in the future.  Contingency allowances are added to the basic estimates in order to ensure the adequacy of the final estimates. 
<P>
Past experience of the costs of structures and systems at existing nuclear waste management facilities, or of other comparable facilities can be used in estimating future costs. For estimating the costs of encapsulating plants, cost data for similar activities at nuclear power plants and interim storage facilities are appropriate.  Experience of constructing final repositories in rock for low and intermediate level radioactive waste, and of constructing other rock caverns, for example for mines or for oil reservoirs, gives a basis for evaluating the reliability of cost estimates of used fuel or high level waste repositories. 
<P>
A few international examples of undiscounted cost estimates of nuclear waste management follow. 
<P>
In Germany, it is planned to use the Gorleben repository for disposal of all types of waste, but especially high level wastes.  Low level wastes with small enough heat output to have a negligible thermal impact on the host rock formation will be placed in the Konrad repository.  The cost estimate, based on waste from 4000 TWh electricity production for construction of the two repositories are US$ 2500 million (DM 5000 million), and for annual operation is US$ 90 million (DM 170 million).  The costs of construction and operation of these repositories account for about 1 mill/kWh (0.002DM/kWh) of nuclear electricity. 
<P>
In Finland, a cost estimate has been worked out for the total waste management system corresponding to production of 430TWh (the two power plants at Olkiluoto).  The costs, including used fuel management (interim storage, encapsulation and direct disposal), final disposal of operating low and intermediate level wastes, decommissioning and final disposal of the decommissioning wastes as well as research and development work are US$ 1600 million (FIM 5800 million) or about 4 mills/kWh. 
<P>
In most countries, cost estimates for decommissioning a 1000 MW LWR are between US$ 100 - 200 million.  The costs of decommissioning and of disposal of subsequent decommissioning wastes typically account for about 0.5 mill/kWh of the cost of electricity. 
<P>
It is necessary to make financial provisions in advance, as a significant part of the waste management costs will arise after the power plants to which they relate have finished operation.  Systematic financial provisions have been made in most countries, in many cases by setting up state controlled funds, and collecting the finance necessary for fully providing for the costs of future waste management in the price of electricity during electricity production.

<BODY BGCOLOR="#ffffcc">
<FONT SIZE=6><B>Safety requirements for managing radioactive waste</B></FONT>
<IMG SRC="http://www.uilondon.org/bluline.gif" WIDTH=100%>
<P>
There is a high degree of consensus about the general principles governing radioactive waste management.  The general objective is to manage the waste in such a way as to protect human health and the environment and to limit any burden placed on future generations. 
<P>
The internationally accepted way to achieve this is to process any waste which is not already in a stable solid form into such a form, to encase it, and to place it in a near surface or an underground disposal facility, according to the characteristics of the waste.  (Where appropriate, these steps may take place after periods of storage which reduce handling and disposal problems.) The 'multi-barrier approach' used is designed to keep the radioactive substances away from people's environment with a series of separate physical and chemical barriers until the process of radioactive decay makes them barely distinguishable from naturally occurring materials.  The multi-barrier approach sets standards for the safe disposal of radioactive waste which go far beyond those now applied to the disposal of other toxic and hazardous wastes. 
<P>
The principles governing radiological protection are that activities released and resultant doses must be limited to those that: 
<UL>
<LI>are justified by a net benefit - for waste, the benefit is considered in the context of the whole nuclear energy production process and other uses of radioactive substances;
<LI>optimise protection according to the principle of keeping all exposures as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA), economic and social factors being taken into account - for waste this mostly applies to choices of options, for example, between delayed and immediate final disposal;
<LI>keep risks to individuals at acceptable levels. 
</UL>
There are systems of notification, registration and licensing to ensure fulfilment of these principles by keeping to the regulations and standards laid down by the internal and national control institutions to ensure adequate safety for the present and future. 
<P>
The principles governing radioactive waste management are not confined to radiological protection and the protection of the environment and natural resources, but also cover ethical and social considerations, and, where appropriate, non-proliferation safeguards. 
<P>
The ethical and sociological principles are care for others, including future generations, the 'pay if you pollute' principle, and compensation for any damage (civil liability). Protection of environmental and natural resources includes the prevention and rectification of damage. 
<P>
The purpose of non-proliferation safeguards is to prevent the improper diversion of nuclear materials to military purposes.  <A HREF="http://www.uilondon.org/safetab.html">States party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty</A> accept International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) verification of their fulfilment of their obligations under the treaty. 
<P>
National strategies for waste management differ considerably.  This reflects the availability of a choice of methods for achieving the same objectives and fulfilling the same principles rather than any uncertainty about whether they can be achieved.  An adequate level of safety can be assessed and ensured in a number of different ways.

<IMG SRC="http://www.uilondon.org/bluline.gif" WIDTH=100%>
<P>
Radioactive wastes can be safely and economically dealt with by a variety of known methods all of which fulfil the same broad principles.  There is international consensus on these principles, whose goal is to ensure that all these radioactive wastes are managed so that human health and the environment are protected now and in the future without placing an unacceptable burden on later generations.  The crucial problem is public confidence:  there has been a failure to communicate that adequate ways are known of managing radioactive wastes with responsibility towards the present and future generations at reasonable cost. 
<P>
Broad knowledge exists on methods that will achieve these objectives, and on the scale of their costs.  Short lived waste, which forms the bulk of all the waste, is already taken care of on an industrial scale.  Facilities for final disposal of the very small quantity of high level long-lived radioactive waste have not been urgently required, because initial storage minimises the total radiation exposures from all management of this wastes, including final disposal.  However, taking into account the length of time needed to completion of construction of final repositories, the time has now come to start.  What is needed is for the industry to earn the confidence of the public and for governments to support the steps necessary for this start to be made.  The technological knowledge to site, build and operate the facilities and estimate their costs exists. They can be built and managed at reasonable costs in relation to the costs of the associated electricity generation. 
<P>
<I>Facts which should be known about radioactive wastes and their management:</I>
<UL>
<LI>Amounts are relatively small
<LI>High level waste is an extremely small part of the total.
<LI>Radioactivity can be very precisely measured
<LI>Toxicity of radioactive materials decreases with time
<LI>Most of the toxicity of radioactive materials disappears soon
<LI>Much is known about the effects of radioactivity on people
<LI>Safe, proven temporary storage methods for all wastes exist
<LI>Final disposal facilities exist for short-lived waste
<LI>Safe methods for high level waste final disposal are known
<LI>Information on techniques is internationally exchanged
<LI>Only a minor part of nuclear electricity costs is for waste

<P>
There are proven and safe technologies for managing medium and low level waste, and for storing high level long-lived waste for long enough for heat output and radioactivity from it to have reduced enough to simplify final disposal greatly.  These technologies have existed and been used since the early 1970s. The physical facilities for the last stage of managing high level and long-lived waste - final disposal - were not built, because there was no urgent technological need for them and there was well grounded confidence in the potential for a safe solution when needed. 
<P>
However, the lack of defined plans for the long term management of this waste, reinforced by lack of public understanding of the very significant differences in the potential hazard from different types of radioactive waste, has had an important effect on public confidence in the handling of all radioactive waste, not just high level and long-lived waste. 
<P>
Later, long term safety assessments extended the criteria for management according to the principle that risks we are not prepared to accept today should not be passed on to future generations.  The demand made next that the waste should be guaranteed never to cause any harm whatever to the environment, however small and unlikely, was not expected.  This demand had not been imposed on any activities before, and it seems desirable that the consequences of the profound effect on all present technology if it were extended to the rest of industry and other human activities, should be carefully considered. 
<P>
In the 1970s and 1980s, major efforts have been put into defining long term nuclear waste management policy.  It is almost certain that more effort and resources have been devoted to finding an acceptable and safe disposal route for radioactive wastes than for any other kind of waste.  At present, disposal of radioactive waste is subject to far more stringent controls than have yet been introduced for other waste, even where this other waste is permanently highly toxic. 
<P>
Today, there is broad theoretical and practical knowledge on the answers to all the important questions about radioactive waste management. 
<P>
The theoretical knowledge is backed up by experience of processes comparable to those that will occur in the repository and by study of analogous natural systems, such as the 2000 million year old deposit of natural spent fuel at Oklo in Gabon or the extremely rich uranium ore immobilized in a natural clay backfill at Cigar Lake in Canada. 
<P>
Research and development, nationally and internationally, have been intensified, and the results show that the industry has the knowledge to build facilities that will isolate waste where necessary for a long time ahead and also under drastically changed conditions.  Countries are ready with the technology to build and operate facilities when they are needed. 
<P>
In France, Canada, the UK and the USA, shallow land burial has been used almost as long as nuclear production.  A modern variant taking advantage of experience and technological progress is near surface disposal in engineered structures. This is now being implemented or planned more widely, for example in Spain and Japan.
<P>
Underground facilities are also in existence.  In Germany, low and intermediate waste has been disposed of on an industrial scale in two former salt mines, Asse (R&amp;D facility) and Morsleben.  The bulk of this waste is now in intermediate storage facilities, and is intended to be finally disposed of in the abandoned Konrad iron ore mine, which is in an advanced stage of licensing.  In Sweden, a permanent repository for intermediate and low level waste has been operating since 1988, and in Finland construction has begun.  In the USA, construction of the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) near Carlsbad, New Mexico, has been completed.  It is an R&amp;D facility to demonstrate safe disposal of transuranic wastes in a deep salt formation.  The test phase with waste is to begin by the end of July 1991.

<FONT SIZE=6><B>The nature and classification of radioactive waste</B></FONT>
<IMG SRC="http://www.uilondon.org/bluline.gif" WIDTH=100%>
<P>
All parts of the nuclear fuel cycle, from uranium mining and preparing fuel for use, through use of the fuel to generate electricity, to management of used fuel and decommissioning, produce some radioactive waste.  This waste comprises a diversity of materials with different physical, chemical and radioactive characteristics, requiring different types of management. 
<P>The broad characteristics of radioactive waste that affect what effects it could have and how it should be managed are: 
<UL>
<LI>how long the radioactivity lasts (the content of short or long-lived radionuclides)
<LI>the concentration of the radionuclides, (high, medium or low level)
<LI>whether it is heat generating or not (which is related to the concentration of the radionuclides)
</UL>
The length of life of the radioactivity determines how long it has to be managed.  The concentration of the radionuclides and whether it is heat generating dictates how it should be handled:  how much, if any, shielding is needed.  These considerations together determine what ways of disposal are suitable. 
<P>
The main categories of waste from the nuclear fuel cycle are: 
<OL TYPE=i, ii, iii, ...>
<LI>The residues left from processing uranium ore.  These contain naturally occurring radioactive elements mined with the uranium, and some chemicals used in the separation process.  The radioactivity is low level but long-lived. 
<LI>The materials and equipment (for example protective clothing, cleaning materials, ion-exchange resins) which become contaminated during the operation of nuclear facilities.  The radioactivity is mainly low level and short-lived. 
<LI>The wastes arising from nuclear fuel after it has been used in a reactor.  These can be the used fuel itself if it is not reprocessed or the wastes resulting from reprocessing the used fuel so that it can be recycled for reuse.  Used fuel that is not to be reprocessed can be regarded as high level, long-lived waste.  Reprocessing wastes are a mixture of high, intermediate and low level wastes, including long-lived intermediate level wastes:  the mixture depends on the treatment techniques used. 
<LI>The wastes resulting from dismantling nuclear reactors after the fuel has been removed and from fuel processing plants at the end of their operating lives.  The radioactivity is low and intermediate level and mainly relatively short-lived.  There will be some long-lived waste from dismantling reprocessing plants. 
</OL>
The high level wastes in category iii account for almost all (some 99 per cent) of the radioactivity produced by nuclear electricity generation, but a very small proportion of the total volume of waste, which is itself very small (especially if there is reprocessing) in comparison to wastes from other forms of thermal electricity generation.  Since it is such a small volume, it can be effectively and economically isolated.  The long-lived but low level wastes from processing uranium ore account for most of the volume of all radioactive wastes - 50 to 100 times as much as the rest- but very little of the radioactivity.
<P>
Additional civilian radioactive wastes arise from medicine, industry and research.  These may be very heterogeneous and can contain long-lived radionuclides.
<P>
An important reason why the volume of all waste from use of nuclear power is small in comparison to that from other forms of thermal electricity generation is that nuclear power produces very much more energy from a given amount of fuel.  A pellet of nuclear fuel less than a centimetre in diameter and one and a half centimetres long has about as much energy available as over 450 cubic metres of natural gas or one tonne of coal;  and a 1300 MWe coal fired power plant would use over 50 000 times the tonnage of fuel it would need if it were nuclear powered.  This more than outweighs the fact that production and use of coal generates less solid waste per tonne of fuel.  (The very large amount of greenhouse gases from production and use of fossil fuels and the negligible amount from production and use of nuclear fuel are not taken into account.)
<P>
All countries manage the different kinds of waste to take full account of their characteristics, but the classifications they use for the waste differ somewhat in accordance with the systems they use.  Since this may be causing some confusion to the public, standardised international waste classifications could be helpful in explaining what is being done and why it is consistent between countries in achieving the same goals. 
<P>It is helpful that a <A HREF="http://www.nea.fr/html/rwm/geodisp.html">Collective Opinion</A> on the methodology and means for assessing the safety of radioactive waste disposal practices and concepts has been arrived at and published by the Radioactive Waste Management Committee of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Nuclear Energy Agency (OECD/NEA) and the International Radioactive Waste Management Advisory Committee of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), with the endorsement of the experts for the Community Plan of Action in the Field of Radioactive Waste Management of the Commission of the European Communities (CEC).
<P>
<B>The Collective Opinion:</B>
<UL>
<LI>confirmed that safety assessment methods are available today to evaluate adequately the potential long-term radiological impacts of a carefully designed radioactive waste disposal system on humans and the environment, and
<LI>considered that appropriate use of safety assessment methods, coupled with sufficient information from proposed disposal sites, can provide the technical basis to decide whether specific disposal systems would offer to society a satisfactory level of safety for both current and future generations.

<FONT SIZE=6><B>The need for isolation:  the harmful effects of radiation</B></FONT>
<IMG SRC="http://www.uilondon.org/bluline.gif" WIDTH=100%>
<P>
Ionizing radiation can have a significant effect on biological processes:  it can therefore damage living organisms. Regulations on radiation exposures limit the amount of radiation that can be received by workers in the industry and the general public in any one year and in a lifetime.  Isolation of waste protects against radiation exposures. 
<P>
The risk from radioactive wastes is predominantly that of direct radiation exposure to nuclear industry workers in their working environment before disposal.  After disposal, slow degradation of repository systems may lead to a small risk of exposure to the general public principally through possible leakage into groundwater.  Disposal sites are studied to establish the movement of the groundwater in order to minimise the extent of this possible leakage.  Assessments already carried out in various countries to evaluate the safety of nuclear fuel disposal have concluded that even in the worst case future human exposure to ionising radiation from a deep geological repository would be much less than that received continuously from natural background radiation. 
<P>There is a misconception that radioactive waste can be a major problem for a million years.  After that time, the only radioactivity left will be from the long-lived isotopes such as the actinides and from the shorter-lived products of their breakdown.  Amounts will depend on whether the used fuel has been directly disposed of or reprocessed and vitrified.  The potential risk from the waste declines over time with the radioactivity, and with it the need for isolation lessens. This is particularly true for the elements, like most of the fission products, that have more demanding isolation requirements. Their decay will be almost entirely complete within one thousand years. The transuranic elements like plutonium stay toxic for longer, but are less demanding to isolate.  Therefore, the growing uncertainty about future protection of disposal sites as time passes is matched by the declining risk from the waste. 
<P>In contrast, many non-radioactive wastes routinely produced in other industries are stable, which means they never decay and never lose their toxicity.

<IMG SRC="http://www.uilondon.org/bluline.gif" WIDTH=100%>
<P>
Uranium makes up 4 parts per million of the earth's crust and is found in a wide range of geological and climatic environments and in many minerals, often associated with a variety of other metals.  Each deposit has a unique mix of geographic, chemical and radioactive features which must be taken into account in the design, operation and shutdown of mining operations, and which will determine the waste management strategies adopted. 
<P>
Some uranium is produced by <A HREF="http://www.uilondon.org/orebrief.html#insitu">in situ leach mining</A>.  In this, liquid is pumped down for the uranium to dissolve in, then pumped up again and through a column of ion exchange resin beads to extract the uranium, and then reused.  A small percentage more liquid is pumped up than down, so a little of the groundwater is drawn in to the mining zone, and the chemicals pumped down are confined to the mining zone.  This method produces a very small volume of liquid waste, but is only possible in certain geologic formations. 
<P>
However, most mining is <A HREF="http://www.uilondon.org/orebrief.html#surface">surface</A> or <A HREF="http://www.uilondon.org/orebrief.html#under">underground</A> removal of ore.  The crude uranium ore is fed into a series of crushing mills and the uranium is extracted using an acid or alkali leach process.  The wastes are composed of excavated rock with too low a uranium content for economic extraction (mine wastes), and material from the uranium extraction process (mill tailings). Tailings contain particles ranging in size from coarse, sandy material to very fine dusts.  They are normally handled as a slurry with water containing 25 to 40 per cent solids and residual processing chemicals. 
<P>
Most uranium ores contain between 0.05 and 0.2 per cent uranium, although some high grade ores may contain 15 per cent uranium or more, so the recovery of one kilogram of uranium could produce as much as two tonnes of tailings.  Except for the added processing chemicals, the tailings are inherently less hazardous than the parent ore.  However, the process of grinding and chemical treatment facilitates leaching from the ore, so that it is more likely to release soluble materials into the environment.  Waste management measures must control materials which pose radioactive or non-radioactive hazards. 
<P>
The precise chemical composition of the tailings will depend on the mineralogy of the orebody.  The radioactivity of the tailings is proportional to the ore grade.  About 15 per cent of the total radioactivity contained in the ore is accounted for in the product from the uranium mill, the other 85 per cent, consisting of uranium decay products,is discharged with the tailings. 
<P>
The principal radioactive materials present are thorium-230, radium-226, lead-210 and other radon daughters (that is, products of the decay of radon).  Thorium has a long half-life of 80 000 years, but, like lead whose half-life is only 22.3 years, is precipitated into a solid and remains inert in the tailings basin.  Although the dissolved radium is reduced by this precipitation, the mill effluent if not treated may still contain concentrations which are unacceptable for release to the environment.  Radium-226 is also a long-lived radioactive element, having a half-life of 1622 years.  It therefore requires long term control.  Radon-222 is produced from the decay of radium.  It is a short lived, inert gas, with a half life of 3.8 days.  It decays to solid radioactive polonium, bismuth and lead, which may become associated with airborne dust particles and hazardous if inhaled.  Its release into the atmosphere, when higher than acceptable, must therefore be controlled by covering or otherwise stabilising the tailings. 
<P>
Most tailings are not highly radioactive and would normally be classified as low-level waste, although some from high grade ores may reach intermediate-level activity.  The risk from direct radiation exposure from tailings is small, especially if access to the management areas is restricted. 
<P>
The non-radioactive contaminants in the tailings are similar to those from other base metal mining operations.  These materials may affect the biosphere, and so need careful handling to control their release.  They may also be accumulated in the tissues of lower plant and animal organisms, and so enter the food chain and endanger birds and mammals and, possibly, humans. 
<P>
In the early years of the uranium mining industry, measures for tailings disposal, following generally accepted mining industry practices, mainly considered location, economics, size and containment.  During the 1970s and 1980s increasingly stringent regulations have been introduced to control the release of radioactive materials into the environment.  In addition, the industry itself has begun to develop practices which ensure high quality containment with minimal environmental impact, and there is a growing effort to improve measures for long term containment.  Studies have shown that uranium mining is no more harmful to the environment than other base metal mining, which may be less stringently regulated. 
<P>
Methods for conditioning tailings to reduce harmful effects on the environment are directed towards recycling of the waste waters, precipitation and removal of radium from solution, and neutralisation to precipitate heavy metals.  The slurry is usually transported to an impoundment basin where the solid particles settle out, and the effluent is treated for removal of contaminants before discharge into a settling pond.  Treatment ponds may contain low permeability liners where appropriate to control seepage.  Barium chloride may be added to the tailings to precipitate dissolved radium-226 as radium-barium sulphate. Lime and limestone may be added to the tailings to raise the pH. Research is continuing in the industry into methods for further removing the contaminants during the mill process. 
<P>
Long term management practice must take account of the climate and geography of the surrounding region and the potential for earthquakes or flooding.  In the wet, temperate climate of the Elliot Lake mine in Canada, large volumes of effluent may be discharged, especially during the spring runoff. In contrast, in the hot, desert conditions of Namibia and also in some central US mines, wind borne dust is the major waste management problem. 
<P>
Several management options are currently practised: surface storage, shallow or deeper burial, and underwater disposal.  Surface storage is usually at the place where the tailings are deposited.  It necessitates covering and stabilising the tailings.  In shallow burial, the tailings are stored in a natural or constructed depression and covered with up to three metres of earth fill to reduce erosion and restrict radon release.  Using tailings for mine backfill or placing them in the pit of a surface mining facility is deep burial.  This is particularly appropriate for tailings from high grade ores. Finally, tailings may be disposed of under deep enough water to suppress sulphide oxidation and radon release into the atmosphere, for example at the bottom of lakes. 
<P>
Where uranium is mined as a by-product of other mining, the processes are essentially the same, but the ore is usually lower grade, so the intrinsic problems from the uranium are rather less. 
<P>
Decommissioning and reclamation of uranium mines is increasingly becoming the subject of detailed planning.  In the past, a mine might be closed with no special remedial measures to ensure that the remaining materials and infrastructure posed no hazard to the general population or to the environment.  Now, plans for eventual reclamation are an integral part of the mine development process.  In addition to generally accepted engineering practices, including demolishing buildings and sealing mine shafts, measures are taken to stabilise the tailings surface and to control seepage, so controlling radium and radon releases to the environment.

<FONT SIZE=6><B>Used fuel management</B></FONT>
<IMG SRC="http://www.uilondon.org/bluline.gif" WIDTH=100%>
<P>
The two basic options for the management of used fuel are direct disposal or reprocessing.  These give rise to different radioactive residues. 
Used fuel for <I>direct disposal</I> is long-lived high level solid waste.  The whole fuel assembly is treated as waste.  It is stored and cooled until its radioactivity and heat output have reduced enough to simplify handling, before it is ready for packaging and final disposal.  These storage and subsequent conditioning operations generate intermediate and low level waste. 
<P>
Before <I>reprocessing</I>, the used fuel is stored for some five to ten years at reactor sites or reprocessing plants. During reprocessing, uranium and plutonium are separated.  The following intermediate and high level wastes will be generated during the different processes: 
<UL>
<LI>Liquid, high level, long-lived waste.  This is mainly the fission products and actinides other than uranium and plutonium. 
<LI>Liquid, intermediate level long-lived waste from the various separation processes.
<LI>Solid, intermediate level waste, such as fuel claddings etc.
</UL>
The methods used to deal with these are described later. In addition, there will be a variety of low-level wastes. 
<P>
Liquid, high level waste is stored in cooled tanks for a number of years before being solidified by a vitrification process.  Steel containers holding the vitrified waste are then stored, typically for 30 to 50 years, in air-cooled vaults for the decay heat to reduce.  Concepts for its final geological disposal have been developed, and its safety has been evaluated. 
<P>
Low and intermediate level liquid waste.  The effluents other than high level waste are sent to a waste treatment plant where they are stored in different tanks, depending on their nature.  Two types of treatment can be used for decontamination: chemical precipitation or evaporation.  Sludges, flocs and evaporator concentrates are solidified by being cast in cement, resins or bitumen. 
<P>
The waste is either finally disposed of or, more usually, temporarily stored pending final disposal in a repository. 
<P>
Solid wastes from reprocessing, such as fuel claddings, are encapsulated into cement or bitumen before storage or disposal.

<P>
The operation of a reactor generates long-lived high level used fuel, and short to medium-lived low and medium level operational waste.  The most radioactive operational wastes are filter and ion exchange resins from the reactor water purification systems.  Used tools, exchanged parts, protective clothes, and scrap are also operational waste.  The radioactivity of the operational waste is mainly due to relatively short-lived radionuclides such as cobalt-60 and caesium-137, which decay to safe levels after 200 to 300 years. 
<P>
The bulk of the operational waste is low level, and only very small amounts of long-lived waste may be included.  The intermediate level resins are normally dewatered, and stored or disposed of.  They may be immobilised with concrete, cement or bitumen.  The low level waste is usually compacted, using high pressure compaction or incineration with subsequent compaction of the ashes.

<P>
Most of the waste arising when decommissioning and dismantling old reactors is low level short-lived waste.  Large volumes can be decontaminated and declassified, and so be handled as normal industrial wastes.  Of the remaining waste, most is low level short-lived waste similar to operational waste, and so will have the same treatment and be disposed of in the same repositories. 
<P>
Only a small part of the waste in some internal parts of the reactor has relatively high activity.  Final disposal of these wastes can be in the same repositories as intermediate level operational wastes, with appropriate technical barriers, or as high level wastes.  Some will be encapsulated and disposed of in the same manner as directly disposed of used fuel.

<IMG SRC="http://www.uilondon.org/bluline.gif" WIDTH=100%>
<P>
The next stage is for the uranium concentrates to be refined and, where necessary converted into another oxide form, pure metal or uranium hexafluoride gas.  Natural uranium, which is largely made up of non-fissile uranium-238 and contains only 0.7% of fissile uranium-235, can be used as fuel in reactors where the moderator is heavy water or graphite.  The uranium used in light water reactors normally has its content of the fissile uranium-235 enriched to a few per cent of the total after conversion to uranium hexafluoride gas.  For enrichment, gas diffusion or ultra centrifuging may be used;  laser enrichment is being developed.  The enriched uranium hexafluoride is then converted to uranium dioxide powder. 
<P>
In fuel fabrication, the fuel is pressed into small cylinders which are enclosed in zirconium alloy, magnox or stainless steel tubes. These tubes are then assembled to form a fuel element.  If used fuel is reprocessed, plutonium and uranium can be recycled and fuel elements with a mixture of dioxides of uranium and plutonium can be produced. 
The most important material left after the enrichment process is fairly large amount of depleted uranium, normally about 80 to 85 per cent by weight of the natural uranium from which it arose.  The depleted uranium typically contains from 0.25 to 0.30 per cent of fissile uranium-235:  this content is determined solely by the economic balance between the costs of uranium and separative work.  All commercial enrichers keep it in temporary storage, normally at the enrichment plants, for possible re-work using more advanced enrichment technology.  In the longer term, it could be used for breeder reactors. 
<P>
Depleted uranium is a relatively harmless substance and the dangers there are from it are more from its chemical effects than from its radiation effects.  However, with time, depleted uranium, like natural uranium, decays and develops active daughter products which are more dangerous, radium-226 and radon-222.  It therefore requires long term management, and is stored completely confined in purpose designed steel containers. There have been 40 years experience of its safe storage.

<P>
Radioactive waste created at all stages after mining has to be transported.  It is transported in solid form, which presents fewer problems than the transport of liquids or gases. The legal requirements which exist for the transport of any other radioactive materials have to be satisfied.  All countries use a radioactive package classification based on IAEA recommendations.  Used fuel has been routinely transported by road, rail and sea for several decades in heavy casks, usually made of steel with a neutron absorbing layer and external cooling fins, which meet national and international safety standards and have had their integrity rigourously tested. There has been no accident with a release of radioactivity which has harmed people.

<IMG SRC="http://www.uilondon.org/bluline.gif" WIDTH=100%>
<P>
The use of radioisotopes in research centres, universities, industrial companies and in medicine results in a comparatively high volume of compressible or combustible substances such as plastic, paper and protective clothing, small metallic objects or crushed glassware, together with worn out or damaged equipment, metal components, air filters, debris and miscellaneous waste.  Accordingly, this type of waste is particularly characterised by a very heterogeneous composition, including a broad spectrum of materials, contaminants and specific activities.  Additional heterogenous radioactive wastes are produced from sources which do not directly involve radioisotopes, for example, particle accelerators. 
<P>
The radioactive waste from research, industry and medicine is either stored as primary waste or processed and packed according to its properties.  For immobilization, mainly cement and concrete are used.  For the packaging of the conditioned and unconditioned waste, drums are most often used.
<P>
This waste is not a very large proportion of total radioactive waste - in what used to be FR Germany it is about 3 per cent of the total and the use of radioisotopes in medicine contributes a minor share to this 3 per cent.  Important radionuclides are tritium, cobalt-60, carbon-14, americium-241, caesium-137 and iodine-121.  It can be classified as radioactive waste generating negligible heat.  However, there is a large number of establishments producing this waste, and for most of them, dealing with radioactivity is not central to their activities, so there is some potential for problems to arise, and effective regulatory control is essential.  The accident at Goiana in Brazil in September 1987, when a strongly radioactive caesium-137 source was removed from its protective housing in a teletherapy machine in an abandoned clinic, resulted in the deaths of four people and the generation of nearly 3500 cubic metres of radioactively contaminated waste.

<H3>Exploring the Future of In Situ Leach Uranium Mining. <A HREF="http://www.uilondon.org/uiabs95/akinbio.html">Hikmet Akin</A>.</H3>
<P>

In present day market conditions, US mining companies take uranium from only the lowest cost
deposits, and most US uranium production presently comes from ISL operations. In a graph of
mine productivity which shows number of pounds U<SMALL><SUB>3</SUB></SMALL>O<SMALL>
<SUB>8</SMALL></SUB> produced per employee per year, apart
from projects with high grade reserves such as Key Lake and Rabbit Lake, many of the most
productive units are US ISL operations.<P>

ISL operations in the US are reviewed as they provide the best example of the evolution of ISL
mining. Beginning in 1974, the method was at first restricted to sites too problematic for
conventional mining. Costs were at first high, (US$15-40 pound) but are now comparable to
conventional methods. Crow Butte mine is used to illustrate requirements for and developments
in ISL: situated in Nebraska, the project is owned by Uranerz, Geomex and KEPRA. Uranium-
bearing permeable Oligocene sandstones at depth 150-200 metres are overlain and capped by
impermeable clay and siltstone layers. The ore, grade 0.25% U<SMALL><SUB>3</SUB>
</SMALL>O<SMALL><SUB>8</SMALL></SUB>, occurs in horizons 1.5-4.5 m
thick, and reserves are estimated at 30 million pounds (11 500 tU). Extraction comprises firstly
oxidation: formational waters are fortified with soda ash and carbon dioxide to form a sodium
bicarbonate alkaline leach chemistry, then gaseous oxygen is added to the solution and it is
pumped into a series of injection wells; and secondly dissolution: the oxygen oxidises the uranium
causing it to dissolve and complex with the bicarbonate, the solution is pumped up the recovery
well and an ion exchanger removes the uranium from the water, giving saleable yellowcake. Water
from the processing plant is recycled back to the wellfields, and groundwater from the wellfields
is, by law, returned to its natural condition. In 1994, the US's four remaining ISL operations
produced around 2.5 million pounds U<SMALL><SUB>3</SUB></SMALL>O<SMALL>
<SUB>8</SMALL></SUB> (960 tU).<P>

Globally about 15% of world uranium originates from ISL mining. Countries with suitable
deposits include Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, possibly Mongolia and China, parts of eastern Europe,
and Australia. CIS operators use an acid rather than an alkaline leach process, and less aquifer
restoration measures are taken. Uzbekistan, which has significant uranium reserves in the
Kyzylkum Desert sandstone basins, expects to produce more if not all of its uranium through ISL
in future, as does Kazakhstan. These countries each produce annually about 7 to 8 million pounds
U<SMALL><SUB>3</SUB></SMALL>O<SMALL><SUB>8</SMALL></SUB> (2700 -3000 tU).<P>

Cooperation between Western and Central Asian producers, such as the envisaged Inkai
Production Joint Venture between KATEP of Kazakhstan and Uranerz and Cameco, will enhance
Central Asia's economic potential. ISL cannot compete economically with high grade production
projects, but for low grade resources, if certain conditions are met, ISL offers a chance of survival
in a difficult economic climate.<P>

 France, the USA and the UK. Marc Poumadere and Claire Mays.</TITLE></HEAD>

<H3>Sociocultural Factors in Public Acceptance: Comparative risk studies involving France, the USA and
 the UK. <A HREF="http://www.uilondon.org/uiabs95/poumbio.html">Marc Poumadere</A> and Claire Mays.</H3>



<P>
Nuclear energy production is a technology which concentrates public fears and concerns, and therefore
 the industry has originated several innovative approaches to risk analysis and management, and also to
 risk perception and communication.

<P>
Risk perception by members of the public relies upon intuitive judgements, which are influenced by the life
 experience and values of the person, and by media representations of hazards. More than 24 criteria affect
 the intuitive estimation of risk, and these are grouped into broad classes. Different social groupings give
 typically different risk ratings, eg., civilians give a higher risk rating than experts to civilian nuclear energy.
 People generally perceive there to be more risk  now than in the past, and believe that future risks will be
 even greater. Risk communication to the public should be pragmatic, consisting of real problem solving in
 context, not ready-made approaches.

<P>
A discussion follows of a comparative study of perceptions of risk associated with nuclear energy in France,
 a country noted for its apparently passive acceptance of the dominance of nuclear, and in the US. Topics
 such as knowledge and acceptance of nuclear development, perception of health risks, confidence in nuclear
 organisation, energy options, and world-views, were explored through telephone questionnaires in each country.
 Results are tabulated and discussed. The most striking contrast between the two countries was that although
 more of the French gave a high risk score to the top ranked public health risk, nuclear waste, than did the
 Americans, more of the French were happy to leave nuclear energy operation and its health risks to the
 experts. This is explained by the two countries' differing systems of democracy.

<P>
A similar study of attitudes to nuclear waste repositories at Sellafield and in France revealed the French
 to be more preoccupied with perceived risks. There appears to be a connection in both countries between
 waste management and social conflict, while at Sellafield, the data suggested that people had negative
 feelings about the repository but were unlikely to take action about them; they felt also that they possessed
 insufficient information and that their views would be disregarded. An information programme response to
 this situation is suggested, which would reassure residents, allow them to air their views in acceptable ways,
 and give them a tangible role in decision-making. 

<P>
Interviews with waste management communicators in this study pointed up the difficult transition between a
 traditional, authoritarian model of nuclear management and a new, socially responsive one. The UK's new 
model takes its authority from science, the French one from the people, through Parliament. These models
 are not universally applicable however. Research into risk perception must be continuous, and relationships 
built between public acceptance specialists, managers of risky technologies, and decision makers in government 
and industry.

<H3>Resource Development and the Environment: Opportunities in Economic
Development and Self-Determination for Indigenous Peoples. Oneill Gladue,
Ray Ahenakew, Vern Bachiu, Andrew Nellestyn &amp; Ty Rutzki. </H3>
<P>


The indigenous peoples forming Canada's nine Meadow Lake First Nations
(MLFNs) and the Meadow Lake Tribal Council (MLTC) are conducting a study  on
the feasibility and desirability of hosting a used nuclear fuel storage facility. The
MLTC has also initiated a programme of community consultation and information.<P>

The MLFNs number 9000 people, divided into two linguistically different cultural
groups. Each of the nine MLFNs is fully autnonomous. The MLTC provides policy
formulation, services and support for the MLFNs in health, social services,
education and economic development.The growth of the MLTC population requires
the provision of an extra 150 jobs per year for the next 20 years. The MLTC is
exploring the storage of nuclear fuel as an opportunity to provide long term, quality
employment, full and equal participation in the control and management of the
enterprise, environmental responsibility and sensitivity, and recognition of the
MLFNs' traditional values, culture and lifestyle.<P>
 
The MLTC chiefs commissioned a feasibility and desirability sudy to report on
safety, economic development potential, financing, impact on First Nations
traditions, job creation potential, and to determine whether the MLFN peoples
wanted the project to go ahead. The people of the MLFNs were ecouraged to
participate fully in the information programme and community consultation
activities. Two Economic Development Officers and nine Community Consultation
Assistants were appointed to conduct the surveys and explain the project to the
people. The MLTC also gained experience and knowledge by visiting tribes in the
USA and specialists inside and outside Canada.<P>
 
It was recognised that the MLFNs would need to start educating its own
technologists, scientists, engineers, administrators and managers in order to
become full participants in the Canadian economy. Science and mathematics
curricula are now being developed in schools, and students are being placed in
summer employment positions related to the project, such as environmental
monitoring and geological characterisation.<P>

No decisions on the project will be made until the Canadian government's Federal
Environmental Assessment Review Office has concluded its report on the safety
of the AECL technology involved and until the MLTC has a mandate from its people
to proceed.<P>

<H3>Relations With Local Communities: 'A Lot of Happy Faces and a Lot of Hard Work'. <A HREF="http://www.uilondon.org/uiabs95/willbio.html">Bob Williams</A>.</H3>
<P>
The nuclear sector, like the petrochemicals, motor manufacturing and pharmaceuticals industries,
 has been working hard to improve its image. Corporate communications, or public relations, plays
 a key role in this process. BNFL's major review of corporate communications, over the last two years,
 has resulted in a new corporate identity, refurbished visitor facilities, and new advertising. This new
image reflects  BNFL's shift from a UK business to a major international business. BNFL's
 support of and commitment to the community has also been demonstrated through a range of initiatives,
 four of which are discussed. 
<P>
Firstly economic regeneration: BNFL is part of the West Cumbria Partnership which encourages inward
 investment so as to diversify the employment base of the area. BNFL also supports similar organisations
 in Cheshire and Lancashire where other BNFL sites are located.
<P>
Secondly education and university links: BNFL provides resource materials to schools for many
 curriculum areas, and sponsors university posts, research and studentships, closely connecting
 the academic world with its R&D programme. 
<P>
Thirdly community involvement: the aim here is to gain acceptance from key constituencies for the
 company, in order to retain its 'licence to operate', and to 'put something back' into the community
 from which it draws its workforce ( currently some 14 000 people in the northwest of England plus
 indirectly a further 50 000 in the UK). Business philosophy advocates present management of problem
 issues, rather than their deferral to the future - therefore BNFL's corporate stance on radioactive waste
 management and environmental clean-up is mirrored by its stance on confronting unglamorous social
 issues such as  inner city decay, unemployment, drug abuse, homelessness and teenage crime. 
<P>
Fourthly sponsorship: this is defined as a business relationship between a company providing funds,
 resources or services and an individual or organisation which offers, in return, rights of association
 which can be used to the company's advantage. It is distinct from community involvement which merely
 provides funds. These activities have previously been treated separately but now a degree of synergy
 is to be promoted, with corporate sponsorship reinforcing the community involvement programme. Aims
 are to develop low-cost initiatives in the northwest, and to promote BNFL as a quality company.
<P>
Finally, branding (with the copy line 'Energetic Support in the Community') and attribution are discussed. When
 BNFL adopted its new corporate communications strategy an outside public relations company was appointed
 to handle media relations support. In the six months before the new strategy was introduced
 and attribution sought, the press coverage value was 2577.71. In the first months of the new strategy
 that value rose to 156 393.46. Other returns are more difficult to quantify but community involvement
 and sponsorship play a key part in normalising company profile and relationships with the media, and
 retaining its credibility in the community.

<H3>Uranium Mining Operation in Spain. <A HREF="http://www.uilondon.org/uiabs95/riosbio.html">Jose-Miguel Rios</A>, Javier Arnaiz, Marcial
Criado and Antonio Lopez.</H3>


The uranium division of ENUSA is responsible for uranium mining and production in Ciudad
Rodrigo, Salamanca province. Activities are based on open pit mining, heap leaching, and
dynamic leaching. The paper describes technical innovations in the field of uranium concentrates
production introduced by ENUSA in order to cut production costs, and to improve
decommissioning processes.

<P>
To cut production costs firstly the best possible information on the deposits must be obtained so
as to plan mining operations accurately. These investigations are concentrated in the  FE  area
at Ciudad Rodrigo, and concern information on grade and tonnage forecasting; distribution of
the ore; barren areas suitable for waste dumps; design of haulage roads; and characterisation of
the ore. Phases of the process which have been upgraded are ore body modelling by geostatics
and other methods; economic optimisation of open pit design, the objective being to design a pit
to yield maximum value and which will, once worked out, permit remaining lower-grade ore to
be mined if necessary; and estimation of recoverable resources under different economic
conditions.

<P>
ENUSA's innovations in mining include increasing the height of the working bench from three
to six metres; replacing semi-automatic pneumatic drilling equipment with totally automatic
hydraulic rotopercussion equipment, which cuts operating costs by 50%; increasing the diameter
of the bore holes, enabling spillable explosives to be used, which moreover are produced locally;
increasing capacity of buckets and dumpers; and automating radiometric procedures.

<P>
Total production of concentrates, from three plants, is 4149 t of U<SMALL><SUB>3</SMALL></SUB>O<SMALL><SUB>8</SMALL></SUB>. Improvements in the
minerallurgic operation are based on concentration of uranium in fine fractions of the mineral;
automated plant control; and improved safety and radiological protection. These have allowed
production to be maintained at 300t annually. Overall productivity improved from 0.7t U<SMALL><SUB>3</SMALL></SUB>O<SMALL><SUB>8</SMALL></SUB> per
man-year in 1981 to 1.6 t U<SMALL><SUB>3</SMALL></SUB>O<SMALL><SUB>8</SMALL></SUB> per man-year in 1994. There have also been staff reductions and
total quality programmes.

<P>
A description follows of the decommissioning and restoration at La Haba (Badajoz), which
comprises an open pit mine plus its waste rock disposal areas; the Lobo-G hydrometallurgical
treatment plant; depleted ore from heap leaching; and a tailings dam. Conclusions drawn from
this exercise as reference for future closure plans are: an integral closure programme for the
mine s various component parts confers significant advantage; use of the waste rock to fill the
open pits and cover the tailings dams aids site restoration; assessment of the long-term
radiological impact should be based on the natural background level of the zone; closure criteria
(e.g. of long-term stability of refuse storage systems) facilitate viability of closure by
conventional means; and restoration of the mining site allows large surface areas to be returned
to other uses.

<P>
<H3>The Cernavoda Project - Past and Future. <A HREF="http://www.uilondon.org/uiabs95/glodbio.html">Florian Glodeanu</A>, T Campureanu, T Chirica and D Popescu.</H3>


Romania and Canada agreed in 1977 to cooperate on atomic energy, and the CANDU-6 design was chosen
 as Romania's basic plant because of its proven design, operating and safety records, because the use
 of natural uranium as fuel and heavy water as coolant would permit Romania fuel cycle self-sufficiency,
 and because the process equipment would require less investment in manufacturing plant. Engineering,
 procurement and financial assistance agreements were concluded with Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd (AECL)
 and Ansaldo of Italy for the planned five-unit CANDU-6 station at Cernavoda, 150 km east of Bucharest.
 The project suffered from delays and quality problems with domestic component manufacture, and from
 inadequate project management, due to the immaturity of the nuclear industry in Romania; and also from
 disadvantages of a highly centralised economy and from political decisions.

<P>
After the revolution in 1989 an attempt was made to complete and commission Cernavoda unit 1 as soon
 as possible, and new contracts were signed between AECL and Ansaldo and the Romanian Electricity
 Authority (RENEL). Work progressed well and commercial operation for Cernavoda 1 is scheduled before
 end 1995.

<P>
Electricity demand is increasing in the recovering Romanian economy, and development studies show that
 by 2000 RENEL's available installed generating capacity should be around 21 000 MWe, from modernised
 existing fossil fuel plants and from Cernavoda 2, presently 30% complete. Use of this plant would save millions
 of tonnes of Romania's fossil fuels, and consequent pollution problems due to their high moisture, sulphur
 and ash contents. Completion of Cernavoda 2 is the second step of Romania's nuclear power programme.
 Political support is forthcoming and a financing scheme is being developed. If this is successful, Cernavoda-2
 could be completed in 55 to 58 months. Units 3, 4 and 5 are presently 14%, 5% and 4% complete respectively,
 and they will be preserved up to 2000 to await financing.

<P>
The CANDU system offers benefits which will enable Romania to be self reliant in the nuclear sector. 
Firstly, less uranium will be used than with a comparable LWR, because a CANDU uses natural uranium 
fuel (85 tU annually), and this fuel requirement is met by the Pitesti plant which manufactures 100 tonnes
of CANDU-6 fuel per year, and could manufacture more. Secondly CANDUs can use different types of fuel
 - slightly enriched uranium, recycled uranium, MOX fuel containing plutonium, and thorium fuel. Advanced 
fuel cycles are being developed. A heavy water plant has been built, and reactor components are being
 manufactured. True self-sufficiency requires a waste disposal strategy, and this is based on interim storage
 at the reactor site followed by permanent disposal.

<P>
<H3>Meeting Standards in the 21st Century. <A HREF="http://www.uilondon.org/uiabs95/coddbio.html">Grahame Codd</A> and Roger Wrayford.</H3>
The paper discusses BNFL's New Oxide Fuels Complex (NOFC). This facility at the Springfields site covers
 the whole oxide fuels manufacturing process, including conversion of UF<SMALL><SUB>6</SMALL></SUB>
 to UO<SMALL><SUB>2</SMALL></SUB>, granulation, 
pelleting, canning, and shipping of finished AGR and LWR fuel. The project was conceived in 1989,
 and was operational by 1995. Its aims were to provide a single manufacturing facility which is capable
 of producing the current 300 t/y of AGR fuel plus over 300 t/y of LWR fuel; is capable of processing
 RepU; meets and surpasses current and planned health and safety legislation by means of its own
 developed technology and working practices; and which removes process inefficiencies, improves
 flexibility and provides for future developments in the RepU market.

<P>
The plant's key concepts are to minimise operator doses, abnormal plant states, and discharges. Firstly
 the plant's physical structures to ensure this are described. Operator doses, particularly from RepU, are
 minimised by built-in shielding, including blockwork walls and thick steel flooring; by the fast tracking
 of uranium through the plant to prevent significant in-growth of U<SMALL><SUB>232</SMALL></SUB> daughters;
 and by the layout of the
 plant, which reduces spread of uranic contamination and exposure to airborne material. There is also both
 primary and secondary containment of the potentially contaminated area, and stringently controlled entry.
 Numbers of operators directly handling material are reduced by 40% compared with existing facilities and high
 degrees of automation are employed. These measures have achieved a plant contamination level of under
  4 Bq/cm<SMALL><SUP>2</SMALL></SUP> and an internal average dose over the last three months of 0.01 mSv, both well under international
 standards. Abnormal plant states are avoided through remote handling and a three level control system, and
 discharge is minimised by control of process, an important quality parameter; and by absolute filtration at source
 to prevent aerial discharges, and recovery of uranium in liquid effluent.

<P>
Secondly human factors which realise the key concepts are described. A Total Quality Management
 philosophy is implemented, and investments made in personnel development. The effectiveness of this
 strategy was demonstrated by the Sizewell order success. Quality is integrated into production activity,
 rather than using a separate quality assurance department. Training schemes ensure a flexible workforce,
 and the concept of teamworking facilitates quality management, also reducing manning levels and bringing
greater ownership and control. Management systems include manufacturing resource planning (MRP II), the
 'just-in-time' principle, and a safety conscious information technology system, with overall control maintained
 by the management information system.

<P>
BNFL's experience with NOFC has demonstrated that its ideals are being met and is confident that it can 
competitively meet 21st century standards for nuclear fuel production.

<TITLE>Comparative Health Risks of Nuclear, Fossil and Renewable Electricity

<H3>Comparative Health Risks of Nuclear, Fossil and Renewable Electricity
Generation. David Ball and Lewis Roberts.</H3><P> 

The paper describes a study undertaken to examine human health risks of large
scale electricity generating technologies available within Britain: tidal power; on
and off-shore wind; nuclear; coal; oil; and gas. A complete fuel cycle approach was
used and risks were normalised per unit of electricity produced. Risks associated
with acid rain and the greenhouse effect were not included. Risk assessment is
based largely upon statistical-actuarial data but inconsistencies regarding
definitions make comparisons and aggregation difficult, the study assesses
disagregated risks under the headings: occupational; public; fatal; non-fatal; acute;
chronic.<P>

Detailed risk tables are provided and data are examined under the further
headings of: risks from routine operation; and risks from large scale accidents. The
main risk associated with routine operation comes in the construction phase with
offshore wind showing the highest risk of 0.5 to 1 per GW year (nuclear 0.1 to 0.2).<P> 

Routine operational risks to the public are almost all of disease rather than acute
fatality and the paper stresses the difficulties of producing risk assessments on the
basis of estimates which are, in the main, hypothetical and often involve massive
speculation. Individual radiation doses to the public from the operation of a
notional PWR are far below doses from natural background radiation but
integration over long time scales or over global population produce apparently
significant figures. Total long-term exposure of the world population over 10 000
years to the radiation arising from a notional UK PWR is shown to be equivalent
to 24.9 minutes of background radiation to the world population.<P>

Considerable attention is paid to severe accident risk and the difficulty of producing
meaningful estimates of risk is stressed, not least because severe accidents are
infrequent and the figures therefore vary wildly according to the timeframe
selected.<P>

Discussion of the Chernobyl disaster concludes that, averaged over the world
population, the additional radiation exposure in the next 40 years is equivalent to
about 17 days of background radiation,  with the risk estimated at 17 delayed
fatalities per GWy over the same period.<P>

The paper concludes that the very low levels of identified risk, combined with the
difficulties of comparing risks across technologies, make the subject less worthy of
study, in the UK context, than topics such as energy security and resource
depletion.<P>

<BODY BGCOLOR="#ffffcc"><H1>1995 Uranium Institute Symposium Abstract</H1>

<P>
<H3>
The Nuclear Programme and Public Acceptance in Korea. <A HREF="http://www.uilondon.org/uiabs95/kookbio.html">Yang Chang Kook</A> and Cho Byung Oke.</H3>

<P>
Korea's total nuclear capacity in June 1995 was 8616 MWe, with 10 operating units representing 27.1% of
 Korea's total generating capacity and 35.5% of total power generation in 1994. Operating performance
 of plants has improved with  average annual 
capacity factor exceeding 80% for the last four years. Six units are under construction and seven more
 will be on line by 2006, which will give a total nuclear generation capacity of over 20 000 MWe, from
 23 plants, representing 37.7% of total generating capacity.

<P>
Korea aims at energy independence, and towards this end KEPCO is establishing a self-reliance programme 
for nuclear plant construction and operation in three phases: firstly ordering NPPs on a turnkey basis;
 secondly contracting foreign companies for NPP construction; and thirdly contracting Korean companies. 
Phase Three is now in progress with construction of  Yonggwang 3 and 4. KEPCO has also developed a 
standard NPP design ( a 1000 MWe class PWR), which was used for Ulchin units 3 and 4.

<P>
Economic and social development has brought growing environmental concern, much of it antinuclear,
 necessitating special public acceptance programmes for nuclear projects. These include KEPCO's 
 'open information' policy plus specific PA activities undertaken by each nuclear plant and enterprise;
 the law providing support for communities surrounding power plants, which KEPCO supports and finances; 
the establishment of the Organisation for Korea Atomic Energy Awareness in 1992, an independent non-profit 
organisation which carries out nuclear PA programmes through information disclosure, public education, 
support of pro-nuclear organisations, opinion surveys, and particularly through school education; and
 finally the building of exhibition centres at nuclear power stations - the one at Ulchin has already 
received two million visitors, and one is planned for Seoul which is expected to prove very influential.

<P>
Public opinion surveys, conducted regularly since 1986, reveal that though the majority of the
 population considers nuclear the main energy source for the future, they are wary because of
 fear of radiation; that people get most of their nuclear information from the mass media; that they 
distrust nuclear information from this source, preferring to believe scientists; and that chief public
 concerns are with radiation. It is therefore concluded that the best channel for nuclear PA would be
 television broadcasts by scientists on topics concerning radiation. Surveys will continue to be performed
 and PA strategy modified where necessary.

<P>
Korea plans to join the OECD in 1996 and must meet its Framework Convention on Climate Change, keeping
 greenhouse gas emissions acceptably low. Nuclear is her logical energy choice; support for this choice is in
 general high.

<BODY BGCOLOR="#ffffcc"><H1>1995 Uranium Institute Symposium Abstract</H1>

<P>

<H3>Globalisation of the Nuclear Fuel Cycle. <A HREF="http://www.uilondon.org/uiabs95/rougbio.html">Jean-Pierre Rougeau</A> and Louis-Francois Durret.</H3>




<P>
Nuclear power began in closed scientific and technical communities but rapidly became more international,
 with organisations such as IAEA and Euratom playing a role in its development. 'Globalisation' now is 
discussed in terms of three main features: firstly the increased scale and sophistication of nuclear fuel
 cycle materials and services markets. 

<P>
Commercial competition in this field has extended at the world level, the major example of such openness
 being the arrival of Russia and the CIS on the international scene. Expansion of the market has seen more
 nuclear materials being internationally transported and processed. Also, the fuel cycle is mow seen as a
 complete sophisticated system, and in a buyers' market, this optimisation of fuel cycle management results 
in significant economic advantages. This is particularly true of the utilities engaged in recycling, as front-end
 and back-end sections of the fuel cycle now constitute an intricate system to be managed globally, and
 commercial package deals for these have been offered. 

<P>
Secondly the industry has become more vulnerable  to outside pressures. In the present market-oriented
 and global environment it is no longer possible for nuclear decision-makers to operate exclusively within
 their own countries. For example, national nuclear safety rules are becoming more and more similar
 throughout the world, and a decision taken by one nuclear country can affect many others. In particular
 transportation of radioactive materials is an inherently transnational activity requiring harmonisation of
 national regulations. It is observed that news media often cause huge amplification effects in public anxiety
 about any nuclear event, even small local ones, and thus the whole industry can suffer form the failing of
 one of its members.

<P>
Thirdly, the changes described have directly affected decision-making procedures. At political level, 
the hierarchical approach has given way to more democratic processes involving external advisory committees 
and ombudsmen to deal with debating technological risk of nuclear operations. At regulatory and operational
 levels, specialised public agencies are a common technique for public management of technological risk. At
 industrial level, a similar trend towards openness is observed, with more responsive modes of decision making
 and incorporation of external information. 

<P>
Nuclear industries will survive as long as they incorporate rwo major aspects of energy policy: firstly care
 of the environment, which is now an industrial objective in its own right; and secondly public opinion - time 
must be taken to make nuclear issues familiar to the public, through accessible information and explanations, 
and reactions must be gauged and considered. COGEMA is engaged in adapting its international strategy to
 respond to public requirements.

<H3>Current Status and Future Programme of Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor Monju. <A HREF="http://www.uilondon.org/uiabs95/shibabio.html">Kiminori 
Shiba</A>.</H3>



<P>
Monju is a 280 MWe loop-type power reactor using plutonium-uranium mixed oxide fuel, with liquid sodium
 coolant, completed April 1991 and currently undergoing pre-operational testing.

<P>
R&D work is described. Development work on Monju has involved scaling up of the experimental Joyo plant,
 adding new technologies. The joint venture MOZART project between UK and Japan was performed
 to achieve appropriate core design. In the fuel development programme performance to 130 000 MWd/t
 burnup and to a neutron fluence of 2.3 &#215; 1023 neutrons cm<SMALL><SUP>-2</SMALL>
</SUP> s<SMALL><SUP>-1</SMALL></SUP> (energy > 0.1 MeV) was aimed at. Monju
 has advanced heat-transport and fuel-handling performances. Its steam generator has been especially studied,
 with additional tests ensuring no water leakage. Average fuel burnup is 80 000 Mwd/t, and the cooling system
 is of a three loop design.

<P>
JAPC constructed Monju under a contract with PNC, utilising their joint experience. Over 320 other firms
 participated in construction, which began October 1985. The location is Siraki on the Tsuruga Peninsula,
 400 km west of Tokyo.

<P>
Pre-operational tests (which are to confirm components and system performance, evaluate design margins,
 determine operational ranges of adjustable parameters in systems, and acquire test data to verify design
 methods) are in two phases: functional tests before fuel loading, and start-up tests after fuel loading. 
The former, conducted between May 1991 and December 1992, consist of assembling a dummy core, 
operation of fuel handling components and control-rod drive mechanisms in gases and sodium, pre-service
 inspection by the in-service inspection equipment, preheating of the system components and sodium charging, 
and leak rate measurements of the reactor containment vessel. These are described in detail. Start-up rests, 
begun December 1992 and scheduled to end December 1995, include tests for fuel loading and criticality, 
reactor physics, nuclear heating, and power-up. Nuclear heating tests are currently in progress.

<P>
The experimental fast reactor Joyo's function was to obtain basic FBR technology and check core 
characteristics. Monju as a prototype reactor represents the next stage of Japan's FBR development
 programme, and its role is to demonstrate performance, safety, reliability and operability of an FBR,
 plus guidelines for the economic efficiency of the demonstration reactors which will follow it. Results
 obtained from Monju's operation will be valuable to FBR technology and development, and because
 international cooperation in FBR development is important, research engineers from USA and Europe
 will be invited to make use of Monju under the 'PNC International Fellowship Programme' and other exchanges.

<H3>Prospects for power generation to 2010: the impact of growth on
 CO<SMALL><SUB>2</SMALL></SUB> emissions and the role 
of nuclear energy. <A HREF="http://www.uilondon.org/uiabs95/odelbio.html">Se&aacute;n O'Dell</A></H3>

This paper is an overview of the International Energy Agency's (IEA) World Economic 
Outlook to 2010 and is based upon the macroeconomic projections of the OECD, IMF and 
World Bank.

<P>
The IEA has assumed that satisfying demand could become problematic and has therefore 
proposed two alternatives under which demand may be reduced from what it might otherwise 
be. In the capacity constraints case (CCC) past trends are assumed to continue with the result 
that demand growth is too fast for production to keep up and prices rise dampening demand 
growth. In the energy savings case (ESC) it is assumed that imposed energy efficiency 
improvements, using currently available technology, will lead to restrained growth without 
price rises. 

<P>
Under the CCC primary energy demand is estimated to increase 44% by 2010 to about 11 500 
million toe at 2.1% pa while under the ESC the figure is 35% to a level of about 10 500 
million toe at 1.7% pa. Under both projections fuel shares are expected to remain broadly in 
line with today's figures but nuclear is expected to decline and renewables are expected to 
account for only 1% of demand. Carbon based fuels will continue to account for 90% of 
primary energy.

<P>
Electricity generation is projected to increase by 8000 TWh (CCC) or 6000 TWh (ESC). 
Under CCC fossil based generation is projected to grow faster than capacity while under ESC 
the fossil share decreases. The fuel of choice for many new projects will be gas with both 
hydro and nuclear projected to suffer a falling share worldwide though the position will vary 
from region to region. Despite a strong growth projection for renewables, a low starting point 
means that they are projected to meet only 1.2% (CCC) or 2.1% (ESC) of demand by 2010.

<P>
By 2010 global energy related CO<SMALL><SUB>2</SMALL></SUB> emissions are expected to be over 40% above 1990 levels 
under CCC and about 30% above 1990 under ESC with most of this increase occurring in the 
developing world where emissions will rise from 6 billion tonnes CO<SMALL><SUB>2</SMALL></SUB> in 1990 to 13 billion 
tonnes in 2010, 45% of the world total. The IEA projections indicate that the stabilisation of 
emissions at 1990 levels by 2010 is unlikely to be achieved in any region.

<P>
To date nuclear energy has played a significant role in limiting CO<SMALL><SUB>2</SMALL></SUB> emissions. In 1992 
emissions would have been about 11% higher without nuclear electricity. If the nuclear 
growth of the last 25 years were to continue emissions in 2010 would be about 2 billion 
tonnes less than projected by the IEA.

<H3>The Nuclear Fuel Market of the Next Century. <A HREF="http://www.uilondon.org/uiabs95/clarkbio.html">R. Gene Clark</A>.</H3>
<P>
The market in 1995 is reviewed: firstly, nuclear power programmes worldwide are stagnant
except in Asia. Secondly trade restrictions in Euratom countries and the US against imports of
uranium and SWU from former Soviet Union countries have resulted in a segmented market, with
market prices lower for those countries who accept nuclear fuel products from this region. Thirdly
the market impact of Russian HEU from dismantled weapons could be significant, and fourthly
the market effect of the NUEXCO bankruptcy must be considered.<P>

Next the market in 2005 is envisioned, after a brief comparison with 1985. Nuclear power
worldwide will either be phasing out or in resurgence, depending on its progress in both
economics and acceptance. Its share in developing countries will depend upon their ability to
finance construction. In trade regulation, US suspension agreements with Russia, Kazakhstan and
Uzbekistan will have ended, releasing former Soviet Union uranium onto the market - smoothly
in the author's opinion. HEU will have greater market impact, and will be at the level inherent in
the current contract with USEC, though who will be selling it is uncertain. By 2005 Russian-
owned natural uranium will be on the market, released at a level tied to the HEU deal. 2005 will
see  uranium production increased to approximately 1985 levels, from active projects in Canada,
Australia, US, Africa, China, Mongolia, Kazakhstan, and others; from HEU; from potential new
capacity in Australia and Canada; and from marginally competitive production sources. There will
be a healthy competitive situation, no technical shortfalls in supply, and no great extra production
capacity. Enrichment will see the beginning of new technologies, and emerging suppliers.<P>

The market in 2015 is harder to predict, being beyond the expected lifetime of most operating
plants and mines. Comparison is made with 20 years ago. By 2015 nuclear must either be on an
upsurge or well into phase-out; there can be no middle ground. The author hopes for the former
scenario but cannot predict it with certainty. Conditions necessary for a resurgence are a new
reactor technology and resolution of the waste disposal issue. The major uranium producers will be
those with reasonably assured resources in excess of 150000 tonnes U<SMALL><SUB>3</SUB>
</SMALL>O<SMALL><SUB>8</SMALL></SUB>,  Australia, Kazakhstan, Canada, South  Africa,
Uzbekistan, Russia, Brazil and Niger. Enrichment technology will have replaced gaseous diffusion
 with centrifuge, and possibly newer technologies, giving lower tails assays. The Russia-US HEU
 contract will be in its last year, but
commercial-grade nuclear fuel from warheads will still be playing a key market role.<P>

<P>


<H3>The new McClean Lake/Midwest Uranium Project. <A HREF="http://www.uilondon.org/uiabs95/poissbio.html">Michel Poissonnet</A>.</H3>



COGEMA Resources Inc. and its partners are developing the McClean Lake Project, located in
northern Saskatchewan in the eastern Athabasca Sandstone Basin, 750 km north of Saskatoon.
It comprises five uranium deposits: JEB to the north, Sue A, Sue B and Sue C in the south, and
McClean to the west. The mineral leases contain around 20 000tU (50 million pounds equivalent
U<SMALL><SUB>3</SUB></SMALL>O<SUB><SMALL>8</SUB></SMALL>). The project history and ownership are outlined, plus the connection with the Midwest
Project, whose deposit lies 15 km west of McClean and contains around 360 000 tonnes of 3.8%
uranium ore, (13 700 tU or 35 million pounds equivalent U<SMALL><SUB>3</SMALL></SUB>O<SMALL><SUB>8</SMALL></SUB>). COGEMA is regarded as the
operator of both projects.  

<P>
The environmental review processes for the projects are under way; the Midwest Project is not
yet approved but approval is expected in early 1997. Construction and production activities will
start at the JEB deposit and include the main access road; waste and ore storage pads and water
containment ponds; the water treatment plant with water and sludge ponds; the office and
maintenance shop; electrical sub-station and distribution network; and the groundwater
interceptor wells ringing the JEB pit. Stripping of the overburden will follow, then waste rock
mining, and ultimately ore mining by end 1996. Construction of the processing plant will
proceed simultaneously. The mined out JEB pit will become a tailings depository in 1997, and
mining activity will move to Sue C (1998-2002); Sue A and B (2003-2005); Midwest (2003-
2009); and the McClean underground mine (from 2009).

<P>
Innovative technical features which make McClean and Midwest Projects a technological
showcase for COGEMA are the jet boring mining method at Midwest, which breaks up
previously frozen ore with a high pressure water jet; the design of the McClean mill, which is
based on conceptual risk analysis and also on use of two-storey buildings, the personnel on the
second floor being separated from the ore on the first floor by a thick concrete floor; and the JEB
pit and tailings management facility, which uses a ring of 30 dewatering wells to intercept and
remove groundwater before mining - this reduces chemical loading to the environment and
creates drier mining conditions.

<P>
COGEMA's commitment to local people is demonstrated by its continuing to fill almost 60% of
permanent positions at Cluff Lake mine with residents of Saskatchewan s North. A similar
committment has been applied to the new mines and a  Multi-Party Training Agreement , signed
and funded by industry and governments, anticipates employee requirements for the future while
many contracts for construction activities and services have been awarded to local businesses.
COGEMA's Human Resources Agreement with the Prince Albert Development Corporation,
the business arm of the Prince Albert Tribal Council, facilitates hiring of northerners to
McClean.

<P>

<H3>Is There a Tomorrow for Nuclear Power Generation? <A HREF="http://www.uilondon.org/uiabs95/kanohbio.html">Tokio Kanoh</A>.</H3>


<P>
Despite negative press reports,  nuclear power generation continues to expand. At end 1994, 425 nuclear reactors were operating in 30 countries, combined capacity being 356 GWe. Since the 
Chernobyl accident, nuclear power generation capacity has increased by 79 GWe net (1986-1994). Much
 of the expansion is in Asia. Energy options adopted in different areas are of three patterns: hydro-rich 
countries; coal-rich countries; and resource-poor countries. Some of the latter use nuclear either as their
 main power source, or as diversification. The trend from NIMBY to PIMBY ('please in my back yard') is
 illustrated with examples from Japan and the Marshall Islands.

<P>
In a Japanese public opinion survey in 1990 on both the safety and  the future of nuclear it was
 revealed that strong opinions at the end of the spectrum account for only 10%. Therefore 90% of the
 population maintain a flexible stance, and it is with  them that positive and negative aspects of nuclear
 should be discussed. Positive aspects are that nuclear is a technology-intensive energy source with minimal
 fuel requirement, facilitating energy security; it is an alternative to oil; and it is compatible with the environment,
 being cleaner even than photovoltaic. Negative aspects are concern about possible accidents; problems with
 radioactive waste; and concern about weapons proliferation.

<P>
Scenarios for the 21st century are presented. Likely prospects up to 2050 are population increase,
 mainly in developing countries; increased energy demand; and international disputes over fossil fuel 
resources. It is predicted that China, at some point in the 21st century, will be consuming three times
 more oil than the US at present. Energy efficiency must therefore be improved, and all fuel resources
 developed. Peter Beck's three scenarios for nuclear in the 21st century are presented: first that there
 will be no new nuclear plants and existing ones phased out; second that nuclear capacity will increase
 from the present 360 million kW to 400 million kW but after 2000 capacity will level off at this figure; third
 that nuclear power development will progress and capacity reach 1.5 billion kW by 2050. We should not wait,
 the author says, to see which one will happen, but choose a scenario and work out strategies to make it happen.

<P>
Finally seven proposals are made for conduct to win public support for nuclear development: firstly nuclear
 power is not a pre-condition, but there should be 'dematerialisation' from a wasteful lifestyle to a recycle-oriented
 society, 'decoupling' to separate increased energy use from economic growth, by energy conservation;
 and 'decarbonisation' or development of non- carbon energy; secondly risk communication based on
 accurate information; thirdly on-going dialogues with opponents of nuclear; fourthly a track record of
 safe and stable nuclear operation; fifthly the 'visibility' i.e., openness of both nuclear facilities and 
nuclear information; sixthly the building of a framework for regional cooperation, especially in Asia; and
 finally the provision of accurate information to the mass media.

<H3>The Prospects for Nuclear Power. <A HREF="http://www.uilondon.org/uiabs95/hawlbio.html">Robert Hawley</A>.</H3>
<P>
The perception of nuclear power's prospects in 1975 is reviewed: world reliance on oil, gas and
coal was decreasing due to market volatility and countries were turning to nuclear as having stable
and competitive prices and technological maturity. Between 1975 and 1992, total electricity
generated worldwide on an annual basis increased by 84%, the proportion generated by nuclear
by almost 500%. <P>

At present nuclear supplies around 7% of world primary energy by meeting around 17% of world
electricity demand. In 1994 432 nuclear reactors were operating in 32 countries, generating over
2100 TWh of electricity. Nuclear provides over half the electricity demand of Sweden, Belgium,
France and Lithuania, and over one third of that of the European Union. Rapid growth in nuclear
capacity now centres not in the West but in the Pacific Rim countries. Seventy-six plants operate
in this area, with 21 more under construction, six planned and 35 proposed. When these are
finished the area will have more nuclear plants than the USA.<P>

Environmental issues such as global warming, acid rain and the ozone layer holes are likely to
influence energy decisions for the future. However, forecast population increases in the
developing world in the next few decades will bring rapidly increasing energy demand, which will
probably be met by burning fossil fuels, leading to increased CO<SMALL><SUB>2</SMALL></SUB> emissions.
 The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicts that without controls on greenhouse gas
emissions, global mean temperatures will increase by 0.3&#186;C per decade over the next
century, raising sea levels by 20 - 65 cm. The IEA's World Energy Outlook predicts that world
demand for primary energy will grow by 50% from 1991 to 2010, driven by world GDP growth
of 70%; that primary energy demand outside OECD will more than double by 2010; that fossil
fuels will continue the predominant energy sources; that world carbon emissions will rise by 50%
by 2010: and that any international initiative to reduce CO<SMALL><SUB>2</SMALL></SUB> emissions
 that is not adopted by non-OECD countries will have little impact.<P>

Nuclear, to play its part in reducing CO<SMALL><SUB>2</SMALL></SUB> emissions, must overcome
 adverse public perceptions
associated with waste management, decommissioning plant, and safety standards. It must
demonstrate its favourable track record for safety compared with other sections of the energy
industry, and convince the public of nuclear's environmental benefits and cost-effectiveness.
International development and collaboration must continue, allowing nuclear to be brought to less
developed countries. Environmental concerns offer good prospects for the future of nuclear
provided that the industry continues its efforts to demonstrate its desirablilty to the public.<P>

<TITLE>Worldwide Improvements in Nuclear Power Operational Safety - Andrew Clarke (WANO)</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR="#ffffcc"><H1>1994 Uranium Institute Symposium Abstract</H1>
<IMG SRC="http://www.uilondon.org/bluline.gif" WIDTH=100%>


<H3>Worldwide Improvements in Nuclear Power Operational Safety. Andrew
Clarke.</H3>
<P> 


The paper reviews the progress made by nuclear operating countries worldwide
since 1979 towards improving safety and reliability of their power plants, and
discusses the question of accidence avoidance.<P>

Operating standards are set down by the IAEA's International Nuclear Safety
Advisory Group. Safe operation results from an interdependent combination of
quality in design, manufacture and construction, and quality of  operation. The
evolution of design, construction and safety criteria is described; remedial measures
taken on older-design reactors are referred to. Concerning the operator's role, the
evolution of cooperation is outlined: the TMI accident precipitated the formation in
the US of the Institute of Nuclear Power Operators, to provide for sharing
experience. Similarly the Chernobyl accident convinced nuclear operators
worldwide of their total dependence on one another and led to the formation of the
World Association of Nuclear Operators.<P>

WANO's structure and function (to maximise safety and reliability of nuclear plants
by exchanging information and encouraging communication, comparison and
emulation amongst its members) are described, and its Peer Review programme
tabulated. Improvement in safety, however, is difficult to measure.<P>

In the US dramatic improvements in safety have been made, partly through INPO:
precursor analysis shows US nuclear power plants to be 50 to 100 times less likely
to suffer major core damage than they were in 1979; fewer less important events are
occurring too; and collective radiation exposure has been halved since 1979.<P>

In terms of general experience, evidence of improvement comes from WANO and
from many other sources including IAEA safety missions.<P>

Soviet-designed reactors (VVER440/230 and RBMKs) are mistrusted by the West,
although informed commentators consider immediate closure unnecessary. Whether
or not to operate a reactor is for national governments (under appropriate advice)
to judge, not for WANO. Soviet-designed reactors are classified in a table in three
design generations, and further tables list design improvements made to them.
Political and economic difficulties in Russia and Ukraine have hindered progress
somewhat.<P>

Operators must avoid complacency and continue to work for improvement.<P>

<P>
<H3>Corporate Citizenship and the Saskatchewan Uranium Industry. <A HREF="http://www.uilondon.org/uiabs95/michbio.html">Bernard M. Michel</A>.</H3>




<P>
The uranium mines of Saskatchewan, which contributed almost 30% to total world production in 1994, are
 an interesting laboratory for the study of corporate community relations, for five reasons: firstly there are
 only two operators, Cameco Corporation and COGEMA Resources Inc., to be considered; secondly, because
 of the boards of enquiry to review the Cluff Lake and Key Lake projects in the late 1970s and early 1980s
 there exist over 15 years worth of information on the public views of the industry; thirdly there exist records
 of continuous government monitoring of the industry; fourthly, Saskatchewan hosts two extraordinary uranium
 projects, the Cigar Lake and McArthur River projects; and finally, its 600 000 square kilometres are home to
 only one million inhabitants who comprise two distinct categories: the 35 000 northern residents, mostly of
 native ancestry, and the majority of the population who live in the south.

<P>
The community relations programme's first action was to listen, through public hearings, to the communities'
 expressed concerns, which focused in the north upon radioactivity fears, employment and training
 opportunities and business development, and in the south upon environmental and health risks, proliferation,
 economic development and employment.

<P>
The response for the north consisted of offering jobs: about 50% of the employees of Saskatchewan's 
three uranium mines are northerners; offering training opportunities: these include school education on
 uranium mining, work orientation, and career development; business development: through purchasing
 power and preferential treatment, an example being Cameco's agreement with the trucking company NRT
 for an exclusive contract in return for NRT's increased training and employment of northeners; and a 
northern community liaison committee, to discuss issues of common interest such as water quality. 

<P>
Southern programmes are more conventional, supporting the local community through donations, sponsorship
 and employment schemes. Uranium Saskatchewan, the trade association, delivers public information 
programmes at all levels, particularly to schools. The governments also play  a role in maintaining public 
confidence in safety standards.

<P>
Today 80% of Saskatchewan's residents, compared with 65% in 1990, support continued uranium mining.
 This reflects the industry's community relations initiatives. Cameco's shares also trade at 3.5 times their 
1991 issue price. Only a small segment of anti-nuclear activists takes a negative  view. Relationships 
with local communities, like uranium ore, are a valuable resource needing competent development.

<P>
Prof Viktor Mikhailov
graduated from the Moscow Engineering and Physical Institute in 1958 as a specialist on theoretical nuclear physics. He joined the All-Union (now All-Russia) Research Institute of Experimental Physics in Arzamas-16, the country's oldest and largest nuclear centre. There he did research on the development of nuclear explosion processes and on techniques of measuring fast impulse reactions of fission and fusion in these processes. He worked at the Moscow Research Institute of Impulse Technology from 1969, and became its head in 1988. In 1988 he led on the Soviet side a Soviet-US experiment on controlling the capacity of nuclear tests at the Nevada and Semipalatinsk test sites. In the same year he was appointed Deputy Minister for Nuclear Power Development and Industry and entrusted with heading the country's nuclear weapons complex. He has held his present post of Russian Federation Minister for Nuclear Power since March 1992. In July 1995 he also became a member of the Security Council of the Russian Federation. He has a doctorate in technology and holds a professorial chair at the Moscow Engineering and Physical Institute. He is Vice President of the International Information Academy and scientific head of the All-Russia Research Institute of Experimental Physics in Kremlev. He won the Lenin Prize in 1967 and the State Prize in 1982. His hobby is chess.

 and Arnaud de Bourayne.</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY BGCOLOR="#ffffcc"><H1>1995 Uranium Institute Symposium Abstract</H1>

<P>
<H3>The Enrichment Market - Present Outlines and Prospects. <A HREF="http://www.uilondon.org/uiabs95/giletbio.html">Beatrice Gillet</A> and Arnaud de Bourayne.
</H3>
The enrichment market appears to be becoming more global, firstly because of the intermingling of
 previously discrete fuel cycle products and services, notably the market entry of diluted HEU and
 plutonium from nuclear weapons; secondly because market participants are developing new connections
 - producers with producers, producers with utilities, and utilities with utilities; and thirdly because power
 supply market deregulation is influencing utilities' procurement patterns.

<P>
The changes are considered firstly from the suppliers' side. Firstly in the US, main issues at present are
 the HEU deal between the US and Russia, the Suspension Agreements between US and Russia, the
 privatisation of USEC, and US HEU being transferred to USEC, all theses issues being interconnected.
 Difficulties with these arrangements are that USEC is at the same time being asked to make a deal with
 its chief competitor, and to be business-oriented and enhance its value with a view to privatisation; and
 that the Russians have had difficulty in negotiating an acceptable deal. Secondly in Russia, there is supply
 overcapacity and uncertainty about trends in domestic needs, while Russian pricing policy has prompted
 protectionism in the US and EU. There are new developments, however, in both these relationships.
 Thirdly in the EU, Urenco needs to make sales beyond 2000, short term production capacity being sold
 out, but as yet has not been able to make the investment in the new production capacity, long term
 commitments being hard to obtain. Eurodif meanwhile is benefitting from France's favourable nuclear climate.

<P>
Secondly from the utilities' perspective, deregulation is the major trend. In US the 'Exempt Wholesale Generator'
 scheme put utilities and independent generators on equal terms. In Europe deregulation is newer and
 complicated by the variety of different systems, plus uncertainty over such issues as whether a member
 state should grant a production licence to a chosen supplier for a new power plant, or whether a call for
 bids should be issued to European partners; who should have access to the distribution network; and who
 should be in charge of power transmission. A compromise based on the 'single buyer scheme' seems likely
 to emerge, and though many issues await solution, many links already exist between European producers.

<P>
Another concern of utilities is the future of nuclear in light of some government policies. In Germany,
 utilities are unable to make plans for their reactors for longer than five years ahead, due to the insecurity
 of their operating licences in an anti-nuclear environment. Within the anti-nuclear opposition party, the
 SDP, however, there have been calls for a 'reassessment of nuclear energy'. Acceptance in Sweden
 is improving, but in other areas is problematic. Only Asia is in favour of expanding nuclear capacity.

<P>
The changes have eliminated artificial differences in the price of enrichment services, and a more balanced
 procurement programme is emerging, Their aims are now to minimise risks through procurement diversification,
 purchase from primary producers not traders, and find flexible, reliable suppliers.

<P>

<P>

<H3>Selection of a Management Strategy for Depleted Uranium.
 <A HREF="http://www.uilondon.org/uiabs95/patonbio.html">Scott Patton</A>, Edward Hanrahan and Charles Bradley Jr.</H3>



<P>
Depleted uranium hexafluoride (UF<SMALL><SUB>6</SUB></SMALL>), resulting from the uranium
 enrichment process, currently amounts to <NOBR>560 000</NOBR> tonnes in the US, and is stored in 47 000 large steel 
cylinders, regularly inspected and maintained at Paducah, Portsmouth and Oak Ridge. In 2020 the cylinders
will begin to reach the end of their normal lives and the material will either be converted
 to U<SMALL><SUB>3</SMALL></SUB>O<SMALL><SUB>8</SMALL></SUB> or
 disposed of. Due to changes in the nature of the DOE's mission and functions, alterations in presidential 
budget requests, and changes occasioned by the end of the Cold War, the DOE must now reassess its
 management plan for depleted UF<SMALL><SUB>6</SUB></SMALL>, and has therefore initiated the 
Depleted Uranium Hexafluoride
 Management Programme to consider alternative strategies (use/reuse, conversion, storage or disposal)
 for its cost-effective and environmentally safe long-term management.

<P>
The first phase of the programme, begun November 1994, was selection of a management strategy.
 This phase encompasses technology and engineering assessment, environmental impact assessment,
 and life-cycle cost analysis of alternative management strategies, and will provide opportunities for public
 participation. Phase Two will be implementation of the chosen strategy.

<P>
Technical findings to date are briefly described under the headings conversion, storage, recycle/reuse and
disposal. A key feature of most suggested options is conversion to oxide or metal form at some stage. Preliminary
 management strategies, as identified by DOE
 at the beginning of the Programme, are continuation of current  strategy and management practices; modification 
of current storage facilities and procedures; use of depleted UF<SMALL><SUB>6</SUB></SMALL> (converting
 UF<SMALL><SUB>6</SUB></SMALL> for uses such as radiation shielding); and disposal.

<P>
Selection of a strategy is affected by various issues, firstly technical maturity: a long and expensive R&D
 programme, or one with a low probability of success, might be unacceptable, as might evolving technologies
 if near-term actions are required, or certain technologies, such as the fast breeder reactor, about which the
 public are sensitive; secondly environmental, health and safety issues: a cradle-to-grave assessment is
 required; thirdly economic implications: lost opportunity costs must be considered, for example irretrievable 
disposal precludes use of depleted uranium for radiation shielding, and so full life-cycle cost of the managment
 strategies will be evaluated; fourthly public involvement: this is essential for the siting of facilities, and plays
 an essential part in preparing an Environmental Impact Assessment; fifthly socioeconomic factors: new
 facilities impact upon their localities in terns of increased population, increased transport needs, change
 in local character, and investments in infrastructure etc., and desirable effects must be maximised and
 undesirable ones minimised by any strategy; and finally public and private sector roles: public and private 
sectors should work together in achieving an efficient and effective programme. Two additional issues that
 have recently been identified are current trends for reducing government spending; and the effects on the 
domestic and international uranium industry.

<TITLE>The UK Nuclear Review: a Perspective by Nuclear Electric - John Coffey and
Graham Oates (Nuclear Electric)</TITLE>

<H3>The UK Nuclear Review: a Perspective by Nuclear Electric. John Coffey and
Graham Oates.</H3>
<P>


In 1989 the UK government withdrew nuclear from the electricity privatisation
programme, seeing it as too great an investment risk, and created Nuclear Electric
plc and Scottish Nuclear Ltd as publicly owned companies to own and operate
nuclear power stations. A moratorium on new nuclear stations was instituted, not
including Sizewell B.<P>

Since 1989 privatisation of the rest of the UK electricity supply industry has
continued, subjecting nuclear to a competitive market. Continued operation of
Magnox and AGR stations was accepted as economically justified; Nuclear Electric's
performance improved with output up by 43% by 1989, market share up from 16.7%
to 23.2% and unit cost down to 2.6p/kWh for AGR. Sizewell B was built to schedule
and budget; progress was made, through negotiations with BNFL and UK Nirex
Ltd, regarding spent fuel management and waste disposal. The Fossil Fuel Levy
was instituted and distributed to non-fossil electricity generators, and is used by
Nuclear Electric to meet its inherited liabilities.<P>

The Nuclear Review is seen as deciding the future of nuclear electricity generation
in the UK. The Review, conducted by the DTI, will examine commercial viability of
new nuclear power stations and whether they offer diversity, security of supply and
environmental benefits; options for private sector finance; how best to manage
waste disposal and decommissioning; and levy arrangements. The nuclear
generators have already published their case.<P>

Nuclear Electric's priority is for privatisation, so that it can have full commercial
freedom without government intervention, and can raise private finance (public
funds not being available) to invest in assets to replace Magnox stations, which are
not regarded as fully privatisable. Privatisation's advantages include possible cost
savings on contracts with BNFL, gaining better value for the taxpayer and
consumer.<P>

Nuclear Electric also favours construction of new nuclear plant. Commercial risks
are thought least for a new station based on the Sizewell design (a twin PWR
'Sizewell C', cost 3.5 billion). A paradox in UK energy policy is pointed out, in that
the government looks to market forces to bring about its energy policy aims of
secure, diverse supplies of affordable electricity, but does not recognise nuclear's
environmental and diversity benefits overtly in the price structure of the electricity
market.<P>

Nuclear Electric believes that both its aims and those of the government can be met
given the political will.<P>

plc, with special responsibilities for the Company's contribution to the
Government's Nuclear Review; Dr. Oates is Director of Strategic Planning for
Nuclear Electric plc.)

<TITLE>Near-Term Plutonium Disposition and Nuclear Power Generation: The
Dual Purpose Concept - William G. Counsil (Washington Public Power Supply System)</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR="#ffffcc"><H1>1994 Uranium Institute Symposium Abstract</H1>
<IMG SRC="http://www.uilondon.org/bluline.gif" WIDTH=100%>


<H3>Near-Term Plutonium Disposition and Nuclear Power Generation: The
Dual Purpose Concept. William G. Counsil.</H3>
<P>



The Washington Public Power Supply System (WPPSS) generates electricity for the
Pacific Northwest region, and operates the 1120 MWe nuclear plant WNP2 on the
USDOE's Hanford Reservation, Washington State, plus two partially completed
nuclear plants. WPPSS is the only organisation with power reactors licensed by the
US Nuclear Regulatory Commission to entertain the use weapons plutonium in
commercial reactors.<P>

The WPPSS proposal is to burn surplus weapons plutonium as MOX in the Hanford
reactors thereby disposing of it and simultaneously generating commercial
electricity. The USDOE would provide for processing of the plutonium into MOX
(probably on the Hanford Reservation), which would undergo a once-through fuel
cycle, spent MOX fuel being returned to USDOE for storage and disposal. USDOE
would support conversion of WNP1 and 2 to MOX burners and pay operation and
maintenance costs, and the Supply System would continue to own and operate
them, licensed by the NRC. Revenues from the sale of power would serve as a credit
against the government's costs.<P>

Advantages of the concept are enhanced safety and efficiency, through centralised
operations on one site; proven technology; cost effectiveness, with an existing
infrastructure; promptness of disposition as compared with other methods;
environmental soundness; and potential impetus for any international cooperative
effort. The concept is consistent with US non-proliferation policy and actually
decreases the amount of separated plutonium and hence the risk of diversion.<P>

Other advantages include generation of reliable and competitively priced electricity;
diversification of regional electricity generating sources; job creation; and
environmental preservation (reducing reliance on hydro and adding generating
capacity without either the need for new facilities or increased greenhouse gases).<P>

The other recommended disposition option, vitrification, compares unfavourably
with the WPPSS proposal. It is not proven technology, it fails to meet the spent fuel
standard and it does not offset the cost of disposition by electricity generation.<P>

The National Academy of Sciences has concluded that the use of MOX in
commercial reactors is one of the most viable options for plutonium disposition. The
WPPSS proposal is very much in line with emerging US policy on plutonium
disposition, which is looking for a speedy solution to the problem of surplus in the
interests of global arms reduction and non-proliferation. The Supply System looks
forward to playing a key role in US policy in this area.<P>

<P>

<H3>USEC's Transition to a Commercial Enterprise. <A HREF="http://www.uilondon.org/uiabs95/rifbio.html">George P. Rifakes</A>.</H3>



The paper discusses the beneficial process of change, its effect on the industry, and the role of
USEC in the process.

<P>
The changing situations of prices, supply and demand, and outlook for the industry through the
1970s and 1980s are briefly described, ending with the emergence of Russia as a major supplier
and the development of strong competition in the enrichment market. These circumstances
threatened US dominance in the enrichment market and prompted Congress to create USEC,
whose tasks were to take over the US enrichment enterprise from the DOE, to fix it and run it
as a business. These aims have been accomplished and the business now has over US$1 billion
in revenues. 

<P>
USEC's priority is to meet customer needs and it has the flexibility to explore better ways of
doing this. For instance a USEC customer may purchase a product rather than the uranium; also,
contracts can be tailored to individual customers and prices individually negotiated.

<P>
New efficiencies include increased production capability, increased availability and reliability
of plants, a 10% increase in the amount of process equipment on stream, and more efficient
power utilisation.

<P>
Future plans encompass use of AVLIS, which offers relatively low capital costs, reduced
operating costs (10% of the power used by gaseous diffusion plants), an efficient modular design
which can be introduced incrementally, and reduced feed compared with other methods.

<P>
Further factors that will bring about change are the conversion of weapons stockpiles to reactor
fuel, and the privatisation of USEC, expected early 1996. To help ensure USEC's viability,
certain legislative changes are required and expected, and certification with the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission has been reapplied for. Certification should take place early 1996.

<P>
USEC intends to take an active rather than a passive role in change, and to supply a consistent
and persuasive voice from the US in support of nuclear power.

<TITLE>The Nuclear Safety Account: Achievements and Projects After One Year of
Activity - Francois Demarcq (EBRD)</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR="#ffffcc"><H1>1994 Uranium Institute Symposium Abstract</H1>
<IMG SRC="http://www.uilondon.org/bluline.gif" WIDTH=100%>


<H3>The Nuclear Safety Account: Achievements and Projects After One Year of
Activity. Francois Demarcq.</H3>
<P> 


The Nuclear Safety Account (NSA) was established in 1993 by request of the G-7
countries, to address immediate operational safety and technical safety
improvement measures for Soviet-designed reactors in central and eastern Europe
and the former Soviet Union. The European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (EBRD) acts as the NSA Secretariat and provides technical, financial,
legal and administrative services. Funding is by voluntary contribution from EBRD
members and other countries, and so far totals ECU 135 million (US$165 million).
Priority is given to reactors presenting the highest level of risk, that can be
significantly reduced by short-term and cost-effective safety measures, and which
are necessary to ensure a region's continuing electricity supply.<P>

Under the Soviet system, nuclear plant operation was geared towards achieving
maximum output; safety considerations came second. The design deficiencies of
VVER and RBMK reactors are listed. Promotion of a 'safety culture' is advocated,
and desired improvements detailed, both operational (training of plant personnel,
good maintenance procedures, fire protection measures, pressure boundary
inspection and component testing, quality assurance programmes) and technical
(fire detection and fighting equipment, emergency diesel generators, emergency core
cooling system improvements, new reactor trip automatic systems, control room
aids, segregation of safety-related equipment). Experts estimate costs of short-term
safety improvements to RBMKs and VVERs at US$700 million to US$1 billion.<P>

The NSA's project at the Kozloduy VVER-440/230s plant in Bulgaria, cost ECU 24
million (US$30 million), is currently being implemented, and the ECU 33 million
(US$40 million) for Lithuania's Ignalina plant with 2 RBMKs, has been approved.
Two further projects, for the Leningrad plant's four RBMKs (ECU 30 million
(US$36 million)) and the Novovoronezh and Kola plants with four VVER-440/230
reactors (ECU 45 million (US$55 million)) are being negotiated. Further
developments in Russia are expected and also in the Ukraine, where the focus is on
a quick shutdown of Chernobyl in the context of a comprehensive energy
strategy,including completion of three VVER-1000s.<P>

The EBRD's energy operations policy has recently been updated, spelling out more
explicitly the principles underlying its nuclear safety activities.<P>

A loan is being considered for completion and safety upgrading of two VVER-
440/213 units at Mochovce in Slovakia. Further projects however appear doubtful,
especially in the Ukraine due to its particular economic difficulties.<P>

The Russian nuclear establishment tends to interpret the western attitude as
antagonistic to the Russian nuclear system. This attitude must somehow be
overcome if nuclear safety risks are to be reduced and longterm cooperation and in-
depth exchange of knowledge and expertise is to be instituted. The EBRD hopes to
help establish this mutual confidence.<P>

<BODY BGCOLOR="#ffffcc"><H1>1995 Uranium Institute Symposium Abstract</H1>

<P>

<H3>The Enrichment Industry in the Russian Federation. <A HREF="http://www.uilondon.org/uiabs95/mikbio.html">Viktor Mikhailov</A>.
</H3>


Firstly the antecedents of the present Russian Ministry for Atomic energy (Minatom) are
outlined: in August 1945 a special committee on atomic energy was established by the Soviet
government, followed by the first main government department. In 1946 the first controlled
nuclear chain reaction in Russia was achieved at the Kurchatov Institute, following Fermi's in
Chicago. In 1948 the first industrial scale reactor in Russia, for plutonium production, started up
at Mayak, together with the first radiochemical facility for extraction of weapons grade
plutonium. In 1952 Russia's first isotope separation facility was commissioned, and in 1954 her
first nuclear reactor for peaceful purposes began operation.

<P>
Minatom was established in January 1992; 80% of its capacities are in Russia, the remainder in
Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Belarus. Minatom employs one million workers in its
R&amp;D and industrial facilities. Only 14% of its programme is associated with defence; other
portions of the Ministry deal with the nuclear industry (design, development, commissioning and
decommissioning of nuclear power stations, including the whole fuel cycle from uranium mining
to reprocessing and disposal); applied sciences; mechanical construction and tool production;
and the construction and assembly industry. 

<P>
Civil production within the Ministry has increased by 1 or 2% annually, and exports have
doubled since 1992. A new VVER-1000 unit at Balakovo nuclear power station has also been
commissioned. Russia now has nine power stations operating 29 nuclear reactors, with 22
gigawatts of electrical capacity; this represents 30% of the total electricity generated in European
Russia, though only 12% of total electricity generated in Russia including Siberia. Minatom plan
before 2005 to increase total capacity to 28 or 30 gigawatts. Attention is also being given to
nuclear development abroad, in China, India, Iran, Brazil, and possibly Indonesia.

<P>
Russia has four uranium enrichment facilities, in Ekaterinburg, Tomsk, Krasnoyarsk and
Angarsk, total enrichment capacity 20 million SWU annually. Development of isotope separation
has gone through the stages of gaseous dynamic nozzle technology, gaseous diffusion, and
centrifugal isotope separation, now in its fifth generation. Centrifuges are efficient and reliable,
average frequency of rotation 1000-2000 rotations per second. The next stage, laser technology,
is not seen by the author as being competitive for heavy atoms like uranium.

<P>
Russia is only using 50% of her enrichment capacity, for domestic and export production, and
is therefore open to foreign markets for her high technology centrifuge separation. The author
looks forward to the increasing use of nuclear power in the next century.

<P>

<H3>Fuel Design Trends in Indian PHWRs. S A Bhardwaj, A G Chhatre and M Ravi.</H3>
<P>


India's long-term nuclear strategy involves the optimal usage of domestic uranium and thorium
resources. The reactor technology developed for the first stage of the programme is the
pressurised heavy water reactor (PHWR) which has evolved from an initial collaboration with
Atomic Energy of Canada Limited (AECL) at the Rajasthan power plant. Second stage
technology will use plutonium arising from the first stage in fast breeder reactors (FBRs). The
conversion of thorium to U-233 will be taken up in these FBRs, for use in subsequent FBRs or
in advanced fuel cycles in PHWRs.<P>

The Indian PHWRs are 220/235 MWe units employing on-load fuelling. Seven units are in
operation and five are under construction or commissioning. Designs for a 500 MWe PHWR and
a 500 MWe FBR have also been completed.<P>

Initial fuel for the PHWR was the 19 element Canadian design first used in the Rajasthan plant
in 1971. Since then the fuel has been developed and performance has steadily improved.
Developments have in some cases been prompted by Canadian experience, eg the use of graphite
coating to overcome the problem of fuel failure induced by power ramps, while in other cases
India has developed its own technical solutions to problems.<P>

Power flattening in PHWR first cores has been achieved by use of depleted uranium bundles.
Fabricating these bundles interrupted the mass production of the natural uranium fuel so the use
of thorium bundles for power flattening was developed. 35 thorium bundles have now been loaded
into Kakrapar-1 and a similar pattern is being adopted for all new PHWRs.<P>

A first step towards advanced fuel cycles will be the introduction of MOX fuel in the 19 element
bundle.  MOX-7 fuel has been designed to cope with the problems of online refuelling with MOX.
With this fuel discharge burnup would increase from 6700 MWd/tU to 10 300 MWd/tU with a
corresponding decrease in the refuelling requirement. Investigation has led to the conclusion that
19 element fuel bundle is not ideal for extended burnup or MOX and a 22 element bundle is being
designed for this situation. This new design will also allow a 15% power uprating of the core.
Two channel loads of this fuel have now been successfully test irradiated at the Madras power
plant. In addition a 37 element fuel bundle has been designed for the 500 MWe PHWR.<P>

O.T. Studios, originally known as Outreach Tapes, was founded by John Schweikert as a family business in 1975.  John began by duplicating message tapes for churches, adding equipment and facilities as the business grew.  His desire was to spread the Word of God through the ministry of cassette tapes.  The business rapidly expanded to include both <A HREF="#Studio Services">audio and video duplication</A>, and soon grew to include <A HREF="#Convention Services">seminar and conference services</A>, and CD replication as well.  <BR><BR>The growing demands brought other family members and "extended" family members to the ranks, each with the same commitment to the Lord and to the ministry of O.T. Studios.  Today, the company employs over 20 men and women, all considered to be part of "the O.T. Family."

    FOCUS</b></font></p>
    <p><b>LEADERSHIP IN TECHNOLOGY</b> </p>
    <p>Rapid progress is being made in electronic components
    technologies, with attention focused on the submicron level.
    As a customer needs diversify, Sankyo's new production
    technologies, based on fine mechanical technology and
    flexible, manufacturing systems (FMS), enable the Company to
    maintain its position as a market leader.</p>
    <p>Major areas of concentration include office automation,
    audiovisual related products, home automation and home
    appliances and factory automation. Particular emphasis is
    placed on meeting customer specifications regarding quality,
    price and delivery date. </p>
    <p>The Company is a world-leading manufacturer of musical
    movements, direct-drive spindle motors for floppy-disk
    drives, stepping motors used in floppy-disk drives, VCR
    capstan motors, magnetic card readers used in bank systems,
    AC inductor motors for home appliances, defrost controllers
    for refrigerators, optical pick-up units for CD-ROMs and
    magnetic heads for audio products.</p>
    <p>Sankyo is continuing to develop applied technology for
    magnetic materials, function-polymer technology, optical
    devices and semiconductor devices. Sankyo has the technology
    to develop and process component materials. For example,
    utilizing vacuum evaporation technology we developed the
    magnetic resistance element used in the rotary encoder as a
    thin-membrane magnetic sensor. </p>
    <p>Sankyo also develops and markets such materials as
    rare-earth polymer magnetics, used in motors; electronic
    displays, through the application of function-polymer
    technology; and ceraphalloy bearings, manufactured from
    revolutionary bearing materials. By developing its own
    materials, Sankyo is able to respond quickly to customer
    needs. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><b>FLEXIBLE PRODUCTION</b> </p>
    <p>Sankyo constantly raises the level of its production
    technology and the quality of its products. The key concept
    behind Sankyo's production technology is the Built-Block
    System (BBS). A production line is usually made up of blocks
    tailored to production of specific goods and of blocks that
    cover widely used, fundamental movements. Sankyo's BBS adds
    versatility and flexibility to these important blocks,
    significantly delaying obsolescence. Our systems can easily
    switch from small-to mass-scale production. The BBS has
    enabled Sankyo to produce more sophisticated products at a
    lower cost than other companies. We are now manufacturing the
    majority of our mass-produced products overseas. </p>
    <p>Sankyo's accumulated FA technology enables the Company to
    develop and promote such products as multiple processing
    machines, automatic assembly equipment and industrial robots.
    As we approach the 21<sup>st</sup> century, Sankyo, through
    its diverse lines ranging from industrial products to
    household appliances, aims to increase its contributions to
    society. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><b>QUALITY FIRST</b> </p>
    <p>Sankyo has continued to improve its quality control
    technology, for which it won a Deming Prize in 1976, as well
    as strengthen its expertise in such key technologies as we
    continue the Company's established work on optomechatronics
    technology. Sankyo also gains considerable benefit from
    research and development carried out in cooperation with its
    close business partner, Nippon Steel Corporation. Using the
    new technologies developed with Nippon Steel, Sankyo creates
    innovative products for communications, health, office
    automation and household-related areas. <br>

    <p><img src="mbox.jpg" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="206"
    height="132"><font color="#FF0000" size="5"><b>MUSICAL
    PRODUCTS DIVISION</b></font> </p>
    <p>Sankyo's operations are rooted in the Musical Products
    Division. The Company holds the largest share of the world
    market for musical movements.</p>
    <p>The key to Sankyo's dominance of the market is its ability
    to offer the world's most reliable musical movements at a
    highly competitive price. It has been able to do so by
    implementing the world's first mass-production methods for
    these products. This kind of self-reliance is a cornerstone
    of Sankyo's corporate philosophy.</p>
    <p>Traditionally, the manufacture of musical movements was a
    highly labor-intensive process. Recently however, increasing
    automation has meant tremendous leaps in production and
    assembly capability. By automating nearly all processes,
    Sankyo has increased productivity and achieved uniform
    quality-critical factors in supporting Sankyo's dominance of
    the musical movements industry.</p>
    <p>The Company's presence in the industry is not limited to
    Japan. Sankyo maintains an international manufacturing
    presence in Malaysia and Taiwan, and since January 1995 in
    Guangzhou, China. We also have a marketing presence in the
    U.S., Europe and Hong Kong. </p>
    <p>Musical movements-and the music boxes that depend on
    them-have a 200-year history. Before the invention of the
    phonograph in 1877, the only instrument available that did
    not require a musician to play it was the music box. They
    were difficult to acquire and treasured by the few who could
    afford them. During this century, musical movements have
    changed, partially as a result of the mass-production
    technology pursued by Sankyo, and music boxes have become
    widely available. </p>
    <p>Sankyo has pursued the development of ever-richer sounding
    music boxes. The Company's top-of-the-line Orpheus series,
    marketed since 1985, features two-tune deluxe 50-note
    movements. This series has been very well received,
    particularly in the collectibles market. Furthermore, after
    years of R&amp;D, we introduced an 80-note disc music box in
    1995. The disc music box, which allows the listener to
    exchange discs and hear any number of tunes, took Europe and
    the U.S. by storm in the days before the phonograph rose to
    prominence. One hundred years have passed since then, and now
    the disc music box is making a comeback as businesses and
    hobbyists create a new market for its gorgeous sounds. </p>
    <p>The advance of production technology has led to a
    diversification of function. Sankyo is now aggressively
    developing new products in a wide range of fields based on
    the technologies accumulated through the creation and
    improvement of music boxes. Soft-ejecting mechanisms are just
    one example. New applications of our Eou's melody integrated
    circuit units have enabled us to create special new products
    where small, thin, lightweight formats are required.
    Furthermore, Sankyo is also manufacturing superior 30-note
    and 50-note movements for luxury-class music boxes. </p>
    <p>Since 1985, the Company's Suwa Plant has been dedicated to
    producing quality musical movements. The entire manufacturing
    process of the plant-from the requisition of raw materials to
    product shipment-is integrated and fully automated. Strict
    process and quality control management in this plant led to
    its winning a Nihon Keizai Shimbun (Japan Economic Journal)
    national advanced plant award for excellence in 1987 and a
    Japan Plant Maintenance Foundation first class award for
    excellence in plant maintenance in 1993. <br>

    <p>To strengthen our electronic component businesses, which
    encompass such products as DC micromotors, AC servomotors,
    optical pickups and magnetic heads, we integrated marketing,
    development, production and overseas strategies for the
    Motors, Devices and Electromagnetic Components Divisions in
    July 1994. This headquarters system allows us to combine
    strong points that were previously dispersed among these
    different divisions. </p>
    <p>Through this reorganization, the common functions of the
    three divisions have been divided into an Operation Planning
    Division and a Marketing &amp; Sales Division from the
    business divisions was particularly helpful in improving
    customer service and the collection of market information,
    while also making it possible for us to offer products that
    more closely match customer needs.</p>
    <p>Also, by giving the R&amp;D Center the rank of a new

<p align="center"><font color="#0000FF" size="4"><b>SCARA Robots</b></font></p>

<p>The acronym SCARA stands for Selective Compliance Assembly
Robot Arm, a particular design developed in the late 1970s in the
laboratory of Professor Hiroshi Makino of Yamanashi University,
located in Kofu, Japan. The basic configuration of a SCARA is a
four degree-of-freedom robot with horizontal positioning
accomplished by a combined Theta 1 and Theta 2 motion, much like
a shoulder and elbow held perfectly parallel to the ground. The
combination of Theta 1 and Theta 2 form the defining structure of
the SCARA. The two linked arms comply slightly in the horizontal,
but remain rigid in the vertical. Thus the most basic assembly
task of putting a peg into a hole is now much easier as the SCARA
will comply slightly from side-to-side, but it will not typically
tilt or jam the peg in at an angle.</p>

<p>At the end of the Theta 1 and Theta 2 linked arms is the
Z-axis, which provides a powerful down and up motion, vertical to
the X-Y plane (the table top). In conjunction with the Z is the
Roll axis, which orients the end-of-arm to the workpiece.
Typically a gripping mechanism or other tool is attached to the
end of the Z-axis and it can be raised or lowered, rotated
clockwise or counter clockwise, or positioned quickly anywhere
within the defined X-Y workspace.</p>

<p>SCARAs are know for their fast cycle times, excellent
repeatability, good payload capacity and a large workspace,
shaped somewhat like a donut. SCARAs also feature sophisticated
motion control with full programmability. With its torso-based,
one arm design, the SCARA integrates easily into most
applications.</p>

<p>For flexible, high speed parts assembly and handling, consider
a SCARA, one of the most useful and flexible automation tools
available.</p>

<h2><font color="#0000FF">Sankyo&#146;s SCARAs - The Perfect

        the future. . . <h3><font color="#0000FF">A Family of
        SCARAs . . .</font></h3>
        <p>Thousands of Sankyo&#146;s SCARAs have been used in a
        wide variety of manufacturing environments since 1981,
        some of which require special features of robot design.
        Based on this collective experience, Sankyo is proud to
        offer four different versions of its SR84xx SCARA Series,
        each version customized to perform reliably in a
        particular environment.</p>
        <p><font color="#FF0000"><b><i>Industrial:</i></b></font>
        Sankyo&#146;s base SCARA design is for typical industrial
        environments with an operating temperature of 0 to 40
        degrees C, a relative humidty from 8 to 80%, and a
        general environment conducive to workers without any
        special protective garb. Sankyo SR84xx SCARAs have
        performed flawlessly in these types of environments, 24
        hours per day, seven days per week, year in and year out.</p>
        <p><font color="#FF0000"><b><i>Cleanroom:</i></b> </font>For
        cleanroom, the SR8437C and SR8438C Class 10 (0.30 m
        particle size) SCARA versions are available. The Class 10
        SCARAs incorporate special seals, finishing, paint,
        grease, screws and require a vacuum source to evacuate
        the particulates captured inside the arm. These systems
        have been well-proven in the disk-drive industry.</p>
        <p><font color="#FF0000"><b><i>Dust Proof:</i></b></font>
        For environments with heavier particulates, the SR8437DP
        and SR8438DP versions are available. These dust-proof
        SCARAs incorporate special seals and covers, a Z-axis
        bellows, and light positive air pressure to keep the
        particulates out of the interior of the arm. These
        dust-proof systems meet the International
        Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) Index of Protection
        rating of IP5x.</p>
        <p><font color="#FF0000"><b><i>Splash Proof:</i></b> </font>For
        environments consisting of splashing water or cutting
        fluids, the SR8547WP and SR8438WP versions are available.
        The spalsh-proof SCARAs incorporate special seals and
        covers and a Z-axis bellows. Many Sankyo splash-proof
        SCARAs have been incorporated into Sankyo-built machining
        centers and transfer lines with cutting fluids splashing
        freely. These splash-proof SCARAs meet IEC&#146;s Index
        of Protection rating of Ipx4.</p>
        <h3><font color="#0000FF">Customization</font></h3>
        <p>A variety of other options, versions and features for
        Sankyo&#146;s SCARAs have been developed over the years
        and Sankyo is pleased to make these available as
        conditions require. This list includes longer versions of
        the basic SR84xx SCARAs, such as the SR8437 with a 1000
        mm reach; longer Z-heads &#150; up to 550 mm for the
        SR8437 and up to 250 mm for the SR8438; slide-type Z-axes
        for mounting various types of screw and nut drivers;
        side-mounted cable interfaces for tighter integration
        into the workspace; and special paint colors to match
        specific system designs. Other variations will also be
        considered on a case by case basis. </p>

<p align="center"><font color="#0000FF" size="4"><b>Cartesian
Coordinate Robots</b></font></p>

<p>CCRs are highly configurable, rectilinear robot systems which,
in a basic configuration, include an X and Y axis. Three axis
CCRs, incorporating an X, Y, and Z axis, are also common for
positioning tools, such as dispensers, cutters, drivers, and
routers. Each of the axis lengths are selectable, with the
ability to attach different types of Z-heads. Payloads and speeds
vary based on axis length and support structures. CCRs are also
typically very repeatable, have better inherent accuracy than a
SCARA or jointed arm, and perform 3D path-dependent motions with
relative ease. However, the CCR&#146;s key feature is its
configurability &#150; the ability you have to configure and size
the CCR to best meet your application needs. </p>

<p>Best of all, you pay only for the axes you really need! If two
axes are required, you buy a 2-axis CCR and save. If three axes,
you buy a 3-axis CCR. If four axes are needed, you have the
choice of using a SCARA or a CCR system, which ever best meets
your application needs. If odd configurations are required, then
the flexibility of CCR systems gives you many more possibilities
to consider.</p>

<p><font color="#0000FF">The Sankyo CCR-M Series - Configured
CCRs Ready to Go!</font></p>

<p>In today&#146;s competitive world, you don&#146;t have the
time or the staff to worry about attaching a Z axis to a Y axis
to an X axis, routing your cables in a reliable manner, finding
cable tracks and supports, or ensuring that your newly assembled
system is safe to use. If you want to be productive on the job,
if you want solutions with reliable designs, if you want to be
able &quot;plug and go&quot; to better meet those critical dates,
then what you need are Sankyo Cartesian Coordinate Robot Systems,
each already configured to your specification, each UL approved,
and each ready to be integrated into your application, right out
of the crate.</p>

<p>Sankyo&#146;s Configured CCRs, the CCR-M Series, have already
been proven in hundreds of installations and have many exciting
and useful features to make your job easier, your schedules
shorter, and your production better. </p>

<ul>
    <li>The CCR-M robots incorporate a modern industrial design
        and are delivered assembled and tested with integrated,
        well-managed cabling. You simply plug the CCR system in,
        attach the controller and pendant, and turn it on. Now
        you&#146;re ready to develop the application program and
        keep on schedule.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Large wattage brushless AC servo motors are used for the
        X and Y axes, and each axis utilizes an AC motor with an
        absolute encoder. No homing is required! Motors can be
        mounted in-line to the axis or in a parallel fashion
        (belt-driven) to minimize space requirements.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Each of the linear axes use cold-drawn steel frames with
        integrated double rails, precision ball screws, and
        double blocks on the X and Ys. The Y-axis is attached to
        the X-axis with a machined cast iron bracket. Given the
        opportunity, one can easily feel how solid these systems
        are.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>For the smaller configurations, cantilevered designs are
        very typical. For the configurations with longer Y axes
        or heavier payloads, a rail system is available to
        support the non-powered end of the Y-axis.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Many standard configurations are available to include
        X-Y, X-Y-Z, and X-Y-Z-Roll systems. For applications
        requiring the ability to reach into a device, there is an
        X with a reaching Y and an X-Z with a reaching Y.
        Additional configurations and orientations are possible.
        Just let us know what you need.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Five basic head designs, of various sizes, are available
        off the shelf. A simple pneumatic Z, a servo-slide Z, a
        servo-axial Z, a servo-axial Z with a servo-Roll, and a
        standalone servo-Roll. Each can be mounted to almost any
        of the X-Y configurations.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>There are two special versions of the CCR-M Series; the
        CCR-M Lite Systems for smaller, lighter payload
        applications, and the CCR-M Long Systems for axis lengths
        exceeding 800 mm. Both add to the variety of solutions
        available from Sankyo.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Motion on all CCR-Ms is fully programmable with flexible
        digital I/O control. There are also 3D linear and
        circular motion for path-dependent applications, built-in
        palletizing commands, and &quot;jump moves&quot; for
        higher speed pick and place.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>The CCR-M Series, combined with the SC3000 controller and
        Touch Screen Pendant, are UL and cUL approved, perhaps
        the only CCRs in the industry to be approved. They also
        meet RIA R15.06 and European EN775 Safety Standards.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sankyo&#146;s Configured CCRs, the CCR-M Series, offer you
high quality and reliability, in addition to the convenience and
features listed above. Once you have the chance to see a CCR-M
system, to feel its strength, to see it perform, you&#146;ll then
know that the CCR-M Series from Sankyo is for your manufacturing
needs today and into the future&#133;</p>

<h3><font color="#0000FF">General CCR Specifications:</font></h3>

<p>CCR-M specifications are very dependent on the actual
configuration of the system. In general, the key specifications

<p align="center"><font color="#0000FF" size="4"><b>Track-Mounted
SCARAs (TM-SCARA)</b></font></p>

<p><font color="#0000FF"><b>Sankyo Robotics</b></font> has
unveiled an exciting extension to its SCARA product line called
the <i>TM-SCARA</i>, which stands for Track-Mounted SCARA. The
TM-SCARA is comprised of a Sankyo SR8437 or SR8438 SCARA and a
servo-controlled track, measuring from 1 meter to 10 meters in
length. The track-axis incorporates either a ball-screw or rack
&amp;&nbsp;pinion drive. Speeds of the track-axis are dependent
on the length and type of drive used, however up to 1000 mm/sec
is achievable. The effective workspace of a stationary SCARA is
dramatically increased, allowing the precise, 4-axis robot to be
applied to even more tasks to increase its utilization. The
TM-SCARAs are also available for Class 10 cleanroom environments
and prove very useful in the disk-drive industry, to move
cassettes of disks between processes, or in the medical industry,
to handle materials or samples from process to process. Some
customization is also possible to accommodate height and length
requirements. </p>

<p>The TM-SCARA is controlled by the Sankyo SC3200 controller,
which is a higher capacity version of the SC3000 controller. The
SC3200, in a slightly bigger package, has the power and
amplifiers to control from 5 to 8 axes. It also features the
exciting-to-use Touch Screen Pendant for point teaching,
application control, and for system monitoring.</p>

<p align="center"><font color="#0000FF" size="4"><b>Cleanroom
Robotics</b></font></p>

<p><font color="#0000FF"><b>Sankyo Robotics</b></font> offers a
variety of proven cleanroom robotic systems for the handling of
wafers, disks, LCDs, MLCs, and for the assembly of disk drives
and other special subsystems. Sankyo's cleanroom robot systems
are Class 1, 10, or 100 capable, with designs that benefit from
more than 10 years of extensive research and actual application
use. Many special techniques are used in combinations to ensure
the cleanliness that is required:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Sealing off the interior of the robot arm and then
        evacuating it so that all generated particulates are
        removed in a controlled manner.</li>
    <li>Internal robot and peripheral cabling so that
        particulates created by the inevitable rubbing and
        flexing can be captured and evacuated as part of the
        interior evacuation process.</li>
    <li>Special coatings and treatment of the various external
        robot surfaces and the use of stainless steel screws and
        special washers to minimize&nbsp;exterior-generated
        particulates.</li>
    <li>Proprietary fluorine-based greases with very minimal
        particulate production to lubricate any exposed moving
        surface, such as the splined shafts of the
        SR8437C&nbsp;and SR8438C SCARAs.</li>
    <li>Brushless servo motors which greatly reduces the number
        of particulates generated inside the robot arm.</li>
    <li>Special clean dust covers and evacuation schemes to
        minimize any particulate generation by linear axes.</li>
    <li>Arm configurations which position the cleanest parts of
        the robot arm over the sensitive product, such as with
        the CC-SCARA(TM) and CW-SCARA(TM) products.</li>
</ul>

<p>Various techniques have been used to certify a robot's design
and related cleaning techniques, but ultimately the customer's
satisfaction is what is most important. With more than 1000
Sankyo robots installed in cleanrooms throughout the world, this
is proof of Sankyo's cleanroom expertise and exceptional
performance of its cleanroom robot systems.</p>

<p>Here is a list of some of Sankyo's cleanroom robot systems:</p>

<ul>
    <li>SR8437C SCARA with 250mm Z axis</li>
    <li>SR8437C SCARA with 550mm Z axis</li>
    <li>SR8438C SCARA with 150mm Z axis</li>

<p><font color="#0000FF"><b>Sankyo Robotics</b></font> is a
worldwide provider of <font color="#0000FF"><i>precision,
industrial robot systems</i></font> for the assembly, handling,
fabrication and positioning of small parts, typically weighing in
the 1 to 10 Kg range. Having sold its first commercial robot
system in 1981, Sankyo has since installed over 12,000 robot
systems worldwide, including over 3,500 through an
OEM&nbsp;relationship with IBM. Sankyo's robots have been very
successfully installed in many different industries, including
automotive, electronics, computer, semiconductor, and medical.
The result is that Sankyo has great robotic and applications
knowledge, which is the direct result of over 18 years of
experience in the industry. Sankyo also uses its robot systems in
its own manufacturing facilities, including a new manufacturing
facility located near Indianapolis, Indiana, in which nine Sankyo
SCARA robots and palletizing systems are used.</p>

<p>Sankyo is best known for producing robot systems with <font
color="#0000FF"><i>excellent performance, very high reliability,
good on-site serviceability, with an extra emphasis on safety</i></font>.
Sankyo's standard robot products are UL&nbsp;and cUL approved and
meet RIA R15.06 and European EN775 safety standards. Sankyo also
works closely with its customers to customize its systems to
better meet unique needs. This customization can take the form of
longer axis lengths, special cabling, environmental enclosures,
or other custom designs.</p>

<p>Sankyo Robotics has marketing, sales and support organizations
located in Boca Raton, Florida, and Santa Clara, California, for
the Americas, Dusseldorf, Germany, for Europe, and in Tokyo and
Osaka, Japan, for Japan and Asia. </p>

<TITLE>Medical treatment of obesity</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY><P><B>Successful medical treatment for obesity has been
discovered.</B>
<P>Recently there have been some major scientific breakthroughs
in the treatment of obesity. Treatment is desperately needed as obesity increases
ones risk of many other diseases. Everyone is familiar with these, they include
diabetes mellitus, heart disease, gout, osteoarthyritis, gallbladder disease,
and even cancer. Obese people do not live as long as non obese people. Obesity
also takes a great toll on a person's self esteem.
<P>No one wants to be obese, but most who are can not seem to do anything
about it. Obesity has been considered to be a personal weakness, but we now
have evidence that it is a medical illness. It is gneetic and probably can
not be cured. Most people last only two weeks or less on a diet. Even the
successful dieters almost alwaysgain their weight back within a short time.
The hypothalamus of the brain and other structures in the brain work to maintain
your weight, sometimes called the "set point". This yo-yo effect is probably
worse than no weight loss at all. It probably leads to an increased percentage
of fat in the body. Fat is less metabolically active and this leads to even
more weight gain. With each successive cycle, weight is regained faster and
weight loss takes longer.
<P>This sounds discouraging but there is good news. Obesity can be treated
like other chronic medical illnesses, such as diabetes or hypertension. It
requires chronic treatment. I believe obesity is caused by a chemical imbalance
in the brain that is inharited or results from the mutation of one or more
genes. Scientists have discovered an obesity gene in humane chromosomes.
It leads to food cravings and an underactive metabolism. The more the cravings
are resisted, the stronger they become.
<P>The new treatment starts with correcting the chemical imbalances. We now
have drugs that increase brain levels of serotonin and dopamine. These seem
to be a major factor in this disease. With these medications, food obsessions
disappear and you can feel full throughout the day and be more analytical
about your eating. Having corrected the chemical imbalance, food cravings
and slow metabolism are corrected, and a healthy diet can be followed.
<P>Two of the drugs available now are phentermine and fenfluramine. They
both affect the brains neurotransmitters. Phentermine enhances dopamine and
norepinephrine. This causes people to eat faster but eat less. Fenfluramine
acts on seratonin and plays a large role in reducing the feelings or agitation
and deprivation that are associated with hunger. Serotonin also controls
how much we eat, and the body's desire for protein and carbohydrates. The
medication will not let you overeat. You can lose weight without doing anything.
It will all come naturally as a result of normalizing your body chemistry.
<P>Simple behavior modification can then be implemented such as not buying
high calorie and high fat foods, not eating out at fast food restaurants,
eating slower, off a smaller plate, with smaller utensils. Drinking more
water during the day. Only eating in one place in the house, etc.
<P>Exercise is, of course, also important. Activity can be increased even
if you do not have a lot of extra time to go to the gym. You can use the
stairs instead of the elevator, walk instead of driving when possible, etc.
If you have some extra tome, then do something you enjoy to exercise your
muscles, like walking, dancing, bike riding, etc.
<P>The key is that the treatment must be long term, probably life long. If
the medication is stopped, the chemical imbalance will return and so will
the food cravings. It is just as if you stop your blood pressure medicine,
you blood pressure will again become elevated. The new medications are not
habit forming and work over the long term. This is much different from the
old appetite suppressants.
<P>In our office we have been treating patients with this new method very
successfully. It will require an initial orientation that lasts about an
hour and once monthly office visits for monitoring and fine tuning the program
and for prescription refills. The cost is only $50 per month for this service,
plus the cost of the medication.

<TITLE>Redux</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY><P><FONT SIZE=+1>Redux- A New Antiobesity Medication</FONT>
<P>Redux, also called dexfenfluramine, &nbsp;is now available with a prescription
in the US. It is useful for weight loss and maintenance of weigh loss. It
has been used in other countries since 1985. It is a seratonin reuptake inhibitor
and releasing medication. This means it increases the level of a brain chemical
called seratonin. It causes a reduction in appitite and a slowing of stomach
emptying. Studies have shown that redux along with a reduced-calorie diet
produces a significant reduction in weight over 4 to 6 months. Patients are
able to maintain their weight loss by continuing to take the medication.
<P>Patients with pulmonary hypertension should not take the medication. It
should be used with caution in patients with glaucoma or who are elderly.
It is not recommended to be used during pregnancy. It should also be used
cautiously with antidepressants or migraine medication. Possible side effects
are headaches, drowsiness, diarrhea, vomiting, depression, vertigo, chills,
thirst, and frequent urination.

Program</B>
<P>
<P>Constipation.
<P>Eat 2 metamucil wafers daily followed by a glass of water. These make
a good snack and solve the constipation problem. They can be purchased at
the grocery store or a pharmacy.
<P>
<P>Dry mouth
<P>This is the most common side effect patients have. It may continue for
several months. It helps remind you to drink water which is desirable for
a weight loss program.
<P>
<P>Dizzy
<P>This usually comes from hypoglycemia. We recommend small frequent meals
to prevent blood sugar levels from getting too low.
<P>
<P>Headaches
<P>These are also usually caused by not eating often enough or not eating
enough protein to sustain blood sugar levels.
<P>
<P>Jittery and irritable
<P>This is a result of the stimulant effect of the phentermine. It is usually
a temporary side effect which will spontaneously disappear in two to three
days. Try to reduce other stimulants such as caffeine or nicotine during
this time. If the irritability persists and is not due to hypoglycemia, the
dosage of pondamin may need to be increased to balance the phentermine.
<P>
<P>Insomnia
<P>Most patients who experience this symptom will get over it in two to three
days. Taking the phentermine early and not consuming other stimulants such
as coffee or nicotine during this time can help. An over the counter benadryl
capsule can help if necessary.
<P>
<P>Prolonged menstrual bleeding or spotting
<P>This symptom is occasionally present. Taking 600mg of ibuprofen three
times a day will usually stop the bleeding. Ibuprofen is available without
a prescription.
<P>
<P>If you are having problems you can not resolve, please call us or
<A HREF="mail.htm">email </A>us before stopping the program.

<TITLE>Eating schedule</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY><P>Suggested eating schedule while on weight loss medication
<P>Take your phentermine and pondamine early in the day. This makes it easy
to remember to take them.
<P>Eat small amounts of food every one to two hours. Your brain needs to
be feed all day. If you go without eating for three or more hours you will
develop symptoms of hypoglycemia. These symptoms include: headaches, fatigue,
light headedness, drowsiness, shakiness, poor concentration.
<P>Protein foods are prefered because they sustain you longer. Foods like
soda, candy, cakes, and cookies convert quickly to glucose but are quickly
used up and can actually cause worse hypoglycemia later. 
<P><B>Breakfast</B>
<P>Cereal with non-fat milk, bran muffins, or oatmeal, etc.
<P><B>Snack</B>
<P>Fruit with a granola bar, glass of non-fat milk, low fat cheese or wheat
crackers.
<P><B>Small lunch</B>
<P>Fruit, vegetables, meats,carrots, jell-O, yogurt, crackers, tuna fish,
etc.
<P><B>Snack</B>
<P>Protein "Power Bars", yogurt, fruit, trail mix, etc.
<P><B>Small dinner</B>
<P>Anthing like the examples above. It will be eaier to choose lower fat,
high fiber foods while on medication
<P><B>Snack</B>
<P>An after dinner snack is also recommended.
<P>Some examples of protein foods without meat: Bread, cereal, beans, lentils,
brown rice, sunflower seeds, low fat peanut butter, tofu, corn, tortillas,
soy foods, trail mix, weat germ.

<TITLE>Hypoglycemia</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY><P ALIGN=Center><FONT SIZE=+1><FONT SIZE=+1>Hypoglycemia and
Obesity</FONT></FONT>
<P>We at Kind Care Medical Center believe that obesity is often a result
of chronic reactive hypoglycemia. A cycle develops when someone consumes
foods that are high in sugar or carbohydrates that metabolize rapidly to
sugar. This concentrated sugar stimulates the pancreas to release insulin
into the blood. Insulin causes the sugar to be removed from the blood. Often
an excessive amount of insulin is released and this causes low blood sugar.
The brain needs a constant supply of sugar to function. When it senses blood
sugars are dropping certain symptoms develop. These symptoms include severe
hunger and craving sweets. The individual then over eats and eats foods that
provide quick sugar. This becomes an endless cycle that causes obesity. We
use medication and a hypoglycemic diet to reverse this pattern.
<P>
<P>Dr. Seale Harris first discovered hypoglycemia in 1924. He was an
Endocrinologist who noticed a similarity between his patients that took too
much insulin and some of his other patients. He published an artical in the
Journal of the American Medical Association. 
<P>
<P>Sugar and caffeine are prime causes of pancreatic overactivity and consequent
chronic low blood sugar. We are eating an abnormal diet. The average American
eats 1 teaspoon of sugar every 35 minutes, 24 hours a day. Ancient man did
not have concentrated starch or sugar. His body used small amounts with great
efficiency. It manufactured small amounts at a time from other types of food.
Modern man, programmed to use only a little starch or sugar with great
effeciency, is trying to cope with more than 250 pounds of highly concentrated
sugar, flour, and cereals a year.
<P>
<P>Another name for hypoglycemia is hyperinsulinism. The pancreas is over
responsive to sugar. Chronic over stimulation of the pancrease can cause
exhaustion and diabetes. The pancreas may also be fooled into responding
to the sweet taste of sugar substitutes. Proteins do not pull the insulin
trigger like sugar and starch do. The diet should be low in sugar and starch.
<P>
<P>Some symptoms of hypoglycemia:
<UL><LI>Hugh appitite between meals.
<LI>Trembling when getting hungry
<LI>Slowing down or palpitations when not eating in time
<LI>Irritable before meals
<LI>Sleepy after meals
<LI>Sleep attacks during the day and/or wake at night
<LI>Cravings for sweets
<LI>Can not function without sugar, coffee, coke, alcohol, cigarettes
<LI>Headaches in the afternoon or evening
<LI>Lack of concentration
<LI>Dizziness

</H2><P>
<UL><LI>Replace the usual 3 large meals with 6 small meals.
<LI>In each or the small daily meals, take a protein such as meat, fish,
fowl, milk, cheese, or eggs.
<LI>Reduce the total intake of carbohydrates, especially sugar.
<LI>Do not drink alcoholic beverages, regular coffee or strong tea, chocolate,
cocoa, or colas. No not use artificial sweeteners
</UL><P>
<P>Eating frequent small meals stabilizes the blood sugar levels, avoids
transient starvation and sudden rises and drops in blood sugar levels. This
pattern of eating also helps control the cholesterol. The rise in blood
cholesterol is less when the meals are frequent and small. This pattern of
eating also makes it easier to reduce weight, not only because it helps bring
appetite under control, but because the body appears to burn more calories
when the same amount of food is consumed in smaller, more frequent meals.

</HEAD><BODY><P ALIGN=Center><FONT SIZE=+1><FONT SIZE=+1>A Major Wellness
Discovery</FONT></FONT>
<P ALIGN=Center><FONT SIZE=+1><FONT SIZE=+1>Above and Beyond
Phen-Fen</FONT></FONT>
<P>In the last year we at Kind Care Medical Clinic have been seriously studying
the causes and medical treatment of obesity. We have treated over 1000 patients
so far using the phentermin and fenfluramine combination of medication. We
have used it ourselves. We closely observed our feelings and behaviors. We
intensly studied our patient's diets, feelings, and weight loss. Observations
lead us to search the medical liturature and even out-of-the-ordinary sources
to try and understand better this disease. Our think tank includes Karin
Healy RN, Ingrid Iwaszko RN, and myself.
<P>
<P>Gradually we made some discoveries that are contradictory to what we have
traditionally been taught about diet and weight loss. First we noticed that
our patients were complaining of feeling tired, dizzy, having headaches,
shaky, hungry, and craving sweets. At first we thought these were side effects
of the medication. But then it struck us that this sounds like hypoglycemia.
These are the effects of low blood sugar on the nervous system. We started
recommending that our patients eat more often. To eat six times per day instead
of three. This seemed to help the symptoms and lead us to do further research
on hypoglycemia.
<P>
<P>We are most familiar with hypoglycemia in diabetics that have taken too
much insulin or have not eaten at their regular time. We became interested
in the role of insulin in metabolism, especially in people suffering from
obesity. 
<P>
<P>We know that insulin is needed for us to use and store sugar for energy.
But insulin has some effects that are not desirable. It converts glucose
and protein to fat and converts fat we eat to stored fat in our body. It
increases the body's production of cholesterol. It makes the kidneys retain
more fluid. It thickens the walls of arteries.
<P>
<P>Too much insulin makes you gain weight. It makes your cholesterol and
your blood pressure rise. There is another hormone in the body that balances
insulin called glucagon. It raises blood sugar and causes some desirable
effects. It makes our body burn fat and decreases the body's production of
cholesterol. It makes the kidneys release excess water and opens the thickened
arterial walls.
<P>
<P>We have been told to eat low fat diets. That usually means you will be
eating a low protein diet also. This is because most protein comes from animals
and comes with fat. That leaves only carbohydrates for us to eat. But a high
carbohydrate diet stimulates the pancrease to release a large amount of insulin
and very little glucagon. Protein stimulates a only a modest amount of insulin
release and stimulates more glucagon release. Fat has very little effect
on insulin or glucagon.
<P>
<P>Gradually our cells become more and more resistant to insulin on a high
carbohydrate diet. The pancrease has to release more to have the same effect
on sugar levels. This results in a state of hyperinsulinemia.
<P>
<P>Hyperinsulinemia exagerates all the undesirable effects of &nbsp;insulin.
It leads to diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and high cholesterol. And these
diseases usually terminate in cardiovascular related deaths from stroke or
heart attack.
<P>
<P>Our search for a cure for obesity has lead us to a discovery that could
help reduce the other main chronic deseases of our time. This discovery is
that instead of eating a low fat, high carbohydrate diet, we should be eating
a high protein, low carbohydrate diet. The emphesis is on low carbohydrates.
The nutrition we need to sustain us should come mostly from protein. The
fat that is associated with most proteins is not a major problem.
<P>
<P>The concept we use now in our weight control program is to use the medications
phentermine and fenfluramine to remove cravings for carbohydrates. The medication
seems to make people more consious of what they eat. This gives us the
opportunity to reprogram a person's eating behavior. Now we have a better
idea of how the new program should be designed.
<P>
<P>Now protein is king and carbohydrates are the enemy. This is a simple
concept and very logical. It is however the opposite of what we are used
to hearing. This new paradigm, I believe, &nbsp;is a major step towards
preventing and reversing obesity and many of the other chronic diseases of
our time.
<P>
<P>We at Kind Care Medical Center will continue our research and seek to
steadily improve our treatments for obesity and other preventitive measures.
<P>
<P>Sincerely,
<P>

They often feel that they do not eat that much. They think it has 
something to do with their metabolism. Physicians generally do not 
agree with this. We usually measure the levels of thyroid hormone and if
they are normal we say that metabolism is not the reason for the 
obesity. New information indicates that there may indeed be a 
metabolic cause for obesity and it is not related to the thyroid 
hormones. The key hormones are insulin and glucagon. These then are 
a major factor in the regulation of hundreds of other little-known, 
difficult to measure hormones.
<P>&nbsp;
<P>There is an optimal balance of these many hormones that leads to 
optimal health and optimal weight. The key is the insulin and glucagon 
balance. Too much insulin in the blood leads to suboptimal hormone 
balance in general. Insulin levels in the blood are controlled by what you
eat. Primarily the relative amount of protein to carbohydrate in your 
diet. Studies have shown that the ideal ratio is 3 grams of protein to 4
grams of carbohydrtate in every meal. The food you eat can be thought 
of as a powerful drug. We know that drugs must be taken at prescribed 
intervals and in prescribed dosages. The new technology suggests that 
food be used the same way. To reach a state of optimal health you must 
eat food in a controlled fashion and in the proper proportions. Losing 
weight does not require will power, it does require information. If you 
control what you eat you do not have to be overly concerned with how 
much you eat.
<P>&nbsp;
<P>You must think of food not as a solurce of calories but as a control 
system for hormones. If you eat the right combination of foods, you tap 
into a hugh source of energy, your own stored body fat. With the wrong
combination the fat stores are inaccessible for use as energy for the next
4-6 hours.
<P>&nbsp;
<P>Exercise is also a modulator of hormones. The higher the intensity of
exercise, the more hormonal responses are affected. Higher intensity 
aerobic esercise reduces insulin levels, and increases levels of glucagon.
The intensity of exercise that induces an improved balance of hormones 
is between 60 and 80 percent of maximum heart rate. Jogging, 
swimming, or running can generate this level of intensity. Anaerobic 
esercise is also benificial. If the intensity is great enough, it causes
the 
body to release human growth hormone. Human growth hormone is the 
most powerful gat burning hormone in the body. It burns fat, and it 
allows you to build new muscle at the same time. Growth hormone is 
also released during sleep; during stage 3 and 4 sleep just prior to 
REM. Insulin is a powerful inhibitor of human growth hormone.
<P>&nbsp;
<P>Obesity is not weight gain, it is the accumulation of excess body fat.
Ideally a male should have about 15% body fat and a female should 
have 22% body fat.
<P>&nbsp;
<P>The liver can store only 60-90 grams of carbohydrate as glycogen. This
is the only reserve source of glucose for the brain from carbohydrate. 
The brain uses 2/3 of the circulating carbohydrats that you use at rest.
The muscles can store 300-400 grams of carbohydrate, but this is not 
available to the brain. Once the storage areas in the liver and muscle are
full, the rest of the carbohydrates you eat end up as fat. Insulin 
stimulated by excess carbohydrates aggressively promotes the 
accumulation of body fat. Excess carbohydrates in your diet not only 
make you fat, they make sure you stay fat.
<P>&nbsp;
<P>Glucose is found in grains, pastas, bread, cereals, starches, and 
vegetables. Fructose is primarily found in fruits. Galactose is found in
dairy products. Galactose and fructose must be converted to glucose 
before releasing back to the blood. The higher the fiber content of a
carbohydrate, the slower the rate of entry into the blood stream.
<P>&nbsp;
<P>It is genetically impossible to lose more than 1 to 1.5 pounds per week
of body fat. You can lose more weight, but it will be primarily water 
loss and muscle mass loss. People on quick weight loss programs look 
haggard because they are losing muscle mass.
<P>&nbsp;
<P>Twenty five percent of people have blunted insulin responses. They can
eat more carbohydrates and not get fat. Twenty five percent have 
extremely elevated insulin responses to carbohydrates. They simply 
have to look at carbohydrates to begin gaining fat.
<P>&nbsp;
<P>The symptoms of protein malnutrition include a weakned immune 
system, loss of muscle mass, and hair loss. The amount of protein you 
need depends on three factors: weight, percent body fat, and level of 
activity. Spread your protein intake evenly throughout the day.
<P>&nbsp;
<P>Restrict bad fats; which are arachidonic acid and saturated fat. Get 
most or your fat from monounsaturated fat.
<P>&nbsp;
<P>Stay on the perimeter of the supermarket when you shop.
<P>&nbsp;
<P>The amount of protein that can fit on the palm of your hand is about 4
oz. or 28 grams. The size of the carbohydrate portion should be about 
twice as big as your protein portion in the amount of space it occupies 
on your plate.
<P>&nbsp;
<P>Whenever you have a problem with hunger or carbohydrate cravings, 
look to your last meal for a clue to the reason why.
<P>&nbsp;
<P>If you are fat and shaped like an apple, you are hyperinsulinemic. High
triglyceride levels are an indication of hyperinsulinemia. 
Hyperinsulinemia may be the primary risk factor for heart attacks. 
Insulin will be increased by eating too much food at any one meal or too
much carbohydrate.
<P>&nbsp;
<P>Restricted are high density, high glycemic, carbohydrates like grains,
breads, pasta, rice, and starches. Also restricted are protein sources 
rich in arachidonic acid like egg yolks, fatty red meats, and organ 
meats.

<TITLE>Risk of primary pulmonary hypertension</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY><P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center><FONT SIZE=+1><FONT SIZE=+1>Risks of using weight control
medication</FONT></FONT>.
<P>&nbsp; 
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;My patients frequently ask me about the risks involved in
taking weight loss medication. They are especially concerned with a lung
disease called primary pulmonary hypertension that has been mentioned on
some of the tabloid TV programs. &nbsp;There was a study published in the
New England Journal of Medicine earlier this year and then updated on August
29, 1996 that is the basis for all the negitive publicity on weight control
drugs. The purpose of the study was to try and find out what are the factors
that lead to this rare disease. It was found to occur most frequently in
women in their twenties and thirties. Recent pregnancy may have a causitive
role. There is a genetic susceptibility involved because it runs in certain
families. Outside factors are suspected also. These outside factors include
cocaine use, HIV infection, use of birth control pills , cirrosis of the
liver, and smoking. Obesity itself is associated with primary pulmonary
hypertension. 
<P>
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The study did not mention the dosages of weight control
medication used by their patients. The most common symptom was severe shortness
of breath. In most cases the diagnosis was not made until more than a year
after the symptoms started. If the diagnosis can be made earlier and the
medicine stopped, the condition can improve. This is one reason we closely
monitor our patients on weight control medication.
<P>
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In the same issue of the New England Journal of Medicine
an editorial was published by JoAnn Manson MD of Harvard Medical School that
puts the study in perspective. &nbsp;She states that obesity is now recognised
as a chronic disease that requires long-term treatment. Obesity is the second
leading cause of preventable death in the United States, exceeded only by
cigarette smoking. It is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease,
diabetes mellitus, and some cancers. It contributes to 300,000 deaths every
year in the United States. Even small amounts of weight loss are associated
with improved risk profiles. Dr. Manson states that at least 280 deaths per
million obese people could be prevented with weight loss medication. In addition
more than 400 non fatal heart attacks and strokes could be prevented. The
risk of pulmonary hypertension from &nbsp;weight loss medication is about
28 cases &nbsp;per million person years of exposure. This is approximately
the same as the risk of dying from penicillin, &nbsp;birth control pills,
or aspirin. She also states that several biasis may have inflated the estimates
of risk in the study.
<P>
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;From this data we find a <B>benifit to risk ratio
of &nbsp;20 to 1</B>
<P>
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Dr. Manson concludes that the risk of pulmonary
hypertension associated with weight control medication is small and appears
to be outweighed by the benifits when the drugs are used appropriately.

<TITLE>Fat Cell Metabolism</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY><P><FONT SIZE=+1><B>How Men and Women Differ in Fat Cell
Metabolism</B></FONT>
<P>Men are born with all the ingredients for burning fat through exercise.
These are lypolytic enzymes, more muscle mass, and more mitocondria. Lypolytic
enzymes help in the release of fat from the fat cell. &nbsp;Mitocondria are
the "powerhouses" of the cell. They convert calories to heat and water.
<P>
<P>Women are born with all the ingredients for storing fat. These are lypogenic
enzymes, less muscle mass, and less mitocondria. Lypogenic enzymes promote
the storing of fat.
<P>These are the reasons why men immediately lose fat with any exercise program.
They lose it quicker than women do and do not gain it back as easily.
<P>
<P>Women need lypolytic enzymes, more muscle mass and mitochondria. They
also need oxygen and time.
<P>So...
<P>1. You need moderate exercise with a constant supply of oxygen to stimulate
lypolytic enzymes.
<P>2. You need the lypolytic enzymes to release fat.
<P>3. You need at least 45 minutes for the oxygen to stimulate the lipolytic
enzymes and release a significant amount of fat.
<P>4. You need to work your muscles of the buttocks and thighs to burn the
fat that is released from the fat cell.
<P>5. You need mitochondria and oxygen in your muscles to burn the fat.
<P>
<P><FONT SIZE=+1><B>Fat-Burning Exercises for Women</B></FONT>
<P>1. Choose an aerobic exercise. One that uses the major muscle groups of
the buttocks and thighs. It should be a non-stop, rhythmic movement.
<P>2. It should be of moderate intensity. It is not necessary to get out
of breath. Oxygen is the key to releasing fat from the fat cells and burning
fat in the muscle cells.
<P>3. It should last a minimum of 45 minutes. It takes 20 to 30 minutes to
activate the lipolytic enzymes to release fat.
<P>4. Exercise a minimum of 3 times per week.
<P>5. Stimulate your muscle mass and mitochondria. Anerobic exercise will
increase your muscle mass and increase your mitochondria. Using weights is
an example of &nbsp;an anerobic exercise.

<TITLE>History of Kind Care Medical Center</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY><P ALIGN=Center><FONT SIZE=+1><FONT SIZE=+1><B>Our
History</B></FONT></FONT>
<P>My wife, Karin, and I opened our office on September 17, 1983. I was still
working at Cigna Health Plan in Long Beach during the day. We would work
in our new Duarte office from 5PM till 10PM and on the weekend to get the
practice going. We called the office Convenient Care Medical Clinic. We decided
to open in Duarte because Karin has lived here almost all her life. After
we were married in 1982 we moved into our own townhouse in Duarte. At first
the practice was very slow. We once went 4 days without a single patient.
In January of 1984 I gave up my job at Cigna and devoted all my time to the
new clinic. We were open 7 days a week from 9AM till 9PM including holidays.
I remember celebrating Mother's Day with a big dinner at the clinic. When
we started we had a 5 month old son.
<P>
<P>Our concept was to make it easy and pleasant to go to a doctor. We wanted
our patients to be comfortable. We did not require an appointment and we
were open long hours so patients could come when it was convenient for them.
They could also come right away if there was an injury or acute illness.
&nbsp;Our fees were set at a reasonable level to be affordable for patients
without insurance. We offered a multitude of services under one room to avoid
sending patients to several places for tests and treatments. &nbsp;We always
try to be considerate of our patients because they are our customers. We
understand the trouble and expence our patients experience to see us and
we appreciate it. Fortunatly the practice became a success.
<P>
<P>Hendrietta joined our staff in 1985 as a receptionist. She has a remarkable
talent for doing 3 things at the same time and remembering thousands of patients
by name. She has usually been the telephone voice of our office and does
an outstanding job under difficult circumstances. She is very dedicated to
us and our patients. Hendrietta is now our office manager.
<P>
<P>Jesse joined our staff in 1987 as a back office nurse. She is a licensed
vocational nurse. Jessie can also do 3 things at the same time and is a very
dedicated employee. She has developed many skills since joining us. She draws
blood, takes x-rays, does EKGs, gives injections, takes vital signs, puts
on casts and bandages.
<P>
<P>In 1987 we changed our name to Kind Care Medical Center and developed
our current logo with a cross and a heart.
<P>
<P>In the last year we have developed an exciting new specialty in weight
control and preventive medicine. This program has succeeded far beyond our
expectations. Of course we still practice general medicine also. We have
had to seek additional help. Karin's mother Mrs. Derks has joined us to answer
the telephone and assist in making appointments. She has become very proficient
in explaining our program to new patients who call on the phone. She is starting
to learn to work on the computer also. This is especially remarkable because
she is paralysed from the neck down and has only limited use of her hands.
She is an RN and has worked for years at LA County USC Medical Center and
at Arcadia Methodist Hospital.
<P>
<P>Karin's sister Ingrid has also joined our staff part time. She is also
an RN and works full time at San Antonio Hospital. She helps us monitor the
medical status of our patients and is very effective at coaching our patients
to healther lifestyles.
<P>
<P>Our four children help us out at the office frequently by filing and doing
small jobs. They are Daniel (13), Erin (11), Justin (10), and Brenton
(9).

is diagnosed if the reading is above this level on more than one occasion.
<P>We treat high blood pressure to prevent the development of its complications.
These are strokes, heart attacks, heart and kidney failure. It usually requires
continuoud lifelong therapy. A patient with high blood pressure can not tell
it it is high by the way he or she feels. Most patients with high blood pressure
are completely asymptomatic.
<P>The treatment of high blood pressure is very effective in preventing its
complications. If you have not had your blood pressure checked lately, come

<TITLE>High Cholesterol</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY><P>Desirable blood cholesterol level is below 200. Borderline
is from 200 to 239. Cholesterol levels of over 240 are considered to be high.
The number 240 was chosen as the cutoff point because at this level and above,
the risk of heart attack rises steeply.
<P>If the total cholesterol is found to be borderline or high, then the LDL
(bad cholesterol) and the HDL (good cholesterol) chould be measured. You
want the LDL to be below 130 and the HDL to be above 40.
<P>The first approach to the treatment of high cholesterol is a low fat diet.
Information on this type of diet is available for free in our office. If
diet alone is unable to control the cholesterol then we must use drug therapy
also. There are many effective medications for lowering cholesterol now
available. Some of these have now been shown to actually reduce the clogging
of arteries with cholesterol plaque called atherosclerosis.

<TITLE>Melanoma</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY><P>Skin cancer is the most common type of cancer. There are
several types of which the melanoma is by far the worst. Melanoma is often
found in young and middle aged adults and it can be deadly if not removed
early. It is becomming more common every year. It is most common in white
people.
<P>Some risk factors are:
<P>1. Family history of malignant melanoma.
<P>2. Blond or red hair.
<P>3. Marked freckling of the upper back.
<P>4. History of blistering sunburns as a child.
<P>5. History of working outdoors for three or more years as a teenager.
<P>What does it look like:
<P>A. Asymmetry- one half of the lesion does not look like the other half.
<P>B. Border irregularity- The edges of the mole are not sharp.
<P>C. Color varied- The lesion has more than one color. Tan, brown, black,
and sometimes red, white, or blue.

<TITLE>Acne</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY><P>Acne is a disease of the sebaceous glands of the skin. It
usually affects teenagers starting at the age of puberty. The face and upper
back are the locations most often involved. There are a variety of treatments
that are effective. Often antibiotics are used, either orally or applied
to the skin. Other treatment involves medication that opens the pores so
the glands drain better. For the most severe cases a medication called accutane
is very effective.

You are using 
<A
HREF="file://localhost/usr/opt/www/httpd/htdocs/docs/d2-concepts.html">
World Wide Web</A>
pages from a U. S. Geological Survey
site.  The behavior of your screen depends on the particular program
you are using to access these pages.  Get assistance from your local
WWW experts if you need help with that program.  Many programs have
help built into them which can be displayed by clicking on a help menu
selection with a mouse or perhaps entering "h" from the keyboard.<P>

In general, WWW documents have text and images, some of which are
references, or links, to other locations in the same document, or
to other documents.  These references are usually indicated by
underlining the text and/or making it a different color, or displaying
it in reverse video.  

It's important to realize that the references can point to documents
that are on the local computer or on a remote computer, and references in any
one document can point to many different computers.<P>

The method used to select a reference depends on the viewer program and
the kind of hardware you are using.  Commonly, if a mouse is available,
clicking on the reference will display it.  If a mouse is not
available, moving the screen cursor to the reference with arrow or tab
keys and then pressing the <Enter> key may display the new reference,
but, again, readers differ.<P>

WATER RESOURCES DIVISION - The mission of the Water Resources Division,
which supports the overall mission of the U.S. Department of the
Interior and the U.S. Geological Survey, is to provide the hydrologic
information and understanding needed for the best use and management of
the Nation's water resources for the benefit of the people of the
United States. To accomplish its mission, the Water Resources Division
in cooperation with State and local  governments and other Federal
agencies:

<UL>

<LI>Systematically collects data needed for the continuing
determination and evaluation of the quantity, quality, and use of the
Nation's water resources.

<LI>Conducts analytical and interpretive water-resources appraisals to
describe the occurrence, availability, and physical, chemical, and
biological characteristics of surface and ground water and their
inter-relationship.

<LI>Conducts supportive basic and problem-oriented research in
hydraulics, hydrology, and related fields of science and engineering to
improve the basis for field investigations and measurement techniques
and to understand hydrologic systems sufficiently well to predict
quantitatively their response to stress, either natural or manmade.

<LI>Disseminates water data and the results of investigations and
research through reports, maps, computerized information services, and
other forms of public releases.

<LI>Coordinates the activities of Federal agencies in the acquisition
of certain water information.

<LI>Provides scientific and technical assistance in hydrologic fields
to State, local, and other Federal agencies, to licensees of the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and, on behalf of the U.S.
Department of State, to international agencies.

<LI>Acquires, develops, and disseminates information on water-related
natural hazards such as droughts, floods, landslides, land subsidence,
mudflows, and volcanoes.

<LI>Administers the provisions of the Water Resources Research Act of
1984, which include the State Water Resources Research Institutes and
the Research Grants programs.

<LI>Supports the provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act of
1969 and manages Geological Survey conduct of natural-resources surveys
in response to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation,
and Liability Act (Superfund Act) of 1980.

<b>In the Ideal Clinic, Doctors Prevent Illness, Detoxify the Patient, and Bolster the Immune System</b>
<p>

For the last year in the Digest, we've been reporting on what we call the Ideal Clinic. A reader recently asked me to explain what I mean by this. To us, the ideal clinic means a medical office that best embodies the principles, practices, and systems of alternative medicine.<p> 
At an ideal clinic, we see numerous practitioners from different specialities applying compatible and interactive modalities to address the root cause underlying all the symptoms in an individual and taking steps to prevent illness in the future. The ideal clinic offers proven treatmentsbased on successful patient outcomesfor reversing major illnesses, including cancer, AIDS, and heart disease. The ideal clinic is really a sketch of what true health care ought to be and, with your help, what it eventually will be in North America.<p>
At the top of my list of criteria for the ideal clinic is the need for each practitioner to be a generalist. Whether you're an M.D., naturopath, homeopath, acupuncturist, chiropractor, or osteopath, it's crucial that you consider the whole person, from biochemistry to psyche, nutrient status to structural alignment. The age of the medical specialist is over; we can no longer practice a medicine of unconnected body parts. This is why conventional medicine usually fails to heal. In the new era of the medical generalist, practitioners see everything in a patient's symptom picture as connected and relevant; especially important is the vitality of the immune system, a fact conventional medicine inexcusably ignores.<p>
Three broad principles are at play in the ideal clinic. First, doctors see disease before it ever manifests as an organic disturbance. Examination by darkfield microscopy of a sample of the patient's living blood can reveal much about the health of or health threats confronting that person. By "reading" the patient's blood, the skilled physician can detect early signs of illness in the form of microorganisms known to produce disease. Specifically, darkfield microscopy reveals distortions of red blood cells, possible undesirable bacterial or fungal life forms, and blood ecology patterns indicative of health or illness.<p>
Ideal clinicians may rely on electrodermal screening (EDS) as a way of gathering energy information signals from the patient. A blunt, noninvasive electric probe is placed at specific points on the patient's  hands, face, or feet, corresponding to acupuncture points at the beginning or end of energy meridians. Minute electrical discharges from these points serve as information signals about the condition of the body's organs and systems, detecting allergies, infections, cancer processes, and immune deficiencies.<p>
EDS gives the physician valuable information about a patient's health problems at a very early stage. EDS also enables you to pinpoint hidden obstacles to treatment and to determine in advance which remedies at what strength and dosage are most likely to succeed.<p> 
In the ideal clinic, a patient's nutritional status is carefully evaluated, by means of blood tests and questionnaires. Categories to be checked include vitamins, minerals, amino acids, fatty and organic acids, lipid peroxides, general blood chemistries (cholesterol, thyroid hormone, glucose), and antioxidants. In each category, a patient's levels are compared with predetermined limits.<p> 
The practitioner must also find out the patient's level of toxicity. Unfortunately, no matter how healthfully they are living, almost everyone today has a variety of toxins (including parasites) in their body.<p> 
Increasingly, practitioners of alternative medicine find that low-level but chronic exposure to a variety of toxic heavy metals pose serious health dangers if the toxins are allowed to stay in the body. Such toxins are now commonly found in our food, water, and air, as well as cooking utensils, cosmetics, auto exhaust, tobacco smoke, many of the building materials and fabrics in our work and living environments, and dental materials in our teeth (specifically, mercury fillings).<p>
In the ideal clinic, a patient's teeth and dental history are accorded prime importance. Copious clinical research has established that mercury-based dental fillings, root canals, incompatible dental materials and metals, and jawbone infections (from previously extracted teeth) can pose serious health problems throughout the body. In many cases, unresolved or undetected dental problems are a key contributing cause to acute and chronic health problems and must be addressed for permanent relief of symptoms.<p>
As a practitioner in this ideal clinic, you must examine the patient's lifestyle for further contributing causes. Although it is more widely understood in Germany and China, geopathic factorsharmful energies emanating upwards from the Earth, usually into a housecan seriously compromise a person's health. For example,  underneath the house and directly aligned with a person's bed, there may be harmful electromagnetic field disturbances that can entirely undermine one's good health. Gamma rays from the atmosphere may also enter the ground and "feed" upwards into the house, creating ill health. In Germany, such places are called "cancer houses" because of the high incidence of cancer among people sleeping in beds positioned over such energy fields.<p> 
Another key aspect of lifestyle is how people feel and express themselves emotionally. Research clearly shows that emotional and psychological factorssuch as long-term unresolved trauma, resentment, anger, or griefcan set forces in motion that eventually result in physical illness. The ideal clinician must understand who the person is as well as what their problems are.<p>
The second principle in the ideal clinic is that practitioners emphasize detoxification of the patient. All the toxins in the body must come out. Chronic constipation comes with many health conditions and even supposed bowel regularity does not preclude the likelihood that your intestines may be clogged up like an overused all-purpose closet.<p>
If there is one thing that most alternative medicine doctors agree on, it is that too many toxins in the body produce illness. Many of these are stored in the small and large intestines as well as in key organs such as the liver and kidneys. Increasingly, a toxic body is being identified as the predisposing factor in a long list of acute and chronic, degenerative illnesses.<p> 
To flush the toxins from the body's "sewage system," the ideal clinician uses a variety of measures, including herbal detoxification formulas, colonics, coffee enemas, saunas, dietary changes, limited fasts, chelation, and "friendly" bacteria supplements such as Acidophilus. In addition, the physician addresses the patient's lymphatic system, using devices such as a light beam generator to free clogged lymph that, once moving again, helps collect and remove toxins from the body.<p>
Chelation therapy refers to a method of binding up ("chelating") toxins (e.g., heavy metals) and metabolic wastes and removing them from the body while at the same time increasing blood flow and removing arterial plaque. Chelation therapy is especially beneficial for preventing or reducing the effects of all forms of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease including angina pectoris and coronary artery disease.<p>
The third major principle exemplified by the ideal clinic is the fortification of the patient's immune system to prevent future illness. An efficient immune system is the key to lasting health. Once the toxins (and their burden on the immune system) have been removed from the body, an intelligent and strategic approach to eating and nutritional supplementation can ensure it will remain the efficient, dependable defense system the body requires.<p> 
The blood profiles and electrodermal screening results (mentioned above) can help identify the most appropriate and individualized nutritional and herbal supplementation program for the patient. Research shows that the physician's genuine caring, insightful attitude, and positive, optimistic outlook can also act as a valuable "health supplement." Ideal clinicians dispense these qualities liberally.<p> 
Finally, the ideal clinic itself is free of environmental contaminants and pollutants. A physician's office must be scrupulously designed and outfitted with environmentally-friendly materials so that it does not become yet another source of toxicity for clients. As one of our doctor's said in these pages, "The moment patients and staff walk through the door, the healing process begins."<p>

 <i>As supermodel, actress, and mother of 3, Kelly LeBrock knows how alternative medicine can help her take charge of her family's healthand she's on the road telling other mothers about it.</i><p>

 <b><tt>BY STEPHANIE MAROHN</tt></b><p>
</center>

<br>


Who would have guessed that the alluring Woman in Red of film fame or the star of the "Don't hate me because I'm beautiful" Proctor & Gamble shampoo commercials would become an impassioned crusader for alternative medicine?<p>
When she's not acting or modeling, Kelly LeBrock tours the country, extolling the benefits of homeopathy for children. She tells  audiences how and why she regularly uses alternative medicine to maintain her health and that of her 3 children. In effect, her new message is a rewrite of what made her famous, but with a twist"Don't hate me because I'm healthy."<p>
Kelly's commitment to health came out of a desire to find better medical solutions for her children. She had lost faith in antibiotics and the other drugs of conventional medicine. "We need to be taking more charge of ourselves and our children," she says. "True health should begin at home and not in the doctor's office."<p> 
Kelly knew if she wanted answers she'd have to find them herself. She did her homework and after extensive research found the solution in homeopathy. But she didn't stop with her family. To make it easier for other mothers struggling to find alternatives for treating their children's health, Kelly developedand now actively promotesa kit of simple but effective self-care homeopathic remedies for children. This is perhaps fitting for a woman who once thought of becoming a doctor.<p>

<b>HEALING HER DAUGHTER'S EAR INFECTIONS AT HOME</b><p>
Instead, Kelly became an internationally regarded model and then actress, appearing in The Woman in Red with Gene Wilder, Weird Science, and Hard to Kill, in which she costarred with her former husband, Steven Segal.<p> 
It was Segal who introduced her to alternative medicine. A regular user of acupuncture, Segal showed her the benefits firsthand in his own health and, when she tried it, she saw them in hers, too. Acupuncture and traditional Chinese herbs relieved the dizziness and fatigue she was experiencing from overwork. But it wasn't until Kelly had her first child that she began to rely on alternative medicine and use it as a mainstay in maintaining her family's health.<p> 
For her first few years, Kelly's daughter Anna Lisa suffered from the recurring ear infections so typical of childhood. "Like everybody else, I put her on antibiotics," says Kelly. "They didn't work, so I said, 'There has to be something else out there.'" That "something else" was homeopathy. The beauty of homeopathy is that it lends itself to both practitioner prescribing and low-dose self-care, depending on the condition involved.<p>
Kelly gave her daughter a homeopathic remedy and homemade ear drops (olive oil heated with fresh garlic). Kelly also put Anna Lisa on Acidophilus because she had learned that when there is an imbalance in the ear, it is generally due to an overgrowth of yeast in the intestines. A yeast overgrowth means there is probably a deficiency in "friendly" bacteria such as Acidophilus (necessary for intestinal health), so supplementation is prudent.<p>
Anna Lisa's ear infection cleared up quickly, she stopped getting ear infections, and her overall health and resistance improved. The experience filled Kelly with confidence in her ability to treat her children's health problems with homeopathy. When she had 2 more children, Kelly treated them also with homeopathic remedies from the start.<p> 
Today Dominic, 6, and Arissa, 3, are healthier than her firstborn, Anna Lisa, Kelly notes, which she attributes to the fact they have never had antibiotics. When any of her children start to come down with a cold, flu, fever, or sore throat, Kelly says she can usually reverse the symptoms in a day.<p> 
Recently, all the children in the local school were out sick, including Anna Lisa, now 9, who had swollen glands in her neck and a bad cold. Kelly treated her with low-dose homeopathics for one day and Anna Lisa was back in school the next, while all the other kids were still lying on their backs.<p> 
There are actually many homeopathic remedies suitable for colds, depending on the particular symptoms, but in Kelly's "Natural Medicine for Kids" kit the remedies blended together for cold symptoms are Apis Mellifica (from the common bee), Gelsemium Sempervirens (yellow jasmine), Kali Bichromicum (potassium bichromate), Pulsatilla (meadow anemone flower), and 6 others.<p>
Homeopathy also impressed Kelly in its ability to reduce fever. Arissa had a fever of 103.5F. "I gave her Belladonna and within 20 minutes her fever was down," reports Kelly. "I know if I had given her aspirin or Tylenol instead they would have shut down the mechanism of healing in her body. Homeopathics, in contrast, actually help to stimulate the immune system." Belladonna, from the plant of the same name, is well-indicated for sudden high temperatures (over 102F), intense thirst, and red hot face and lipsclassic fever symptoms.<p>
In the process of educating herself on health and medicine, Kelly got a political education as well. She began to see the politics behind the medicine. "The American Medical Asso-ciation and the FDA have a lot to answer for," she states. "Illness and death directly related to the use of conventional drugs should be considered one of the leading diseases in the U.S. Did you know that 28% of all hospital admissions are from drug-related illnesses?"<p> 
Kelly points out: "Many people die every year due to the toxicity from medications, yet I've never heard of anyone dying from taking a homeopathic remedy. Why is it that people only turn to alternative medicine after being told orthodox medicine can no longer help? By the time homeopaths get the patient, they have to act as 'cleaning agents' to undo all the damage pharmaceuticals have done."<p>
With views such as these, it's not surprising to learn that Kelly hasn't taken her children to a conventional doctor in years. "I'm not 'pooh-poohing' doctors," she says. "Doctors have done some phenomenal things, but I think parents need to be more responsible for their children's health," and in Kelly's view, that means doing as much self-care as you safely can.<p>
Kelly credits the long-term health of her own children to homeopathy and herbs, both of which, along with love and good food, are now a consistent part of their lives. "Health is about what you put in your body," says Kelly. "I don't buy anything that isn't organic, and I will not give farmers the money to keep buying pesticides. I want some kind of environment left for my children."<p>

<b>SHARING HER MEDICAL RESEARCH WITH FRIENDS</b><p>
There is a great deal more to alternative medicine than homeopathy and Kelly has delved deeply into other options for health. With an impressive avidity, Kelly has investigated many therapies on the progressive edge of alternative medicine, such as hyperbaric oxygen, chelation, colonics, and placenta and glandular extracts. She's also visited cancer clinics to learn their alternative approaches. While on site, Kelly talked to patients conventional medicine had given up on, yet whose tumors had disappeared or shrunk to a size that no longer caused them pain.<p> 
Her research enabled Kelly to help a friend find relief for his cancer at one such clinic. According to Kelly, thanks to the alternative therapies used, the 26 tumors in his right lung and 18 tumors in his left were reduced to only 1 and 2 respectively"basically through nutrition, diet, and herbs," says Kelly.<p>
She's seen similarly remarkable results with hyperbaric oxygen therapy. When a friend of the family became ill with a neurological disease that attacked her nervous system and left her a paraplegic within a year, the only treatment that worked was hyperbaric oxygen, or pure oxygen delivered to the body in a special pressurized chamber. She went from being wheelchair-bound to being able to walk after only 1 week of daily treatments in a hyperbaric oxygen chamber.<p> 
     True to her unflagging medical curiosity, Kelly tried the chamber herself. She wanted to see if she felt any different after saturating her body with oxygen. She did. "I felt energized, my skin was alive, I felt alive."<p> 
Kelly also discovered chelation therapy in her wide-ranging research. Unfortunately, relatives of hers died of heart attacks before she was able to persuade them to get chelation, which has proved effective in improving blood circulation by helping to remove toxins. For some, new therapies are a hard sell, even if it could restore their health, she admits.<p> 
"They're all so brainwashed into surgery," Kelly says. "When people are confronted with the fact they might die, they generally go with what everybody else has done. I just went through this with a friend of mine who is 70. He had 6 bypasses. He now has back the same pains that he had before he had the bypasses. If he'd done chelation, he'd be jumping around instead."<p>
To her credit, Kelly's mother was one who did act on the health information Kelly offered her. She had had numerous surgeries over the years, including the removal of her gallbladder, and was not doing well; she was prediabetic and subject to blackouts. Kelly observes that her mother was a "very emotional person" and would be likely to respond well to homeopathy, which can balance the emotions and the body.<p> 
Through a  combination of  homeopathy, acupuncture, and Chinese herbs, Kelly's mother regained her health. That was 12 years ago and Kelly is convinced that, without these treatments, her mother would be dead by now. "She's another personshe's healthy," says Kelly.<p>
When it comes to her own health, Kelly gladly tries new approaches that her research indicates are sound. When she developed a thyroid problem, Kelly traveled to a clinic in Switzerland that specialized in treatment with bovine or sheep placenta and glandular extracts. Her treatment consisted of injections of thymus extract derived from sheep to stimulate her underfunctioning thyroid combined with the placental extract which is regarded by some as a youth serum. The approach got her thyroid back into balance.<p>
Colonics and intestinal cleansing is another topic well-researched by Kelly. "I'm a great believer in colonics," she says. "People clean their house and cars and try to 'clean' their minds, but not their bodies. A lot of disease comes from having an unclean colon. If you keep your colon empty and clean, you keep your body clean."<p> 

<b>CREATING A HEALTHY FUTURE FOR OUR CHILDREN</b><p>
"Health is an ongoing process, a way of life," says Kelly. She stresses the importance of caring for the mind as well as the body and advocates "taking time for yourself, to go for walks, to try and find peace in the day." For Kelly, this is often a walk in the woods on her remote ranch in the Santa Ynez Valley in Southern California.<p>
But when she leaves her ranch for her many speaking engagements, Kelly feels she is on a mission to spread the word to other mothers. There is a safe, inexpensive, and effective alternative to conventional medicine, she tells them, and that is homeopathy. Kelly worked closely with Boiron, a major manufacturer of homeopathic remedies, based in France, to develop a kit of 6 useful formulas. Kelly says she donates a portion of the profits to charity and insists that getting across the message of self-care with homeopathy is the reason she's doing all this.<p>
"It's not about making money. It's about opening the minds of mothers," she says. Getting mothers to feel comfortable about taking more charge of their children's health with nontoxic homeopathic remedies could be an important step in creating that healthy future for our children, she says.<p> 
To make things easy and comfortable for mothers, the 6 formulas in Kelly's "Natural Medicine for Kids" address common childhood ailments such as teething, fever, cold symptoms, sleeplessness, motion sickness, and bumps and bruises. As with most homeopathic remedies, the formulas come in the form of essentially tasteless little white pills in a plastic dispenser. But don't be deceived by the unassuming nature of the remedies: just a few pills will usually do the job.<p>
Kelly notes that she hears from a lot of mothers that they sometimes feel distrustful of homeopathy because they can buy it so easily over the counter. It's as if they can't believe something this easy to get can be effective. "They think if you can't get it from your doctor there must be something wrong with it. Yet homeopathy is FDA-approved. I really am passionate because I have been in their placethat of mothers not knowing and not understanding."<p>
On the whole, Kelly finds that people are more open to alternative medicine now than they were when she first began her research about 10 years ago. "They're more open because they're fed up," she says. "They're fed up with dealing with all the side effects and not feeling better." Her hope is that people will follow her example and educate themselves about the alternatives so they can "take charge of their own health and that of their children."<p>

 <i>An underactive thyroid gland may be the reason your chronic health problems aren't getting any better.</i><p>
 <tt>BY STEPHEN E. LANGER, M.D.</tt><p>
</center>

<br>

There's a hidden reason why weight problems, muscle pain, chronic fatigue, depression, and other conditions don't respond to treatment. It's called the thyroid gland. Located in the neck, it's the largest of the body's 9 endocrine glands, and its role in all aspects of healthy body functioning is paramount. Yet it is also probably the most overlooked factor in a great many health problems, from chronic fatigue to obesity, depression to skin problems.<p> 
In fact, in the 1940s, Broda O. Barnes, M.D., Ph.D., a pioneer in thyroid research and the author of 100 medical articles on this gland, made a remarkable statement that is still not sufficiently heeded today. Dr. Barnes said that untreated problems with the thyroid gland represent the underlying condition responsible for 64 common medical ailments suffered by about 40% of the population. With the increasing prevalance of chronic and degenerative illness today, perhaps it is time to pay more attention to Dr. Barnes' conclusions.<p>
Since I began medical practice in 1967, probably the single most important element in my approach has been attention to the thyroid gland and 2 hormones it secretes. The thyroid controls how fast energy is burned in every cell, a process called metabolic activity. The healthy functioning of the thyroid is central to everything else in the body and, as Dr. Barnes said, problems here can contribute to numerous medical conditions.<p> 
Yet the "cure" is surprisingly simple: nothing has so low a toxicity level and is as easy and inexpensive to use as thyroid hormone, correctly administered by a physician. There is much more room for therapeutic intervention with thyroid-based health conditions than with other glandular problems because, while the thyroid is central to so many body functions, hormonal adjustments can be made with minimal disturbance of the overall system.<p>

<br><b>THE WHOLE BODY BECOMES UNDERACTIVE</b><p>
The list of thyroid-related health problems is long and disturbing. It includes many chronic fatigue cases, the inability to lose weight, anemia unrelieved by iron supplementation, feeling cold in the extremities even in warm climates, lethargy, concentration and memory problems, mental sluggishness, depression, skin problems (eczema, dry, scaly, or coarse skin, acne), swelling and fluid retention, constipation, hair loss, menstruation problems (especially heavy bleeding), extreme sleepiness, slowed heart rate, diminished sexual interest and ability, chronic muscle pain and weakness, and a higher susceptibility to infectious diseases.<p>
When the thyroid is underactive, everything in the body gradually becomes hypoactive as well, from circulation to libido. But here's the problem: It's my estimation that a large number of clinically severe thyroid conditions go undetected for long periods of time and some, regrettably, are never picked up. <p>
Along with this, people are often erroneously treated for chronic health conditions that are really based on the thyroid and that would respond well and quickly to a small dose of thyroid hormone. <p>
For example, take skin problems. One of the first things the body does when the thyroid is underactive is reduce the blood supply to the skin to conserve energy. As a result, such a person will perspire less, bacteria can flourish on the skin, and acne lesions can develop. If you aggressively treat the acne and ignore the thyroid, you won't see much permanent change.<p>
As another example, consider depression. I treated a patient who had been depressed for 60 years; yet when he took thyroid hormone, his depression was gone within a month. Whatever his previous physicians prescribed focused on his depression but missed the underlying thyroid cause, so he was miserable for most of his lifetime. <p>
Incidentally, although medical research and statistics suggest that an underactive thyroid is more common in women, I contend there is as much underactive thyroid and thyroiditis (inflamed thyroid) in men as in women.<p>

<br><b>REVERSING 10 YEARS OF HYPOTHYROIDISM</b><p>
When Frank, aged 47, first walked into my office, he had near total body failure and was almost permanently bedridden. He had chronic fatigue, intermittent headaches, light sensitivity, multiple chemical sensitivities, heart palpitations, mood swings, and anxiety fluctuating with depression. Frank was cold all the time, his appetite was poor, his mental abilities were sluggish, and he'd been sick for most of the previous 10 years. He was on prescription antidepressants.<p>
I ordered standard laboratory tests for Frank's thyroid function, to evaluate the status of T3, T4, TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone), and FTI (free thyroxine index, to see how much thyroxine was actually active). Some physicians only look at T4 levels. Taken alone, this is useless. TSH is the most sensitive indicator of thyroid function. The whole thyroid panel should be run. Of the 4, Frank's TSH levels were highly elevated; the normal range is 0.35 to 5.5, but his was 10.6. Any elevation of TSH means the thyroid gland is failing functionally. <p>
Frank started taking a quarter of a grain daily of natural thyroid hormone derived from animals. Over the next 3 months, I gradually increased the dosage to almost 2 grains per day. My preference was to run a series of allergy sensitivity tests but Frank's budget didn't allow for this. As a way of working around this, he began a low-fat diet that was high in complex carbohydrates and low in "glycemic" foods, which means foods whose carbohydrate (or simple sugar) composition is absorbed too rapidly into the bloodstream. <p>
Frank tracked his diet to see which foods provoked problems, and identified wheat, corn, and dairy as allergenic foods to be eliminated. He took a high-potency multiple mineral/vitamin supplement and about 1000 mg total of the essential fatty acids omega-3 and omega-6. These were in the form of gamma linolenic acid (GLA) from borage oil (240 mg, twice daily) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 240 mg, twice daily). <p>
Frank also took daily doses of Ester C, a form of vitamin C (500 mg), calcium (125 mg), and magnesium (65 mg). I also increased his dietary protein intake so that more amino acids (the building blocks of proteins) would be available to his brain where they could help offset the biochemical side of his depression.<p>
Over the 3 months on the thyroid hormone, Frank's condition steadily improved. Stamina, energy, digestion, muscular function, moodeverything got better. All of his systems had been operating at suboptimal levels; restoring the correct level of thyroid hormone was like stoking the flames in all his cells. <p>
Frank was a classic "basket case" before taking the thyroid hormone, but now he is a functional human being, doing a world better than he was before. He's able to fend for himself, prepare his own meals, and exercise regularly without being drugged to the eyeballs on conventional medications which gave him practically every side effect possible. In fact, Frank's mental processes improved so much with the thyroid hormone, that he was able to stop taking all his prescription drugs. <p>


<br><b>ENDING 3 YEARS OF PAINFUL THYROIDITIS</b><p>
A second major health problem relating to an underactive thyroid is called Hashimoto's autoimmune thyroid-itis, known as HAIT or, simply, thyroiditis. Here the thyroid gland is enlarged, usually without pain. However, the autoimmune factor is involved because the body releases antibodies against its own thyroid as if it were a foreign object in the body. HAIT seems to run in families, with most patients being between the ages of 13 and 40.<p>
Typical symptoms include fatigue, memory loss, depression, and a sense of nervousness that can range from mild anxiety to serious panic attack. You can also have allergies, irregular heartbeat or palpitations, muscle and joint pain, sleep disturbances in which you wake up with your mind racing and heart beating fast, reduced sexual interest, menstrual irregularities, headaches, digestive disorders, and intestinal problems from diarrhea to constipation. Also, you are likely to have the sensation of a lump in your throat; this is actually your inflamed, slightly swollen thyroid gland.<p>
When I am confronted with this symptom picture, I routinely have the patient's thyroid antibodies checked. For example, a person's thyroid hormone levels (such as T4) may be normal but their thyroid antibodies are elevated. Many physicians miss this; in my opinion, thyroid antibody tests should be run routinely on anyone with a chronic health problem. If a patient has a low elevation of thyroid antibodies, I will start this person on a low dose of thyroid hormone even if their thyroid hormone levels are supposedly normal. Let me explain this by presenting a case.<p>
Theodora, aged 43, came to me with multiple symptoms. She had chronic joint and muscle pain and fatigue, numerous infections, frequent sore throats, and was always on the verge of having a cold. She had intermittent heart palpitations, irregular periods, intestinal gas, indigestion, constipation, and diarrhea. She had pain in seemingly every muscle in her body, plus headaches, insomnia, and nasal congestion. While her thyroid hormone levels were normal, her level of thyroid antibodies was sky-high.<p>
I started her on a low dose of thyroid hormone, at a quarter of a grain per day, then gradually increased this to 3 grains over the next year. A lab test indicated she was deficient in 3 amino acids, vitamin B5, inositol, and zinc. Rather than prescribing amino acid supplements, I had her increase her dietary protein intake. To address the other deficiencies., I started Theodora on a high-potency multiple vitamin/mineral.  <p>
People with thyroid problems tend to have sluggish intestines. Another test indicated that Theodora had an elevated Candida albicans yeast infection in her intestines. To address this, Theodora started a high complex carbohydrate diet and avoided refined sugars, sweets, and fruits; she began rotating her foods so that her system was not constantly having to process the same foods. Through food allergy testing, I determined that Theodora was sensitive to a long list of foods, including kidney beans, rye grain, cheddar cheese, egg yolk, wheat, almonds, figs, kale, and others.<p>
I also gave her grapefruit seed extract (500 mg, 3 times daily) to help detoxify her intestines; Acidophilus capsules (2 capsules, 3 times daily) to recolonize her intestines with the appropriate "friendly" bacteria;  Aquaflora, a homeopathic remedy for yeast infections (taken once daily for 30 days); and high-potency garlic (1 tablet, twice daily).<p>
After about 6 months on this program, many of Theodora's symptoms were much reduced, and after a total of 12 months, she was about 75% improved. Her muscle pains were greatly diminished, her energy level was much better, all signs of flu and cold were gone, she was able to exercise comfortably, and all her digestive processes were practically normal.  <p>
My HAIT patients often ask me if they must remain on thyroid hormone indefinitely. I have been able to wean many of my HAIT patients from a thyroid supplement in a relatively short timewithin 3-6 monthsby bolstering their immune system nutritionally. <p>

 <i>Watch your high blood pressure drop to normal when you change your diet, take coenzyme Q10, exercise, and release buried emotions, says cardiologist Stephen Sinatra, M.D.</i><p>
</center>

When it comes to heart disease, prevention is easier than cure, says cardiologist Stephen T. Sinatra, M.D., executive director of the New England Heart Center in Man-chester, Connecticut. Based on 20 years of experience as a board-certified cardiologist, Dr. Sinatra strongly believes that "if you do have heart disease, you can slow its progression and even reverse it." One of the best places to start is to reduce high blood pressure, a major risk factor for cardiovascular illness, says Dr. Sinatra. It may be major, but it's also controllable, using natural nondrug approaches, he adds.<p>
To accomplish this, Dr. Sinatra offers a comprehensive alternative program of dietary change, nutritional supplements, exercise, and psychological counseling, in addition to some conventional prescription of beta blockers and other "antihypertensive" drugs. Dr. Sinatra's approach addresses the mind and body, the physiology and emotions, of the individual with high blood pressure.<p>
"There is definitely a heart/brain 'hotline,'" he notes in his new book Heartbreak & Heart Disease. "The identification of people at risk for sudden death depends not only on the hidden possibilities of heart disease, but also on the psychological and emotional status of the one afflicted." To appreciate his approach, we must first understand certain heart basics.<p>
<b>THE HEART UNDER PRESSURE</b><p>
In the U.S., high blood pressure, or hypertension, accounts for an estimated 28.3 million annual office visits to conventional physicians, or about 7.2% of all doctors' appointments in a year. This amount is twice that for acute upper respiratory infection, the next most prevalent health condition on a list of the top 10, according to data compiled by Scott-Levin's Physician Drug and Diagnosis Audit in 1996. <p>
High blood pressure, in fact, is regarded as the most common of all cardiovascular diseases in industrialized nations and is a major cause of heart attack, stroke, and congestive heart failure. In the U.S., an estimated 50 million adults suffer from hypertension, including more than 50% of those over age 60, and 64% of those over 70.<p>
To understand high blood pressure, you need to know a few facts about the heart. The human heart beats on average 70 times per minute, 100,000 times a day, and 2.5 billion times in a lifetime. With each heart beat, about 2.5 ounces of blood are pumped through the heart-that is 1,980 gallons every day. <p>
The term blood pressure refers to the force of the blood against the walls of arteries, veins, and the chambers of the heart as it is pumped through the body. The additional force exerted by the blood against the arteries (when high blood pressure is present) begins to weaken the cellular walls and makes it easier for harmful substances, such as toxins and cholesterol, to form dangerous deposits on the arterial walls.<p>
Blood pressure measurement involves 2 key numbers: systolic (when the heart contracts) and diastolic (when the heart rests and fills with more blood). The ratio of the 2 represents blood pressure, as in 120/85, an "average" or healthy reading. A typical reading indicative of early high blood pressure is 140/90.<p>
<b>COENZYME Q10: <br>
AN ENERGY NUTRIENT FOR THE HEART</b><p>
Pamela, aged 47, came to Dr. Sinatra with a seriously high blood pressure of 205/105. About 2 years earlier, physicians had placed her on standard antihypertensive drugs, such as beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, and ACE inhibitors. These had left her excessively fatigued, coughing, and dissatisfied with the results. <p>
Dr. Sinatra immediately started Pamela on coenzyme Q10, at a dosage of 30 mg, 3 times daily; at the same time he reduced her intake of high blood pressure drugs by half. CoQ10, a substance found naturally in sardines, salmon, mackerel, and beef heart (but not made by the human body) is an essential feature of Dr. Sinatra's program because it helps prevent the depletion of substances that recharge the cellular energy system in the body. 	<p>
"As the heart muscle continually uses oxygen and consumes huge amounts of energy, heart muscle cells can greatly benefit from the energy boost of coenzyme Q10," says Dr. Sinatra. In fact, levels of coQ10 are usually 10 times higher in the healthy heart than in any other organ. This is why a coQ10 deficiency is most likely to primarily affect the heart and contribute to heart failure. It is estimated that 39% of patients with high blood pressure have a coQ10 deficiency. <p>
The heart requires a constant supply of coQ10 to meet its energy needs. It is both "extremely vulnerable to nutritional deficiencies" and highly receptive to the benefits of "targeted nutrition," Dr. Sinatra says. Clinical research indicates it usually takes 4-12 weeks for coQ10 to have a noticeable effect on blood pressure.<p>
"I regard coQ10 as one of the best medical discoveries of the 20th century," he states. "I've been using it for 10 years and have probably thousands of patients on it now. It is absolutely essential for strengthening the biochemistry of the heart cells." CoQ10 functions like a vitamin, "rescuing" body tissues that have been damaged by free radicals. "CoQ10 taken for cardiovascular conditions may enable some patients to reduce the dosage of their medications by up to 50%," notes Dr. Sinatra.<p>
For these reasons, Dr. Sinatra starts almost all his cardiovascular patients on coQ10 at the initial low dose of 90 mg daily, then gradually increases it. "Extemely few people are oversensitive to it and may experience nausea-very rarely do I see side effects," says Dr. Sinatra. After 1 week, he increased Pamela's coQ10 dosage to 60 mg, 3 times daily.<p>
The standard dose for coQ10, as commonly prescribed by physicians, is "sub-therapeutic" and probably too low to be effective, says Dr. Sinatra. If you take 90-120 mg daily, you're likely to have a blood level of 1.5 ug/ml of usable coQ10, while what the body requires for a strong therapeutic response is 2.5 to 3.5 ug/ml. <p>
As a general heart-protective dose, Dr. Sinatra himself takes 180 mg daily, but for high blood pressure, he usually builds toward a daily dose of 180-360 mg, and for serious congestive heart failure, 360-400 mg daily. For preventive maintenance for someone without a specific heart problem, Dr. Sinatra recommends a dosage of 30-90 mg daily.<p>
<b>THE VALUE OF A MEDITERRANEAN DIET</b><p>
Dr. Sinatra also recommended that Pamela institute major changes in her diet. Specifically, he said her diet should consist of 30% fats, 20-25% protein, and 45-50% carbohydrates. The fats should come from fish such as salmon, mackerel, Greenland halibut, cod, and blue fish, but not tuna because of possible mercury contamination. Large amounts of red meat should be avoided while fresh fruits and vegetables are emphasized. Dr. Sinatra calls this the traditional Mediterranean diet. <p>
A now classic study conducted in the 1980s investigating the rate of heart attacks over a 10-year period for individuals in European nations revealed that the island of Crete reported zero heart attacks as a cause of death, even though many of the residents had dangerously high cholesterol levels, a presumed risk factor for heart disease. <p>
According to Dr. Sinatra, "the Mediterranean diet, rich in monounsaturated fat (olive oil) and antioxidants, has proved to be crucial in cardiovascular protection." Dr. Sinatra says this diet is low in saturated fats (such as dairy products and meats), high in fiber and antioxidants (from fresh fruits and vegetables) such as vitamin C, beta carotene, and vitamin E, and high in essential fatty acids, found in flax and other omega-3 oils. <p>
Avocadoes and asparagus, commonly eaten in this diet, are rich in L-glutathione, an amino acid that can scavenge harmful free radicals, while garlic and onions have ingredients that help protect the heart, and olive oil is "the healthiest of oils, no doubt."<p>
Underlying the success of the Mediterranean diet is a biochemical principle, Dr. Sinatra says. It is called insulin resistance or hyperinsulinism. Insulin is a key digestive hormone, secreted by the pancreas for regulating the absorption of glucose (blood sugar) and the metabolism of carbohydrates and fats. In general, most Americans are eating too many carbohydrates which in turn leads to excess insulin secretion (hyperinsulinism) and to insulin resistance, says Dr. Sinatra.<p>
"When you've had too much insulin circulating in your bloodstream for too long-as is often the case when people doggedly stick to high-carbohydrate, low-fat diets-specialized receptor cells lose their ability to respond to insulin." The resulting insulin resistance can lead to higher blood pressure, thickened, less elastic arterial walls, increased cravings for carbohydrates, and higher blood sugar levels, says Dr. Sinatra.  <p>
This factor contributes to heart disease in 2 ways. First, as insulin secretion increases, so does the level of arachidonic acid; further biochemical changes resulting from this cause blood vessels to constrict and blood to clot, and this sets up a risk factor for both higher blood pressure and serious heart problems. <p>
The second problem with too much insulin is that it is antagonistic to the cells (called endothelial) that line the blood vessels and keep them free of obstructions, Dr. Sinatra says. As insulin levels rise, the structural integrity of the endothelial cells suffers and the type of muscles in the blood vessels changes. The result can be blood vessels that are prone to developing plaque deposits, which again can lead to high blood pressure, he adds.<p>
"The benefit of the Mediterranean diet is that everything in it helps prevent excess insulin release," says Dr. Sinatra. The diet, through saltwater fish, shellfish, and flaxseed, contains high levels of alpha-linolenic and omega-3 fatty acids, which are "the most important essential fatty acids for the protection of cardiovascular health." <p>
Dr. Sinatra also generally recommends minimizing the consumption of "high glycemic carbohydrates." This means foods such as flour pastas, white potatoes, and white rice, whose carbohydrate portion enters the bloodstream quickly, leading to higher levels of  insulin to handle the sudden glucose load. Examples of fruits with a low-glycemic index (slow absorption by the blood) include grapefruit, cherries, peaches, plums, kiwi, and rhubarb. Pamela was also instructed to avoid preservatives, processed foods and meats, canned vegetables, diet soft drinks, and chemical ingredients.<p>
Under Dr. Sinatra's supervision, Pamela added tofu, navy beans, and seaweeds to her diet for their magnesium content. She also started taking an antioxidant vitamin-mineral formula (containing no copper or iron) developed by Dr. Sinatra under the brand name Optimum Health. <p>
Pamela started taking a daily formula containing 1000 mg calcium and 500 mg magnesium. These amounts were in addition to the vitamin-mineral supplement which contained lower amounts of both (280 mg of magnesium, 250 mg of calcium). "Magnesium prevents spasming of blood vessels which is why it's one of the most important mineral treatments for high blood pressure," says Dr. Sinatra.<p>
Dr. Sinatra also encouraged Pamela to begin a regular exercise program, preferably vigorous walking. "I don't recommend jogging. If you can do a brisk walk lasting 15 minutes twice a day, that's all the exercise you really need," says Dr. Sinatra. As an alternative, he advises dancing (and practices it himself) as a "heart nurturing" form of daily rhythmic exercise. Regularity, not intensity, of exercise is paramount, he says.<p>
At Pamela's next appointment 2 weeks later, her blood pressure had dropped to 170/90, "a big improvement," says Dr. Sinatra. He kept her on the diet and supplement program, including coQ10 at 180 mg daily; he took her off calcium channel blocker but kept her on a low dose of beta blocker. She maintained a daily walking program of 1-2 miles. After about 3 months on the Sinatra program, Pamela's blood pressure had come down to a safe 140-145/80-85. "I was satisfied with that," Dr. Sinatra says.<p>
<b>HAWTHORN HELPS COLIN'S HEART RELAX</b><p>
Dr. Sinatra offers another case involving Colin, aged 65, who came to him with a history of heart attacks and progressive heart failure. His problem was that his heart's pumping ability was severely reduced. Colin's blood pressure was 180/90, he was unable to tolerate most conventional heart drugs, and his mitral valve (one of the heart's 4 valves) was leaking blood as a result of his high blood pressure. Colin had chronic shortness of breath and was unable to walk much without getting winded.<p>
Dr. Sinatra started Colin on the Mediterranean diet, coQ10, magnesium, calcium, and potassium supplements, and hawthorn herbal extract (from hawthorn berries) beginning at 500 mg daily, then increasing to 1000 mg. Clinical studies have shown that hawthorn can help reduce blood pressure by reducing or blocking the constriction of blood vessels directly serving the heart. This is crucial because when blood vessels constrict, blood pressure rises. "I gave Colin hawthorn to reduce his blood pressure, strengthen his heart, and give him a good quality of life," which means improved health without the unpleasant side effects of drugs.<p>
Colin also began taking B vitamins, specifically 40 mg each of B1, B2, and B6, 40 mcg of B12, and 800 mcg of folic acid. "I recommend B vitamins for anybody with heart disease because they are the antidote to a condition we call hyperhomocysteinemia," says Dr. Sinatra. <p>
Here is how it works: Red meat contains methionine, an essential amino acid and protein building block. But if your system is deficient in B vitamins, methionine does not get broken down into simpler substances and instead forms homocysteine. Too much homocysteine contributes to premature heart disease and aging, explains Dr. Sinatra. <p>
After about 6 weeks on the program, Colin's blood pressure dropped to 140-145/90-95. There was less leakage at his mitral valve; he was not taking any conventional drugs; he was able to walk, play golf, and exercise more freely; and "he felt he was in terrific control of his life," says Dr. Sinatra.<p>
Often an individual with high blood pressure or heart disease suffers from depression and sexual dysfunction including impotence, Dr. Sinatra notes. Sometimes these conditions are caused by conventional drugs; other times, they result from diminished nutrition and unresolved emotional issues. To help shift the depression that can accompany heart problems, Dr. Sinatra prescribes the amino acid L-tyrosine. Getting a person off conventional heart drugs and onto a solid nutritional support program often completes the turnaround, he adds.<p>
"When you empower patients with nutritional support, diet, and exercise, they have control over their destiny and develop a much greater optimism. When you have this optimism about participating in your health, you become alive sexually. I've seen this many times. I tell them I am not their doctor but their nurse. In other words, I will nurse them along and nurture their healing, but they have the power to get well."<p>
<b>UNCOVERING THE ANGER IN RAY'S BLOOD PRESSURE</b><p>
It's important not to overlook the crucial role that emotions can play in the development of high blood pressure, notes Dr. Sinatra. "The psychological risk factors can be just as lethal as the more accepted physical risk factors," he says. Unresolved emotions, such as anger, hostility, and rage, and the way one reacts to stress are hidden risk factors in heart disease that many cardiologists fail to acknowledge. <p>
To many, both physicians and patients, these emotions represent the "dark side" or shadow portion of the personality that tends to get denied or suppressed. "But I think that getting in touch with these powerful hidden emotions and becoming aware of their contribution to heart disease is critical to healing and protecting the heart," Dr. Sinatra says. Ray's case perfectly demonstrates this point.<p>
Ray, aged 44, was a corporate  executive in a position of high responsibility and stress. His blood pressure was "horrendous" at 220/115 and was not responding at all to conventional antihypertensive drugs when he first came for treatment. Dr. Sinatra performed an emotional stress test on Ray, using a computerized device called a Cardiac Performance Laboratory (CPL) that in effect measures anger by evaluating the degree to which the blood vessels are constricted from hypertension. The CPL measures 17 dynamic circulatory changes inside the heart and blood vessels.<p>
Dr. Sinatra asked Ray to perform mental arithmetic, put his hands in ice cold water, and answer stressful questions. The test registers the changes in blood pressure literally with each heartbeat in accordance with these requests. If you are a reasonably calm person, putting your hands in ice water will elevate your blood pressure 5-10 points, says Dr. Sinatra, but if you are what is called a "hot reactor" or physiological over-reactor, the jump may be 30-40 points. <p>
"With Ray, I was dealing with a man who was very calm on the outside but on the inside, he was a hot reactor. When I asked him questions about his mother or his personal life, he virtually went off the walls with his blood pressure." He saw it rise dangerously to 240/125 under stress. "Ray was a young man but in tough shape-a risk for sudden death." <p>
During his interview with Ray, Dr. Sinatra observed how much anger Ray held in his body, as evidenced by his clenched jaw and shallow breathing. Dr. Sinatra then understood why the antihypertensive drugs were having no useful effect on Ray: his anger was the prime cause of his high blood pressure. <p>
"Are you aware of how much anger you have?" Dr. Sinatra asked him. Ray responded: "Yes, but I can't get it out or show it." He then admitted he had never shared this secret with anybody nor had he ever allowed himself to show his anger. "Then Ray started to cry because he was seeing this side of himself for the first time. Crying is very healthy for the heart. I try to reframe a patient's anger and make it a healing rather than a destructive energy."<p>
After this meeting, Ray started psychotherapy with a practitioner trained in the way emotions can be lodged in the body. Soon after, Ray's corporation transferred him to another city, but when Dr. Sinatra heard from him about 6 months later, Ray reported that his blood pressure was completely normal.<p>
Ray's case underscores another important insight gained from the heart study of the Cretans, particularly the men, says Dr. Sinatra. Equally as important as their Mediterranean diet is the fact that men in that region tend to talk more openly with other men about their feelings, families, dreams, and spiritual beliefs. <p>
Men in this Mediterranean culture tend not to wear social masks, but feel comfortable arguing, crying, supporting, even holding one another, says Dr. Sinatra. This quality of  comradery and the respect for the "healing powers of nurturing relationships" is a major factor accounting for the low level of coronary heart disease among that population, he says.<p>
Best of all-for his patients-Dr. Sinatra tries to be a good example of what is required to keep one's heart healthy and unpressured. He works hard but he listens to his body so he does not become highly stressed. He takes coQ10, practices the Mediterranean diet, and loves to dance. "I cry when I want to and have my anger-I experience my dark-side, shadow emotions." <p>
He never forgets that becoming ill, whether with high blood pressure or other heart ailments, "is really a form of disease that emerges from the chaotic imbalance of mind, body, and spirit." For a cardiovascular therapy to be completely successful, says Dr. Sinatra, it must heal this "disturbed relationship," addressing heart stress at the metabolic, physiological, psychological, and even spiritual levels.

 <b>Geronimo Rubio, M.D.</b><p>
 <blockquote>
  <i>Physicians at American Metabolic Institute use up to 150 different nontoxic medications and therapies to teach the immune system to eliminate cancer.</i><p>
 </blockquote>
</center>

<br>

To successfully reverse cancer, you must teach the patient's immune system how to respond effectively to the cancerous cells, says Geronimo Rubio, M.D, medical director of the American Metabolic Institute. This may sound obvious but when the body has a cancer process under way, clearly the immune system has become dysfunctional and is either unable or has forgotten how to eliminate the foreign cells.<p>
Dr. Rubio administers a 16-bed facility for treating cancer in La Mesa, Mexico, a few miles south of San Diego, California. Typically, patients stay for 3 to 5 weeks while they receive treatments from a diverse roster of alternative modalities, from enzymes to special vaccines, oxygen therapy to visualizations, physiotherapy to energy frequencies. Dr. Rubio draws upon 150 different medications in developing his individual treatment plans. American Metabolic's small inpatient population enables Dr. Rubio's staff to concentrate their medical attention on patients virtually around the clock.<p>
According to statistics compiled by American Metabolic Institute, based on their clinical work since its founding in 1983, their success rate in reversing stage III and IV cancers is 65% to 75%, but when they are able to work with cancers at an earlier phase of development, such as stages I and II, their reversal rate is about 80%, says Dr. Rubio. "If the patient follows the program, the patient's system will respond favorably to treatment," he adds.<p> 
<b>Blood Tests and Diet</b>. American Metabolic performs standard blood tests and CAT scan, MRI, and ultrasound evaluations of each patient as needed. Using a darkfield microscope, Dr. Rubio can examine a sample of the patient's live blood for signs of toxicity and immune dysfunction. A toxic liver, for example, will be indicated by dark specks amidst the living red blood cells under the microscope.<p>
Physicians at American Metabolic are particularly concerned with determining the patient's blood type. That is because the dietary program is coordinated with the patient's specific blood profile.<p> 
<b>Dietary Plan</b>. For example, a patient with type O blood needs to eat some meat regularly to build strong blood and may become anemic on a vegetarian diet, says Dr. Rubio. These patients are advised to eat organically raised chicken or shark at least 3 times weekly. A patient with type A or B blood does not require animal protein and may draw their protein from vegetable sources instead, such as grains and soybeans. "This is a more specific way of prescribing a diet and does not distress the patient with an inappropriate eating plan," Dr. Rubio explains.<p> 
<b>Fasting</b>. If the patient has enough energy reserves, they undergo a 3-day limited fast, consuming only fresh vegetable juices, in order to cleanse the body. On day 4, the patient has vegetable broth; on day 5, they start their blood type-specific diet. For patients who have lost too much weight already and must receive some nourishment, nutrients are provided through intravenous infusion during the 3-day fast, explains Dr. Rubio.<p>
<b>Detoxification</b>. Every cancer patient has a body overloaded with toxins derived from foods, previous conventional medical procedures, and the environment, says Dr. Rubio. Hence, American Metabolic places a strong emphasis on detoxifying each patient. In addition, once the immune system is stimulated to start destroying the cancer, the dead cancer cells must be safely removed from the body.<p>
Sources of toxicity often include mercury amalgam dental fillings, says Dr. Rubio. "We find these can leak mercury and diminish the immune system. A patient who has measurable mercury levels in the body must have it removed for the immune system to respond properly." Almost always, this involves the careful removal of all mercury fillings, which American Metabolic handles on site.<p>
<b>Organ Cleansers</b>. Dr. Rubio relies on a series of prepared oral formulas for cleansing different organs. For example, Kidney Rinse combines comfrey, kidney beans, cranberry powder, kelp, and other natural substances to help flush toxins out of the kidneys. There is also a Colonic Rinse (with bentonite powder, psyllium husk, citrus pectin, diatomaceous earth, and various herbs) and a Liver Rinse. <p>
Patients take Acidophilus (3 capsules daily) to recolonize the intestines with "friendly" bacteria. Dr. Rubio also dispenses a preparation called Perfect 7 (an herbal laxative containing plantago and psyllium) to heighten intestinal waste elimination. <p>
<b>Enemas</b>. American Metabolic administers enemas using shark, bovine, chicken, or snake cartilage, often in combination and up to a total of 15 g per enema. When these substances are introduced intravenously, the body can handle a dosage of up to 150 g, says Dr. Rubio.<p>
Biochemically speaking, a cartilage component called mucopolysaccharide helps block the tumor from growing and spreading. Dr. Rubio prefers the snake cartilage for patients with lymphomas, or cancers of the lymph system. For patients with cancers in their digestive system, such as stomach, pancreas, or colon, Dr. Rubio adds colostrum (mother's milk produced immediately after an infant's birthin this case, from cows) to the cartilage enema. Enemas containing medicinal extracts of maitake and shiitake mushrooms as well as the more standard coffee enema are also used.<p>
<b>Herbs</b>. Various botanical supplements are given to help cleanse the patient's liver, lungs, skin, and intestines, says Dr. Rubio. For example, Cascara sagrada is given for the intestines, while licorice root, lemon, and corn silk are for the kidneys, and pau d'arco helps the immune system. Juices freshly made from celery, lettuce, green pepper, carrot, cactus, pineapple, or beet are taken daily, sometimes hourly. Dr. Rubio also relies on herbs native to Mexico such as cuachalalate and candurango.<p>
<b>Enzymes</b>. Dr. Rubio frequently prescribes digestive enzymes to help remove the protective coating around cancer cells that otherwise enables them to avoid being destroyed by the immune system. In most cancer patients, enzymes required for food digestion are usually deficient, leading both to nutritional shortfalls and intestinal toxicity. Dr. Rubio generally recommends German-made Woben-zym N which contains pancreatin, trypsin, papain, and other key enzymes. A typical dose is 2 tablets before each meal.<p>
<b>Intravenous Nutrients</b>. Dr. Rubio administers a range of high-dose nutritional supplements and antioxidants such as selenium, zinc, chromium, copper, magnesium, and vitamins A, B, C, D, E, and K, usually by intravenous infusion. Among these daily nutrients, vitamin A is given at a dosage of 100,000 IU, vitamin C at 150 g, and pycnogenol (an antioxidant from Maritime pine bark or grape seed) at 1500 mg.<p>
<b>Oxygen Therapy</b>. Research has proven that cancer cells grow best in the absence of oxygen and that oxygen, therefore, is deadly for tumors. Dr. Rubio administers oxygen mixed with germanium (a natural element believed to enhance oxygen supplies) through the patient's nose (3 times daily, 10 minutes per session) to raise body oxygen levels. Patients receive ozone (a variant of oxygen) through a self-contained ozone chamber, or rectally, often 3 times daily for up to 20 minutes per session. <p>
<b>Vaccines</b>. A central feature of Dr. Rubio's cancer approach is to culture a special immune-boosting vaccine from the patient's own blood and cancer cells. "All cancer patients need this cancer vaccine because it reeducates the immune system to recognize cancer that previously disguised itself." The nontoxic medications, including herbs, minerals, vitamins, oxygen therapies, and detoxification, all prepare the cancer patient's system for handling the vaccine, Dr. Rubio explains.<p>
First, he extracts a small cell sample of the cancer by needle biopsy and removes the cancer cell coating that blocks recognition by the immune system. Second, Dr. Rubio allows the tumor to grow outside the patient in a laboratory container; then he introduces living white blood cells from the patient into the tumor culture where they coexist for 14-21 days. In the case where a cancer tissue sample cannot be extracted, such as in the brain, Dr. Rubio collects tumor antigens (protein samples of the cancer) from the blood and uses them instead.<p>
The goal is to use this small-scale setting to "train" the patient's immune cells to recognize the cancer cells and "learn" how to destroy them. After the culturing process, the white blood cells are extracted and injected back into the patient's body as an immune-building vaccine. As Dr. Rubio explains, "These white blood cells send biochemical 'messages' to the patient's bone marrow (where such cells are made) to stimulate it to produce the same type of immune cells capable of recognizing cancer."<p>
The patient receives the vaccine by injection once weekly for the 3-5 weeks they reside at the hospital. Afterwards, they must return once every 3 months for a follow-up injection for the next 2 years, then twice yearly for another 3 years.<p>
<b>Other Natural Anti-cancer Agents</b>. Among the 150 anticancer medications Dr. Rubio has at his disposal, there are concentrated shark liver oil and intravenously delivered laetrile (amygdalin, from apricot kernels). Both have clinically and scientifically proven anticancer effects. Dr. Rubio also uses several innovative medicines including Clod-ronate (dichloromethylene bisphosphonate) which is especially effective against bone cancer.<p>
<b>Rife Frequency Generator</b>. In the 1930s, American medical inventor Raymond Royal Rife developed a device that could transmit specific electronic signals to deactivate or destroy living organisms such as pathogens, bacteria, and cancers. Rife's concept was that if you match the energy signal (frequency or rate of vibration) of a cancer cell, for example, with an electronically transmitted frequency, it will cause the cancer cell to explode from an excess of energy. Dr. Rubio's staff regularly use the Rife generator with their cancer patients.<p>
<b>Visualizations</b>. It is vital to attend to the thoughts and emotions of the cancer patient and to encourage them to develop a strong positive attitude about their eventual success in reversing cancer, says Dr. Rubio. A staff psychologist works daily with patients in putting their minds creatively to work in dissolving their tumors through guided mental imagery in which they visualize their immune system destroying cancer cells. "This is an important technique and patients who use it respond better to all the other therapies we provide," says Dr. Rubio. <p>
<b>Low-dose Radiation</b>. "Radia-tion therapy will not cure the cancer but it will sometimes slow down the process to give us time for the alternative therapies to work," says Dr. Rubio. <p>
Here a very low dose of radiationtypically, 1000 rads compared to a normal protocol of 5000 radswill encapsulate the tumor. This can be strategically valuable if the tumor is located on a bone and is progressively weakening the bone structure, leaving it prone to fracture, or if it is located in the chest wall or lungs and is putting a life-threatening amount of pressure on vital blood vessels. <p>
Immediately following the low-dose radiation therapy, Dr. Rubio employs several procedures to minimize the otherwise inevitable damage to the immune system. First, a poultice made of fresh raw cabbage is placed at the external site of radiation to draw out the toxins. Second, the patient is immersed in a whole-body bath containing baking soda, sea salt, and ginger to remove radiation from the body.<p>

<font size="+1"><b>Aromatherapy Oils as Oral Remedies</b></font><p>

<i>Essential plant oils can bring relief for urinary tract infections, high blood pressure, trauma, dental infections, bleeding gums, and, with the help of a medicinal earth, appendicitis, hemorrhoids, Candidiasis, and breast cancer.</i><p>

<blockquote><b><i>Can aromatherapy oils, known as essential plant oils, ever be taken orally instead of being used only on the skin or for inhalation as aromas?</i></b></blockquote>

Yes, but to understand how this works, it's important to know that essential plant oils work as potent antioxidants. The shelf life of a good aromatherapy oil can be at least 30 years, which means it doesn't spoil or lose its essenceit is preserved against the negative effects of oxygen, or oxidation.<p>
Protecting against these effects is the job of antioxidants such as vitamins A, C, and E, yet too often vitamin pills begin to smell rotten after a few months. In this state, their antioxidant effect is lost. There is nothing alive there to keep oxygen from doing its damage; in effect, they're dead nutrients.<p> 	
This line of thinking has led me to experiment with using aromatherapy oils orally, as vitamins, remedies, and medications. There is an essence of life in these plant oils that keeps the oxidation at baya quality that acts as an antioxidant. You might think of the oil as the blood of the plant: without it, the plant is dead. This is why in my practice the antioxidant activity determines whether a substance is alive or not.<p> 
Unfortunately, many aromatherapy oils are not pure but carry contaminants that can act as mild poisons or produce unpleasant side effects if taken orally. Some oils may be pure, but they are not of the highest quality. For example, if they are prepared from dry rather than fresh herbs that still contain the vital oils intact, they are most likely to be incomplete.<p> 
Through my research,  I've found that you will have no problems taking essential plant oils orally if they are pure. But like any other powerful organic substance, such as enzymes or blue-green algae, you must introduce essential plants into your system slowly with proper monitoring. In addition to taking selected aromatherapy oils orally myself, I have administered them in this way to over 200 patients and have had no evidence of toxicity resulting from oral use.<p>

<b>URINARY TRACT INFECTION</b>. Barbara, aged 43, came to me with excruciating pain, fevers, and chills as part of a urinary tract infection. Her condition had been growing worse for a week. She wanted antibiotics and called another physician who gave her a prescription. I always try to keep patients from using antibiotics whenever possible. I offered Barbara an alternative: a mixture of equal amounts of the essential plant oils of lavender, tea tree, and myrrh. Separately, I blended the oils of onion and garlic of which she would take a single drop on the tongue 2-3 times daily.<p> 
With the lavender, tea tree, and myrrh, Barbara dribbled 6 drops into her bathwater then soaked in the solution for 20 minutes. By the time her husband returned from the pharmacy with the prescription antibiotics, Barbara was symptom free. Over the next few days, she continued the once-daily aromatherapy baths, and she daubed a few drops on her palms and inhaled the aroma about 4 times daily. To this day, Barbara has not had a recurrence of the urinary tract infection.<p>

<a name="s02"></a>
<b>HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE</b>. When I first saw him, Martin had dangerously high blood pressure, topping 182/130. I took his blood pressure then asked him to gently inhale the aroma of ylang-ylang essential oil after rubbing it on his palms. After breathing its vapor for only 5 minutes, Martin's blood pressure dropped to 135/80. I tell people to apply the oil directly to their palms, not on a cloth, because whatever is not inhaled as aroma is absorbed directly through the skin.<p>
I must reemphasize that not every version of ylang-ylang oil will produce this remarkable effect in 5 minutes. You need to use oils that are pure and of the highest quality to achieve these effects. People with low blood pressure, however, should not use ylang-ylang oil in this way because it could further drop their blood pressure. I have used this oil with many people with normal to high blood pressure and have had no problems.<p>

<b>TRAUMA</b>. Billy, age 25, had a motorcycle accident, leaving him with skin abrasions and wounds. Fortunately, I had equipped him beforehand with a first-aid kit of essential oils to take on his trip. Immediately after his accident, Billy applied lavender oil directly onto the bleeding abrasions to disinfect, stop the bleeding, and accelerate healing.<p>
He told me afterwards that the wound stopped burning when he applied the oils; instead, as much as this is possible, the wound "felt great," he said. About 2 days after his accident, I examined his wounds and found them all closed. Also at the time of his accident, his ankle appeared fractured; it was swollen and he couldn't walk on it; in addition, Billy had neck pain. Again, he applied lavender oil liberally to these sites every day; within 2 days, the pain was gone. At the same time, he was constantly inhaling ylang-ylang oil for shock recovery and relaxation.<p>
Over the days following his accident, Billy took orange essential oil orally as a general tonic and as a high source of vitamin C. Incidentally, orange oil delivers proportionally a much higher amount of usable vitamin C than most vitamin C pills. Billy took 2 drops of orange oil orally every 4-6 hours for 10 days during his recovery, which was complete.<p>

<b>DENTAL INFECTION</b>. I had a patient named Thomas, aged 70, with an infection at the site of a root canal. This problem had been developing steadily over the previous 5 days.<p>
His left check was swollen and he had fever and chills. I instructed Thomas to take 1 drop each of lavender and orange essential oils and swish them around in his mouth, favoring the area of the infection. He also applied the same amount to his swollen left cheek, gently massaging it into the skin. During the first day, Thomas did both steps twice, after which the infection, pain, swelling, fever, and chills were gone.<p> 

<a name="s05"></a>
<b>BLEEDING GUMS</b>. Frederick had bleeding gums, probably due to a chronic vitamin C deficiency as his diet completely lacked fruits. Instead of starting him on vitamin C, I gave him orange essential oil to take orally. Frederick took 1 drop, 4 times daily; after doing this for a week, all bleeding in his gums stopped.<p> 
Since I knew he was unlikely to radically change his diet or take the proper amount of nutritional supplements I might recommend, I suggested to Frederick that he continue taking the orange oil instead. To make it a little more interesting for him, I mixed equal parts of orange, lime, grapefruit, and Mandarin orange essential oils, of which he now takes 1 drop 4 times daily in lieu of a vitamin C pill.<p> 
I use essential oils instead of vitamins whenever possible. For example, I myself take about 10 drops daily of orange oil; occasionally, I add myrrh 2-3 times a week, as I like the flavor. I also take peppermint oil with meals as a preventive against intestinal parasites.<p> 

<a name="s06"></a>
<b>HOUSEHOLD USES</b>. I continuously inhale the aromas of essential oils, both directly from my palms and from the air in my indoor environment, such as my medical office. As often as 5 times a day, I will daub a few drops of an oil on my palms, rub it into the skin, cup my palms around my nose, and gently inhale.<p>
Before and after patients occupy my office, I mist the air with a blend of various aromas such as lavender, tea tree, eucalyptus, or myrrh (dispersed in water), all of which have strong actions against ambient bacteria, viruses, or fungi. Equal parts of ylang-ylang, orange, or patchouli oils also impart a cleansing atmosphere to my rooms. When patients arrive and inhale the aromas, they are likely to relax, facilitating their recovery.<p>
Let's not overlook the traditional foot bath or full-body soak. Take a large Pyrex glass tray, fill it with warm water, dribble in a few drops of lavender oil, and immerse your feet for 20 minutes. Similarly, you can fill a bath then disperse 5 drops of a single oil or a blend, and soak yourself until you feel relaxed.<p> 
There are so many toxic chemicals in our lives, especially in the home environment, that whenever possible, I try to substitute essential oils to keep the living environment as chemically clean as I can. For example, I use pine essential oil to clean my house, mixing it in hot water as a disinfectant.<p>

<blockquote><b><i>Can essential oils be used to help more serious medical conditions?
Yes, especially when they are used in complement with another substance I have developed, variously called volcanic clay, VMV product, or hemorr-cream.</i></b></blockquote>

<a name="s07"></a>
<b>APPENDICITIS</b>. Robert, aged 36, complained of pain in his lower right intestine which he had endured for a week by the time I saw him. He had fever and chills, there was blood and pus in his stools, and he was becoming constipated. I advised him he needed to go to the hospital emergency room at once for a presumed appendicitis, but he declined. Instead, he said, "Give me something now. I'll go tomorrow, I promise, if I don't feel better."<p> 
I gave Robert a small amount of volcanic claya form of "medicinal earth"which he applied as a compress to his lower abdomen. In one day, the fever was gone, and after a few more days, all his other symptoms disappeared, too. It was most interesting that his next bowel movement after he applied the clay to his abdomen bore highly visible traces of the clay; it had penetrated through his skin into the intestines.<p> 
I had never seen this before in my medical practice, yet it was obvious that when the body needs something, it will do anything to get it to the areas where it is needed most. Robert did well and 3 months later, no sign of his symptoms had returned.<p>
The volcanic clay I'm speaking of is a natural and organic food supplement made of clay from volcanic lake areas and mixed with 18 herbal root extracts from Amazonian rainforest plants. I developed this preparation to supply essential and trace minerals as well as several vitamins in a completely natural and organic form.<p> 
The approach is based on the concept that using the same organic elements that make up the cells of the human body will renew those cells by restructuring the whole organism. I always say I do not "cure" anyone. But if we give the body what it needs, all the essential building blocks, there is no disease that can withstand this.<p> 
For oral use, I mix 1/2 teaspoon of the volcanic clay with a small amount of water in a vial, shaking it thoroughly. It is best to use a plastic or wood (but not metal) teaspoon as the high mineral content of the clay can corrode metal. Then the patient mixes the solution with her saliva, and swallows. Alternatively, the clay may be mixed with 1 tablespoon of unsweetened organic yogurt.<p> 
Conditions such as bad breath, gum inflammation, and dental infections have resolved with the use of this product mixed with saliva, swished in the mouth, and then swallowed. To ensure full absorption, no food is eaten for 30 minutes after taking the clay. You will probably find that your bowels move more often and, if the odor was strong previously, these smells begin to disappear.<p> 
Approximately 85% of people taking the clay daily in this fashion will experience an energy surge within 3-5 days, due to the enhanced nutrition delivered to the body by the clay. If this causes insomnia, decrease the amount or frequency of clay taken. The product may be taken up to 3 times dailymore in certain situations where the energy level is extremely lowor as little as 2-3 times weekly.<p>

<a name="s08"></a>
<b>HEMORRHOIDS</b>. Here is how I use the volcanic clay to treat hemorrhoids. A preparation of the clay mixed with a little water and deposited inside a cannula (a medical tube for insertion into body cavities such as the anus) can be effective. Patients with hemorrhoids can administer one cannula at bedtime followed by another after a week.<p> 
The success rate of this protocol in my experience is 95%. The patients whose hemorrhoids were not completely eradicated had other factors causing them, such as a polyp or cancer of the intestine. I have observed no side effects from this procedure for patients who have hemorrhoids only. Less than 5% of patients I have treated with this intrarectal preparation felt pain around the rectal and prostate areas immediately after administration. These patients had preexisting prostate problems; however, their rectal pain went away after 2-3 more applications.<p>

<a name="s09"></a>
<b>CANDIDIASIS</b>. Taking the volcanic clay orally can help eliminate symptoms of gas, belching, and diarrhea typical of a Candida albicans yeast infection, and usually within a few days. As the process of clearing out intestinal Candida, parasites, and other pathogens and unwanted life forms proceeds, the incidence of diarrhea begins to diminish and transient constipation may result.<p> 
This is actually a good sign, indicating a rapid removal of unwanted intestinal flora. Taking the clay orally, but only once daily before going to bed, will usually resolve the constipation. Another way of regaining normal bowel movements is to temporarily stop using the clay, then slowly restart it at a lower dose. Always pay close attention to how your body feels.<p>
For complete removal of Candida symptoms, every night before going to bed, apply the clay to toe and fingernails and other skin areas suspected of being infected with the fungus.<p>
Martha, aged 37, was obese and suffered from gastrointestinal and toenail Candidiasis fungal infection.  This was probably due to an overuse of antibiotics. She used the clay for 2 months, during which she lost 15 pounds and all signs of fungal infection, gas, bloating, and intestinal distress disappeared. Incidentally, applying the clay to the fingernails enables them to grow at about 3 times the normal rate by increasing their nutritional supply. The increased nutrition is what helps to clear the fungus from the nail.<p>

<a name="s10"></a>
<b>BREAST CANCER</b>. Ellen, aged 76, had a breast cancer 8 inches across that was eroding the chest wall and spreading to her lymph nodes and lungs. Ellen had endured this condition for over 2 years and refused all conventional treatments.<p> 
	Under my supervision, she started applying a mixture of lavender and orange essential oils to her breast and taking 1 drop of orange oil orally with meals, increasing it in a few days to 2 drops, then after a week, to 3 drops.<p> 
After a month, I added 1 drop of lavender oil to the orange, to be taken orally. Ellen also took a small amount of the volcanic clay orally twice daily. In addition, I instructed her to take aloe vera (1 tablet daily), green tea (2 cups daily), Essiac herbs (3 ounces, 3 times daily), and 1 drop of peppermint essential oil added to the orange and lavender taken with each meal to reduce the parasites in her system.<p>
After about 2 months on this program, Ellen's tumor had shrunk by 50%. When she discontinued the clay for 2 weeks, the tumor started to grow again; she resumed the clay and the tumor continued regressing, as before. Ellen tells me she is feeling "fantastic." After having lost 20 poundscancer patients almost always lose too much weightshe is now gaining back her weight and her skin color is improving.<p>
Increasingly, I concentrate on finding the freshest, purest, and simplest way to deal with disease, to have my patients take fewer but more powerful supplements. Eventually, I would like them to have to take only one substance. The closest I've come to this is the combination of aromatherapy oils and volcanic clay. The oils deliver nutrients that dissolve in fat while the clay with minerals delivers nutrients that dissolve in water. This is how the body's nutrition is divided, between fat-soluble and water-soluble nutrients. If you can deliver both through the diet, you are providing the body with everything it needs to be healthy.<p>

  <i>At Arizona Center for Health & Medicine, physicians integrate the best of alternative and conventional approaches in a managed care settingand mainstream insurers are excited about the results.</i><p>

  <b><tt>BY RICHARD LEVITON</tt></b><p>
</center>

<br>

Medical history may be in the making at the Arizona Center for Health and Medicine in Phoenix. It is not so much that the Center's physicians successfully provide nontoxic healing for diverse health problems, but that their manner of delivering it (and having insurers pay for it) may set an important precedent for other clinics in the U.S.<p> 
As health care continues to grow more costly and as ever more Americans demand alternative medicine, Arizona Center's integrated approach, offering the best of alternative and conventional modalities, may represent a viable option for the future. Here, as needed, you can have X rays and Chinese herbs, nutritional counseling and blood tests, and a fair measure of the old-fashioned but therapeutically valid doctor's bedside manner, says Samuel D. Benjamin, M.D., program director.<p> 
"The field of alternatives to drug- and scalpel-based medical care is rapidly growing," he says. "In the long run, we think the issue isn't whether somebody practices conventional or alternative therapies; it's about offering what is best of everything to our patients. We're trying to make a true marriage between mainstream and alternative approaches."<p>
In fact, the range of alternative treatments offered is impressive, including acupuncture, herbs, homeopathy, nutrition, osteopathic manipulation, massage, bodywork, and movement therapies. Disciplines that respect the mind/body unity are the order of the day and it is not uncommon for staff physicians to pray for their patients' recovery and well-being, says Dr. Benjamin, who grew up in a family familiar with traditional remedies such as mustard plasters for bronchitis and in which spirituality was openly respected.<p> 

<b>A ROLE MODEL FOR MANAGED CARE CENTERS</b>.
Dr. Benjamin is well positioned to assess the merits and shortcomings of both conventional and alternative medical approaches. He's practiced both long enough to know what works and what needs to be rejected.<p> 
For example, many patients and, increasingly, physicians, are being "turned off" by conventional medicine because it does not deliver the health it promises, says Dr. Benjamin. "It's taken away our power and control, it's cost us a fortune, it hasn't made us feel any better, and often it creates more disease than it resolves. Our center, in contrast, uses dramatically less technology and testing than any comparable institution using conventional medicine."<p>
On the other side of the ledger, it would be unwise, Dr. Benjamin believes, to assume that everything called "alternative" today is perfectly safe. One way Arizona Center finds a meeting place between both medical approaches is by systematizing treatments and outcomes in the form of computerized flow charts.<p> 
Say a patient starts with a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, explains Dr. Benjamin. First, Center staff consult the database they have compiled, containing standards for specific lab tests and what the range of results typically indicates, along with detailed clinical information regarding all the treatment options. Then, information on each option is called up. For example, if evening primrose oil is on the list, the database can provide all the medical information available on its benefit as an essential fatty acid.<p> 
The result is a kind of standardized medical narrative and treatment flow chart which is then discussed with the patient. It helps a patient learn what to expect from the integrated use of conventional and alternative modalities, says Dr. Benjamin. His staff envisions completing at least 25 such charts in the coming year. "We're doing this to remind our patients that we maintain a certain level of quality and standards. We can't leave everything to guesswork. Yet I don't think this drive towards standardization means we stop being individualized or having the special relationship we establish with patients."<p>
"Our challenge is to find a way to integrate the best of both approaches and to do scientifically legitimate studies in a clinical setting to see what works and what doesn't. We want to be as humanistic, caring, and loving as possible, yet we want equally to be objective and look at appropriate measurements and outcomes to determine the best approaches."<p> 
Dr. Benjamin also notes that "integrative medicine offers individuals the best of standard medicine coupled with complementary approaches that treat the whole person, not just their medical symptoms. We want to return the humanity to medical practice."<p>
Arizona Center must be on to something because they are rapidly setting the pace for the integration of alternative approaches into the mainstream health insurance network. "Our facility is a role model for other planned centers that are expected to expand throughout the country in the near future," Dr. Benjamin notes. He is trying to set up several more clinics around the U.S. based on the Arizona Center prototype, and he's had clinic start-up requests from investors in at least 30 cities, he adds.<p>
The fact is Dr. Benjamin's group is plugged into a prestigious, financially powerful, and exceedingly well-connected health-care network. As such, it could make a huge (and favorable) difference in how alternative medicine is regarded in the U.S.<p> 
Since it opened in 1994, Arizona Center has been a subsidiary of Mercy Healthcare Arizona, a division of Catholic Healthcare West, which operates 32 acute care facilities and 7 medical groups in California, Arizona, and Nevada. With annual revenues in excess of $3 billion, Catholic Healthcare operates an integrated health-care system with one of the largest chain of hospitals in the Southwest; it is also the 5th largest such system in the U.S.<p> 
Another encouraging development is that the former chief executive officer for Samaritan Health Plans of Arizona (the state's third largest insurer) is now working with Dr. Benjamin to develop a program of managed care in alternative medicine. "This will be the first of its kind in the countrya full policy, not a rider, with no limits," he says. "It will be rolled out throughout the state. I think we'll see a similar program emerge in California in the next 2 years or sooner, as several major insurers there have already approached us."<p>
A strong impetus moving these developments is the sheer cost-effectiveness and user satisfaction of alternative medicine. Dr. Benjamin polled 300 Arizona Center patients, comparing their results with patients with similar diagnoses who had only conventional treatments. "Our patient satisfaction level was 95% compared to 76% for the other group," he says.<p> 
"We cut the cost of care by 56% on those diagnoses after 1 year, and we decreased the utilization of emergency rooms." Patients liked what they received at Arizona Center and "went back to their employers and said they wanted to be sure they signed them up with this program next year."<p>

<b>INTEGRATIVE CARE 24 HOURS A DAY</b>. 
The word "integrative" is a touchstone at Arizona Center where it takes on several key meanings. Obviously it means blending the best of alternative and conventional approaches by skillful physicians, as Dr. Benjamin explained above. But the term also denotes the way Arizona Center is making its comprehensive approach available to people across the financial spectrum.<p> 
For example, the Center is working hard to make its approach available to low-income patients. While 78% of their patients are insured by managed care companies, what about the 35% of the population who have no medical insurance? Here, Arizona Center is working closely with state officials to develop alternative medicine programs funded by the State of Arizona and administered by Catholic Healthcare West.<p> 
"We don't believe we're doing this just for people who can pay. We think it also should be for people who can't pay. We have Rolls Royces in the driveway as well as pick-up trucks with kids in the back. We have a commitment to our whole community." Dr. Benjamin also notes that, as a result of their activities, the State is now requiring that all of its employees be insured for alternative medicine.<p>
That is one aspect of the meaning of "integrative medicine" at Arizona Center. But the idea has another twist when you appreciate that sometimes an unlikely member of the Center's devoted staffthe receptionist or janitormay hold the key to healing for a patient. "All of our staff have been trained to understand the interconnected elements of mind, body, and spirituality in healing. Even the guy who mops the floor understands it."<p>
A patient with chronic fatigue syndrome and memory lapses was booked for an 8 a.m. appointment, says Dr. Benjamin. She showed up at Arizona Center at 8 p.m. the night before her scheduled visit. There was nobody around except the janitor. Since he understood alternative medicine (part of his initial staff training), he was able to help her out. "She was very confused and broke into tears. She didn't remember anything and this frightened her." The Center janitor prepared a cup of soothing chamomile tea, gently hugged the woman, and calmed her down. Then he telephoned her husband and even offered to drive her home.<p> 
"That is integrated medicine," says Dr. Benjamin. "It doesn't just involve the doctors, because the physician is not always the only healer." For example, it might be the well-informed receptionist, as this next anecdote reveals.<p>
A man had a baffling and dangerous liver condition. It looked like hepatitis2 liver biopsies tended to support this diagnosisbut his condition wasn't responding to otherwise well-indicated medicines. "His doctors couldn't figure out what was going wrong with this man," says Dr. Benjamin. "He was losing his hair, his sexual ability was substantially decreased, he was markedly confused, and his skin color was changing."<p>
The man called the Center after hours to schedule his first appointment and spoke to the receptionist who was still in the office. After hearing his story, it occurred to her to ask him if he was taking any supplements. He gave her a long list along with dosages. She presented it to Dr. Benjamin, asking him if the patient wasn't taking too many vitamins. "In fact, he was taking about 3,000 times the safe amount of vitamin A and had vitamin A toxicity. Our receptionist, a caring person with no medical training, identified this man's problem. This is typical of what happens here right from the startfrom the moment we first greet a new patient."<p>
Integrative care also means the physician applies it wholeheartedly in his own life, as Dr. Benjamin's personal story shows. When his daughter was born 5 years ago, she was premature, weighed only 2 pounds, and had a fetal growth retardation problem. "I was told by caring doctors that she was an extremely high risk and her chances for a normal life were very slimin fact, zero." Dr. Benjamin thought differently.<p> 
He developed a noninvasive regimen to restore his daughter's health, including therapeutic touch, prayer, color and music therapy, and aromatherapy. "We set up prayer chains for her throughout the country and I think prayer was highly important in the process of healing her," he says. Today, his daughter is 5 and has "a wonderful life as a normal child who is successful in school."<p>

<b>REVERSING 15 YEARS OF LUPUS</b>. 
Pamela, aged 37, was referred to the Arizona Center with a diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus, a serious autoimmune disorder characterized by skin lesions. Pamela had endured this condition for 15 years and was taking several conventional prescription drugs at the time, such as steroids and anti-inflammatories. Her other symptoms included severe arthritis, rashes, back pain, menstrual irregularities, fatigue, intermittent visual disturbances, and inappropriate blood clotting; in recent years, she had also experienced 2 spontaneous miscarriages.<p>
Dr. Benjamin started Pamela on weekly acupuncture treatments and gave her an herbal formula including ginger (180 mg, 3 times daily) and evening primrose oil (500 mg, 4 times daily). He also gave Pamela Bryonia Alba 6X, a low-potency homeopathic remedy which she would take once daily for about 8 months. This remedy, made from the white bryony plant, would help relieve joint pains, body aches, fatigue, and symptoms aggravated by physical movement. Arizona Center staff osteopath, Deborah Heath, D.O., began working on Pamela's musculoskeletal system. <p>
The intensity of her arthritis had disturbed Pamela's posture and gait and misaligned her back. Dr. Heath worked to correct these problems and to stabilize the relationship between Pamela's head and hips using craniosacral therapy, explains Dr. Benjamin. Pamela also had basic structural balance problems which Mark L. Hoch, M.D., Arizona Center family practice physician, improved by using several specific physical therapies called Trager Psychophys-ical Integration and Feldenkrais Functional Integration. These approaches would help "reeducate" Pamela's muscles to a more normal, relaxed way of moving, says Dr. Benjamin.<p>
Dr. Benjamin next took steps to help Pamela develop a strong, positive psychological attitude toward changing her condition. Pamela was guided in the practice of inner visual imaging to gain insight into her body and health problem. <p>
"Through this method we teach patients to visualize their disease and to remove it from their body as they perceive it," says Dr. Benjamin. "We might ask a person, Do you see your illness as a ball and chain around your body? If so, can you undo it and let it go?" <p>
As he does with all his patients, Dr. Benjamin actively prayed for and with Pamela for her full recovery. Putting it in more secular terms, Dr. Benjamin applied a physician's focused intent on behalf of Pamela's healing. It is well-established that patients respond therapeutically to a doctor's belief that they will get better. "We prayed with her all the time, as we pray for all our patients before we start our sessions. We have prayers posted on the walls of our staff meeting room as reminders."<p>
To round out the program, Pamela installed an aromatherapy diffuser in her home and regularly enjoyed the aroma of the essential oil of lemon. The purpose was to help induce a state of greater mental clarity. For stress reduction and to further cultivate a sense of inner calm, Pamela began regular meditation, practiced tai chi (a Chinese form of gentle martial arts-type movements), and exposed herself frequently to blue light as projected by an inexpensive blue light reflector. In Dr. Benjamin's estimation, this color would have a subtle but beneficial healing influence on Pamela based on the specifics of her condition.<p>
Pamela's response to this comprehensive program was rapid, says Dr. Benjamin. "Within 2 weeks, her swelling went down, her mobility increased, her concentration improved, and she was able to spend more time at work." He estimates Pamela's initial rate of improvement as 37%.<p> 
After 2 months on the program, she was about 85% better and was able to discontinue her steroids and anti-inflammatory drugs, in consultation with her conventional rheumatologist, who had cooperated with Dr. Benjamin in his alternative approach. After a full year, Pamela was 90% recovered, says Dr. Benjamin. "She's doing great. She's only had a couple of flare-ups and comes in occasionally for a tune-up. She's back at work. Her memory is fine. She's functional, she has hopeshe has her life back."<p> 

<b>ENDING 10 YEARS OF BACK PAIN</b>. 
Michael, aged 52, had suffered from intense back pain for 10 years. Technically, his diagnosis was severe lumbosacral disk disease with right-side sciatic nerve pain down the length of his leg to his heel. Before coming to the Arizona Center, Michael had received steroid injections in his back and prescription pain relievers.<p> 
While his conventional doctors were recommending surgery, Michael's managed care insurance company wanted to see if the Arizona Center could get some better results first. For his part, Michael was "totally skeptical" about alternative approaches, says Dr. Benjamin, yet he was so discontent with his condition that he was willing to try Dr. Benjamin's program. This included acupuncture, osteopathic manipulation and craniosacral therapy, tai chi exercises, and visual imaging.<p> 
Over the next 4 months, Michael received 8 treatments using these modalities. When Michael was asked to summon up a mental image of his back pain, he said he saw himself as being stuck with a large stake in his back. He revealed to Dr. Benjamin that he literally had seen this happen to a family member in a farm accident. Emotionally, Michael had internalized this incident almost as if it had happened to him instead; in some sense, then, his severe back pain was related to this experience.<p>
"His response to treatment was extraordinary. Even from just the first acupuncture session," notes Dr. Benjamin, "his pain was almost nonexistent." It returned before the next treatment, but then progressively lessened with each subsequent treatment.<p>

  This Issue: <b>W. JOHN DIAMOND, M.D.</b><p>
  <font size="+1"><b>Curing Chronic Fatigue with Homeopathy</b></font><p>
</center>

Here is an intriguing case with many layers and multi-system pathology, involving 14 years of illness and a dramatic outcome only 2 months after treatment.<p>
	When Rebecca, aged 38, first came to me, she had already seen 8 conventional physicians for her multifaceted condition. She had chronic fatigue, depression, joint, muscle, and low back pain, migraine headaches, and severe pelvic and anal pains. Often her knees hurt and her legs would feel heavy. Rebecca had been on antibiotics since she was 20 for pelvic inflammatory disease, but they failed to resolve this problem. She told me she had pain in her pelvis "all the time." <p>
Standard laboratory tests revealed that Rebecca had a low white blood cell count, indicating her immune system was seriously weakened; it also showed she had a high level of Epstein-Barr virus, which is often the case in chronic fatigue patients.<p>

<b>PROBING FAMILY HISTORY</b>. <p>
Rebecca had used 3 different antidepressants but none had lifted her depression. Earlier, a physician had put her on Synthroid, a standard drug for inflammation of the thyroid gland (thyroiditis). Rebecca also felt claustrophobic, had frequent panic attacks, was afraid of new medications, was chronically constipated, and had, in her own words, "no energy." She told me that all aspects of her problem worsened at the age of 24, which I later learned was when she got married to a man who already had 3 young children.<p>
Here is how Rebecca described her state: "When I get a bad pain attack in my back or pelvis, it comes over me in waves and I need to go and hide away in my bedroom and just get under the covers and rest. Sometimes it's for days. The energy just ebbs out of me. When I have no energy, my pelvis aches and throbs. I have to sit down to stop the pain. It feels like my uterus will just about drop out of me." <p>
Further, she had memory and concentration problems, craved salty foods, was usually very hot and sweaty while she slept, and woke frequently at night only to stare emptily at the bedroom wall just as she had done as a child, she told me. <p>
I asked her about her childhood. "It was terrible," she said with emphasis. Both parents had been alcoholics and addicted to drugs. Two older brothers were heavy drinkers and sexually abused her. Rebecca said her mother hated her because she was competition for her husband's affections. Rebecca's mother repeatedly told her she was a worthless child, that she was "a nothing, less than a dog." <p>
Beginning at age 6, Rebecca became a surrogate mother for the household since her mother was chronically drunk. Rebec-ca did all the chores around the house. Mean-while, her father was drunk most of the time and often violent. Her parents argued and fought frequently, and when they did, Rebecca would retreat to her bedroom and stare at the wall. In sum, she was extremely passive, quiet, and depressed as a child.<p>
At age 18, she had an abortion, about which she felt exceedingly guilty, and moved out of the family house. She began drinking steadily, and drifted around until she married at age 24 and moved to another town with her husband and his children. Consider what she did here: Rebecca duplicated the situation she had when she was a child. She became the surrogate mother again, which was, truly, the last thing she wanted to do. Eventually her biology decided this arrangement was not what she needed and shut her down with a mass of symptoms.<p>

<b>WHAT ELECTRODERMAL SCREENING SHOWS</b>. <p>
As part of my medical practice, I regularly use electrodermal screening (EDS) to identify hidden energy blockages in the body. It is also an effective way to get beyond times when a patient prefers not to admit a fact from their history or perhaps literally does not remember it; at such times, these hidden facts may be the key to a case.<p>
My electrodermal evaluation of Rebecca showed highly inflammatory conditions in her tonsils and pharynx. A "normal" EDS reading is about 50, but for Rebecca the needle hovered between 70 and 80. It also indicated trouble in her spleen, liver, kidneys, intestines, and uterus. <p>
In some instances there was a sudden change in the readings, from a high to a low value; in the electrodermal screening world, we call this an "indicator drop" and it is a bad sign. It suggests that the organ is leaking energy and may be undergoing severe degeneration, starting at an energy level and moving into a more tangible deterioration. <p>
On the basis of all the evidence I collected about her symptom picture, it seemed clear to me that there was a strong link between her history of childhood sexual abuse and her chronic pelvic problems. In my approach to homeopathy, I think the first time you see a patient, you need to give remedies that will get the physiological system working properly again. This means removing from the body all the obstacles to healing. Then, according to classical homeopathy, you can give a single remedy and see it work like a "bomb."<p>

<b>REMOVING THE OBSTACLES TO HEALING</b>. <p>
I prepared a remedy program for Rebecca consisting of 6 components. My prescribing philosophy in this case was to give her the strongest remedies possible. With 14 years of  not working correctly, her immune system needed major stimulation.<p>
First, I gave her a homeopathic nosode of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) at a strength of 200C which she would take once weekly for a month. This would help her body start to eliminate the high levels of EBV in her tonsils, liver, and kidneys. <p>
Second, I gave Rebecca a nosode called Viricin to be taken once daily. This broad-based formula has all the main viruses including EBV but at a low potency. I wanted to be sure to catch all the virus problems. <p>
Third, Rebecca took Rehmannia 6, a remedy composed of Chinese herbs, to address the energy imbalance in her kidneys as evidenced by her night sweats. She took 3 tablets, 3 times daily.<p>
Fourth, I prescribed a homeopathic formula, in this case, for detoxification. This was a combination of 3 low-dose "drainage" remedies (called Liquiessences) for the lymph, kidneys, and liver in potencies of 1X and 2X. Rebecca took these drops 3 times daily.<p>
Fifth, I selected a single homeopathic remedy called Sepia 12C according to classical homeopathic prescribing. Rebecca took Sepia once daily. This remedy comes from squid ink and its maritime qualities (and other psychological and physiological factors) perfectly matched Rebecca's conditioneven her choice of words such as "waves" and energy "ebbs." <p>
In fact, her expression that her uterus felt as if it might "fall out" is typical of the type of images that consistently are presented by patients needing Sepia. The sense of her uterus falling out, the sexual abuse, the abortion and the subsequent guiltthese are all connected. It was as if, on a psychological, or metaphorical, level, Rebecca wanted to get rid of her uterus, to push it out so the remembrance of the experience would be gone from her along with the organ that bore its memory. <p>
Sixth, I addressed her chronic constipation and years of excessive antibiotic intake by giving her Multiflora, a "friendly bacteria" or probiotics product. This blend contains Acidophilus and Bifidus cultures and fructo-oligosaccharides (which are helpful "fast food" for the beneficial bacteria). She took 2 capsules, 3 times daily to start restoring the normal population levels and balance of intestinal microflora previously destroyed by all the antibiotics.<p>

<b>CONFRONTING HER PAST</b>.<p>
Rebecca left my office with these 6 remedies and instructions to take them all concurrently, and didn't call me for a month. When she did, her report was highly encouraging. The first several days on the remedies the pelvic pain had worsened, followed by a copious vaginal discharge of in her words, a "smelly yellow liquid." This went on for 3 days, but when it stopped, she felt "so much better." <p>
A temporary worsening of symptoms followed by an often powerful discharge then rapid improvement is typical of how homeopathic remedies work. I interpreted the discharge as her body's way of getting rid of what was ailing in her pelvis. In a sense, her body materialized all the emotional toxins (from parental abandonment, sexual abuse, and other traumatic factors from her personal history) and forcibly expelled them from her body. <p>
While the vaginal discharge was under way, Rebecca was exhausted, but as soon as it was finished, her energy began increasing daily until she estimated about 80% of her normal energy level had returned, meaning how she once felt before she became sick. After a week, her sleep improved and her constipation gave way to normal, daily bowel motions. She stopped feeling cold and stopped craving salt; her panic attacks disappeared and she was no longer fearful about taking new medicines. (Initially, Rebecca had been highly resistant to the remedies and I had to persuade her that it was in her best interest to take them.)<p>
She said that emotionally she felt remarkably improved and that the pain had receded from her anus and pelvis and was localized over the bladder and uterus. Overall, the pain had decreased by 50%, but for me, this wasn't good enough. I was left with a woman whose physical symptom picture had markedly improved yet she still had 50% pain in her pelvis. Using electrodermal screening, I found that there was no evidence of Epstein-Barr virus anywhere in her system; the only organ carrying any imbalance was her uterus.<p>
To address these remaining conditions, I gave her a single homeopathic remedy called Staphysagria (larkspur seeds) at a medium strength of 200C. This remedy often helps break open a condition of internalized anger.<p>
Rebecca came to my office a month later with good and surprising news. The day after she took the Staphysagria, her anger welled up so strongly that she was mad at everyone in her lifehusband, children, and parents. She telephoned the latter and directly confronted them with their neglect and abuse of her as a child. She had avoided speaking with them for years before this moment. Then she took an angle iron and smashed up her garage door until all the anger was discharged. From that moment, the remaining pelvic pain disappeared and has not returned. <p>

 <img src="images/clear.gif" width="20" height="1" border="0" alt="">
I have a close friend who is on a weight loss diet that is a mildly modified version of the Atkins Diet, which restricts the consumption of carbohydrates and grains. One who wants to lose 14 pounds in 2 weeks does not eat pasta, bread, grains, or sugars of any kind. The greasier the better, says one doctor in Arkansas. He says you can eat all the eggs, cheese, and peanuts you want. I am worried that this diet could be harmful to the future of one's health which is why I refuse to try such a diet. Could a nutritionist address this question?

Weight loss can be a very confusing endeavor. There is a wide choice of eating styles, each one claiming to be the "end-all" of dieting. The low-carbohydrate, high-protein, high-fat diet your friend is experimenting with will probably help her to lose weight, but most likely the loss will be only temporary. This diet may cause other health problems down the road.<br>
 <img src="images/clear.gif" width="20" height="1" border="0" alt="">
This particular fad diet, which resembles the ones promoted by Drs. Atkins, Stillman, and Scarsdale, is founded on the physiologic activity of the hormone called insulin which controls the conversion of food into energy and fat stores. While adequate insulin is required for proper food utilization, excessive insulin release can stimulate the metabolism of fat (adipose) tissue and actually cause you to gain weight.<br> 
 <img src="images/clear.gif" width="20" height="1" border="0" alt="">
The standard American diet is often high in refined carbohydrates (sugar and white flour), fats, and chemical additives and these force the body's insulin regulation out of balance. The end result is weight gain and a slow metabolism.<br>
 <img src="images/clear.gif" width="20" height="1" border="0" alt="">
Instead of eliminating the poor food choices that damage the insulin mechanism, these fad diets limit carbohydrate intake which temporarily disables the triggering of insulin release. Unfortunately, the increase of protein and fat in this diet can be extremely detrimental to other body systems. Electrolyte imbalance, increased cholesterol and triglycerides, heart disease, diabetes, and arthritis are just a few of the possible health consequences.<br>
 <img src="images/clear.gif" width="20" height="1" border="0" alt="">
Your best bet is to avoid all diets completely. Instead, consider beginning a lifetime of nutritious eating, enjoying natural, fresh, minimally processed, fiber-rich foods, less refined carbohydrates, and denatured, hydrogenated, saturated fats. You will then most likely reach your appropriate weight, naturally.

<b><a name="ProstateCancer">Prostate Cancer Update</a></b><p>
 <img src="images/clear.gif" width="20" height="1" border="0" alt="">I'm writing to offer additional information about my prostate cancer patient as reported in your magazine (Digest 15, Holistic PhysicianProstate Cancer). This information is crucial to understanding the significance of the case. The patient was diagnosed with a moderately differentiated prostate cancer at a major cancer institution in New York City in February 1994. His PSA (prostate specific antigena prostate tumor marker) then was 7.0, but 2 months later it was 8.3. He was first seen at our center in May 1994 at which time his PSA was 8.6.<br>
A radical prostatectomy or radiation was recommended by each of the conventional doctors he consulted, but the man was reluctant to undergo either because of their serious side effects. Instead, he chose to start an intensive alternative treatment program. Over the next 2 years, his PSA varied somewhat, in part depending on how closely he was following the program and the amount of stress in his life.<br>
 <img src="images/clear.gif" width="20" height="1" border="0" alt="">In June 1995, 16 months after his diagnosis, his PSA was 8.23, which was lower than when he began treatment with us 13 months earlier,  then in April 1996 it went up slightly to 9.19. During the summer of 1996, this patient did very little of the prescribed program and his PSA climbed to 12.02 by October 1996 when we saw him again. At that point, he went back on the program and his last PSA in November 1996 was 12.04. If he remains consistently on the program, I believe that his PSA will remain stable or go down.<br>
The important point with regard to this case is that his prostate has not significantly worsened over almost a 3-year period using only alternative cancer treatments, even though he has not been totally consistent in following them. A radical prostatectomy (surgical removal of the prostate gland) would have almost certainly caused complete sexual impotence and, probably, urinary incontinence.<br> 
 <img src="images/clear.gif" width="20" height="1" border="0" alt="">Radiation is also likely to have made him impotent and produced other side effects. Since the patient is happily married and has an active sex life, he is happy with his decision to avoid conventional procedures whose track record for success is quite questionable.

<b>BRAIN SUPERHORMONE<br>
Age-Proof  Your Brain
with a DHEA Precursor</b><p>

Although many assume that with aging comes an inevitable decline in mental abilities, there are alternative approaches that can forestall any diminishment in brain power. One such promising approach is the use of a hormone called pregnenolone, says hormone and antiaging expert William Regelson, M.D., professor of medicine at the Virginia Common-wealth University in Richmond.<p>
According to Dr. Regelson, adequate research now supports pregnenolone's ability to enhance memory, improve concentration, reduce mental fatigue, and generally keep the brain functioning at peak capacity. Pregnenolone is a hormone produced in the brain and adrenal cortex from cholesterol; in turn, pregnenolone is the "parent" hormone for DHEA and other key hormones. Usually, starting at age 45, pregnenolone production slows down, and by the time one turns 75, the body is producing 60% less pregnenolone than in one's youth, says Dr. Regelson.<p>
Indications that pregnenolone could improve brain power were first demonstrated in experiments with students and factory workers in 1945. Researchers at the University of Massachusetts found that giving students once daily 50-mg doses of pregnenolone noticeably improved their psychomotor performance, hand-to-eye coordination, learning, memory, and stamina.<p> 
The biggest improvement in these skills occurred after 2 weeks on this dosage, indicating pregnenolone's benefit to mental function may be cumulative, says Dr. Regelson. Factory workers taking the same dosage experienced improved productivity and stress reduction, and felt happier.<p> 
Rahmawhati Sih, Ph.D., a researcher at St. Louis University School of Medicine in Missouri, has experimented with 500-mg doses of pregnenolone with elderly men and women. Dr. Sih found that in as little as 3 hours after taking the hormone, the subjects performed better in memory tests, visual-spatial tasks, and verbal recall. A 1992 study involving mice showed that pregnenolone is several hundred times more potent than any other memory enhancer previously tested. The researchers also reported that pregnenolone is able to restore normal levels of hormones vital to memory, which otherwise decline with aging.<p>
As Dr. Regelson sees it, an ideal memory-building agent would be one that is so effective that only a miniscule amount would be required to produce the desired effects. "Recent studies in both animals and humans indicate that pregnenolone may be this ideal memory-enhancing drug and also that it is the most  potent memory-enhancing substance known."<p> 
Dr. Regelson advises that the usual dose for pregnenolone for brainpower enhancement is 50 mg daily, best taken in the morning. To find out if your pregnenolone levels are too low, Dr. Regelson recommends a blood test or a salivary hormone profile; also, watch for specific signs of a pregnenolone deficiency, such as impaired thinking, the sense that you are not as sharp or smart as you once were. Generally, one can expect a "modest improvement" in brain power within hours after taking pregnenolone, he says, but, as this hormone's effect is cumulative, the "true beneficial effects" will emerge over time.<p>

<b>GET FAST HEADACHE 
RELIEF WITH TIGER BALM</b><p>

The next time you find yourself with a tension headache, consider daubing a little Tiger Balm ointment on your temples instead of popping an aspirin. Tiger Balm is a popular Asian-originated pain-relief formula containing camphor, menthol, cajuput, and clove oil.<p> 
According to a report published in Australian Family Physician, when 57 individuals with tension headaches applied Tiger Balm topically to their heads, they had significantly greater pain relief in as quickly as 5 minutes and lasting up to 2 hours. Even better, Tiger Balm was particularly effective at relieving headache discomfort during the first 5-15 minutes of onset, in comparison both to placebo and acetaminophen (Tylenol), taken orally.<p>

<b>FLOWER ESSENCES TO SOOTHE THE EMOTIONS OF MENOPAUSE</b><p>

Flower essences provide strong support for the mental and emotional issues that women encounter during menopause, says Patricia Kaminski, a leading practitioner of flower essence therapy and cofounder of the Flower Essence Society in Nevada City, California. Here are Kaminski's recommendations for flower essences to help women deal with menopause's emotional issues.<p>
<ul>
 <li>Alpine LilyThis helps women integrate the bodily experience of menopause, to move through the physical sensations of pain or discomfort toward a deeper sense of one's femininity.<p>
 <li>Black CohoshThis herb is well-known for its estrogen-balancing qualities, says Kaminski, but when used as a flower essence, it works more energetically to open up blocked energy in the pelvic region, especially for women who feel anger, rage, or violence during the transition.<p>
 <li>California Wild RoseThis essence helps women who feel drained or exhausted or who tend to look back to their earlier life rather than forward.<p>
 <li>Fairy LanternThis flower essence is helpful to women who find themselves resisting the developmental aspect of menopause, especially expressed as a fear of aging or a psychological need to remain inappropriately young.<p>
 <li>HibiscusWomen who feel emotionally "dry" or who have reduced sexual sensation and response and who need to redefine their sexuality will benefit from this essence, Kaminski says.<p>
 <li>PomegranateThis essence can help women redirect the psychological and physical forces of procreativity and reproduction into a new level of inner creativity.<p>
 <li>Sage"Water" problems can manifest as increased sweating or urination as well as an overabundance of "watery" emotions, says Kaminski. Sage can help refine these into calmer, more objective feelings.<p>
 <li>SagebrushThis es-sence is important during menopause because it can help cleanse and release accumulated physical and psychic toxins and instill a sense of inner stillness, or "pause."<p>
 <li>Scarlet MonkeyflowerThe qualities of this flower essence help a women understand the emotional message of hot flashes.<p>
 <li>WalnutWhen stability is needed and a woman needs to break old links or drop dysfunctional identities and move forward with new purpose, this essence is useful.<p>
 <li>YarrowKaminski advises that this essence helps a woman who feels emotionally over-expanded and hypersensitive during menopause.<p>

<b>7 HERBS TO PREVENT YOUR NEXT COLD OR FLU</b><p>
"The best way to take care of colds and flu is to prevent them in the first place," says herbalist Daniel Gagnon, executive director of the Botanical Research and Education Institute and owner of Herbs, Etc., an herbal manufacturing company, both in Santa Fe, New Mexico. Here's what Gagnon recommends:<p>
<ul>
 <li>AstragalusThis herb is excellent for strengthening the immune system before a cold or flu shows any evidence of developing. Gagnon advises 15-30 drops of liquid astragalus herbal extract daily for 1 month as a preventive measure.<p>
 <li>SchisandraThe berries of this shrub, native to China, are effective in helping the body cope with stress and in enhancing its immune resistance. Gagnon advises taking a preventive dose of 15-30 drops, twice daily for 1 month.<p>
 <li>Echinacea/GarlicDespite the best-laid plans, it is not always possible to permanently forestall a cold, so when the earliest signs appear (scratchy throat, stuffed nose), Gagnon recommends taking the following for 1 day: Echinacea (30-50 drops of liquid extract every 2 hours), vitamin C (500 mg, every 2 hours), garlic (1 capsule every 2-3 hours, enteric-coated for digestion in the small intestine), and the proverbial chicken soup or vegetable broth (1 bowl, 3-4 times daily). If you prefer fresh raw garlic, Gagnon says to use 4 g or about 1 medium-sized clove, but not to exceed 5 cloves daily to avoid heartburn or flatulence.<p>
 <li>ElderberryThe extract of the elderberry fruit can be effective in halting the advancement of flu. Gagnon recommends 40 drops taken every 4 hours.<p>
 <li>GoldensealIf your cold has advanced to the stage in which your throat, sinuses, and lungs are inflamed, the phlegm you cough up is thick, your chest feels tight and sore, and your cold seems to have taken up residence in your lungs, it is still not too late for goldenseal to be of benefit. This herb can help relieve the inflammation of mucous membranes which, under these conditions, no longer can protect the body against the influx of bacteria and viruses. Gagnon suggests taking 20-30 drops of goldenseal extract every 2-3 hours until the inflammation is relieved.<p>
 <li>OshaAlso known as Porter's lovage, the root of osha has been used traditionally for sore throats and lung congestion. According to Gagnon, osha stimulates the lungs to remove accumulated debris-laden mucus, and move it into the throat for elimination from the body. Gagnon recommends taking 30 drops of liquid osha extract every 3-4 hours, or up to 5 times daily. Pregnant women should not use osha or goldenseal, he adds.<p>

<b>HERBS TO REDUCE AN
ENLARGED PROSTATE</b><p>

Men between the ages of 40 and 59 have a 50-60% chance of having a benign swelling of the prostate gland, states naturopathic physician Donald J. Brown, N.D., director of Natural Products Research Consultants.<p> 
One of the prime symptoms of this condition (called benign prostatic hyperplasia, BPH) is difficulty in urinating, including pain, hesitation, strain, decreased force, increased frequency, incomplete emptying of the bladder, or dribbling after urination, says Dr. Brown. He offers the following naturopathic recommendations for reduction of prostate enlargement:<p>
<ul>
 <li>Saw PalmettoEuropean studies have shown saw palmetto liquid extract to be as effective as Proscar, the conventional BPH drug, but with far fewer, if any, side effects, says Dr. Brown. The extract also reduces the effect on the prostate of the hormones estrogen and testosterone.<p> 
     Saw palmetto tends to be quick acting, he adds, citing a 28-day study in which 110 BPH patients took 320 mg daily after which their painful urination was much reduced. In another study, a 43% increase in urine flow was produced after only 60 days of taking saw palmetto at 320 mg daily, and when 305 BPH patients took 160 mg twice daily for 3 months, 88% rated their treatment a success. <p>
     Dr. Brown recommends taking 320 mg daily, either in 1 or 2 doses, for 4-6 weeks, then evaluate the results; if favorable, add saw palmetto to your daily supplement program, he says.<p>
 <li>Stinging NettleAlso known as urtica, this herb works to reduce inflammation and congestion of the prostate gland. In a 12-week study involving 2,080 BPH patients, taking 160 mg of saw palmetto extract and 120 mg of stinging nettle extract produced a 26% increase in urine flow, 44% reduction of residual urine, 62% reduction in pain upon urinating, 53% reduction in dribbling after urination, and a 50% reduction in nighttime urination.  Dr. Brown advises taking 120 mg twice daily of stinging nettle.<p>
 <li>PygeumDr. Brown recommends 50-100 mg twice daily of a liquid extract made from the pygeum bark.<p>
 <li>MineralsDaily dosages of 30 mg zinc and 100-200 mcg of selenium help prevent BPH and prostate cancer, says Dr. Brown.<p>
 <li>DietDr. Brown advises men to keep their dietary intake of saturated fat low, including red meat, milk, and fried oils. They should emphasize fresh vegetables, fish, soy foods, and olive oil instead; even better, a vegetarian diet can reduce the amount of circulating hormones in the system (believed to be involved in BPH).<p>
 <li>Know Your ProstateDr. Brown cites a poll published in the London Times (March 26, 1995) indicating many men and women have no idea where the prostate is located in the male body. Specifically, 89% of men polled did not know where the prostate gland is, 62% mistook it for the bladder, only 50% of the men knew that prostate problems were only possible in male bodies, and only 41% of women were able to correctly identify the prostate gland.<p>

<b>STEMMING A HEAVY 
MENSTRUAL FLOW</b><p>

Many women experience an abnormally heavy menstrual flow, often on the first or second day of their period, a condition called menorrhagia, says women's health expert Christiane Northrup, M.D. If unchecked, regular heavy bleeding can lead to anemia, she adds.<p>
<ul>
 <li>CausesHeavy menstrual flow  can be caused by a hormonal imbalance such as too much estrogen and insulin and too little progesterone, or an imbalance of a prostaglandin hormone called F2 alpha, says Dr. Northrup. Physical factors such as a uterine fibroid or a condition called adenomyosis (endometrial glands lining the uterus grow into the uterine muscle) can produce heavy blood flows each month.<p>
 <li>PreventiveAs a first step, Dr. Northrup advises women with overly heavy menstrual flow to rule out all other factors by having a physical exam and a Pap smear.<p>
 <li>DietYou can regulate your hormonal environment through diet, says Dr. Northrup. If you are a carbohydrate-sensitive woman (you crave sugar or salty snacks, are overweight, or have type O blood), it is advisable to reduce your consumption of these foods. They increase insulin levels in the blood and can lead to excess body fat; this in turn is associated with excess circulating estrogen, and this can upset the estrogen-progesterone balance. If necessary, limit your carbohydrate intake to once daily and make sure they are complex, not simple carbohydrates, she says.<p> 
     Specifically, Dr. North-rup recommends soy foods (miso, tofu, tempeh, soy sauce) and certain green vegetables (broccoli, kale, collard greens, Brussels sprouts).<p>
 <li>ExerciseThe goal here is to reduce body fat as a way of controlling excess estrogen, says Dr. Northrup. She advises 30 minutes of aerobic exercising 3 times weekly.<p>
 <li>Natural ProgesteroneDr. Northrup advises applying 1/2 teaspoon of a natural progesterone cream (such as 3% ProGest) to your palms or skin 2 times daily beginning 2-3 weeks before menstruation. Results should be apparent within 3 months, she says. <p>
     If a stronger dose is required to counteract the estrogen, micronized oral progesterone tablets (by prescription) can be helpful, when taken at 100 mg twice daily for 2 weeks before menstruation, says Dr. Northrup. Two weeks after the period is finished, resume at this dosage, she adds.<p>
     According to Dr. Northrup, it occasionally may be necessary to use a synthetic progesterone such as Provera especially if you have a bleeding fibroid and the other natural remedies have failed to stem the heavy flow. Here Dr. Northrup suggests a dosage of 10 mg Provera 1-2 times daily for the 2 weeks preceding the period, followed by 2 weeks off, then continuing the cycle for a total of 3 months.<p>
 <li>Iron SupplementIf anemia is suspected as a result of heavy flows (and especially in thin women), Dr. Northrup recommends ANR Iron 27+. This provides 27 mg of time-released iron, which comes buffered with 120 mg of vitamin C and 75 mcg of vitamin B12. This iron formulation also contains amino acids and is designed to reach the small intestine before it is digested.<p>
 <li>Castor Oil PacksCastor oil benefits the lymph system and liver and may help balance hormone levels. Starting 2 weeks before menstruation, Dr. Northrup suggests applying a castor oil pack to the lower abdomen for 1 hour, 3 times per week. To prepare your own pack, heat (but do not boil) enough castor oil sufficient to soak a small flannel cloth; wring out excess oil, fold the flannel into squares, then place it on the abdomen. To keep it warm, you may place a hot water bottle (wrapped in a towel) on top of the castor oil pack.<p>
 <li>NSAIDsIt may be necessary to resort to a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), says Dr. Northrup, beginning 1-2 days before menstruation and continuing through the days of heaviest flow. She advises using the lowest possible dose (Advil, Orudis, or Aleve) at which effects are apparent and to take the NSAIDs with bananas to prevent stomach upset.<p>

<b>ANGINA</b><p>

Albert, aged 70, had suffered with severe angina for almost 10 years. He had an average of 10 searing chest pains daily. In an attempt to correct this, his conventional physicians had performed 14 balloon angioplasties and one heart bypass surgery. By the time Albert came to Guillermo Asis, M.D., of The Marino Center for Progressive Health in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Albert's doctors had essentially written him off as untreatable. They had advised him to take as much nitroglycerin as he needed to get pain relief.<p>
"It was a serious case," says Dr. Asis. "His doctors literally did not know what else to do for Albert." However, in the view of Dr. Asis, Albert was medically treatable. <p>
He put Albert on a once-weekly program of chelation therapy to improve his circulation and heart function. For approximately 3 hours per session, Albert sat comfortably in Dr. Asis' office receiving an intravenous infusion of EDTA, the prime substance used in chelation therapy.<p>
In addition, Dr. Asis gave Albert "a very aggressive" multivitamin supplement called Vitality Plus (with high levels of the B vitamins, zinc, and copper) which he took 6 times daily. Albert also began taking magnesium aspartate (400 mg, 4 times daily) and zinc picolinate (50 mg daily). The purpose for these 2 supplements is that the chelation process unavoidably flushes these minerals out of the body, so adequate levels of both must be restored, says Dr. Asis. Albert started taking grape seed extract (50 mg, twice daily, as an antioxidant to help remove free radical poisons) and selenium (200 mcg, twice daily, an antioxidant known to benefit the heart).<p>
Within 8 weeks, Dr. Asis was able to take Albert off all conventional heart medications. Even better, his angina symptoms were dramatically improvedAlbert experienced only 1 incident of chest pain per month. Albert received a total of 12 chelation treatments. By the end of the 3-month treatment, "virtually all of Albert's symptoms and discomfort were gone and he continues to do very well," says Dr. Asis.<p>

<b>ANXIETY</b><p>

About 3 months before she first consulted naturopathic physician Deborah Frances, N.D., of Grants Pass, Oregon, Susan suddenly began having anxiety attacks while visiting a relative. According to Dr. Frances, Susan reported a racing heart, terrible fear, and a "feeling like my soul is being sucked out of me." She added that her anxiety was easily relieved if she got distracted by something else.<p> 
Susan's medical history revealed childhood neglect and emotional abuse and the traumatic loss of a highly supportive younger brother that left her feeling "devastated." Since the birth of her son several years earlier, Susan had recurrent fears of and nightmares about danger to her newborn, sudden loss of her husband, and images of inexplicable invasion. During her interview with Dr. Frances, Susan wept as she described a "deep grief and longing to return home" to her childhood residence. At the time of the consultation, Susan was taking Xanax, a conventional antianxiety drug; she also indicated that she had undergone years of psychotherapy.<p>
Dr. Frances prescribed Piper Methysticum, a homeopathic remedy made from kava to be taken 3-4 times daily at 10-30 drops per dose. "My experience of Piper is that it seems to have an ability to lift one up out of darkness into a clearer, higher place," explains Dr. Frances.<p>  
Next she gave Susan a mixture of Rescue Remedy (an emotional first-aid preparation made from several flower essences) and the herb Oplopanax horridum, to be taken at least 4 times daily (2 drops each dose) and as additionally needed for anxiety. Dr. Frances prescribed this herb (often given for blood sugar disorders) because she knew it could help Susan develop a more self-confident psychological attitude, enabling her to "stand up for herself effectively, appropriately, and even fiercely," says Dr. Frances. In her view, anxiety is often associated with feelings of disempowerment.<p>
About 5 days after starting these remedies, Susan reported she was feeling relief. Dr. Frances added homeopathic Phosphorus to Susan's program. After a month, Susan was much improved, being better able to deal with the anxiety surges when they arose and no longer waking in the mornings filled with anxiety from her dreams. Around this time, the conventional physician who had prescribed the Xanax, began reducing the dose.<p> 
Several weeks later, Susan told Dr. Frances she was continuing to improve but had discontinued the Piper Methysticum because she disliked its taste and smell, and felt unexplainably afraid of it. Dr. Frances interpreted this information as indicating Susan was ready for the next stage in the prescribing. Dr. Frances put together an herbal formula to help release Susan's nostalgic attachment to and loss of personal power in her childhood. The herbs included 2 parts each of rose, passionflower, oat, and lemon balm, and 30 drops of sagebrush; the entire mixture was to be taken 3-4 times daily, 10-30 drops per dose.<p>
After about 6 weeks on this formula, Susan told Dr. Frances that her anxiety was steadily decreasing. The nightmares about her son and husband had stopped and she no longer felt the strong grief and longing for her childhood home.<p>

<b>CANCER</b><p>

In 1978, Millicent, aged 45, was diagnosed with an advanced stage of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (cancer of the lymph tissues) involving lymph nodes in her neck, groin, and armpits. She was also found to have a tumor mass dangerously compressing her spinal cord in her lower back, explains Michael B. Schachter, M.D., director of the Schachter Center for Complementary Medicine in Suffern, New York, who first saw Millicent after her biopsy.<p> 
The classification of this tumor (stage IVB) is conventionally associated with a 5-year survival of only 50%, or worse, says Dr. Schachter. "Millicent fought her cancer courageously with a variety of treatments, both conventional and alternative, for 7 years," he notes. In all, Millicent received treatments from at least 6 different alternative medicine physicians in addition to several conventional oncologists.<p> 
Millicent started the Gerson Diet Therapy (developed by Max Gerson, M.D., 1881-1959) which emphasizes the consumption of copious amounts of fresh vegetable juices. Over the course of several years, she received other major alternative cancer approaches, one being Immune Augmentation Therapy (developed by Lawrence Burton, Ph.D., 1926-1993) which involves the injection of certain blood proteins to stimulate the immune system.<p> 
Millicent also had injections of crucial immune system cells called lymphocytes; a series of heat treatments called whole-body hyperthermia in which a temporary fever is induced to enhance the immune system; infusions of high doses of vitamin C with amygdalin (or laetrile, prepared from apricot kernels); and numerous oral supplements, both herbal and nutritional. At other times, Millicent underwent several cycles of radiation and chemotherapy, including Cytoxan, Adriamycin, Bleomycin, and 5FU, "all well known for their potential toxicities," notes Dr. Schachter.<p>
At times, Millicent experienced a serious adverse reaction to the chemotherapy with significantly large drops in her white blood cell count. In the summers of 1988 and 1989 she had further radiation treatment on her head and neck. Throughout this ordeal, Millicent had recurrent bouts of pneumonia"these are suspected to be complications of her chemotherapy," says Dr. Schachter.<p> 
Millicent also went into early menopause, probably induced by the intense drug treatment. While the combination of multiple alternative therapies and conventional treatments resulted in a series of remissions and partial remissions, she invariably developed a recurrence several months to a year following the partially successful treatments. In 1989, she again began to develop tumors in her neck.<p> 
At this point, Millicent decided to have all of her mercury dental amalgams replaced, based on the recommendations of several alternative physicians. "She has been tumor free since that time for the past 7 years," says Dr. Schachter, "and she attributes her successful remission to having her mercury fillings removed which resulted in no further exposure to mercury vapor emitted from the fillings."<p> 
At her most recent consultation with Dr. Schachter, Millicent was continuing with a healthy diet and taking numerous nutritional supplements including the adrenal glandular extract DHEA (10 mg, once daily). "All 4 of her key cancer markers are normal," says Dr. Schachter, reminding us that Millicent, now 63, is an 18-year survivor of a cancer that had a 10-year survival rate of less than 20%.<p>

<b>DEPRESSION</b><p>

When Penelope, aged 44, first consulted Joan M. Takacs, D.O., an osteopathic physician practicing in Portland, Oregon, she had been diagnosed with manic-depressive illness. Penelope complained of low energy in the afternoons and related episodes of being driven by "overwhelming" emotion and energy surges that gave way to depression, desperation, and suicidal thoughts. Penelope said she felt at these times as if "a dark cloud were hanging over her."<p>
"A weak liver is often responsible for depression," explains Dr. Takacs, who specializes in Anthroposophic medicine, an extension of the best parts of Western medicine that includes homeopathic remedies and a spiritual understanding of patients. "As we see it, the liver is the organ of life, involved in the breakdown and storage of nutrients, the production of many enzymes, and fluid control of the body," says Dr. Takacs. But the liver is also connected to the will and the emotions associated with that, she adds. "With manic states, the will becomes excessively active and the person is driven in terms of thinking and acting."<p>
Dr. Takacs prescribed remedies specific to Anthroposophic medicine including Fragaria vitis (from grape and strawberry leaves) to strengthen Penelope's liver and to aid in carbohydrate and sugar digestion; this remedy would also produce and balance more daytime energy and regulate sleeping cycles. Dr. Takacs also gave Penelope Aurum Stibium Hyocyamus to help strengthen her "heart forces" and to reconnect her thinking and action. "With the balancing forces of this combination of remedies, Penelope was able to overcome her illness," reports Dr. Takacs.<p>
Within a few weeks, Penelope said she was feeling much improved. "She was happier and noticed that upsetting things in life did not send her into profound depression," says Dr. Takacs. Her sleep was more refreshing and she no longer had afternoon energy lows. "After several months, the remedies were discontinued and Penelope has continued to do well," says Dr. Takacs.<p>

<b>ENDOMETRIOSIS</b><p>

When Rosanna, aged 30, first came to Carolyn DeMarco, M.D., in Toronto, Ontario, she had already undergone multiple surgeries for her endometriosis, but with no improvement. Rosanna's pelvic pain was still considerable and she was on Lupron, a powerful hormone drug that operates by deliberately exhausting the brain's pituitary gland (which is responsible for much of the body's hormonal activity). Lupron left her feeling mentally foggy and, at times, mentally dysfunctional.<p>
As a side effect of the Lupron, she went into early menopause with hot flashes and mood swings, for which Rosanna's conventional physicians prescribed synthetic estrogen and progesterone. These in turn produced many unpleasant side effects and by the time Rosanna came to Dr. DeMarco, she was determined to get off her multiple drug regimen and gain relief for her endometriosis.<p> 
Dr. DeMarco started Rosanna on a multifaceted program including castor oil packs  placed on her lower abdomen every evening. These would help draw out toxins, release tension, and increase blood circulation to her pelvic area.<p> 
Next, Dr. DeMarco started Rosanna on a natural progesterone cream, having her apply 1/2 to 1 teaspoon daily to different soft tissue sites on her body, from days 10-26 of her menstrual cycle. To avoid saturating a single area, Rosanna rotated the application site from her face to neck, inner arm, back of the wrist, abdomen, inner thigh, and breast. At the same time, Dr. DeMarco began reducing Rosanna's intake of synthetic estrogen and progesterone over a 4-week period, and she took Rosanna completely off the Lupron.<p>
Dr. DeMarco prescribed a balanced multiple mineral/vitamin supplement for Rosanna, an herbal blend (containing milk thistle, dandelion, and celan-dine) to strengthen her liver, and a lipotropic formula including choline, methionine, and inositol to help her liver break down estrogen. After 6-8 weeks on this combined program, Rosanna's pain was reduced and she was better able to cope with what pain there was, says Dr. DeMarco.<p>
At this point Dr. DeMarco began to address Rosanna's diet and possible food allergies. Prior to this, Rosanna had been unwilling to focus attention here. A comprehensive allergy test revealed that Rosanna had a high degree of Candida albicans yeast infection and parasites. Although the relationship is not yet precisely known, "Candida has a direct effect on hormones, such as estrogen and progesterone, either by binding to the receptor sites or by forming antibodies which can then react against ovarian tissues," says Dr. DeMarco. Other physicians have noted that when they eliminated the Candida infection in women with endometriosis, it helped to improve this condition as well.<p>
Dr. DeMarco addressed the Candida infection with Acidophilus supplements and dietary changes, emphasizing the avoidance of sugars, fruit juices, yeasted breads, fermented foods, dairy products, dried or over-ripe fruits, and processed, canned, or moldy foods. In addition, Rosanna took caprylic acid (made from coconut oil) tablets, 2 before each meal; she continued this for 3 months. She also received desensitization shots for the Candida.<p>
To remove the parasites, Dr. DeMarco put Rosanna on a 90-day herbal program including wormwood, black walnut tincture, cloves, and grapefruit seed extract. As Rosanna was low in DHEA, a hormone produced by the adrenal glands, Dr. DeMarco put her on DHEA plus adrenal and ovarian glandular extracts. She took the DHEA and adrenal glandular on an empty stomach twice daily and the ovarian glandular with meals. "Usually people who have been chronically ill have adrenals that are stressed and under-functioning," says Dr. DeMarco.<p>
In about 6 months, Rosanna reported a 75% reduction in pain. At this point, Dr. DeMarco added another element to the program in the form of a traditional naturopathic herbal formula called Turska, containing monkshood, yellow jasmine, hops, and poke root. Rosanna took this formula at the dosage of 5 drops 4 times daily for the next 6 months.<p> 
At the conclusion of 12 months of treatment, Rosanna was pain free. She had to remain vigilant about her diet, stress levels, and exposure to allergenic substances, and remain on the nutritional supplement program and natural progesterone, says Dr. DeMarco.<p>
Dr. DeMarco notes that evidence from animal and human studies indicates that exposure to or ingestion (through foods) of pesticides such as dioxin can lead to an increase in the rate of endometriosis, presumably because these chemicals mimic the action of estrogen. Dr. DeMarco also notes that many women with endometriosis are deficient in iodine and that elemental iodine supplementation has benefited some patients in whom it acts "like a natural anti-estrogen."<p>

<b>RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS</b><p>

When Phyllis, 55, learned that her neighbor had experienced great improvement in her rheumatoid arthritis through treatment given by Jonathan V. Wright, M.D., director of the Tahoma Clinic, in Kent, Washington, she decided to consult with Dr. Wright for help with her similar condition.<p> 
Phyllis had endured swelling, inflammation, and pain in her knees and fingers for many years and was skeptical of her conventional doctors who had dismissed diet, vitamins, and herbs as having no effect on rheumatoid arthritis. At the time of her first visit to Dr. Wright, she was taking 12 aspirin a day for pain control, but was regularly experiencing heartburn and indigestion as side effects. Her wish was to never have to use aspirin again.<p>
Dr. Wright's recommendations began with improving Phyllis' diet because, in her neighbor's words, she was "one of the worst junk-food junkies" she had ever seen. Dr. Wright suggested that Phyllis change her way of eating to only whole grains and whole, unprocessed foods, free of sugar, and that she avoid soft drinks, caffeine, nicotine, and chemical or artificial additives, flavorings, colorings, and sweeteners.<p> 
He further advised that Phyllis undergo a series of allergy sensitivity tests because "many people with rheumatoid arthritis have so many sensitivities and allergies that telling one from another at the beginning can be nearly impossible," says Dr. Wright. He cites a study in which 21 out of 22 patients with  rheumatoid arthritis who went on an allergy-elimination diet experienced noticeable improvement, usually within 10 days. The study also found that the foods most commonly associated with the allergies are grains, milk, nuts, beef, and eggs.<p> 
In addition, Phyllis was to have tests to evaluate her DHEA (an adrenal hormone) levels and her  stomach's output of hydrochloric acid and pepsin, both required for efficient digestion. Faulty digestion, says Dr. Wright, can also contribute to rheumatoid arthritis.<p>
Next, Dr. Wright proposed a series of supplements for Phyllis. Heading the list was cod liver oil (1 tablespoon, twice daily) supplemented with vitamin E (400 IU daily). The cod liver oil would help reduce inflammation and provide necessary vitmin D to Phyllis' bones. On her neighbor's advice, she had already been taking ginger capsules (9 g daily, in 3 divided doses) and Dr. Wright had her continue with this dosage. A study shows that when 6 patients with rheumatoid arthritis took ginger daily (either 5 g fresh or 1 g powdered) for 3 months, all reported a reduction in pain, an improvement in joint motion, and less swelling and stiffness.<p>
Dr. Wright also recommended a form of B3 called niacinamide (500 mg, 3 times daily) to help reduce swelling; copper sebacate (4 mg twice daily); elemental zinc (in picolinate or citrate form: 30 mg, 3 times daily); boron (3 mg, 3 times daily); chicken cartilage (2 capsules, twice daily); and a balanced multiple vitamin/mineral supplement.<p> 
Dr. Wright notes that in a study of 87 patients with rheumatoid arthritis, selenium levels were noticeably lower than average, and that those with the worst cases had the lowest selenium levels. In a study in which subjects took  selenium (200 mcg daily) for 3 months, 6 out of 8 patients had less joint pain and inflammation as a result. Research indicates that gamma linolenic acid from borage oil (an essential fatty acid) taken at the rate of 1.4 g daily for 24 weeks produced a 36% reduction in overall joint tenderness and a 41% decrease in swollen joints.<p>
Over the course of 2 months, Phyllis underwent all the requested tests and restructured her diet. "Her progress was a little slower than usual," says Dr. Wright, "but after a year she was off the daily aspirin entirely and the pain and swelling in her joints were almost completely gone." After the second year, all her joints had greater mobility but were sensitive to occasional lapses in her diet when inappropriate foods temporarily aggravated them. After 5 years on his program, Phyllis "continues to do well," Dr. Wright says.<p>

<b>BUILD ENDURANCE, REDUCE FATIGUE WITH CREATINE</b><p>

For well-trained athletes who want a way to improve short-term endurance and delay fatigue when exercising intensely, studies show that supplementation with creatine can be effective. In addition, according to  nutrition and exercise therapy professor, Anna MacIntosh, Ph.D., N.D., of the National College of Naturopathic Medicine in Beaver-creek, Oregon, creatine can help enhance athletic performance for individuals who already have significantly developed muscle mass. Creatine is less effective for physically untrained individuals, Dr. MacIntosh adds.<p>
Creatine is a natural component of animal and human muscle and is made of several amino acids (protein building blocks). It is found in its highest amounts in red meats, herring, salmon, and tuna, which means a person eating an average mixed protein diet will consume about 1 g daily. Vegetarians, however, often have lower creatine levels, as do patients with rheumatoid arthritis, fibromyalgia (muscle pain), muscle disease, and acute or long-term circulatory and respiratory problems, says Dr. MacIntosh.<p> 
Clinical studies clearly show that supplementing creatine at the level of only a few grams per day can significantly increase the amount of creatine in skeletal muscles, says Dr. MacIntosh, and that such a practice "may be most beneficial for activities which include some short-term, high-intensity exercise bouts."<p> 
For example, when a group of highly active men took 20 g of creatine daily for 6 days, their "power output" on an exercise bicycle was greater and the onset of muscle fatigue from energy loss took longer than before. In another study involving 24 competitive rowers, supplementation with 20 g of creatine for 5 days led to a general improvement in their rowing time, especially during peak demand in the final stretch of the competition.<p>

<b>LOSE WEIGHT AND BUILD LEAN MUSCLE MASS<br>
Sports Supplement from a Chinese Herb Can Do It</b><p>

A new exercise supplement called Endurox appears to have the ability to help users both lose weight and build greater muscle tone and lean muscle mass, according to studies conducted in Beijing, China. The Chinese connection comes in with the fact that Endurox is based on cuwijia (Acanthopanax senticosus), a root native to northeastern China.<p> 
Traditionally, cuwijia is used in Chinese medicine to  bolster fatigue and enhance immune activity, but Chinese researchers also note that the herb was used by mountain climbers who reported that it boosted their work performance at conditions of high altitude and low oxygen. Laboratory studies found that animals showed the same benefits and that cuwijia increased oxygen supply to the heart.<p> 
Put in practical terms for the estimated 52 million Americans, aged 25-54, who exercise regularly, the pure, standardized extract of the herb, formulated as Endurox, appears to be able to help people lose or control their weight and gain muscle tone. For most, these are the primary reasons for exercising, says biochemist Robert Portman, Ph.D., of Pacific Health Laboratories, makers of the product.<p>
The central fact that emerges from 2 Chinese studies of Endurox conducted at the Institute of Nutrition and Food Hygiene in Beijing is that the herb increases the burning of fat during strenuous exercise. It shifts the energy source that fuels exercise from muscle carbohydrate to fat and it slows down the buildup of lactic acid that always accompanies exercise and leads to muscle burnout and fatigue. The data also suggests that the product can increase exercise endurance and lean body mass (muscle without the fat).<p>
In the first study, physiological changes were monitored in 8 men as they used a stationary bicycle with a performance monitor (ergometer) attached. Prior to the study, the men had received 800 mg of Endurox daily for 2 weeks. As the energy load increased during their bicycle workouts, the lactic acid levels actually decreased by up to 33%. At the same time, there was a 43% increase in the burning of fat during exercise, compared to controls.<p> 
In the second study, researchers made aerobic measurements on 10 men, aged 18-23,  while they exercised on a power bike. This study demonstrated a 30% increase in fat metabolism, a significant decrease in heart rate, and a 4.6% gain in oxygen intake per heartbeat. Principal researcher, Wu Yong Ning, Ph.D., states that the product generates "a carbohydrate-sparing action during both low- and high-intensity exercise."<p> 
The reason this factor is important is that since 1939 exercise physiologists have known that they could increase exercise endurance when athletes are on a high-carbohydrate, low-fat diet. Since then, the training programs for many athletes have included some form of dietary carbohydrate loading. Therefore, a supplement that minimizes the burning of carbohydrates during exercise has obvious advantages.<p> 
Robert Kaman, Ph.D., of the Department of Integrative Physiol-ogy at the University of North Texas Health Science Center in Fort Worth, studied Endurox in a laboratory setting and concluded that it is "a novel agent that increases workout performance." According to Pacific Health Laboratories, the product's manufacturer, Endurox is safe and has no reported side effects. The company also notes that a 30-day supply of the product taken at the dosage level of 800 mg daily costs about $15.<p>

<b>4 STEPS TO BETTER HEART FITNESS<br>
by David Essel</b><p>

Approximately 500,000 people in the United States will die of cardiovascular disease this year, easily making it the leading cause of death in this country. A lesser known fact is that heart disease ranks as the number one killer of women. The reasons for this are varied, but most experts believe the main cause has to do with daily lifestyle choices. The way we deal with stress, the foods we eat, and how we take care of our bodies through exerciseall have a health impact on our cardiovascular system.<p>
	It has been well documented for more than 30 years that exercise can have a dramatic effect on enhancing heart health. Yet, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, only 12-18% of the U.S. population exercise frequently enough to receive these benefits. One of the reasons the other 82-88% don't exercise enough is a belief that they do not have enough time to gain any substantial health benefits from exercise.<p> 
	The fact is, you don't need that much time to benefit. Here are 4 hints for how to approach an exercise program and build cardiovascular fitness into your life.<p>
<b>1.</b> Move at least a little. Set a goal to walk, swim, skate, jump rope, aerobic dance, run or ride a bike 3 times a week for 20 minutes if possible, but even a 10-minute walk is better than nothing. If you are in ill health or over the age of 40, check with your physician first.<p>
<b>2.</b> Exercise can help you control or lose weight. This will likely have a positive effect on your cardiovascular health. Again, the amount of time you exercise is not the most important factor; that you exercise at all is what counts. In a study in the American Journal of Cardiology, physicians showed that there was no significant difference in weight loss between a group who walked nonstop for 30 minutes, 3 times per week, and those who broke a daily walk into 3 sessions of 10 minutes each. Therefore, if you are seriously short of time, set a minimum goal of 3 daily walking sessions of 10 minutes each.<p> 
<b>3.</b> Increasing lean muscle tissue can improve your heart's health. A twice-weekly strength-training program using calisthenics, free weights, or exercise machines in which the major muscle groups of the body (chest, back, legs, etc.) are exercised for 1-3 sets of 8-12 repetitions, can increase lean muscle tissue. This allows the body to burn more calories during the day, thereby assisting in weight loss. 	4. Keep to the program because exercise regularity is important. To stick with any program that enhances cardiovascular fitness, consider the following: Invite a friend to exercise with you one or several days each week. Schedule  your exercise session in your daily planner so it has the same or higher priority as any other meeting for that day. Or use a walkman with your favorite music, book on tape, or motivational audio to inspire (or entertain) you during your workout.<p>
	By following a regular exercise program, you may achieve a reduction in your blood pressure (if it was high), a reduction in triglyceride and LDL cholesterol levels (which can harm the heart), and an increase in HDL cholesterol (the kind that is beneficial to your system).<p>
	A regular exercise program could be one of the most important changes you make to improve your cardiovascular health. However, some people may find the prospect of moving from a sedentary to an active lifestyle daunting, even threatening. It need not be if you tailor your program to your likes and needs, move at your own speed, and respect your limits.<p> 
	As people become more active, they also start to make healthier choices in the foods they eat and the way they handle stress. The beneficial combination created by this "trickle-down" effect may go far in reducing the number of cardiovascular-related deaths.<p>

<b>EXERCISE BENEFITS CANCER PATIENTS</b><p>

The benefits of exercise extend far beyond cardiovascular fitness and the prevention of obesity and heart disease. Exercise aids in detoxification, digestion, weight control, and immune processes and can do wonders for mood and attitude, according to W. John Diamond, M.D., and William Lee Cowden, M.D., authors of An Alternative Medicine Definitive Guide to Cancer.<p>
Patients with advanced cancer who have received conventional medical treatment often spend many hours in a hospital bed, in contrast to those who undergo alternative cancer therapies who typically engage in regular exercise or physical activity. A brisk walk several times a week is a good start for any exercise program; low-impact aerobics, calisthenics, Qigong, stretching and flexing exercises, and gardening, among others, are all ways of strengthening the body's self-healing system.<p>
Among the anticancer benefits of physical exercise, well documented by clinical research, are the following, say Drs. Diamond and Cowden:<p>
<ul>
 <li>Aerobic activities increase oxygen supply to tissues; because cancer tends to flourish in an oxygen-poor environment, the well-exercised body is more likely to repel cancer cells.<p>
 <li>Any form of physical activity, because it involves muscle contractions, helps keep the lymphatic system (which filters toxins from the blood and supports the body's immune system) moving.<p>
 <li>Exercise stimulates the activity of natural killer cells and other components of the body's anticancer defenses.<p>
 <li>Exercise causes an elevation of body temperature and increases the production of pyrogen, a special substance that enhances the function of white blood cells.<p>
</ul>
People who maintain regular activity are less likely to develop colon cancer, the second leading cause of cancer-related death in the U.S. In helping to ward off colon cancer, exercise tends to benefit men more than women. Female college athletes, when compared to their nonathletic counterparts, have a lower incidence of cancers of the breast, ovary, cervix, vagina, and uterus. In the same study, the risk of developing cancers of the reproductive system was 2.5 times lower for the athletes than it was for the sedentary women.<p> 
In a study, men who burned as few as 500 calories a week in exercisethe equivalent to about an hour's worth of brisk walkinghad death rates about 20% lower than men who rarely exercised. More avid exercisers experienced fewer cancer-related deaths: men who walked about 4 hours each week (about 2,000 calories burned) died of all cancers about 35% less frequently than their less active counterparts. A recent report from the Cooper Clinic in Dallas indicates that even moderate exercise5 hours of walking per weeksignificantly reduces the risk of developing prostate cancer.<p>
Exercise also helps cancer patients maintain normal muscle mass, which can increase significantly their chances of recovery, according to Drs. Diamond and Cowden. Patients who are overweight or who lose lean tissue or muscle during therapy tend to have poorer prognoses.<p>

<b>KNOW YOUR TERRAIN<br>
Seeing Disease Before It Manifests</b><p>
A new laboratory testing device called Biological Terrain Assessment (BTA S-1000) developed by naturopathic physician and chiropractor Robert Greenberg, D.C., N.M.D., enables physicians to see evidence of disease at the cellular level before it manifests. Cellular conditions are referred to as biological terrain and represent a generalized picture of the biochemical and electrical health of an individual at the cellular level. The state of your biological terrain is the bedrock of your health.<p>
The BTA S-1000 uses microelectrodes to measure 9 scientific values from samples of a patient's blood, urine, and saliva. The results are analyzed and plotted automatically by the instrument's computer then displayed in graph form on a monitor. Typically the procedure takes 10-15 minutes to complete.<p>
BTA enables the trained practitioner to find conditions that are still subpathological, often long before they develop into concrete illnesses. "If in checking we find that your cellular chemistrybiological terrainis going astray, we know that your entire cellular functioning will soon follow, resulting in illness," Dr. Greenberg explains. "This enables us to then start correcting the imbalance using natural means, such as nutrition, supplements, or homeopathy, among others, before your condition becomes pathological and requires more invasive medical procedures."<p>  	
For example, 100 healthy college students at the University of California at San Luis Obispo were selected for evaluation with BTA S-1000. The individuals were selected according to standard medical norms for "healthy." However, the biological terrain assessment indicated that many of the students had suboptimal biochemical values. Routine exposure to environmental and dietary contaminants presumably was compromising their health at the cellular level, says Dr. Greenberg.<p>
The key point here, he says, is that terrain assessment "gives you the ability to see if the patient's chemistry is running optimally, even if he is not experiencing any symptoms." Further, the approach can reveal information of clinical importance that standard medical testsblood, urine, MRIs, CAT scansmay miss, especially when a patient feels or looks unwell yet no organic evidence of illness has manifested. While the standard test values for such a patient may come back optimal, under BTA they will probably come back suboptimal, says Dr. Greenberg.<p>
Among the parameters evaluated by BTA S-1000, the 3 most central are pH (a measure of acidity or alkalinity), oxidation-reduction potential (a measure of electron movement donation/reduction and accepting/oxidation), and resistivity (a measure of a fluid's ability to conduct an electrical charge).<p> 
The BTA S-1000 is also capable of identifying unsuspected causes for chronic problems. Dr. Greenberg evaluated Susan, aged 36, who had frequent outbreaks of debilitating herpes sores in her mouth. During an episode, they would become so numerous that Susan had trouble eating and drinking. She had consulted many physicians and tried all the drugs they prescribed, but nothing helped her.<p> 
"We did a biological terrain assessment and discovered a cellular picture that looked very much like a heavy metal profile," says Dr. Greenberg. On this basis, he ordered a hair analysis and 24-hour urine test, both of which revealed that Susan had high concentrations of mercury, probably leached into her tissues from her dental amalgams. She had all her mercury amalgams replaced and in the last 18 months has not had a single herpes sore, says Dr. Greenberg.<p>

<b>NUTRIENTS TO HELP REVERSE MACULAR DEGENERATION</b><p>
Macular degeneration is a sight-threatening disorder that affects an estimated 4 million older adults. In this condition, the macula, or central area of the retina, and its pigment deteriorate, resulting in the loss of sharp vision. Macular degeneration is the leading cause of severe visual loss in the U.S. and Europe for individuals 55 years and older, and is the third leading cause of impaired vision for those over 65. <p>
Although the condition is associated with aging, it may also partly result from nutritional deficiencies. According to medical researcher Bill Sardi, at least 8 out of 10 opthalmalogists prescribe nutritional supplements for patients with macular disease, knowing that there are sound clinical reasons why the eyes might respond to nutritional intervention. "Nutritional supplements offer the greatest hope for a cure for this debilitating problem," says Sardi.<p>
Recognizing this, Carlson Laboratories developed Eye-Rite, a nonprescription formula containing key nutrients essential for eye functions. Of specific benefit to the eyes in this formula are lutein, proanthocyanidins, and soy protein.<p>
Lutein is a yellow carotenoid pigment found naturally in kale, collards, and mustard greens, among other green leafy vegetables. It is also present in the center of the retina. A 1980 study showed that animals deprived of dietary lutein developed accelerated rates of macular disease, reports Sardi. More recently, a 1994 study showed that adults eating 3-5 weekly servings of spinach had a 43% reduced risk for macular degeneration.<p>
Other research shows that of the 3 primary risk groups for macular degeneration (smokers, postmenopausal women, and people with blue, green, and hazel eyes) each tends to have markedly lower than average lutein levels. Sardi also cites anecdotal reports from individuals with blue eyes who report their vision brighter and sharper, their color perception enhanced, and glare reduced when taking lutein supplements. Benefits usually take 6-8 weeks to become noticeable, says Sardi. "This provides compelling evidence that retinal lutein levels are involved in macular disease," he concludes.<p>
In the advanced stage of macular degeneration, blood vessels in the eye may begin hemorrhaging or new blood vessels (capillaries) form inappropriately at the back of the eyes. The nutritional antidote for weak capillaries are bioflavonoids, natural substances that enhance the activities of vitamin C. Among these is a group called proanthocyanidins, which are deep red and blue pigments, commonly found in blueberries, bilberries, cranberries, and Concord grapes. <p>
These substances work with vitamin C to strengthen the eyes' capillaries, Sardi explains. He notes that in Europe extracts from proanthocyanidins are regularly prescribed (at a minimum therapeutic dose of 120 mg daily) for macular degeneration. Carlson's Eye-Rite contains 120 mg of proanthocyanidins derived from bilberry, cranberry, and grape seed extracts.<p>
The third nutrient in this formula of benefit to the eyes is soy isoflavone concentrate, a protein component of soybeans. This ingredient addresses the nutritional needs of postmenopausal women and seeks to preempt their susceptibility to macular degeneration, Sardi says. <p>
Women who have gone through menopause have an estimated 400% increased risk for this eye condition due to diminished production of the hormone estrogen. Lowered estrogen levels lead to a reduction in HDL cholesterol. "Lutein is transported from the liver to the retina primarily on HDL cholesterol," Sardi explains. "As estrogen and HDL levels drop, the density of retinal lutein dwindles in the postmenopausal years." <p>
Soy protein is a natural (though weak) plant source of estrogen that can help maintain HDL cholesterol levels and thereby maintain proper lutein levels in the eyes. The Eye-Rite formula contains 100 mg of soy isoflavone concentrate based on a daily dosage of 2 capsules. Other beneficial nutrients in the formula include alpha-lipoic acid (an antioxidant, see  pp. 66-67), vitamins C and E, zinc, and spirulina algae.<p>

<b>THERAPEUTIC CANCER VACCINE BASED ON PLACENTAL EXTRACTS</b><p>
While the emphasis in alternative cancer treatment, in terms of understanding how cancer develops and how to reverse it, has been to strengthen a patient's presumably weakened immune system, Russian immunologist Valentin I. Govallo proposed in the late 1970s that the solution might lie elsewhere. Dr. Govallo, a physician and immunologist working in Moscow, proposed that the secret to reversing cancer might lie in disabling the immune system of the tumor itself. <p>
Dr. Govallo developed a therapeutic vaccine, now called VG-1000, based on extracts of human placentas obtained after a normal pregnancy (but never an abortion). Between 1975 and 1996, Dr. Govallo tested the vaccine on 250 patients, most of whom had supposedly incurable cancers. He reports today that more than 50% of his earliest patients have survived 10 years or more and have healthy immune systems. Typically, a patient needs only 2 injections, spaced 1 week apart, followed by a booster shot 1-2 months later.<p>
Dr. Govallo's placental vaccine, which prior to 1996 was virtually unknown outside Russia, is now available in North America at 2 alternative cancer clinics: Max Gerson Memorial Center Hospital in Tijuana, Mexico, and Immuno-Augmentative Clinic (IAT) in Freeport, Bahamas. <p>
The arrival of VG-1000 in North America was made possible by the efforts of medical historian Harris L. Coulter, Ph.D., director of the Center for Empirical Medicine in Washington, D.C. Dr. Coulter is the author of the landmark 4-volume Divided Legacy, a 3,000-page work documenting the history of and conflicts between conventional and alternative medicines. In 1994, Dr. Coulter traveled to Moscow, met with Dr. Govallo, and made arrangements to introduce VG-1000 in the West.<p>
According to Dr. Coulter, VG-1000 is indicated as "the first-line treatment" for all carcinomas (breast, prostate, and lung cancers) and melanomas, especially if they have been recently diagnosed. "It is also recommended for persons whose cancers have apparently been treated with success in the past but who are concerned about relapse." <p>
Dr. Coulter notes that patients with early stage cancers who have had their primary tumor surgically removed and who have not had either radiation or chemotherapy "respond extremely well." For those who have already had conventional treatments, a 2-month waiting period is advised before using VG-1000. <p>
The vaccine is contraindicated for liver cancer or metastases to the bones since the liver will be unable to process toxins released by the dying tumor. Generally, preliminary surgery to minimize the cancer mass is advised so that the burden on the liver to detoxify the dissolving tumor does not become formidable.<p>
The vaccine "apparently kills" the tumor by suppressing then removing its defense mechanism, says Dr. Coulter. As Dr. Govallo theorized, the tumor appears able to selectively disable the immune response of the patient in a manner similar to the way a fetus keeps its mother's immune system from rejecting it. Dr. Govallo argues that, in the early stages of a cancer, the patient's immunity may actually be normal, except that its antitumor mechanisms have been blocked by the tumor itself.<p>
By applying these immunological principles, Dr. Govallo achieved a 91% normal birth rate among women with a history of multiple miscarriages. Although the precise mode of action is not completely understood, it appears that the placental vaccine breaks through the tumor's "shield," neutralizes its blockers, and renders it vulnerable to the body's immune actions, which begin to literally soften then dissolve it, said Dr. Govallo. <p>
For example, when 2 patients with long-standing lung cancer received a VG-1000 injection, within a few days their tumors began to "melt" and be expelled in little clumps through the mouth by coughing. Patients with cancer of the colon and prostate similarly noticed strange deposits of foreign, dead matter in their stool and urine soon after having the vaccine. <p>
Dr. Coulter notes that patients often have strong reactions to the injectiontransient symptoms such as sleepiness, headaches, depression, fever, sweats, chills, pain twingeswhich indicate a positive, "curative" response. Patients tend to experience other benefits as well, such as mood elevation, pain reduction, and life extension even in cancers at the most advanced stage. Dr. Coulter notes that while there is much to be encouraged about regarding the clinical performance of VG-1000, it is still "premature" to say the substance can or cannot "cure" cancer. Patients interested in receiving VG-1000 treatment must be screened for suitability, says Dr. Coulter.<p>

<b>AID FOR DIABETES AND ITS COMPLICATIONS<br>
Versatile Antioxidant from Potatoes</b><p>
Some of the blood sugar and energy problems associated with diabetes may be relieved with a substance found principally in potatoes, but also in carrots, yams, sweet potatoes, and red meat. First identified in 1957, it's called alpha-lipoic acid (also known as thioctic acid) and while it is naturally present in the body where it assists in the conversion of foods into energy, its benefits to the body are much enhanced when it is taken as a supplement. <p>
Prominent among these benefits is the way alpha-lipoic acid can aid in diabetes. Physicians in Germany have been prescribing alpha-lipoic acid for the last 30 years to help patients with adult-onset diabetes control their blood sugar. Researchers showed that this substance, when intravenously administered at a dose of 1000 mg, can increase the uptake and utilization of blood sugar (glucose) by over 50%, thereby decreasing the dependency on the pancreatic hormone insulin to do the same job. In short, alpha-lipoic acid was able to normalize blood sugar levels.<p>
Adult-onset diabetes is often characterized by too much unutilized glucose (high blood sugar); therefore, alpha-lipoic acid shows promise for long-term management of this condition. Other studies have shown that diabetics tend to have lower than normal amounts of bodily alpha-lipoic acid and that taking supplemental alpha-lipoic acid can return these levels to normal. <p>
It can also lower insulin resistance, a condition in which the body does not react to insulin, allowing blood sugar levels to climb. Supplemen-tation at the rate of 300-600 mg daily has been shown to significantly lower blood sugar levels and increase energy storage (glycogen) and availability in muscles, liver, and the brain. Supplementation at the rate of 600 mg daily for 1 month resulted in a 55% to 72% increase in levels of 2 biochemical substances central to memory and brain energy. Alpha-lipoic acid also helps reduce glycation, the damage caused by blood sugar to protein and other important substances.<p>
Diabetics are often vulnerable to nerve damage (neuropathy) as a complication, but here, again, German research shows that those at risk who take 600 mg of alpha-lipoic acid daily can significantly reduce the symptoms of this condition, enhance regeneration of damaged nerves, and increase nerve blood flow. <p>
Alpha-lipoic acid may also be able to protect the eyes against cataracts, another common diabetic complication. Researchers at the University of California at Berkeley showed that in newborn rats with induced cataracts, a dose of 25 mg/2.5 pounds of body weight of alpha-lipoic acid protected about 60% of the rats from actual cataract formation.<p>
Alpha-lipoic acid can also protect the eyes against another condition called macular degeneration (see pp. 63-65). Here the substance demonstrates its versatility as an antioxidant, or free radical scavenger, because macular denegeration has been linked to inadequate blood levels of antioxidants. Alpha-lipoic acid is unique among antioxidants for being able to enter both the fat-soluble and water-soluble parts of the cell to neutralize free radicals. Among other antioxidants, vitamin C can address only the water-soluble and vitamin E the fat-soluble components of cells. <p>
Studies show that alpha-lipoic acid can actually penetrate eye tissue and protect both the lens and retina from degeneration. Even better, alpha-lipoic acid appears capable of regenerating vitamins C and E, coenzyme Q10, and glutathione, prolonging their antioxidant activity in the body. <p>
Further, it is an important player in an "antioxidant network" that includes vitamins C and E and glutathione and enables these 3 to function more efficiently. Alpha-lipoic acid also is a highly effective liver detoxifier, able to reverse liver damage (when administered at 800 mg in 4 divided doses) caused by ingesting poisonous mushrooms and in cases of sudden liver failure.<p>
Generally, dosages are about 50 mg daily for antioxidant benefits (based on German usage), but far higher amounts are typically used for diabetes and other conditions. Julian Whitaker, M.D., who practices in Newport Beach, California, suggests that until more is known about alpha-lipoic acid's actions, its use as a supplement, at 50-200 mg daily, should be "only for people who are under treatment for diabetes, heart disease, AIDS, and any form of serious liver disorder." <p>

 [<a href="#s01">Tahitian Noni Fruit Helps Cancer, Arthritis, PMS, Chronic Fatigue</a>]<br>
 [<a href="#s02">Garlic Helps Lower Blood Pressure ...</a>]<p>

  <hr width="90%" size="1"><p>

<a name="s01"></a>
<b>TAHITIAN FRUIT HELPS CANCER, ARTHRITIS, CHRONIC FATIGUE, PMS</b><p> 
Among the lay healers of Tahiti, the reputation of the noni fruit (Morinda citrifolia) as a medicinal food ranks high. The plant itself is found throughout French Polynesia and can grow as high as 20 feet, bearing noni fruits (pictured above) the size of potatoes. In Malaysia, it is known as Mengkudu and is used for urinary problems, coughs, and painful menstruation, while in the Caribbean, people know it as the Pain Killer Tree. People throughout the region have long used the noni fruit as a dietary staple.<p> 
Anecdotal reports suggest that juice from this fruit can be significantly helpful in numerous health conditions, such as hypertension, wounds and infections, ulcers, skin rashes, digestive disorders, colds, influenza, arthritis, and cancer. Mitchell Tate, director of the Center for Lifestyle Disease in St. George, Utah, reports using noni to prevent sore throats and bacterial infections after his family was exposed to strep infection.<p> 
Tate further reports that while researching noni at the University of Honolulu in Hawaii (noni also grows in Hawaii), he found that "a significant amount of research has been done on the plant and that most of it substantiated claims by the Tahitians."<p> 
One laboratory study showed that noni was effective as an antiseptic against 9 types of infectious bacteria; another suggested it would help lower blood pressure; and a third showed that noni produced complete remissions and increased life spans in mice injected with lung cancer. Out of 22 mice injected, 9 survived more than 50 days after receiving noni for 5 days; mice not receiving noni survived only 9-12 days.<p> 
According to principal researcher A. Hirazumi, Ph.D. (Proceedings of the Western Pharmacological Society, 1994), noni juice "seems to act indirectly by enhancing the immune system involving macrophages and/or lymphocytes [key cancer-fighting immune cells]." A Japanese research team studied the effects of 500 extracts from tropical plants in inhibiting the activity of  the K-ras-NRK cell (believed to be a cancer precursor) and found that noni performed the best (Cancer Letters, 1993). A French study (1990, published in Planta Medica) demonstrated that noni has a clinically important sedative and pain-relieving (analgesic) effect.<p>
Research by R.M. Heinicke, Ph.D., at the University of Hawaii, suggests that the active ingredient in noni is xeronine, a digestive enzyme similar to bromelain in pineapple. Dr. Heinicke emphasizes that noni must be consumed on an empty stomach, preferably upon rising in the morning, for the enzyme to become activated by the intestines.<p> 
Dr. Heinicke believes that, once activated, xeronine helps to repair damaged cells by regulating the rigidity and shape of particular proteins comprising those cells. "Since these proteins have different functions within the cells, this explains how the administration of noni juice causes a wide range of physiological responses," states Dr. Heinicke.<p>
According to testimonials published in Health News, noni juice has produced relief in individuals with arthritis, chronic fatigue, and PMS, among other conditions. John Bowers, aged 35, had suffered from ankylosing spondylitis and arthritis  for 10 years. He was disabled, only able to get around with a wheelchair or cane, in constant pain, and facing a lifetime of debilitation. Numerous conventional drug regimens and therapies failed to improve his condition over a 5-year span. Bowers states that the first night after taking noni, he slept through the night for the first time in 4 years. Taking noni at the dosage of 2 ounces daily for 2 months, his need for both cane and wheelchair was nearly eliminated and he was able to get about on his own.<p>
Colleen Abbott, aged 55, had suffered with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) for 20 years. A variety of nutritional supplements had improved her symptoms but not eliminated them. A recent accident injured her back, leaving her in pain, almost immobile, and on painkillers. Colleen reports that after taking noni for 3 days, she was able to "get up, walk, and climb stairs without crawling." Her sleep improved, her pain and most of her CFS symptoms went away, and instead of needing chiropractic adjustments twice daily, she had them only once a month.<p> 
Noni appears able to correct PMS and menstrual problems, according to Vicki Morgan. She reports that she always had severe cramps 5 days before her period and during the first few days of bleeding; although she followed a nutritional program for 6 years, her menstrual problems remained. Taking noni regularly eliminated her PMS cramping and reduced the cramping during bleeding.<p>
According to Morinda, the product's manufacturer, about 25% of the users of noni experience a noticeable difference after using the drink for 3 weeks, while 50% notice benefits after 3-8 weeks of daily use. Mitchell Tate suggests a daily dosage of 2 tablespoons for general health maintenance, but 3-4 tablespoons daily for an existing health condition.<p>

<b>GARLIC IS GOOD FOR YOUR HEART<br>
Lowers Blood Pressure and Cholesterol</b><p>
While garlic has been used for centuries in traditional cultures throughout the world as a multipurpose medicinal food, in recent decades more than 2,000 clinical studies have validated many of the folk healing claims for "the stinking rose," as garlic was once called. Promi-nent among these substantiated claims is garlic's ability to lower blood pressure, inhibit cholesterol production, promote blood circulation, and discourage clot formation.<p>
In a Chinese study, 70 patients with clinically diagnosed high blood pressure took garlic oil for several weeks. At the end of the study, 35 registered a "marked" lowering of their blood pressure, while another 14 subjects experienced "moderate" drops. <p>
Garlic liquid extract that has been aged for at least 1 year appears to produce better results than fresh raw garlic. A Bulgarian study on cats showed that fresh garlic juice produced only a "slight and temporary" decrease, while aged garlic extract produced more significant and sustained drops in blood pressure. <p>
Garlic can not only lower high blood pressure, but apparently elevate low blood pressure as well, leading researchers to propose that its true effect is normalizing blood pressure. <p>
Garlic may also lower cholesterol and appears to produce this effect by slowing down the synthesis of cholesterol by the liver in the first place. In a study published in Atherosclerosis, 20 patients with elevated levels of lipoproteins (a protein-fat compound) took garlic for 4 weeks. At the end of the period, all subjects showed a 10% drop in blood pressure and blood cholesterol levels. Researchers studying a vegetarian community in India found that those who consumed "liberal" amounts of garlic (and onions) had an average of 25% lower cholesterol levels than those who did not. <p>
A study directed by Benjamin H.S. Lau, M.D., Ph.D., of the School of Medicine at Loma Linda University in Loma Linda, California, studied the effect of garlic supplementation on 32 subjects with high cholesterol. During the 6-month study, subjects took 4 capsules daily of liquid garlic extract, after which time cholesterol levels had returned to normal in 65% of the participants. More specifically, levels of HDL cholesterol (believed to protect the heart) rose steadily, while levels of LDL cholesterol (believed to harm the heart) steadily dropped. <p>
Garlic has also been shown to promote blood circulation, both peripheral (to the hands and feet) and "microcirculation" (into the tiniest capillaries). It can also interrupt the harmful tendency of the platelets and fibrin in the blood to form clots, a condition associated with heart attacks and stroke. Researchers reported in the Journal of the American College of Nutrition (October 1994) the results of a clinical study involving 45 men, aged 30-70, with high cholesterol levels. Of this group, 66% received "beneficial effects" in these levels and platelet activity after taking garlic extract at 700 mg, 9 times daily for 6 months. The result was "cardiovascular risk reduction." <p>
Yu-Yan Yeh, Ph.D., of the Department of Nutrition at Pennsylvania State University reviewed extensive multi-laboratory studies on garlic's ability to reduce cardiovascular disease and concluded: "Collectively, the results suggest that garlic may lower the risk for this disease by reducing plasma lipids, lowering blood pressure, and depressing platelet adhesion and aggregation [clotting]." <p>
According to Brenda Lynn Petesch, nutritionist with Wakunaga of America Co., Ltd., manufacturers of Kyolic Aged Garlic Extract, garlic can prevent the spread of smooth muscle cells in blood vessels that would otherwise further the progression of heart disease. Petesch also notes that a recent Australian study showed that garlic extract "may afford protection against the onset of atherosclerosis [hardening of the arteries]." <p>
Finally, with respect to existing heart conditions, dietary garlic may reduce the risk of having a second heart attack as well as the general risk of dying from heart disease. Over a study period of 3 years, regular use of garlic reduced the rate of repeat heart attack by 30% in the second year and by 60% in the third year based on a group of 432 subjects. Researchers proposed that garlic's benefit is cumulative, building with continuous use. <p>

<b>CANCER TREATMENT<br>
Interest in Alternative Approaches Is Rising</b><p>
Confidence in the efficacy of alternative medicine as a treatment option for cancer is growing impressively. The American Cancer Society estimated in 1993 that 9% of U.S. cancer patients use complementary therapies, although other researchers placed the figures higherat 10% to 60%. <p>
A study undertaken at New York Hospital in 1994 revealed that about 30% of breast cancer patients polled said they had consulted an alternative practitioner while 25% were currently receiving some form of "unconventional" therapy such as shark cartilage, medicinal mushrooms, Chinese herbs, or vitamin injections.<p>
Yet another study in Cancer (1991) estimated that anywhere from 10% to 50% of cancer patients try some form of alternative or complementary care; the same study reported that 5% of cancer patients abandon conventional treatment in favor of alternative approaches. The U.S. government estimates that in 1992 the public spent $2 billion on alternative cancer treatments. 	<p>
Based on the most conservative estimate that 10% of U.S. cancer patients consult alternative practitioners every year, this means that at least 100,000 cancer patients are under alternative care or using alternative substances as part of a cancer treatment program.<p>
The trend toward incorporating more alternative practices in cancer care is growing worldwide. A 1994 survey (published in the British Medical Journal) of 415 cancer patients in 2 London hospitals indicated that 16% had used alternative therapies for cancer. Among the most popular modalities used were relaxation, visualization, diet, homeopathy, vitamins, and herbs. The average user of these alternative therapies was 50, married, and female; 82% were either "satisfied" or "very satisfied" with the therapies, describing the benefits as both physical and psychological.<p>
A 1994 study at the Women's and Children's Hospital in South Australia (published in The Medical Journal of Australia) showed that about 46% of children, aged 4-16, with cancer had received at least one alternative treatment and that fewer than 50% of the children's parents discussed their use of alternative methods with their conventional doctors. Among the preferred modalities were positive imagery (17%), hypnotherapy (15%), relaxation exercises (10%), diet (8%), and multivitamins (8%). Of the children's parents, 83% stated that there were no side effects.<p>
According to the European Journal of Oncology (October 1995), of 630 cancer patients in Norway, 20% had been or were currently users of alternative therapies (called "non-proven therapies" in the survey) for their cancer. Among the most popular methods were therapeutic touch, herbs, vitamins, diet, and Iscador (an injectable remedy from mistletoe). Up to 40% of these patients had used alternative therapies for other illnesses prior to developing cancer.<p>
In the Netherlands, of 949 oncology outpatients polled at several hospitals, 9% said they were presently using alternative medicine in addition to conventional approaches. Of the patients with lymphatic cancer at the Center of Oncology in Krakow, Poland, 25% had received alternative therapies prior to admission. In Germany, out of 160 cancer patients, 53% said they had used alternative medicine at some point in their medical history.<p>

<b>BOTANICALS ARE BIG!<br>
Sales of Natural Herbal Products Climb</b><p>
The new annual survey of natural herbal products sales by Whole Foods magazine shows "strong growth" for herbs. For the average  store, with yearly sales of about $800,000, herbal products represent 27% while herbal body care and cosmetics pull in 6%. <p>
Retailers responding to Whole Foods' survey said their 1996 overall herbal products sales were up 32% over the previous year, while sales of herbal supplements alone have grown by 7.8%. Among the biggest selling herbs are Echinacea (representing 9.6% of all herbal sales), garlic (7.2%), followed by ginseng, Ginkgo biloba, and goldenseal; together these 5 account for 33% of all herbal supplement sales. In sixth place is Mu Huang (ephedra), followed by Siberian ginseng, psyllium, saw palmetto, and Cascara sagrada; these 5 represent 16.7% of dollars spent on herbal products. The top 10 herbs captured 49.7% of U.S. herbal sales, says Whole Foods.<p>
Regarding how Americans are using their herbs, Whole Foods reports that 50% take them in capsules, 18% as tablets, 11% as teas, 13% as extracts or tinctures, but only 5.4% as bulk herbs. When asked what obstacles were preventing even stronger herb sales, 41% of U.S. herbal products retailers attribute it to lack of consumer education; for 23%, it is government restrictions on consumer information; and for 18%, it is "scare stories" about herbs in the mainstream media. <p>
In other words, direct political interference by official opponents of herbal products accounts for 41% of the public's resistance to herbs. Only 2% said price was a factor and only 10% considered lack of product standardization or manufacturer promotions to be factors.<p>

<b>59% OF CANADIANS USE ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE</b><p>
According to a poll of 2,629 residents, conducted in June 1996 by the Richmond Regional Health Board in Richmond, British Columbia (Canada), 59.4% said they have tried "complementary" or alternative health therapies, including chiropractic, acupuncture, massage, and aromatherapy. The majority of the respondents (59%) were aged 31-50; 75% were women.<p>
Even more impressive, 86.3% say they are in favor of having alternative therapies at least partially funded by Canada's Medical Services Plan, while 88.6% of Richmond residents want to see a "Complementary Health Therapies Center" established in their community. Among Chinese residents, 46.1% have used complementary therapies, as have 44.7% of hospital workers and 61% of employees of the Workers' Compensation Board.  <p>
Of those individuals dissatisfied with Canadian Medicare services,  78% had used alternative therapies. Among modalities, the category of vitamins and supplements was the most often used, by 37% of respondents; 30% had used chiropractic; 29% massage, 17% naturopathy, and 14% acupuncture. <p>
For those who had not accessed an alternative therapy, lack of knowledge of the therapy's benefits followed by cost considerations were the main reasons, the Richmond poll revealed. Among hospital workers, however, 24% (compared to only 8.8% among all 2,629 respondents) gave as a prime reason their lack of belief in the benefits of the therapies. <p>
"This finding is consistent with the literature," the Richmond Health Board "Information Report" summary stated. "Those involved in the provision of [conventional] medical services are less likely to explore alternative health therapies."<p>
The Information Report also summarized data on alternative medicine from other studies. A 1996 survey found that 41% of Canadians aged 55-64 and 43% of those aged 65 and older were "ready to consider" an alternative therapy. Of Ontario general practitioners, an estimated 55% to 71% regard one or more alternative therapies as "useful," but in Alberta it is 77% and in Quebec, 83%; 44% of Alberta physicians, 52% of Ontario doctors, and 77% of those in Quebec referred patients for complementary health-care services.<p>
Another survey of British Columbia residents conducted in 1995 by the Angus Reid Group indicated that 72% of those polled said they were "interested" in alternative medicine. Of these, young- to middle-aged women of lower to middle income represented the majority. The survey also found that 89% would patronize an alternative medicine clinic.<p>

<b>31% OF AMERICANS LEFT OUT IN THE COLD,<br>
Despite $1 Trillion for U.S. Health Care</b><p>
With the annual cost of U.S. health care topping $1 trillion, 31% of Americans are  still either uninsured or have difficulty in paying for medical services. In a nation that spends this much money on health care, leaving 31% of our population out in the cold is absurd, shameful, and inexcusable.<p>
Harvard University researchers polled 3,993 Americans by telephone in 1995 and found that 17 million insured and 17 million uninsured Americans alike have financial problems in receiving needed medical care; about 30 million report they have difficulty in paying their medical bills; and 45% of the uninsured and 11% of those with health insurance said they had trouble in the previous year getting the medical attention they needed. <p>
Some 70% of the uninsured rated their medical symptoms as either "somewhat serious" or "very serious" at the time when they were unable to afford adequate medical care. Of those uninsured who had problems receiving medical care, 75% rated their health status as "poor." <p>
The researchers found that only 37% of those uninsured were able to receive medical care for free, at a reduced charge, or as part of charity care. This data shattered the common assumption that the sick and indigent could always get free medical care somehow, stated study director Karen Donelan of Harvard's School of Public Health. "The sickest people surveyed are most likely to have problems getting the medical care they need." <p>
The majority (53%) of uninsured adults have difficulty in obtaining or paying for proper health care, she added. In fact, more people (44%) received calls from collection agencies over unpaid bills than received free care (37%). Among the uninsured are 9.8 million children, or about 13.8% of all U.S. children. That is the national average, but in 7 states that number exceeds 20%.<p>
The main reason (55%) given for the uninsured not having health insurance is that it is simply too expensive, the study said. One of the prime reasons for this excessive expense, in the Digest's opinion, is the government-enforced virtual monopoly of U.S. health care by conventional medicine and its rigid emphasis on expensive drugs, surgery, and high- technology interventions. <p>
Perhaps this is why in 1993 the World Health Organization (WHO) ranked the U.S. 18th among developed nations in terms of "good health." WHO noted that one of the prime reasons for this superior showing by other countries (all of whom spend less per capita for health care) is their "pluralistic approach" to health-care delivery, meaning their willingness to allow conventional and alternative therapies to thrive (and compete openly) side by side in the medical marketplace.<p>

<b>RADIATION THERAPY SPEEDS UP PROSTATE CANCER DOUBLING TIME<br>
Media Ignores Facts</b><p>
According to the Cancer Communication Newsletter, mainstream television media are dangerously misrepresenting conventional medical procedures for prostate cancer, including radiation, by not disclosing the serious side effects. <p>
Radiation therapyimplanting radiation seeds in the prostate glandroutinely given for early signs of prostate cancer can actually hasten the development of that cancer. Prostate cancer cells can double in as little as 1.2 months after radiation treatment while unradiated prostate cancer cells may take an average of 4 years to double. Similarly, it will take up to 20 years for the average untreated prostate cell to double 5 times but if treated with radiation therapy, it can double 5 times in only 6 months40 times faster. <p>
Meanwhile, despite these facts or perhaps unaware of them, urologists send thousands of patients with suspected prostate cancer to radiation therapists every year. According to medical statistics culled from Urological Nursing, Family Urology, and other sources, and published in the Cancer Communication Newsletter, about 30-40% of men in their 50s have signs of prostate cancer, but of these, only about 8% will ever feel the effect of this disease in their lifetime, and less than 3% will die from it. <p>
Yet if a man in his 50s has an elevated prostate specific antigen (PSA, a standard prostate cancer marker) and undergoes prostate surgery, he has a 20% risk of the following scenario happening: The surgery can actually release cancer cells into the blood, and from 6 months to 5 years later, he will again have an elevated PSA, indicating cancer. <p>
Research reported in Family Urology indicates that while 50% of male radiation patients may experience a drop in their PSA, it is sustained in only 20%; this means only 10% of the total radiation patients have a sustained decline in PSA. It also means that about 90% are likely to have cancer cells that, owing to radiation, now double 40 times faster than unradiated prostate cells. <p>
The point is brought more keenly home by realizing that for the man who initially had a 92% likelihood of having no ill effects from latent prostate cancer, now, as a result of surgery or radiation treatment, is likely to become incontinent or impotent, and have to deal with a rapidly growing cancer. <p>

<b>INSURERS TO COVER ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE<br>
Cost Savings and Consumer Demand Show Insurers Why</b><p>
With annual revenues of $3 billion, Oxford Health Plans of Norwalk, Con-necticut, has set up a 1,000-practitioner provider network for alternative therapies, enabling its premium holders to consult with and be reimbursed for visits to alternative providers. The program started on a trial basis for policy holders in New York, Connecticut, and New Jersey. <p>
For an additional 3% added on to their premiums, those holding policies with Oxford may now be reimbursed for visits to chiropractors, acupuncturists, naturopaths, massage therapists, and yoga instructors, provided they are on Oxford's list of 1,000. Oxford plans to expand coverage soon to include reflexology, t'ai chi, hypnotherapy, meditation, and other body energy approaches. <p>
According to Oxford's senior vice president, David B. Snow, a survey by the company of its 1.4 million members revealed that 33% had used alternative health care in 1995. "This is not fad stuff we're talking about."<p>
Stephen Wiggins, chairman,  chief executive of Oxford, and a personal enthusiast of holistic medicine, says that strong consumer demand (as indicated by Oxford's survey) and unarguable cost savings (most alternative therapies cost less than conventional treatments) are compelling reasons to try this new approach. <p>
In fact, Wiggins believes that if an insurance company ignores consumer demand, it does so at its peril. Oxford's decision to go with alternative care reimbursement was "a recognition of the obvious trend: the demand by consumers to seek an alternative to conventional Western medical solutions."<p>
This makes Oxford the first U.S. insurance company to form a network of alternative practitioners which, incidentally, mirrors its existing network of 33,000 conventional physicians. While other insurersAmerican Western Life, Kaiser Permanente, Blue Cross/Blue Shield, Mutual of Omaha, Prudentialoffer limited coverage of some alternative specialties, they have not established a formal holistic provider network such as Oxford's.  <p>
Why are more insurers willing to pick up the tab for alternative medicine? According to Alan Kittner of Complementary HealthCare, a consulting firm in San Francisco, California, "Insurers are beginning to cover alternative treatments in order to differentiate themselves from their competitors and appeal to this public demand." <p>
In the Digest's view, when alternative therapies are allowed to compete openly and fairly in the health-care marketplace, their ability to satisfy public demand and provide huge cost savings alone will establish them as the predominant approach to medicine. <p>

<b>&quot;SCENTED OIL&quot; MONOI TAHITIAN COSMETICS</b><p> 
For centuries, Tahitians have used a multi-purpose natural cosmetic formula called Monoi to keep their skin from dehydrating under the tropical conditions of strong, continuous sunlight. Tahitians and other Polynesians reportedly used this formula to protect their bodies from the elements during the long oceanfaring expeditions of an earlier age. According to Tahitian lore, newborn infants were covered with Monoi from head to toe to protect against dehydration during especially hot weather.<p>
Today, Monoi based on this traditional Tahitian formula is available in the U.S. as part of a body-care line that includes bath and shower gels, tanning lotions, skin balm, moisturizer, body cream, and a beauty bar soap. According to the manufacturer, Monoi and Cosmetics, all products are chemical free and no animal testing is involved; in addition, in 1992, the French government awarded Monoi a special certification called "Guarantee of Origin," given only to products the government considers "superior" and of the "finest quality."<p>
The essence of the Monoi products is a combination of tiare flowers and oil from the fruit of the Tumu ha'ari tree (a variety of coconut), both native to Polynesia. According to the manufacturer, tiare flowers (Gardenia Tahitensis, a 6-petalled highly fragrant white blossom) are handpicked and immediately soaked in refined coconut oil (from native coconuts, refined without chemicals) for at least 15 days. <p>
"Laboratory tests show that the tiare flower has over 150 botanical attributes and acts as a natural barrier against dehydration," states a company representative. Customer testimonials collected by the company suggest that in addition to helping to produce soft and supple skin, the Monoi products have certain medicinal benefits such as reducing the symptoms of rashes, hair damage, and heel cracking, while aiding nail growth.<p>
The traditional Monoi recipe, reportedly still used, specifies a minimum of 15 tiare flowers per liter of refined coconut oil. During the extraction process (called enfleurage), the botanical and hydrating qualities of the tiare flower (and its perfume) are gradually released into the coconut oil, thereby constituting the basis of Monoi ("scented oil") products. The Monoi extract is then filtered and blended with other ingredients, such as vitamin E, aloe vera, African shea tree nut butter, or apricot oil to create the various body-care applications.<p>
According to an informal evaluation of selected Monoi products by a holistic practitioner known to the Digest, the Tahiti Smooth Shower Gel (which can be used instead of soap), "the skin-softening effect can be felt immediately, yet it is not a greasy sensation. The gel leaves a light, delicate, and pleasant fragrance yet it is not so overpowering as to dominate any perfumes or other scents used. The Pure Nurturing Body Cream has similar qualities, based on my experience with it."<p>

<b>GOOD HERBS FOR CLEANSING YOUR FACE</b><p>
An herbal face mask can draw toxins out of your skin while improving blood circulation to your face. Here is an herbal face mask from Chinese herb expert Andrew Gaeddert. He recommends mixing the following ingredients:<p>
<ul>
 <li>clay, 1 tablespoon<br>
 <li>water, 2 tablespoons<br>
 <li>clear honey, 1/2 teaspoon<br>
 <li>lavender oil, 1 drop<br>
 <li>geranium oil, 1 drop<br>
</ul>
Apply the mixture to your face; if your skin is dry, remove after 10 minutes; if oily, allow it to remain longer. To remove the mask, wipe your face with a cotton ball, presoaked in warm water.<p>
Here are simple ways to cleanse and moisturize your skin, based on a traditional Japanese method, according to skin-care expert Michelle Dominique Leigh:<p>
<ul>
 <li>Use your fingers to rub camellia tree oil on your face, then remove the oil using a gauze pad.<p>
 <li>Massage your face with a small cotton drawstring bag containing pure rice bran, presoaked in warm water. Rinse, then pat your face dry with silk.<p>
 <li>Apply loofah-vine water (made from the fresh sap of the loofah-vine plant, mixed with a tiny amount of sake as a preservative) by gently patting it on the face after washing; do not rinse it off; alternatively, use diluted brown rice vinegar.<p>
 <li>Grate a fresh cucumber and extract its juice by squeezing it through cheesecloth; apply the liquid to your face, then pat dry.<p>
 <li>Mix dry adzuki bean powder in a small silken or cotton bag, moisten, then use to scrub your face. Or, mix a little adzuki bean powder in the palm of your hand with water, then massage your face with the frothy cream.<p>
</ul>

<b>TIPS FOR CREATING HEALTHY SKIN</b><p>
Like any other system of the body, the skin needs care, especially the skin of your face which receives the most exposure to the environment. In addition to dietary considerations and supplements that build health from the inside out, there are steps you can take to care for your skin on the outside, too. Zia Wesley-Hosford, founder of Educated Beauty, a natural cosmetics and skin-care company, and author of Fifty and Fabulous, recommends the following daily "skin-care rituals" to keep your skin healthy and vibrant.<p> 
In the morning:<p>
<ul>
 <li><i>Cleanse and Exfoliate</i>. "Morning exfoliation [removing dead skin cells] is one of the most beneficial things you can do for aging skin and for repairing skin damage," says Wesley-Hosford. She suggests an exfoliating mask with clay, but says a facial cleanser can also be used. Cleansers should be matched to skin type (normal, oily, dry, or combination) and cleansing accomplished by massaging the face with the cleanser from bottom to top with circular motions of the fingertip pads for 1 minute, then splashing the face 20 to 30 times with warm water. Wesley-Hosford cautions that hot water dries out the skin. <p>
 <li>Treat the Eyes. Since the skin around the eyes cannot produce oil the way other skin can and is the thinnest on the body, it is the first place to show signs of age. Wesley-Hosford advises using a water-soluble moisturizer, particularly oxygenated, enzymatic, or liposome products because of their ability to penetrate the skin. Liposomes are composed of phospholipids (fats) which are a natural component of skin cells. The similarity in the cell membrane of liposomes and skin cells allows liposome to penetrate skin more deeply than other substances applied topically. <p>
   "Liposomes might be said to slip into the 'empty spaces' in the skin caused by dehydration and free-radical damage," explains Wesley-Hosford. "Once there, they 'melt' and release their contents of lipids slowly over a period of about 10 to 12 hours." Generally derived from the lecithin in egg yolks, liposomes are a relatively new addition to skin-care products. <p>
   To apply moisturizer to the eye area, use your middle finger, moving from the outside inward to keep from stretching the eye muscle. Avoid the inner corner of the eye since that is where the tear ducts are.<p>
 <li><i>Tone the Skin</i>. A facial skin toner "tightens the skin, helps reestablish the skin's pH after cleansing, protects, and nourishes." Toner can be applied with the fingertips or with a cotton ball. A spray toner can also be used and, in that case, massage the toner into the skin with the fingertips. <p>
 <li><i>Moisturize Your Face</i>. Wesley-Hosford recommends using a facial moisturizer containing "predigested oils." These products can penetrate skin that is not wet. Previously, skin had to be damp for moisturizers to penetrate. <p>
 <li><i>Screen Out the Sun</i>. Sunblocks should be matched to your skin type. Those with normal, oily, or combination skin will do best with an oil-free product. Those with dry skin should use an oil-based sunblock. Wesley-Hosford emphasizes the importance of using a sunblock whenever it is sunny outside and choosing one that has both UVA and UVB protection. She recommends an SPF (sun protection factor) of 15 to 18. Rather than rubbing the block into the skin, which reduces its protection factor by about half, "lay" the lotion on evenly, letting it "sit" on the skin. Waterproof sunblocks can clog pores and are therefore not advised. <p>
</ul>
At night:<p>
<ul>
 <li><i>Cleanse</i>. Cleansing is important at the end of the day to remove whatever dirt and toxins may have accumulated. Follow the same procedure as the morning cleanse.<p>
 <li><i>Rejuvenate</i>. "Nighttime is the perfect time to help your skin regenerate because this is the time when skin cells renew themselves most actively," says Wesley-Hosford. However, she cautions against heavy creams. Recommended nighttime facial rejuvenators are vitamin A, E, and C elixirs, oxygenating moisturizers, and those that contain natural alphyhydroxy or betahydroxy acids. <p>
 <li><i>Moisturize</i> (optional). If no nighttime rejuvenator is used, it is advisable to use a moisturizer after cleansing. <p>

<b>NATURAL COSMETICS ARE PREFERRED, SAY CONSUMERS</b><p>
When the FDA's Office of Cosmetics and Colors conducted a nationwide consumer poll in 1992 to find out how American consumers regard the claim "natural" regarding cosmetics, 72% of the 1,800 respondents rated it as "very important." The survey also revealed that 49.4% said product claims for "natural" should mean a product is "all natural" and 23% said this claim can be stretched to mean a product is "mostly natural." 4.9% said the claim has no meaning or is purely an advertising ploy.<p>

 <i>The Boldest of the New Books of Alternative Medicine</i><p>

 <font size="+1"><b>Nuclear Radiation and Cancer</b></font><br>
 <b><i>Compromised Immunity and Breast Cancer</i></b><p>
</center>

Since the first atomic bomb explosion in New Mexico in 1945 and the advent of nuclear "power," nearly all of the continental United States has been irradiated by nuclear fallout. Today, 1,321 of the total 3,053 counties in the U.S. are nuclear counties, meaning the residents live within 100 miles of a reactor. In other words, more than 33% of those living in the continental U.S. are regularly exposed to nuclear radiation. These residents suffer higher than average rates of breast cancer, AIDS, and other immune deficiencies, and, among infants, premature births, low birth weights, reduced intelligence, and depressed thyroids.<p>
A former employee of the Environmental Protection Agency, Jay M. Gould bases his conclusions on meticulous research he compiled from data from the National Cancer Institute, state health departments, and the Centers for Disease Control. This data reveals that more than 1.5 million American women have died of breast cancer since the start of the "nuclear age" whereas prior to 1945, the rate of breast cancer incidence was actually declining. <p>
The exposure of an entire generationBaby Boomers born between 1945 and 1965, the height of nuclear testingto man-made fission products has led to an unprecedented increase in illness, says Gould. The toxic situation is even worse in heavy rainfall areasEast coast, Great Lakes, the Northwestwhere nuclear radiation combines with chemical pesticides, industrial pollutants, and other environmental toxins in rain. This deadly amalgam enters surface water reservoirs, public drinking water, and thus the human body faster. <p>
That the New York metropolitan area (including Long Island and southern Connecticut) has the country's greatest concentration of breast cancer mortality is directly attributable to its proximity to 4 nuclear facilities (including Brookhaven National Laboratory) and the deadly confluence of environmental factors cited above, says Gould. Here the breast cancer death rates are as high as 32 per 100,000 compared to 28 in the irradiated Northeast, an average 25.8 for nuclear counties, and 22 in nonnuclear counties. "This means that in the 'nuclear' counties for every 100,000 women, there are nearly 4 more deaths today than in nonnuclear countiesan extraordinarily significant difference," Gould says.<p>
Gould marshals a huge body of health statistics to prove conclusively that those who live in proximity to active nuclear power stations or research facilities (which release radioactive gases, toxic liquid, and solid wastes) have far higher rates of disease than those who do not. The 1,321 nuclear counties account for more than 50% of all breast cancer deaths, says Gould. He also notes that the 14 counties that house the 7 oldest nuclear reactors (maintained by the Department of Energy) had a 37% increase in breast cancer deaths between 1950 and 1989, compared to only 1% for all of the U.S.<p>
Gould's research demonstrates convincingly that negative health effects such as breast cancer mortality are directly related to residential proximity to nuclear radiation. There has been an "overall decline in the health of all age-groups," says Gould, and this cannot be explained without "taking into consideration the great environmental changes" produced by the use of nuclear power. The true cost of winning World War II with nuclear power, says Gould, has been "an uncontrollable epidemic rise in radiation-induced illnesses and in the costs of medical care."<p>
For example, not many people know that in 1945, the Hanford nuclear weapons facility in Washington State accidentally released an amount of radioactive iodine into the U.S. atmosphere equivalent to the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster. As a result, 150 million Americans were exposed to the fallout of the nuclear cloud as it drifted across the country. <p>
Since 1945, 184 atmospheric nuclear bombs have been detonated over Nevada, a fire power equal to 15,000 Hiroshima bombs; clouds containing nuclear fallout from these explosions have drifted over nearly all of the continental U.S. Combined fallout from all above-ground nuclear testing by the U.S. and the former U.S.S.R. is estimated to be equivalent to 40,000 Hiroshima bombs.<p>
"The true health effects of ingesting man-made fission products have been withheld from the public for nearly half a century," says Gould. He criticizes mainstream media for ignoring the current large number of class action suits by victims of radiation releases against nuclear facilities. Gould also lambasts the National Cancer Institute's myopic (or willful) distortion of the data in their 1990 report that failed to find any convincing links between radiation exposure and cancer.<p>
"We must press for an end to the production of nuclear weapons and operation of nuclear reactors which destroy the health and economic future of our nation," urges Gould. <p>

	<blockquote>

Josef M. Issels, MD, has become internationally known for his remarkable rate of long-term remissions of &quot;incurable cancers.&quot; His treatment also significantly reduced the incidences of relapse after surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy.
<p>

In 1951 Dr. Issels founded the first hospital in Europe for comprehensive immunotherapy of cancer.  He was the Medical Director and Director of Research.  In 1970 the hospital was enlarged from 80 to 120 patient beds.  It was also comprised of extensive research facilities including immunological and microbiological laboratories.  The research program included research on tumor vaccines, mycoplasma, hyperpyrexia, hyperthemia, etc.  Ninety percent of the patients treated at the hospital had exhausted standard cancer treatment.

<p>

From 1981 until his retirement in 1987, Dr. Issels served as an expert member of, and advisor to, the Commission of the German Federal Government in the Fight Against Cancer.
<p>

Dr. Issels presented many papers to national and international medical congresses and within programs of continuing education.  He also published three monographs.
<p>

In 1987 Dr. Issels retired from clinical responsibilities.  He is now a private consultant.

<br>
<font color="#000090" size="+1">Dr. Issels' Concept of the Development of the Cancer Disease and It's Treatment</font>

<blockquote>

<p>

Pre-and postnatal endogenous and exogenous causal factors can lead by mutagenic, toxic, sensitizing or neural effects via the transit mesenchyme to secondary damage to organs and organ systems and so to functional disturbances of the neural, hormonal, excretory and defense systems.
<p>

These secondary damages and especially the disturbance of the detoxification system deteriorate the endogenous environment , or &quot;milieu&quot;, and can lead to complex metabolic disturbances which are common to all chronic disease and cancer.
<p>

Further constant influence of the causal factors and the persistence of secondary damages can produce a functional imbalance.  Depending on constitution and disposition, this can develop into a &quot;tumor-milieu,&quot; the ideal medium for cancer cells and cancer micro-organisms to grow.
<p>

With the manifestation of the tumor, the cancer disease enters the recognizable phase.  At this time, conventional cancer treatment begins with the weapons directed against the cancer tumor and cancer cells.
<p>

According to the concept that cancer starts as a locally confined growth, all measures concentrated on the tumor alone seem causal and exhaustive.
<p>

Treating the tumor alone is not treating the condition that is producing it: the underlying cancer disease. Consequently, there is a high rate of relapse.
<p>

According to the comprehensive concept, however, cancer is considered a systemic disease from the onset and the tumor as its late stage symptom.
<p>

Following this concept Dr. Issels' therapy has two lines of approach which are of equal importance and complement each other.
<p>

<ol>
	<li>A non-specific basic therapy aiming to eliminate the causal factors, repair damages of the early stages, normalize the internal milieu, and restore the immune and repair functions.

	<li>A specific therapy directed against the tumor itself, such as surgery, radiation, chemo/hormone therapy, hyperthermia, and cancer vaccines.
</ol>
<p>

The non-specific basic therapy corresponds with the pathological path leading to the immuno-insufficiency and the cancer disease.  It is modified to suit the individual patient's needs.  It consists of:
<p>

<ul>

	<li>Elimination of causal factors, such as head foci of infection including dental, alveolar and tonsillar foci, malnutrition, abnormal intestinal flora, fields of disturbance, physical and chemical exogenous factors, endogenous and psychological factors.
<p>

	<li>Desensitization of the organism which has been sensitized by causal factors by administration of autohemolysates and colloids.
	<p>

	<li>Treatment of secondary damages, metabolic disturbances, the impaired detoxification and the resulting defense weakness, by general measures, such as hyperpyrexia or fever therapy, oxygen therapy, enzyme-therapy, neural-therapy and organ-therapy, as well as substitution according to individual requirements.
</ul>

<p>

The basic therapy is a long-term one without any toxic side effects and aims at the regeneration of the &quot;big resistance,&quot; which comprises all the defense zones:
<p>

<ol>
	<li>The extracorporal zone consisting of the physiological obligatory microflora which is responsible for the basic immunity of the organism.
<p>

	<li>The epithelial zone consisting of all epithelial surfaces which performs defense, filtration, excretion and absorption.
<p>

	<li>The lympho-reticulo defense zone which performs the important tasks of phagocytosis, antibody production and detoxification.  On this zone, immunotherapy is mainly centered today.
<p>

		<li>The reticulo-histiocytary zone, which has been neglected in cancer therapy and research, is the pluripotent mesenchyme embracing almost half of the body weight.  It is of great importance to all defensive processes with its various functions:
<p>
	<ul type=disc>
		<li>the stemcell function;
		<li>the transit function that intervenes between all nerves, organ cells, blood, lymphatic and intestinal cells;
		<li>the homeostatic function;
		<li>the defense, detoxification and storage functions.
	</ul>
</ol>

<p>

These defense zones are successive, are closely interrelated and are under neuro-hormonal control.
<p>

The blockade of only one function of one of these zones for example of the excretion, or even the blockade of the control system such as the autonomous nervous system may contribute indirectly to a lowering of the defense potential.  During treatment, it was repeatedly observed that by the elimination of head foci, or with a fever therapy a blockade of the neuro-hormonal functions was broken.
<p>

Even in an advanced state of malignant disease an immune reaction with complete tumor remission can be reached.
<p>

A system of monitoring regulative functions on a day by day basis is an essential tool to determine the effectiveness of the treatment.  Therefore, during his 40 years of experience at the sickbed, Dr. Issels developed a system to enable optimum individualized application of the treatment modalities.
<p>

For the first time Dr. Issels' method and vaccines are now available on the North American Continent.

	An independent statistical study by A.G. Audier, M.D., University of Leiden, Holland &quot;Immunotherapie Metastasierender Malignome&quot; Die Medizinische 1959, NO. 40, pp. 1860-64, reported a 16.6% cure rate of histologically verified metastatic malignomas by the Issels comprehensive immunotherapy.  The study comprised 252 patients with various cancers after all conventional methods were exhausted (World wide cure rate is 2%).
	<p>

	Josef M. Issels, M.D. reported in &quot;Immunotherapy in Progressive Metastatic Cancer, A Fifteen Year Survival Follow-up&quot; Clinical Trials Journal (London) 1970. 7, NO. 3, pp. 357-366, that of 370 patents with various cancers who were given immunological treatment shortly after surgery or irradiation, 322 (87%) were alive and well after five years without relapse or detectable metastases.  A restoration of the immune functions can reduce the incidence of relapse from about 50% (World Statistic) to 13% by combined conventional treatments and comprehensive immunotherapy.
	<p>

	John Anderson, M.D., Teaching Professor at King's College Hospital, London, reported 17% cures of histologically verified metastatic malignomas by the Issels comprehensive immunotherapy.  The independent randomized study comprised 570 patients with various cancers after all conventional methods were exhausted (General Practitioner, March 1971, pp. 15-16, London).

Alternative therapies from around the world coupled with the latest research make this an invaluable guide to surviving and controlling autoimmune diseases.<p>

Headaches--whether it's a migraine, tension, sinus, cluster, trauma, eyestrain, allergy-sensitivity, or any of 12 different types covered in this book--can be eliminated for good.<p>

Dr. Devi Nambudripad, director of the Pain Clinic in Buena Park, California, presents a revolutionary allergy elimination technique to permanently remove allergies.<p>

Other techniques have you avoid the source of allergies, but Dr. Nambudripad does away with this entirely, based on discoveries in acupuncture and chiropractic. Once your body is trained to stop reacting allergically, you'll never be bothered again by the food, plant, chemicals, clothing, or any of dozens of substances that cause allergies.<p>

Learn how numerous chronic health problems are actually caused by hidden allergies, from headaches to hay fever, depression to arthritis, sinusitis to eczema. Dr. Nambudripad tells you how to diagnose your own hidden allergies and where to find help from practitioners anywhere in the U.S. Real-life cases show how her bold allergy elimination technique changed the lives of many allergy sufferers from misery to comfort.<p>

 <b>Message Body</b>:<br>My son was born with enlarged tonsils.  The doctors tell me that they are seen in some children.  He is 5 now and is otherwise healthy.  He has only had strep once, so that is not a problem.  He did have frequent inner ear infections the first 3 years of his life. I'm looking for an alternative treatment to reduce the tonsils, naturally, and some possible causes for the enlarged tonsils.  I have a hunch that the problem is caused by either an allergy or a nutritional deficiency, but I don't know which nutrient or allergen.  Thanks

 <b>Subject:</b> Warning: Colloidal Silver, EDTA and DMPS<br>
 <b>Email:</b> <a href="mailto:mercure@primenet.com">mercure@primenet.com</a><br>
 <b>Message Body</b>:<br>1. I have to tell you of a local health food store owner here in AZ and
his decline due to colloildal silver :
    A local health food store owner is seriously sick from colloidal
silver, disabled, and his wife says he may die unless he stops taking the silver and starts chelating it with N-acetylcysteine, Lipoic acid, Glutathione, Methionine and Taurine.
    He was great before starting the colloidal silver. After starting
to take C.S. , first his skin complexion turned to bluish. Next he became pale, and now is down with serious pneumonia and indigestion , all due to the darned colloidal silver poisoning him.
    IMHO, silver is a poisonous heavy metal, just like quicksilver,
mercury, hg, mercury causes poisoning called hydrargyria, and
silver causes argyria, which is somewhat similar chronic poisoning.
Silver binds to proteins and thiols, damaged liver, bone marrow,
kidneys, pancreas, nerves etc. Only chelating agents can recover
one from colloidal or any silver caused silver poisoning, argyria.

2. EDTA chelation is potentially very dangerous for those who 
have either mercury or lead poisoning. Studies by Biochem. Ph.D 
Boyd Haley in Ky U proved that mercury and EDTA combines to
100x more toxic that either alone, producing Alzheimer-like condition. Is it worth exchanging the arterial disease to Dementia ?

Instead, there are better alternatives to remove arterial plaque.
Those are for example :

a. Nutrients to reduce homocysteine levels, and that is achieved with fairly high dose Folic acid, N-acetylcysteine, B6 vitamin, perhaps methylcobalamin and molybdenum to accelerate
homocysteine change to methionine. Mercury poisoned have to
be aware of possible risk of increased mercury methylation, if
high doses of methylcobalamin are used. B12 may not be totally
necessary, folate, NAC  and b6 should do most of the trick.

b. Products to reduce cholesterol and triglycerides in the bloodstream. Such are LIPASE enzyme ( do not take protease
in most cases, and neither amylase. Tyler Encaps and Infinity
have good products free of protease, lecithin and bile-acids
like Taurocholate and Ursodeoxycholate. Especiallu useful for
bloodstream cholesterol reduction are cholestyramine ion-exchange resins that wipe the cholesterol of the gut. Of course
low-fat/low-cholesterol diet is needed and choice of good oils,
like flax, primprose and olive oils, when any fats are needed.

c. To remove calcium from bloodstream, D-vitamin is a good
start. to encourage the transfer of calcium to bones instead out
of the bones. Fosforic acid drinks also pull calcium out, as well
as excess sugar consumption. Additionally Amalgam fillings cause
massive calcium dumping into the bloodstreat from the cells. 
Amalgams are one major origin for multitide of conditions.

3. For those who need heavy metal chelation, DMPS is NOT SAFE
for those with sulfa-intolerance or sulfa-allergy. I personally almost
died due to DMPS-IV and I had inherited sulfa-allergy, poor
sulfoxidation ( needed for DMPS metabolism ) , and low folate
status ( DMPS kills gut flora by inhibiting folate production, as it 
closely resembles sulfa-drugs DimerCaptoPropaneSulphonate )
Also, one MUST tolerance test before committing to DMPS. 
One, max oral 100 mg capsule ( Heyl GMBH, Germany ) and
1-2 weeks waiting whehter side-effects occur ( possible kidney and
pancreas damage for those who are sulfa-allergic, oral capsule
is not enough to do much damage, but IV's would be, so do not
take IV firts ). This is only for those who passed the pre-screening,
not having sulfa-allergy, poor sulfoxidation or poor folate status.

Better alternative is FDA approved oral DMSA  ( DimerCaptoSuccinate ) in low doses. DMPS is NOT FDA
approved, and it was invented in Russian in 1957 by a Sanitary
Institute Engineer. Then again, EDTA was invented by Nazi's
to allow their guards to survive the gassing of Jews and to 
survive Gas Warfare. DMPS was invented for the same reason
to help Russian solders in case there was Nerve Gas War.
DMSA was Chinese/US invention for the same reason in 60's.
DMSA is the safest and biochemically soundest of these.
DMPS is water-soluble analog of BAL, British Anti Lewisitem which
is Dimercaptopropanol, which backfired horribly ...

Best/Safest oral chelation alternatives are perhaps Glutathione,
N-acetylCysteine, Methione plus B6/Folate, perhaps Taurine,
Rutin/Quercetin and maybe Lipoic acid, but be careful with lipoate.
NAC must be taken with food, or it could think the mucus of the
stomach lining. NAC is great for mucusy lung conditions. It is
great for the liver as well as all these nutrients. Milk Thistle is also
limitedly useful, though not as good as there. Zinc, Selenium and
Molybdenum and certain organic acids accelerate the metal
chelations. One must replenish the good minerals with safe 
non-colloidal inorganic or organic minerals. Colloidals can be
very bad. Hype is not based on scientific knowledge. I guess
the dead doctors drank colloidals or something. I tried colloidals
and they were just waste of money and time.

If you suffer from mercury poisoning, search web and find excellent
homepages, like Jeff Clark's home page, I have personally
contributed to his home page, in relation to neutrophil research,
methylmercury research and especially chelation research.
http://www.teleport.com/~ctseng

I am personally yet too busy to complete my own home page, but
it is under work, and I consider writing a book about heavy metal
poisonings and chelation safety, as it seems that there is lots of
misconceptions in the field, and unsafe treatments. Chelations
and heavy metal poisonigs are much more complex issues than
most people think.

I hope this message was of some use. Please e-mail me with
questions.

Also, I am searching for true super-enzyme guru researcher, that
knows of the recombinant bacterial acid-stable enzymes, I dislike
any fungal originated products personally. Aspergillosis and
Candidiasis are no fun, why bother ...

 <b>Message Body</b>:<br>  Last April, I was diagnosed with lung cancer (adenocarcinoma), and was told I had to have most of my right lung removed to remove the malignant tumor. At the time, I didn't know any better, so I had the surgery. The cancer had also spread to 2 or the 3 lymph nodes that were biopsied. My prognosis was not good, and I was told to start radiation theraphy, which I refused.
   I had just recently heard about Essiac, and felt led to try it instead. I began taking 2 oz./ three times a day, even while I was still in the hospital. Within one month, my blood-work was much improved, and by two months, all my tests, including cat-scans, xrays,etc, were all within normal limits. My oncologist doesn't know what to think! He said he believes in some alternative medicine, but doesn't he make a lot of money by using chemo, radiation, and other life-threatning forms of treatment??
  I continue to get frequent check-ups, but I believe in my heart that I am healed! Thanks to the Lord, and Essiac tea, in that order. I will continue to take Essiac from now on, at a lower dose, it just makes me feel better!
  No, I don't sell the tea, but I would recommend it to anyone with cancer. You have nothing to lose, and everything to gain!

 <b>Message Body</b>:<br>A brief history;  In 1985 I slept in a sleeping bag that had been dry cleaned with Perchlorethylene, a chemical.  Iunderstand it has been banned in a lot of states and provinces in Canada.  The fumes affected me and I was off work for over three onths.  Over theyears my breathing problems got worse.  I am on three inhalers now - bechloforte, atrovent and ventolin.  In 1992 I had my first asthma attack.  The doctors gave me prednisone without telling me that it would leach (suck) the calcium out of my bones, which it did.  As a result I have lost over FOUR inches in height, several of mybertebra fractured.  I keep getting lung infections and of course I was prescribed a lot of different antibiotics, finally between the prednisone and the antibiotics my stomach is in bad shape.  I am now limited to what I can eat (it might be yeast infection).  I went back to my previous family doctor and when I told him about the prednisone he just shook his head.  Right now I am taking 50,000 i.u. of Vit. "D" amd a naturalsubstance called "Bone-Up" from Jarrow Formulas, Los Angeles, as well as some other medication suggested by a naturapath.
What else can it do or take to remedy some of these problems?  Does anyone know personally of the effects of Perc poisoning?  Only in Canada eh?  Thank you.....

Why would they knock their profession when this is how they make their money? We women will not be used as guinea pigs for the medical profession anymore because we were lied to.

 <b>Message Body</b>:<br>I have been fighting this cancer since 1989 and it seems to
just as reletless as I am. I want to know if any one knows of a successful treatment for this type of cancer. I remember hearing a story on NBC dateline about a boy who refused to take chemo, and someone came forward with an alternative medicine that has healed his body and made him 
free of cancer, but knowone will tell me what it was that he
took. I would appreciate any help or suggestions with this

 <b>Message Body</b>:<br>Hi All, I have been reading and trying the healing technigues in the remarkable books, A Cure for all Diseases, and A Cure for all Cancers, by Hulda Regehr Clark.
  The books are selling as fast as they can be printed and come into the stores here in Houston. Filled with case histories, and specific ways to cure anything. The author claims any cancer, even terminal ones can be cured in 5 days. See the cancer book for info. Also the author claims all diseases are curable and have the same basic biochemical cause. Her research leads her to claim that all disease is a combination of certain internal parasites mixed with tonic chemicals. And she knows what parasites combine with what tonic chemicals to cause what disease. All the info is given to heal yourself, and also duplicate the authors research, also much info for healing professionals.
   I have read hundreds and hundreds of books on alternative healing. These books are the most well documented of any I have ever read. Whatever you need help with, check them out. There is also a book on curing Aids too.
    Happy Healing

If she has found a cure then she should set up a decent clinical trial and be able to reproduce the results using an independent orgn.
Im not saying it may not work but they need to back up there claims with proof not anecdotes they are inspirational but useless as far as validity.
Its no wonder that alt medicine gets a bad name from the conv Drs when they see claims like Hulda's doing the rounds.Its a shocker, and its about time that this industry applied a bit of scientific rigour  and standards to the industry or it will never get any credibility.
Which makes it harder on us the people toget conv Drs to listen.

Read the following and be reinforced:

Sickness Can Be a Blessing, but not a Pleasant One. . .
	
	The body oftentimes gets sick in order to get better. This is the bodies way of
correcting a toxic situation---either expelling it through the lungs and nasal passages, as in
colds and congestion, or by burning it up in fevers and flu's.
	In other words, sickness can be a blessing, especially if it is a part of a detoxifying
process that accompanies an improvement in diet. For as diet improves the body, it will clean
itself up and expel toxins as part of the natural healing progression towards health.  Long term
health cannot be achieved through medication alone.  It can be attained as a part of a slow,
natural process by the body, supported by a high-fiber, low-fat diet.
	This will not always be a neat and pleasant process, and for one who is seeking long-
term healing, it should be known ahead of time that  THE ROAD TO TRUE HEALTH MAY
BE DISCOURAGING AT TIMES AS THE BODY CLEANS ITSELF UP BY GETTING
SICK TO DO SO.  This is also why, for the most part, colds an flu's should be left to run
their course and not be suppressed with drugs, if possible.  Suppressing minor sicknesses in
the short run leads to accumulations and greater body  toxicity in the long run.  Colds turn into
flu's,  flu's turn into sinus, bronchial and lung problems, then asthma, allergies, pneumonia or
cancer. 
	The prescription, as far as natural healing is concerned, would be to rest, drink lots of
water and eat as lightly as possible, preferably soups, steamed vegies, some grains and a little
protein, if the body is able to take sustenance---the reason for a light diet being to use as little
energy as possible for digestion so as to be able to use it for immune system responses.
	Another understanding of sickness may be gleaned from animals.  For if you observe
them when they get sick, they simply sit in one place or another, drink water occasionally and
wait until their sickness leaves and hunger returns.  They seem to  instinctively know that the
body is the doctor.  Of course, if the sickness is life-threatening, or too painful, then
medication may be needed or even desirable.  But until sickness is chronic and reaches that
point, natural healing would treat it by improvement in diet and life style.
	So, what is being said here is that the next time illness catches up with you, consider
your body is still working, and is able to muster the energy to expel the problem or at least
make the effort.  And, if you have really changed to a more natural diet, think of it as a house
cleaning, because when it is over you should be that much closer to being less toxic, and more
healthy.
	Indeed, if we didn't get small sicknesses periodically, we would most likely never
make it to the age of 21.  And furthermore, if medical science ever does come up with a so-
called miracle drug (like interferon) that will supposedly eliminate (suppress) the common cold
process, then the human race will be doomed to even greater sickness as there will be no
escape from the gradual building up of toxic waste inside each individual. This over-
prescribing of drugs and over-the-counter medications, in my opinion, one of the major
reasons there is probably more disease and sickness than ever before in history, as people
continually seek immediate remedies for long-term life style problems.
	Thus, if you really want to get truly healthy in the long run, start with what you are
eating. Supply your body with the nutrients to give the immune system what it needs and the
rest will take care of itself.  THE BODY IS THE DOCTOR, BUT IT CAN'T HEAL
ITSELF WITHOUT THE ELEMENTS NECESSARY TO CARRY OUT THE TASK,
namely the minerals and vitamins found in a high fibre, low fat diet.
	Try and remember that the road to healing will most likely not be a "rosy path," but a

 <b>Message Body</b>:<br>We recently bought a book titled "Prescription For Nutritional Healing" and are going to try taking vitamins to prevent warts from returning.  We've both been treated for condyloma (genital warts) from HPV.  I'm wondering if anyone else has tried to use vitamins in this manner and what results have been seen.  We're wondering if this is all just a hoax to sell vitamins, or do they really work.  I don't mind buying vitamins every month, but I want to know if it's money well spent.  Any information would be GREATLY appreciated!!!Thanks!!

 <b>Message Body</b>:<br>You seem to be skeptical on the body healing itself with proper diet and nutrition. We of course are all entitled to our own opinion, however please don't try to dissuade people that diet doesn't cure cancer or any other diseases. There are plenty of double-blind studies out there that prove this, you just need to look for them. Also just because there haven't been studies done that suit you on diet doesn't mean it doesn't work. I myself, doing what Dr. Jonas spoke about, reversed severe reumatoid arthritis. The body does heal itself, no pill in the world has ever healed anyone. The only reason there is uncontrolled cell reproduction is it has an environment that encourages growth. Try it before denigrating it.

 <b>Message Body</b>:<br>Al says try stoping a cancer from spreading with nutrition is not possible. Well Al, in late term cases you would be right most of the time. Because when it's too late, it's
really to late, the body is too sick too weak.
However, you can find numerous books on the shelves of people who have had all types of cancers reversed who took the alternative medicine route from the early stages.  
This is not fantasy but fact reported by hundreds of people
in many health biographies written to tell people that yes
it is possible to reverse almost any toxic condition in the
body through diligent nutritional practices over a long period of time.  Cancers can be shrunk.  The body can attack
cancer and encapsulate it, or even destroy it.  There are numerous incidences of this taking place all the time.
How would you explain them.  In most cases you will find the
person has made a complete life style change, and attacked his cancer or any disease from all natural healing angles.
If you call this just sitting back as compared to taking a pill, or having a surgery you have a different interpretation of sitting back. 
Wholistic and alternative approaches to healing are often long and arduous, and demand complete devotion to the task at hand for several weeks to months to years...
At the least doctors and natural healing practitioners should work together...
At the foundation of all long term healing is wholistic healing involving changes to life styles and eating patterns that will prevent and heal long term accumulations of toxins
and or body chemistries that are deficient and out of balance.  Unable to supply the immune system with what it needs to fight disease in the first place.
So what if you remove the cancer but don't remove or correct the source. In a few years its back in most cases. End of story...the bitter end.

i don't know how old you are,
but it would be a good idea to try taking kelp tablets.
a couple times a day...
kelp contains a high amount of iodine which is usually the
main cuprit behind low thyroid..
it is also high in calcium and potassium and iron
all of which are also helpful...
and i have nothing to do with Norwegian Kelp...
its just the only non salt kelp

however without proper diet...salt or no salt....it
ain't gonna matter...comprende...jose...

eat alot of green things, not worms,....and carrots are very good.

for a complete evaluation...check out my web site www.holbaleval.com

its a crap shoot without data about a person to make decisions..

but as to the kelp...it will either help you...or do nothing...
give it about a week...

and you must be eating regular meals, high fibre low fat...

thats all for now

unless i hear from you..

god bless,

since this has been going on for 10 years...
...hair analysis done correctly, and the people undertaking
it know hair serves an excretory purpose and the mineral
found are in proportion to those excreted...or excesses.
...reading hair content can tell you about excessive minerals...but overall the indications are not representitive of the the mineral balance of the body except as to what the body is kicking out...this is where interpretation usually falls apart...however even learning about excesses can lead to further learning...

yes allergies to corn, wheat,peanut butter and many other
things can cause depression...usually the thing we eat the most is the culprit...try eliminating that and see what happens....then the next thing we simply can't get by without....

...have you been tested for low blood sugar?
...low blood sugar can cause depression?
do you eat regularly?
blood sugar levels that go up and down caues mood changes.

you should get yourself on a good diet...and then see...
you may need to take medications...
but you shoud also try and takes breaks from medications,
or half the dose from time to time to see how your doing...

I have a web site a www.holbaleval.com
its an alternative medicine examination...

included is a pH test...that is little know about...
i'd like to see yours...
other then that i would eat regular meals,
exercise, have a goal to shoot for in life...if
you don't have one...and try and deal with the depression
with any medication you need...you should try to keep at a
minimun...as these drugs will have a long term effect in most cases...kidneys, brain...but you can forstall with good
diet...

chemically imbalaned depression is  tough...i know...
you just got to deal with it as best you can...
its like a heavy cross...

sounds like your dealing with it...

you might try Vitamin B complex start with 50mg 2xs/day
between meals...good for brain and stress...
actually you should just start with vitamin B1 at 50
and start from there...

and this goes for the rest of you depressives...

I believe a nurse suggested this treatment to him. Melaleuca is another name for Australian tea tree oil and can be found at your health food store. I wish I had more details but this is about it.

 <b>Message Body</b>:<br>     The article in Issue #11 on Anxiety & Depression is of great interest to me. Last week, I suffered an anxiety attack for the first time in my life. My husband suspected that I had one, and I looked up the symptoms on the internet... sure enough. I am puzzled, however, by the fact that all my symptoms were physiological. I am not suffering from depression or fears/phobias... I was not even feeling stressed when the first attack struck (I ended up having 5 over the course of the day.) 
     I am also wondering about the correlation of hormones in conjunction with a slight brain chemical imbalance, as I began my period on the day after these attacks. My worst and most recurring symptom is the feeling of being in a "different dimension," which is brief, but disturbing. I am thinking that this imbalance, coupled with a normal premenstrual hormone imbalance might have triggered my attacks.
     Since I cannot afford to fly to Colorado (where Dr. Whitcomb is) I am wonder how I might find a similar doctor here in So. Calif. I'm sure there are lots of them around here... just don't know what to look for.
     Please contact me if you know of a good doctor in my area, or you have info regarding these symptoms. Thanks so much!

Of course I have tried several measures including seeing dermatologists, using prescribed antibiotics (external and internal), changing eating habits, exercise, drinking liters of water a day, over-the-counter products, and birth control.  I am an adult now.  This is ridiculous!  I'm beginning to think the only way my skin will improve is through cosmetic surgery.  This is not the way I want to go.
	My skin is often a combination of oily, flaky, and dry.  Blemishes and whiteheads are frequent.  Fortunately blackheads are no problem.  Cosmetic products I use are designed for my skin type (Almay, Neutrogenia, Clinique, etc.)  I have given treatments and products a decent chance to work, usually several weeks.  My efforts are getting me nowhere.  Are there any suggestions as to what I can do, change, or try?  I would be grateful for any advice.

 <b>Message Body</b>:<br>I had a megacolon and had almost all of my colon removed (6 ft long, 12 inches wide) in 1985.  My small intestines have dialated and I have now been diagnosed with a nerve disorder (by Dr. Wm Snape of Long Beach CA).  I have very little peristolsis in my throat on down.  As a result I fill up with bowel and air and can get pretty sick and uncomfortable.  Nothing moves through me and I have to do an NG tube to get things started again.

I'm wondering if diet plays a part (haven't discovered anthing myself except to stay away from gassy foods), or other heaalings (tried acupuncture and currently doing hands on healing/cranial sacral).

Look forward to hearing from someone.  Thanks, Judith

I spread my meals/snacks out over 5 "meals" a day so I never get too hungry. But between lunch and 3:00 snack, I'm practically crazy looking for chocolate. I also just gave up caffeine and went through 1 week of withdrawal headaches. Any idea where these choclate cravings are coming from and how I can battle them off?

 <b>Message Body</b>:<br>I have heard the claims of many in the alt industry claiming cures and the proof is in the pudding dr jonas.My wife currently has ovarian cancer and we have tried the alt way only, at great expense, and for no direct result.It has cured her headaches,it has brought her back to her ideal weight,it has improved her cholesterol, but it hasnt stopped her cancer.
We have been on a strict diet prtiken\gerson type,iv vit c
heaps of   antioxidants,pycnogenol,meditation,wheatgass,organic juices and more for over a year.And for no result.We have not had any conventional treatment as yet.The cancer has been found very early as it was found accidently.
You should know that cancer does 4 things that make it a mongrel.1 it multiplies 2 it invades 3 it attracts blood vessels for a food source 4 it moves to different sites.This is why the conventional drs cant fix it most times.Its also why alt treatments dont work.The immune system cant identify the tumour from normal because they are our own cells .There are few foods that are proven to halt and reverse cancers.
There are many people that claim success but many can be explained.
I do believe that there are cures out there but there are an awful lot of people in this industry just there to make money from desperate people.

I also,have no doubt that the body does heal itself but I get sick of people making broad generalisations about cures and in particular cancers.We now know that many different cancers have different triggers : melanoma the sun,cervical a virus,colon diet,,breast hormonal, so come on stop with the simplistic solutions for complex problems.

If anyone knows of randomised double blind studies that have been successful please let me know.I contacted the gerson institute that have been around for decades and they could not furnish me with any proof that their treatment was superior than any others.
There are many many clinics that have been around for ages if they had the answer people would be flocking to their door as well as conv drs and chemical companies.

 <b>Message Body</b>:<br>About 5 month ago a came down with a severe hepatitis type A, recovered somewhat (still very weak, normal food intake not very well tolerated)  but still maintain a very high level of 'transaminasas' (span), 180 to 200.  A biopsy done recently shows no damage to the tissues.  The doctor took me of all vitamins, medicine, alcohol.  Something else I can do?  Suggestions are appreciated.

 <b>Message Body</b>:<br>To Al and everyone else regarding cancer:
...listen Al, it is not easy to cure cancer...i have not given you a simplistic answer...i told you indeed it is much harder to cure with natural means over time then to have surgery if possible, or radiation or whatever medically...
...the art or practice of medicine is just that...an art...individualised for each particular case...all you can do is try...
their are no guarantees...if one thing doesn't work you try another...
depends on extent and damage already done, persons health at the time and overall strength, age, enviorment, etc...
...the best you can do is try and detoxify and get on a good diet from a natural point of view...
...in places where I have visited and worked it usually takes from four to 12 weeks to turn a severe illness around...and that is with 24hr a day intensive care with complete rest, colonics, and supplementation...
...if it was me...I would slowly over a period of a week work myself into a fasting state...water only...4oz of distilled every hour for 8 hrs a day...after the third day your hunger should subside...after which i would wait untill my hunger returned, which should be between the 7 and 21 day...at which point i would begin eating again...first soups, and fruit and steamed vegies gradually working myself back into regular eating habits...
...fasting has always been a way to heal...as done properly it will help the body rebalance itself and focus on the problems at hand....
...of course this all depends on the persons age, and overall health to begin with...as some are just to weak to do this...
...another type of semi-fast is a fresh carrot juice program,  where you would drink 2-4oz of carrot juice every couple of hours for from 7-21 days...or a grape juice fast...
...Al there is no simple cure...and any healing practitioner who would say so is a fraud...
...however there are many ways to skin a cat...the right way for your wife is impossible to predict...it is all individualized..

...i tell u what Al...go to the pharmacy, get some pH tape...take a pH reading at 2pm on two seperate days of saliva and urine...making sure she has eaten at least one meal on those days prior and had nothing to eat an hour before the test...then send me the results, along with her age, blood pressure, height and weight and I'll see what i can do to help guide you...


...and stop poo pooing all over alternative healing people...of which there are many crackpots with simplistic answers, just as there are many doctors with the same kind of hit and miss remedies...

...Al, if its too late...its too late...once your that sick it is usually very difficult to turn around, but not impossible...it varies from case to case...all you can do is try...which is exactly what you have been doing...and i can feel your frustration...but don't blame the doctors...they are not the ones who are sick...they can only try to help with no guarantees...the ones that do are quacks...and there are plenty of those on both sides of the isle...ok

best wishes,
God bless,

 <b>Message Body</b>:<br>
Dont we get tetchy when challenged.Its easy for people to say it works(cancer treatments) when they are not the ones with their life in the balance.You see I have a problem with your logic. I outlined in a previous post why cancer is a mongrel.The immune system cant recognise that a tumour is bad for the host as it is the hosts cells.So it doesnt matter how stong your immune system is its not going to enter the fight because it cant see anyone to fight.
I cant find any evidence of food reversing any tumours apart from anecdotal.
Its also fine to say if one thing doesnt work try another.But your not the one swallowing 5 plus juices a day taking tablets all the time going for injections walking meditating preparing special meals buying organic produce from  special shops.There is only so much u can keep doing in a day and then after all that work u get no results.ITS EASY FOR U TO SAY JUST MOVE ONTO THE NEXT THING. 
You dont have the tumour growing inside U. And time is running out.
Thats why I have criticised alt medicine.The people affected with this lousy disease should not have to wade thru the BS spending their ever diminishing resources trying to find something to help them.
In that sense it is  ironic that people turn to alt medicine because they are unhappy with conv med yet alt med is doing exactly the same just in a different dress.

This post is not meant to imply that all alt medicine is rubbish as it is not.BUT ther are few regulations on how it is practised and it is just left to the market place to decide and the market can not do that it is driven by self interest only.
