<P>
The U.S. Treasury has announced that it will soon introduce a
new government security which will be indexed for inflation. 
The introduction of the index linked bond represents a potentially
important development both for the future structure of the public
debt as well as the yield benchmarks which will be used to measure
investment performance in the fund management industry.  Investors
have long used government securities as a proxy for risk free
returns in the financial markets.  The introduction of the index
linked bonds will now offer a proxy for measuring inflation adjusted
risk free return.
<P>
The U.S. will be the sixth OECD country to introduce index linked
government debt.  It already exists in Britain, Sweden, Canada,
Australia and New Zealand.  The British government introduced
the first index linked bonds in August 1981 and the initial security
offered a real yield of only 2.0% plus a tax free principal adjustment
for inflation.  At first, the securities were offered only to
pension funds but the rules were later modified to permit purchases
by individuals.
<P>
When the UK government introduced its first index linked bond,
many institutional investors responded positively because of their
disastrous experience with inflation during the 1970's.  In the
mid-1970's, conventional British government bonds had lost over
half of their value in nominal terms because Britain's inflation
rate had shot up to 30%.   In 1981, investors also had more modest
expectations of potential returns from securities than exist today.
 Between 1750 and 1950, the average yield on UK government securities
had been about 3.0% with an all time low of 2.21% in 1897.  The
British government's credit standing was so high that it was even
able to finance the First World War by selling bonds with a coupon
yield of 5.0%.   While commodity prices had fluctuated in a wide
range because of wars and changes in the global economy, the overall
British price level had been remarkably stable for nearly two
hundred years.  As a result, many pension funds perceived that
a government security which offered  a guaranteed real return
of 2.0% was an attractive asset.  High income individuals also
were attracted to the prospect of a bond principal inflation adjustment
which was free of income tax.  As a result of this investor support,
the UK government was able to sell over 6 billion pounds of index
linked debt during the first two years after their introduction
compared to a conventional debt stock of 150 billion pounds.
<P>
Between 1981 and 1995, the UK government's index linked securities
produced a cumulative nominal return of 154% and a cumulative
real yield of 40%.  But as the UK economy entered a period of
sustained disinflation after 1980, the return on index linked
securities significantly underperformed other asset classes, such
as equities and conventional government bonds.  Between 1981 and
1995, the UK stock market rose 5.7 times in nominal terms and
by nearly 3 times in real terms.  The price of conventional government
bonds rose by 72% while the real yield on long-term government
securities averaged 3.7%.  The real yield on Treasury bills also
averaged about 5.3% during the period 1981-1995 compared to 2.9%
on the index linked security.  <I>But while the index linked security
did not out perform conventional financial assets, it did produce
a better return than other traditional inflation hedges such as
gold and property.</I>  The British property market boomed during
the mid-1980's because of easy monetary policy but it slumped
so sharply during the early 1990's that index linked securities have out performed 
property for the period since they were introduced.  The nominal
yield on British property has averaged just under 9.0% since 1981
compared to an average nominal yield of 10% on the index linked
bonds.  The gold price peaked at $800 per ounce in 1980 and currently
sells for about $395 per ounce.
<P>
As a result of Britain's greatly improved inflation performance
under Mrs. Thatcher, the market for index linked securities never
developed  the breadth and liquidity of other asset markets. 
But the British government has been attempting to improve the market's liquidity
by doing about 15% of its recent funding in the index linked securities.
 As a result, the stock of index linked debt has expanded to 40
billion pounds compared to a net government debt stock of 260
billion pounds.
<P>
The introduction of index linked debt has produced major interest
cost savings for the British government.  The nominal yield on
index linked debt has averaged about 100-200 basis points below
the yields on other government securities.  The only cost to the
government has been the lost tax receipts from the inflation adjustment
for the depreciating real value of  bond principal.  But the savings
from reduced interest payments have been immediate while the tax
losses from indexation will be felt over the long term.  Before
the index linked bond  was introduced, the UK government had collected
tax on all interest income but it had exempted bonds from capital
gains taxation if they were held for longer than one year.
<P>
Canada, Australia, and New Zealand followed Britain's lead by
introducing index linked debt during the 1980's and early 1990's,
but their stock of index linked debt is much smaller than Britain's
both in absolute terms and as a share of their national debt.
 Canada has about $5.8 billion ($4.4 U.S.) of index linked debt,
Australia has about $6 billion ($4.8 U.S.) and New Zealand has
only about $200 million ($130 U.S.).  New Zealand has recently
increased its use of index linked debt and investor interest has
been strong because of the high yields (5.8%) and the fact that
New Zealand will soon have an election under a new system of proportional
representation which could weaken political support for non-inflationary
economic policies.  Canada issued its first index linked bonds
during 1991 when real interest rates on conventional bonds were
at high levels and then reduced the supply as interest rates fell.
 But the Canadian govenment recently began issuing new index linked
bonds and plans to have quarterly auctions at a rate of $300-500
million.  Sweden introduced index linked bonds only last year
but it is promoting them so aggressively that they could be worth
about 10% of Sweden's $100 billion of public debt by early 1997.
 The bonds have so far suffered from illiquidity because pension
funds have been hoarding them, but the coming expansion of supply
should enhance trading.  They offer a real yield of over 5.5%
as well as an inflation adjustment but, in contrast to Britain
and other commonwealth countries, there is no tax exemption for
the inflation indexation component of the return.
<P>
The U.S. Treasury will soon hold hearings around the country to
obtain investor reactions to its proposals for an inflation adjusted
bond.  At present,  the only details which the Treasury has provided
about the new instrument is that it will be available in maturities
of ten or thirty years and that it will be in denominations of
$1,000 per bond.  It has not yet decided which price index to
use for adjusting the bonds for inflation but is considering a
variety of alternatives, including the Consumer Price Index, the
GDP deflator, the CPI excluding food and energy and the Employment
Cost Index.

The recent growth of the American mutual fund industry has been so dramatic that it is giving the U.S. a very different financial structure than other industrial countries.  In the modern era, countries have typically organized their financial system around either a universal banking model encompassing many financial services or a hybrid structure which separates commercial and investment banking.  The U.S. is in the midst of creating a whole new financial system, in which the mutual fund sector is increasingly displacing commercial banks as the major repositories of household wealth as well as suppliers of capital to many small and medium sized companies.

<P>

The U.S. mutual fund industry began during the 1920's and grew steadily during the decades after World War Two but its total assets remained very modest compared to the banking system until recently.  In 1960, equity funds had assets of $11.9 billion and bond funds had assets of $5.1 billion but there were not yet any money market funds.  The bull market of the 1960's increased the industry's equity assets to $38.5 billion while bond funds grew to $9.1 billion.  There was little growth of equity assets during the 1970's because of the severe bear market which resulted from high inflation during the middle years of the decade but the introduction of money market funds produced $76.4 billion of new assets for the industry during the period 1975-1980.  Money market funds exploded after 1978 because the Federal Reserve sharply increased money market yields to combat inflation while banks were not permitted to offer market interest rates on their deposits until the early 1980's.  As a result, money funds accounted for almost 75% of the mutual fund industry's total assets by 1982.

<P>

The U.S. mutual fund industry now has $1.3 trillion of equity oriented funds, $811 billion of long-term bond funds, and $753 billion of money market funds.  Its collective assets of nearly $3 trillion now greatly exceed the $2.3 trillion of assets in the national banking system but are still smaller than the $4.2 trillion of assets in all of America's 10,000 insured commercial banks.     The ownership of mutual funds is not as universal as the ownership of bank accounts.  About 30.2% of U.S. households own a mutual fund whereas over  87% of households have a bank account.  But the population of mutual fund owners is expanding rapidly.  It included 24% of households in 1990, 12% in 1984 and only 6% in 1980.  Mutual fund owners also tend to be more affluent than other groups.  In 1994, 57% of households with incomes above $75,000 had mutual funds compared to 40% for the $35,000-50,000 income group and 13% for people with incomes below $25,000 per annum. The mutual fund industry will benefit as well from the fact that younger people are more accustomed to using mutual funds as outlets for their savings than older people.  At present, 27% of households in the age group 35-45 own mutual funds compared to 33% for people in the age group 44-64 and 21% for people aged 65 and over.

<P>

The ratio of mutual fund assets to GDP in the U.S. is now at 38% or the highest among the major industrial nations.  The country with the second highest ratio of mutual fund assets to GDP is France at 35% but over seventy five percent of French assets are in money market funds and bond funds whereas in the U.S. equities account for 45% of the industry's assets.  Germany has the lowest ratio of mutual fund assets to GDP among the major industrial nations.  It is only 5.2% and just 25% of mutual fund assets are invested in equities.  Other major English speaking nations have ratios of mutual funds assets to GDP in the 14-15% range.  In Britain, the ratio is 14.4% and practically all of the assets are in equities because the  tax system discourages retail demand for bond funds.  In Canada, mutual fund assets are equal to 14.5% of GDP and half of the assets are in equities.  The Japanese stock market is so dominated by corporate cross shareholdings that retail investors own only about one fourth of corporate equity.  As a result, the ratio of mutual fund assets to GDP is only 9.5% and fixed income funds account for about 67% of industry assets.

<P>

Ironically, the factor which produced such a dramatic expansion of the mutual fund industry during the 1990's was a monetary policy designed to rescue American banks from a sharp rise in non-performing real estate loans. After 1991, the Federal Reserve reduced nominal short-term interest rates to 3.0% or the lowest level in three decades in order to boost the profits of the U.S. banking system.  The positive shape of the yield curve permitted U.S. banks to significantly bolster their lending margins, earn healthy profits from their large portfolios of long term government bonds (U.S. banks had more government bonds than commercial loans in 1993) and boost their equity/asset ratios to the highest level since the 1960's.  But low money market yields and a positively sloped yield curve have also encouraged households to shift savings flows from bank deposits into higher yielding instruments, such as bond and equity mutual funds.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results -- but history can provide yet another way to consider the presidential prospects. In the table below, we've used Towers Data Systems data to review how the stock market performed in each presidential term since 1929. The <A HREF="http://www.stockinfo.standardpoor.com/idxinfo.htm">Standard & Poor's 500</A>, an unmanaged index of common stocks that's generally considered representative of the U.S. stock market, served as our proxy for stock market performance.

When assessing the return of your mutual fund investment, you must

consider it in context of the markets in which the fund strives to

perform.

<P>



The most widely quoted measure of the performance of the financial

markets is the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Unfortunately, "the Dow"

may provide very little insight on how your mutual fund investment is

progressing. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is a group of 30 blue chip

industrial stocks. 

<P>



More useful to you will be the performance of the particular index -- an

unmanaged group of similar investments -- that your mutual fund uses as

a benchmark for its investment objective. 

<P>



Comparing your fund against its index can be enlightening. Note, though,

that a fund's return will depend upon its specific investments. To

understand why your fund outperformed or underperformed its index, it

may also be helpful to compare the composition of your fund's portfolio

with the composition of the index over the same period of time.

Significant performance differences may arise if your fund and the index

were invested in different companies and industries throughout the

period. Other factors, such as cash flows in and out of a fund and fees

and expenses, may affect the relationship between fund performance and

the index.

<IMG SRC="gifs/prepared_vola_head.gif" ALT="Are You Prepared For More Volatility?">
<BR>
If investing in the stock market involved one single, uninterrupted
climb in prices, there would be no risk involved. But stock prices
cannot be counted on to rise and certainly not in an orderly way. They
surge and they fall. 
<P>

The range that the stock market covers in a given year - the difference
between its high and low for the year - is a measure of a year's
volatility. Over the 1978 to 1994 period, "average" volatility of the
<A HREF="http://www.stockinfo.standardpoor.com/brochure/idxdirs.htm">Standard & Poor's 500</A> was about 25 percent, according to an analysis by
Kemper's Quantitative Research Department. (The S&P 500 is an unmanaged
index that's generally considered representative of the domestic stock
market.)  Yet since 1992, markets have been much 
less volatile. For example, volatility in the stock market, as represented by
the <A HREF="http://www.dowjones.com">Dow Jones Industrial Average</A>, was at a 95-year low in 1995, according to <I>Barron's.</I>
<P>

What's the significance of this? Kemper Portfolio Strategist Tom Regner
worries that such low levels of volatility have given investors -
especially new investors - unrealistic expectations about the degrees to
which their equity investments can fluctuate. Because the market has
historically been more volatile than its most recent performance, you
may want to give some thought to its potential for renewed volatility
and the impact volatility could have on your investments.
<P>

The following are a few suggestions on how you might prepare for
heightened stock market volatility:
<P>

<UL>
<LI> You could diversify. When you're concerned about your exposure in one
market, exposure to another market can help reduce the impact of
volatility. Instead of subjecting 100 percent of your portfolio to
what's going on in one market, a portion of your portfolio will move
with influences of a separate market.
<P>

Two other broad markets to invest in are the fixed-income markets and
international markets. Obviously, both represent their own risks and
potential rewards - and these markets can be volatile at times, as well.
For instance, the international markets present risks associated with
currency exchange rate fluctuations. However, you can help reduce the
riskiness of your investment strategy when you reduce your dependency on
a single market.
<P>

<LI> You could try to avoid volatility by moving some or a portion of your
investment in the stock market into a cash-type investment that seeks to
maintain the stability of the principal. A money market fund, for
example, is designed for investors who want to avoid the fluctuations
that are typical of the stock and bond markets. Although there can be no
assurance that it will, a money market fund seeks to maintain a stable
net asset value of $1.00 per share. Money market funds are neither
insured nor guaranteed by the U.S. government. 
<P>

Moving into such an investment can help limit your exposure to the
downside of volatility. The trade-off, however, is that you also will be
removed from benefiting when and if the market's volatility turns in the
investor's favor.
<P>

<LI> You could welcome volatility. Volatility has the potential to reward
the regular investor. Investors who prearrange to invest a fixed amount
into a mutual fund every month - regardless of the fund's share price -
can benefit from dips. How? When prices are low, your fixed investment
will buy more shares than could be bought when prices are high. Here's
the catch, however: The assumption is that the share price will bounce
back up and that you will still be invested if it does.
<P>

A program of regular investment cannot assure a profit or protect
against a loss in a declining market. Since this strategy (called dollar
cost averaging) involves continuing contributions regardless of
fluctuating share values, you'll need to consider your financial ability
to continue the program through periods of low price levels. For more

<IMG SRC = "gifs/forecast_head.gif" ALT = "A Weather Forcast for International Markets">
<BR>
At a time when many investors are looking overseas for their investment returns, some markets offer more promising weather than others. Dennis Ferro, director of international equities for Zurich Investment Management Limited, provides the following forecast for three markets likely to enjoy favorable conditions and three markets that you might want to avoid. (And, at all times, you'll want to follow this advisory: investment in international securities presents special risk considerations including exchange rates, government regulations and differences in liquidity. Be sure to talk to your financial representative for what's appropriate for your circumstances.)<P>


<IMG SRC = "gifs/forecast1_subhead.gif" ALT = "Ireland">
<BR>
One of the smallest foreign markets, Ireland in 1996 has several appeals. Moderate inflation should provide a conducive environment for its good quality, reasonably financed companies to become increasingly competitive on a global scale. Specifically, investors are attracted to its financial services, food processing and specialized manufacturing industries. Ireland's labor force is one of its significant competitive advantages: Workers are well educated and have a good work ethic. While there has been a correlation between the performance of the Irish market and the United Kingdom, Ireland's flexible work force and financial incentives have made it an attractive alternative. <P>

<IMG SRC = "gifs/forecast2_subhead.gif" ALT = "The Netherlands">
<BR> 
The Netherlands is an example of a foreign market whose positive fiscal policy has supported corporate progress. Both inflation and unemployment have been relatively low, and several solid companies have succeeded in building strong international businesses. Dutch companies are especially dominant in commercial publishing, electronics and growing software development and computer applications for European corporate needs. <P>

<IMG SRC = "gifs/forecast3_subhead.gif" ALT = "Japan">
<BR>
Having suffered a recession for the last five years, Japan should be the comeback story of 1996. The government is addressing its myriad problems (including banking, deregulation and trade), and many corporations have initiated steps to heighten their competitiveness. Increased corporate confidence in the system should result in a resumption of industrial production and capital expenditures - the very events needed for the economy's recovery. The health of Japan, the largest foreign market with a broad base of industries and strong infrastructure, has a direct effect on southeast Asia. Its improvement, then, could help the economies of Malaysia and Singapore.<P>

<IMG SRC = "gifs/forecast4_subhead.gif" ALT = "Germany">
<BR>
Concerns about inflation have kept German monetary policy tight for years. Consequently, interest rates have not fallen at the same pace that economic activity has. <P>

Opportunities in Germany's stock market tend to be large cyclical companies and financial institutions. German companies' ability to compete and expand profit margins is inhibited by relatively high compensation levels. This, combined with a strong deutsche mark, make it difficult for Germany's export industries to compete against products produced by countries with lower average wages.<P>

<IMG SRC = "gifs/forecast5_subhead.gif" ALT = "Russia">
<BR>
Just a few years ago, Russia represented untold potential. Many practicalities - including the government's taxation and regulation - have frustrated foreign investors, and growth has yet to occur as was predicted. IBM's recent cancellation of a manufacturing facility is just one sign that Russia is a market best avoided by the faint of heart.<P>

<IMG SRC = "gifs/forecast6_subhead.gif" ALT = "Brazil">
<BR>
Dramatic rallies draw investors to Latin American markets - but their volatility can also discourage investment. Brazil is an example of a market that has been strong recently, buoyed by an expanding economy heavily dependent on foreign financial support from the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. While the country has a developing manufacturing base and a strong resource sector, it is sensitive to export demand and global commodity prices. The health of Brazil's banking system remains suspect, and difficult political decisions must be made if continued progress is to occur. <P>

<IMG SRC="gifs/totalreturn_head.gif" ALT="How To Arrive At Total Return"><BR>

A recent <I>Kemper Reports</I>&#160; survey found that most shareholders responding to a recent Kemper Pulse survey evaluate the performance of their mutual fund on the basis of total return (for more survey results, see <A HREF="evaluate_perform.html">How Kemper Shareholders Evaluate Performance</A>). That's good because total return represents the net effect of everything that happened with your fund over a certain time period (see below for a complete description of total return). 
<P>

To fully understand your fund's performance, it can be helpful to review the components of total return. A fund's total return in one year cannot be used to predict its performance in the next. By considering where your fund's return came from, however, you may have a better idea of what will influence your fund's ability to perform in the future.
<P>

Let's review the components of total return for three basic fund types.
<P>


<IMG SRC="gifs/totalreturn_subhead1.gif" ALT="Money market funds"><BR>

A money market fund's total return will be generated by income earned on its net investments, which is paid to shareholders in the form of income dividends. Short-term capital gains and unrealized appreciation, while possible, are uncommon.
<P>

<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="gifs/totalreturn_image1.gif" ALT="Money market funds total return">
</CENTER><P>

Because a money market fund must continually reinvest as its existing short-term securities mature - requiring the proceeds to be reinvested at prevailing rates - the money market fund is especially sensitive to changes in rates. Its earning ability is directly dependent upon short-term interest rates, and its income distributions will fluctuate.
<P>

At the same time, however, the fund manager strives to avoid NAV fluctuation. A money market fund seeks to maintain a stable net asset value $1.00 per share (although there can be no assurance that it will).
<P>


<IMG SRC="gifs/totalreturn_subhead2.gif" ALT="Income funds"><BR>

There are many types of income funds, and each type has its own investment strategy. But every income fund shares one objective: the generation of current income.
<P>

<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="gifs/totalreturn_image2.gif" ALT="Income funds total return">
</CENTER>
<P>

These are just a few of the considerations that can affect a fund's ability to earn income:<BR>

<UL>
<LI>The type of income-producing security that the fund invests in - e.g., because of the greater risk to principal, corporate bonds and mortgages (and mortgage-related securities) will generally yield more than comparable maturity U.S. Treasuries.
<LI>The length of the fund's investment - funds that are willing to take the risk of investing in securities for a longer period of time will generally be compensated (with a higher rate of return) for assuming such risk.
<LI>The quality of the investment - in order to appeal to investors, a poorer quality investment generally needs to offer a higher rate of return.
</UL>
<P>

Each of these considerations represents a risk - and that risk can be reflected in fluctuations in the price of a fund's shares.
<P>

Lower-risk income funds - specifically funds whose objective is to maintain preservation of principal - will attempt to provide relative NAV stability. As with other income funds, these funds' ability to generate income depends upon interest rates and the maturities of their securities. However, the range of NAV change - up or down - may not be as great as other funds.
<P>

High-risk income are willing to take maximum risk to maximize current income. Such a strategy, however, can erode principal. In that case, a positive total return may be the result of strong income dividends offsetting a shrinking net asset value.
<P>



<IMG SRC="gifs/totalreturn_subhead3.gif" ALT="Capital growth funds"><BR>

Capital growth funds, whose potential for total return is the highest among all mutual fund types over time, generally produce their total return from a combination of capital gain, income and price appreciation. Both the dividends and net asset value of your capital growth fund will fluctuate.
<P>

<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="gifs/totalreturn_image3.gif" ALT="Capital growth funds total return">
</CENTER>
<P>

The level of dividend income earned from stocks owned by the portfolio will fluctuate. Income dividends vary according to many factors, including the number of dividend-paying stocks in a portfolio and the level of dividends paid.
<P>

No year is the same as the next when it comes to capital gain dividends. The strength of the stock market in 1995, for example, prompted several fund managers to take profits on many holdings, which generated significant capital gains.
<P>

It is possible for a fund to produce a solid total return without paying significant dividends. In order to do this, the value of the portfolio must appreciate.
<P>

Within the broad category of capital growth funds are funds that combine capital growth and income. Capital growth and income funds offer the added potential of earning income from fixed-income securities owned by the portfolio. By investing in bonds or other securities that produce income, this fund type helps reduce its reliance on capital growth - and its risk level. Of course, this strategy of attempting to reduce risk is not without a cost: The prospect of building total return through price appreciation is diminished for this type of fund.

Let's face it, if there were a place where we could all earn a solid return on our investments with little or no risk, you probably wouldn't be reading this. But, very often, you may have to accept more risk to seek higher potential returns than those offered by guaranteed or insured investments.

<IMG BORDER=0 SRC="gifs/diversification_subhd3.gif" ALT="Diversification At Work!"><BR>
Scott Jordan is 50 years old. Through hard work and determination, Scott has managed to save $100,000 over the years. Scott wants to retire at age 60, but feels that he needs to earn more on his investments than he is presently earning in order to retire in comfort.
<P>
His financial advisor has suggested that he put his money in several investments, each with varying degrees of risk, in order to make his retirement nest egg potentially grow faster.
<P>
Scott asks just one question:<BR>
<B>"What if I lose money?"</B>


<P>

To help reassure Scott, his financial advisor illustrates this scenario: a hypothetical total loss of one investment.


<P>
Let's see what happened to Scott's hypothetical investment in this example.
<P>

<IMG BORDER=0 SRC="gifs/diversification_chart.gif">

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#996633"><B>Result: Scott's hypothetical portfolio MORE THAN DOUBLED its original value, from 1-1-86 through 12-31-95.</B></FONT>


<P>
<B>Even with a 100% loss</B> from one of Scott's investment choices, his historical hypothetical investment in the U.S. stock market (represented by the <A HREF="http://www.stockinfo.standardpoor.com/brochure/idxdirs.htm">S&amp;P stock index</A>), the international stock market (represented by the <A HREF="http://www.ms.com/mscidata/data/">EAFE international stock index</A>), the bond market (represented by a bond index) and <A HREF="http://www.ustreas.gov/treasury/bureaus/pubdebt/noteauc.html">Treasury bills</A> grew enough over 10 years to offset his loss from 1-1-86 through 12-31-95.


<P><BR>





<IMG BORDER=0 SRC="gifs/diversification_subhd4.gif" ALT="No One Can Predict Which Investment Will Perform Best Or Worst"><BR>
By spreading your investment over several choices, you may be able to participate in the return potential of the stock market and reduce your risk.

<IMG BORDER=0 SRC="gifs/diversification_coins.gif" ALIGN=LEFT>
<BR>
In our example, Scott's historical hypothetical investments included investments in stocks and bonds, represented by indices. Another popular way to diversify is to invest in a mutual fund, which spreads its portfolio holdings across a number of stocks and/or bonds.
<P>
Not only does this further spread the risk of investing in the stock or bond markets, it allows your money to be managed by professional portfolio managers, trained to recognize both opportunities and risks.

Professional management can add a great deal of value to the concept of diversification. Mutual fund shareholders benefit from the years of experience each portfolio management team brings to the table.
<P>
Ask your financial representative to review your investments in light of your financial goals and your tolerance for risk.

<IMG BORDER=0 SRC="gifs/mistakes_head.gif" ALT="The 13 Most Common Mistakes To Avoid When Investing In Mutual Funds">
<P>

<IMG BORDER=0 SRC="gifs/mistakes_growthchart.gif" ALT="Amazing Growth in the Number of Mutual Funds: 1985-1995" ALIGN=RIGHT>
How fast is the mutual fund industry growing? Today, 31% of all American households own shares of at least one mutual fund. Between 1990 and year-end 1995, assets in mutual funds skyrocketed from $567 billion to $2.1 trillion. And, as the chart at right indicates, the number of mutual funds available has also soared, from 1,500 in 1985 to more than 5,700 today. Clearly, American investors are aware of the advantages of mutual funds. Now, we'd like to take that awareness one step further.
<P>
The following are 13 of the most common and costly mistakes to avoid when investing in mutual funds. After all, one of the surest routes to <I>smart</I>&#160; investing is <I>educated</I>&#160; investing.
<BR CLEAR=RIGHT>

<P>


<B><FONT SIZE=+1 COLOR="003300">Common Mistake #1</FONT></B><BR>
<FONT COLOR="#660000"><B>Choosing a fund with short-term objectives to address long-term financial goals.</B></FONT>
<P>
If you are investing for your preschooler's college education or a dream retirement home, then a long-term investment perspective is probably more appropriate than a short-term one. Generally speaking, the more long-term your perspective, the greater your tolerance of price fluctuations should be. After all, if you are giving an investment 20 or 25 years to grow, you can probably withstand the price fluctuations that have historically accompanied greater rewards.
<P>
In short, don't overlook the dual use of many mutual fund investments -- meeting monthly income needs while also taking advantage of long-term growth potential.

<P>

<B><FONT SIZE=+1 COLOR="003300">Common Mistake #2</FONT></B><BR>
<FONT COLOR="#660000"><B>Always choosing the fund that is advertising the highest yield, rather than looking at total return.</B></FONT>
<P>
Yield is one way of evaluating a fund's performance. A high yield, however, may come at the expense of the fund's net asset value, or share price. Some funds may reduce the underlying value to pay out that high current income. As a result, the market value of your investment may be diminished.
<P>
The most complete measure of mutual fund performance is <I><A HREF="../totalreturn.html">total return</A></I>.&#160; Total return takes into account the three components of performance: income dividends, capital gain dividends and changes in the value of your fund's shares. As a result, total return provides a more complete picture of performance than looking only at current income, or yield.

<P>

<B><FONT SIZE=+1 COLOR="003300">Common Mistake #3</FONT></B><BR>
<FONT COLOR="#660000"><B>Choosing a fund based on incomplete magazine or newspaper information.</B></FONT>
<P>
Some magazine and newspaper rankings are based on yield (current income) rather than on the total value of the investment. Also, look carefully at the reporting period for a fund's performance. Some funds have had high returns for a quarter or two, or maybe one year. If you are making a long-term investment, it's critical that you look at the performance of a fund over a longer period of time -- three, five, or even ten years. Of course, a fund's past performance cannot guarantee its future performance, but it can give you a good idea of a fund's history and whether it has performed consistently over the years.
<P>
Two of the best-known third-party ranking services are <A HREF="http://www.lipperweb.com/">Lipper Analytical Services, Inc.</A> and <A HREF="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/library/msmf.pl">Morningstar, Inc.</A> Both rank funds by total return over long periods of time.

<P>

<B><FONT SIZE=+1 COLOR="003300">Common Mistake #4</FONT></B><BR>
<FONT COLOR="#660000"><B>Investing in mutual funds that deduct sales charges from your reinvested dividends.</B></FONT>
<P>
<IMG BORDER=0 SRC="gifs/mistakes_chart4.gif" ALT="Missing Out on Additional Income Earned from Free Reinvestment of Dividends" ALIGN=RIGHT>
A sales charge compensates the individual who helps you select the right mutual fund. But, after you buy, why should you continue paying? Make sure the fund you select doesn't continue to deduct sales charges on your reinvested dividends. Over the life of your investment, free dividend reinvestment, with full compounding, can be a significant benefit. Kemper Funds offer free reinvestment of dividends at net asset value. That means you do not pay a sales charge for dividend reinvestment.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>
Note: The assumed 8% return in the chart is not indicative of past or future performance of any particular mutual fund. The yield and net asset value of a mutual fund will fluctuate. In the example, total income earned from free reinvestment of dividends compounded monthly over a 10-year period is $22,196.40. Total income earned from reinvestment of dividends with a 4% sales charge over a 10-year period is $21,501.83. So, the additional income earned from free reinvestment of dividends over a 10-year period is $694.57.
</FONT>
<BR CLEAR=RIGHT>

<P>

<B><FONT SIZE=+1 COLOR="003300">Common Mistake #5</FONT></B><BR>
<FONT COLOR="#660000"><B>Not investing in a municipal bond mutual fund when your objective is tax-free income.</B></FONT>
<P>
Given today's potentially higher marginal tax rates, more investors are turning to tax-free investments such as mutual funds that invest in municipal bonds. The income dividends from these funds are exempt from federal income taxes, though they may be subject to state or local taxes. And, if you invest in a state-specific fund, the income can be free from state and local taxes as well. For some investors, a portion of income may be subject to the alternative minimum tax.<SUP><A HREF="#1">1</A></SUP>

<P>

<B><FONT SIZE=+1 COLOR="003300">Common Mistake #6</FONT></B><BR>
<FONT COLOR="#660000"><B>Not having an Individual Retirement Account (IRA) if you are eligible to have one.</B></FONT>
<P>
Despite legislative changes over the years, the IRA continues to offer most investors tremendous opportunities to save and invest for retirement through the deferral of taxes. The powerful effect of tax-deferred compounding over time, and the affordability of the IRA, continue to make this an extremely important component of effective retirement planning.
<P>
Investing in more than one mutual fund IRA allows you to further reduce risk by diversifying. You should, of course, review the description of the investment objective and policies in the <A HREF="../../prospectus.html">prospectus</A> of a fund before investing to more fully understand the market and credit risk associated with an investment in a particular fund.<SUP><A HREF="#1">1</A></SUP>

<P>

<B><FONT SIZE=+1 COLOR="003300">Common Mistake #7</FONT></B><BR>
<FONT COLOR="#660000"><B>Choosing a fund without understanding all of the fees and expenses.</B></FONT>
<P>
Some investors shop by comparing only sales charges. But, in addition to sales charges, mutual fund shareowners indirectly pay for management fees, general expenses, and, in some cases, distribution and administrative fees.
<P>
Distribution and administrative fees are used by some funds toward payment of fund marketing and account-servicing. These fees are normally paid to third parties, like brokerage firms and banks, which market and service fund accounts. These charges are either in lieu of, or in addition to, sales charges paid by the investor. Management fees are paid by the fund to the fund's investment manager for expertise in the management of the fund's portfolio. These fees are usually a fixed percent per annum of the funds average net assets.
<P>
General expenses include other operational expenses that are charged directly to the fund and include transfer agent, custodial and legal fees. Before you invest, study all the fees. It's better to know up-front than to find out later that performance of your fund is being pulled down by high distribution and management fees, or uncontrolled fund expenses. And, be sure to read a fund's <A HREF="../../prospectus.html">prospectus</A> before you invest.

<P>

<B><FONT SIZE=+1 COLOR="003300">Common Mistake #8</FONT></B><BR>
<FONT COLOR="#660000"><B>Choosing a fund that doesn't have the shareholder privileges you might need or failing to activate those privileges when you open a fund account.</B></FONT>
<P>
To make the management of your account easier, most mutual funds offer investing privileges free of charge. Some funds, however, charge a fee for using them.
<P>
To avoid headaches and delays later on, be sure to activate your investing privileges -- especially exchange and wire-redemption privileges -- when you open a new account. These privileges include: <A HREF="../../shareholders/forms.html">reinvestment of dividends</A>, <A HREF="../../shareholders/forms.html">exchange privileges</A>, <A HREF="../../shareholders/forms.html">wire redemptions</A>, <A HREF="../../shareholders/forms.html">pre-authorized purchase plans</A> and <A HREF="../../shareholders/forms.html">systematic withdrawal plans</A>.
<P>
Whatever you decide, make sure that you choose a fund that offers the privileges you need - at no extra charge. These privileges are subject to modification, suspension, or termination by a fund. 

<P>

<B><FONT SIZE=+1 COLOR="003300">Common Mistake #9</FONT></B><BR>
<FONT COLOR="#660000"><B>Failing to reinvest all dividends in order to take advantage of the power of compounding.</B></FONT>
<P>
<IMG BORDER=0 SRC="gifs/mistakes_chart9.gif" ALT="Failing to Reinvest Dividends and Missing Out on the Power of Compounding" ALIGN=RIGHT>
Reinvesting your dividends can help add substantially to the growth of your investment. The chart to the right (for illustrative purposes only) portrays the beneficial impact of reinvestment income monthly at various interest rates, over a ten-year period. The chart assumes a $10,000 initial investment. The assumed rates are not representative of any yield or return that a particular fund may offer.
<BR CLEAR=RIGHT>

<P>

<B><FONT SIZE=+1 COLOR="003300">Common Mistake #10</FONT></B><BR>
<FONT COLOR="#660000"><B>Failing to get professional advice in selecting the mutual funds that are right for your unique financial situation.</B></FONT>
<P>
Today's marketplace offers more than 5,700 mutual funds with many different investment objectives. In each investment category alone, there can be hundreds of funds from which to choose. How do you decide which fund is best for your personal financial situation and goals?
<P>
The answer is simple: obtain the advice of a broker, banker or financial planner before you purchase. In today's ever-changing financial and tax environment, the need for professional guidance has never been greater. It's easy to consult a broker, banker or financial planner before you make a mutual fund choice.

<P>

<B><FONT SIZE=+1 COLOR="003300">Common Mistake #11</FONT></B><BR>
<FONT COLOR="#660000"><B>Choosing a fund that makes redeeming shares like pulling teeth.</B></FONT>
<P>
Make sure the fund you select has simple and convenient redemption procedures. At most fund companies, the quickest and most convenient way is to have redemption proceeds wired to your local bank account. Kemper's wire-redemption privilege, if pre-authorized, makes it possible for you to redeem $1,000 or more with one toll-free phone call. Your money is normally sent via FedWire&#174; to your designated bank account the next business day, free of charge by the fund.
<P>
Even if you did not choose wire-redemption privileges, you may still redeem up to $50,000* without obtaining a signature guarantee. To redeem $50,000 or less, just call your financial representative. Or, you can send a letter requesting the amount you desire, signed by the owner(s) of the account. A check payable to you will be sent to your address of record within seven days. There is no need to make an extra trip to your bank or broker to get your signature guaranteed.
<P>
*Redemption requests by individuals and certain designated institutional account holders for over $50,000, and all requests by institutions not so designated, do require a signature guarantee. See the <A HREF="../../prospectus.html">prospectus</A> for details and limitations.

<P>

<B><FONT SIZE=+1 COLOR="003300">Common Mistake #12</FONT></B><BR>
<FONT COLOR="#660000"><B>Choosing a fund that is not a member of a family of mutual funds.</B></FONT>
<P>
Financial markets are constantly changing in response to economic and environmental factors. As a result, the mutual fund you select today may not be right tomorrow. You need the advantage of being able to conveniently exchange into another fund with different investment objectives. So you should select a fund that is part of a family of funds.
<P>
Kemper Funds include a wide range of mutual funds to address a lifetime of changing investment objectives. Should your investment needs or market conditions change, you can move your investment within the Fund Family with one toll-free call.* Your Shareholder Services representative will be happy to tell you more about the other Kemper Funds.
<P>
*The exchange privilege is subject to modification, suspension and termination and to certain limitations described in the <A HREF="../../prospectus.html">prospectus</A>.

<P>

<B><FONT SIZE=+1 COLOR="003300">Common Mistake #13</FONT></B><BR>

<IMG BORDER=0 SRC="gifs/dollarcost_head.gif" ALT="Dollar Cost Averaging">

<P>



<IMG BORDER=0 SRC="gifs/dollarcost_subhd1.gif" ALT="Now you don't have to try to predict when and how the markets will move."><BR>
<B>"Buy low, sell high."</B> So easy to say, but not so easy to do.  In reality, many investors find it tough to resist the natural temptation to pull out of the market when prices are falling, or to put more money in after a significant rally.
<P>
And many more investors, concerned that they have to get it <I>right</I>&#160; to hit it <I>big</I>, spend so long waiting for the "right time" to get into the market that they never do invest.  They let their fears about market fluctuations deny them the outstanding performance opportunities provided by stocks.


<P><BR>

<IMG BORDER=0 SRC="gifs/dollarcost_subhd2.gif" ALT="A strategy to make market fluctuation  work for you."><BR>
There is a way to help reduce the risk of investing at the wrong time and actually take advantage of the ups and downs of the stock market.  It's a simple strategy that proves timing isn't everything.  It's called <B>dollar cost averaging</B>.
<P>
While <B>dollar cost averaging</B> can help protect you from buying only at the absolute worst time, it cannot guarantee a profit or protect against a loss in a declining market.  But if you have the patience to ride out the tough times and stick to your regular investing schedule, there are definite advantages to dollar cost averaging.


<P><BR>


<IMG BORDER=0 SRC="gifs/dollarcost_subhd3.gif" ALT="Invest regular amounts at regular intervals - and stick to your plan."><BR>
With <B>dollar cost averaging</B>, you make smaller investments at regular intervals over a period of time, instead of a large, one-time investment.  The investment amount and frequency are up to you (for instance, $200 each week, $500 each month, or $1,000 every three months).
<P>
Successful <B>dollar cost averaging</B> requires that you stick to your plan, regardless of what the market does.  Make sure you select an amount that is consistent with your financial means, so that you can continue to purchase shares even through periods of low share prices.


<P><BR>


<IMG BORDER=0 SRC="gifs/dollarcost_subhd4.gif" ALT="How does dollar cost averaging work?"><BR>
It's simpler than you might expect.

<P>

<IMG BORDER=0 SRC="gifs/dollarcost_subhd5.gif" ALT="Pay a lower cost per share."><BR>
Since you invest the same dollar amount each period, you automatically purchase more shares when prices are low and fewer shares when prices are high.  This means that, over the entire purchase period, your average cost per share will be lower than the investment's average price per share.  And you have used market fluctuations to your investment advantage.


<P>


<IMG BORDER=0 SRC="gifs/dollarcost_subhd6.gif" ALT="Let's look at some hypothetical examples:"><BR>
You've decided to invest $5,000 in a stock mutual fund, in $1,000 monthly investments over a five-month period.  Let's see how three typical market trends-rising, declining, and fluctuating (up and down)-affect your total investment.
<P>
Note:  The hypothetical share prices used are for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to represent the actual prices of any Kemper Fund.


<P><BR>


<IMG BORDER=0 SRC="gifs/dollarcost_subhd7.gif" ALT="During a Rising Market"><BR>
In an up market, the best possible time to buy is obviously at the very beginning-the ground floor. But how can you tell exactly when the upswing will start? The truth is, no one can.
<P>
<CENTER>
<IMG BORDER=0 SRC="gifs/dollarcost_rising.gif">
</CENTER>
<P>
The beauty of <B>dollar cost averaging</B> is that you don't need a crystal ball to guide your investment plan.
<P>
When the share price drops, you should resist profit-taking -- selling your shares -- and continue your regular $1,000 investments.

<P>
<CENTER>
<IMG BORDER=0 SRC="gifs/dollarcost_declining.gif">
</CENTER>
<P>
While <B>dollar cost averaging</B> cannot protect against a loss in a declining market, you purchase more shares at lower prices with each investment.

If you had committed your entire $5,000 the first month, you'd have received only 1,000 shares worth just $1,000 after 5 months. The price would have to rebound all the way to $5 just to break even...

<IMG SRC="gifs/taxable_head.gif" ALT="Taxable Or Tax-Exempt?">
<BR>

Depending on your tax bracket, you may be better off - and enjoy a yield
advantage - in an investment that is exempt from federal income taxes.
<P>

The primary intention of tax-exempt investments is to generate income
that is not subject to federal income taxes. (Income may be subject to
state and local taxes, and a portion of income may be subject to the
alternative minimum tax for certain investors.)
<P>

When you consider the federal taxes you would owe on the income you receive
from a taxable investment, you may find that you will retain more income
with a tax-exempt investment. In general, the higher your tax bracket,
the more advantageous a tax-exempt investment can be - as you will note in
the tables below. (Both tables are based on 1996 federal rates.)<BR>
<P>



<IMG SRC="gifs/taxable_charts_head.gif"
ALT="How To Compare Yields">
<BR>

<IMG SRC="gifs/taxable_chart1_head.gif"
ALT="If your adjusted gross income is less than $117,950">
<BR>

<IMG SRC="gifs/taxable1_chart.gif">

<P>
<BR><BR>

<IMG SRC="gifs/taxable_chart2_head.gif"
ALT="If your adjusted gross income is more than $117,950*">
<BR>

<IMG SRC="gifs/taxable2_chart.gif">
<P>

<FONT SIZE=-1>*This table assumes a decrease of $3.75 of itemized deductions for each $100
of adjusted gross income over $117,950. For a married couple with adjusted
gross income between $176,950 and $299,450 (single between $117,950 and
$240,450), add 0.7% to the above marginal federal tax rate for each personal and dependency
exemption. The taxable equivalent yield is the tax-exempt yield divided
by 100% minus the adjusted tax rate. For example: if the table tax rate is
37.1% and you are married with no dependents, the adjusted tax rate is
38.5% (37.1% + 0.7%+0.7%). For a tax-exempt yield of 6%, the taxable
equivalent yield is about 9.76% (6% &#247; (100%-38.5%).
<P></FONT SIZE=-1>

As shown in the tables, you would have to earn significantly higher yields
on a
taxable investment to offset the effect of the federal tax you would owe
on
your income. You would not be liable to pay federal income tax on the
 interest dividend income
you receive from the tax-exempt investment. However, for all tax exempt 
mutual funds, distribution of capital gains are considered taxable
 income to the shareholder. Please remember that
a portion of the interest dividend may be considered a tax preference 
item for purposes of the alternative minimum tax. (Of course, the yields in
the
tables are for purposes of illustration only and do not reflect the
yield of
a specific investment.)
<P>

Even though most investors prefer to avoid taxes, the tax advantage and
lower tax-exempt yields available from tax-exempt investments are not
the
best choice for all investors. For your own circumstances, be sure to
work
through the calculations shown above or consult your financial
representative.
<P>

Investors are required to disclose on their federal income tax returns
the
amount of tax-exempt interest earned during the year. In addition,
individuals whose modified income, which includes adjusted gross income,
tax-exempt interest and 50 percent of their Social Security benefits,
exceeds a base amount will be subject to federal income tax on as much
as 85
percent of their Social Security benefits.

ALT="How Kemper Shareholders
Evaluate Performance">
<BR>

<IMG SRC="gifs/evaluate_perform_subhead.gif"
ALT="What's important to
you about mutual fund performance?">
<BR>

The ultimate measure of your mutual fund is
whether it enables you to
achieve your investment goal - the purchase of a
home, the financing of
your child's education or the attainment of a
comfortable retirement.
But how do you evaluate your mutual fund's
periodic progress? What
encourages you about your fund's performance and
what discourages you?
Which of the many performance measures are
meaningful and which do you
dismiss as investment world static?
<P>

These are the questions that we sought to answer
when we recently asked
several hundred thousand Kemper mutual fund
shareholders in four equity
and three income funds to complete a Kemper Pulse
survey mailed along
with their issues of <I>Kemper Reports.</I> Response to
the survey was high,
and the results are believed to be statistically
significant and
demographically sound. Highlights of the survey
findings follow.
<P>

"On their own, survey results can't and shouldn't
dictate investment
philosophy," says Stephen B. Timbers, president
of Kemper Funds.
"But they can improve our understanding of
shareholders' expectations of
their funds, and they can help frame our
communications to investors."
<P>

<!-- question 1 -->

<IMG SRC="gifs/eval_perf_question1.gif" ALT="1">
The performance of a mutual fund can be measured
a
variety of ways. What's most important to you
about your fund?
<P>

<IMG SRC="gifs/eval_perf1_chart.gif" ALT="Chart">
<BR>

<P>

<IMG SRC="gifs/eval_perf2_chart.gif" ALT="Chart">
<BR>

<BR>

Total return is widely considered to be the best
yardstick of mutual
fund performance because it takes into account
the three components of
performance: income dividends, capital gain
dividends and changes in
the value of the fund's shares. 
<P>

<!-- question 2 -->

<IMG SRC="gifs/eval_perf_question2.gif" ALT="2">
Question #2 on the survey varied, depending on
whether it was mailed
to an income or equity fund shareholder. 
<P>

<B>Equity Funds</B>
- Individual investors have varying expectations of
their mutual funds. For example, how many years
are you prepared to give your equity fund to
appreciate in value?
<P>

<IMG SRC="gifs/eval_perf3_chart.gif" ALT="Chart">
<P>

<B>Income Funds</B>
- Individual investors have varying expectations of
their mutual funds. For example, to what extent
do you rely on your fund's dividends for your
monthly income?
<P>

<IMG SRC="gifs/eval_perf4_chart.gif" ALT="Chart">
<P>

Investors in equities are wise to give their
investment more than
five years to appreciate. The fortunes of every
company depend to
some extent upon the health of the U.S. economy.
Giving an equity
investment just one or two years to perform may
be insufficient time to
expose it to the most productive points in an
economic cycle. 
<P>

An income fund's ability to provide current
income is one of its primary
appeals. However, a mutual fund's earnings are
influenced by interest
rates and other variables that can fluctuate
significantly.

<IMG SRC="gifs/funds_vs_dividends_head.gif" ALT="The Difference Between
Mutual Fund And Stock Dividends">
<BR>

Many mutual fund shareholders mistakenly believe that a mutual fund
dividend is similar to a dividend declared by a corporation.
Corporations that pay dividends are returning a share of their profits
to their shareholders, an interim means of rewarding shareholders for
their investment. Investors have reason to be encouraged when a company
declares consecutive dividends or dividend increases. Conversely, a cut
in dividends often suggests that something is amiss.
<P>

A change in the dividend paid by a mutual fund is normally much less
meaningful. The dividend level represents the income that the fund has
earned on its investments - interest on the bonds held in an income fund
portfolio or dividends on stocks in an equity fund portfolio. Because
interest rates and the financial markets tend to move in cycles, you can
always expect some fluctuation in the income earned by your fund.
Regardless of these fluctuations, mutual funds distribute substantially
all of their income annually in order to avoid paying income tax on
their earnings.
<P>

When interest rates rise and a fund can earn more on its underlying
investments, the dividends it pays may be expected to rise. By the same
token, a drop in interest rates over an extended period of time will
result in a reduction in the interest income earned by a fund. This
decline in income earned may result in the fund being forced to cut the
dividends paid to shareholders.
<P>

Dividend income is only one way that your investment in a mutual fund
can grow. You also have the opportunity to receive capital gains
distributions, which are distributions of any profits that your fund
earns when it sells securities. Another possibility is the capital gain
(or loss) you experience when you sell your shares at a higher (or
lower) share price than your cost per share.

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<IMG SRC="gifs/whats_yield_head.gif" ALT="What's In A Yield?">
<BR>

How much income will your investment yield? That is a difficult question
to answer - although some investments promise a fixed return over a
specific period of time, mutual funds do not, and you cannot consider
past yield of a mutual fund a reliable predictor of future results. 
<P>

But if only for the purpose of comparing one investment choice with
another, it makes sense to pay attention to the stated yield of an
investment. Mutual fund companies and depository institutions follow
both regulation and convention in describing an investment's yield.
Below we take a closer look at the various yields that you may see
mentioned in sales literature or advertisements.
<P>

Annual percentage yield (APY): Income earned on a bank deposit (a
certificate of deposit or money market deposit account, for example) is
described as an annual percentage yield. The yield reflects the total
amount of interest paid on a deposit account, based on the interest rate
and the frequency of compounding for a 365-day period. 
<P>

<IMG SRC="gifs/apy_chart.gif">

<P>

Current yield: You will see a current - or seven-day - yield mentioned in
money market fund advertising. This yield represents one week's income
annualized as of a specific date. It does not include realized or
unrealized gains and losses. 
<P>

<IMG SRC="gifs/current_yield_chart.gif">

<P>

Effective yield: Effective yield, in the context of fixed-price
investments such as money market funds or certificates of deposit,
includes the effect of compounding net investment income. That's why an
effective yield will be higher than a quoted yield. To understand the
difference between the yield quoted on an investment and its effective
yield, find out how frequently the income is assumed to be compounded.
You'll note a greater difference when income is compounded weekly than
quarterly or semiannually. And, remember that effective yield
presupposes that you reinvest all your income and that interest rates
remain constant. 
<P>

Current distribution rate: Current distribution rate is simply a measure
of the level of dividends distributed by a mutual fund for a specified
period. It may sometimes be greater than the fund's yield because, for
instance, it may include gains from the sale of short-term investments
and possibly long-term gains (which may be non-recurring). 
<P>

<IMG SRC="gifs/dist_rate_chart.gif">

<P>

SEC yield: The Securities and Exchange Commission requires all income
mutual funds to calculate a yield using the same standardized formula.
According to the formula (which is included in Kemper funds' 
"Statement of Additional Information" or Part B), the SEC yield is net
investment income per share earned over a specific month, expressed as
an annualized percentage of the fund's maximum offering price (the
fund's per share net asset value plus the maximum applicable sales
charge) on the last day of that month. 
<P>

Taxable-equivalent yield: You'll find a taxable-equivalent yield cited in
material that accompanies investments in municipal bonds and mutual
funds that seek to earn income exempt from federal taxes. The stated or
coupon yield of these investments will likely be lower than the yield of
investments that are taxable. However, it's possible to calculate a
tax-equivalent yield that represents the yield that you would have to
earn on a fully taxable investment before taxes to match the yield on a
tax-free investment. The marketing materials will tell you the federal
(and state, if applicable) tax rates used as a basis for calculating the
taxable-equivalent yield.
<P>

<IMG SRC="gifs/tax_yield_chart.gif">

<P>

<I>This article was excerpted from the Winter/Spring 1995 issue of </I>Kemper
Reports,<I> Kemper's quarterly shareholder magazine.</I>
<P>

<IMG SRC="gifs/whats_yield_subhead.gif" ALT="Total Return Defined">
<BR>

Although yield will give you an idea of the income being generated by
your investment, total return is considered one of the best measures of the overall
performance of most mutual fund investments. (Because money market funds
seek to maintain a constant $1.00 share price, yield is the usual
measure of their performance.)
<P>

Total return is a measure of the income earned by the fund's
investments, plus the effect of any realized and unrealized appreciation
or depreciation of the investments, during a stated period of time,
assuming the reinvestment of all dividends. While yield measures only
the income component of your fund shares, total return considers three
components: income dividends, capital gain dividends and changes in the
value of your shares.

Don't Read The Prospectus">
<BR>

Every mutual fund shareholder has been provided with a prospectus at one
time or another. Ah, but have you read the prospectus?
<P>

Mutual fund prospectuses may look drearily alike but each fund company
uses the prospectus to describe its own investment policies and
practices. Most practices are reasonable and easy to understand - even
so, you'll be better off knowing them sooner rather than later. 
<P>

Here's a short list of what you might miss if you don't read the
prospectus:
<P>

<UL>
<LI> Some fund companies assess a fee every time you reinvest your
dividends.
<LI> Some fund companies assess a fee if you redeem your shares before a
prescribed time period.
<LI> Some fund companies impose a 30-day or longer waiting period before
they'll exchange your shares from one fund into another.
<LI> Some funds insist on the right to pay your redemption proceeds in
"marketable securities" instead of cash in the case of large
redemptions.

Investing">

Some of the best things you can do for yourself - eating vegetables,
flossing your teeth and investing regularly - are the most difficult
habits to develop. None provides immediate gratification, and some are
downright disagreeable. There's no sugar surge from vegetables. Flossing
can be irritating. And when you invest a portion of your income, that
money is not available for you to spend. What, then, is the incentive to
adopt these good habits? 
<P>

The payback for a lifetime of eating peas (and Brussels sprouts and
asparagus and broccoli) is good health. Wedging that floss in and out of
your teeth can spare you the expense and discomfort of repeated
visits to the dentist. And people who invest regularly find their
motivation by in the potential for positive long-term results.
Although you can be given no guarantees, the decision to adopt a regular
investment plan can be the beginning of yet another habit that can be
good for you. 
<P>

Where do your investment dollars come from? Really, there are only two
possibilities. 
<P>

You might have a sizable amount of money (which we'll call a lump sum)
that you want to put to work toward a short-term goal, such as the
purchase of a home, or a long-term goal, such as your retirement. Lump
sums can drop into your lap for any number of reasons - possibly you
have earned a bonus, received an inheritance or settled an insurance
claim. No matter how it gets there, a lump sum distribution is an
occasion that requires an investment decision.
<P>

But lump sum payments are infrequent occurrences. If you're like most
people, any money that you have to invest must come from your current
income. You may use your income for other obligations and expenses, but
if you're going to invest for your future, you're going to have do so
out of today's income. Here's where you need discipline to develop the good
habit to invest regularly. 
<P>

It's the enviable person who can sit down, pay his bills, buy what he
wants and still have money left. It's the admirable person who follows
through by taking the money that's left and investing it. It's the rare
person, indeed, who follows this regime every pay period. 
<P>

The rest of us need the discipline of an automatic investment program.
Simply, an automatic investment program requires you to make the
decision to invest once. Once you've decided that you want to start
investing now - as opposed to waiting for that day some point in the
future when you get your lump sum - the automatic investment program can
take care of the rest. 
<P>

Where does your income come from? Whether it's from a paycheck, a
government payment or a bank account, you can establish a regular
program that will directly and automatically transfer a certain amount
into a mutual fund account. All you need to do is provide instructions
about how much should be moved and into which fund account on what date.
<P>

A program of automatic investing is easy to initiate, and this good
habit can start with a relatively small sacrifice on your part. (At
Kemper, the minimum monthly investment is $50.) 
<P>

In addition, a regular plan helps you develop a certain nonchalance.
Once you've arranged to invest a fixed amount every paycheck or every
month, you don't need to worry whether it's a "good" or "bad" time to be
making an investment. When prices are high, your fixed investment will
buy fewer shares of your fund than when prices are low. Of course, when
the price of your fund shares is low, you'll be able to accumulate more
shares. Market fluctuations shouldn't concern a regular investor with a
long-term investment horizon.
<P>

You should realize, however, that an automatic investment program cannot
assure a profit or protect against loss in a declining market. Since
this type of program involves continuous investment regardless of
fluctuating share values, you'll need to consider your financial ability
to continue the program through periods of low price levels.
<P>

<IMG SRC="gifs/autoinvesting_subhead.gif" ALT="Could you use another good habit?">
<BR>
 As a Kemper shareholder, you have your choice of three <A HREF="../shareholders/forms.html">
 automatic investment programs.</A>* All are free of charge.
<P>

<UL TYPE=CIRCLE>
<LI> You can arrange to have all or a portion of your paycheck invested
directly into a Kemper fund.
<LI> You can automatically invest directly from your checking account.
Just
select the day each month that your money should be transferred to your
mutual fund account from your checking or savings account at any bank,
savings institution or credit union.**
<LI> If you receive Social Security checks or other regular payments
from
the U.S. government or any of its agencies, you can automatically invest
all or a portion of your government check directly into a 	Kemper fund.
<P>
</UL>

*Investments may be subject to a sales charge. Please consult your
prospectus for additional information.
<BR>
**In order for you to establish a Bank Direct Deposit plan, your
financial institution must be a member of the Automated Clearing House
Association. Note that mutual fund shares are not insured or guaranteed
as bank products are, and mutual funds present a greater risk to
capital.

<IMG SRC="gifs/track_investment_head.gif" ALT="Tracking Your Kemper Fund
Investment">
<BR>

To keep an eye on the progress of your investment, you can turn to many sources
of information. Here's a quick review of what Kemper provides:
<P>

<LI TYPE=CIRCLE> <B>Your quarterly statement.</B> You'll find your fund's year-to-date
total return through the end of the previous month and its average
annual
total returns as of the closing date of the previous quarter shown in
the fund summary of your quarterly statement. 
<P>

Total return and average annual total return are a measure of net
investment income and capital gain or loss from portfolio investments,
assuming that dividends are reinvested. While total returns are not
adjusted, average annual total returns are adjusted for the maximum
sales charge or the contingent deferred sales charge in effect at the
end of the period. Average annual total return reflects annualized
change while total return reflects aggregate change. 
<P>

Our goal is to mail your statement as close to the end of the quarter as
possible, which restricts our ability to print your fund's returns as of
the date of the close of that quarter. 
<P>
 
<LI TYPE=CIRCLE> <B> KemperACCESS.</B> For up-to-date Kemper fund and account information 24
hours a day, seven days a week, call our automated telephone response
system. By calling 1-800-972-3060 on a touch-tone telephone, you can
receive the following information:
<P>

<LI TYPE=CIRCLE> Account balance <BR>
<LI TYPE=CIRCLE> Most recent transactions <BR>
<LI TYPE=CIRCLE> Dividend earnings <BR>
<LI TYPE=CIRCLE> Current yields and returns <BR>
<LI TYPE=CIRCLE> Current net asset values <BR>
<BR>

Selected account transactions also are available.
<P>

Are you a first-time caller? Don't be stumped when asked to enter your
Personal Identification Number (PIN) - your PIN is the last four digits
of your Social Security number. (You can change your PIN by following
KemperACCESS instructions.)
<P>

<LI TYPE=CIRCLE> <B><I>Instant Profiles.</I></B> This quarterly publication presents performance
data about each fund in the Kemper family of funds. Asset size,
portfolio
composition and applicable duration and maturity information also are
reported. 
<P>

<LI TYPE=CIRCLE> <B>Annual and semiannual shareholder reports.</B> A comprehensive report
of your fund's six-month performance is mailed to you twice a year. In
it
you will find an economic overview from Kemper's chief investment
officer, a question-and-answer with the fund's portfolio manager and
detailed performance and financial data.
<P>

Reminder: Please remember that the performance of your individual
investment may differ from the total return reported by your fund. The
total return on your investment will depend on when you purchased your
shares, at what price and how you handle dividends and other
distributions. Your financial representative is the best source you can

<IMG SRC="gifs/sig_guarantee_head.gif" ALT="What's A Signature Guarantee?">
<BR>

As a precaution against those who have no right to your invested
dollars, there are many circumstances when Kemper will require you to
provide a signature guarantee.
<P>

A signature guarantee is a certification that attests to the genuineness
of your signature. The financial institution that you obtain the
guarantee from - which could be a commercial bank, trust company,
federal savings bank, savings institution, member of a national
securities exchange or other type of eligible financial institution -
warrants that you as the signer are an "appropriate" person and that you
have "legal capacity" to sign. 
<P>

This certification goes beyond what a notary public provides. A notary
attests only to the fact that he or she witnessed an individual sign a
document. Because a notary public does not guarantee that the individual
who signed the document truly is who he or she says he is, Kemper does
not accept a notarized document where a signature guarantee is required.
<P>

These are a few examples of when you'll be asked to provide a signature
guarantee:
<P>

<UL>
<LI> When you request any change in the registration of your mutual fund
account. 
<LI> When you add certain privileges to an existing account.
<LI> When you redeem more than $50,000 from your account or when you redeem
any amount and request that the check be mailed to a different address
than is shown on the account's registration.
<LI> When you redeem an account and request that the check be mailed to an
address that has been changed within the previous 30 days.
</UL>

<IMG SRC="gifs/waiveexp_head.gif"
ALT="Why Mutual Funds Waive Expenses">
<BR>
Mutual funds pursuing the same investment objective can be compared on the basis of any number of characteristics. A significant difference between their returns, however, may be a sign that a fund is either having its operating expenses absorbed or management fees waived by its investment advisor. Although they're often offered on equity funds, you're most likely to notice the effect of an absorption or waiver in the yields of a bond or money market mutual fund.  Their presence can explain how a fund is able to provide a relatively higher return to shareholders.

<P>

A look at the fund's Summary of Expenses, which is included near the front of every mutual fund prospectus, usually will reveal whether expenses are being absorbed or fees are being waived. A footnote to the summary should disclose the existence and effects of an absorption or a waiver. The Financial Highlights of a fund, included in both the prospectus and fund financial statements, also show what the expense ratio and net investment income ratio would be with and without the waivers. This information will give you some idea of how the waivers affect performance. 

<P>

Investment advisors are most likely to absorb out-of-pocket expenses or to waive management fees when they have just introduced a fund. Although every fund is capitalized with seed money from the investment advisor, one of its goals is to grow as soon as possible. Every fund needs to attain a certain size in order to initiate investments, diversify and properly pursue its investment strategy.  One of the best ways of attracting new assets is by lowering shareholder expenses and fees. 

<P>

The decision of how much to absorb and/or waive -- and for how long -- is more art than science. The difference must be enough to serve as an incentive. A new income fund whose fees and/or expenses are being waived may offer a 40 to 80 basis point (0.40 percent to .80 percent) yield advantage, for example. This tends to be sufficient to attract new shareholders.

<P>

Waivers typically remain in place for a limited time, after which the investment advisor will gradually reinstate the waived costs and fees to the fund. It is hoped that the fund will be large enough to better absorb the waived fees by the time they are added back.

<P>

Such waivers are common with fund introductions. Some investment advisors also make a practice of waiving the expenses and fees of a more mature fund. When this is done and the fund is thereby able to produce a higher yield, the investment advisor is making a marketing decision to incur the fund's expenses and forgo fee income in favor of asset growth for the fund. The reason for this strategy is that a larger fund will provide certain economies of scale that should lead to reduced ongoing costs. You should know, though, that an investment advisor typically reserves the right to stop the practice and reinstate the fund's true expenses and fees at any time.

<IMG SRC="gifs/rainy_day_head.gif" ALT="Do You Need A Rainy Day Fund?">
<BR>

By definition, an emergency - an automobile accident, a sudden illness,
the loss of a job - is something that's not planned. You can plan how
you're going to finance your child's education and you can prepare for
your eventual retirement, but how do you know how much money you might
need in the case of an emergency? It's impossible to know.
<P>

Yet the inability to predict exactly how much you may need should not
have the effect of discouraging your planning - sooner or later a little
rain is going to fall in everyone's life. When you experience the sudden
occurrence of an event that requires significant financial resources,
you're going to want a rainy day fund.
<P>

What's a rainy day fund? It's a sum of money that you set aside to be
available when you need it. The rain may fall at any point, and your
fund should help bail you out. Once you decide to establish a rainy day
fund, the next two questions are: How much do you need to set aside and
where will you keep it?
<P>

As a general rule, some experts recommend that you keep the equivalent
of your net income for three to six months in a readily available
source. If you lose your job, for example, the rainy day fund should
shield you from the elements until you can find a new one. (You may need
to increase the amount of your reserve if you think that it will take
longer than six months to get a new job.) 
<P>

Projecting the amount of income you'd expect to have to replace will
give you one measure of how much you should have set aside. An
alternative is to estimate the total expenses you'd need to meet while
you were out of work or in the midst of any other financial crisis.
<P>

Where will you keep your rainy day money? These are a few points to
consider when evaluating the suitability of a money market fund and an
account at a financial institution:
<P>

<UL TYPE=CIRCLE>

<LI TYPE=CIRCLE> <B>Stability.</B> Remember that the purpose of this rainy day money
is to
give you peace of mind at a time when you're likely to be experiencing
stress. An emergency is no time to find out that the dollars you're
counting on using have dwindled. 
<P>

Given their potential for price fluctuation, certain types of mutual
funds
may not be appropriate investments for an emergency fund. Money market
funds, 
however, can be an alternative to financial institution accounts.
<P>

Money market funds are neither insured nor guaranteed by the U.S.
government and there can be no assurance that a stable net asset value
of $1 per share will be maintained. Money market shares represent a
greater risk to capital than certificates of deposit or savings
accounts.
While principal and interest in a savings account with a financial
institution is guaranteed, and the account is generally insured by the
Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation. 
<P>

<LI TYPE=CIRCLE> <B>Access.</B> The checkwriting privilege available with money
market funds
assures you immediate access to your rainy day fund no matter what time
the rain falls. Access to savings accounts will vary from financial
institution to financial institution. If you keep invest your money in a
certificate of deposit, however, remember that you may be subject to a
penalty for early withdrawal.
<P>

<LI TYPE=CIRCLE> <B>Yield.</B> Unlike other investments you have, the earning
ability of your
rainy day fund may be of less concern to you. However, there are
important differences between mutual fund and financial institution
accounts. 

</UL>


Money market funds, such as those offered by Kemper, seek to maximize
current income while maintaining the stability of the principal. Money
market fund yields generally fluctuate daily, responding to changes in
prevailing interest rates. Mutual funds are required to distribute
substantially all of their income. Bank products offer fixed or variable
yields that are set by the financial institution and changed at its
discretion. 
<P>

prospectus in addition to those you
already have, please call Kemper Shareholder Services at 1-800-621-1048, 
or <A HREF="../prospectus.html">request one now.</A>
The prospectus contains more complete information including management
fees and expenses. Please read it carefully before you invest or send
money.

<IMG SRC="gifs/dontdaydream_head.gif" ALT="Do's And Don'ts For Daydreamers">
<BR>

It's Saturday morning and you're indulging in a little daydreaming.
While your financial advisors would prefer to think that you're dreaming
about financing your retirement, your dream this morning is about how to
get that new car...or how to swing a week or two in the islands...or how
to achieve just about any number of short-term investment goals.
<P>

At one point or another, we all have to make some decisions about how to
invest for the short term. In the case of a bonus or inheritance or lump
sum distribution, you may have a plan for how you're going to use money
that suddenly becomes available - yet you don't want it sitting idle in
the interim. On the other hand, you may want to set aside funds toward a
certain goal you expect to reach in the not-so-distant future, such as a
new car or vacation, and you want them to be earning until you need to
access it.
<P>

What do you do? Whatever you do (and you'll want to consult your
financial representative for specific advice), be sure to recognize that
your approach to investing for the short-term will vary somewhat from
what you'd do as a long-term investor.
<P>

<B>These are just a few points that you'll want to keep in mind:</B>
<P>

<UL TYPE=CIRCLE>
<LI> In all likelihood, you are counting on a specific dollar amount to
achieve your goal. The stability of your principal, then, will have to
be more important to you than its return. Remember that the pursuit of
higher returns implies a higher level of risk. Because of your imminent
need for your money, you may not be able to withstand the degree of
volatility that would be acceptable to someone who has committed his or
her funds for the long term. You'll need an investment whose objective
is preservation of capital.
<P>

<LI> Access may be more important to you as a short-term investor. You'll
want to avoid investments that restrict (and these restrictions could be
in the form of penalties on withdrawals or limited service hours) your
ability to withdraw funds at any time. 
<P>

<LI> Pay attention to the fees that accompany investments. The fee
structure of some investments assumes that you have an extended
investment horizon and expect to remain invested for years. 
<P>
</UL>

That's true, for example, of mutual fund shares purchased in Class A and
Class B of Kemper mutual funds. Class C shares of Kemper funds may be
most appropriate for investors who anticipate a relatively short
investment period. 
<P>

Investors in Class A shares pay an upfront sales charge, and investors
in Class B shares purchase their shares with the understanding that
redemptions during the first six years may be subject to a contingent
deferred sales charge. Class B shares also pay an annual distribution
services fee of 0.75 percent for six years. Class C provides an
alternative for those who want to be able to redeem their shares at any
time without charge. In lieu of a sales charge, an annual distribution
services charge of 0.75 percent is assessed on Class C shares. (These
somewhat higher expenses will result in lower income and capital gain
distributions on a per share basis than are earned on Class A shares,
and the distribution fee for Class C shares remains in place regardless
of how long a shareholder owns the shares.) 
<P>

To obtain a Kemper Funds prospectus in addition to those you
already have, please call Kemper Shareholder Services at 1-800-621-1048, 
or <A HREF="../prospectus.html">request one now.</A>

fees and expenses. Please read it carefully before you invest or send

In The Door">
<BR>

If you're saving to buy a home, the down payment on your purchase will
most likely be your first and largest hurdle. But, if you're like most
home buyers, the spending doesn't stop once you've crossed the threshold
to your new home.
<P>

Then you'll need funds for furnishings (furniture, household
decorations, kitchen housewares and floor and window coverings) and
improvements such as landscaping and the building of patios, fences and
driveways.
<P>

According to calculations by the National Association of Home Builders,
in the first three months after their purchase, new homeowners spend 25 to
35 percent more of their income each month than non-moving homeowners
do. This burst of spending, which continues but at a slower pace for the
next several months, totals an estimated $6,475 in the first full year
after the purchase.

<BR>


The American dream of taking the wheel of a brand new automobile and
heading down the highway has become a dream less available to the middle
class. 
<P>

According to Zurich Kemper Investments Economist David Hale, auto prices have
risen so sharply during recent years that today's new auto buyer has an
average income that's about 40 percent above the national median
household income. Ten years ago, new auto buyers had a household income
that was about 20 percent above the national median, according to Hale. 
<P>

For the would-be car buyer, these higher auto prices may require a more
planned, longer term investment strategy. To the economy and to auto
manufacturers, Hale says, "This compression in the share of population
now able to qualify for new auto purchases has greatly increased the
sensitivity of auto sales to factors that influence the income or
confidence of people in the top income quintile of the population." The
1995 income tax hike, for example, hurt upper-income Americans and
resulted in an auto slump, Hale says.

<IMG SRC="gifs/mmfbalan_head.gif" ALT="Money Market Funds Balance Income, Stability">
<BR>

Many people know that a money market mutual fund strives to maintain a $1.00 net asset value per share. But how is this accomplished? Understanding how a money market mutual fund "works" requires some consideration of its investments.

<P>

A money market fund typically has two objectives: to generate income and to 
preserve principal, which is represented by net asset value (NAV). The desire to preserve principal guides the fund manager's selection of income-producing investments -- a money fund invests in high quality, short-term securities. The high quality is intended to help guard the fund against credit risk while short maturities are intended to help reduce exposure to interest rate risk.  

<P>

These are a few of the possible investments that a money market fund might include in its portfolio:

<P>

<LI TYPE=CIRCLE> <B>Obligations of or guaranteed by the U.S. government, its agencies or instrumentalities.</B> 
Short-term government obligations are considered to be the safest short-term investments. 
(Of course, any U.S. government guarantee of the securities owned by the portfolio does not guarantee the 
net asset value of its shares.) 
<P>
<LI TYPE=CIRCLE> <B>Commercial paper obligations with very high ratings.</B> This is a form of unsecured 
debt issued by corporations -- their good name and financial strength is the 
investor's security. Commercial paper can range in maturity from 1 to 270 days, with the interest rate generally rising with the time to maturity. 
<P>
<LI TYPE=CIRCLE> <B>Bank certificates of deposit (CDs).</B> A money market mutual fund will often purchase 
large denomination ($100,000-plus) bank CDs. The rate of return on a CD is commensurate with its size and length 
of term to maturity. 
<P>
<LI TYPE=CIRCLE> <B>Repurchase agreements.</B> In a repurchase agreement  (also called a repo), the money fund will buy primarily U.S. government or agency obligations from a dealer on the condition that the dealer will repurchase the security back at a mutually agreed upon time and price. Such an agreement enables the manager to "lock in" a maturity and yield.
<P>
The short-term nature of the investments in the portfolio requires continual monitoring of events. Fiscal policy (such as federal taxation and spending plans), monetary policy (particularly the Federal Reserve Board's action on interest rates) and legislative policy also can influence how a money fund manager will invest.

<P>
If a manager expects interest rates to rise, the fund might have a much shorter average maturity -- so when 
assets are sold, the proceeds can be invested at the higher rates. On the other hand, if the forecast calls for a decline in interest rates, the manager might want to invest in longer maturity investments to benefit from higher interest rates as long as possible. Again, all investment decisions are based within the framework of preserving principal.

Please read it carefully before you invest or send money.</I>

<P>

<I>An investment in a money market fund is neither insured nor guaranteed by the U.S. government, and there 
can be no assurance that the fund will be able to maintain a stable net asset value of $1.00 per share.</I>

What's one of the best gifts you can give your child? Parents who teach
their children "that money you put away is not gone forever" have
significantly influenced their children's retirement savings habits,
according to B. Douglas Bernheim, an academic economist at Stanford
University. 
<P>

Bernheim says his research has demonstrated a strong link between
childhood experiences and adult behavior. Specifically, individuals who
were encouraged to maintain a bank account as a child saved 108 percent
more for their retirement when they became adults than those who did not
have a childhood bank account. Children who received allowances saved 36
percent more as adults, according to Bernheim.
<P>

If you'd like to use a mutual fund to reinforce the importance of
investing for tomorrow, it is possible to establish an account in the
child's name. The account will be set up according to the rules of the
Uniform Gift to Minors Act (UGMA) or Uniform Transfer to Minors Act
(UTMA). The custodian you select when establishing the gift account will
have exclusive control of the investment until the child comes of age
(age 18 or 21 depending upon your state of residence). However,
duplicate copies of the quarterly statement can be mailed to the child.
And, of course, the child can participate by monitoring the progress of
his or her investment every day in the newspaper, on financial
television programs or via on-line computer services. 
<P>

<BR>

Junior year. Years ago it was considered the best year in high school -
those gawky years were all but forgotten but it was still too soon to
fret about college. Unfortunately, that's not the case today - at least
not for the parents of a high school junior. In fact, some financial
planning should take place when the student is a sophomore.
<P>

The year before a student heads for college is the pivotal year used by
many financial aid officers to determine financial aid eligibility. Your
income and assets will be reviewed each year but the so-called first
base income year is the one that sets the precedent. The base year
starts on January 1 of the student's junior year to December 31 of that
year (when, if all has gone well, the student is halfway through senior
year).
<P>

The following are a few tips from the <I>Detroit News-Free Press</I> on how to
improve your chances for qualifying for aid:
<P>

<UL TYPE=CIRCLE>
<LI> Cash in U.S. savings bonds earmarked for college before the base
income year begins. Once the cash is in the bank, it's considered an
asset, not income. Financial aid offices expect parents to devote as
much as 47 percent of their income to college but only 5.65 percent of
their assets.
<LI> If you usually get large income tax refunds, reduce your withholding
the year before the base income year. Refunds show up as income the
following year for taxpayers who itemize.
<LI> Try to have bonuses paid in a year other than the base income year.
Avoid all pension or IRA distributions.
</UL>

There are many gifts you can give a special youngster, but very few have
the potential to appreciate over time. A Kemper fund investment
provides the opportunity to grow with a child - without getting lost,
broken or forgotten as the child matures.
<P>

Whether your gift will help finance college or other future needs, a
mutual fund can be one of the most significant gifts a child can receive
because the more time it has to grow, the greater value a mutual fund
can potentially provide.
<P>

Kemper offers several mutual funds that could be well suited for a
child's portfolio because of their long-term investment objectives. And,
according to the Uniform Gift to Minors Act (UGMA) or Uniform Transfer
to Minors Act (UTMA), a mutual fund gift to a child can provide certain
tax benefits, based on current law in most states.
<P>

For more information about giving the gift of a Kemper fund, please call 
your financial representative or Kemper Shareholder Services 1-800-621-1048. 
We'll be happy to send you a gift kit, including  
<A HREF="../prospectus.html">prospectuses</A> containing more complete details 
about custodial accounts and an attractive gift card and envelope.

Fund Compares With The Gift Of A U.S. Savings Bond">
<BR>

Many parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles have traditionally given
U.S. savings bonds to children. U.S. savings bonds can be given directly
or transferred according to the rules of the Uniform Gift to Minors Act
(UGMA) or Uniform Transfer to Minors Act (UTMA). The only way to give a
Kemper fund gift to a child is to establish an UGMA/UTMA account.
Here's how the gift of a U.S. savings bond compares to the gift of a
Kemper fund account.

At one end of the risk/return spectrum are funds whose primary objective is the growth of capital (<A HREF="../funds/smallcapequity.html">Kemper Small Capitalization Equity Fund</A>, <A HREF="../funds/smallcapequity.html">Kemper-Dreman Small Cap Value Fund</A>, <A HREF="../funds/technology.html">Kemper Technology Fund</A> and <A HREF="../funds/asian_growth.html">Kemper Asian Growth Fund</A>). At the other end of the risk/return spectrum are <A HREF="../funds/mmfunds.html">Kemper money market funds</A> whose objective is maximum current income consistent with the stability of principal. 
<BR><BR>
Mutual funds are neither insured nor guaranteed by the U.S. government and present greater risk to capital than U.S. savings bonds. Returns and net asset value will fluctuate. Money market funds seek to maintain a stable $1 share value, although there can be no assurance that they will. Investment by <A HREF="../funds/smallcapequity.html">Kemper Small Capitalization Equity Fund</A>, <A HREF="../funds/smallcapequity.html">Kemper-Dreman Small Cap Value Fund</A> and <A HREF="../funds/technology.html">Kemper Technology Fund</A> in smaller companies presents greater risk than an investment in larger, more established companies. Also, investment in international securities presents special risk considerations including exchange rates, government regulations and differences in liquidity.

A savings bond is purchased at half its face value or denomination and
it is guaranteed to accrue interest  until it equals its face value.
<BR><BR>
Previously, a guaranteed minimum interest rate enabled investors to
project how long they'd need to hold the bond before it reached its
value. Starting May 1, 1995, the U.S. Treasury abandoned its practice of
offering a guaranteed minimum rate in favor of "market-based rates" that
will be set on May 1 and November 1 of every year. 
<BR><BR>
On savings bonds less than five years old, the U.S. Treasury pays 85 percent
of the average of six-month Treasury security yields or 4.56 percent
as of November 1, 1996. Rates paid on savings bonds that are five years or older are
85% of the average of five-year Treasury security yields or 5.53 percent
as of November 1, 1996.
<BR><BR>
If a savings bond earning market rates has not reached face value after
17 years, the government will make a one-time adjustment to make the
redemption value at least equal to the face amount.

Previously, interest on the U.S. savings bond was credited monthly.
Starting with savings bonds sold on May 1, 1995, interest is credited
six months after its issue date and every six months thereafter. The

dates will not receive interest for the partial period.

<IMG SRC="gifs/tax_consgift_head.gif" ALT="What Are The Tax Consequences
For Gift-Givers?">
<BR>

Both the gift of a mutual fund and the gift of a U.S. savings bond
qualify for the $10,000 annual gift tax exclusion. If your spouse
consents and you file IRS Form 709 (this form can be retrieved from the <A HREF="http://www.irs.ustreas.gov/prod/cover.html">IRS web site</A>), 
you and your spouse may give up to
$20,000 per year tax-free to each child.

<P>

In addition, the establishment of an UGMA/UTMA for a mutual fund gift
(which is the only way an investment in a Kemper fund can be
given to a child) or for a U.S. savings bond provides certain tax
benefits. If you establish an UGMA/UTMA and as long as the child's
income tax return is filed separately from yours, the first $650 in
earnings from your gift is tax-free until the year in which the child
turns 14. The second $650 in earnings from the gift is taxed at the
child's income tax rate which, presumably, is the lowest federal tax
rate of 15 percent. Any earnings above $1,300 are taxed at the parent's
income tax rate (subject to annual adjustment for inflation). 

<P>

After the child reaches 14, all income beyond the first $650 in earnings
from the gift is taxed at his or her income tax rate. These rules apply
regardless of who makes the gift.  

<P>

You should note that there are additional tax benefits available to a
U.S. savings bondholder, whether the bond is received directly or
through the UGMA/UTMA. For example, earnings on U.S. savings bonds are
free of state and local taxes. Also, the bondholder can choose to
declare earned interest each year or defer declaring the interest until
the bond is redeemed or the date interest stops accruing, which is after
30 years.  

<P>

There are some mutual funds that invest in municipal bonds (click here to learn about <A HREF="../funds/taxfree.html">Kemper Tax-Free Income Funds</A>) and offer
income free of federal and, in some cases, state and local taxes. A
portion of the income may be subject to the alternative minimum tax for
certain investors. The appropriateness of investing in such mutual funds
may depend on the child's income tax rate. 

<P>

For more information about giving the gift of a Kemper fund, <A HREF="../learn/contact_learn.html">send us an e-mail now</A> or call your financial representative or Kemper Shareholder Services
at (800) 621-1048. We'll be happy to send you a gift kit, including 
<A HREF="../prospectus.html">prospectuses</A> 
containing more complete details about the funds, including
charges and expenses, additional information about custodial accounts
and a convenient gift card and envelope. Please be sure to read the
prospectus carefully before you invest or send money.

If you had invested $1,000 in U.S. savings bonds 20 years ago, you would
have been guaranteed a steady increase in your investment. No such
assurance was available from the stock market, as you can see from the
up and down performance of the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index. However,
the return on $1,000 invested in the stock market, as represented by the
S&amp;P 500, would have been more than three times the return on the U.S.
savings bonds. The data for both the U.S. savings bonds and the S&amp;P
500 track the performance of $1,000 invested from October 1, 1976, through
September 30, 1996.
<P>

This information is historical and does not represent future performance
of the S&amp;P 500 index or U.S. savings bonds. The <A HREF="http://www.stockinfo.standardpoor.com/brochure/idxdirs.htm">S&amp;P 500</A> is an
unmanaged index of common stocks that's generally considered representative of the
U.S. stock market. The performance of the index is not intended to be representative of the past or future performance of any Kemper <A HREF="../funds/capgrowth.html">capital growth fund.</A> There are important differences between the S&amp;P 500 stocks and U.S. savings bonds. For example,
stocks have fluctuating investment return and principal while a U.S. savings bond has a fixed principal and is guaranteed by the U.S. government to accrue interest until the principal and accrued interest equal the face value of the savings bond.

A calculator available through the <A HREF="http://www.ny.frb.org:/pihome/svg_bnds/index.html">

<IMG SRC="gifs/factscustodial_head.gif" ALT="About Custodial
Accounts">
<BR>

It's easy to open a gift account at Kemper. And, if the gift is
established to meet the requirements of your state's Uniform Gift to
Minors Act (UGMA) or Uniform Transfer to Minors Act (UTMA), it can enjoy
unique tax benefits. According to current Uniform Gift rules, you can
open a mutual fund account in a child's name and designate yourself, a
spouse or a friend to administer it until the youngster reaches adult
age. It is not necessary that the custodian be a parent.
<P>

<B>Q: How do I establish a gift account with Kemper?</B><BR>
<B>A:</B> Simply obtain the child's Social Security number and appoint a
custodian to manage the account. Complete a new account application,
making certain to check the box in Section 1, "Gift to a Minor," and
enter the names of the custodian and minor where indicated.
<P>

The minimum investment amount for a custodial account is $1,000 unless
you establish an <A HREF="autoinvesting.html">automatic investment plan</A>, in which case you can set up
an account for as little as $50. If you choose to establish an automatic
investment plan, be sure to complete Section 12 on the application.
<P><BR>

<B>Q: What are the responsibilities of the custodian?</B> <BR>
<B>A:</B> The custodian for the account controls the money - how it is
invested
and spent - until the child legally comes of age. In most cases, the
legal age is 18 or 21 for the purposes of the Uniform Acts. However,
some states allow custodianship to extend beyond the age of majority. 
<P>

Here's a tip to bear in mind: As a parent, if you name yourself as
custodian and you die before your child becomes an adult (an adult is
often defined by the statutes as either age 18 or 21), the value of the gift account may be
included as part of your estate for federal tax purposes. In this case, you
may wish to consult your tax advisor about alternatives such as naming
some person other than yourself as custodian. Or, if you and your spouse make the gift
jointly, consider a third-party custodian.
<P><BR>

<B>Q: What happens when the child reaches the age of majority?</B> <BR>
<B>A:</B> When the child reaches the adult age designated by the state
for
ending the custodianship, the assets are his or hers to spend or to
invest in any way. The money you invest on behalf of a child is
considered an irrevocable gift. The account you've established in one
child's name, for example, cannot be transferred to the name of another
minor.
<P><BR>

<B>Q: What Kemper funds may I establish a gift account in?</B> <BR>
<B>A:</B> Kemper offers a range of funds that could be well suited for a
child's portfolio. <A HREF="../funds/spectrum.html">(Click here to view the Kemper Funds Risk/Return Spectrum.)</A> Your financial representative can help answer your
specific investing questions.
<P><BR>

<B>Q: What are the tax benefits of establishing a gift account for a
child?</B> <BR>
<B>A:</B> For children under the age of 14, the Internal Revenue Service
treats
a child's first $650 of unearned income ("unearned" means not
representing compensation for services) as tax-free. The second $650 of
unearned income is taxed at the child's marginal tax rate of 15 percent.
Any unearned income over $1,300 is taxed at the parent's top marginal
tax rate. (The parent's rate applies even if the gift comes from someone
else). This means that for an investment earning a hypothetical 8
percent* annually, you could have up to $16,250 in the child's name and
still qualify for favorable tax treatment on the $1,300 of income. For
children 14 years and older (at the end of the tax year), all earnings
after the first $650 are taxed at the child's tax rate.
<P>

You can further enhance the potential tax benefits of the gift by
choosing an investment strategy that emphasizes capital appreciation
over income. While income dividends are taxed up to the highest marginal
tax rate of 39.6 percent, the current maximum tax on capital gains is 28
percent. Growth stocks often pay low or no dividends because earnings
are needed to finance further growth. That being the case, capital growth
funds may be better from a current tax perspective (especially for
children under age 14). Keep in mind, however, that capital growth mutual
funds often make an annual distribution of any realized capital gains 
which would be taxable when distributed.
<P>

The procedures for calculating the tax for children under age 14 can be
very complex, with the amount of tax dependent upon both the type of
income (earned versus unearned) and the amount of deductions offsetting
that income. Additional information may be found in the U.S. Savings Bond Investor Information Guide, which is available from the <A HREF="http://www.ustreas.gov/treasury/bureaus/pubdebt/save.html">Savings Bond page</A> of the U.S. Treasury web site. You may wish to consult with a tax, legal or other advisor
for more information, particularly if these gifts are to be part of a
larger financial plan. Please call Kemper's Shareholder Services
representatives at (800) 621-1048 for answers to administrative
questions.

<B>Q: Does a Kemper Fund gift account qualify for the gift tax
exclusion?</B> <BR>
<B>A:</B> Yes, an UGMA gift qualifies for the $10,000 annual gift tax
exclusion. If your spouse consents and you file IRS Form 709 (this form can be retrieved from the <A HREF="http://www.irs.ustreas.gov/prod/">IRS web site</A>), you and
your spouse may give up to $20,000 per year tax-free to each child.

<IMG SRC="gifs/special_planning_head.gif" ALT="Pre-Retirees Have Special Planning Pressures"><P>

<I>Anyone can leap tall buildings in a single bound.
Dodging speeding bullets is overrated.
But 
who can plan a retirement
when they
have their own job to do,
are worried about getting their kids started out right in life
and are helping their parents age comfortably?</I><P>


<IMG SRC="gifs/special_planning1_subhead.gif" ALT="Now That's A Job For Super You!"><BR>

If anyone can fill the tights of a superhero, it has to be today's 50- to 64-year-olds. If you're in that age group, you know what the pressures are: <P>

<UL>
<LI>Eight out of 10 pre-retirees (those in the 50-plus generation) have adult children, almost one-third of whom live with their parents. Many parents who married "later in life" are paying all or some of their children's college expenses.*<P>

<LI>In part because their parents married and had their children "early" in their lives, half of all pre-retirees have at least one living parent; 22 percent have two living parents. Considering their in-laws, as well, 70 percent of pre-retirees have a parent for whom they have some financial responsibilities.*<P>

<LI>Between 16 and 30 percent of the 50-plus generation are estimated to have set aside nothing toward their retirement due, for the most part, to financial difficulties.**<P>

<LI>Women in this generation often quit full-time employment to spend 18 hours a day or more serving as a home nurse without pay.***<P>
</UL>
<BR>

Well, superhero, we'd like you to walk back into that telephone booth and transform yourself into plain old average Clark or Clarkina Kent - who will be retiring in the next 10 to 15 years. We'd like you to contemplate your retirement and how you might prepare for it. (And if it helps at all, you might want to think of your retirement years as one powerful locomotive barreling toward you.)

<DD>You're looking good, you're active, maybe you're a top performer at work. The fact remains that it's time to start thinking about a new, imminent responsibility - as a retiree. Are you ready? With a life expectancy longer than any generation before you, you had better be. (Haven't you heard - superheroes live forever!)<P>

<DT><IMG SRC="gifs/getready2_subhead.gif" WIDTH=298 HEIGHT=17 ALT="How broad are those shoulders?">
<DD>Of course, you may expect to always be there for your parents, for your children and for your dear friends. But who are you turning to for help? There's no need to make your retirement planning decisions on your own. For a comprehensive overview of the range of investments available and their suitability for your circumstances, call on a financial representative. <P>

<DT><IMG SRC="gifs/getready3_subhead.gif" WIDTH=224 HEIGHT=17 ALT="Will you have enough?">
<DD>For your retirement years, you may need about 70 to 80 percent of the salary you made in your
highest earning years. How much can you count on from Uncle Sam? You can go to
<A  HREF="http://www.ssa.gov/">Social Security Online</A> or call 1-800-772-1213 to request
an Earnings and Benefit Statement (SSA-7004) from the Social Security Administration. The statement
estimates your future benefits.<P>

<DT><IMG SRC="gifs/getready4_subhead.gif" WIDTH=268 HEIGHT=17 ALT="A nice watch and what else?">
<DD>Are you counting on your employer to provide more than just a gold watch at retirement? Depending on your age and years of service, you may qualify for a full, partial or no pension at all from your employer. You'll want to ask your company pension plan administrator for details about your company's vesting, distribution (lump sum or rollover) and payment options. <P>

<DT><IMG SRC="gifs/getready5_subhead.gif" WIDTH=228 HEIGHT=17 ALT="Still weak in the knees?">
<DD>Of course you would be, when you consider the total sum that you may need to finance a 30-year retirement. One suggestion: Focus on the amount of money that you'll need on a monthly basis, and your financial representative may be able to develop an investment plan capable of meeting your monthly needs. <P>

<DT><IMG SRC="gifs/getready6_subhead.gif" WIDTH=213 HEIGHT=17 ALT="Don't just stand there!">
<DD>As important as all your other responsibilities may be to you, now is the time for you to make tracks in planning for the retirement that you deserve. The Social Security Administration and your employer can tell you about how much they'll be contributing - the question is: What more can <I>you</I> do? Leaping into action on your personal saving and investing now can help make a big difference 10 years from now. Get ready to retire!<P>

<IMG SRC="gifs/early_ira_head.gif" ALT="How Early IRA Contributions Can Add Up">
<BR>

<IMG SRC="gifs/early_ira_subhead.gif" ALT="What's the big fuss about April 15?">
<BR>

Have you ever stopped to consider what you're missing out on by
waiting until the last possible minute to make your Individual Retirement Account (IRA) contribution? 
<P>

Making a contribution just in the nick of time has become standard
practice for many taxpayers. It's understandable, perhaps, for taxpayers
who qualify for a tax-deductible contribution - they can use a
last-minute IRA contribution to reduce the amount of income they'll pay
tax on. 
<P>

But, because their annual incomes exceed the current IRS limits,
many taxpayers cannot qualify for a tax-deductible IRA. The benefit of
an IRA to all taxpayers is the ability to build a retirement
account whose earnings can grow free from taxes until the account is
distributed, at which time they may be taxed as ordinary income. 
(Distributions prior to 59 1/2
may be subject to a 10 percent penalty.) 
<P>

The opportunity to build an IRA - through an annual contribution of a
maximum of $2,000 - becomes available every year, starting on January 1
of the tax year. This "window of opportunity" remains open until, in
most years, April 15 of the next year. 
<P>

Are you sneaking through that window on the last possible date? If you
are, you're foregoing a maximum of 15 months of potential earnings that
can compound free from current taxes! We'll show you why it can be to
your advantage to be ready with your IRA contribution when the window
opens rather than when it's closing. Many savvy IRA investors have
already made and/or are making their 1996 tax year contributions now. 
<P>

<IMG SRC="gifs/early_ira2_subhead.gif" ALT="What's so special about April 15?">
<BR>
We can think of at least four other dates when contributing to your IRA
makes more sense.
<P>

The true benefit of the IRA is its ability to compound earnings that are
not taxed until a distribution is made. The sooner you make your
contribution, the sooner your investment can start working on a tax-deferred 
basis for you. To
illustrate, we've selected four dates to show how the earnings of a
hypothetical fixed-income investment could grow, in the tax year alone
and over a period of 30 years ending on April 15. And to give you an
idea of the value of tax-deferred investing, we also show how much the
same hypothetical investment dollars would earn over the same time
period - if their earnings were taxed every year. We assume a 36% income
tax rate in this example.
<P>

To illustrate the powerful effect of tax-deferred income growth, we've
had to assume a specific fixed growth rate - we've used 8 percent,
compounded monthly. This assumed rate is for illustrative purposes only
and is not intended to represent performance of any specific investment,
which will fluctuate. A program of regular investing cannot assume a
profit nor protect against a loss in a declining market. Since this type
of program involves continuous investment regardless of fluctuating share
values, you'll need to consider your financial ability to continue
the program through periods of low price levels. More important
than the absolute numbers, then, is the growth of an investment
initiated early in the tax year versus the growth of an investment
initiated on the last possible date each year.

<IMG SRC="gifs/dontretdist_head.gif" ALT="Don't Touch Your Retirement
Plan Distribution!">
<BR>

So, congratulations are in order. You've just gotten a new job and well
wishes abound. You're feeling on top of the world when you hear from a
representative of your (soon-to-be-former) company's retirement plan:
What are your plans for the sum that's been accumulating in your name?
<P>

Of course, you're going to be tempted. (It's how much?) But this is more
than a left side of the brain/right side of the brain problem
confronting you. From a tax perspective, deciding whether to take your
distribution in cash or whether to roll it over is a struggle between
right and wrong. 
<P>

What should you do with your retirement plan distribution? This is one
of very few topics on which investment advisors are in complete
agreement. 
<P>
<B> Conventional Wisdom </B>
<P>
The "right" answer to the question, "What should I do with my
retirement plan distribution?" is based on a few assumptions:
<UL>
<LI> Because your contribution to your retirement plan is deducted from
your pay even before you see it (matched in some cases by employer
contributions), retirement plans are among the easiest ways to plan for
a comfortable future.
<LI> Time has a value of its own. You can never recover the time you've
already spent building a tax-deferred retirement plan.
<LI> Investments that compound on a tax-deferred basis (without their
current balances being reduced by the need to pay taxes every year) have
higher earning potential.
<LI> By virtue of their tax-deferred status, retirement plans are
endorsed
by the federal government - conversely, the government penalizes most
premature (before the age of 59 1/2) distributions from
retirement
plans.
<LI> Most investors go out of their way to minimize the amount they pay
in
federal income tax.
</UL>
<P>

<B>Your decision</B>
<BR>
You are 30 years old and your plan payout totals $20,000.
<P>

<B>You have three choices:</B>
<P>
<B>1. </B>You can take your distribution in cash.
<P> 

Do that and, assuming you're in the 28 percent tax bracket, you will owe
the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) 28 percent of $20,000 or $5,600 in
current income taxes. Plus, as a general rule, you'll have to pay a 10
percent penalty, or $2,000 more, for taking the distribution before
reaching age 59 1/2.
<P>

You'll have $12,400 left from your plan.
<P>

<B>2. </B>You can take your distribution in cash and move it into an
Individual
Retirement Account (IRA) or you may be able to move the cash into a
qualified retirement plan of your new company within 60 days of
receiving the check.
<P>

Your employer is required by the IRS to withhold 20 percent of your
distribution ($4,000) as a prepayment of your potential tax liability.
You won't owe current income taxes on the remaining amount - $16,000 -
as long as you roll it over within 60 days. 
<P>

Even if you roll over the $16,000 cash distribution within 60 days,
you'll owe current income taxes (28 percent of $4,000 or $1,120) and
applicable early withdrawal penalties (10 percent of $4,000 or $400) on
the $4,000 your employer paid to the IRS. The difference between the
$4,000 prepayment and the $1,520 in income taxes due represents a tax
credit, which the IRS will refund to you (less any additional income
taxes you may owe) after you file your tax return.
<P>

<B>3. </B>You could request your employer to transfer your distribution
directly into an IRA or possibly into a qualified retirement plan of
your new company. Where should your distribution be invested? Your
financial representative can review the possibilities with you.
<P>

Selecting this option would keep all $20,000 of your plan assets working
for you and you'd continue to
defer taxes until you withdraw money from your account. 
<P>

The hypothetical examples in the above graph assume a 28 percent income
tax bracket and an 8 percent return, compounded monthly. This assumed
rate of return is for illustrative purposes only and is not intended to
represent performance of any specific investment, which may fluctuate.
IRA and qualified retirement plan assets will be subject to current
income taxes at the time of withdrawal, under current tax law.
Calculations assume a 28 percent annual income tax liability on the
amount invested in a taxable investment.

In advertisements and newspaper articles and from your financial
representative directly, you'll be hearing a lot about retirement
planning from Kemper Funds in 1996. Retirement planning is a process
that can never be started too soon and should continue throughout one's
retirement years. 
<P>

<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="gifs/ncoalogo.gif">
As a means of demonstrating our commitment to retirees and enhancing our
understanding of older adults, Kemper has become a corporate member of

<IMG SRC="gifs/price_retdream_head.gif" ALT="The Price Of Your
Retirement Dream">
<BR>

It's easy for us to put a price tag on what your retirement dream costs
today. Much more difficult is your job - you need to project what it
will take to realize that dream tomorrow, six months or 30 years from
now. 
<P>

What do you want to do in your retirement and what financial resources
do you need to accomplish those dreams? 
<P>

These are the two questions that both retirees and those not yet retired
must ask and answer as they plan for an unknown future. 
<P>

Whether we like it or not, money is a means to an end, and that's
particularly true when it comes to retirement. Indeed, your financial
state can dictate your retirement age. 
<P>

Today, according to research by Georgetown University, 63 is the median
retirement age for both men and women. Many of those who continue to
work beyond age 63 are those who feel their financial resources are
insufficient. 
<P>

Americans' retirement income comes from four basic sources - Social
Security, asset income, pensions and earnings. The percentage
contributed by each has been shifting over the years, with the decline
in Social Security income being the most notable change.  
<P>

How much total income is needed to finance the retirement you've dreamed
about? You must consider the income and growth potential of your assets
against your retirement objectives. Be forewarned: This will be an
analysis chocked with imponderables - prevailing inflation rates, your
age at retirement, how long you live after you retire, the size of your
Social Security and employee benefits, your post-retirement obligations
and your plans. 
<P>

Establishing and following through on an investment plan that can take
you to retirement and beyond can be a daunting task. To keep yourself
motivated, we suggest that you visualize your dream and work toward it.
Every individual has his or her own vision of retirement, of course.
Generally, though, as a retiree you ought to be able to... 
<P>

<IMG SRC="gifs/price_retdream1_subhead.gif" ALT="Go Where You Want To
Go...">
<BR>
After years of meeting a work schedule, you're free to go whenever and
wherever you please. 
<P>

Your dream may be to travel to see new sights and or stroll down
different streets. For a permanent change of scenery or climate, you may
want to relocate. 
<P>

Then again, you may not want to go anywhere. In a 1992 American
Association of Retired Persons survey, more than eight out of 10 people
aged 55 and older said they'd like to stay in their current homes. If
that's your decision, your retirement income should provide for you to
cover your maintenance expenses. Let someone else mow the lawn or shovel
the snow. You may want to invest in some modifications that enable you
to stay in your home as long as you want. 
<P>

<IMG SRC="gifs/price_retdream2_subhead.gif" ALT="Do What You Want To Do...">
<BR> 
Kemper estimates that the typical retiree needs at least 75 percent of
his or her pre-retirement income to live comfortably. Some expenses -
such as those related to transportation or clothes for work - decline at
retirement. But health care and certain other expenses tend to rise.  
<P>

It's been said that in retirement, time no longer equals money. That can
be good and bad. The "spending" of time can be directed on what may not
have been possible to do before - line dancing at a country western
club, whiling away hours in a fine art gallery or serving a church. 
<P>

Yet many retirees become nervous at the thought that instead of devoting
the majority of their time to an income-generating occupation, they are
doing nothing but consuming. Retirees are acutely aware that everything
has a price, and that their spending depletes the assets they worked
years to build.  
<P>

<IMG SRC="gifs/price_retdream3_subhead.gif" ALT="Worry Less.">
<BR> 

To enjoy the freedom that you have at retirement, your financial assets
must continue to work for you after you've stopped working.  
<P>

The biggest threat to your doing what you want to do and going where you
want to go - and the source of many retirees' financial problems - is
the effect of inflation on the financial resources you accumulate by
retirement age. Inflation raises the specter that what you accumulate
may not be sufficient over the long term. 
<P>

At least one retiree expense is especially inflationary. At a time when
the annual inflation rate has been averaging 3.5 percent, prescriptions
and medical care in general has increased by 15 percent to 20 percent
per year, according to the <I>Older Americans Almanac.</I> 
<P>

Both retirees and people not yet retired need to take proactive steps to
account for inflation. Your success in planning a worry-free retirement,
in fact, can turn on an investment program that anticipates inflation's
effect on your future purchasing power and standard of living. Beating
inflation is your best bet for realizing your retirement dream.

<IMG SRC="gifs/sav_acct_chart.gif">

<P>

As an economist, I am alarmed by the results of the recent Kemper-Roper
Retirement Monitor, a survey conducted to report on American attitudes
and expectations regarding retirement. Specifically, the finding that a
regular savings account was the most popular individual investment
(after the company-sponsored 401(k)) for retirement - across all age
groups - is very sad. 
<P>

When you consider the language that Americans use when talking about
retirement, this should not be surprising. When we talk about planning,
for example, we talk about "saving" for retirement. We don't often hear
about investing for retirement. It's a "nest egg" that we try to build,
not an income-generating machine. 
<P>

Why is this sad? I wonder how many people who are "saving" for
retirement today are considering the risk they're taking that their
savings account will tragically fail to provide for the length and
quality of the retirement they can expect - not to mention expensive
health care. While the principal and interest of a savings account is
generally insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the
risk is that the retiree will outlive his or her income from it. 
<P>

These survey results demonstrate that Americans clearly want safety for
their retirement funds. We are not about to overlook the potential for
default, which was a lesson learned well from the 1930s Depression era.
Yet there is another lesson that history can teach us - and it is that
inflation has the potential to erode the real value of our retirement
funds. In the 1970s, returns on savings accounts failed to keep up with
inflation. In the 1980s, savings accounts failed to keep up with
economic growth. It is precisely because rates paid on savings accounts
are not pegged to economic growth or inflation that they fail to keep up
with either. 
<P>

By contrast, other investments have historically provided returns above
the rate of inflation. 
<P>

For appropriate investment guidelines today, we need to look forward not
backward. In the past, Social Security benefits made up the shortfall
between desired income needs and the returns provided by regular savings
accounts. That won't continue, as reduced real benefit levels and higher
taxes are the future for Social Security. 
<P>

Perceptions of risk and required return drive retirement planning. The
popularity of savings accounts as a retirement vehicle suggests that
Americans have a high aversion to risk for their retirement funds but a
very low estimated need for a return. In a world of 3 percent or more
inflation and federal budget cutbacks on Social Security and Medicare,
Americans should recognize that reliance on regular savings accounts is
not a strategy without a risk of its own.

<FONT SIZE=-1>#Portfolios are subject to change.<BR>
## These figures are adjusted for maximum sales charge (Class A) or the
contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC) in effect at the end of the
specified period (Class B). The maximum initial sales charge (Class A)
is 3.50% for Kemper Cash Reserves Fund. The CDSC schedule for Class B shares for years 1 to 6 is 4%, 3%, 3%, 2%, 2% and 1%. Adjustment for a full annual
period is at CDSC for the next annual level. Thus, 1-year returns are
adjusted for 3% CDSC. For C shares, performance is adjusted for the 1% 
CDSC for shares redeemed within one year. Sales charges are reduced or eliminated under
certain conditions as described in the funds' prospectuses.
</FONT SIZE=-1>
<P>

For more complete information on any Kemper Fund, including management
fees and expenses, please request a free prospectus from your
financial representative, Kemper Shareholder Services (1-800-621-1048), 
<A HREF="../prospectus_email.html">
e-mail us your request</A> for a prospectus through the mail or 
<A HREF="../prospectus_download.html">
download a prospectus.</A>
<P>

Read the prospectus carefully before you invest or send money. Remember
that there is no assurance that the objective of any mutual fund will
be achieved and mutual fund returns and net asset value fluctuate.
Shares are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or
less than their original cost. Money market funds seek to maintain a
net asset value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that
they will. Mutual fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. 
government. 
<P>

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<B>Performance And Yield Notes</B>
<BR>
Returns are historical and do not represent future performance. Returns
and net asset values fluctuate. Shares
are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or less
than the original cost. Kemper Money Funds seek to maintain a net asset
value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that they will.
Fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. government.
<P>

Average annual total return and total return measure net investment
income and capital gain or loss from portfolio investments, assuming reinvestment
of dividends and, for average annual total return only, adjustments for the maximum
sales charge or the contingent deferred sales charge in effect at the end of the periods,
as applicable.  Average annual
total return reflects annualized change while total return reflects
aggregate change. During the periods noted, securities prices
fluctuated. For each money market fund, the current annualized yield is
the seven day annualized net investment income per share as of the
indicated date. Gains or losses are not included. Effective yield
reflects compounding of income.
<P>

<B>Special Risks</B>
<BR>
Investment by certain portfolios in lower rated and non-rated securities
presents a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher
rated securities (principally Kemper Diversified Income Fund and Kemper
High Yield Fund). For portfolios that invest internationally
(principally Kemper International Fund, Kemper Global Income Fund, Kemper
Europe Fund, Kemper Diversified Income Fund, Kemper Asian Growth Fund
and Kemper Worldwide 2004 Fund), there
are special risk considerations, including foreign exchange rates,
foreign government regulations and differing degrees of liquidity that
may adversely affect portfolio securities, all of which are more fully
discussed in the funds' prospectuses. 
Investment in smaller companies (Kemper Small Capitalization Equity Fund
and Kemper-Dreman Small Cap Value Fund) presents greater risk of loss
than investment in large companies. Concentration in certain market
sectors (Kemper-Dreman High Return Fund) presents special risk
considerations.
<P>

Performance of funds may be compared to the performance of various
unmanaged indices including, but not limited to: the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index and the Dow
Jones Industrial Average, which are generally representative of the U.S.
stock market; the Wilshire Large Company Growth Index, which is
generally representative of the market for stocks of larger growth
companies (selected on the basis of sales growth, return on equity and
dividend payout); the Lehman Brothers Government/Corporate Bond index,
which is generally representative of intermediate and long-term
government and investment grade corporate debt securities; the Morgan
Stanley Capital International EAFE, which is generally representative of
international markets; the FT/S&amp;P - Actuaries World Index - Europe, which 
is generally representative of the equity securities of European companies; the Consumer Price Index, generally
representative of the level of inflation; the Salomon Brothers World
Government Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index on a U.S. dollar total return basis with all dividends reinvested and is comprised of government bonds from 14 countries; the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index generally representative of intermediate-term government 
bonds, investment grade corporate debt securities and mortgage-backed
securities; the Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index, which includes
approximately 15,000 bonds; the Russell 1000 Growth Index, which is an 
unmanaged index comprised of common stocks of larger U.S. companies with 
greater than average growth orientation and represents the universe of
stocks from which "earnings/growth" money managers typically select; and the
Russell 2000 index, which is an unmanaged capitalization weighted price only 
index which is comprised of 2000 of the smallest stocks in the Russell
3000 index. The performance of funds may also be compared to the combined performance of several indices.
<P>

Returns for Kemper Asian Growth Fund, Kemper Value+Growth Fund, Kemper-Dreman Funds and Kemper Europe Fund include the effect of a temporary waiver of
management fees and/or an absorption of certain operating expenses by Zurich 
Kemper Investments, Inc., as investment advisor, for periods
specified in the prospectus, which improved results. The absorption and
waiver for certain Kemper State Tax-Free Income Funds has been reinstated. Income from
tax-exempt funds may be subject to state and local taxes except as
otherwise provided in the prospectus, and a portion of income may be
subject to the alternative minimum tax for certain investors.

David D. Hale is the global economic strategist for Zurich Group and Zurich Kemper Investments, Inc. In this position, he advises the group's domestic and global fund management operations on the economic outlook and a wide range of public policy issues.
<P>

Mr. Hale, who joined Kemper in 1977, holds a B.Sc. degree in international economic affairs from the Georgetown University School of Foreign Service and a M.Sc. degree in economics from the London School of Economics.

Mr. Hale is a member of the National Association of Business Economists and the New York Society of Security Analysts. He writes on a broad range of economic subjects and his articles have appeared in the Wall Street Journal, The Far Eastern Economic Review, The Financial Times of London, The New York Times, The Nihon Kezai Shimbun, The Financial Analyst Journal, The Harvard Business Review, Foreign Policy and other publications. In 1978, he was appointed a member of the Financial Accounting Standards Board TaskForce on the Conceptual Framework (for accounting standards) because of articles he wrote on inflation accounting. He has frequently testified before Congressional committees on domestic and international economic policy issues and done briefings for senior officials in the executive branch, including President Bush. Since 1990, he also has been a consultant to the U.S. Department of Defense on how changes in the global economy are affecting U.S. security relationships.

This award is conferred annually by the society upon a business economist who has made an outstanding contribution to the field. Other recipients have included Paul Volcker, Geoffrey Moore, Lawrence Klein, Alan Greenspan, and Otto Eckstein.
<P>

In addition to his responsibilities at Kemper, Mr. Hale is a member of the Financial Instruments Steering Committee of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the Academic Advisory Board of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago and a variety of government and private sector economic policy research groups in Washington, Tokyo, and Bonn.

Economic Advisors (1991-92).

<P>
The President has confirmed that the U.S. Treasury will begin
to issue inflation adjusted bonds in January of 1997.  The introduction
of the index linked bond represents a potentially important development
both for the future structure of the public debt as well as the
yield benchmarks which will be used to measure investment performance
in the fund management industry.  Investors have long used government
securities as a proxy for risk free returns in the financial markets.
 The introduction of the index linked bonds will now offer a proxy
for measuring inflation adjusted risk free return.
<P>
The U.S. will be the seventh OECD country to introduce index linked
government debt.  It already exists in Britain, Sweden, Canada,
Australia, New Zealand and Iceland.  Some Latin American nations
also have offered inflation adjusted securities in the past but
they were designed to help their populations cope with hyper-inflation,
not moderate G-7 style inflation.  The British government introduced
the first G-7 index linked bonds in August 1981 and the initial
security offered a real yield of only 2.0% plus a tax free principal
adjustment for inflation.  At first, the securities were offered
only to pension funds but the rules were later modified to permit
purchases by individuals.
<P>
When the UK government introduced its first index linked bond,
many institutional investors responded positively because of their
disastrous experience with inflation during the 1970's.  In the
mid-1970's, conventional British government bonds had lost over
half of their value in nominal terms because Britain's inflation
rate had shot up to 30%.   In 1981, investors also had more modest
expectations of potential returns from securities than exist today.
 Between 1750 and 1950, the average yield on UK government securities
had been about 3.0% with an all time low of 2.21% in 1897.  The
British government's credit standing was so high that it was even
able to finance the First World War by selling bonds with a coupon
yield of 5.0%.   While commodity prices had fluctuated in a wide
range because of wars and changes in the global economy, the overall
British price level had been remarkably stable for nearly two
hundred years.  As a result, many pension funds perceived that
a government security which offered  a guaranteed real return
of 2.0% was an attractive asset.  High income individuals also
were attracted to the prospect of a bond principal inflation adjustment
which was free of income tax.  As a result of this investor support,
the UK government was able to sell over 6 billion pounds of index
linked debt during the first two years after their introduction
compared to a conventional debt stock of 150 billion pounds.
<P>
Between 1981 and 1995, the UK government's index linked securities
produced a cumulative nominal return of 154% and a cumulative
real yield of 40%.  But as the UK economy entered a period of
sustained disinflation after 1980, the return on index linked
securities significantly underperformed other asset classes, such
as equities and conventional government bonds.  Between 1981 and
1995, the UK stock market rose 5.7 times in nominal terms and
by nearly 3 times in real terms.  The price of conventional government
bonds rose by 72% while the real yield on long-term government
securities averaged 3.7%.  The real yield on Treasury bills also
averaged about 5.3% during the period 1981-1995 compared to 2.9%
on the index linked security.  <I>But while the index linked security
did not out perform conventional financial assets, it did produce
a better return than other traditional inflation hedges such as
gold and property.</I>  The British property market boomed during
the mid-1980's because of easy monetary policy but it slumped
so sharply during the early 1990's that index linked securities have out performed 
property for the period since they were introduced.  The nominal
yield on British property has averaged just under 9.0% since 1981
compared to an average nominal yield of 10% on the index linked
bonds.  The gold price peaked at $800 per ounce in 1980 and currently
sells for about $380 per ounce.
<P>
As a result of Britain's greatly improved inflation performance
under Mrs. Thatcher, the market for index linked securities never
developed  the breadth and liquidity of other asset markets. 
But the British government has been attempting to improve the market's liquidity
by doing about 15% of its recent funding in the index linked securities.
 As a result, the stock of index linked debt has expanded to 40
billion pounds compared to a net government debt stock of 260
billion pounds.
<P>
The introduction of index linked debt has produced major interest
cost savings for the British government.  The nominal yield on
index linked debt has averaged about 100-200 basis points below
the yields on other government securities.  The only cost to the
government has been the lost tax receipts from the inflation adjustment
for the depreciating real value of  bond principal.  But the savings
from reduced interest payments have been immediate while the tax
losses from indexation will be felt over the long term.  Before
the index linked bond  was introduced, the UK government had collected
tax on all interest income but it had exempted bonds from capital
gains taxation if they were held for longer than one year.

<B>August 26, 1996</B>
<P>

Several Wall Street newsletters are now suggesting that a victory for the Dole-Kemp ticket in the presidential election would boost equity prices by lowering capital gains taxes while increasing long-term bond yields because of investor concerns about a return to large federal budget deficits. 
<P>
While it is natural for investors to be concerned about the budgetary affects of Republican promises to reduce taxes, the history of the past ten years should have demonstrated that it is the nation's savings and investment balance, not just budget deficits, which determine interest rates.  As a result the impact of the  Dole economic program on bond yields will depend upon how it influences the country's private savings behavior and demand for capital, not just the federal government's deficit.  Several factors suggest that the Dole program will have a less damaging impact on either the federal deficit or interest rates than many Wall Street pundits now fear.
<P>
First, under current law, no administration can enact a tax cut unless there are offsetting spending cuts.  This law was enacted in order to force the Congress to adhere to long-term targets for deficit reduction and it is doubtful that a president as cautious about fiscal policy as Mr. Dole would repeal it.  Indeed, the threat of a bond market collapse would probably constrain Congress from repealing the law even if the Dole-Kemp administration decided to revert to high deficit fiscal policy. As the ratio of federal debt to GDP is now about 55% compared to 28% when Ronald Reagan became president, the markets will be far less tolerant of large scale fiscal stimulus than they were during the early 1980's
<P>
Secondly, the Dole administration has a broad based economic growth agenda of which personal tax cuts are only one part.  The Dole program is also committed to reducing the cost of government regulation and the legal system on U.S. business, slashing capital gains taxes and slowing the growth of Federal spending.  Regulatory cost push has played such a major role in driving up business costs during the past three decades that there is a stronger statistical relationship between the number of pages in the federal register and interest rates than between federal deficits and interest rates.  The register peaked at nearly 90,000 pages during the high inflation era of the late 1970's and fell steadily to a trough of 49,000 during the late 1980's.  The Clinton administration has pushed it back to 70,000, so if a Dole White House could reduce it back to Reagan era levels there would be potential benefits for both inflation and interest rates.
<P>
If the Dole program encourages corporations to invest more aggressively, interest rates could rise because of strong demand for capital in the private sector, not increased government borrowing.  But, as the Dole program has far more modest tax incentives for investment than the Reagan program of 1981, it will probably only have a modest impact on private capital demands and interest rates.  The Reagan program directly subsidized investment through large increases in depreciation allowances whereas the Dole program is focused on capital gains relief and regulatory reform.
<P>
The overall scope of  the Dole fiscal program is also very modest compared to the tax changes which occurred during the Reagan years.  The Dole program would reduce the top marginal tax rate to 34% whereas during the Reagan years it declined to 28%.  If Congress enacted every tax change proposed by the Dole-Kemp platform without cutting spending, the net fiscal stimulus to the economy would be only $58 billion during 1998 compared to a nominal GDP of $8 trillion.  It is also quite likely that the capital gains tax cut would produce such a huge revenue windfall that the federal deficit would shrink during the twelve to twenty four months after the
 enactment of the Dole tax program.  As a result of the equity bull market since 1991, the ratio of stock market capitalization to GDP in the U.S. is now 95% compared to a previous all time peak of 82% in 1929 and a sixty year moving average of 48%.  If the household sector could realize capital gains with a tax rate of only 14%, there would be a realignment of portfolios on a scale so large that the Treasury would experience a massive revenue windfall.
<P>
Thirdly, the presidential campaign cannot be viewed in isolation from the congressional election campaign.  Under the influence of consultant Richard Morris, the President recast himself as a conservative on many social and economic issues during the first half of 1996 but the Democratic Party in the Congress remains far to the left of the President.  During most of the 20th Century, the Congressional Democratic Party was well balanced between membership from the rural south and the urban northeast and middle west.  During the 1990's, though, the Democratic Party has lost most of its congressional membership in the south and became heavily dependent upon the urban centers of the Northeast, the middle west, and California.  In the House, for example, the Republicans now have 78 of the 125 seats in the old southern confederacy  compared to only 6 in 1960.  As a result of  the pending retirement of many long-term Democratic incumbents, the Republican share of southern seats could easily rise to 90-100 this autumn even if the party loses seats elsewhere in the country.  If the Democratic Party regains control of the House with only 20-30 southern seats, many of their most influential committee chairmen will be far to the left not just of current Republican chairmen but also of previous Democratic chairmen.  The contrast between a house speaker Richard Gephardt and the old Democratic house speaker, Tom Foley, would also be very striking.  After flirting with so-called "new Democrat" themes in the mid-1980's, Rep. Gephardt has devoted most of the past decade to promoting protectionist trade policies and new forms of federal intervention in the economy.  President Clinton  has so far resisted most of the congressional Democrats' economic proposals,  but as a result of his apparent flexibility on many issues, the financial markets are uncertain about how he would manage a more left wing Democratic Congress if he is reelected to a second term.  The great fear haunting the U.S. bond market today is not a Dole-Kemp victory in the Presidential election and the enactment of a modest Republican tax cut program.  It is what would happen to government spending, the cost of federal regulation, and trade policy in the event that the Democrats made a sweep of both the White House and the Congress.  Such a sweep would probably encourage an immediate wave of selling by foreign investors in the U.S. bond market and a slump in the stock markets of emerging market economies sensitive to U.S. trade policy.

<P>
<b>An address given to the National Conference of State Legislatures, St. Louis, July 28, 1996</b>
<p>


America's system of federalism will face unique challenges during the
late 1990's and early years of the 21st century.
<p>
The Congress wants to devolve more responsibilities to the states at the same
time that the costs of funding traditional services, such as Medicare and
education, are projected to rise sharply.  As a result of the long expansion
which the U.S. economy has enjoyed since 1991, most states are currently in
good fiscal shape but the late 1990's could produce great financial stresses
for them if their increased responsibilities coincide with a recession.
Indeed, it would not be an exaggeration to suggest that devolution against a
background of recession could set the stage for other radical policy changes,
such as the privatization of many state owned enterprises and services.<p>
<p>
The fiscal challenge which will confront American states during the late 1990's
has several dimensions.<p>
<p>
First, the Congress wants to reduce the aid which it provides to American
states as well as to alter the formulas through which it is distributed.  In
the budget debate, six months ago, the Congress wanted to reduce federal
assistance to the states by 26%.  It is doubtful that future cuts will be that
large but it is not difficult to imagine cuts of 15-20% if Congress continues
to push for a balanced federal budget by the year 2000.   The pressure to
reduce federal laid to the states does not just reflect the political ideology
of the newly ascendant Republican Party.  It is also a by-product of
demographic factors.  The population of the U.S. will age steadily during the
next few decades and cause entitlement spending for the retired to rise
sharply.  The federal government share of GDP will also increase significantly
unless other forms of spending are curtailed.  The problem of demography in the
U.S. is much less serious than in other industrial countries because of its
high level of immigration and higher birthrate but aging is still a general
problem for all the industrial nations.  In fact, two thirds of all the people
who have ever lived to the age of 65 in the long history of mankind are alive
today.  Such simple facts reveal more about the forces driving public spending
in the modern world than all the political science journals which debate the
philosophical implications of public spending choices.<p>
<p>
Secondly, the Congress wants to shift from open ended matching grant assistance
to the states to block grants.  Under the new system, the states would receive
a fixed sum of money and be given more flexibility in how they chose to spend
it.  But in contrast to the current system, their aid would not increase
automatically in response to some economic shock, such as a recession.  The new
system of financing would represent a sharp break with the pattern of financing
which has prevailed during most of the modern era under both Democratic and
Republican administrations.  During the Bush administration, for example,
federal aid to the states rose from $124 billion to $194 billion.  Much of the
increase resulted from the impact of the 1990-1991 recession on social service
programs. But part of it also resulted from the states shifting Medicaid costs
to the federal government as well as increases in matching grants from other
federally mandated programs.  As a result of the growth of federal spending
during the Bush years, aid to the states is currently equal to about 3.2% of
GDP compared to a post war peak of 3.6% of GDP in 1973, 1.9% in 1965, and 0.9%
in 1940.<p>
<p>
Thirdly, despite the sharp drop in the U.S. inflation rate, the federal budget
is projecting that Medicaid spending will continue to rise at a 8% annual rate.
In the federal budget,  Medicaid expenditures will grow from $168 billion to
$267 billion.  As the states account for about 43% of Medicaid spending, their
outlays will also expand.  Some states are trying to control costs by forcing
their recipients to use HMO's, but in many states there is so much public
hostility to HMO's that legislatures are enacting laws which require them to be
less severe in rationing their services.<p>
<p>
Fourthly, the population of school age children is once again expanding.  It is
projected to grow from 47 million in 1991 to 56 million in 2004, surpassing the
old 1971 peak of 51 million.  The GAO says that the U.S. needs to spend $112
billion on new school construction compared to recent outlays of $3 billion per
annum.<p>
<p>
Meanwhile, the U.S. electorate remains hostile to the idea of tax increases.
Almost none were enacted by state legislatures during the past two years while
the Congress itself flirted with the idea of reducing federal gasoline taxes a
few months ago.<p>
<p>
There is also growing public opposition to the spread of gambling.  Lotteries
will probably continue to generate revenue equal to about 2.5% of state tax
receipts, but there will be far more restrictions on the introduction of new
casinos.  It appears that only three states will permit the establishment of
significant casino industries.  They are Nevada, New Jersey and Mississippi.
<p>
<p>
The good news is that state governments are in better fiscal shape to confront
these challenges then at any other time during the past decade.<p>
<p>
The economy has enjoyed five years of steady growth, so the state and local
government sector enjoys a healthy budget surplus.  There also have been far
fewer  regional disparities in the national economy's performance during the
current expansion than was the case during the 1970's and 1980's.<p>
<p>
In the 1970's, the U.S. economy's growth leaders were states producing oil and
other commodities enjoying sharply higher prices.  In the 1980's, there were
booms on both coasts while the middle west suffered from the overvalued dollar
and the western states were crippled by collapsing commodity prices and bankin
crisis.  In the early 1990's, new England and California experienced severe
slumps but both have recovered during recent years while other regions have
continued to enjoy steady growth.<p>
<p>
As a result of the length and breadth of the national expansion, the state and
local government sector currently enjoys a budget surplus of $40 billion
excluding pension funds compared to $11 billion five years ago.  The surplus as
a share of GDP is only about 0.6% or well below the 1.2% peak of the 1980's
business cycle but it is a respectable number for an expansion which has been
characterized by such low inflation.<p>
<p>
The U.S. economy's current cyclical environment is exceptionally benign for the
sixth year of a business cycle.  The unemployment rate has dropped to 5.3% but
inflation is still only about 3.0% excluding food and fuel.    The growth rate
of real output is likely to average about 2.6% this year compared to 2.0% last
year and 3.5% during 1994.<p>
<p>
The economy's outstanding inflation performance has surprised many analysts and
explains why the business cycle has been so prolonged.  The Federal Reserve has
had no incentive to surpress the expansion in order to promote price
stability.<p>
<p>
There are several factors which explain why the U.S. economy has been able to
enjoy such a benign combination of low unemployment and low inflation.<p>
First, the current business cycle has enjoyed some very positive supply side
characteristics.  There has been such robust business investment that during
the past two years the growth rate of manufacturing capacity has accelerated to
nearly 4.5% from 2.0% during the early 1990's.<p>
<p>
Secondly, U.S. firms have been very aggressive in controlling costs and
boosting productivity.  The restructuring has created social concerns about
employment stability, especially in large companies, but the growth of profits
has helped to set the stage for an extraordinary boom in job creation.  Total
employment has expanded by over 10 million spare jobs since 1992 whereas during
the period 1988-1992 it grew by only about 3.5 million jobs.<p>
<p>
Thirdly, American firms have been on the cutting edge of developing and
introducing new technology. In the U.S., the ratio of computers to workers is
now at 57 per 100 in the corporate sector compared to 20 in Western Europe, 16
in Japan, and 4 in southeast Asia. There are new technology oriented companies
on the stock market with capitalizations of $2-3 billion which did not exist
three years ago.  The Internet firm, Netscape, now has a market capitalization
of $3.9 billion compared to zero two years ago.  The capitalization of
Microsoft has expanded from $24 billion in 1992 to $75 billion recently.  IBM's
market capitalization has even rebounded to $55.5 from $28.5 billion in late
1992 but is still far below its peak of over $100 billion in the late 1980's.<p>
<p>
Fourthly, the Federal Reserve has done an excellent job of managing the
business cycle.  There was an upsurge of output growth during 1994 which
strained available inventories and caused commodity prices to rise sharply.
This change in the price environment could have set the stage for an
acceleration in the inflation rate but the Fed moved quickly to reduce the
economy's growth rate to the 2.0-2.5% range from 3.5-4.0% in order to restrain
inflationary pressures  As a result, commodity prices corrected and the Fed was
able to ease monetary policy during early 1995.  The Fed will face new
challenges in restraining inflation later this year but it enjoys so much
credibility that the price of restraining inflation will be much less severe
than during the business cycles of the 1970's and early 1980's.<p>

<P>
The U.S. Treasury has announced that it will soon introduce a
new government security which will be indexed for inflation. 
The introduction of the index linked bond represents a potentially
important development both for the future structure of the public
debt as well as the yield benchmarks which will be used to measure
investment performance in the fund management industry.  Investors
have long used government securities as a proxy for risk free
returns in the financial markets.  The introduction of the index
linked bonds will now offer a proxy for measuring inflation adjusted
risk free return.
<P>
The U.S. will be the sixth OECD country to introduce index linked
government debt.  It already exists in Britain, Sweden, Canada,
Australia and New Zealand.  The British government introduced
the first index linked bonds in August 1981 and the initial security
offered a real yield of only 2.0% plus a tax free principal adjustment
for inflation.  At first, the securities were offered only to
pension funds but the rules were later modified to permit purchases
by individuals.
<P>
When the UK government introduced its first index linked bond,
many institutional investors responded positively because of their
disastrous experience with inflation during the 1970's.  In the
mid-1970's, conventional British government bonds had lost over
half of their value in nominal terms because Britain's inflation
rate had shot up to 30%.   In 1981, investors also had more modest
expectations of potential returns from securities than exist today.
 Between 1750 and 1950, the average yield on UK government securities
had been about 3.0% with an all time low of 2.21% in 1897.  The
British government's credit standing was so high that it was even
able to finance the First World War by selling bonds with a coupon
yield of 5.0%.   While commodity prices had fluctuated in a wide
range because of wars and changes in the global economy, the overall
British price level had been remarkably stable for nearly two
hundred years.  As a result, many pension funds perceived that
a government security which offered  a guaranteed real return
of 2.0% was an attractive asset.  High income individuals also
were attracted to the prospect of a bond principal inflation adjustment
which was free of income tax.  As a result of this investor support,
the UK government was able to sell over 6 billion pounds of index
linked debt during the first two years after their introduction
compared to a conventional debt stock of 150 billion pounds.
<P>
Between 1981 and 1995, the UK government's index linked securities
produced a cumulative nominal return of 154% and a cumulative
real yield of 40%.  But as the UK economy entered a period of
sustained disinflation after 1980, the return on index linked
securities significantly underperformed other asset classes, such
as equities and conventional government bonds.  Between 1981 and
1995, the UK stock market rose 5.7 times in nominal terms and
by nearly 3 times in real terms.  The price of conventional government
bonds rose by 72% while the real yield on long-term government
securities averaged 3.7%.  The real yield on Treasury bills also
averaged about 5.3% during the period 1981-1995 compared to 2.9%
on the index linked security.  <I>But while the index linked security
did not out perform conventional financial assets, it did produce
a better return than other traditional inflation hedges such as
gold and property.</I>  The British property market boomed during
the mid-1980's because of easy monetary policy but it slumped
so sharply during the early 1990's that index linked securities have out performed 
property for the period since they were introduced.  The nominal
yield on British property has averaged just under 9.0% since 1981
compared to an average nominal yield of 10% on the index linked
bonds.  The gold price peaked at $800 per ounce in 1980 and currently
sells for about $395 per ounce.
<P>
As a result of Britain's greatly improved inflation performance
under Mrs. Thatcher, the market for index linked securities never
developed  the breadth and liquidity of other asset markets. 
But the British government has been attempting to improve the market's liquidity
by doing about 15% of its recent funding in the index linked securities.
 As a result, the stock of index linked debt has expanded to 40
billion pounds compared to a net government debt stock of 260
billion pounds.
<P>
The introduction of index linked debt has produced major interest
cost savings for the British government.  The nominal yield on
index linked debt has averaged about 100-200 basis points below
the yields on other government securities.  The only cost to the
government has been the lost tax receipts from the inflation adjustment
for the depreciating real value of  bond principal.  But the savings
from reduced interest payments have been immediate while the tax
losses from indexation will be felt over the long term.  Before
the index linked bond  was introduced, the UK government had collected
tax on all interest income but it had exempted bonds from capital
gains taxation if they were held for longer than one year.
<P>
Canada, Australia, and New Zealand followed Britain's lead by
introducing index linked debt during the 1980's and early 1990's,
but their stock of index linked debt is much smaller than Britain's
both in absolute terms and as a share of their national debt.
 Canada has about $5.8 billion ($4.4 U.S.) of index linked debt,
Australia has about $6 billion ($4.8 U.S.) and New Zealand has
only about $200 million ($130 U.S.).  New Zealand has recently
increased its use of index linked debt and investor interest has
been strong because of the high yields (5.8%) and the fact that
New Zealand will soon have an election under a new system of proportional
representation which could weaken political support for non-inflationary
economic policies.  Canada issued its first index linked bonds
during 1991 when real interest rates on conventional bonds were
at high levels and then reduced the supply as interest rates fell.
 But the Canadian govenment recently began issuing new index linked
bonds and plans to have quarterly auctions at a rate of $300-500
million.  Sweden introduced index linked bonds only last year
but it is promoting them so aggressively that they could be worth
about 10% of Sweden's $100 billion of public debt by early 1997.
 The bonds have so far suffered from illiquidity because pension
funds have been hoarding them, but the coming expansion of supply
should enhance trading.  They offer a real yield of over 5.5%
as well as an inflation adjustment but, in contrast to Britain
and other commonwealth countries, there is no tax exemption for
the inflation indexation component of the return.
<P>
The U.S. Treasury will soon hold hearings around the country to
obtain investor reactions to its proposals for an inflation adjusted
bond.  At present,  the only details which the Treasury has provided
about the new instrument is that it will be available in maturities
of ten or thirty years and that it will be in denominations of
$1,000 per bond.  It has not yet decided which price index to
use for adjusting the bonds for inflation but is considering a
variety of alternatives, including the Consumer Price Index, the
GDP deflator, the CPI excluding food and energy and the Employment
Cost Index.

The recent growth of the American mutual fund industry has been so dramatic that it is giving the U.S. a very different financial structure than other industrial countries.  In the modern era, countries have typically organized their financial system around either a universal banking model encompassing many financial services or a hybrid structure which separates commercial and investment banking.  The U.S. is in the midst of creating a whole new financial system, in which the mutual fund sector is increasingly displacing commercial banks as the major repositories of household wealth as well as suppliers of capital to many small and medium sized companies.

<P>

The U.S. mutual fund industry began during the 1920's and grew steadily during the decades after World War Two but its total assets remained very modest compared to the banking system until recently.  In 1960, equity funds had assets of $11.9 billion and bond funds had assets of $5.1 billion but there were not yet any money market funds.  The bull market of the 1960's increased the industry's equity assets to $38.5 billion while bond funds grew to $9.1 billion.  There was little growth of equity assets during the 1970's because of the severe bear market which resulted from high inflation during the middle years of the decade but the introduction of money market funds produced $76.4 billion of new assets for the industry during the period 1975-1980.  Money market funds exploded after 1978 because the Federal Reserve sharply increased money market yields to combat inflation while banks were not permitted to offer market interest rates on their deposits until the early 1980's.  As a result, money funds accounted for almost 75% of the mutual fund industry's total assets by 1982.

<P>

The U.S. mutual fund industry now has $1.3 trillion of equity oriented funds, $811 billion of long-term bond funds, and $753 billion of money market funds.  Its collective assets of nearly $3 trillion now greatly exceed the $2.3 trillion of assets in the national banking system but are still smaller than the $4.2 trillion of assets in all of America's 10,000 insured commercial banks.     The ownership of mutual funds is not as universal as the ownership of bank accounts.  About 30.2% of U.S. households own a mutual fund whereas over  87% of households have a bank account.  But the population of mutual fund owners is expanding rapidly.  It included 24% of households in 1990, 12% in 1984 and only 6% in 1980.  Mutual fund owners also tend to be more affluent than other groups.  In 1994, 57% of households with incomes above $75,000 had mutual funds compared to 40% for the $35,000-50,000 income group and 13% for people with incomes below $25,000 per annum. The mutual fund industry will benefit as well from the fact that younger people are more accustomed to using mutual funds as outlets for their savings than older people.  At present, 27% of households in the age group 35-45 own mutual funds compared to 33% for people in the age group 44-64 and 21% for people aged 65 and over.

<P>

The ratio of mutual fund assets to GDP in the U.S. is now at 38% or the highest among the major industrial nations.  The country with the second highest ratio of mutual fund assets to GDP is France at 35% but over seventy five percent of French assets are in money market funds and bond funds whereas in the U.S. equities account for 45% of the industry's assets.  Germany has the lowest ratio of mutual fund assets to GDP among the major industrial nations.  It is only 5.2% and just 25% of mutual fund assets are invested in equities.  Other major English speaking nations have ratios of mutual funds assets to GDP in the 14-15% range.  In Britain, the ratio is 14.4% and practically all of the assets are in equities because the  tax system discourages retail demand for bond funds.  In Canada, mutual fund assets are equal to 14.5% of GDP and half of the assets are in equities.  The Japanese stock market is so dominated by corporate cross shareholdings that retail investors own only about one fourth of corporate equity.  As a result, the ratio of mutual fund assets to GDP is only 9.5% and fixed income funds account for about 67% of industry assets.

<P>

Ironically, the factor which produced such a dramatic expansion of the mutual fund industry during the 1990's was a monetary policy designed to rescue American banks from a sharp rise in non-performing real estate loans. After 1991, the Federal Reserve reduced nominal short-term interest rates to 3.0% or the lowest level in three decades in order to boost the profits of the U.S. banking system.  The positive shape of the yield curve permitted U.S. banks to significantly bolster their lending margins, earn healthy profits from their large portfolios of long term government bonds (U.S. banks had more government bonds than commercial loans in 1993) and boost their equity/asset ratios to the highest level since the 1960's.  But low money market yields and a positively sloped yield curve have also encouraged households to shift savings flows from bank deposits into higher yielding instruments, such as bond and equity mutual funds.

<B>Activity Summary:  </B>The Growth Fund of Spain, Inc. gained 3.31%
on a net asset value basis and 3.19% in market price during October,
both in U.S. dollars.  The Spanish stock market continued to perform
well, backed by the strength of the telecommunications sector,
the banking sector and the electric utilities sector which all
continue to benefit from deregulation and a lower interest-rate
environment.  The food sector suffered the biggest losses with
the recent tax hike on cigarettes starting to affect the profit
margins of tobacco producer Tabacalera.  Going forward, the managers
do not rule out a minor correction in the near term, but they
anticipate that the effects will be short lived.

<B>November 19, 1996, Chicago, Illinois -- </B>Kemper Intermediate Government
Trust declared a monthly distribution on October 31, 1996, of
$0.055 per share, payable November 29, 1996, to shareholders of
record on November 15, 1996. This is unchanged from the previous
monthly dividend. It is anticipated that, in the current interest
rate environment, a portion of the monthly distribution may constitute
a return of capital.
<P>
<B>Activity Summary:</B> Reports of slower economic growth and a rally
in the Treasury market supported strong returns in the government
bond market in October. Kemper Intermediate Government Trust
gained 1.72% in net asset value and 0.75% in market value. Treasuries
outperformed mortgages and were favored by the fund's portfolio
managers. The fund benefited as yields declined due to its modestly
extended duration.
<P>
<B>Fund Objective:</B>  To provide high current income consistent with
preservation of capital by investing in U.S. Government securities
and foreign government securities.  The fund's shares are not
guaranteed by the U.S. Government.

on November 15, 1996. This amount is unchanged from the previous
monthly dividend.
<P>
<B>Activity Summary:</B> Kemper Multi-Market Income Trust, gained 1.14%
in net asset value and 1.99% in market price in October. The fund's
performance was inhibited by an underperformance of high yield
single B credits and media/cable related issues.  The fund's exposure
to high yield bonds was reduced to 35% from 40% in anticipation
of an underperformance of the high yield market as a whole.  This
reduction enabled the managers to increase the fund's position
in Treasuries and foreign non-dollar bonds.
<P>
<B>Fund Objective:</B>  High current income consistent with prudent total
return asset management by investing assets in a broad range of
income producing securities. Investment by the fund in lower rated
bonds and foreign securities presents special risk considerations.

<B>November 19, 1996, Chicago, Illinois --</B> Kemper  Municipal Income
Trust declared a monthly dividend on October 31, 1996, of $0.0725
per common share, payable November 29, 1996, to shareholders of
record on November 15, 1996. This is unchanged from the previous
monthly dividend.
<P>
<B>Activity Summary: </B> Kemper Municipal Income Trust gained 1.10% in
net asset value, while slipping 0.42% in market value in October.
<P>
The municipal market was volatile in October as investors debated
the outcome of the congressional elections and whether or not
the Federal Reserve Board would tighten rates.<B> </B>Supply was
moderately heavy ($14.8 billion) and was met with relatively modest
demand. <I>The Bond Buyer</I> 25-Bond Revenue Index, began the
month at 6.01% (9/26/96), dropped to 5.95% (10/3/96), then fell to
5.94% (10/31/96). The municipal to Treasury yield ratio rose to
89% from 87% during the month. Portfolio Manager Chris Mier looks
for rates to remain stable with a bias to move lower.  He anticipates
moderate supply.
<P>
<B>Fund Objective:</B>  To provide a high level of current income exempt
from Federal income taxes by investing in a diversified portfolio
of investment grade tax-exempt municipal securities.   Income
may be subject to state and local taxes and a portion may be subject
to the alternative minimum tax for some investors.

<B>November 19, 1996, Chicago, Illinois --</B> Kemper Strategic Income
Fund declared a monthly dividend on October 31, 1996, of $0.147
per share, payable November 29, 1996, to shareholders of record
on November 15, 1996. This amount is unchanged from the previous
monthly dividend.
<P>
<B>Activity Summary:</B> After several strong months of performance,
Kemper Strategic Income Fund decelerated somewhat in October.
 The fund returned 0.99% in net asset value (NAV), underperforming
the 1.61% average return of its Lipper peer group.  A 5.38% gain
in market price, however, boosted the fund's premium to 18% over
NAV. The weaker NAV performance was the result of holdings in Brazil,
which impaired performance in the emerging markets allocation.
<P>
<B>Fund Objective:</B>  To provide high current income by investing its
assets in a combination of (1) lower-rated corporate fixed-income
securities, (2) fixed-income securities of emerging market and
other foreign issuers and (3) fixed-income securities of the U.S.
Government and its agencies and instrumentalities and private
mortgage-backed issuers. Investment by the fund in lower rated
bonds and in foreign securities presents special risk considerations.

<BR>
<B>November 19, 1996, Chicago, Illinois -- </B>Kemper Strategic Municipal
Income Trust declared a monthly dividend on October 31, 1996 of
$0.068 per share, payable November 29, 1996, to shareholders of
record on November 15, 1996.  This is unchanged from the previous
monthly dividend.
<P>
<B>Activity Summary: </B> Kemper Strategic Municipal Income Trust advanced
0.82% in net asset value and 1.60% in market value in October.
<P>
The municipal market was volatile in October as investors debated
the outcome of the congressional elections and whether or not
the Federal Reserve Board would tighten rates.<B> </B>Supply was
moderately heavy ($14.8 billion) and was met with relatively modest
demand. <I>The Bond Buyer</I> 25-Bond Revenue Index, began the
month at 6.01% (9/26/96), dropped to 5.95% (10/3/96), then fell to
5.94% (10/31/96). The municipal to Treasury yield ratio rose to
89% from 87% during the month. Portfolio Manager Chris Mier looks
for rates to remain stable with a bias to move lower.  He anticipates
moderate supply.
<P>
<B>Fund Objective: </B> To provide a high level of current income exempt
from Federal income taxes by investing in a diversified portfolio
of tax-exempt municipal securities. Income may be subject to state
and local taxes and a portion may be subject to the alternative
minimum tax for some investors.

<IMG BORDER=0 SRC="gifs/growth_title.gif" ALT="The GROWTH Investing Strategy">
<P>
<IMG BORDER=0 SRC="gifs/growth_head.gif" ALT="Riding the Surge of Hard-Charging Companies"><BR>
Growth style equity investors earn their spurs by roping in hot-performing companies and riding their rising earnings for as long as they can.
<P>
For the growth stockpicker, the game plan is simple: <B>Earnings drive stock prices, so invest in those companies that are outearning the market.</B> "We focus on the fastest growing sectors of the market or economy and invest in leading companies that have historically delivered consistent earnings growth. Most importantly, we look for growth stocks selling at a reasonable price," says Patrick Adams, portfolio manager of the $2.7 billion <A HREF="../../funds/growth.html">Kemper Growth Fund</A> (as of 9/30/96).
<P>

<IMG BORDER=0 SRC="gifs/growth_criteria.gif" ALT="Kemper Growth Stock Selection Criteria">

<P>

<IMG BORDER=0 SRC="gifs/growth_subhd1.gif" ALT="Throwing A Lasso Around Growing Companies"><BR>
Growth stock followers scan the investment horizon, hoping to catch a glimpse of that rarest of breeds -- successful companies with the potential to sustain growth over the long term. Industry heavyweights like Microsoft, Disney, and Home Depot come to mind.
<P>
In searching for these stocks, analysts look for the indicators that point to a sunny earnings forecast. They pursue firms with healthy profits, rising sales, and rock-solid balance sheets. They dig beyond the numbers to unearth market leaders with strong management teams, superior products, and minimal competition. They scour the corporate landscape in search of innovative technologies.

<P>

<IMG BORDER=0 SRC="gifs/growth_subhd2.gif" ALT="Seeking Less Risk, To Boot"><BR>
High-flying earnings potential, however, is only part of the Kemper growth equation. To avoid being saddled with unnecessary risks, you also have to factor in the price of your growth.
<P>
"The key is to reap the potential rewards of growth stock investing without overpaying for that growth," says Tom Regner, equity strategist for Zurich Kemper Investments. "It's a philosophy we at Kemper Funds call <B>'growth at the right price,' or 'GARP.'</B>"
<P>
It's also a philosophy that calls for even deeper levels of research, a strong suit of the Zurich Kemper Investment organization. A company's earnings must not only be accurately projected, they must also be measured against its stock price to determine whether the anticipated growth is underpriced, overvalued, or priced fairly.
<P>
"Look for opportunities where all the good news is not yet reflected in the stock's price," explains Mr. Regner. "If you can find a company that's 20% more expensive than the market but growing 40% faster, buy it."
<P>
But when to sell? Like any good investment style, the growth philosophy is ruled by clear-cut buy and sell disciplines. <B>The time to end the ride is when the stock reaches its fair market value or a decline in earnings is anticipated.</B>

<P>

<IMG BORDER=0 SRC="gifs/growth_subhd3.gif" ALT="A Classic, Straightforward Approach To Growth"><BR>
Kemper's growth philosophy focuses on stocks that don't depend on the economy for their success. "We follow a bottom-up approach where company fundamentals, not the economy, steer us toward great companies at attractive prices," says Mr. Adams. As an example of this "growth at the right price" philosophy, he points to the stocks in the Kemper Growth Fund, which have enjoyed an 18% long-term growth rate (as of 9/30/96).
<P>
While the fortunes of some growth stocks may not be tied to the economy, <B>certain industries fare better in different cycles.</B> When the economy cools, for instance, growth managers tend to look toward health care and financial stocks. Their attention may shift, however, to technology and consumer products as the economy heats up.
<P>
Much of the results of a growth portfolio will typically come in the form of capital appreciation. As a general rule, growth companies pay low dividend yields, choosing instead to reinvest their earnings for continuing expansion.

<P>

<IMG BORDER=0 SRC="gifs/growth_subhd4.gif" ALT="A Range of Growth Options"><BR>
While growth stocks share several key characteristics, they come in many shapes and sizes. In the <A HREF="../../funds/bluechip.html">Kemper Blue Chip Fund</A>, you'll find household names, such as Eli Lilly and B.F. Goodrich. The <A HREF="../../funds/smallcapequity.html">Kemper Small Capitalization Equity Fund</A> features emerging companies like Tellabs. And the long-standing <A HREF="../../funds/technology.html">Kemper Technology Fund</A> holds today's leading innovators, including 3Com and U.S. Robotics. (Keep in mind that portfolio composition and holdings are subject to change, and investments in smaller companies present greater risk than investments in larger, more established companies.)
<P>
When compared to the value school, growth provides a more conventional, mainstream approach. And so, it appeals to droves of investors who are naturally lured by the sparkle of the brightest corporate lights, the promise of the market's latest trendsetters, and the prestige of some of Wall Street's best-known names -- companies that often change the way we live, work, and play.

<P>
<IMG BORDER=0 SRC="gifs/value_head.gif" ALT="Bravely Entering The Arena Of Contrarian Stocks"><BR>

Like the courageous matador, the value investor stands firm in the face of lowered expectations surrounding a stock.
<P>
<B>Value represents a contrarian style,</B> finding beautiful swans where the rest of the market sees ugly ducklings. It pursues the downtrodden and overlooked -- stocks of viable companies that are currently out-of-favor and on sale at bargain prices.
<P>
"We look for stocks that are unloved for the wrong reason," says David Dreman, chairman of Dreman Value Advisors and a leading champion of value investing. "We believe there will be enough positive earnings surprises or opinion changes, so that these companies will outperform the market over time." Regarded as a pioneer among contrarians, Mr. Dreman currently manages the <A HREF="../../funds/high_return.html">Kemper-Dreman High Return Fund</A>, ranked by Lipper as the number one mutual fund in the equity-income category over the one-year, five-year, and life-of-fund time periods as of 9/30/96.*  (One yr. - 1/147; five yr. - 1/57; life - 1/37)

<P>

<IMG BORDER=0 SRC="gifs/value_subhd1.gif" ALT="Sidestepping Investor Fears"><BR>
In the topsy-turvy arena of investing, value disciples count on one predictable outcome: investor over-reaction to bad news, which inevitably sends short-term stock prices tumbling to levels much lower than their earnings would suggest. Bad news can come in many forms -- a disappointing earnings quarter, concerns over the economy in general, disturbing news out of the White House.
<P>
Investors were seeing red, for example, during the 1993 debate over health care reform. Health care stocks nosedived, and value investors picked up some quality companies usually found only in the growth sector. Since then, talk of revamping the medical system has quieted, while many of those health care stocks have rebounded nicely.
<P>
What does a Kemper-Dreman value stock look like? <B>Its most distinguishing characteristic is a low price-to-earnings ratio,</B> the holy grail pursued by most value investors. In addition to a small price tag, however, value stocks must show signs of financial strength, along with above-average dividend yields and historical growth of earnings and dividends -- qualities found today in companies such as Fannie Mae, Banc One, and Philip Morris.

<P>

<IMG BORDER=0 SRC="gifs/value_subhd2.gif" ALT="The Discipline To Stand Your Ground"><BR>
Value investing appeals to the bargain hunter in all of us. It's the same force that compels us to buy our swimwear and lawn furniture in the dead of winter.
<P>
But value also attracts the patient and disciplined investor. It takes time for out-of-favor companies to achieve the turnaround that value investors bank on. And it takes discipline to follow the strict principles of the Kemper-Dreman strategy, which means <B>selling stocks when P/E ratios approach the market average,</B> regardless of how favorable their prospects appear.
<P>
While some critics maintain that value is a riskier proposition, supporters maintain just the opposite. The stock's prices and expectations are already low, they argue, so additional downturns can't do much damage. "Put it this way. You will probably get hurt worse falling from a high ladder than from a small step stool," observes Mr. Dreman.

<P>

<IMG BORDER=0 SRC="gifs/value_subhd3.gif" ALT="The Finesse And Confidence Of The Contrarian"><BR>
Many recent academic studies suggest that contrarians may be onto something with their strategy of pursuing stocks with low price-to-earnings ratios.

</TABLE>

Mr. Dreman has devoted his life's work to studying the performance of low-priced stocks. His much-published analysis of 1,500 large companies has shown that low P/E stocks outperformed high P/Es over a 20-year period (see chart at right). In fact, the cheapest stocks in the study topped the market average for annual returns by a margin of 17.2% to 14.7%. The most expensive stocks, on the other hand, posted average annual returns of just 11.2%.
<P>
Mr. Dreman's research looks at total return, including both appreciation and dividends. Because value stocks pay higher-than-average dividends, they tend to weather down markets better than growth stocks. When times are tough, it's often those dividend returns that help to prop up stock prices and provide a measure of capital protection.

<BR CLEAR=ALL>
<P>


<IMG BORDER=0 SRC="gifs/value_subhd4.gif" ALT="A Variety Of Value Opportunities"><BR>
Other research shows that low-priced stocks performed better than big-ticket stocks among companies of all sizes. As a result, the Kemper-Dreman team has applied their contrarian school of thought to their entire line of value portfolios.
<P>
The <A HREF="../../funds/contrarian.html">Kemper-Dreman Contrarian Fund</A>, for example, pursues large cap companies such as General Electric and Mobil. At the other end of the spectrum, the Kemper-Dreman Small Cap Value Fund consists of smaller companies, like Bally Entertainment. And the Kemper-Dreman High Return Fund focuses mostly on larger companies, which currently include Amoco and Humana. As noted earlier, portfolio composition and holdings are subject to change.

<IMG BORDER=0 SRC="gifs/growth_and_value_head.gif" ALT="Working In Tandem For A Smoother Ride"><BR>


By now, you've seen that growth and value are vastly different styles of equity investing. Growth pursues fashionable companies in the penthouse, while value roots around for buried treasures in the bargain basement. Value likes underpriced stocks; growth likes oversized earnings.
<P>
So the question may still linger: <B>Growth or value?</B> Which style is best suited to you as a long-term investor looking to help reduce risks? <B>Both.</B> Like cowboy boots and the matador's slippers, investment styles work best in pairs. For the savvy investor, the issue is not one of growth or value, but rather growth and value. Why? In a word, diversification.

<P>

<IMG BORDER=0 SRC="gifs/growth_and_value_subhd1.gif" ALT="A Two-Handed Approach To Diversifying"><BR>
Every investment professional preaches the value of diversification. Don't put all your eggs in one basket, they advise. Spread your investments across several instruments as a way of helping lower risk.
<P>
Good advice, but many investors fail to realize that real diversification occurs when investments are also spread across the two styles of growth and value.
<P>
Yes, the two disciplines are radically different approaches to stock investing, but investors must come to view them as complementary, not competing. There's plenty of room for both in a well-rounded investment portfolio.
<P>
<B>"Using only one investment style is like rowing a boat with only one oar,"</B> says Steve Reynolds, chief investment officer of equities for Zurich Kemper Investments. "You may eventually reach your destination, but it's going to be a tougher trip."
<P>

</TABLE>

Despite their many differences, growth and value actually share some significant common threads. Both techniques pursue financially strong, quality companies with steady track records of growth. And, in the case of Kemper's "growth at the right price" philosophy, both also seek mispriced stocks that are selling below their real, or intrinsic, value. For the ambidextrous investor who's equally adept at growth and value, a blended portfolio of both styles may produce better results than a "one-handed" approach.
<P>
And then there's risk to think about.
<P>
If the diversification preachers are right, a portfolio of growth and value should carry lower risks than an all-growth or all-value strategy. And that's exactly what happens. An analysis (see chart at right) reveals that <B>a portfolio containing equal investments in the two styles would have had lower volatility than either style alone.</B>

<BR CLEAR=ALL>
<P>


<IMG BORDER=0 SRC="gifs/growth_and_value_subhd2.gif" ALT="Stick To Your Guns"><BR>
Growth and value are both governed by sets of strict, uncompromising principles about the buying and selling of stocks. That's why both disciplines work so well over time. But in the short term, depending on the temperature of the economy, one style usually outshines the other.
<P>

<TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=3 CELLSPACING=0 ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=180>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN=BOTTOM ALIGN=LEFT>
<IMG BORDER=0 SRC="gifs/growth_and_value_returns.gif" ALT="Annual Returns Of Growth And Value">
<P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>
Annualized returns based on year-end data from S&amp;P 500 stock groupings. The chart shows performance of the S&amp;P/Barra Growth and Value Indexes. These unmanaged indexes are generally representative of U.S. growth stocks and U.S. value stocks, respectively. The indexes  assume reinvestment of distributions and do not reflect the effects of sales charges or brokerage commissions. Fund holdings and performance will differ. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.
</FONT>
<P>
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

Growth and value tend to be counter-cyclical, with one style usually outperforming the other (see
table at left). This year, both styles are up, with growth surpassing value by a fairly healthy margin. Through the first nine months of 1996, the S&amp;P/Barra Growth Index was up 15.6%, compared to 13.5% for the S&amp;P 500 and 11.4% for the S&amp;P/Barra Value Index.
<P>
The tendency of growth and value to flip-flop positions as top performer can be both a blessing and a curse. For the wise investor who steadfastly commits to both schools, it means better diversification. For the impetuous investor, however, the temptation may be to switch back and forth between growth and value, pledging allegiance to whichever style happens to be in vogue at the time. Unfortunately, most of these chameleons tend to jump ship just when their abandoned style is about to set sail.
<P>
"Style switching is one of the main reasons investors and fund managers underperform the market," says Mr. Reynolds. "Style switchers almost never win. That's why it's so important to know that your fund managers are dedicated to their investment style."
<P>
<B>A portfolio of growth and value also provides an additional benefit -- less duplication of stocks.</B> A mutual fund investor, for instance, may choose three different growth funds that each invest in the same industries, maybe even the same companies. While there may be occasional overlaps between growth and value, the two styles generally cast their lines in entirely different waters.
<P>
In the end, the smart investor will resist the urge to time the market and remain faithful to the proven styles of growth and value. "Without a strong commitment to your investment styles, the market usually takes advantage of you instead of you taking advantage of the market," notes Mr. Reynolds.
<P>
So commit to an investment style. Better yet, commit to two. Armed with the cowboy's lasso in one hand and the matador's cape in the other, you'll be fully equipped to take the bull by the horns when you take on your investment challenges.
<P>
Please note that there is no guarantee that a particular management style will be successful and that the past performance of a particular style is not representative of future results.

Astute investors don't buy individual mutual funds; they build diversified portfolios of funds -- some growth and some value, some small cap and some large cap. The challenge is often not in the diversifying, but in finding one company that can provide such a variety of investment options.

<P>

<IMG BORDER=0 SRC="gifs/diversified_subhd1.gif" ALT="One Source For A Well-Rounded Portfolio"><BR>
<A HREF="../../about/aboutzki.html">Zurich Kemper Investments</A> is the nation's only mutual fund complex where growth and value are managed independently by separate organizations with their own headquarters, management teams, portfolio managers, analysts, and even two chief investment officers. Zurich Kemper Investments, located in Chicago, manages the firm's growth portfolios, while New York-based Dreman Value Advisors, Inc., founded by contrarian pioneer David Dreman, directs the value side.
<P>
Today, Zurich Kemper Investments continues to add new members to its worldwide organization, bringing in experienced experts who are well-versed and fully committed to the Kemper Funds' styles of growth and value investing, as well as their renowned fixed-income and international portfolios.
<P>
Zurich Kemper Investments' trademark since 1948 has been research. Both disciplines rely heavily on accurate primary research to identify quality stocks at affordable prices. Says Steve Reynolds, chief investment officer of equities: <B>"The cornerstone of the Kemper Funds investment process is solid research, both quantitative and qualitative.</B> It's research that enables our portfolio managers to recognize stocks that are selling at bargain prices in the growth and value sectors and are likely to experience significant price appreciation."

Where is my money? Why is it there? How is it doing? These are the
questions that every investor needs to ask. But it's a broader curiosity
that leads an individual investor to want to know more about what
happens when investment dollars are put to work.
<P>

There are few subjects that are as engrossing as investing can be. For
those who like to measure change and plot performance progress, the
investment world offers plenty of analytical tools. Yet others develop
an interest in investing as a means to an end. These curious investors
apply what they know about investing as they pursue lifetime goals:
financing a child's education, acquiring a vacation home or providing
for a carefree retirement. 
<P>

Whatever the source of your curiosity, we hope to pique it in Snapshots,
quick glimpses of the state of the U.S. economy and financial markets,
and The Longer View, a series of articles on general investing topics.

The economy provides an environment, but the markets are where
investments perform. Securities are bought and sold in many types and
sizes of markets. There are money markets for short-term investors, U.S.
and foreign markets for equities investors and a wide range of U.S. and
foreign government and corporate markets for income investors. Any
number of variables - corporate earnings, government stability,
interest rate movements, just to name a few - influence these markets
and, by extension, your success as an investor.

<IMG SRC="gifs/dear_subhead.gif"><BR>

As we approach the close of 1996, it's remarkable how eventful the year has been and yet, economically, we are essentially where we were one year ago. 
<P>
The fundamentals of the economy are remarkably similar today to what they were in 1995. Long-term interest rates are approximately 6.5% compared to 6.3% in November 1995. The economy is growing at a rate of approximately 2.2%. Inflation continues to be well under control, at about 3.0%.  
<P>
One significant difference between today and one year ago is that stock prices are on average up 20%. While price movements were more volatile in 1996 than in the past few years, the patient investor was amply rewarded. The prime element sending the stock market higher was strong positive cash flows. Such liquidity in an environment of modestly increasing corporate profits and relatively stable interest rates pushed stocks higher for most of the year. 
<P>
This higher stock market has caused many market observers to worry. While we cannot ignore what has happened, we find no reason to be bearish over the long term. The environment is benign to favorable for financial assets. Given steady interest rates, moderate economic growth and continued moderate corporate earnings growth, there are few excesses in the system.  In fact, real interest rates are probably too high considering our outlook for inflation, and we may see them decline over time.
<P>
Naturally, we cannot rule out the possibility of a market correction. But, in our belief, the downside would appear to be limited to 5% to 8%, which is the size of a typical correction based on historical data. As we have said in previous outlooks, three elements tend to move the market:
<UL TYPE=CIRCLE> 
<LI><B>Earnings.</B> We forecast corporate earnings to range between 0% and 5% on average for the Standard &amp; Poor's 500* in 1997 -- not as high as in recent previous years but positive nonetheless.
<P>
<LI><B>Interest rates.</B> Rates should remain stable, and short-term interest rates may even decline.
<P>
<LI><B>Liquidity.</B> Investors, through mutual funds, 401(k)s and qualified contribution plans in particular, will continue to create strong demand for securities.
</UL>
<P>
In order to move the market more than would be expected in a typical decline, one or more of these elements will have to turn negative in 1997, and, while future conditions cannot be predicted with certainty, we fail to see what would materially change our outlook. Our outlook going forward is that 1997 should be a lot like 1996.
<P>
While the economy continued along a relatively consistent path, the United States took some politically significant steps in 1996. First, of course, President Bill Clinton and a Republican Congress were re-elected by the voters. In the first few days after the general election, especially, investors demonstrated their support for such a balance in our leadership. But of much greater long-term significance is the expressed commitment by both parties to balance the federal budget and address certain entitlement programs. The first year after an election can be a fertile time to accomplish major initiatives, and we are hopeful that progress can be made.
<P>
The future of the Social Security system, which many experts believe will run out of money about 20 years from now, will be a subject in which you can expect Zurich Kemper Investments to play a leadership role. The possible solutions for "fixing Social Security" are finite: raise Social Security taxes, reduce benefits, raise the retirement age, change inflation assumptions or pursue a higher rate of return on assets contributed by workers. We believe that a bipartisan solution will be worked out, which will include giving individuals the option of investing a portion of their Social Security contributions in an account earmarked for them. This change is needed to return credibility to the system, which many Americans have lost faith in. What to do with Social Security is a debate that spans generations and promises to occupy much attention in the coming years. As we hope to help advance constructive debate, we'll be advocating partial privatization for this federal program while maintaining a safety net for many low-wage earners and providing a seamless transition for seniors near or in retirement.
<P>
With this letter as an economic backdrop, we encourage you to read the following detailed report of your fund, including an interview with your fund's portfolio management. Thank you for your continued support. We appreciate the opportunity to serve your investment needs.

Sincerely,

Kemper Funds originated in Chicago in 1948, when five entrepreneurs formed a mutual fund to capitalize on a technological breakthrough called television. Much - the company's name, ownership and scope of its funds' investments - has changed since then. While Kemper headquarters today remain in Chicago, the company's reach extends far and wide. We share our success with the many friends, neighbors and partners we invite you to meet on the following pages.

investors can't afford to be erratic. As significant and as interesting
as financial market news may be, it's essential for investors to
maintain a certain perspective. Taking a longer view, considering basic
investment principles and tactics, can help a curious investor be a calm
investor.
<BR><BR>

Think of The Longer View as your gateway to general investment and
educational information.

Most investing is done for the long term. But investors who are looking
for a temporary stopping place or who have only a short time for their
money to work have certain needs. If you're a short-term investor, your
desire to maintain a stable principal may guide the investment decisions
you make. We have some ideas just for you.

As an investor, you have a schedule of your own. You know when your
child will be entering college or the number of years until you plan to
retire, for example. But what can be complicated about investing is that
your investing cycle - when you invest and when you use the proceeds -
takes place within the realm of a broader cycle. Your objective as an
investor is to find a way to dovetail your investing cycle with the
unpredictable ups and downs of the overall economy. 

<BR><BR>

Planning for Your Child's Future includes what you can do with your own
investments as well as the possibilities with a child's portfolio.
<BR><BR>

Be sure to visit Your Retirement for insights on the all-important task
of planning for your retirement.

<P>
Kemper manages seven closed-end funds designed to meet varying financial goals. Six funds invest in the fixed-income or municipal markets while one fund invests primarily in Spanish equities. 
<P>
A closed-end fund differs from an "open-end" fund (commonly referred to as a "mutual fund") in several important ways:<BR>
<UL TYPE=CIRCLE>
<LI>A closed-end fund is usually capitalized through a one-time public offering. New shares may be created only in certain circumstances -- to satisfy dividend reinvestment plan requirements with respect to income and capital gains distributions and occasionally rights offerings, for example. By contrast, an open-end fund continuously issues new shares.
<LI>Once issued, the shares of a closed-end fund are not redeemable by the fund and are exchangeable only in the open market, generally by a listing on a recognized stock exchange.  Shares of Kemper's closed-end funds are traded on the <A HREF="http://www.nyse.com/">New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)</A> and the <A HREF="http://www.chicagostockex.com/">Chicago Stock Exchange (CSE)</A>. Shares of an open-end fund, by contrast, are redeemable by the fund at any time.
<LI>Because the supply of shares of a closed-end fund is finite, the market price of a closed-end fund share is based upon the forces of supply and demand. 
Shares may trade at either above or below their net asset value (NAV) based on their perceived value in the marketplace. This price differential is referred to as a premium or discount to NAV.  Again, by contrast, an open-end fund stands ready at all times to redeem its shares at their current NAV.
<LI>Because all trading of a closed-end fund's shares takes place in the open market, the portfolio manager of a closed-end fund does not need to worry about maintaining cash balances to fund share redemptions. This tends to give the manager more latitude to fully invest the portfolio and to consider a broader range of portfolio securities.

At Kemper Funds, we believe that establishing a relationship with
a professional financial representative is the best way to take
advantage of today's investment alternatives. Mutual funds are excellent
building blocks for your portfolio, with their built-in diversification,
professional management and convenience. And, with over 6,000 funds
available today, we believe the best way to choose among them is with
the guidance and advice of a professional financial advisor.

Kemper Funds believes that working with financial representatives is an
investor's best approach for achieving his or her goals in today's
complex and global investment markets. Kemper Funds are offered by
many financial representatives, including broker/dealers, financial
planners, insurance agents and bank investment counselors. 
<BR><BR>

This part of Kemper.com is restricted because communications created for
registered financial representatives do not include the same disclosures
required of
communications for the general public or fund shareholders. A registered
representative is someone who has completed extensive coursework in investment
company products. Much of the information presented in this area is
available, with additional disclosure, elsewhere on the site. Other material was
created for Kemper Funds' sales force and not relevant to the general
public.

The most distinctive feature of the world's financial markets this
autumn is their capacity for accepting increased political risks
in the pursuit of higher asset returns. <I>Financial markets in
countries as diverse as New Zealand, Italy and the Ukraine are
experiencing rallies which suggest that the world is awash with
surplus liquidity and that investors believe the commitment to
liberal economic reform which swept the Anglo-Saxon world after
the first Thatcher election victory of 1979 is immune to electoral
reversals. </I>
<P>
After ten years of supporting one of the world's most aggressive
economic liberalization programs, the voters of New Zealand have
elected a new parliament in which three left of center and populist
political parties will have 55% of the seats. Yet instead of declining,
New Zealand's debt and equity markets rallied on the perception
that the election will probably be irrelevant to the country's
economic performance. Optimists believe that the forces of the
post cold war global marketplace are too powerful for any new
left-wing government to restore New Zealand's pre-1984 tradition
of protectionism and lavish welfare spending. A few pundits even
hope that the election has left the parliament so fragmented that
it will be impossible for the parties to form an effective government.
The 1996 New Zealand election was the first held under the country's
new system of proportional representation and thus encouraged
far more fragmentation than the traditional Westminster system
of electing M.P.'s (single member seats awarded to the candidate
with a plurality of votes).
<P>
In early October, the international credit rating agencies gave
Russia a series of ratings which ranged from BB+ (IBCA) to BB-
(S&amp;P 500) with Moody's in the middle at BA2. Such ratings
place Russia towards the upper end of the Brady bond market, ahead
of Brazil but still below Poland. There is little doubt that Russia
will someday deserve a high credit rating. It has immense natural
resources, a low ratio of government debt to GDP and during the
decade before 1914 was one of the world's high growth economies
and large scale capital importers. But the decision to award such
a high credit rating when Russia's political situation is in a
state of flux provides further confirmation of the financial community's
increasing tolerance for risk. Meanwhile, the improvement in Russia's
credit rating has caused such a large rally in Russian debt prices
that adventuresome investors are now shifting capital from the
Russian securities market to the Ukraine. The economic reform
program in the Ukraine has been lagging far behind Russia's, so
the yield on Ukrainian government debt was still above 70% in
September. But as a result of the flight from quality in Russia,
yields on Ukrainian Treasury bills have plunged to barely 50%
during the past two weeks despite a projected inflation rate of
112% this year. Russia's yields also have stabilized at about
50-55% compared to 150-200% during the spring.
<P>
The bond markets of Italy and Spain have also experienced major
rallies since August in the expectation that European governments
will introduce a broad based monetary union in 1999 despite the
failure of several countries to comply with the spirit, if not
the letter, of the Maastricht terms for economic convergence.
The yield gap between German and Italian bonds has fallen from
650 basis points eighteen months ago to just over 200 basis points
today. <I>Investors have bid up the price of Italian securities
in the expectation that German politicians will permit Italy to
enter the monetary union in 1999 despite the fact that the country's
ratio of public debt to GDP is almost 120% compared to a Maastricht
target of 60%.</I> The market's new optimism about Italy's entry
to EMU is based on the fact that the German officials appear willing
to accept liberal interpretations of the Maastricht agreement
for France and Belgium. They are permitting France to achieve
its deficit target through one time revenue transfers from the
pension funds of state enterprises. They seem willing to let Belgium
enter the union despite the fact that her ratio of public debt
to GDP exceeds 100%. In recent days, Bundesbank officials and
members of the Social Democratic Party responsible for monitoring
monetary policy have begun to suggest that they will not encourage
entry for countries which engage in accounting adjustments to
reduce their fiscal deficit to 3.0% of GDP. But investors have
not focused on these objections because of hopes that they will
at most delay EMU entry for Spain and Italy by two or three years,
not postpone it until all the Maastricht conditions are satisfied.
While German officials can persuade their public to accept Belgian
membership at the start of EMU, Italy is too large a country to
enter under current circumstances despite the fact that Italy
was among the original six countries which signed the Treaty of
Rome creating the European Common Market in 1958.
<P>
When one considers the resilience of the New Zealand financial
market and the aggressive investor demand for bonds in Europe's
peripheral debt markets during recent weeks, it is not surprising
that the Dow Jones Industrial average has reached new highs during
October. The outlook for the U.S. economy is still benign. The
markets have been discounting a Clinton victory in the presidential
election for several weeks while investors remain hopeful that
the Republicans will retain at least a narrow majority in both
houses of the Congress.

<P>
The Fed's decision to leave U.S. interest rates unchanged at its
meeting on September 24th has left many unresolved questions for
the financial markets to ponder.  Was the focus of the FOMC meeting
the outlook for the U.S. economy or the breach of security which
produced a Reuters story about several district banks seeking
a discount rate hike the week before the meeting?  Did the FOMC
renew its previous directive with a bias towards tightening and
thus leave open the possibility of raising interest rates in response
to economic reports during October, or has it closed the door
on possible tightening until November?  How far will the chairman
go in attempting to assert his authority over FOMC dissidents
who have attempted to campaign for a rate hike through conversations
with the media?
<P>
There is no way of telling whether the Reuters story about the
district banks altered the outcome of the FOMC meeting.  <I>If
the retail sales and inflation data published in mid-September
had showed clear signs of accelerating inflation and robust growth
in final demand, there is little doubt that the FOMC would have
hiked interest rates.</I>  But because the data suggested that
growth may be moderating and that inflation is still under control,
the Chairman was able to persuade the FOMC to defer any proposal
for tightening in order to demonstrate that he is still firmly
in control of the Federal Reserve.  It is doubtful, though, that
the FOMC abandoned its bias in favor of tightening.  On the contrary,
if the employment report scheduled to appear on October 4th shows
signs of strong growth in the U.S. economy, the Fed could move
to hike interest rates immediately.  Almost 90% of the upward
move in U.S. bond yields this year has occurred in the minutes
after three employment reports showing large monthly job gains.
 If the October 4th report produces evidence of large job gains
(over 250,000) and the unemployment rate drops below 5.0%, there
will probably be another upward spike in bond yields so large
that the Fed will feel compelled to show that it has not become
totally passive.  The rally in the bond market after the Fed decision
to leave interest rates unchanged demonstrates that investors
are as uncertain about the U.S. economic outlook as the FOMC.
 But since the preconditions for an acceleration of wage growth
and a revival of inflation clearly exist, the Fed cannot afford
to procrastinate for long when new data appears confirming that
the economy is still expanding at a growth rate well above 2.0%.
<P>
<I>There is little disagreement at the Federal Reserve that the
preconditions for a revival of inflation are appearing.</I>  <I>The
dissension about policy centers on three questions.</I>  First,
is the third quarter slowdown in domestic final sales growth to
1.5-2.0% from 4.8% during the second quarter temporary or the
start of a prolonged trend?  Secondly, is government data understating
productivity growth and thus causing policy makers to be overly
pessimistic about the economy's optimal non-inflationary growth
rate?  Thirdly, if wages do accelerate further, will corporations
be able to pass on the cost hikes to consumers or will they simply
erode profit margins?
<P>
The answer to the first question will be provided by forthcoming
retail sales and capital goods orders data for September and October.
 The growth of consumer spending did slow sharply during the third
quarter (it appears to be 1.2% compared to 3.4% during the first
half) but it should not remain subdued if employment continues
to expand at a steady rate and consumers remain confident.  The
September Conference Board survey of consumer confidence is positive
on both counts.  It shows that confidence remained close to 112
for a second consecutive month during September compared to 100
in June.  Household perceptions of the job market also were very
positive.  About 27.0% said that jobs were plentiful compared
to 24.8% during June while only 20.8% said jobs were hard to get
compared to 22.0-23.6% during the second quarter.  <I>If resilient
consumer confidence produces a rebound in retail sales during
the autumn, real GDP growth will probably accelerate to the 3.0-3.5%
range during the fourth quarter from 2.0-2.5% during the third
quarter.</I>  Business fixed investment also should expand at
a 5.0-6.0% annual rate during the second half compared to 4.0%
during the second quarter and 11.6% during the first quarter.
 While the computer sector is experiencing a slowdown, the high
level of manufacturing capacity utilization rates, the 10-12%
profit growth now occurring in the corporate sector, and the high
value of American share prices in relation to asset replacement
costs should encourage other sectors to expand their investment
outlays.
<P>
<I>The current financial environment in the U.S. today is probably
more supportive of business expansion than any other in recent
years.</I>  The number of equity I.P.O.'s was 428 during the first
half of 1996 compared to 573 during all of 1995, 571 during 1994,
and a peak of 665 during 1993.  These I.P.O.'s raised about $27.2
billion during the first half of 1996 compared to $28.9 billion
last year, $22.9 billion during 1994 and $34.0 billion during
1993.   As a result of the stock market boom, the U.S. venture
capital industry will be able to provide entrepreneurs with almost
$4 billion of new capital this year or the highest level since
1987.  According to a recent survey by the National Federation
of Independent Business, entrepreneurs established  nearly 3.5
million new businesses in the U.S. last year.  While many of these
new businesses may employ only one person, the rate of new business
formation suggests that demand for labor will persist at high
levels if firms can actually find new workers.  If rising wages
and faltering productivity starts to depress profit margins, the
business sector could turn more cautious about new hiring and
investment.  But it is difficult to find such signs of caution
in either business surveys or the financial markets at present.
<P>
The major business risk in the outlook is the rising delinquency
rates on consumer debt and the pressure it is putting on banks
to impose tougher quality  standards on people being screened
for credit cards.  But as Fed Governor Larry Lindsey explained
in recent congressional testimony, it would be imprudent to over-generalize
about the dangers poised by consumer debt until the economy starts
to experience increasing unemployment.  Lindsey reported to the
Congress,
<P><BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>&quot;Consumer delinquencies on nonmortgage debt have increased
in recent periods and bankruptcy filing could well exceed one
million in 1996.  These developments have begun to affect profit
margins at some financial institutions and the Federal Reserve
has been closely monitoring these conditions and discussing their
implications with individual banking organizations and industry
groups.  In our view, given the generally strong financial condition
of the institutions most affected by these developments and that
the U.S. banking system, these adverse trends do not currently
present a material threat either to individual banking organizations
 to the overall banking system.&quot;</I></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

The poor performance of the U.S. bond market since the decision of the Federal Open Market Committee to leave U.S. interest rates unchanged at its late August meeting reflects growing investor apprehension about the strength of the U.S. economy.  The low level of unemployment claims, the buoyancy of the equity market, and anecdotal evidence of resilient retail sales suggest that the economy is continuing to expand at an annual rate of at least 3.0%.  Such a number is not alarming by historical standards, but it is troublesome for the financial markets when it occurs against a backdrop of only 5.5% unemployment and widespread business concern about labor scarcity.  There is also increasing evidence that the government's GDP accounts may be underestimating the economy's true growth rate.  During the past year, real personal and business incomes have expanded at a rate about 1.0% higher than official measures of real output.  As the government's estimates of income and output are supposed to converge over time, it appears increasingly likely that the government's new system of GDP measurement is underestimating the economy's true growth rate.
<P>
There is evidence that the Federal Reserve is deeply divided about the inflation risks in the U.S. economy.  District presidents from the middle west have become increasingly vociferous about the danger of low unemployment pushing up wages and reviving inflationary psychology, but the new Clinton appointees to the FOMC have been reluctant to raise interest rates only a few months after their appointments.  As the Clinton appointees are mainstream economists who understand the inflation risks poised by high levels of resource utilization, it is doubtful that they will oppose monetary tightening if unemployment declines further this autumn.  But the delays in Fed tightening could still set the stage for a sharp rise in bond yields because of market concern about the Fed pursuing too passive a monetary strategy in the run-up to the presidential election.   A sharp rise in bond yields will probably also depress the equity market and provide the Dole campaign with an opportunity to raise questions about the economic outlook for 1997.
<P>
The evidence of the economy enjoying above trend growth is widespread.  The level of unemployment claims has dropped to a six year low.  The Manpower Employment survey is projecting expanded hiring activity during the fourth quarter.  Retailers are experiencing good back to school sales.  The level of capital goods orders, excluding the aircraft and defense sectors, rose to $127.8 billion during July from $125 billion during June and the second quarter average was $123.8 billion.  The July Dun and Bradstreet survey of business expectations is projecting healthy gains in both orders and production.  The production index rose to 43 from 37 in June while the order index shot up to 46 from 40 in June.  Most measures of consumer confidence are also very upbeat.  In fact, the University of  Michigan survey of consumer perceptions of government economic policy during July showed that for the first time in the history of the Clinton administration as many people now think that government policy is good (22%) as think it is poor (22%).  The Michigan index of the overall approval rating of government policy is also at 100 compared to 50-60 during late 1992 and a previous peak of 118 during the mid-1980's.
<P>
Some of the sectors which boosted output growth during the second quarter are losing momentum.  The auto industry is projecting unit sales of only 15.3 million during the second half of 1996 compared to 15.6 million during the first half. Home sales should soon respond to the uptick which occurred in mortgage rates during the spring.  As a result, residential construction activity will slow compared to annualized rates of gain of 15.1% during the second quarter and 7.4% during the first quarter.
<P>
It also is unclear how large a contribution inventory will make to the economy's third quarter growth rate.  The level of non-farm inventory accumulation shot up to $11.9 billion at annual rates during the second quarter from $2.9 billion during the first quarter and $19.0 billion during the fourth quarter of last year.  In June, it appeared that the auto industry would attempt to boost inventories during the third quarter in order to compensate for the risk of a strike during September, but the purchasing agent survey for July showed no evidence of an inventory build-up.  As inventory levels are satisfactory in most industries, inventories will not be a drag on third quarter output growth but their contribution could be quite modest compared to the second quarter.
<P>
The August Blue Chip survey of the economic consensus indicates that most American forecasters expect output growth to slow sharply by the fourth quarter.  In early August, the median forecast projected, 2.6% output growth during the third quarter, 2.1% during the fourth quarter, and 1.9% during the first quarter of 1997.  The ten most optimistic forecasters projected 3.3% growth during the third quarter and 2.9% during the fourth quarter.  The most pessimistic expected growth of only 1.8% and 1.1% during the final two quarters of 1996.

<P>
The Clinton administration should be pleased about the July
correction in U.S. equity prices.  The market has begun adjusting to the
growing likelihood of Federal Reserve tightening during August.  If the markets
had expected the Fed to remain passive, the risk would have increased of
investors becoming even more speculative than they were during the spring and
setting the stage for a dramatic stock market correction in the weeks before
the presidential election.  <i>Any Fed tightening during August will have only
a marginal effect on the economy this autumn whereas a repetition of the 1987
stock market crash would permit the Republicans to argue that the economy's
current prosperity is an illusion which will give way to recession next
year.</i><p>
<p>
While most of Wall Street is now prepared for a 25 basis point interest rate
hike this month, there continues to be considerable disagreement about the
economy's underlying strength.  As Alan Greenspan himself suggested in his
recent congressional testimony, there are good arguments for expecting final
demand growth to slow during the second half of 1996.  He said,<p>
<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
"...the support to economic growth provided by expenditures on durable goods,
both for household consumption and business fixed investment, is likely to wane
in coming quarters.  Consumer spending in the past few years has been boosted
as households have made up the purchases of big-ticket items that they had
deferred during the recession and the early, weaker phase of the recovery.
Five years after the business-cycle trough, however, we should expect that this
pent-up demand has been largely exhausted.  Moreover, many households have
built up sizable debt burdens in recent years, and coping with debt repayments
could hold down their spending.  The business sector has been adding
considerably to capacity; opportunities to invest profitably in new capital
should be increasing less rapidly as final demand slows some."</BLOCKQUOTE><p>
<p>
The problem for the Federal Reserve and investors is that the U.S. economy has
just completed an inventory sub-cycle lasting almost one year and is now poised
for a revival of stock-building.  The auto sector added about 1.0% to output
growth during the second quarter and will probably add another 0.5% during the
third quarter.  The GM strike shifted some auto output to the second quarter
while GM may build inventory during the third quarter in order to hedge against
strike risks in September  The non-auto manufacturing sector remained subdued
during the second quarter but should give a boost to output during the next few
quarters.  It is possible that the auto industry will create excess inventory
during the third quarter if there is no strike to consume it during September
but auto sales have been so responsive to price discounting that it should not
be difficult to reduce inventories quickly if the need arises.  <p>
<p>
<i>The economy's performance during the past year has been very comparable to
the gradual upturns which followed previous sub-cycles of slow growth resulting
from monetary tightening and inventory adjustments during the long expansions
of the 1960's and 1970's.</i>  Excluding weather driven disruptions of output
during January, the purchasing agent index reached a trough of 45.7 during
June, 1995 and rebounded to 54.3 during<p>
June, 1996 after fluctuating in a narrow range of 46.0-48.0 during recent
months.  The rebound in the purchasing agent index so far has been highly
comparable to the upturns which followed the slow growth sub-cycles of
1984-1985 and 1988-1989, but it has been much weaker than the recovery from the
slow growth sub-cycle of 1966-1967, when defense spending was buoyant. The
rebound in the stock market also has been very positive compared to the upturns
from previous slow growth sub-cycles.  The stock market has increased by 24%
since June, 1995 whereas during the upturn from the 1967 slowdown the gain was
only 5.0% and during the rebound from the 1989 slowdown the market declined.
<i>Monetary policy and inflation have been the critical determinant of equity
prices during all of the sub-cycles.</i>  In the late 1960's, the economy was
so overheated by the Vietnam War that monetary policy had to be tightened.  In
the 1989 sub-cycle, inflation had accelerated by enough that the Fed decided to
raise interest rates despite the sluggish growth of output.  In 1985, by
contrast, inflation was so subdued that interest rate declined and encouraged
equity prices to rise by 29% during the twelve months after the trough in the
purchasing agent index.<p>
<p>
The inflation environment today is analogous to the 1986 subcycle on the basis
of indicators such as the purchasing agent price index.  It is now about 50
compared to a trough of 40-45 twelve months ago and a peak of 70-80 two years
ago.  <i>But the level of unemployment today is 5.3% compared to an average of
7.2% during 1985.  As a result of the low level of unemployment, the major
concern of policy makers today is not industrial commodity prices but potential
upward pressure on wages.  As Chairman Greenspan noted in his recent
testimony,</i><p>
<p><blockquote>
"The economy is already producing at a high level -- and some early signs of
pressures on resources are emerging, especially in the labor market."</blockquote><p>
<p>
The uptick occurring in the level of wage growth is not alarming but it
is clear that a change of trend is underway.  The wage component of the
Employment Cost Index is now rising at an annual rate of nearly 4.0% compared
to less than 3.0% during 1995 while benefits are rising at an annual rate of
close to 3.0%.  If this acceleration continues in response to another year of
low unemployment, the core U.S. inflation rate could approach 4.0% by late
1997.  The risk facing the corporate sector is that the Fed will attempt to
prevent rising wages from pushing up prices by dampening output growth,
depressing productivity, and creating a squeeze on profit margins.<p>
<p>
The level of unemployment is now below 4.0% in two regions accounting for 10.8%
of the national labor market (the upper mid west, the plains and rocky mountain
states).  It is below 5.0% in four other regions accounting for over 36% of the
national labor market (New England, the southeast, the middle west and the
border states).  It is in the 5.0-6.0% range in six other regions
(mid-Atlantic, Florida, the deep south, the oil patch, the southwest and the
Pacific northwest).  It is above 6.0% only in New York (6.6% of the national
labor market) and California (10.6% of the labor market).  <i>As both New York
and California are currently experiencing much stronger output growth than they
were one year ago, it is doubtful that their district presidents would oppose
proposals to tighten monetary policy from low unemployment districts such as
Kansas City, Chicago or Minneapolis.</i><p>
<p>
The major argument against tightening in the face of escalating wages is that
final demand growth will soon moderate and thus lessen the upward pressure on
the economy's resource utilization rates.  <p>
<p>
The growth rate of retail sales slowed during June and July after strong growth
during the spring.  The uptick in mortgage rates should start to cool the
housing market this autumn.  Companies, such as Hewlett Packard, have warned
that there will be a major slowdown in high technology capital spending during
the next twelve months.  The sharp uptick in credit card delinquency rates
could encourage some banks to impose tighter lending quality standards on their
credit card operations.  If low income households suddenly lose access to
cards, they could be forced to curtail their spending.  The inventory
restocking process in the U.S. corporate sector has already produced a large
rebound in the level of imports which will erode the economy's growth momentum
by expanding the trade deficit.<p>

<P>
Most American forecasters now accept that U.S. output growth during
the second quarter will be in the 3.5-4.5% range. The strength
of the May data for employment, production and retail sales has
eliminated any doubts about the economy's capacity to recover
from the inventory adjustment which dampened output growth during
much of 1995 and early 1996. The great controversies now center
on whether output growth can be sustained at a rate of 3.0% or
whether it will fade back to the 1.0-2.0% range which prevailed
during much of 1995.
<P>
The majority of forecasters continue to expect a slowdown because
they perceive the business cycle to be mature, the household sector
to be overleveraged, and the business sector to be losing momentum.
They also believe that the large rise in bond yields since January
will depress home sales and residential construction by the autumn.
The optimists believe that the private sector has far more resilience
and that there will be spurt in federal expenditures as government
agencies rush to spend discretionary funds provided by the recent
Congressional-White House budget agreement.
<P>
<B>The case for above trend U.S. growth during the second half
of 1996 has five major pillars.</B> 
<P>
First, consumer spending should benefit from steady growth of
employment, modest upward pressure on wages, buoyant balance sheets,
and the high level of confidence apparent in the household sector.
According to the early June survey of consumer confidence by the
University of Michigan, households are optimistic about both their
financial situation and the general business outlook. Such optimism
is not surprising in view of the recent revisions in the government's
survey of labor market condition. On the basis of the data which
was available before June 7th, the average monthly increase in
employment had been 116,000 for the past three months, 163,000
for the past six months, and 162,000 for the past twelve months.
<B>The new data has revised up the average monthly growth rate
of employment to 223,000 jobs for the past three months, 225,000
jobs for the past six months, and 195,000 jobs for the past twelve
months.</B> The 1995 employment growth rate also was revised up
to 185,000 jobs per month from 144,000 while 1994 was revised
up to 318,000 from 294,000. The wage data look stronger as well.
The three month and twelve month growth rates of wages are now
3.5% and 3.4% compared to 2.8% and 3.3% previously.
<P>
There are risks in the consumer outlook. Fluctuations in auto
discounts could produce large monthly swings in retail spending
on autos. Rising mortgage rates will probably dampen home sales
by the autumn. The sharp rise now occurring in delinquency rates
on credit card loans could ultimately encourage banks to promote
them less aggressively among low income people. But the strength
of employment growth and the uptrend now occurring in wages suggests
that the underlying growth rate trend of consumer spending will
be at least 2.5% during the next few quarters. While the lending
policies of the credit card sector should be monitored carefully,
the major banks report that the rise in delinquency rates will
not deter them from offering new cards to people earning less
that $30,000 per annum. As the bottom 20% of the U.S. population
accounts for only 5-6% of consumer spending, more careful rationing
of credit card access would also not produce a broad based slump
in consumer spending.
<P>
While the major factor boosting consumer confidence is the improved
labor market, it also should benefit from the recovery occurring
in the advertising industry and the real incomes of financial
journalists. Analysts project that domestic advertising outlays
will rise by 7.4% this year compared to nominal GDP growth of
only 5.0-6.0%. Such a healthy advertising environment will improve
the salaries and expense accounts of the business journalists
who influence household psychology through the tone of the news
stories which they write about the economy. When advertising is
in recession, journalists suffer real income losses which encourage
pessimistic news reporting about the economy. When the advertising
sector is prosperous, the real incomes of journalists improve
and thus reinforces the new mood of optimism about the economy.
<P>
The fluctuation in advertising expenditures during the 1990's
have been so large that they have become an important influence
on both the economy and public policy. Newspaper advertising fell
by 6-7% during 1990 -1991 and grew by only 1.0% during 1992. The
only previous contraction was a 0.2% decline in 1970 which was
followed by 8.1% growth during 1971. Television advertising declined
during 1991 for the first time ever in the post war era while
radio advertising declined for the first time since 1961. <B>Forecasters
do not ordinarily focus on advertising expenditures as a proxy
for consumer confidence but the fact is they are highly interdependent.</B>
If an advertising slump depresses the real incomes of the scribbling
classes, it influences the tone of media commentary about business
conditions and economic policy. <B>There also has been a good
correlation during recent years between newspaper advertising
expenditures and election results.</B> George Bush presided over
the greatest advertising recession of the post-war era. Ronald
Reagan won re-election in 1984 on the back of double digit growth
in advertising outlays. Jimmy Carter's defeat in 1980 coincided
with a collapse in the growth rate of advertising outlays to only
6.0-7.0% from 14-15% during the previous four years. Richard Nixon's
victory in 1972 coincided with a double digit spurt in advertising
outlays after two years of decline and slow growth. The Republicans
lost the White House to the Democrats in 1960 against a backdrop
of advertising expenditures slowing from double digit growth rates
in 1959 to only 4.4% during 1960 and a decline of over 2.0% during
1961. The only electoral contest which has run contrary to the
trend of advertising expenditures is the 1976 presidential election,
when Gerald Ford lost to Jimmy Carter despite an upturn in the
growth rate of advertising expenditures to 16.8% from 4.0-5.0%
during the previous two years.
<P>
The second pillar of the above trend growth scenario is the benign
outlook for business investment. Corporate profits should rise
by 10-12% this year. Capacity utilization rates in the manufacturing
sector have risen back to 82.0% from 81.3% in January while utilization
rates for the economy as a whole are at 83.2%. The ratio of stock
prices to asset replacement costs (Tobin's Q) is at the highest
level in post-war history. As result, <B>the corporate sector
is enjoying an unprecedented fund raising boom in the securities
markets. </B>During the first five months of 1996, there were
364 new equity I.P.O's raising $23.7 billion of capital compared
to 573 I.P.O.'s raising $28.9 billion last year and a previous
peak of 665 I.P.O.'s raising $34 billion during 1993. The market
for non-investment grade debt is also enjoying strong growth.
There were 92 non-investment grade bond offerings worth $17 billion
during the first five months of 1996 compared to 159 worth $28.7
billion last year and a peak of 343 worth $54.4 billion during
1993. <B>The bond market is producing less new financing than
the equity market because bond mutual funds are attracting far
less new money than equity mutual funds but the magnitude of non-investment
grade financing in the debt market is still the greatest since
the Drexel Burnham boom of the mid-1980's.</B> 
<P>
The third pillar of the strong growth scenario is that the economy
has recently experienced its greatest inventory adjustment since
the mid-1980's. Further growth of final demand will now require
faster growth of output. Non-farm inventories contracted at an
annul rate of $0.1 billion during the first quarter compared to
growth of $37.4 billion during 1995 and $46.8 billion during 1994.
In April, retail inventories rebounded at a 0.4% monthly rate
but the economy's inventory/sales ratio was still only 1.38 compared
to a peak of 1.41 during the second half of 1995. In the non-auto
retail sector, the I/S ratio was 1.36 compared to 1.39 during
the third quarter of 1995 while in the general merchandise sector
it was 2.23 compared to 2.33 during the fourth quarter of last
year. The weakness of output during the past year in sectors other
than computers and communications equipment suggests that there
could be a broad based upturn in the level of inventory accumulation
worth at least $30 billion during the second half of 1996.
<P>
The fourth pillar of the strong growth scenario is a resurgence
of discretionary federal spending after several months of fiscal
gridlock and temporary government shutdowns during the first two
quarters of the current fiscal year. Recent CBO studies project
that discretionary federal spending during fiscal 1996 will be
worth bout $535 billion. As a result of the government shutdown,
federal spending during the first seven months of the fiscal year
averaged only $510 billion at annual rates. <B>As a result, federal
agencies will have to spend at an annual rate of $570 billion
during the final five months of the fiscal year if they are to
achieve the CBO target.</B> There is no precise way to convert
such spending into the federal government components of the GDP
accounts but the pressure to spend suggests that real federal
expenditures will rise moderately during the third quarter compared
to widespread forecasts that they will decline at a 3.0-4.0% annual
rate. As a result of the recent congressional-White House disagreements
over fiscal policy, federal spending has been very volatile during
the current fiscal year. It fell at a 12.8% annual rate during
the fourth quarter of 1995 and then rebounded at an 8.5% annual
rate during the first quarter of 1996.
<P>
<B>The final pillar of the strong growth scenario is the upturn
now occurring in other G-7 countries, Latin America and China.</B>
If the U.S. economy can achieve 2.5-3.0% output growth this year,
the world economy should enjoy a growth rate in excess of 4.0%
for the first time since 1988. As the cyclical upturns in other
countries are just getting underway, the odds are high that global
output growth will remain above 4.0% next year as well. The recovery
in the world economy will not prevent an inventory induced upsurge
of imports from widening the U.S. trade deficit this summer but
it should cause improvement of the trade account to boost output
growth by at least 0.2-0.3% during 1997.

<P>
There are few better proxies for measuring economic and political
risk in the former Soviet Union than the interest rate differential
between Estonia and Russia.
<P>
After five years of independence, Estonia has achieved such a
remarkable economic transformation that her nominal short-term
interest rates are about 8% while her real interest rates are
a negative 10%.  In Russia, by contrast, there is so much investor
apprehension about the country's economic policies that nominal
interest rates are over 150% despite the fact that the Ruble has
been stable for nearly a year and inflation has declined to 30%.
<P>
Estonia's economic transformation is remarkable by the standards
of both the former Communist countries to her east and the socialist
Scandinavian economies to her west.  She is a nation of one million
Nordic people and one half million displaced Russians trying to
create a new Hong Kong on the edge of the old Soviet Union.  Her
policies are so unambiguously market oriented that she could soon
have the most open economy and smallest government sector of any
country on the European continent.
<P>
Estonia has no tariffs, no government deficit, no central government
debt, a flat rate income tax of 26% and a government expenditure
share of GDP equal to 27% or less than one half of the west European
average.  She also conducts her monetary policy through a currency
board which has made the Kroon convertible into the D-mark at
a fixed rate of eight to one.  As with the currency board regimes
in Hong Kong and Argentina, the expansion of Estonia's money supply
now depends upon the growth of foreign exchange reserves, not
just domestic economic conditions.  Since foreign investment in
Estonia has been expanding steadily, Estonian interest rates have
declined to negative levels despite the fact that she is running
a current account deficit equal to about 6% of GDP.  Foreign direct
investment as a share of GDP already exceeds 10%, a level which
is close to the record set by Singapore.
<P>
In the initial years after independence and the dismantling of
communism, official measures of Estonian economic output contracted
by over 40%.  But the output losses resulted from people reallocating
resources from sectors producing goods which no one wanted to
buy to sectors which reflected the economy's new openness.  In
the last year of the Soviet era, 62% of Estonia's output derived
from manufacturing, 17% from agriculture and 12% from services.
 Today, the service sector accounts for almost two thirds of GDP
while the manufacturing share has fallen to less than 25%.  As
a result of the speed of this restructuring, the economy is now
expanding at a 6% annual rate and unemployment is only 5.0%.
<P>
Estonia has enjoyed some unique advantages in creating a dynamic
service sector.  She is very close to Finland (one hour by hydrofoil)
and was able to attract nearly three million Finnish tourists
last year.  They come to see the medieval center of the capital,
Tallinn, as well as to shop for goods which sell at a discount
to prices in Helsinki.  While the two countries have always been
separate, their languages are very similar and Finnish companies
have been the largest foreign investors in Estonia.
<P>
The other great opportunity for Estonia's service sector is the
development of Tallinn as a major trans-shipment point for Russia
and other countries in the region.  Tallinn has one of the best
harbors on the Baltic Sea and could easily become a more important
port than St. Petersburg.  But Tallinn's future role could be
inhibited by the poor relations which exist between Russia and
Estonia.  In a recent poll of Russian popular attitudes about
which country is most hostile to Russia, the winner was Estonia.
 The Estonian ambassador to Moscow said the poll resultwas great
honor for such a small country, but the deep animosities lingering
from the Soviet era are a potential obstacle to Estonia achieving
its full potential as a new Hong Kong for the region.  Estonia
is such a small country that foreign companies will want to invest
there only if the country can serve as a warehouse and distributioncenter
for the whole Baltic region and eastern Russia, not just the local
market. The Estonians have much to learn from the Poles, who have
developed such successful relations with their former enemies
in both the east and west that exports are growing at a 35% annual
rate while cross border retail trade is worth over 5% of GDP.
 Estonia also has such a small population that her own industries
will someday need access to Russian labor in order to expand.
 If barriers to trade and capital can be removed, northeast Russia
could emerge as a low cost labor reserve for Estonia in much the
same way that the southern Chinese province of Guandong does for
Hong Kong.
<P>
Estonia is still in the midst of privatizing former state enterprises
and establishing the legal infrastructure of capitalism.  But
her greatest economic policy challenge during the next few years
will probably be managing the financial side-effects of the currency
board monetary regime on credit expansion and asset prices. Estonia's
Kroon was the first new currency to emerge from the former Soviet
Union and it was pegged at such a deeply undervalued level that
the exchange rate link to the D-mark has not undermined the country's
commercial competitiveness despite the large inflation differential
with Germany.  The only powerful protectionist lobby in Estonia
is the agricultural sector, which has been suffering from high
tariffs in both Russia and the European Union.  But with real
interest rates at minus 10% and the economy enjoying strong growth,
there is a risk that Estonia's currency board could encourage
speculative bank lending and a sharp rise in asset prices.  Under
a currency board monetary system, the sole goal of monetary policy
is to maintain a convertible currency at a fixed exchange rate.
 The central bank cannot manipulate interest rates in order to
fine tune the economy.  At present, both domestic and international
investors are very happy to purchase Kroon financial assets with
negative real interest rates because Estonian interest rates are
several hundred basis points above the yields available on D-mark
financial assets. The risk is that negative real interest rates
in an environment of high economic growth will encourage a burst
of speculative bank lending to finance inflation in real estate
prices and equity values.  The central bank will have to carefully
monitor credit quality in the banking system in order to prevent
a boom and bust cycle from occurring.  Estonia had a major banking
crisis in 1992 but that crisis resulted from loans to bankrupt
Soviet era state enterprises.  Today, the Estonian banking system
is so well capitalized that the some of its institutions are taking
advantage of Latvia's banking problems by expanding into that
country.
<P>
While Estonia's rate of economic growth is one of the highest
in the world, her standard of living is still suffering from the
lagged effects of fifty years of communism.  Before World War
Two, Estonia had a per capita income comparable to Finland's.
 Today, her per capita income is about $3,000 while Finland's
is $18.850.  If we adjust for price differences, the per capita
income of Estonia on a purchasing power parity basis is probably
over $6,000, but it is still far below its long term potential.
<P>
Estonia is such a small country that many pundits will probably
dismiss her success as the by-product of unique historical and
geo-political circumstances.  Despite a long period of Russian
domination by both the Czars and the Communists, Estonia's cultural
roots are in Scandinavia.  She was a member of the Hanseatic league
during the early middle ages and a province of the Swedish empire
until the 18th century.  Before 1939, her economy had consisted
of small farms and a wealthy class of German merchant families
who had emigrated to Tallinn during the Hanseatic era.  But the
fact remains that Estonia is creating such a dynamic free market
economy that she will soon appear to be an anomaly compared to
all of the countries of the Baltic, not just former Republics
of the Soviet Union.
<P>
When Mrs. Thatcher named her first cabinet in 1979, it had so
many people of eastern European descent that one media pundit
said it was unique for containing more Estonians than Etonians.
 In the early Thatcher years, Estonia was still a Soviet satellite
and no one could have imagined her serving as a role model for
any form of free market economic experiment.  But if Estonia can
manage the potential monetary risks in her Hong Kong style economic
policy mix, there is little doubt that she will emerge as an important
case study of the benefits of currency boards, free trade, and
low income tax rates for all developing countries and even her
Scandinavian neighbors.  Estonia's monetary system could also
serve as a useful tool for improving relations with Russia.  As
Mr. Yeltsin tries to re-establish the credibility of his economic
reform program, he could do no worse than to announce that the
Russian central bank will attempt to improve its anti-inflation
credibility by pegging the Ruble to the Estonian Kroon.

<P>
As a result of the strength of final demand and rundown of inventories
which occurred during the first quarter, the majority of American
forecasters will soon be projecting 3.0-4.0% output growth during
the second quarter.  The great unresolved question which still
hangs over the financial markets is whether final demand will
slacken again and cause output growth to dip back into the 1.0-2.0%
range during the third quarter or whether output growth will remain
in the 3.0-3.5% range as a result of robust capital investment,
steady expansion of retail sales and a burst of discretionary
federal spending during the closing months of the 1996 fiscal
year.  <B>The economy's performance during the third quarter will
be of critical importance to investor psychology this summer because
it will probably determine whether the Federal Reserve decides
to hike short-term interest rates.</B>  The Fed can avoid tightening
in response to one strong quarter because output growth has been
weak or erratic for over a year.  But with the unemployment rate
at 5.4%, inflation already under upward pressure because of  oil
and food price shocks, and the stock market seemingly oblivious
to all risks, it will be difficult to avoid at least one modest
monetary tightening  at either the early July or late August FOMC
meeting.
<P>
The American forecasting community expects the second quarter
to represent the growth peak of 1996 but there is no consensus
about the growth rate for the second half.  Pessimists believe
that the economy will loose growth momentum quickly because of
the adverse effect of higher oil and food prices on consumer real
income, the impact of rising bond yields on demand for housing
and a general slowdown in business fixed investment after two
years of robust gains.  There will probably also be a sharp rise
of imports and deterioration of the trade account because of inventory
restocking in many tradable goods sectors.
<P>
The growth optimists accept that retail spending will slow and
that the trade deficit will widen but they still project output
growth to remain in excess of 3.0% because of robust business
investment, steady growth of residential construction, a large
swing in corporate demand for inventories and a rebound in government
expenditures as federal agencies rush to spend unexpected appropriations
provided by the budget compromise announced a few weeks ago. 
Under the new budget, federal agencies will be able to engage
in $291 billion of discretionary spending during the April to
September period compared to $244 billion during the first half
of the current fiscal year.
<P>
<B>Several recent economic data reports have strengthened the
arguments of the optimists.</B>  The latest Manpower Employment
Survey is projecting a moderate uptick of employment growth during
the second quarter and is optimistic about the third quarter as
well.  In April, non-defense capital goods orders excluding aircraft
enjoyed their strongest growth rate in several months.  The recent
decline in oil prices suggests that consumer inflation will ease
during the summer while the year on year growth rate of the CPI
has run so far ahead of the consumption deflator that real household
income is not as weak as the CPI may suggest.  The resilience
of the stock market continues to boost household wealth and is
having positive spillover effects on sectors of the economy sensitive
to discretionary spending.  The government also appears to have
enjoyed a surprisingly large windfall in capital gains tax receipts
during April while America's charities report that personal contributions
to them rose by 11% last year or the highest growth rate since
1986.  Nor is the stock market boom just increasing household
wealth.  <B>It also is boosting investment and job creation by
increasing the flow of capital to entrepreneurial firms through
initial public offerings.  In the first half of 1996, IPO activity
appears likely to expand at a $60 billion annual rate compared
to $29.7 billion last year and a previous peak of $41.7 billion
during 1993.</B>
<P>
Despite the allegations of many economic commentators that Federal
Reserve policy is restrictive, the growth of IPO activity as well
as bank lending to small and medium sized companies makes it clear
that the overall financial environment is quite stimulative. 
Commercial banks enjoy strong balance sheets and are competing
to make new loans.  The mutual fund boom is encouraging an upsurge
in securitized capital formation through new stock and bond issues.
 Investors are more willing to assume risks because they have
enjoyed healthy capital gains on their existing equity portfolios.
 <B>In fact, the ratio of stock market capitalization to GDP has
itself expanded to 90.4% or the highest level ever recorded in
American history.</B>  The previous all time peak was 81% in 1929
and the post-war peak was 78% in 1972.  As a result of healthy
profit growth in the corporate sector since 1991, the stock market's
p/e multiple is still at moderate levels (16 using 1996 profits)
but the ratios of price to book value and price to replacement
cost (Tobin's Q) have risen to record levels.  Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan has downplayed the significance of these
ratios by stressing that book value cannot adequately measure
the impact of America's investment in technology and human capital
on potential corporate earnings power  but the fact remains that
firms are enjoying such rich valuation ratios that they have a
very strong incentive to boost investment.  <B>As a result, it
is not surprising that the most distinguishing feature of the
current business cycle has been its supply side dimension.</B>
 The economy enjoyed a healthy recovery after 1993 because of
an upsurge of capital investment which is causing the economy's
potential manufacturing capacity to expand at a 4.5% annual rate
compared to 2.0-2.5% in the early 1990's.  A recovery with such
strong investment leadership enjoys self-reinforcing momentum
because it boosts the economy's potential growth rate and thus
lowers the risk of inflation even as demand increases. The problem
for policy-makers is that official output data does not yet show
any productivity pay-off from the recent investment boom, so they
continue to perceive the economy's optimal growth rate to be only
about 2.0-2.5%.
<P>
There is not yet a consensus at the Federal Reserve on the need
to tighten monetary policy, but opinion will move in that direction
if May and June data confirm that final demand is expanding at
a steady rate and that the manufacturing sector is shifting from
a sub-cycle of inventory liquidation to accumulation.  Excluding
food and oil, the economy's inflation performance is still excellent
but if output growth remains above 3.0% through year end, the
unemployment rate will drop to 5.0% and provoke increasing anxiety
about the danger of increased pressure on wages and prices.  The
risk of tightening will fade only if there is such pronounced
weakness in retail sales that the FOMC can ignore the resilience
of other sectors or if there is a sudden precipitous correction
in equity prices.
<P>
Political factors could delay any new Fed tightening until August.
 The Senate has not yet been able to confirm the reappointment
of Alan Greenspan as Fed Chairman or the appointment of two new
Governors because of a filibuster by Senator Harkin of Iowa. 
The two new appointees may also be reluctant to launch their Fed
careers by tightening immediately.  But if third quarter growth
forecasts solidify in the 3.0-3.5% range, there will be at least
a 75% chance of monetary tightening at the August FOMC meeting.
<P>
<B>The other factor which could encourage U.S. monetary tightening
and depress bond markets this summer is the growing confidence
among forecasters that 1997 will be the most robust year for the
world economy since 1988.</B>  According to the latest IMF forecast,
world output should expand by 4.3% during 1998 compared to 3.8%
this year, 3.5% during 1995, and 1.5-2.4% during the early 1990's.
 As a result of its below consensus forecast of only 1.8% and
2.2% U.S. output growth during 1996 and 1997, the IMF is projecting
just 2.0% and 2.6% output growth in all the industrial countries
during this year and next year, but it expects output growth in
the developing countries to rise to 6.4% from 6.3% during 1995
and 5.9% during 1995.  The countries in transition from communism
also should enjoy growth rates of 2.5% and 3.8% during 1995 and
1996 compared to large output losses during the early 1990's.
  As the IMF is significantly undersestimating U.S. output growth,
the world economy should enjoy a growth rate in excess of 4.0%
this year and over 4.5% next year.
<P>
Most Wall Street people still view the world economy largely from
the perspective of the G-7 countries but the fact is they now
account for only about 55% of world output compared to 40% for
the developing countries and 5% for the transition economies.
 As a result of the high growth differentials between the developing
countries and industrial countries, the  G-7 share of world output
will decline steadily during the next decade.  The fact is the
developing countries have about 70% of the world's land area and
85% of its population compared to 45% of its output and 15% of
its stock market capitalization.  The gaps between human resources
and output should decline significantly as the developing countries
continue their transition to market oriented economic systems.

The major risk now confronting the U.S. financial markets is that bond yields will rise sharply in response to both evidence of economic recovery and the increasingly populist tone of the 1996 election campaign.  <B>Most forecasters have clearly underestimated the U.S. economy's resilience while congressional Republicans are so alarmed about their low standing in the opinion polls that they have decided to counter-attack by proposing an immediate reduction in the gasoline tax</B>.  If the bidding war in Washington continues to escalate, investors will become concerned about expansion of the federal deficit and enactment of new regulatory entitlements, such as a higher minimum wage, at a time when the demand for labor is already starting to encourage faster wage growth.
<P>

The overall cyclical condition of the U.S. economy is the best since the 1960's, but there is widespread dissatisfaction with perceived changes in the composition of national income.  The profit share of GDP is still well below its peak in the 1950's and 1960's, but  many people believe that the post-1991 economic expansion has benefited only a small elite of senior executives and stockholders, not the great mass of the American people.  As a result the U.S. economy will be caught between two colliding forces this summer; a bond market which distrusts output growth in excess of 2.0% and a bidding competition in Washington to redistribute income at the expense of corporate profits and the federal deficit.
<P>

Since perceptions are reality in both the bond market and politics, bond investors must now confront a perplexing dilemma.  
<P>

If they start to discount a robust economy and Democratic takeover of  the Congress, bond yields will rise so sharply that the economy could stall this autumn and help set the stage for a Dole victory.  In such a scenario, bond yields could drop from 8.0% this summer back to 5.5% next year.  If, by contrast, bond yields peak close to 7.0% or soon decline, the economy will lose momentum only gradually and the odds of  Democratic victories in November will improve.  If the Democrats regain control of the Congress, bond yields will remain in the 6.5-7.5% range in late 1996 even if output growth slows to 1.5-2.0%.
<P>

Election campaigns always encourage politicians to make promises about the economy which they regret later, <B>but the stakes in the 1996 election are unprecedented in the modern era</B>.  No Democratic President has won two consecutive election victories since Franklin Roosevelt.  The Republicans have not controlled the Congress for two consecutive terms, since the days of Calvin Coolidge and Herbert Hoover.  As a result, both parties perceive great opportunities and risks in the current election.  The President has done a masterful job of borrowing much of the Republican rhetoric about reducing the size of government while playing upon the theme of economic insecurity through populist proposals, such as boosting the minimum wage.  As is apparent with his stands on Tort Reform and the balanced budget, <B>he is remarkably adept at shifting between the imagery of a New Democrat and an Old Democrat on an issue-by-issue basis</B>.  In fact, a recent media search by The New York Times found that President Clinton did not refer to the minimum wage once when his party controlled the Congress, but he has endorsed a minimum wage hike nearly fifty times since the Republicans took over the Congress in early 1995.
<P>

The minimum wage has fallen so sharply in real terms since the 1980's that an increase will pose only modest risks for employment creation, but the markets regard it as a bad omen of the policies which could follow in 1997 if the Democrats win back control of the Congress.  As a result, it is not surprising that Dr. Al Wojinlower refers to the current American economic scene as one of "glum prosperity".
<P>

The U.S. economy expanded at a 2.8% annual rate during the first quarter compared to wide-spread expectations that output growth would be only 1.5-2.0%.  Domestic final sales rose at a 4.1% annual rate compared to 0.6% during the fourth quarter of 1995, 2.6% during the third quarter, and 2.2% during the second quarter.  The uptick in domestic final sales was led by a 14.5% growth rate in business spending on new equipment, 5.8% growth in business spending on structures, and 3.5% growth in consumer spending.  After falling steadily for several quarters, federal government spending also rebounded at a 6.7% annual rate compared to a 12.8% decline during the fourth quarter.  As a result of auto inventory liquidation, non-farm business inventories grew at only a $12.8 billion annual rate compared to $19.5 billion during the fourth quarter of 1995, $36 billion during the middle quarters of 1995, and $54.5 billion during the first quarter of 1995.  If we exclude autos, though, real business inventories rose at a $36.9 billion annual rate last quarter compared to $19.1 billion during the fourth quarter of 1995 and $44.5 billion during the third quarter.
<P>

<B>The underlying strength of domestic final demand suggests that the economy should continue to expand at a 3.0-3.5% annual rate through the middle quarters of 1996</B>.  There will be renewed weakness in federal spending during the second quarter and inventory rebuilding will boost the trade deficit, but steady growth of private final demand, coupled with a swing in the corporate inventory cycle, should still produce output growth in excess of 3.0%.
<P>

The best confirmation that the inventory cycle has turned is the purchasing agent index.  It rose back over 50 in April, or its highest level since June, 1995, in response to stronger orders, output, and backlogs.  The April employment report was weak after hefty job gains during the first quarter, but some of this weakness appears to reflect seasonal problems with the timing of the survey.  The April Conference Board survey of consumer perceptions of the job market was much more upbeat.  Only 21.3% of households reported that jobs were hard to get compared to 26.5% during March and 23.4% during February.
<P>

<B>The economy's surprising resilience during the first quarter has already provoked a new debate about when the Fed might feel compelled to tighten monetary policy again</B>.  It is doubtful that the Fed will want to move as early as its late May meeting, but some analysts are now speculating about a rate hike in July or one year after the Fed first began easing policy in response to the 1995 slowdown.
<P>

There is no consensus at the Fed about when to act because there are as many divisions about the economic outlook on the FOMC as there are in the private sector.  Some governors perceive that the economy is structurally vulnerable to weakness because of the high level of consumer debt, while the majority perceive that the economy is expanding at a moderate non-inflationary rate.  They will not want to tighten until they see clear signs that output growth will remain above 2.5% on a sustained basis and push utilization rates to levels which might encourage higher inflation.
<P>

The evidence on the inflation outlook itself is mixed.  There have been large price increases for food and fuel during recent weeks because of exogenous shocks, such as poor weather and low inventories.  Such price shocks are occurring independently of the global business cycle, but they could alter the inflation outlook if they began to influence corporate price and wage behavior.
<P>

Traditional cyclical measures of inflation pressure, such as the purchasing agent price index, are still subdued, but if the output growth remains close to 3.0% they are bound to revive in the near future.  The first quarter employment cost index report also contained the first hints of wage escalation in the U.S. economy.  Wages and salaries in the private sector rose at a 3.3% annual rate compared to gains of only 2.8-2.9% during the previous four quarters.  The uptick in wages was partly offset by slower growth of benefits after a long period in which benefit costs exceeded wage gains.  <B>But with the unemployment rate at 5.4%, the risk is high that wages will continue to escalate because of business competition for labor</B>.
<P>

As a result of  the low level of surplus capacity in the U.S. economy, there is clearly a case for monetary tightening as early as the July FOMC meeting, but there will not be a consensus on the FOMC for action without evidence that output growth will be sustained at a level above 2.5% and that industrial commodity prices are rising.  If the purchasing agent price index shoots up to 50% or higher during the next two months, and the Blue Chip Survey of the economic consensus projects a new median forecast of 3.0-3.5% output growth through the second half, the Fed is virtually certain to hike money market yields 25 basis points in July.  But if the purchasing agent price index is still in the 40-45 range and forecasters remain ambiguous about the growth outlook, the Fed could defer a decision until later in the summer.

<P>



  The performance of the U.S. financial markets during the next few quarters will be driven by the interaction between business cycle developments and the unfolding of  the 1996 election campaign. Monetary policy will be expansionary in most G-7 countries, but bond yields could fluctuate in a wide range because of changing investor perception of political and economic risk.  

<P>

  The large rise in U.S. bond yields since January suggests the market already is discounting several developments, including a moderate upturn in the economy, no further progress in resolving the fiscal deadlock in Washington, and a high probability of President Clinton winning re-election. European bond yields have risen partly in response to U.S. developments and partly because of investor apprehension about how the governments of Germany and France will resolve the contradictions in their program for European monetary union. Japanese bond yields have risen because of continuing evidence that the Japanese economy has bottomed as well as investor concern about the cost of future bank bail-outs on the government's fiscal deficit.  

<P>

  The uptick in bond yields during February and March was so sudden that some pundits began to make comparisons with the bond market collapse of 1994, but <B>it is doubtful that the cyclical revival in the U.S. economy this spring and summer will be as robust as the upturn which pushed U.S. bond yields over 8.0% two years ago.</B> In 1994, the economy enjoyed a spurt to 3.5% output growth from 2.2% because of 3.0% growth in personal consumption, 9.2% growth in business fixed investment and an inventory swing worth 0.6% of GDP. In 1996, the economy will probably enjoy 2.4% growth in consumer spending, 5.0-6.0% growth in business investment, and a stabilization of corporate inventories. But while output growth for the year as a whole will probably average only 2.5%, there could be a spurt to growth rates as high as 3.0- 3.5% during the second and third quarter, as the manufacturing sector shifts from inventory liquidation to inventory accumulation.  

<P>

  The 1994 rebound in the economy produced a large rise in capacity utilization rates and industrial commodity prices, so the Federal Reserve hiked U.S. short-term interest rates from 3.0% to 6.0%. If the coming rebound in output stabilizes with growth rates of 2.0-2.5% after one or two moderately stronger quarters, it will not have as dramatic an impact on commodity prices as the 1994 upturn. Capacity utilization rates have dropped back to 82.0% from 85.0% last year while new capacity is expanding at a 4.0% annual rate compared to only 2.0-2.5% during the early 1990's. There is a risk that the low level of unemployment will encourage some escalation of wage growth but the flexibility of the U.S. labor market will probably cause changes in wage compensation to occur gradually. <B>Unemployment has been at 4.0% in several mid-western states since 1994 and firms have still been successful at restraining costs.</B> In 1996, productivity also should improve as output growth recovers.  

<P>

  It is possible that the coming turn in the inventory cycle could produce such large income gains that consumer spending will rise sharply rather than moderately, but several factors suggest that the economy does not have the pent-up demand which existed after three years of sluggish growth between 1991 and 1994. The ratio of consumer debt to income has risen sharply and consumer delinquency rates on credit cards are back at the highs of 1990. While the delinquency rate on the total stock of consumer debt remains very subdued, <B>the uptick in the delinquency rate on cards could encourage some consumer finance companies to impose tighter credit standards after a prolonged period in which lending conditions became progressively easier.</B> As Federal Reserve Governor Larry Lindsey has warned, such a change in the credit environment could reduce the spending power of lower middle class households who lack discretionary income. The potentially new positive factor for consumer spending is the huge wealth gains which the household sector has enjoyed from the appreciation of equity prices. The capitalization of the U.S.- equity market has risen to $6.7 trillion or 87.5% of GDP compared to a seventy year average of 48% of GDP. Households own about two-thirds of all U.S. corporate equity, with one-third held in the form of mutual funds, IRA's, or defined benefit pension plans and two-thirds owned directly. Econometric research shows only a weak link between aggregate consumer spending and stock market gains because about 90% of U.S. corporate equity is owned by less than 5% of the households. But the capital gains of the past year have been so large that they should encourage healthy growth of demand for upmarket consumer goods as well as stronger retail spending in states with large concentrations of retired people, such as Florida. In 1992, households over the age of 65 owned 41.4% of publicly traded U.S. corporate equity despite the fact that they account for only 21.8% of all households. Households in the 45-54 year range, by contrast, own 18.07% of all U.S. equity and account for 16.42% of the population. It is popular in the investment community to describe senior citizens as people living on fixed incomes, but the spectacular performance of the stock market compared to real wages during recent years suggests that this label is misapplied. In the 1990's, it is people in their 20's and 30's, not the elderly, who are living on fixed incomes.  

<P>

  <B>If the rebound in the economy this spring does not push the purchasing agent index for inflation and other sensitive measures of industrial prices sharply higher, the Federal Reserve will probably permit short-term interest rates to remain at current levels through the summer and autumn.</B> It might decide to tighten in late 1996 if stronger growth in the world economy threatens to give a significant boost to commodity prices but the recovery in Europe and Japan is so weak that it will probably not generate major pressure on commodity prices until 1997. In contrast to U.S. industry, the European corporate sector has not yet reduced inventories significantly while final sales remain weak. Japan enjoyed healthy growth of final sales during the final quarter of 1995, but inventory levels are high and the government has not yet completed enactment of a rescue program for the banks. Large tax hikes are also scheduled for 1997. It should be noted as well that the bank rescue program now before the Japanese Diet is focused solely on the 8 trillion yen of bad debt in the Jusen. There are numerous other non-bank financial intermediaries with problem loans approaching 40 trillion yen.

<B>A Memo from David Hale</B>	
<P>

A preliminary version of the coming White House report on social security reform is available by calling Debbie Hamilton at 312-499-1760.  It contains proposals for radical changes in the investment policies of the social security system.  Among the alternatives mentioned are investing social security funds directly in the equity market or turning over the assets for deployment in individually controlled retirement accounts.  There was no consensus in the study group taskforce about how to proceed, so this report will not lead to any immediate legislative proposals.  But after the 1996 elections there could be significant changes in the social security system's investment policies with potentially benign consequences for the mutual fund industry.

<P>

The yield on long-term U.S. Treasury bonds has increased by nearly 40 basis points since early January despite Fed easing and continued evidence of sluggish economic growth in the United States. <B>The steepening of the yield curve reflects a variety of economic and political developments.</B> Retailers have reported a stronger tone to consumer spending since January and thus the risk of the fourth quarter slowdown evolving into a recession has been greatly reduced. The weakness of Senator Robert Dole in the early primaries has lowered the odds of any new breakthrough in the budget talks in Washington while the success of Patrick Buchanan has provoked new anxieties about the ability of the Republicans to retain their congressional majorities in this autumn's election. The yen has rallied sharply because of Japanese corporations repatriating capital at the end of the March fiscal year and increasing evidence that the Japanese economy has stabilized. While the European economy is clearly weak, German investors are demanding increased yield premiums to compensate for the risk that Chancellor Kohl and President Chirac will pursue monetary union despite the failure of both countries to achieve the Maastricht targets for reduction of their government deficits. <B>The only clearly positive news for the bond market during the past week was the decision of President Clinton to re-appoint Alan Greenspan as Fed Chairman as well as to fill the existing vacancies with competent and credible economists widely perceived to have mainstream views about the role of the Federal Reserve in economic policy.</B>
<P>



The failure of the White House and Congress to agree on a fiscal package has been a major disappointment to investors because in the autumn of 1995 there appeared to be an unprecedented opportunity for long-term deficit reduction through cuts in Medicare entitlement programs. If the Republicans retain control of Congress, there will be a second opportunity to pursue some form of deficit reduction in 1997 but forecasts about next year's fiscal policy are speculative at best. The most popular Republican presidential candidates so far have been Steve Forbes and Patrick Buchanan, neither of whom has stressed balancing the budget as a policy priority. Ironically, if they force the Republican Party to adopt a more populist fiscal policy of tax cuts and increased federal spending to promote job security, President Clinton could emerge as the champion of fiscal conservatism this autumn. <B>The primary consolation for the bond market from this year's budget gridlock is that the Republicans will probably be able to impose $10-15 billion of targeted spending cuts in the continuing resolutions still moving through Congress and thus lower the fiscal 1996 deficit to $120-130 billion.</B>
<P>



While investors have long been apprehensive about the ability of a man as old as Senator Robert Dole to be an effective presidential candidate, the fragmentation of the Republican Party in the early primary elections has still come as a shock to the financial markets. It creates several potential risks. First, the Republican Party could become so badly divided that it will lose control of the Congress this autumn, not just the opportunity to regain the White House. Secondly, the issue of deficit reduction has faded completely from the political debate because of the popularity of Steve Forbes and Patrick Buchanan. Forbes is running on Reaganite themes, such as cutting taxes, while Buchanan is campaigning against free trade and an unregulated labor market. The candidate most closely identified with the Congressional Contract with America, Senator Phil Gramm, was the first to drop out. Thirdly, investors are apprehensive that Buchanan's successes will encourage other candidates to move in a populist direction by advocating more restrictive trade policies or large increases in marginal income tax rates to punish highly paid executives responsible for job shedding at large corporations. Senator Robert Dole has some advisors sympathetic to Buchanan's positions on trade and they have already encouraged him to make speeches attacking the American corporate sector. <B>If the Democrats were to regain control of the House, Rep. Richard Gephardt would become the House speaker and probably use his new position to develop a Democratic version of the Buchanan agenda for his own presidential campaign in 2000.</B>
<P>



Patrick Buchanan is such a divisive candidate that it will be impossible for him to win the Republican nomination, but his primary victories are exposing the social contradictions in America's recent economic performance and thus provoking a debate about income distribution, corporate responsibility, and other issues which the Republicans are often uncomfortable discussing.
<P>



<B>The U.S. economy has significantly out-performed all other industrial countries in job creation since the 1970's.</B> During the past sixteen years, the U.S. economy has created 28 million new jobs and reduced its unemployment rate to 5.7% while the unemployment rate in many European countries is twice as high. The ratio of long-term unemployed (unemployed longer than one year) to total unemployment is also only 12% in the U.S. compared to 40% in Germany and 35% in France. During the half century since the end of the Second World War, the U.S. economy has produced an expansion of private affluence on a scale unprecented since the industrial revolution began. In 1950, fewer than one million Americans earned as much as $60,000 in today's money. By 1967, slightly more than one million Americans had incomes of $100,000 per annum on the basis of 1993 constant dollars. Despite the volatile business cycles of the 1970's and early 1980's, this number expanded to 2.7 million by 1980 and to 5.6 million by 1993. In fact, over one million Americans had incomes above $200,000 per annum by 1993. <B>But the price of this flexibility has been an increase in job insecurity and erosion in the real wages of less skilled workers since the 1970's.</B> 
<P>



The U.S. economy has out-performed all other industrial countries in job creation during recent years because it enjoys far more price and regulatory flexibility in its labor market than other countries. Almost 20 million Americans change their job every year and even during the recession of the early 1990's only about 3 million did so because of employment termination. American firms are far more willing to hire than European firms because the cost of layoffs is much lower than in Europe.
<P>



According to a recent research report from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, the duration of jobs for most categories of American workers has been remarkably stable since 1973. But there has been a major increase in the rate of permanent dismissals at companies compared to temporary layoffs. In the 1960's, permanent dismissals accounted for only about 30-35% of new unemployment compared to 40-45% in 1993. The share of temporary layoffs, by contrast, has declined from just over 20% to about 17%.
<P>



<B>Job insecurity has been an especially striking feature of employment at the large Fortune 500 companies which were once considered to be the country's most stable employers.</B> Since 1979, their total employment has declined from 16.5 million jobs to 11.5 million jobs, with most of the job losses occurring in the U.S. itself. The growth of small and medium sized firms has provided many alternative forms of employment but some workers have had to accept lower pay when making such transitions. Start-up firms have much higher failure rates than old established companies and thus contribute to the sense of insecurity among people leaving job at large firms.
<P>



Patrick Buchanan alleges that U.S. firms have been transferring jobs to foreign countries in pursuit of lower wages but employment data for U.S. multinationals suggests that the technological factors which have forced cuts in U.S. manufacturing employment have been operative in other countries as well. <B>Between 1979 and 1989, American firms reduced their employment of foreign production workers by 2.3 million jobs while creating 1.2 million new jobs in non-production departments, such as marketing and distribution.</B> The expansion of U.S. companies in foreign markets is making them more formidable global competitors and thus boosting U.S. exports. It is not merely transferring jobs between countries on a zero sum basis.
<P>



<B>The introduction of new and more sophisticated forms of technology into the workplace has also produced greater income inequality based on education.</B> Since 1979, the real wages of high school graduates have fallen by 21% while the earnings of people with advanced technical degrees have often increased significantly. Firms also have tried to help their employers avoid high effective marginal tax rates by expanding benefits more aggressively than wage and salary income. During the past fifteen years, the government's employment cost index has increased by about 22.0% in real terms while real average hourly earnings have fallen by 8%. The biggest gains in employment costs were concentrated in benefits (up 38% in real terms), not take-home pay. Benefits have expanded from 16% of compensation in the early 1980's to over 18.0% today. As a result, workers which are employed by small firms without non-taxable benefit packages have suffered a much greater erosion of real income than people employed by firms with health care, pensions, and other non-taxable forms of compensation.

<P>

The U.S. dollar has eased against both the Japanese yen and German mark since January because of a mixture of economic and political factors.
<P>

<B>First, there are signs that the U.S. investors are exporting capital aggressively again.</B> In January, retail investors purchased almost $8 billion of international funds or the highest level since early 1994. If these trends were to be sustained, total capital outflows from the U.S. during 1996 could rise to $150-200 billion at annual rates. During 1995, U.S. investors purchased foreign equities at a rate of $4.1 billion during the first quarter, $10.2 billion during the second quarter, and $21.5 billion during the third quarter compared to $47 billion during 1994 and $63 billion during 1993. American demand for foreign bonds also has been expanding. In 1995, U.S. investors purchased foreign bonds at a rate of $3.8 billion during the first quarter, $12.7 billion during the second quarter and $13.8 billion during the third quarter. Pension capital outflows have been steady at about $35 billion per annum during recent years but retail investment demand for foreign securities has fluctuated in a wide range.
<P>

In 1995, the growing U.S. demand for foreign securities was offset by foreign purchases of American securities by both private and official investors. Foreign investors bought U.S. equities at a rate of $5.8 billion during the second quarter and $5.2 billion during the third quarter after selling $3.5 billion during the first quarter. Foreign investors were much more enthusiastic buyers of U.S. Treasury bonds last year. Their purchases were $32.9 billion during the first quarter, $43.5 billion during the second quarter, and $46.9 billion during the third quarter. A large share of these purchases were probably official intervention to support the dollar. Japan, for example, purchased $31.4 billion of U.S. government securities during the first three quarters of 1995 despite a cautious attitude towards the dollar by Tokyo's big life insurance companies. But the U.S. bond market rally also attracted many foreign buyers to corporate bonds, not just government securities. Foreign purchases of U.S. corporate bonds were $14.4 billion during the first quarter, $13.1 billion during the second quarter, and $13.2 billion during the third quarter. The problem for the U.S. capital account during 1996 is that American equity values are high relative to the rest of the world while the U.S. bond market is unlikely to produce returns as attractive as those which occurred during 1995. <B>There is also far more human and organizational infrastructure on Wall Street promoting foreign investment than ever before in American history.</B> The U.S. now has 367 international equity funds compared to 196 in 1993, 95 in 1990, and only 13 in 1984. The number of global equity funds has also expanded to 167 from 99 in 1992 and 16 in 1984. While global bond funds have attracted less money than international equity funds, their number also has expanded to 145 from 87 in 1992 and only 1 in 1984. As a result of the growth of America's international fund management industry and the significant out-performance of Wall Street compared to many foreign markets during recent years, American demand for foreign securities during 1996 could be much higher than foreign private demand for U.S. securities.
<P>

The second factor which has depressed the dollar during recent weeks has been seasonal repatriation of capital to Japan and investor concerns about the Bank of Japan shifting away from its easy monetary policy. The new finance minister recently stated that the yields on pensioners' bank deposits were excessively low. New data for industrial production and retail sales also suggest that the Japanese economy has bottomed and begun to recover. As a result of these developments, the futures market is now suggesting that the Bank of Japan could raise short-term interest rates this summer despite the severe asset quality problems of many Japanese banks. The slump in interest rates futures and rally in the yen has become self-reinforcing during recent weeks by encouraging many foreign borrowers of yen, such as hedge funds, to reduce their yen liabilities. As a result, the Bank of Japan has intervened on a large scale during recent weeks in order to persuade investors that they will not permit the seasonal pressures for a stronger yen to go too far.
<P>

<B>As a result of the problems of the Japanese banking system, it is very doubtful that there will be any new monetary tightening in the near future but the yen could still hold in a trading range of 103 to 107 because of political factors, not just divergences in monetary cycles and business conditions.</B> In January, U.S. manufacturing firms began to complain about dollar appreciation while the primary victories of Patrick Buchanan are reviving political focus on the trade deficit after a period in which it faded from Washington radar screens. Recent Japanese import and export data are also calling into question how much further the trade surplus will contract if the yen stays in a range of 100-110. Many Japanese firms are profitable at yen rates of 100-110 and their exports would probably rise sharply if the yen fell back to 110-120. As recently as three months ago, by contrast, many analysts were suggesting the trade surplus would fall sharply if the yen simply held at 105 to the dollar. Persistence of a large Japanese trade surplus is potentially bullish for world financial markets because it provides a source of surplus liquidity but the yen will not weaken dramatically if the surplus remains at high levels or expands further unless Japanese investors export capital far more aggressively. Japanese investors have been boosting their purchases of Australian and European bonds during recent months but they continue to be cautious towards the dollar. Recent political developments in the U.S. will probably reinforce this caution, especially if Mr. Buchanan goes into the Republican convention with a third or more of the delegates.
<P>

The third factor which has depressed the dollar is global bond yield differentials. The German mark has rallied against the dollar because German bond yields have backed up as much as U.S. bond yields during recent weeks while the German economy is so weak that most investors expect further Bundesbank easing. At present, Germany is offering nominal bond yields of 6.2% with a prospective inflation rate of 1.5-2.0% while U.S. bond yields are 6.4% despite a prospective inflation rate closer to 3.0%. French and British real long-term interest rates are also 4.0-5.0% on the basis of current bond yields and prospective inflation performance. These yield differentials have helped to boost investor demand for European currencies.
<P>

In the second quarter, several factors could help to encourage stronger demand for the dollar.
<P>

First, the U.S. economy should improve and lessen investor concern about the risk of a recession depressing corporate profits.
<P>

Secondly, the repatriation of capital to Japan should slow, if not reverse, while many investment institutions may respond to the start of the new fiscal year by diversifying more of their portfolios into foreign securities. Recent proposals to shift a large share of pension fund assets to non-life insurance company managers also should set the stage at some point for larger capital outflows from Japan.
<P>


Thirdly, European currencies could suffer during the second quarter from investor concern about the Russian presidential election in June. The opinion polls suggest that the most likely winner is the communist candidate, Mr. Gennady Zyuganov. He has tired to reassure foreign investors that he will not reverse recent economic reforms but most Russian liberals believe that he is a front man for members of the old Nomenklatura who will do significant damage to Russia's emerging market economy. Mr. Zyuganov's party also favors restoring stronger links with the former Republics of the Soviet Union and opposing the entry of the countries of eastern Europe into NATO. As the IMF recently provided Mr. Boris Yeltsin with a $9 billion loan and he still controls the machinery of government, it is possible that he will be able to make a comeback in time for the election. But as a result of his health problems and low level of public approval, investors will have to assign a high risk to the probability of either Mr. Zyuganov winning the election or Mr. Yeltsin inventing some political excuse to delay the election (such as new military action in the Chechen Republic or a sudden decision to merge Belarus back into Russia). The first major test of market perceptions of the Russian political situation will come in April when Morgan Guaranty plans to offer a Russian Eurobond to foreign investors. If the Eurobond offering goes well, the foreign exchange market may conclude that investors are already discounting a Zyuganov victory. But as Russia has not had an open election for its head of state since 1613, it is difficult to believe that the coming presidential election will not produce some news events potentially damaging to the currencies of the countries close to Russia, including the German mark.
<P>

<B>To summarize,</B> the large rise in U.S. bond yields since late January appears to reflect a mixture of economic and political factors, including the decreased risk of a full scale recession, new pessimism about the prospects for a fiscal compromise in Washington and investor anxiety about what fragmentation of the Republican Party in recent primaries portends for this November's presidential and congressional elections. Investors are especially concerned that Patrick Buchanan's success could help to set the stage for the election of a Democratic House majority which would then embrace themes such as economic nationalism and greater federal regulation of the labor market. The firmer tone to retail sales since January suggests the U.S. economy should soon complete its inventory adjustment and return to a growth rate of 2.0-3.0% during the second quarter. But if bond yields continue to rise in response to America's new political risks, the upturn in housing could stall and depress consumer spending on furniture and appliances at a time when fiscal policy will be restrictive and monetary policy will be the primary engine for restoring growth. Rising bond yields also could depress equity prices after a market rally so broad based that U.S. corporations now have a market capitalization of $6.6 trillion or a level equal to 87.5% of GDP compared to a previous peak of 81.0% of GDP in 1929.

<I>Will Investors Or the Government Benefit From Inflation Adjusted Treasury Bonds? (continued)</I><BR>
<P>
Canada, Australia, and New Zealand followed Britain's lead by
introducing index linked debt during the 1980's and early 1990's,
but their stock of index linked debt is much smaller than Britain's
both in absolute terms and as a share of their national debt.
 Canada has about $5.8 billion ($4.4 U.S.) of index linked debt,
Australia has about $6 billion ($4.8 U.S.) and New Zealand has
only about $200 million ($130 U.S.).  New Zealand has recently
increased its use of index linked debt and investor interest has
been strong because of the high yields (5.8%) and the fact that
New Zealand will soon have an election under a new system of proportional
representation which could weaken political support for non-inflationary
economic policies.  Canada issued its first index linked bonds
during 1991 when real interest rates on conventional bonds were
at high levels and then reduced the supply as interest rates fell.
 But the Canadian govenment recently began issuing new index linked
bonds and plans to have quarterly auctions at a rate of $300-500
million.  Sweden introduced index linked bonds only last year
but it is promoting them so aggressively that they could be worth
about 10% of Sweden's $100 billion of public debt by early 1997.
 The bonds have so far suffered from illiquidity because pension
funds have been hoarding them, but the coming expansion of supply
should enhance trading.  They offer a real yield of over 5.5%
as well as an inflation adjustment but, in contrast to Britain
and Australia, there is no tax exemption for the inflation indexation
component of the return.
<P>
The U.S. Treasury plans to offer a ten year bond in denominations
as small as $1,000 in 1997 and $50 in 1998. The new bond will
be indexed by the general CPI urban inflation rate.  The Treasury
designed the bonds after holding hearings around the country about
issues such as the appropriate indexation formula and maturity
of the bonds.  It says that the model for its new security will
be the Canadian Real Return bonds.  As with Canada, the value
of the principal will be adjusted for inflation and every six
months the security will pay interest, which will be an amount
equal to a fixed percentage of the inflation adjusted value of
the principal.  The Treasury also guarantees the final payment
of principal of the security will not be less than the original
par value of the security at issuance, so deflation would not
produce a decline in the value of the bond.
<P>
The one issue which the Treasury did not propose for debate was
the tax treatment of the bonds.   It intends to tax both the real
return and the inflation adjustment component of the new instruments
despite the fact that Britain and Australia have exempted the
inflation adjustment from taxation.  Senior officials in the Clinton
administration are aware of the tax differential with the other
countries but they cannot introduce a tax allowance for the inflation
component of the bond return without obtaining Congressional permission.
 As a result of the intense partisan environment in Washington
following the early 1996 acrimony over fiscal policy, the Treasury
is reluctant to seek congressional cooperation in adding a tax
allowance.   The decision to tax the inflation component of the
return will greatly reduce the appeal of the index linked securities
for taxable investors, such as high income individuals, but it
will not discourage demand from pension funds and other tax exempt
retirement savings programs.
<P>
The Treasury has not yet volunteered an opinion on the yield which
the new index linked bonds will have to offer because it will
obviously depend upon market conditions at the time of issue.
 At present, the UK  government's index linked bond is offering
a real yield of 3.9%, the Australian and Canadian index linked
bonds offer real yields of 4.5-5.0% and New Zealand index linked
debt offers a real yield of 5.9%.  The government of the United
States should be able to sell securities at a lower yield than
her Majesty's governments in London, Ottawa, Canberra and Wellington,
but it is doubtful that the yield will be much below the yield
available on the UK securities for two reasons.  First, the U.S.
government wants to tax the security's inflation adjustment whereas
Britain and Australia do not impose any tax.  Secondly, American
investors have enjoyed such high returns on conventional financial
assets during recent years that they will probably not be attracted
to a low yield inflation adjusted security until there is more
widespread pessimism about the outlook for inflation itself. 
The real yield on U.S. equities during the 20th century has averaged
about 6.8% while the real yield during the past decade has been
close to 10.2%.  The real yield on U.S. bonds during the past
century has averaged close to 3.0% but real interest rates were
so high during the 1980's that many investors now believe they
should earn a real yield on bonds of at least 4.0-6.0% excluding
capital gains.  Since 1992, the yields on long-term Treasury securities
have fluctuated between 5.5% and 8.25% while the annual CPI inflation
rate has averaged 3.0%, 2.8% and 2.6%.  The real total return
on U.S. government bonds since 1986 has also been 5.14%.  The
major advantage of the new index linked security is that interest
payments will expand in line with the bank's inflation adjusted
principal.  Neither the coupon nor the value of the principal
will be fixed.
<P>
In its early stages, the new index linked security will probably
appeal to four categories of investors.  First, it will be of
interest to pension funds which want to obtain an inflation-adjusted
asset which they can use for matching with long-term liabilities.
 Secondly, the instrument will appeal to investment contrarians
whom believe that Wall Street has become overly optimistic about
inflation and that the move towards expansionary monetary policy
now underway in most G-7 countries will produce a burst of higher
commodity prices next year.   Since the U.S. Treasury's index
linked bond has the potential to be more liquid and tradable than
the index linked bonds of other countries, it could also help
to attract capital from inflation wary investors all over the
world.  Thirdly, many Wall Street firms will probably use the
index-linked bonds to create new hybrid securities offering arbitrage
against other potential inflation hedges, such as gold, commodities,
and real estate.  The Treasury may also produce an instrument
with strip features which could emerge as a popular way for traders
to play on the market's changing perceptions of inflation.  Wall
Street has not yet developed a nickname for the index linked bonds,
but it is not difficult to imagine labels such as the &quot;Clinton
strips&quot; or &quot;Rubin Zeros&quot; becoming popular in the
financial media.  Finally, retail investment service organizations
will probalby use the index linked bonds to develop inflation
adjusted annuities and other retirement oriented products.
<P>
When the UK government introduced index linked bonds, it was perceived
that the major loser in institutional asset allocation models
would be real estate.  As a result of Britain's high inflation
rate after 1950, property had come to play an increasingly important
role in the portfolio of many British pension funds and insurance
companies.  Because of the long upturn in the UK economy after
1982, the index linked bonds did not prevent a significant boom
in British commercial and residential real estate during the mid
and late 1980's.  But as a result of the poor performance of British
property since 1989, the odds are high that many institutions
will increase the weighting of index linked bonds at the expense
of property  and other traditional inflation hedge assets in the
future.  A similar trend could occur in the U.S. once institutions
became more comfortable with index-linked securities.
<P>
The U.S. Treasury has been debating the introduction of index
linked bonds for many years.  After the Thatcher government introduced
them in 1981, many American economists suggested that they would
be a useful innovation in government finance for the U.S. Treasury
as well.  In the early 1980's, the interaction of large budget
deficits, restrictive monetary policy, and financial deregulation
produced real yields on U.S. government bonds as high as 8-9%,
so it was widely perceived that the Treasury would be able to
save money by introducing index linked bonds.  Many economic commentators
also stressed that the introduction of index linked bonds would
deny government the benefits of future inflation in reducing its
debt servicing costs and thus remove one of the great moral hazard
risks in economic policy.  But Wall Street was opposed to the
introduction of index linked bonds and Donald Regan did not want
to challenge the dealer community.  He might also have been uncomfortable
about possible comparisons with the D-mark denominated securities
which the Treasury had briefly introduced during the Carter administration
in order to bolster investor confidence in the dollar.
<P>
The Treasury probably has several motives for introducing index
linked bonds today.
<P>
First, bond yields have recently increased by almost 100 basis
points because of investor anxiety about a revival of the economy
and the failure of congressional efforts to reduce the federal
deficit.  The Treasury hopes that it will be able to reduce its
funding costs by offering a security which is indexed for inflation.
<P>
Secondly, the index linked bonds will provide a new yardstick
for measuring inflation expectations in the financial markets.
 At present, policy makers attempt to gauge inflationary psychology
by focusing on variables such as commodity prices, gold, the Australian
dollar, and the slope of the yield curve but none of these indicators
is as pure a proxy for inflation expectations as an instrument
which will be directly linked to the CPI, the GDP deflator, or
some comparable inflation index.
<P>
Thirdly, the Treasury views the index linked bond as an instrument
which could be attractive to the baby boomers now accumulating
savings for retirement through defined contribution pension funds,
401-K plans, Individual Retirement Accounts, and so on.  The U.S.
mutual fund industry now has over $3.1 trillion of assets compared
to $4.5 trillion of assets in the banking system and nearly one
third of the mutual fund industry's assets are in long-term retirement
savings programs.  As the baby boom generation moves into its
late 40's and 50's, it will be increasing its allocation of capital
to long-term retirement savings programs which would be a natural
market for an inflation indexed security.  If the federal government
ever decides to privatize the social security system through the
creation of  Chilean style household retirement accounts, such
savings programs also would be a potentially important market
for index linked bonds.  At present, social security assets are
invested in short maturity government instruments with yields
which correlate with those in the marketplace.  They provide no
explicit guarantees against inflation despite the fact that social
security payments are indexed for inflation.
<P>
As a result of the good performance of inflation in the U.S. economy
during recent years, the introduction of U.S. Treasury index linked
debt will have a less dramatic impact on the investment community
than would have been the case during the 1970's or 1980's.  But
the yield which emerges on the index linked bonds will gradually
become an important benchmark for evaluating the portfolio returns
on both traditional investment products as well as those focused
specifically on beating inflation.
<P>
What remains to be seen is whether the U.S. Treasury will actually
be able to reduce its funding costs by introducing index linked
bonds.  Cynics have already argued that the decision to offer
index linked debts is a confirmation that inflation has bottomed
and that the government is accepting a liability which will prove
to be quite expensive in future years.  But cynicism aside, the
real problem facing the Treasury is that investors have earned
such high returns form both equities and conventional debt securities
during recent years that they may not be prepared to accept a
low real yield on a taxable index linked bond until they see clear
evidence of accelerating inflation and a correction in other financial
asset markets.  At present, there is little sign of such a sentiment
shift occurring.  Despite the recent uptick in oil and food prices,
investors have remained remarkably complacent about the risk of
higher inflation.  As a result, the Treasury should consider hedging
its new funding strategy with other financial alternatives.  Instead
of offering the public only a security indexed to the inflation
rate, it should introduce new instruments indexed to both the
inflation rate and the S&amp;P 500.  Once it has established a
market for both securities, the Treasury could then fine tune
the issuance of new supply to reflect changing investor perceptions
of the economic outlook.  On the basis of current investor attitude,
it is doubtful that the Treasury will be able to achieve significant
savings by offering instruments indexed only to the CPI.  But
by offering instruments for hedging against both inflation and
stock market risk, it should be able to both reduce government
borrowing costs and create useful instruments for helping the
baby boom generation cope with the coming transition to a privatized
social security system.

<I>Will The Dole Economic Program Boost U.S. Interest Rates? (continued)</I>


<P>

Finally, if the Dole-Kemp team takes over the White House and the Republicans retain control of the White House, there would be a far greater likelihood of radical reform in the nation's hitherto uncontrolled entitlement programs than if the nation continues with its current mix of divided government or a return to full Democratic control over the executive and legislative branches.  The Republicans would be more willing to impose limitations on the growth of Medicare spending.  There is also strong support in the Republican congressional caucus for privatization of the social security system.  The experience of other countries suggests that privatization of the social security system could have a very benign impact on U.S. interest rates by encouraging a rise in the household savings rate.
<P>
At present, most of the nation's new private savings are invested in pension funds.  Until recently, the bulk of these retirement savings were held in the form of defined benefit plans.  Under such plans, corporations made annual contributions to their pension plan in order to create the pool of savings needed to deliver a guaranteed income stream to retired workers.  During the past decade, though, there has been a major shift underway to defined contribution plans, in which corporations and workers contribute to a retirement savings program whose benefits depend upon the return earned by the assets.  Under this form of retirement savings, individuals have a choice of the assets in which their retirement funds are invested whereas under a defined benefit plan they have an income claim which is independent of the return earned by the  fund's assets.  The defined benefit plans penalized the national savings rate during 1980's.  As the stock market  appreciated, some corporations developed overfunded pension plans which attracted corporate raiders.  Other corporations responded to this threat by reducing their contributions and lowering the national savings rate.  
<P>
The defined contribution plans, by contrast, carry no such penalty for either the corporation or the worker.  An individual can save as much as he wants even if he achieves his wealth accumulation target ahead of schedule because of booming equity prices or high interest rates on his fixed income assets.  As a result of the tremendous growth occurring in defined contribution pension plans, the stock market boom of the past few years has not depressed the household savings rate.  Various forms of defined contribution  plans now account for almost one half of all pension fund savings in the U.S. and probably about one third of the three billion dollars of assets in the mutual fund industry.  If retirement savings were still dominated by defined benefit pension plans, the great equity bull market would have produced both a slump in pension contributions and the national savings rate rather than the modest uptick which has occurred since 1994.
<P>
There are many possible models for how the U.S. might privatize its social security system.  Countries as  diverse as Chile, Britain and Australia have already made major strides in the direction of government mandated retirement savings with managment of the funds by the private sector.  The basic goal of any reform program would probably be to provide every U.S. citizen with a compulsorary retirement savings program which would be invested  in a variety of potential investment products subject to careful government supervision.  If introduced to the U.S., such a retirement savings account would function very much like a defined contribution pension plan.  The individual would have an opportunity to invest his retirement savings in a variety of equity and fixed income assets whereas all social security assets are currently invested in short maturity government debt.  It is quite possible that an individual would respond to a booming stock market by reducing his pension fund contributions but, as in 1995, he might decide to maintain his flow of savings despite the rise in capital values.  Under a defined benefit plan, by contrast, the corporations would automatically curtail contributions if a rising stock market pushed asset values above the fund's actuarial target.
<P>
The current social security system has even more perverse side-effects on private savings and the federal deficit than defined benefit pension plans.  It promises a guaranteed income to every American citizen while investing the government's tax receipts in some of the lowest yielding assets available in the financial markets.
<P>
If social security assets had been invested in equities and bonds at practically any point during the past half century, the government would have been able to choose between boosting social security payments or reducing the level of payroll taxation needed to finance the system.
<P>
All the industrial nations will confront great fiscal challenges during the 21st Century because of the aging of their populations.  Two thirds of all the people who have ever lived to the age of 65 in the history of mankind are alive today and life expectancy is still increasing.
<P>
As the U.S. enjoys both a higher birth rate and greater tolerance for immigration than other industrial countries, it will face a much less profound problem in meeting this challenge than countries such as Japan and Germany.  But despite its demographic advantages, even the U.S. will have to confront difficult choices over taxation, the level of benefits, and the appropriate age of retirement during the early decades of the 21st century.
<P>
Despite the fact that Mr. Robert Dole already qualifies for social security and that President Clinton is a member of the baby boom generation which will produce major strains in the social security system's financial health, neither dares to discuss the issue of privatization because the public has not yet been educated about the choices which lie ahead.  
<P>
The White House has appointed a taskforce on social security reform but the membership is so divided they will probably delay their report until after this November's election.  The U.S. Treasury recently announced plans to introduce inflation adjusted government bonds in part because it believes such an instrument will be popular for the retirement savings programs of the baby boom generation.  But while inflation proof  bonds would be useful assets for a privatized social security system, there is no explicit link between their introduction and social security reform.  Since Mr. Dole has hinted that he will be only a one term president while Mr. Clinton will not be allowed to seek a third term, both would be well positioned to take the risk of promoting a major debate about the nation's system of retirement savings.  But on the basis of general philosophical attitudes towards the issue of entitlements in the two major political parties, a Republican White House and Congress are more likely to enact far-reaching social security reforms than a divided government or one dominated solely by the Democrats.  As the critical determinant of the level of U.S. interest rates in the year 2000 will be how social security reform affects the U.S. savings rate, not whether the Congress approves the Dole or Clinton economic programs, a Republican victory in November should not be viewed as negative for the U.S. bond market.

<I>Will Federal Devolution Set the Stage for a State and Local
Privatization Boom in the Next U.S. Recession? (continued)</I><BR>

<P><BR>
Fifth, the U.S. has enjoyed a five year bull market in stocks and bonds which
has produced tremendous gains in household wealth as well as opportunities for
entrepreneurial companies to raise capital.  At the peak in June, the ratio of
stock market capitalization to GDP in the U.S. was about $7 trillion or 91% of
GDP.  This was the highest since 1929, when the market was worth about 81% of
GDP.  The stock market boom has added $2 billion to household net worth since
1984.  It also has permitted an extraordinary boom in new equity public
offerings and corporate fund raising through the sale of non-investment grade
bonds. The number of equity I.P.O.'s was 428 during the first half of 1996
compared to 470 during 1995, 599 during 1994, and a peak of 689 during 1993.
These I.P.O.'s raised about $27.2 billion during the first half of 1996
compared to $27.7 billion last year, $27.7 billion during 1994 and $39.2
billion during 1993.  The peak for I.P.O. financing during the 1980's, by
contrast, was $17.7 billion during 1986.  The search for higher yields also has
helped to revitalize the so-called junk bond market.  In the first half of
1996, Wall Street sold 108 new non-investment grade bond offering compared to
159 during 1995, 190 during 1994, and 343 during 1993.  The funds raised were
$20 billion during the first half of 1996, $28.8 billion during 1995, $231.5
billion during 1994, and $54.4 billion during 1993.  The previous peak in
non-investment grade bond financing was 218 deals worth $30.5 billion during
1986.  The ability of small and medium sized companies to obtain so much
capital from the stock market has helped to encourage the high growth rate of
investment and employment since 1993.<p>
<p>
The stock market boom has also been accompanied by a dramatic expansion of the
mutual fund industry and new forms of retirement savings, such as defined
contribution pension plans which could encourage an impovement in the national
savings rate.  The mutual fund industry now has assets of over $3 trillion
compared to $4.2 trillion in the banking system and nearly one third of mutual
fund assets are in long-term savings programs.  There is some evidence that
defined contribution pension plans have a more positive impact on household
savings during periods of rising equity prices than the traditional defined
benefit pension plans.  Under defined contribution plans, there is no penalty
for households to maintain a steady flow of savings into their retirement
programs as asset prices rise whereas corporations which overfund their pension
plans penalize profits and attract corporate raiders.  In 1995, the household
savings rate in the U.S. rose despite the boom in equity prices.  The uptick in
the savings rate may have resulted from the shift towards greater use of
defined contribution pension system.  The growth of defined contibution savings
could accelerate further if the White House and Congress ever agree to
privatize social security.<p>
<p>
Sixth, the U.S. economy has been a major economic beneficiary of the end of the
cold war and the acceptance of liberal economic ideas by many formerly
communist or mercantilist countries.  The U.S. sends about one third of its
exports to developing countries and during the past five years these markets
have accounted for over two thirds of all export growth.  In 1995, this export
growth slowed because of the financial crisis in Mexico and its spillover
effects on other Latin American countries.  But the IMF-U.S. Treasury rescue
program for Mexico helped to stabilize her financial system and has set the
stage for a recovery this year.  The ability of Mexico to avoid default also
helped to lessen the impact of her crises on other developing countries,
especially in Latin America.<p>
<p>
Finally, the general mix of macroeconomic policy in all the major industrial
nations since 1992 has been supportive of non-inflationary growth.  European
governments have been attempting to reduce their budget deficits by trimming
their public spending. The counterpart to this deficit reduction has been a
large decline in the level of both short-term and long-term interest rates.
Japan has been an outlier to the process of deficit reduction because of the
impact of her  banking crisis on the economy.  But the Bank of Japan has
nevertheless cut short-term interest rates to only 50 basis points in order to
help prop up the financial system.  The current level of interest rates in
Japan is the lowest to occur in any industrial country since the Great
Depression of the 1930's.<p>
<p>
The challenge now confronting Federal Reserve policy makers is to sustain the
expansion by finding a rate of growth which is consistent with the economy's
underlying supply side potential.  There are many points of view on the level
of growth which is optimal for the economy but the Federal Reserve perceives
that the number is about 2.0-2.5% once the economy achieves full employment.
As the economy enjoyed 4.0-5.0% output growth during the second quarter and is
probably expanding at a 3.0-3.5% annual rate during the current quarter, the
odds are high that there could be Federal Reserve tightening during the next
few months to slow the economy's rate of growth.  In fact, a rate hike during
late August is very likely  unless the upcoming data for employment costs shows
a reversal of the uptick which became apparent during the first quarter.<p>
<p>
As inflation expectations are still under control, it is doubtful that the Fed
will raise interest rates by more than 50 basis points this year but there will
be no way to predict the peak until the economy actually slows.  Another
wildcard in the outlook is the lending policies of the credit card companies.
The credit card companies have been so permissive in permitting low income
households to gain access to cards that their stock of non-performing loans has
risen sharply.  If they suddenly curtail access to cards by imposing more
stringent lending quality screens, they will depress consumer spending by lower
income Americans (who account for about 10% of the total).<p>
<p>
A policy of Federal Reserve fine tuning will not cause any sudden or abrupt
changes in the economy's performance this autumn but it could produce a
correction in the equity market.  In fact, the equity market has been very
turbulent during the past four weeks because of investor concern about both
monetary policy and the economic policy risks poised by this autumn's election.
<p>
<p>
Investors are concerned about monetary tightening because they fear it could
set the stage for a profit squeeze next year.  With wages rising in response to
tight labor markets, corporations will find it more difficult to sustain their
profit margins, especially if Fed tightening slows the economy's growth rate.
In 1994, by contrast, the Fed had tightened to reduce upward pressure on
commodity prices, not wages.  Rising commodity prices redistributed income
within the corporate sector whereas rising wages reduce the profit share of
national income.<p>
<p>
Investor confidence also has been depressed by the extremely poor performance
of Robert Dole in the opinion polls. Wall Street has long perceived President
Clinton to be a superior campaigner but they had expected Dole to benefit from
Clinton's scandals in the "emerging market" state of Arkansas as well as his
own retirement from the Senate.  With Mr. Dole still 15-20 points behind in the
opinion polls, investors are becoming apprehensive about the risk of the
Republicans losing control of the Congress, not just the race for the White
House.<p>
<p>
The prospect of the Republicans losing control of the Congress is disturbing to
Wall Street for several reasons.<p>
<p>
First, the 1996 election poses a unique historic challenge for both parties.
No Democratic president has won two consecutive elections since Franklin
Roosevelt in the 1930's.  The Republican Party has not controlled the Congress
for  two consecutive terms since the 1920's.  If the Republicans lose control
again in 1996, it will suggest that the public is turning away from their
themes of deficit reduction, slowing growth of entitlement spending, and
promoting lower marginal income tax rates.<p>
<p>
Secondly, there has been a profound change in the character of the Democratic
Party in the Congress as a result of recent Republican victories.  The
Republican Party now has 77 of the 125 house seats of the old southern
Confederacy compared to 48 in 1992, 34 in 1972 and 6 in 1960.  On the basis of
pending Democratic retirements, the Republicans may even be able to claim
control over two thirds of the seats in the south by next year even if they
lose their overall majority.  As a result of the Republican takeover of the
south, the Democrats now depend far more upon the urban centers of the
northeast, the middle west and California for their congressional membership.
This geographic shift in the composition of the parties suggests that future
Democratic committee chairman would be far more supportive of federal spending
programs and other forms of government intervention in the economy than both
the current Republican chairmen and past Democratic chairmen.<p>
<p>
Thirdly, if the Democrats win a majority in the House, their new speaker would
be Richard Gephardt.  After flirting with the many "New Democratic" political
themes during the mid-1980's, Rep. Gephardt has devoted most of the past decade
to espousing protectionist trade policies, higher marginal income tax rates,
and other forms of government intervention in the economy.<p>
<p>
As a result of the ideological polarization which has occurred in the
congressional membership of both major political parties, a Democratic victory
in this November's congressional races would probably have three immediate
effects on the economy.<p>
<p>
It would encourage investors to sell both U.S. bonds and the U.S. dollar.<p>
<p>
It would probably cause all investors to reduce their exposure to Mexico as
well as other emerging market countries which might be vulnerable to
congressional demands for more restrictive trade polices.<p>
<p>
It would probably encourage many U.S. companies to defer decisions about new
investment and hiring until they had more visibility on how the election would
affect public policy in such critical areas as taxation and labor market
regulation.  Ironically, such caution might cause bond yields to fall during
early 1997, when lower investment depressed the economy, but in late 1996 the
weakness of bond prices would itself help to set the stage for the economic
slowdown.<p>

<I>How Will Investors Respond to the U.S. Government's Inflation Adjusted Bond? (continued)</I>

<P>
The Treasury is also asking for debate about the structure of
the new securities.  Should it offer a zero coupon bond or a security
which provides current  income?  In the case of  a bond with current
income, should the indexation for inflation occur monthly, quarterly,
or annually and how long should the lag be with the inflation
rate?  In Britain, there is an eight month indexation lag and
it is perceived to reduce the attractiveness of index linked securities.
 The one issue which the Treasury has not proposed for debate
is the tax treatment of the bonds.   It intends to tax both the
real return and the inflation adjustment component of the new
instruments despite the fact that Britain, Canada and other Commonwealth
countries have exempted the inflation adjustment from taxation.
 Senior officials in the Clinton administration are aware of the
tax differential with the other countries but they cannot introduce
a tax allowance for the inflation component of the bond return
without obtaining Congressional permission.  As a result of the
intense partisan environment in Washington following this winter's
acrimony over fiscal policy, they are reluctant to seek congressional
cooperation in adding a tax allowance.   The decision to tax the
inflation component of the return will greatly reduce the appeal
of the index linked securities for taxable investors, such as
high income individuals, but it will not discourage demand from
pension funds and other tax exempt retirement savings programs.
<P>
The Treasury has not yet volunteered an opinion on the yield which
the new index linked bonds will have to offer because it will
obviously depend upon market conditions at the time of issue.
 At present, the UK  government's index linked bond is offering
a real yield of 3.9%, the Australian and Canadian index linked
bonds offer real yields of 4.5-5.0% and New Zealand index linked
debt offers a real yield of 5.9%.  The government of the United
States should be able to sell securities at a lower yield than
her Majesty's governments in London, Ottawa, Canberra and Wellington,
but it is doubtful that the yield will be much below the yield
available on the UK securities for two reasons.  First, the U.S.
government wants to tax the security's inflation adjustment whereas
Her Majesty's governments in other English speaking countries
do not impose any tax.  Secondly, American investors have enjoyed
such high returns on conventional financial assets during recent
years that they will probably not be attracted to a low yield
inflation adjusted security until there is more widespread pessimism
about the outlook for inflation itself.  The real yield on U.S.
equities during the 20th century has averaged about 6.8% while
the real yield during the past decade has been close to 10.2%.
 The real yield on U.S. bonds during the past century has averaged
close to 3.0% but real interest rates were so high during the
1980's that many investors now believe they should earn a real
yield on bonds of at least 4.0-6.0% excluding capital gains. 
Since 1992, the yields on long-term Treasury securities have fluctuated
between 5.5% and 8.25% while the annual CPI inflation rate has
averaged 3.0%, 2.8% and 2.6%.  The real total return on U.S. government
bonds since 1986 has also been 5.14%.
<P>
In its early stages, the new index linked security will probably
appeal to four categories of investors.  First, it will be of
interest to pension funds which want to obtain an inflation-adjusted
asset which they can use for matching with long-term liabilities.
 Secondly, the instrument will appeal to investment contrarians
whom believe that Wall Street has become overly optimistic about
inflation and that the move towards expansionary monetary policy
now underway in most G-7 countries will produce a burst of higher
commodity prices next year.   Since the U.S. Treasury's index
linked bond has the potential to be more liquid and tradable than
the index linked bonds of other countries, it could also help
to attract capital from inflation wary investors all over the
world.  Thirdly, many Wall Street firms will probably use the
index-linked bonds to create new hybrid securities offering arbitrage
against other potential inflation hedges, such as gold, commodities,
and real estate.  The Treasury may also produce an instrument
with strip features which could emerge as a popular way for traders
to play on the market's changing perceptions of inflation.  Wall
Street has not yet developed a nickname for the index linked bonds,
but it is not difficult to imagine labels such as the &quot;Clinton
strips&quot; or &quot;Rubin Zeros&quot; becoming popular in the
financial media.  Finally, retail investment service organizations
will probalby use the index linked bonds to develop inflation
adjusted annuities and other retirement oriented products.
<P>
When the UK government introduced index linked bonds, it was perceived
that the major loser in institutional asset allocation models
would be real estate.  As a result of Britain's high inflation
rate after 1950, property had come to play an increasingly important
role in the portfolio of many British pension funds and insurance
companies.  Because of the long upturn in the UK economy after
1982, the index linked bonds did not prevent a significant boom
in British commercial and residential real estate during the mid
and late 1980's.  But as a result of the poor performance of British
property since 1989, the odds are high that many institutions
will increase the weighting of index linked bonds at the expense
of property  and other traditional inflation hedge assets in the
future.  A similar trend could occur in the U.S. once institutions
became more comfortable with index-linked securities.

<P>
The U.S. Treasury has been debating the introduction of index
linked bonds for many years.  After the Thatcher government introduced
them in 1981, many American economists suggested that they would
be a useful innovation in government finance for the U.S. Treasury
as well.  In the early 1980's, the interaction of large budget
deficits, restrictive monetary policy, and financial deregulation
produced real yields on U.S. government bonds as high as 8-9%,
so it was widely perceived that the Treasury would be able to
save money by introducing index linked bonds.  Many economic commentators
also stressed that the introduction of index linked bonds would
deny government the benefits of future inflation in reducing its
debt servicing costs and thus remove one of the great moral hazard
risks in economic policy.  But Wall Street was opposed to the
introduction of index linked bonds and Donald Regan did not want
to challenge the dealer community.  He might also have been uncomfortable
about possible comparisons with the D-mark denominated securities
which the Treasury had briefly introduced during the Carter administration
in order to bolster investor confidence in the dollar.
<P>
The Treasury probably has several motives for introducing index
linked bonds today.
<P>
First, bond yields have recently increased by almost 100 basis
points because of investor anxiety about a revival of the economy
and the failure of congressional efforts to reduce the federal
deficit.  The Treasury hopes that it will be able to reduce its
funding costs by offering a security which is indexed for inflation.
<P>
Secondly, the index linked bonds will provide a new yardstick
for measuring inflation expectations in the financial markets.
 At present, policy makers attempt to gauge inflationary psychology
by focusing on variables such as commodity prices, gold, the Australian
dollar, and the slope of the yield curve but none of these indicators
is as pure a proxy for inflation expectations as an instrument
which will be directly linked to the CPI, the GDP deflator, or
some comparable inflation index.
<P>
Thirdly, the Treasury views the index linked bond as an instrument
which could be attractive to the baby boomers now accumulating
savings for retirement through defined contribution pension funds,
401-K plans, Individual Retirement Accounts, and so on.  The U.S.
mutual fund industry now has over $3 trillion of assets compared
to $4.2 trillion of assets in the banking system and nearly one
third of the mutual fund industry's assets are in long-term retirement
savings programs.  As the baby boom generation moves into its
late 40's and 50's, it will be increasing its allocation of capital
to long-term retirement savings programs which would be a natural
market for an inflation indexed security.  If the federal government
ever decides to privatize the social security system through the
creation of  Chilean style household retirement accounts, such
savings programs also would be a potentially important market
for index linked bonds.  At present, social security assets are
invested in short maturity government instruments with yields
which correlate with those in the marketplace.  They provide no
explicit guarantees against inflation despite the fact that social
security payments are indexed for inflation.
<P>
As a result of the good performance of inflation in the U.S. economy
during recent years, the introduction of U.S. Treasury index linked
debt will have a less dramatic impact on the investment community
than would have been the case during the 1970's or 1980's.  But
the yield which emerges on the index linked bonds will gradually
become an important benchmark for evaluating the portfolio returns
on both traditional investment products as well as those focused
specifically on beating inflation.
<P>
What remains to be seen is whether the U.S. Treasury will actually
be able to reduce its funding costs by introducing index linked
bonds.  Cynics have already argued that the decision to offer
index linked debts is a confirmation that inflation has bottomed
and that the government is accepting a liability which will prove
to be quite expensive in future years.  But cynicism aside, the
real problem facing the Treasury is that investors have earned
such high returns form both equities and conventional debt securities
during recent years that they may not be prepared to accept a
low real yield on a taxable index linked bond until they see clear
evidence of accelerating inflation and a correction in other financial
asset markets.  At present, there is little sign of such a sentiment
shift occurring.  Despite the recent uptick in oil and food prices,
investors have remained remarkably complacent about the risk of
higher inflation.  As a result, the Treasury should consider hedging
its new funding strategy with other financial alternatives.  Instead
of offering the public only a security indexed to the inflation
rate, it should introduce new instruments indexed to both the
inflation rate and the S&amp;P 500.  Once it has established a
market for both securities, the Treasury could then fine tune
the issuance of new supply to reflect changing investor perceptions
of the economic outlook.  On the basis of current investor attitude,
it is doubtful that the Treasury will be able to achieve significant
savings by offering instruments indexed only to the CPI.  But
by offering instruments for hedging against both inflation and
stock market risk, it should be able to both reduce government
borrowing costs and create useful instruments for helping the
baby boom generation cope with the coming transition to a privatized
social security system.

<I>Economic Implications of the Mutual Fund Boom (continued)</I><BR>

<P><BR>


While low interest rates helped to ignite the mutual fund boom of the early 1990's, several other factors are now helping to sustain it.

<P>

First, the industry has been steadily expanding its range of products.  There are now 2211 equity funds compared to 1127 in 1990 and 471 in 1984.  In the equity sector, there are now 352 aggressive growth funds, 699 general growth funds, 481 growth and income funds, 33 precious metal funds, 112 equity income funds, 367 international equity funds (excludes U.S.) and 167 global equity funds (includes U.S.).  In the fixed income sector, there are now 2,544 bond funds compared to 1,235 in 1990 and 349 in 1994.  There are 332 government bond funds, 99 high yield corporate bond funds, 306 long-term municipal bond funds, and hundreds of other bond funds offering different combinations of yield and risk.   In the money market sector, there are 672 taxable money market funds, 158 national tax exempt money market funds, and 167 state tax exempt money market funds.   Despite the proliferation of new funds, though, assets in the industry are becoming more concentrated.  The top five fund management groups now account for 36% of industry assets compared to 29% in 1984.  These organizations are spending heavily on marketing and thus increasing consumer awareness of new mutual fund products.

<P>

Secondly, the expansion of the mutual fund industry has coincided with a dramatic expansion of U.S. stock market capitalization.  In January, the market capitalization of America's 7,551 listed companies was about $6.63 trillion compared to $5 trillion in January, 1994 (6,925 companies) and $3,957 trillion in January, 1992 (5,608 companies).  The ratio of stock market capitalization to GDP has risen to 87.5% compared to a previous all time high of 81.0% in 1929 and a post war peak of 79.0% in 1968.  The all time trough of stock market capitalization to GDP was 16.0% in 1941 while in the post-war era it was 30.0% in 1974 and 1982.  The average ratio of stock market capitalization to GDP since 1926 has been 48.0%.  Rising equity prices have had a self-reinforcing impact on mutual fund demand by encouraging greater risk-taking in the household sector.

<P>

Some stock market pundits regard the sharp rise in the ratio of stock market capitalization to GDP as a sign of speculative overheating but evidence of serious excesses is inconclusive.  The market's price/earnings ratio is only about 16-17 compared to 26 in 1991 and levels in the 15-19 range during the late 1960's, when interest rates were previously at current levels.    Aside from the ratio of stock market capitalization to GDP, the two  measures of equity valuation which appear to be at extreme levels are dividend yields and Tobin's Q (the ratio of stock market value to asset replacement costs).    The U.S. equity market now offers a dividend yield of only 2.6% compared to a previous trough of 2.7% in 1972 and an average of 4.0% during the 1980's.  The ratio of equity prices to asset replacement costs has risen to 1.47 from a previous peak of 1.08 in 1965 and an average of .56 during the 1980's.  But there are four explanations for the stock market's valuation  level which suggest that the U.S. equity market may not be over-extended.    First, inflation expectations have been falling steadily during recent years and economic forecasters are now projecting that it will remain subdued through  at least  1997.    Secondly, despite  low  inflation, the return on U.S. corporate capital has risen above 10% during the past two years for the first time since the late 1960's.  The gains in profitability have resulted from expanded productivity and thus also contributed to the low inflation evironment in the economy.  Thirdly, it is difficult for traditional measures of book value and asset replacement cost to capture the earnings potential which companies have as a result of new developments in technology and investment in human capital.  As U.S. firms dominate many high technology sectors and technology has been an important market theme since 1994, book value has been a less dominant criteria for investment decision making.  Finally, the end of the cold war has created a global market economy with 6 billion people compared to the 1.5 billion living in market oriented economies before 1989.  In fact, if we add the foreign sales of U.S. multinational firms to GDP in order to compute a ratio of stock market capitalization to American controlled output, the ratio of stock market capitalization to output drops from 87.5% to 75%.  American firms now have $1.5 trillion of foreign sales excluding exports and this number should expand rapidly as they diversify into new high growth developing countries.

<P>

Thirdly, the mutual fund industry is benefiting from the high growth of retirement oriented savings products, such as Individual Retirement Accounts, 401-K plans, and various forms of defined contribution pension plans.  In 1994, such retirement savings accounted for $716 billion of the industry's $2.1 trillion of assets.  IRA programs had $362 billion of assets while defined contribution pension plans had $236 billion of assets.  As a growing number of companies are shifting from defined benefit pension plans to defined contribution plans, the retirement savings held in mutual funds should expand at a steady rate in the future.  In the late 1970's, Peter Drucker had produced a book contending that the U.S. was evolving towards a pension fund form of socialism, in which retirement plans would own most of the U.S. industry and alter worker attitudes towards business.  But this argument was misfocused because the defined benefit plans which prevailed in that period offered the workers guaranteed returns, not the right to choose between a variety of funds with potentially divergent returns.  Today, retirement plans are continuing to expand their ownership of the stock market but they are not producing a passive form of pension fund socialism.  The U.S. is instead embarking upon an unprecedented experiment in the democratization of bond and equity ownership through a mixture of mutual funds, defined contribution pension plans, and direct ownership of securities.  The New York Stock Exchange recently published a study estimating that 51.3 million Americans now own shares directly or through retirement savings programs compared to 42.9 million in 1989, 20 million in 1965 and 6 million during the early 1950's.

A change in total return, considered to be the
best measure of fund
performance, could occur as a result of a change
in a dividend paid, a
change in net asset value or a combination of
both. 
<P>

Income fund shareholders may be more sensitive to
changes in dividends
because of their relative higher reliance on
dividend income. In
addition, income funds often pay as frequently as
once a month. 
<P>

Dividends paid by an equity fund include
distributions of the dividends
paid by stocks owned by the portfolio and any
profits earned when
individual stocks are sold. Any gains are
distributed at least annually,
and it is reasonable to expect some variation in
the dividend payment
from period to period.
<P>

Information on the fund's performance compared to
funds with similar
investment objectives can provide an insight that
absolute return
numbers cannot. No investor is pleased with
negative returns, for
example, but there will always be economic
periods that are hostile to
investors.

<P>
The most distinctive feature of the world's financial markets this
autumn is their capacity for accepting increased political risks
in the pursuit of higher asset returns. <I>Financial markets in
countries as diverse as New Zealand, Italy and the Ukraine are
experiencing rallies which suggest that the world is awash with
surplus liquidity and that investors believe the commitment to
liberal economic reform which swept the Anglo-Saxon world after
the first Thatcher election victory of 1979 is immune to electoral
reversals. </I>
<P>
After ten years of supporting one of the world's most aggressive
economic liberalization programs, the voters of New Zealand have
elected a new parliament in which three left of center and populist
political parties will have 55% of the seats. Yet instead of declining,
New Zealand's debt and equity markets rallied on the perception
that the election will probably be irrelevant to the country's
economic performance. Optimists believe that the forces of the
post cold war global marketplace are too powerful for any new
left-wing government to restore New Zealand's pre-1984 tradition
of protectionism and lavish welfare spending. A few pundits even
hope that the election has left the parliament so fragmented that
it will be impossible for the parties to form an effective government.
The 1996 New Zealand election was the first held under the country's
new system of proportional representation and thus encouraged
far more fragmentation than the traditional Westminster system
of electing M.P.'s (single member seats awarded to the candidate
with a plurality of votes).
<P>
In early October, the international credit rating agencies gave
Russia a series of ratings which ranged from BB+ (IBCA) to BB-
(S&amp;P 500) with Moody's in the middle at BA2. Such ratings
place Russia towards the upper end of the Brady bond market, ahead
of Brazil but still below Poland. There is little doubt that Russia
will someday deserve a high credit rating. It has immense natural
resources, a low ratio of government debt to GDP and during the
decade before 1914 was one of the world's high growth economies
and large scale capital importers. But the decision to award such
a high credit rating when Russia's political situation is in a
state of flux provides further confirmation of the financial community's
increasing tolerance for risk. Meanwhile, the improvement in Russia's
credit rating has caused such a large rally in Russian debt prices
that adventuresome investors are now shifting capital from the
Russian securities market to the Ukraine. The economic reform
program in the Ukraine has been lagging far behind Russia's, so
the yield on Ukrainian government debt was still above 70% in
September. But as a result of the flight from quality in Russia,
yields on Ukrainian Treasury bills have plunged to barely 50%
during the past two weeks despite a projected inflation rate of
112% this year. Russia's yields also have stabilized at about
50-55% compared to 150-200% during the spring.
<P>
The bond markets of Italy and Spain have also experienced major
rallies since August in the expectation that European governments
will introduce a broad based monetary union in 1999 despite the
failure of several countries to comply with the spirit, if not
the letter, of the Maastricht terms for economic convergence.
The yield gap between German and Italian bonds has fallen from
650 basis points eighteen months ago to just over 200 basis points
today. <I>Investors have bid up the price of Italian securities
in the expectation that German politicians will permit Italy to
enter the monetary union in 1999 despite the fact that the country's
ratio of public debt to GDP is almost 120% compared to a Maastricht
target of 60%.</I> The market's new optimism about Italy's entry
to EMU is based on the fact that the German officials appear willing
to accept liberal interpretations of the Maastricht agreement
for France and Belgium. They are permitting France to achieve
its deficit target through one time revenue transfers from the
pension funds of state enterprises. They seem willing to let Belgium
enter the union despite the fact that her ratio of public debt
to GDP exceeds 100%. In recent days, Bundesbank officials and
members of the Social Democratic Party responsible for monitoring
monetary policy have begun to suggest that they will not encourage
entry for countries which engage in accounting adjustments to
reduce their fiscal deficit to 3.0% of GDP. But investors have
not focused on these objections because of hopes that they will
at most delay EMU entry for Spain and Italy by two or three years,
not postpone it until all the Maastricht conditions are satisfied.
While German officials can persuade their public to accept Belgian
membership at the start of EMU, Italy is too large a country to
enter under current circumstances despite the fact that Italy
was among the original six countries which signed the Treaty of
Rome creating the European Common Market in 1958.
<P>
When one considers the resilience of the New Zealand financial
market and the aggressive investor demand for bonds in Europe's
peripheral debt markets during recent weeks, it is not surprising
that the Dow Jones Industrial average has reached new highs during
October. The outlook for the U.S. economy is still benign. The
markets have been discounting a Clinton victory in the presidential
election for several weeks while investors remain hopeful that
the Republicans will retain at least a narrow majority in both
houses of the Congress.

<P>
The Fed's decision to leave U.S. interest rates unchanged at its
meeting on September 24th has left many unresolved questions for
the financial markets to ponder.  Was the focus of the FOMC meeting
the outlook for the U.S. economy or the breach of security which
produced a Reuters story about several district banks seeking
a discount rate hike the week before the meeting?  Did the FOMC
renew its previous directive with a bias towards tightening and
thus leave open the possibility of raising interest rates in response
to economic reports during October, or has it closed the door
on possible tightening until November?  How far will the chairman
go in attempting to assert his authority over FOMC dissidents
who have attempted to campaign for a rate hike through conversations
with the media?
<P>
There is no way of telling whether the Reuters story about the
district banks altered the outcome of the FOMC meeting.  <I>If
the retail sales and inflation data published in mid-September
had showed clear signs of accelerating inflation and robust growth
in final demand, there is little doubt that the FOMC would have
hiked interest rates.</I>  But because the data suggested that
growth may be moderating and that inflation is still under control,
the Chairman was able to persuade the FOMC to defer any proposal
for tightening in order to demonstrate that he is still firmly
in control of the Federal Reserve.  It is doubtful, though, that
the FOMC abandoned its bias in favor of tightening.  On the contrary,
if the employment report scheduled to appear on October 4th shows
signs of strong growth in the U.S. economy, the Fed could move
to hike interest rates immediately.  Almost 90% of the upward
move in U.S. bond yields this year has occurred in the minutes
after three employment reports showing large monthly job gains.
 If the October 4th report produces evidence of large job gains
(over 250,000) and the unemployment rate drops below 5.0%, there
will probably be another upward spike in bond yields so large
that the Fed will feel compelled to show that it has not become
totally passive.  The rally in the bond market after the Fed decision
to leave interest rates unchanged demonstrates that investors
are as uncertain about the U.S. economic outlook as the FOMC.
 But since the preconditions for an acceleration of wage growth
and a revival of inflation clearly exist, the Fed cannot afford
to procrastinate for long when new data appears confirming that
the economy is still expanding at a growth rate well above 2.0%.
<P>
<I>There is little disagreement at the Federal Reserve that the
preconditions for a revival of inflation are appearing.</I>  <I>The
dissension about policy centers on three questions.</I>  First,
is the third quarter slowdown in domestic final sales growth to
1.5-2.0% from 4.8% during the second quarter temporary or the
start of a prolonged trend?  Secondly, is government data understating
productivity growth and thus causing policy makers to be overly
pessimistic about the economy's optimal non-inflationary growth
rate?  Thirdly, if wages do accelerate further, will corporations
be able to pass on the cost hikes to consumers or will they simply
erode profit margins?
<P>
The answer to the first question will be provided by forthcoming
retail sales and capital goods orders data for September and October.
 The growth of consumer spending did slow sharply during the third
quarter (it appears to be 1.2% compared to 3.4% during the first
half) but it should not remain subdued if employment continues
to expand at a steady rate and consumers remain confident.  The
September Conference Board survey of consumer confidence is positive
on both counts.  It shows that confidence remained close to 112
for a second consecutive month during September compared to 100
in June.  Household perceptions of the job market also were very
positive.  About 27.0% said that jobs were plentiful compared
to 24.8% during June while only 20.8% said jobs were hard to get
compared to 22.0-23.6% during the second quarter.  <I>If resilient
consumer confidence produces a rebound in retail sales during
the autumn, real GDP growth will probably accelerate to the 3.0-3.5%
range during the fourth quarter from 2.0-2.5% during the third
quarter.</I>  Business fixed investment also should expand at
a 5.0-6.0% annual rate during the second half compared to 4.0%
during the second quarter and 11.6% during the first quarter.
 While the computer sector is experiencing a slowdown, the high
level of manufacturing capacity utilization rates, the 10-12%
profit growth now occurring in the corporate sector, and the high
value of American share prices in relation to asset replacement
costs should encourage other sectors to expand their investment
outlays.
<P>
<I>The current financial environment in the U.S. today is probably
more supportive of business expansion than any other in recent
years.</I>  The number of equity I.P.O.'s was 428 during the first
half of 1996 compared to 573 during all of 1995, 571 during 1994,
and a peak of 665 during 1993.  These I.P.O.'s raised about $27.2
billion during the first half of 1996 compared to $28.9 billion
last year, $22.9 billion during 1994 and $34.0 billion during
1993.   As a result of the stock market boom, the U.S. venture
capital industry will be able to provide entrepreneurs with almost
$4 billion of new capital this year or the highest level since
1987.  According to a recent survey by the National Federation
of Independent Business, entrepreneurs established  nearly 3.5
million new businesses in the U.S. last year.  While many of these
new businesses may employ only one person, the rate of new business
formation suggests that demand for labor will persist at high
levels if firms can actually find new workers.  If rising wages
and faltering productivity starts to depress profit margins, the
business sector could turn more cautious about new hiring and
investment.  But it is difficult to find such signs of caution
in either business surveys or the financial markets at present.
<P>
The major business risk in the outlook is the rising delinquency
rates on consumer debt and the pressure it is putting on banks
to impose tougher quality  standards on people being screened
for credit cards.  But as Fed Governor Larry Lindsey explained
in recent congressional testimony, it would be imprudent to over-generalize
about the dangers poised by consumer debt until the economy starts
to experience increasing unemployment.  Lindsey reported to the
Congress,
<P><BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>&quot;Consumer delinquencies on nonmortgage debt have increased
in recent periods and bankruptcy filing could well exceed one
million in 1996.  These developments have begun to affect profit
margins at some financial institutions and the Federal Reserve
has been closely monitoring these conditions and discussing their
implications with individual banking organizations and industry
groups.  In our view, given the generally strong financial condition
of the institutions most affected by these developments and that
the U.S. banking system, these adverse trends do not currently
present a material threat either to individual banking organizations
 to the overall banking system.&quot;</I></BLOCKQUOTE>

The poor performance of the U.S. bond market since the decision of the Federal Open Market Committee to leave U.S. interest rates unchanged at its late August meeting reflects growing investor apprehension about the strength of the U.S. economy.  The low level of unemployment claims, the buoyancy of the equity market, and anecdotal evidence of resilient retail sales suggest that the economy is continuing to expand at an annual rate of at least 3.0%.  Such a number is not alarming by historical standards, but it is troublesome for the financial markets when it occurs against a backdrop of only 5.5% unemployment and widespread business concern about labor scarcity.  There is also increasing evidence that the government's GDP accounts may be underestimating the economy's true growth rate.  During the past year, real personal and business incomes have expanded at a rate about 1.0% higher than official measures of real output.  As the government's estimates of income and output are supposed to converge over time, it appears increasingly likely that the government's new system of GDP measurement is underestimating the economy's true growth rate.
<P>
There is evidence that the Federal Reserve is deeply divided about the inflation risks in the U.S. economy.  District presidents from the middle west have become increasingly vociferous about the danger of low unemployment pushing up wages and reviving inflationary psychology, but the new Clinton appointees to the FOMC have been reluctant to raise interest rates only a few months after their appointments.  As the Clinton appointees are mainstream economists who understand the inflation risks poised by high levels of resource utilization, it is doubtful that they will oppose monetary tightening if unemployment declines further this autumn.  But the delays in Fed tightening could still set the stage for a sharp rise in bond yields because of market concern about the Fed pursuing too passive a monetary strategy in the run-up to the presidential election.   A sharp rise in bond yields will probably also depress the equity market and provide the Dole campaign with an opportunity to raise questions about the economic outlook for 1997.
<P>
The evidence of the economy enjoying above trend growth is widespread.  The level of unemployment claims has dropped to a six year low.  The Manpower Employment survey is projecting expanded hiring activity during the fourth quarter.  Retailers are experiencing good back to school sales.  The level of capital goods orders, excluding the aircraft and defense sectors, rose to $127.8 billion during July from $125 billion during June and the second quarter average was $123.8 billion.  The July Dun and Bradstreet survey of business expectations is projecting healthy gains in both orders and production.  The production index rose to 43 from 37 in June while the order index shot up to 46 from 40 in June.  Most measures of consumer confidence are also very upbeat.  In fact, the University of  Michigan survey of consumer perceptions of government economic policy during July showed that for the first time in the history of the Clinton administration as many people now think that government policy is good (22%) as think it is poor (22%).  The Michigan index of the overall approval rating of government policy is also at 100 compared to 50-60 during late 1992 and a previous peak of 118 during the mid-1980's.
<P>
Some of the sectors which boosted output growth during the second quarter are losing momentum.  The auto industry is projecting unit sales of only 15.3 million during the second half of 1996 compared to 15.6 million during the first half. Home sales should soon respond to the uptick which occurred in mortgage rates during the spring.  As a result, residential construction activity will slow compared to annualized rates of gain of 15.1% during the second quarter and 7.4% during the first quarter.
<P>
It also is unclear how large a contribution inventory will make to the economy's third quarter growth rate.  The level of non-farm inventory accumulation shot up to $11.9 billion at annual rates during the second quarter from $2.9 billion during the first quarter and $19.0 billion during the fourth quarter of last year.  In June, it appeared that the auto industry would attempt to boost inventories during the third quarter in order to compensate for the risk of a strike during September, but the purchasing agent survey for July showed no evidence of an inventory build-up.  As inventory levels are satisfactory in most industries, inventories will not be a drag on third quarter output growth but their contribution could be quite modest compared to the second quarter.
<P>
The August Blue Chip survey of the economic consensus indicates that most American forecasters expect output growth to slow sharply by the fourth quarter.  In early August, the median forecast projected, 2.6% output growth during the third quarter, 2.1% during the fourth quarter, and 1.9% during the first quarter of 1997.  The ten most optimistic forecasters projected 3.3% growth during the third quarter and 2.9% during the fourth quarter.  The most pessimistic expected growth of only 1.8% and 1.1% during the final two quarters of 1996.

<P>
The Clinton administration should be pleased about the July
correction in U.S. equity prices.  The market has begun adjusting to the
growing likelihood of Federal Reserve tightening during August.  If the markets
had expected the Fed to remain passive, the risk would have increased of
investors becoming even more speculative than they were during the spring and
setting the stage for a dramatic stock market correction in the weeks before
the presidential election.  <i>Any Fed tightening during August will have only
a marginal effect on the economy this autumn whereas a repetition of the 1987
stock market crash would permit the Republicans to argue that the economy's
current prosperity is an illusion which will give way to recession next
year.</i><p>
<u></u><p>
While most of Wall Street is now prepared for a 25 basis point interest rate
hike this month, there continues to be considerable disagreement about the
economy's underlying strength.  As Alan Greenspan himself suggested in his
recent congressional testimony, there are good arguments for expecting final
demand growth to slow during the second half of 1996.  He said,<p>
<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
"...the support to economic growth provided by expenditures on durable goods,
both for household consumption and business fixed investment, is likely to wane
in coming quarters.  Consumer spending in the past few years has been boosted
as households have made up the purchases of big-ticket items that they had
deferred during the recession and the early, weaker phase of the recovery.
Five years after the business-cycle trough, however, we should expect that this
pent-up demand has been largely exhausted.  Moreover, many households have
built up sizable debt burdens in recent years, and coping with debt repayments
could hold down their spending.  The business sector has been adding
considerably to capacity; opportunities to invest profitably in new capital
should be increasing less rapidly as final demand slows some."</BLOCKQUOTE><p>
<p>
The problem for the Federal Reserve and investors is that the U.S. economy has
just completed an inventory sub-cycle lasting almost one year and is now poised
for a revival of stock-building.  The auto sector added about 1.0% to output
growth during the second quarter and will probably add another 0.5% during the
third quarter.  The GM strike shifted some auto output to the second quarter
while GM may build inventory during the third quarter in order to hedge against
strike risks in September  The non-auto manufacturing sector remained subdued
during the second quarter but should give a boost to output during the next few
quarters.  It is possible that the auto industry will create excess inventory
during the third quarter if there is no strike to consume it during September
but auto sales have been so responsive to price discounting that it should not
be difficult to reduce inventories quickly if the need arises.  <p>
<p>
<i>The economy's performance during the past year has been very comparable to
the gradual upturns which followed previous sub-cycles of slow growth resulting
from monetary tightening and inventory adjustments during the long expansions
of the 1960's and 1970's.</i>  Excluding weather driven disruptions of output
during January, the purchasing agent index reached a trough of 45.7 during
June, 1995 and rebounded to 54.3 during<p>
June, 1996 after fluctuating in a narrow range of 46.0-48.0 during recent
months.  The rebound in the purchasing agent index so far has been highly
comparable to the upturns which followed the slow growth sub-cycles of
1984-1985 and 1988-1989, but it has been much weaker than the recovery from the
slow growth sub-cycle of 1966-1967, when defense spending was buoyant. The
rebound in the stock market also has been very positive compared to the upturns
from previous slow growth sub-cycles.  The stock market has increased by 24%
since June, 1995 whereas during the upturn from the 1967 slowdown the gain was
only 5.0% and during the rebound from the 1989 slowdown the market declined.
<i>Monetary policy and inflation have been the critical determinant of equity
prices during all of the sub-cycles.</i>  In the late 1960's, the economy was
so overheated by the Vietnam War that monetary policy had to be tightened.  In
the 1989 sub-cycle, inflation had accelerated by enough that the Fed decided to
raise interest rates despite the sluggish growth of output.  In 1985, by
contrast, inflation was so subdued that interest rate declined and encouraged
equity prices to rise by 29% during the twelve months after the trough in the
purchasing agent index.<p>
<p>
The inflation environment today is analogous to the 1986 subcycle on the basis
of indicators such as the purchasing agent price index.  It is now about 50
compared to a trough of 40-45 twelve months ago and a peak of 70-80 two years
ago.  <i>But the level of unemployment today is 5.3% compared to an average of
7.2% during 1985.  As a result of the low level of unemployment, the major
concern of policy makers today is not industrial commodity prices but potential
upward pressure on wages.  As Chairman Greenspan noted in his recent
testimony,</i><p>
<p><blockquote>
"The economy is already producing at a high level -- and some early signs of
pressures on resources are emerging, especially in the labor market."</blockquote><p>
<u></u><p>
<u></u>The uptick occurring in the level of wage growth is not alarming but it
is clear that a change of trend is underway.  The wage component of the
Employment Cost Index is now rising at an annual rate of nearly 4.0% compared
to less than 3.0% during 1995 while benefits are rising at an annual rate of
close to 3.0%.  If this acceleration continues in response to another year of
low unemployment, the core U.S. inflation rate could approach 4.0% by late
1997.  The risk facing the corporate sector is that the Fed will attempt to
prevent rising wages from pushing up prices by dampening output growth,
depressing productivity, and creating a squeeze on profit margins.<p>
<p>
The level of unemployment is now below 4.0% in two regions accounting for 10.8%
of the national labor market (the upper mid west, the plains and rocky mountain
states).  It is below 5.0% in four other regions accounting for over 36% of the
national labor market (New England, the southeast, the middle west and the
border states).  It is in the 5.0-6.0% range in six other regions
(mid-Atlantic, Florida, the deep south, the oil patch, the southwest and the
Pacific northwest).  It is above 6.0% only in New York (6.6% of the national
labor market) and California (10.6% of the labor market).  <i>As both New York
and California are currently experiencing much stronger output growth than they
were one year ago, it is doubtful that their district presidents would oppose
proposals to tighten monetary policy from low unemployment districts such as
Kansas City, Chicago or Minneapolis.</i><p>
<u></u><p>
The major argument against tightening in the face of escalating wages is that
final demand growth will soon moderate and thus lessen the upward pressure on
the economy's resource utilization rates.  <p>
<p>
The growth rate of retail sales slowed during June and July after strong growth
during the spring.  The uptick in mortgage rates should start to cool the
housing market this autumn.  Companies, such as Hewlett Packard, have warned
that there will be a major slowdown in high technology capital spending during
the next twelve months.  The sharp uptick in credit card delinquency rates
could encourage some banks to impose tighter lending quality standards on their
credit card operations.  If low income households suddenly lose access to
cards, they could be forced to curtail their spending.  The inventory
restocking process in the U.S. corporate sector has already produced a large
rebound in the level of imports which will erode the economy's growth momentum
by expanding the trade deficit.<p>

<P>
Most American forecasters now accept that U.S. output growth during
the second quarter will be in the 3.5-4.5% range. The strength
of the May data for employment, production and retail sales has
eliminated any doubts about the economy's capacity to recover
from the inventory adjustment which dampened output growth during
much of 1995 and early 1996. The great controversies now center
on whether output growth can be sustained at a rate of 3.0% or
whether it will fade back to the 1.0-2.0% range which prevailed
during much of 1995.
<P>
The majority of forecasters continue to expect a slowdown because
they perceive the business cycle to be mature, the household sector
to be overleveraged, and the business sector to be losing momentum.
They also believe that the large rise in bond yields since January
will depress home sales and residential construction by the autumn.
The optimists believe that the private sector has far more resilience
and that there will be spurt in federal expenditures as government
agencies rush to spend discretionary funds provided by the recent
Congressional-White House budget agreement.
<P>
<B>The case for above trend U.S. growth during the second half
of 1996 has five major pillars.</B> 
<P>
First, consumer spending should benefit from steady growth of
employment, modest upward pressure on wages, buoyant balance sheets,
and the high level of confidence apparent in the household sector.
According to the early June survey of consumer confidence by the
University of Michigan, households are optimistic about both their
financial situation and the general business outlook. Such optimism
is not surprising in view of the recent revisions in the government's
survey of labor market condition. On the basis of the data which
was available before June 7th, the average monthly increase in
employment had been 116,000 for the past three months, 163,000
for the past six months, and 162,000 for the past twelve months.
<B>The new data has revised up the average monthly growth rate
of employment to 223,000 jobs for the past three months, 225,000
jobs for the past six months, and 195,000 jobs for the past twelve
months.</B> The 1995 employment growth rate also was revised up
to 185,000 jobs per month from 144,000 while 1994 was revised
up to 318,000 from 294,000. The wage data look stronger as well.
The three month and twelve month growth rates of wages are now
3.5% and 3.4% compared to 2.8% and 3.3% previously.
<P>
There are risks in the consumer outlook. Fluctuations in auto
discounts could produce large monthly swings in retail spending
on autos. Rising mortgage rates will probably dampen home sales
by the autumn. The sharp rise now occurring in delinquency rates
on credit card loans could ultimately encourage banks to promote
them less aggressively among low income people. But the strength
of employment growth and the uptrend now occurring in wages suggests
that the underlying growth rate trend of consumer spending will
be at least 2.5% during the next few quarters. While the lending
policies of the credit card sector should be monitored carefully,
the major banks report that the rise in delinquency rates will
not deter them from offering new cards to people earning less
that $30,000 per annum. As the bottom 20% of the U.S. population
accounts for only 5-6% of consumer spending, more careful rationing
of credit card access would also not produce a broad based slump
in consumer spending.
<P>
While the major factor boosting consumer confidence is the improved
labor market, it also should benefit from the recovery occurring
in the advertising industry and the real incomes of financial
journalists. Analysts project that domestic advertising outlays
will rise by 7.4% this year compared to nominal GDP growth of
only 5.0-6.0%. Such a healthy advertising environment will improve
the salaries and expense accounts of the business journalists
who influence household psychology through the tone of the news
stories which they write about the economy. When advertising is
in recession, journalists suffer real income losses which encourage
pessimistic news reporting about the economy. When the advertising
sector is prosperous, the real incomes of journalists improve
and thus reinforces the new mood of optimism about the economy.
<P>
The fluctuation in advertising expenditures during the 1990's
have been so large that they have become an important influence
on both the economy and public policy. Newspaper advertising fell
by 6-7% during 1990 -1991 and grew by only 1.0% during 1992. The
only previous contraction was a 0.2% decline in 1970 which was
followed by 8.1% growth during 1971. Television advertising declined
during 1991 for the first time ever in the post war era while
radio advertising declined for the first time since 1961. <B>Forecasters
do not ordinarily focus on advertising expenditures as a proxy
for consumer confidence but the fact is they are highly interdependent.</B>
If an advertising slump depresses the real incomes of the scribbling
classes, it influences the tone of media commentary about business
conditions and economic policy. <B>There also has been a good
correlation during recent years between newspaper advertising
expenditures and election results.</B> George Bush presided over
the greatest advertising recession of the post-war era. Ronald
Reagan won re-election in 1984 on the back of double digit growth
in advertising outlays. Jimmy Carter's defeat in 1980 coincided
with a collapse in the growth rate of advertising outlays to only
6.0-7.0% from 14-15% during the previous four years. Richard Nixon's
victory in 1972 coincided with a double digit spurt in advertising
outlays after two years of decline and slow growth. The Republicans
lost the White House to the Democrats in 1960 against a backdrop
of advertising expenditures slowing from double digit growth rates
in 1959 to only 4.4% during 1960 and a decline of over 2.0% during
1961. The only electoral contest which has run contrary to the
trend of advertising expenditures is the 1976 presidential election,
when Gerald Ford lost to Jimmy Carter despite an upturn in the
growth rate of advertising expenditures to 16.8% from 4.0-5.0%
during the previous two years.
<P>
The second pillar of the above trend growth scenario is the benign
outlook for business investment. Corporate profits should rise
by 10-12% this year. Capacity utilization rates in the manufacturing
sector have risen back to 82.0% from 81.3% in January while utilization
rates for the economy as a whole are at 83.2%. The ratio of stock
prices to asset replacement costs (Tobin's Q) is at the highest
level in post-war history. As result, <B>the corporate sector
is enjoying an unprecedented fund raising boom in the securities
markets. </B>During the first five months of 1996, there were
364 new equity I.P.O's raising $23.7 billion of capital compared
to 573 I.P.O.'s raising $28.9 billion last year and a previous
peak of 665 I.P.O.'s raising $34 billion during 1993. The market
for non-investment grade debt is also enjoying strong growth.
There were 92 non-investment grade bond offerings worth $17 billion
during the first five months of 1996 compared to 159 worth $28.7
billion last year and a peak of 343 worth $54.4 billion during
1993. <B>The bond market is producing less new financing than
the equity market because bond mutual funds are attracting far
less new money than equity mutual funds but the magnitude of non-investment
grade financing in the debt market is still the greatest since
the Drexel Burnham boom of the mid-1980's.</B> 
<P>
The third pillar of the strong growth scenario is that the economy
has recently experienced its greatest inventory adjustment since
the mid-1980's. Further growth of final demand will now require
faster growth of output. Non-farm inventories contracted at an
annul rate of $0.1 billion during the first quarter compared to
growth of $37.4 billion during 1995 and $46.8 billion during 1994.
In April, retail inventories rebounded at a 0.4% monthly rate
but the economy's inventory/sales ratio was still only 1.38 compared
to a peak of 1.41 during the second half of 1995. In the non-auto
retail sector, the I/S ratio was 1.36 compared to 1.39 during
the third quarter of 1995 while in the general merchandise sector
it was 2.23 compared to 2.33 during the fourth quarter of last
year. The weakness of output during the past year in sectors other
than computers and communications equipment suggests that there
could be a broad based upturn in the level of inventory accumulation
worth at least $30 billion during the second half of 1996.
<P>
The fourth pillar of the strong growth scenario is a resurgence
of discretionary federal spending after several months of fiscal
gridlock and temporary government shutdowns during the first two
quarters of the current fiscal year. Recent CBO studies project
that discretionary federal spending during fiscal 1996 will be
worth bout $535 billion. As a result of the government shutdown,
federal spending during the first seven months of the fiscal year
averaged only $510 billion at annual rates. <B>As a result, federal
agencies will have to spend at an annual rate of $570 billion
during the final five months of the fiscal year if they are to
achieve the CBO target.</B> There is no precise way to convert
such spending into the federal government components of the GDP
accounts but the pressure to spend suggests that real federal
expenditures will rise moderately during the third quarter compared
to widespread forecasts that they will decline at a 3.0-4.0% annual
rate. As a result of the recent congressional-White House disagreements
over fiscal policy, federal spending has been very volatile during
the current fiscal year. It fell at a 12.8% annual rate during
the fourth quarter of 1995 and then rebounded at an 8.5% annual
rate during the first quarter of 1996.
<P>
<B>The final pillar of the strong growth scenario is the upturn
now occurring in other G-7 countries, Latin America and China.</B>
If the U.S. economy can achieve 2.5-3.0% output growth this year,
the world economy should enjoy a growth rate in excess of 4.0%
for the first time since 1988. As the cyclical upturns in other
countries are just getting underway, the odds are high that global
output growth will remain above 4.0% next year as well. The recovery
in the world economy will not prevent an inventory induced upsurge
of imports from widening the U.S. trade deficit this summer but
it should cause improvement of the trade account to boost output
growth by at least 0.2-0.3% during 1997.

<P>
There are few better proxies for measuring economic and political
risk in the former Soviet Union than the interest rate differential
between Estonia and Russia.
<P>
After five years of independence, Estonia has achieved such a
remarkable economic transformation that her nominal short-term
interest rates are about 8% while her real interest rates are
a negative 10%.  In Russia, by contrast, there is so much investor
apprehension about the country's economic policies that nominal
interest rates are over 150% despite the fact that the Ruble has
been stable for nearly a year and inflation has declined to 30%.
<P>
Estonia's economic transformation is remarkable by the standards
of both the former Communist countries to her east and the socialist
Scandinavian economies to her west.  She is a nation of one million
Nordic people and one half million displaced Russians trying to
create a new Hong Kong on the edge of the old Soviet Union.  Her
policies are so unambiguously market oriented that she could soon
have the most open economy and smallest government sector of any
country on the European continent.
<P>
Estonia has no tariffs, no government deficit, no central government
debt, a flat rate income tax of 26% and a government expenditure
share of GDP equal to 27% or less than one half of the west European
average.  She also conducts her monetary policy through a currency
board which has made the Kroon convertible into the D-mark at
a fixed rate of eight to one.  As with the currency board regimes
in Hong Kong and Argentina, the expansion of Estonia's money supply
now depends upon the growth of foreign exchange reserves, not
just domestic economic conditions.  Since foreign investment in
Estonia has been expanding steadily, Estonian interest rates have
declined to negative levels despite the fact that she is running
a current account deficit equal to about 6% of GDP.  Foreign direct
investment as a share of GDP already exceeds 10%, a level which
is close to the record set by Singapore.
<P>
In the initial years after independence and the dismantling of
communism, official measures of Estonian economic output contracted
by over 40%.  But the output losses resulted from people reallocating
resources from sectors producing goods which no one wanted to
buy to sectors which reflected the economy's new openness.  In
the last year of the Soviet era, 62% of Estonia's output derived
from manufacturing, 17% from agriculture and 12% from services.
 Today, the service sector accounts for almost two thirds of GDP
while the manufacturing share has fallen to less than 25%.  As
a result of the speed of this restructuring, the economy is now
expanding at a 6% annual rate and unemployment is only 5.0%.
<P>
Estonia has enjoyed some unique advantages in creating a dynamic
service sector.  She is very close to Finland (one hour by hydrofoil)
and was able to attract nearly three million Finnish tourists
last year.  They come to see the medieval center of the capital,
Tallinn, as well as to shop for goods which sell at a discount
to prices in Helsinki.  While the two countries have always been
separate, their languages are very similar and Finnish companies
have been the largest foreign investors in Estonia.
<P>
The other great opportunity for Estonia's service sector is the
development of Tallinn as a major trans-shipment point for Russia
and other countries in the region.  Tallinn has one of the best
harbors on the Baltic Sea and could easily become a more important
port than St. Petersburg.  But Tallinn's future role could be
inhibited by the poor relations which exist between Russia and
Estonia.  In a recent poll of Russian popular attitudes about
which country is most hostile to Russia, the winner was Estonia.
 The Estonian ambassador to Moscow said the poll resultwas great
honor for such a small country, but the deep animosities lingering
from the Soviet era are a potential obstacle to Estonia achieving
its full potential as a new Hong Kong for the region.  Estonia
is such a small country that foreign companies will want to invest
there only if the country can serve as a warehouse and distributioncenter
for the whole Baltic region and eastern Russia, not just the local
market. The Estonians have much to learn from the Poles, who have
developed such successful relations with their former enemies
in both the east and west that exports are growing at a 35% annual
rate while cross border retail trade is worth over 5% of GDP.
 Estonia also has such a small population that her own industries
will someday need access to Russian labor in order to expand.
 If barriers to trade and capital can be removed, northeast Russia
could emerge as a low cost labor reserve for Estonia in much the
same way that the southern Chinese province of Guandong does for
Hong Kong.
<P>
Estonia is still in the midst of privatizing former state enterprises
and establishing the legal infrastructure of capitalism.  But
her greatest economic policy challenge during the next few years
will probably be managing the financial side-effects of the currency
board monetary regime on credit expansion and asset prices. Estonia's
Kroon was the first new currency to emerge from the former Soviet
Union and it was pegged at such a deeply undervalued level that
the exchange rate link to the D-mark has not undermined the country's
commercial competitiveness despite the large inflation differential
with Germany.  The only powerful protectionist lobby in Estonia
is the agricultural sector, which has been suffering from high
tariffs in both Russia and the European Union.  But with real
interest rates at minus 10% and the economy enjoying strong growth,
there is a risk that Estonia's currency board could encourage
speculative bank lending and a sharp rise in asset prices.  Under
a currency board monetary system, the sole goal of monetary policy
is to maintain a convertible currency at a fixed exchange rate.
 The central bank cannot manipulate interest rates in order to
fine tune the economy.  At present, both domestic and international
investors are very happy to purchase Kroon financial assets with
negative real interest rates because Estonian interest rates are
several hundred basis points above the yields available on D-mark
financial assets. The risk is that negative real interest rates
in an environment of high economic growth will encourage a burst
of speculative bank lending to finance inflation in real estate
prices and equity values.  The central bank will have to carefully
monitor credit quality in the banking system in order to prevent
a boom and bust cycle from occurring.  Estonia had a major banking
crisis in 1992 but that crisis resulted from loans to bankrupt
Soviet era state enterprises.  Today, the Estonian banking system
is so well capitalized that the some of its institutions are taking
advantage of Latvia's banking problems by expanding into that
country.
<P>
While Estonia's rate of economic growth is one of the highest
in the world, her standard of living is still suffering from the
lagged effects of fifty years of communism.  Before World War
Two, Estonia had a per capita income comparable to Finland's.
 Today, her per capita income is about $3,000 while Finland's
is $18.850.  If we adjust for price differences, the per capita
income of Estonia on a purchasing power parity basis is probably
over $6,000, but it is still far below its long term potential.
<P>
Estonia is such a small country that many pundits will probably
dismiss her success as the by-product of unique historical and
geo-political circumstances.  Despite a long period of Russian
domination by both the Czars and the Communists, Estonia's cultural
roots are in Scandinavia.  She was a member of the Hanseatic league
during the early middle ages and a province of the Swedish empire
until the 18th century.  Before 1939, her economy had consisted
of small farms and a wealthy class of German merchant families
who had emigrated to Tallinn during the Hanseatic era.  But the
fact remains that Estonia is creating such a dynamic free market
economy that she will soon appear to be an anomaly compared to
all of the countries of the Baltic, not just former Republics
of the Soviet Union.
<P>
When Mrs. Thatcher named her first cabinet in 1979, it had so
many people of eastern European descent that one media pundit
said it was unique for containing more Estonians than Etonians.
 In the early Thatcher years, Estonia was still a Soviet satellite
and no one could have imagined her serving as a role model for
any form of free market economic experiment.  But if Estonia can
manage the potential monetary risks in her Hong Kong style economic
policy mix, there is little doubt that she will emerge as an important
case study of the benefits of currency boards, free trade, and
low income tax rates for all developing countries and even her
Scandinavian neighbors.  Estonia's monetary system could also
serve as a useful tool for improving relations with Russia.  As
Mr. Yeltsin tries to re-establish the credibility of his economic
reform program, he could do no worse than to announce that the
Russian central bank will attempt to improve its anti-inflation
credibility by pegging the Ruble to the Estonian Kroon.

<P>
As a result of the strength of final demand and rundown of inventories
which occurred during the first quarter, the majority of American
forecasters will soon be projecting 3.0-4.0% output growth during
the second quarter.  The great unresolved question which still
hangs over the financial markets is whether final demand will
slacken again and cause output growth to dip back into the 1.0-2.0%
range during the third quarter or whether output growth will remain
in the 3.0-3.5% range as a result of robust capital investment,
steady expansion of retail sales and a burst of discretionary
federal spending during the closing months of the 1996 fiscal
year.  <B>The economy's performance during the third quarter will
be of critical importance to investor psychology this summer because
it will probably determine whether the Federal Reserve decides
to hike short-term interest rates.</B>  The Fed can avoid tightening
in response to one strong quarter because output growth has been
weak or erratic for over a year.  But with the unemployment rate
at 5.4%, inflation already under upward pressure because of  oil
and food price shocks, and the stock market seemingly oblivious
to all risks, it will be difficult to avoid at least one modest
monetary tightening  at either the early July or late August FOMC
meeting.
<P>
The American forecasting community expects the second quarter
to represent the growth peak of 1996 but there is no consensus
about the growth rate for the second half.  Pessimists believe
that the economy will loose growth momentum quickly because of
the adverse effect of higher oil and food prices on consumer real
income, the impact of rising bond yields on demand for housing
and a general slowdown in business fixed investment after two
years of robust gains.  There will probably also be a sharp rise
of imports and deterioration of the trade account because of inventory
restocking in many tradable goods sectors.
<P>
The growth optimists accept that retail spending will slow and
that the trade deficit will widen but they still project output
growth to remain in excess of 3.0% because of robust business
investment, steady growth of residential construction, a large
swing in corporate demand for inventories and a rebound in government
expenditures as federal agencies rush to spend unexpected appropriations
provided by the budget compromise announced a few weeks ago. 
Under the new budget, federal agencies will be able to engage
in $291 billion of discretionary spending during the April to
September period compared to $244 billion during the first half
of the current fiscal year.
<P>
<B>Several recent economic data reports have strengthened the
arguments of the optimists.</B>  The latest Manpower Employment
Survey is projecting a moderate uptick of employment growth during
the second quarter and is optimistic about the third quarter as
well.  In April, non-defense capital goods orders excluding aircraft
enjoyed their strongest growth rate in several months.  The recent
decline in oil prices suggests that consumer inflation will ease
during the summer while the year on year growth rate of the CPI
has run so far ahead of the consumption deflator that real household
income is not as weak as the CPI may suggest.  The resilience
of the stock market continues to boost household wealth and is
having positive spillover effects on sectors of the economy sensitive
to discretionary spending.  The government also appears to have
enjoyed a surprisingly large windfall in capital gains tax receipts
during April while America's charities report that personal contributions
to them rose by 11% last year or the highest growth rate since
1986.  Nor is the stock market boom just increasing household
wealth.  <B>It also is boosting investment and job creation by
increasing the flow of capital to entrepreneurial firms through
initial public offerings.  In the first half of 1996, IPO activity
appears likely to expand at a $60 billion annual rate compared
to $29.7 billion last year and a previous peak of $41.7 billion
during 1993.</B>
<P>
Despite the allegations of many economic commentators that Federal
Reserve policy is restrictive, the growth of IPO activity as well
as bank lending to small and medium sized companies makes it clear
that the overall financial environment is quite stimulative. 
Commercial banks enjoy strong balance sheets and are competing
to make new loans.  The mutual fund boom is encouraging an upsurge
in securitized capital formation through new stock and bond issues.
 Investors are more willing to assume risks because they have
enjoyed healthy capital gains on their existing equity portfolios.
 <B>In fact, the ratio of stock market capitalization to GDP has
itself expanded to 90.4% or the highest level ever recorded in
American history.</B>  The previous all time peak was 81% in 1929
and the post-war peak was 78% in 1972.  As a result of healthy
profit growth in the corporate sector since 1991, the stock market's
p/e multiple is still at moderate levels (16 using 1996 profits)
but the ratios of price to book value and price to replacement
cost (Tobin's Q) have risen to record levels.  Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan has downplayed the significance of these
ratios by stressing that book value cannot adequately measure
the impact of America's investment in technology and human capital
on potential corporate earnings power  but the fact remains that
firms are enjoying such rich valuation ratios that they have a
very strong incentive to boost investment.  <B>As a result, it
is not surprising that the most distinguishing feature of the
current business cycle has been its supply side dimension.</B>
 The economy enjoyed a healthy recovery after 1993 because of
an upsurge of capital investment which is causing the economy's
potential manufacturing capacity to expand at a 4.5% annual rate
compared to 2.0-2.5% in the early 1990's.  A recovery with such
strong investment leadership enjoys self-reinforcing momentum
because it boosts the economy's potential growth rate and thus
lowers the risk of inflation even as demand increases. The problem
for policy-makers is that official output data does not yet show
any productivity pay-off from the recent investment boom, so they
continue to perceive the economy's optimal growth rate to be only
about 2.0-2.5%.
<P>
There is not yet a consensus at the Federal Reserve on the need
to tighten monetary policy, but opinion will move in that direction
if May and June data confirm that final demand is expanding at
a steady rate and that the manufacturing sector is shifting from
a sub-cycle of inventory liquidation to accumulation.  Excluding
food and oil, the economy's inflation performance is still excellent
but if output growth remains above 3.0% through year end, the
unemployment rate will drop to 5.0% and provoke increasing anxiety
about the danger of increased pressure on wages and prices.  The
risk of tightening will fade only if there is such pronounced
weakness in retail sales that the FOMC can ignore the resilience
of other sectors or if there is a sudden precipitous correction
in equity prices.
<P>
Political factors could delay any new Fed tightening until August.
 The Senate has not yet been able to confirm the reappointment
of Alan Greenspan as Fed Chairman or the appointment of two new
Governors because of a filibuster by Senator Harkin of Iowa. 
The two new appointees may also be reluctant to launch their Fed
careers by tightening immediately.  But if third quarter growth
forecasts solidify in the 3.0-3.5% range, there will be at least
a 75% chance of monetary tightening at the August FOMC meeting.
<P>
<B>The other factor which could encourage U.S. monetary tightening
and depress bond markets this summer is the growing confidence
among forecasters that 1997 will be the most robust year for the
world economy since 1988.</B>  According to the latest IMF forecast,
world output should expand by 4.3% during 1998 compared to 3.8%
this year, 3.5% during 1995, and 1.5-2.4% during the early 1990's.
 As a result of its below consensus forecast of only 1.8% and
2.2% U.S. output growth during 1996 and 1997, the IMF is projecting
just 2.0% and 2.6% output growth in all the industrial countries
during this year and next year, but it expects output growth in
the developing countries to rise to 6.4% from 6.3% during 1995
and 5.9% during 1995.  The countries in transition from communism
also should enjoy growth rates of 2.5% and 3.8% during 1995 and
1996 compared to large output losses during the early 1990's.
  As the IMF is significantly undersestimating U.S. output growth,
the world economy should enjoy a growth rate in excess of 4.0%
this year and over 4.5% next year.
<P>
Most Wall Street people still view the world economy largely from
the perspective of the G-7 countries but the fact is they now
account for only about 55% of world output compared to 40% for
the developing countries and 5% for the transition economies.
 As a result of the high growth differentials between the developing
countries and industrial countries, the  G-7 share of world output
will decline steadily during the next decade.  The fact is the
developing countries have about 70% of the world's land area and
85% of its population compared to 45% of its output and 15% of
its stock market capitalization.  The gaps between human resources
and output should decline significantly as the developing countries
continue their transition to market oriented economic systems.

<P>



The major risk now confronting the U.S. financial markets is that bond yields will rise sharply in response to both evidence of economic recovery and the increasingly populist tone of the 1996 election campaign.  <B>Most forecasters have clearly underestimated the U.S. economy's resilience while congressional Republicans are so alarmed about their low standing in the opinion polls that they have decided to counter-attack by proposing an immediate reduction in the gasoline tax</B>.  If the bidding war in Washington continues to escalate, investors will become concerned about expansion of the federal deficit and enactment of new regulatory entitlements, such as a higher minimum wage, at a time when the demand for labor is already starting to encourage faster wage growth.
<P>

The overall cyclical condition of the U.S. economy is the best since the 1960's, but there is widespread dissatisfaction with perceived changes in the composition of national income.  The profit share of GDP is still well below its peak in the 1950's and 1960's, but  many people believe that the post-1991 economic expansion has benefited only a small elite of senior executives and stockholders, not the great mass of the American people.  As a result the U.S. economy will be caught between two colliding forces this summer; a bond market which distrusts output growth in excess of 2.0% and a bidding competition in Washington to redistribute income at the expense of corporate profits and the federal deficit.
<P>

Since perceptions are reality in both the bond market and politics, bond investors must now confront a perplexing dilemma.  
<P>

If they start to discount a robust economy and Democratic takeover of  the Congress, bond yields will rise so sharply that the economy could stall this autumn and help set the stage for a Dole victory.  In such a scenario, bond yields could drop from 8.0% this summer back to 5.5% next year.  If, by contrast, bond yields peak close to 7.0% or soon decline, the economy will lose momentum only gradually and the odds of  Democratic victories in November will improve.  If the Democrats regain control of the Congress, bond yields will remain in the 6.5-7.5% range in late 1996 even if output growth slows to 1.5-2.0%.
<P>

Election campaigns always encourage politicians to make promises about the economy which they regret later, <B>but the stakes in the 1996 election are unprecedented in the modern era</B>.  No Democratic President has won two consecutive election victories since Franklin Roosevelt.  The Republicans have not controlled the Congress for two consecutive terms, since the days of Calvin Coolidge and Herbert Hoover.  As a result, both parties perceive great opportunities and risks in the current election.  The President has done a masterful job of borrowing much of the Republican rhetoric about reducing the size of government while playing upon the theme of economic insecurity through populist proposals, such as boosting the minimum wage.  As is apparent with his stands on Tort Reform and the balanced budget, <B>he is remarkably adept at shifting between the imagery of a New Democrat and an Old Democrat on an issue-by-issue basis</B>.  In fact, a recent media search by The New York Times found that President Clinton did not refer to the minimum wage once when his party controlled the Congress, but he has endorsed a minimum wage hike nearly fifty times since the Republicans took over the Congress in early 1995.
<P>

The minimum wage has fallen so sharply in real terms since the 1980's that an increase will pose only modest risks for employment creation, but the markets regard it as a bad omen of the policies which could follow in 1997 if the Democrats win back control of the Congress.  As a result, it is not surprising that Dr. Al Wojinlower refers to the current American economic scene as one of "glum prosperity".
<P>

The U.S. economy expanded at a 2.8% annual rate during the first quarter compared to wide-spread expectations that output growth would be only 1.5-2.0%.  Domestic final sales rose at a 4.1% annual rate compared to 0.6% during the fourth quarter of 1995, 2.6% during the third quarter, and 2.2% during the second quarter.  The uptick in domestic final sales was led by a 14.5% growth rate in business spending on new equipment, 5.8% growth in business spending on structures, and 3.5% growth in consumer spending.  After falling steadily for several quarters, federal government spending also rebounded at a 6.7% annual rate compared to a 12.8% decline during the fourth quarter.  As a result of auto inventory liquidation, non-farm business inventories grew at only a $12.8 billion annual rate compared to $19.5 billion during the fourth quarter of 1995, $36 billion during the middle quarters of 1995, and $54.5 billion during the first quarter of 1995.  If we exclude autos, though, real business inventories rose at a $36.9 billion annual rate last quarter compared to $19.1 billion during the fourth quarter of 1995 and $44.5 billion during the third quarter.
<P>

<B>The underlying strength of domestic final demand suggests that the economy should continue to expand at a 3.0-3.5% annual rate through the middle quarters of 1996</B>.  There will be renewed weakness in federal spending during the second quarter and inventory rebuilding will boost the trade deficit, but steady growth of private final demand, coupled with a swing in the corporate inventory cycle, should still produce output growth in excess of 3.0%.
<P>

The best confirmation that the inventory cycle has turned is the purchasing agent index.  It rose back over 50 in April, or its highest level since June, 1995, in response to stronger orders, output, and backlogs.  The April employment report was weak after hefty job gains during the first quarter, but some of this weakness appears to reflect seasonal problems with the timing of the survey.  The April Conference Board survey of consumer perceptions of the job market was much more upbeat.  Only 21.3% of households reported that jobs were hard to get compared to 26.5% during March and 23.4% during February.
<P>

<B>The economy's surprising resilience during the first quarter has already provoked a new debate about when the Fed might feel compelled to tighten monetary policy again</B>.  It is doubtful that the Fed will want to move as early as its late May meeting, but some analysts are now speculating about a rate hike in July or one year after the Fed first began easing policy in response to the 1995 slowdown.
<P>

There is no consensus at the Fed about when to act because there are as many divisions about the economic outlook on the FOMC as there are in the private sector.  Some governors perceive that the economy is structurally vulnerable to weakness because of the high level of consumer debt, while the majority perceive that the economy is expanding at a moderate non-inflationary rate.  They will not want to tighten until they see clear signs that output growth will remain above 2.5% on a sustained basis and push utilization rates to levels which might encourage higher inflation.
<P>

The evidence on the inflation outlook itself is mixed.  There have been large price increases for food and fuel during recent weeks because of exogenous shocks, such as poor weather and low inventories.  Such price shocks are occurring independently of the global business cycle, but they could alter the inflation outlook if they began to influence corporate price and wage behavior.
<P>

Traditional cyclical measures of inflation pressure, such as the purchasing agent price index, are still subdued, but if the output growth remains close to 3.0% they are bound to revive in the near future.  The first quarter employment cost index report also contained the first hints of wage escalation in the U.S. economy.  Wages and salaries in the private sector rose at a 3.3% annual rate compared to gains of only 2.8-2.9% during the previous four quarters.  The uptick in wages was partly offset by slower growth of benefits after a long period in which benefit costs exceeded wage gains.  <B>But with the unemployment rate at 5.4%, the risk is high that wages will continue to escalate because of business competition for labor</B>.
<P>

As a result of  the low level of surplus capacity in the U.S. economy, there is clearly a case for monetary tightening as early as the July FOMC meeting, but there will not be a consensus on the FOMC for action without evidence that output growth will be sustained at a level above 2.5% and that industrial commodity prices are rising.  If the purchasing agent price index shoots up to 50% or higher during the next two months, and the Blue Chip Survey of the economic consensus projects a new median forecast of 3.0-3.5% output growth through the second half, the Fed is virtually certain to hike money market yields 25 basis points in July.  But if the purchasing agent price index is still in the 40-45 range and forecasters remain ambiguous about the growth outlook, the Fed could defer a decision until later in the summer.

<P>



  The performance of the U.S. financial markets during the next few quarters will be driven by the interaction between business cycle developments and the unfolding of  the 1996 election campaign. Monetary policy will be expansionary in most G-7 countries, but bond yields could fluctuate in a wide range because of changing investor perception of political and economic risk.  

<P>

  The large rise in U.S. bond yields since January suggests the market already is discounting several developments, including a moderate upturn in the economy, no further progress in resolving the fiscal deadlock in Washington, and a high probability of President Clinton winning re-election. European bond yields have risen partly in response to U.S. developments and partly because of investor apprehension about how the governments of Germany and France will resolve the contradictions in their program for European monetary union. Japanese bond yields have risen because of continuing evidence that the Japanese economy has bottomed as well as investor concern about the cost of future bank bail-outs on the government's fiscal deficit.  

<P>

  The uptick in bond yields during February and March was so sudden that some pundits began to make comparisons with the bond market collapse of 1994, but <B>it is doubtful that the cyclical revival in the U.S. economy this spring and summer will be as robust as the upturn which pushed U.S. bond yields over 8.0% two years ago.</B> In 1994, the economy enjoyed a spurt to 3.5% output growth from 2.2% because of 3.0% growth in personal consumption, 9.2% growth in business fixed investment and an inventory swing worth 0.6% of GDP. In 1996, the economy will probably enjoy 2.4% growth in consumer spending, 5.0-6.0% growth in business investment, and a stabilization of corporate inventories. But while output growth for the year as a whole will probably average only 2.5%, there could be a spurt to growth rates as high as 3.0- 3.5% during the second and third quarter, as the manufacturing sector shifts from inventory liquidation to inventory accumulation.  

<P>

  The 1994 rebound in the economy produced a large rise in capacity utilization rates and industrial commodity prices, so the Federal Reserve hiked U.S. short-term interest rates from 3.0% to 6.0%. If the coming rebound in output stabilizes with growth rates of 2.0-2.5% after one or two moderately stronger quarters, it will not have as dramatic an impact on commodity prices as the 1994 upturn. Capacity utilization rates have dropped back to 82.0% from 85.0% last year while new capacity is expanding at a 4.0% annual rate compared to only 2.0-2.5% during the early 1990's. There is a risk that the low level of unemployment will encourage some escalation of wage growth but the flexibility of the U.S. labor market will probably cause changes in wage compensation to occur gradually. <B>Unemployment has been at 4.0% in several mid-western states since 1994 and firms have still been successful at restraining costs.</B> In 1996, productivity also should improve as output growth recovers.  

<P>

  It is possible that the coming turn in the inventory cycle could produce such large income gains that consumer spending will rise sharply rather than moderately, but several factors suggest that the economy does not have the pent-up demand which existed after three years of sluggish growth between 1991 and 1994. The ratio of consumer debt to income has risen sharply and consumer delinquency rates on credit cards are back at the highs of 1990. While the delinquency rate on the total stock of consumer debt remains very subdued, <B>the uptick in the delinquency rate on cards could encourage some consumer finance companies to impose tighter credit standards after a prolonged period in which lending conditions became progressively easier.</B> As Federal Reserve Governor Larry Lindsey has warned, such a change in the credit environment could reduce the spending power of lower middle class households who lack discretionary income. The potentially new positive factor for consumer spending is the huge wealth gains which the household sector has enjoyed from the appreciation of equity prices. The capitalization of the U.S.- equity market has risen to $6.7 trillion or 87.5% of GDP compared to a seventy year average of 48% of GDP. Households own about two-thirds of all U.S. corporate equity, with one-third held in the form of mutual funds, IRA's, or defined benefit pension plans and two-thirds owned directly. Econometric research shows only a weak link between aggregate consumer spending and stock market gains because about 90% of U.S. corporate equity is owned by less than 5% of the households. But the capital gains of the past year have been so large that they should encourage healthy growth of demand for upmarket consumer goods as well as stronger retail spending in states with large concentrations of retired people, such as Florida. In 1992, households over the age of 65 owned 41.4% of publicly traded U.S. corporate equity despite the fact that they account for only 21.8% of all households. Households in the 45-54 year range, by contrast, own 18.07% of all U.S. equity and account for 16.42% of the population. It is popular in the investment community to describe senior citizens as people living on fixed incomes, but the spectacular performance of the stock market compared to real wages during recent years suggests that this label is misapplied. In the 1990's, it is people in their 20's and 30's, not the elderly, who are living on fixed incomes.  

<P>

  <B>If the rebound in the economy this spring does not push the purchasing agent index for inflation and other sensitive measures of industrial prices sharply higher, the Federal Reserve will probably permit short-term interest rates to remain at current levels through the summer and autumn.</B> It might decide to tighten in late 1996 if stronger growth in the world economy threatens to give a significant boost to commodity prices but the recovery in Europe and Japan is so weak that it will probably not generate major pressure on commodity prices until 1997. In contrast to U.S. industry, the European corporate sector has not yet reduced inventories significantly while final sales remain weak. Japan enjoyed healthy growth of final sales during the final quarter of 1995, but inventory levels are high and the government has not yet completed enactment of a rescue program for the banks. Large tax hikes are also scheduled for 1997. It should be noted as well that the bank rescue program now before the Japanese Diet is focused solely on the 8 trillion yen of bad debt in the Jusen. There are numerous other non-bank financial intermediaries with problem loans approaching 40 trillion yen.

<B>A Memo From David Hale</B>

<P>

A preliminary version of the coming White House report on social security reform is available by calling Debbie Hamilton at 312-499-1760.  It contains proposals for radical changes in the investment policies of the social security system.  Among the alternatives mentioned are investing social security funds directly in the equity market or turning over the assets for deployment in individually controlled retirement accounts.  There was no consensus in the study group taskforce about how to proceed, so this report will not lead to any immediate legislative proposals.  But after the 1996 elections there could be significant changes in the social security system's investment policies with potentially benign consequences for the mutual fund industry.

<P>

The yield on long-term U.S. Treasury bonds has increased by nearly 40 basis points since early January despite Fed easing and continued evidence of sluggish economic growth in the United States. <B>The steepening of the yield curve reflects a variety of economic and political developments.</B> Retailers have reported a stronger tone to consumer spending since January and thus the risk of the fourth quarter slowdown evolving into a recession has been greatly reduced. The weakness of Senator Robert Dole in the early primaries has lowered the odds of any new breakthrough in the budget talks in Washington while the success of Patrick Buchanan has provoked new anxieties about the ability of the Republicans to retain their congressional majorities in this autumn's election. The yen has rallied sharply because of Japanese corporations repatriating capital at the end of the March fiscal year and increasing evidence that the Japanese economy has stabilized. While the European economy is clearly weak, German investors are demanding increased yield premiums to compensate for the risk that Chancellor Kohl and President Chirac will pursue monetary union despite the failure of both countries to achieve the Maastricht targets for reduction of their government deficits. <B>The only clearly positive news for the bond market during the past week was the decision of President Clinton to re-appoint Alan Greenspan as Fed Chairman as well as to fill the existing vacancies with competent and credible economists widely perceived to have mainstream views about the role of the Federal Reserve in economic policy.</B>
<P>



The failure of the White House and Congress to agree on a fiscal package has been a major disappointment to investors because in the autumn of 1995 there appeared to be an unprecedented opportunity for long-term deficit reduction through cuts in Medicare entitlement programs. If the Republicans retain control of Congress, there will be a second opportunity to pursue some form of deficit reduction in 1997 but forecasts about next year's fiscal policy are speculative at best. The most popular Republican presidential candidates so far have been Steve Forbes and Patrick Buchanan, neither of whom has stressed balancing the budget as a policy priority. Ironically, if they force the Republican Party to adopt a more populist fiscal policy of tax cuts and increased federal spending to promote job security, President Clinton could emerge as the champion of fiscal conservatism this autumn. <B>The primary consolation for the bond market from this year's budget gridlock is that the Republicans will probably be able to impose $10-15 billion of targeted spending cuts in the continuing resolutions still moving through Congress and thus lower the fiscal 1996 deficit to $120-130 billion.</B>
<P>



While investors have long been apprehensive about the ability of a man as old as Senator Robert Dole to be an effective presidential candidate, the fragmentation of the Republican Party in the early primary elections has still come as a shock to the financial markets. It creates several potential risks. First, the Republican Party could become so badly divided that it will lose control of the Congress this autumn, not just the opportunity to regain the White House. Secondly, the issue of deficit reduction has faded completely from the political debate because of the popularity of Steve Forbes and Patrick Buchanan. Forbes is running on Reaganite themes, such as cutting taxes, while Buchanan is campaigning against free trade and an unregulated labor market. The candidate most closely identified with the Congressional Contract with America, Senator Phil Gramm, was the first to drop out. Thirdly, investors are apprehensive that Buchanan's successes will encourage other candidates to move in a populist direction by advocating more restrictive trade policies or large increases in marginal income tax rates to punish highly paid executives responsible for job shedding at large corporations. Senator Robert Dole has some advisors sympathetic to Buchanan's positions on trade and they have already encouraged him to make speeches attacking the American corporate sector. <B>If the Democrats were to regain control of the House, Rep. Richard Gephardt would become the House speaker and probably use his new position to develop a Democratic version of the Buchanan agenda for his own presidential campaign in 2000.</B>
<P>



Patrick Buchanan is such a divisive candidate that it will be impossible for him to win the Republican nomination, but his primary victories are exposing the social contradictions in America's recent economic performance and thus provoking a debate about income distribution, corporate responsibility, and other issues which the Republicans are often uncomfortable discussing.
<P>



<B>The U.S. economy has significantly out-performed all other industrial countries in job creation since the 1970's.</B> During the past sixteen years, the U.S. economy has created 28 million new jobs and reduced its unemployment rate to 5.7% while the unemployment rate in many European countries is twice as high. The ratio of long-term unemployed (unemployed longer than one year) to total unemployment is also only 12% in the U.S. compared to 40% in Germany and 35% in France. During the half century since the end of the Second World War, the U.S. economy has produced an expansion of private affluence on a scale unprecented since the industrial revolution began. In 1950, fewer than one million Americans earned as much as $60,000 in today's money. By 1967, slightly more than one million Americans had incomes of $100,000 per annum on the basis of 1993 constant dollars. Despite the volatile business cycles of the 1970's and early 1980's, this number expanded to 2.7 million by 1980 and to 5.6 million by 1993. In fact, over one million Americans had incomes above $200,000 per annum by 1993. <B>But the price of this flexibility has been an increase in job insecurity and erosion in the real wages of less skilled workers since the 1970's.</B> 
<P>



The U.S. economy has out-performed all other industrial countries in job creation during recent years because it enjoys far more price and regulatory flexibility in its labor market than other countries. Almost 20 million Americans change their job every year and even during the recession of the early 1990's only about 3 million did so because of employment termination. American firms are far more willing to hire than European firms because the cost of layoffs is much lower than in Europe.
<P>



According to a recent research report from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, the duration of jobs for most categories of American workers has been remarkably stable since 1973. But there has been a major increase in the rate of permanent dismissals at companies compared to temporary layoffs. In the 1960's, permanent dismissals accounted for only about 30-35% of new unemployment compared to 40-45% in 1993. The share of temporary layoffs, by contrast, has declined from just over 20% to about 17%.
<P>



<B>Job insecurity has been an especially striking feature of employment at the large Fortune 500 companies which were once considered to be the country's most stable employers.</B> Since 1979, their total employment has declined from 16.5 million jobs to 11.5 million jobs, with most of the job losses occurring in the U.S. itself. The growth of small and medium sized firms has provided many alternative forms of employment but some workers have had to accept lower pay when making such transitions. Start-up firms have much higher failure rates than old established companies and thus contribute to the sense of insecurity among people leaving job at large firms.
<P>



Patrick Buchanan alleges that U.S. firms have been transferring jobs to foreign countries in pursuit of lower wages but employment data for U.S. multinationals suggests that the technological factors which have forced cuts in U.S. manufacturing employment have been operative in other countries as well. <B>Between 1979 and 1989, American firms reduced their employment of foreign production workers by 2.3 million jobs while creating 1.2 million new jobs in non-production departments, such as marketing and distribution.</B> The expansion of U.S. companies in foreign markets is making them more formidable global competitors and thus boosting U.S. exports. It is not merely transferring jobs between countries on a zero sum basis.
<P>



<B>The introduction of new and more sophisticated forms of technology into the workplace has also produced greater income inequality based on education.</B> Since 1979, the real wages of high school graduates have fallen by 21% while the earnings of people with advanced technical degrees have often increased significantly. Firms also have tried to help their employers avoid high effective marginal tax rates by expanding benefits more aggressively than wage and salary income. During the past fifteen years, the government's employment cost index has increased by about 22.0% in real terms while real average hourly earnings have fallen by 8%. The biggest gains in employment costs were concentrated in benefits (up 38% in real terms), not take-home pay. Benefits have expanded from 16% of compensation in the early 1980's to over 18.0% today. As a result, workers which are employed by small firms without non-taxable benefit packages have suffered a much greater erosion of real income than people employed by firms with health care, pensions, and other non-taxable forms of compensation.

<P>

The U.S. dollar has eased against both the Japanese yen and German mark since January because of a mixture of economic and political factors.
<P>

<B>First, there are signs that the U.S. investors are exporting capital aggressively again.</B> In January, retail investors purchased almost $8 billion of international funds or the highest level since early 1994. If these trends were to be sustained, total capital outflows from the U.S. during 1996 could rise to $150-200 billion at annual rates. During 1995, U.S. investors purchased foreign equities at a rate of $4.1 billion during the first quarter, $10.2 billion during the second quarter, and $21.5 billion during the third quarter compared to $47 billion during 1994 and $63 billion during 1993. American demand for foreign bonds also has been expanding. In 1995, U.S. investors purchased foreign bonds at a rate of $3.8 billion during the first quarter, $12.7 billion during the second quarter and $13.8 billion during the third quarter. Pension capital outflows have been steady at about $35 billion per annum during recent years but retail investment demand for foreign securities has fluctuated in a wide range.
<P>

In 1995, the growing U.S. demand for foreign securities was offset by foreign purchases of American securities by both private and official investors. Foreign investors bought U.S. equities at a rate of $5.8 billion during the second quarter and $5.2 billion during the third quarter after selling $3.5 billion during the first quarter. Foreign investors were much more enthusiastic buyers of U.S. Treasury bonds last year. Their purchases were $32.9 billion during the first quarter, $43.5 billion during the second quarter, and $46.9 billion during the third quarter. A large share of these purchases were probably official intervention to support the dollar. Japan, for example, purchased $31.4 billion of U.S. government securities during the first three quarters of 1995 despite a cautious attitude towards the dollar by Tokyo's big life insurance companies. But the U.S. bond market rally also attracted many foreign buyers to corporate bonds, not just government securities. Foreign purchases of U.S. corporate bonds were $14.4 billion during the first quarter, $13.1 billion during the second quarter, and $13.2 billion during the third quarter. The problem for the U.S. capital account during 1996 is that American equity values are high relative to the rest of the world while the U.S. bond market is unlikely to produce returns as attractive as those which occurred during 1995. <B>There is also far more human and organizational infrastructure on Wall Street promoting foreign investment than ever before in American history.</B> The U.S. now has 367 international equity funds compared to 196 in 1993, 95 in 1990, and only 13 in 1984. The number of global equity funds has also expanded to 167 from 99 in 1992 and 16 in 1984. While global bond funds have attracted less money than international equity funds, their number also has expanded to 145 from 87 in 1992 and only 1 in 1984. As a result of the growth of America's international fund management industry and the significant out-performance of Wall Street compared to many foreign markets during recent years, American demand for foreign securities during 1996 could be much higher than foreign private demand for U.S. securities.
<P>

The second factor which has depressed the dollar during recent weeks has been seasonal repatriation of capital to Japan and investor concerns about the Bank of Japan shifting away from its easy monetary policy. The new finance minister recently stated that the yields on pensioners' bank deposits were excessively low. New data for industrial production and retail sales also suggest that the Japanese economy has bottomed and begun to recover. As a result of these developments, the futures market is now suggesting that the Bank of Japan could raise short-term interest rates this summer despite the severe asset quality problems of many Japanese banks. The slump in interest rates futures and rally in the yen has become self-reinforcing during recent weeks by encouraging many foreign borrowers of yen, such as hedge funds, to reduce their yen liabilities. As a result, the Bank of Japan has intervened on a large scale during recent weeks in order to persuade investors that they will not permit the seasonal pressures for a stronger yen to go too far.
<P>

<B>As a result of the problems of the Japanese banking system, it is very doubtful that there will be any new monetary tightening in the near future but the yen could still hold in a trading range of 103 to 107 because of political factors, not just divergences in monetary cycles and business conditions.</B> In January, U.S. manufacturing firms began to complain about dollar appreciation while the primary victories of Patrick Buchanan are reviving political focus on the trade deficit after a period in which it faded from Washington radar screens. Recent Japanese import and export data are also calling into question how much further the trade surplus will contract if the yen stays in a range of 100-110. Many Japanese firms are profitable at yen rates of 100-110 and their exports would probably rise sharply if the yen fell back to 110-120. As recently as three months ago, by contrast, many analysts were suggesting the trade surplus would fall sharply if the yen simply held at 105 to the dollar. Persistence of a large Japanese trade surplus is potentially bullish for world financial markets because it provides a source of surplus liquidity but the yen will not weaken dramatically if the surplus remains at high levels or expands further unless Japanese investors export capital far more aggressively. Japanese investors have been boosting their purchases of Australian and European bonds during recent months but they continue to be cautious towards the dollar. Recent political developments in the U.S. will probably reinforce this caution, especially if Mr. Buchanan goes into the Republican convention with a third or more of the delegates.
<P>

The third factor which has depressed the dollar is global bond yield differentials. The German mark has rallied against the dollar because German bond yields have backed up as much as U.S. bond yields during recent weeks while the German economy is so weak that most investors expect further Bundesbank easing. At present, Germany is offering nominal bond yields of 6.2% with a prospective inflation rate of 1.5-2.0% while U.S. bond yields are 6.4% despite a prospective inflation rate closer to 3.0%. French and British real long-term interest rates are also 4.0-5.0% on the basis of current bond yields and prospective inflation performance. These yield differentials have helped to boost investor demand for European currencies.
<P>

In the second quarter, several factors could help to encourage stronger demand for the dollar.
<P>

First, the U.S. economy should improve and lessen investor concern about the risk of a recession depressing corporate profits.
<P>

Secondly, the repatriation of capital to Japan should slow, if not reverse, while many investment institutions may respond to the start of the new fiscal year by diversifying more of their portfolios into foreign securities. Recent proposals to shift a large share of pension fund assets to non-life insurance company managers also should set the stage at some point for larger capital outflows from Japan.
<P>


Thirdly, European currencies could suffer during the second quarter from investor concern about the Russian presidential election in June. The opinion polls suggest that the most likely winner is the communist candidate, Mr. Gennady Zyuganov. He has tired to reassure foreign investors that he will not reverse recent economic reforms but most Russian liberals believe that he is a front man for members of the old Nomenklatura who will do significant damage to Russia's emerging market economy. Mr. Zyuganov's party also favors restoring stronger links with the former Republics of the Soviet Union and opposing the entry of the countries of eastern Europe into NATO. As the IMF recently provided Mr. Boris Yeltsin with a $9 billion loan and he still controls the machinery of government, it is possible that he will be able to make a comeback in time for the election. But as a result of his health problems and low level of public approval, investors will have to assign a high risk to the probability of either Mr. Zyuganov winning the election or Mr. Yeltsin inventing some political excuse to delay the election (such as new military action in the Chechen Republic or a sudden decision to merge Belarus back into Russia). The first major test of market perceptions of the Russian political situation will come in April when Morgan Guaranty plans to offer a Russian Eurobond to foreign investors. If the Eurobond offering goes well, the foreign exchange market may conclude that investors are already discounting a Zyuganov victory. But as Russia has not had an open election for its head of state since 1613, it is difficult to believe that the coming presidential election will not produce some news events potentially damaging to the currencies of the countries close to Russia, including the German mark.
<P>

<B>To summarize,</B> the large rise in U.S. bond yields since late January appears to reflect a mixture of economic and political factors, including the decreased risk of a full scale recession, new pessimism about the prospects for a fiscal compromise in Washington and investor anxiety about what fragmentation of the Republican Party in recent primaries portends for this November's presidential and congressional elections. Investors are especially concerned that Patrick Buchanan's success could help to set the stage for the election of a Democratic House majority which would then embrace themes such as economic nationalism and greater federal regulation of the labor market. The firmer tone to retail sales since January suggests the U.S. economy should soon complete its inventory adjustment and return to a growth rate of 2.0-3.0% during the second quarter. But if bond yields continue to rise in response to America's new political risks, the upturn in housing could stall and depress consumer spending on furniture and appliances at a time when fiscal policy will be restrictive and monetary policy will be the primary engine for restoring growth. Rising bond yields also could depress equity prices after a market rally so broad based that U.S. corporations now have a market capitalization of $6.6 trillion or a level equal to 87.5% of GDP compared to a previous peak of 81.0% of GDP in 1929.

<I>Will Investors Or The Government Benefit From Inflation Adjusted Treasury Bonds? (continued)</I><BR>

<P><BR>
The need for state and local governments to play a greater role combating the
causes of America's new income inequality at a time when the federal government
is promoting devolution of other programs suggests that governors and
legislatures are going to face more formidable challenges during the decade
ahead than at any other time in the modern era.  Their policies in sectors such
as education will not simply affect the economy of their state.  They will also
have a major impact on the wage and employment trends which are driving the
national debate about trade policy, tax policy and federal regulation of the
labor market.  Indeed, it would not be an exaggeration to say that the struggle
over America's place in the new global economic order will depend as much on
the policies of state governments as the national government.<p>
<p>
The strength of the national economy and the growth of tax receipts should
permit state governments to manage these challenges during 1996 and 1997.  But
when the U.S. economy experiences another recession, state governments will
have to confront the triple challenge of faltering tax receipts, increased
spending on the unemployed and the impact of new federal block grant system on
the capacity of Washington to help them fund social programs.  In such a
scenario, the deficits of state governments could rise sharply and force them
to curtail spending on capital investment and other services, including
education.<p>
<p>
How will state governments cope with the fiscal hazards posed by devolution and
recession during the late 1990's?  There will be no simple answers because the
U.S. no longer enjoys a broad social consensus about the role of government at
either the federal or state level.  But one obvious solution which could appeal
to both the political left and right would be for state governments to raise
money by privatizing various assets which could be operated more effectively by
the private sector.<p>
<p>
During the past decade, privatization has been a dominant theme for economic
reformers in both the old industrial countries and the developing countries.
The British government privatized its utilities, water systems and airports
during the 1980's.  China, Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines are
encouraging the private sector to develop an extensive network of toll roads.
Many Asian countries are also privatizing ports, electric systems, and phone
companies.  Argentina privatized its utility companies during the early 1980's
and is about to privatize its water companies.  In the U.S. private companies
supply about 85% of electricity but the public sector still owns practically
all of the airports and waterworks.  Toll roads played an important role in
America's early infrastructure development but today they account for only
about ten percent of the national highway system.  In 1994, toll roads
collected about $4.6 billion of revenue compared to $71.4 billion of government
receipts from highway user taxes. While it is difficult to put a precise value
on state and local government enterprises, the Reason Foundation has produced a
report suggesting they have a potential market value of about $227 billion.<p>
<p>
A few cities, such as Indianapolis, have promoted the privatization of public
services on the grounds of efficiency but the overall rate of change in the
U.S. has been very modest compared to other industrial countries because state
and local governments have not been confronting fiscal problems on a scale
large enough to require dramatic action. The U.S. federal tax system also
subsidizes public ownership of enterprises, such as airports and water systems,
by permitting state and local governments to sell tax exempt securities.<p>
<p>
Despite the great policy changes occurring in Washington today, state and local
governments enjoy a healthy financial position as a result of both the
economy's benign performance and the large increase in federal assistance which
occurred during the Bush administration.  But they should not permit their
current surpluses to lull them into complacency about the challenges which lie
ahead.<p>
<p>
If the Republicans retain control of Congress, there will be continuing
pressure to lower the federal deficit through reduced financial assistance to
the states.  If they win the White House, the odds would also increase of a
dramatic overhaul of the federal tax system which could jeopardize existing tax
allowances, such as the exemption on state and local government securities, as
a quid pro quo for reducing marginal income tax rates. If the Democrats win,
they will move more slowly to curtail federal spending but they will also be
unable to resist the demographic pressure for cuts in discretionary spending
programs over the long-term.  Devolution and the movement towards block grants
will be manageable for the states during periods of economic growth but when
the economy finally experiences a recession, they will have to finance large
increases in social spending without the support which has traditionally come
from the federal government.  If the federal tax allowance for state and local
securities are  eliminated, they will also have to pay higher interest rates on
their bonds.<p>
<p>
There is no way to predict exactly when these  pressures will converge in a new
crisis.  The timing of any future economic shock will depend upon political and
business cycle factors which are still unfolding.  But the basic thrust of
public policy is very clear.  The federal government will attempt to cope with
the coming upsurge in its entitlement spending for the elderly by shifting more
responsibilities onto the states.  The states will be able to cope with
devolution when the economy is prosperous but the caps on federal block grants
will cause future recessions to increase the pressure on their fiscal positions
by more than other economic downturns in the modern era.  As a result, the odds
are high that devolution will someday be looked back upon as the first stage of
a more comprehensive restructuring of the American public sector which
culminated in the widespread privatization of state and local government
enterprises during the early years of the 21st century.

<I>Will The Dole Economic Program Boost U.S. Interest Rates? (continued)</I>


<P>

Finally, if the Dole-Kemp team takes over the White House and the Republicans retain control of the White House, there would be a far greater likelihood of radical reform in the nation's hitherto uncontrolled entitlement programs than if the nation continues with its current mix of divided government or a return to full Democratic control over the executive and legislative branches.  The Republicans would be more willing to impose limitations on the growth of Medicare spending.  There is also strong support in the Republican congressional caucus for privatization of the social security system.  The experience of other countries suggests that privatization of the social security system could have a very benign impact on U.S. interest rates by encouraging a rise in the household savings rate.
<P>
At present, most of the nation's new private savings are invested in pension funds.  Until recently, the bulk of these retirement savings were held in the form of defined benefit plans.  Under such plans, corporations made annual contributions to their pension plan in order to create the pool of savings needed to deliver a guaranteed income stream to retired workers.  During the past decade, though, there has been a major shift underway to defined contribution plans, in which corporations and workers contribute to a retirement savings program whose benefits depend upon the return earned by the assets.  Under this form of retirement savings, individuals have a choice of the assets in which their retirement funds are invested whereas under a defined benefit plan they have an income claim which is independent of the return earned by the  fund's assets.  The defined benefit plans penalized the national savings rate during 1980's.  As the stock market  appreciated, some corporations developed overfunded pension plans which attracted corporate raiders.  Other corporations responded to this threat by reducing their contributions and lowering the national savings rate.  
<P>
The defined contribution plans, by contrast, carry no such penalty for either the corporation or the worker.  An individual can save as much as he wants even if he achieves his wealth accumulation target ahead of schedule because of booming equity prices or high interest rates on his fixed income assets.  As a result of the tremendous growth occurring in defined contribution pension plans, the stock market boom of the past few years has not depressed the household savings rate.  Various forms of defined contribution  plans now account for almost one half of all pension fund savings in the U.S. and probably about one third of the three billion dollars of assets in the mutual fund industry.  If retirement savings were still dominated by defined benefit pension plans, the great equity bull market would have produced both a slump in pension contributions and the national savings rate rather than the modest uptick which has occurred since 1994.
<P>
There are many possible models for how the U.S. might privatize its social security system.  Countries as  diverse as Chile, Britain and Australia have already made major strides in the direction of government mandated retirement savings with managment of the funds by the private sector.  The basic goal of any reform program would probably be to provide every U.S. citizen with a compulsorary retirement savings program which would be invested  in a variety of potential investment products subject to careful government supervision.  If introduced to the U.S., such a retirement savings account would function very much like a defined contribution pension plan.  The individual would have an opportunity to invest his retirement savings in a variety of equity and fixed income assets whereas all social security assets are currently invested in short maturity government debt.  It is quite possible that an individual would respond to a booming stock market by reducing his pension fund contributions but, as in 1995, he might decide to maintain his flow of savings despite the rise in capital values.  Under a defined benefit plan, by contrast, the corporations would automatically curtail contributions if a rising stock market pushed asset values above the fund's actuarial target.
<P>
The current social security system has even more perverse side-effects on private savings and the federal deficit than defined benefit pension plans.  It promises a guaranteed income to every American citizen while investing the government's tax receipts in some of the lowest yielding assets available in the financial markets.
<P>
If social security assets had been invested in equities and bonds at practically any point during the past half century, the government would have been able to choose between boosting social security payments or reducing the level of payroll taxation needed to finance the system.
<P>
All the industrial nations will confront great fiscal challenges during the 21st Century because of the aging of their populations.  Two thirds of all the people who have ever lived to the age of 65 in the history of mankind are alive today and life expectancy is still increasing.
<P>
As the U.S. enjoys both a higher birth rate and greater tolerance for immigration than other industrial countries, it will face a much less profound problem in meeting this challenge than countries such as Japan and Germany.  But despite its demographic advantages, even the U.S. will have to confront difficult choices over taxation, the level of benefits, and the appropriate age of retirement during the early decades of the 21st century.
<P>
Despite the fact that Mr. Robert Dole already qualifies for social security and that President Clinton is a member of the baby boom generation which will produce major strains in the social security system's financial health, neither dares to discuss the issue of privatization because the public has not yet been educated about the choices which lie ahead.  
<P>
The White House has appointed a taskforce on social security reform but the membership is so divided they will probably delay their report until after this November's election.  The U.S. Treasury recently announced plans to introduce inflation adjusted government bonds in part because it believes such an instrument will be popular for the retirement savings programs of the baby boom generation.  But while inflation proof  bonds would be useful assets for a privatized social security system, there is no explicit link between their introduction and social security reform.  Since Mr. Dole has hinted that he will be only a one term president while Mr. Clinton will not be allowed to seek a third term, both would be well positioned to take the risk of promoting a major debate about the nation's system of retirement savings.  But on the basis of general philosophical attitudes towards the issue of entitlements in the two major political parties, a Republican White House and Congress are more likely to enact far-reaching social security reforms than a divided government or one dominated solely by the Democrats.  As the critical determinant of the level of U.S. interest rates in the year 2000 will be how social security reform affects the U.S. savings rate, not whether the Congress approves the Dole or Clinton economic programs, a Republican victory in November should not be viewed as negative for the U.S. bond market.

<I>Will Federal Devolution Set the Stage for a State and Local
Privatization Boom in the Next U.S. Recession? (continued)</I><BR>

<P><BR>
Fifth, the U.S. has enjoyed a five year bull market in stocks and bonds which
has produced tremendous gains in household wealth as well as opportunities for
entrepreneurial companies to raise capital.  At the peak in June, the ratio of
stock market capitalization to GDP in the U.S. was about $7 trillion or 91% of
GDP.  This was the highest since 1929, when the market was worth about 81% of
GDP.  The stock market boom has added $2 billion to household net worth since
1984.  It also has permitted an extraordinary boom in new equity public
offerings and corporate fund raising through the sale of non-investment grade
bonds. The number of equity I.P.O.'s was 428 during the first half of 1996
compared to 470 during 1995, 599 during 1994, and a peak of 689 during 1993.
These I.P.O.'s raised about $27.2 billion during the first half of 1996
compared to $27.7 billion last year, $27.7 billion during 1994 and $39.2
billion during 1993.  The peak for I.P.O. financing during the 1980's, by
contrast, was $17.7 billion during 1986.  The search for higher yields also has
helped to revitalize the so-called junk bond market.  In the first half of
1996, Wall Street sold 108 new non-investment grade bond offering compared to
159 during 1995, 190 during 1994, and 343 during 1993.  The funds raised were
$20 billion during the first half of 1996, $28.8 billion during 1995, $231.5
billion during 1994, and $54.4 billion during 1993.  The previous peak in
non-investment grade bond financing was 218 deals worth $30.5 billion during
1986.  The ability of small and medium sized companies to obtain so much
capital from the stock market has helped to encourage the high growth rate of
investment and employment since 1993.<p>
<p>
The stock market boom has also been accompanied by a dramatic expansion of the
mutual fund industry and new forms of retirement savings, such as defined
contribution pension plans which could encourage an impovement in the national
savings rate.  The mutual fund industry now has assets of over $3 trillion
compared to $4.2 trillion in the banking system and nearly one third of mutual
fund assets are in long-term savings programs.  There is some evidence that
defined contribution pension plans have a more positive impact on household
savings during periods of rising equity prices than the traditional defined
benefit pension plans.  Under defined contribution plans, there is no penalty
for households to maintain a steady flow of savings into their retirement
programs as asset prices rise whereas corporations which overfund their pension
plans penalize profits and attract corporate raiders.  In 1995, the household
savings rate in the U.S. rose despite the boom in equity prices.  The uptick in
the savings rate may have resulted from the shift towards greater use of
defined contribution pension system.  The growth of defined contibution savings
could accelerate further if the White House and Congress ever agree to
privatize social security.<p>
<p>
Sixth, the U.S. economy has been a major economic beneficiary of the end of the
cold war and the acceptance of liberal economic ideas by many formerly
communist or mercantilist countries.  The U.S. sends about one third of its
exports to developing countries and during the past five years these markets
have accounted for over two thirds of all export growth.  In 1995, this export
growth slowed because of the financial crisis in Mexico and its spillover
effects on other Latin American countries.  But the IMF-U.S. Treasury rescue
program for Mexico helped to stabilize her financial system and has set the
stage for a recovery this year.  The ability of Mexico to avoid default also
helped to lessen the impact of her crises on other developing countries,
especially in Latin America.<p>
<p>
Finally, the general mix of macroeconomic policy in all the major industrial
nations since 1992 has been supportive of non-inflationary growth.  European
governments have been attempting to reduce their budget deficits by trimming
their public spending. The counterpart to this deficit reduction has been a
large decline in the level of both short-term and long-term interest rates.
Japan has been an outlier to the process of deficit reduction because of the
impact of her  banking crisis on the economy.  But the Bank of Japan has
nevertheless cut short-term interest rates to only 50 basis points in order to
help prop up the financial system.  The current level of interest rates in
Japan is the lowest to occur in any industrial country since the Great
Depression of the 1930's.<p>
<p>
The challenge now confronting Federal Reserve policy makers is to sustain the
expansion by finding a rate of growth which is consistent with the economy's
underlying supply side potential.  There are many points of view on the level
of growth which is optimal for the economy but the Federal Reserve perceives
that the number is about 2.0-2.5% once the economy achieves full employment.
As the economy enjoyed 4.0-5.0% output growth during the second quarter and is
probably expanding at a 3.0-3.5% annual rate during the current quarter, the
odds are high that there could be Federal Reserve tightening during the next
few months to slow the economy's rate of growth.  In fact, a rate hike during
late August is very likely  unless the upcoming data for employment costs shows
a reversal of the uptick which became apparent during the first quarter.<p>
<p>
As inflation expectations are still under control, it is doubtful that the Fed
will raise interest rates by more than 50 basis points this year but there will
be no way to predict the peak until the economy actually slows.  Another
wildcard in the outlook is the lending policies of the credit card companies.
The credit card companies have been so permissive in permitting low income
households to gain access to cards that their stock of non-performing loans has
risen sharply.  If they suddenly curtail access to cards by imposing more
stringent lending quality screens, they will depress consumer spending by lower
income Americans (who account for about 10% of the total).<p>
<p>
A policy of Federal Reserve fine tuning will not cause any sudden or abrupt
changes in the economy's performance this autumn but it could produce a
correction in the equity market.  In fact, the equity market has been very
turbulent during the past four weeks because of investor concern about both
monetary policy and the economic policy risks poised by this autumn's election.
<p>
<p>
Investors are concerned about monetary tightening because they fear it could
set the stage for a profit squeeze next year.  With wages rising in response to
tight labor markets, corporations will find it more difficult to sustain their
profit margins, especially if Fed tightening slows the economy's growth rate.
In 1994, by contrast, the Fed had tightened to reduce upward pressure on
commodity prices, not wages.  Rising commodity prices redistributed income
within the corporate sector whereas rising wages reduce the profit share of
national income.<p>
<p>
Investor confidence also has been depressed by the extremely poor performance
of Robert Dole in the opinion polls. Wall Street has long perceived President
Clinton to be a superior campaigner but they had expected Dole to benefit from
Clinton's scandals in the "emerging market" state of Arkansas as well as his
own retirement from the Senate.  With Mr. Dole still 15-20 points behind in the
opinion polls, investors are becoming apprehensive about the risk of the
Republicans losing control of the Congress, not just the race for the White
House.<p>
<p>
The prospect of the Republicans losing control of the Congress is disturbing to
Wall Street for several reasons.<p>
<p>
First, the 1996 election poses a unique historic challenge for both parties.
No Democratic president has won two consecutive elections since Franklin
Roosevelt in the 1930's.  The Republican Party has not controlled the Congress
for  two consecutive terms since the 1920's.  If the Republicans lose control
again in 1996, it will suggest that the public is turning away from their
themes of deficit reduction, slowing growth of entitlement spending, and
promoting lower marginal income tax rates.<p>
<p>
Secondly, there has been a profound change in the character of the Democratic
Party in the Congress as a result of recent Republican victories.  The
Republican Party now has 77 of the 125 house seats of the old southern
Confederacy compared to 48 in 1992, 34 in 1972 and 6 in 1960.  On the basis of
pending Democratic retirements, the Republicans may even be able to claim
control over two thirds of the seats in the south by next year even if they
lose their overall majority.  As a result of the Republican takeover of the
south, the Democrats now depend far more upon the urban centers of the
northeast, the middle west and California for their congressional membership.
This geographic shift in the composition of the parties suggests that future
Democratic committee chairman would be far more supportive of federal spending
programs and other forms of government intervention in the economy than both
the current Republican chairmen and past Democratic chairmen.<p>
<p>
Thirdly, if the Democrats win a majority in the House, their new speaker would
be Richard Gephardt.  After flirting with the many "New Democratic" political
themes during the mid-1980's, Rep. Gephardt has devoted most of the past decade
to espousing protectionist trade policies, higher marginal income tax rates,
and other forms of government intervention in the economy.<p>
<p>
As a result of the ideological polarization which has occurred in the
congressional membership of both major political parties, a Democratic victory
in this November's congressional races would probably have three immediate
effects on the economy.<p>
<p>
It would encourage investors to sell both U.S. bonds and the U.S. dollar.<p>
<p>
It would probably cause all investors to reduce their exposure to Mexico as
well as other emerging market countries which might be vulnerable to
congressional demands for more restrictive trade polices.<p>
<p>
It would probably encourage many U.S. companies to defer decisions about new
investment and hiring until they had more visibility on how the election would
affect public policy in such critical areas as taxation and labor market
regulation.  Ironically, such caution might cause bond yields to fall during
early 1997, when lower investment depressed the economy, but in late 1996 the
weakness of bond prices would itself help to set the stage for the economic
slowdown.<p>

<I>How Will Investors Respond to the U.S. Government's Inflation Adjusted Bond?
 (continued)</I>

<P>
The Treasury is also asking for debate about the structure of
the new securities.  Should it offer a zero coupon bond or a security
which provides current  income?  In the case of  a bond with current
income, should the indexation for inflation occur monthly, quarterly,
or annually and how long should the lag be with the inflation
rate?  In Britain, there is an eight month indexation lag and
it is perceived to reduce the attractiveness of index linked securities.
 The one issue which the Treasury has not proposed for debate
is the tax treatment of the bonds.   It intends to tax both the
real return and the inflation adjustment component of the new
instruments despite the fact that Britain, Canada and other Commonwealth
countries have exempted the inflation adjustment from taxation.
 Senior officials in the Clinton administration are aware of the
tax differential with the other countries but they cannot introduce
a tax allowance for the inflation component of the bond return
without obtaining Congressional permission.  As a result of the
intense partisan environment in Washington following this winter's
acrimony over fiscal policy, they are reluctant to seek congressional
cooperation in adding a tax allowance.   The decision to tax the
inflation component of the return will greatly reduce the appeal
of the index linked securities for taxable investors, such as
high income individuals, but it will not discourage demand from
pension funds and other tax exempt retirement savings programs.
<P>
The Treasury has not yet volunteered an opinion on the yield which
the new index linked bonds will have to offer because it will
obviously depend upon market conditions at the time of issue.
 At present, the UK  government's index linked bond is offering
a real yield of 3.9%, the Australian and Canadian index linked
bonds offer real yields of 4.5-5.0% and New Zealand index linked
debt offers a real yield of 5.9%.  The government of the United
States should be able to sell securities at a lower yield than
her Majesty's governments in London, Ottawa, Canberra and Wellington,
but it is doubtful that the yield will be much below the yield
available on the UK securities for two reasons.  First, the U.S.
government wants to tax the security's inflation adjustment whereas
Her Majesty's governments in other English speaking countries
do not impose any tax.  Secondly, American investors have enjoyed
such high returns on conventional financial assets during recent
years that they will probably not be attracted to a low yield
inflation adjusted security until there is more widespread pessimism
about the outlook for inflation itself.  The real yield on U.S.
equities during the 20th century has averaged about 6.8% while
the real yield during the past decade has been close to 10.2%.
 The real yield on U.S. bonds during the past century has averaged
close to 3.0% but real interest rates were so high during the
1980's that many investors now believe they should earn a real
yield on bonds of at least 4.0-6.0% excluding capital gains. 
Since 1992, the yields on long-term Treasury securities have fluctuated
between 5.5% and 8.25% while the annual CPI inflation rate has
averaged 3.0%, 2.8% and 2.6%.  The real total return on U.S. government
bonds since 1986 has also been 5.14%.
<P>
In its early stages, the new index linked security will probably
appeal to four categories of investors.  First, it will be of
interest to pension funds which want to obtain an inflation-adjusted
asset which they can use for matching with long-term liabilities.
 Secondly, the instrument will appeal to investment contrarians
whom believe that Wall Street has become overly optimistic about
inflation and that the move towards expansionary monetary policy
now underway in most G-7 countries will produce a burst of higher
commodity prices next year.   Since the U.S. Treasury's index
linked bond has the potential to be more liquid and tradable than
the index linked bonds of other countries, it could also help
to attract capital from inflation wary investors all over the
world.  Thirdly, many Wall Street firms will probably use the
index-linked bonds to create new hybrid securities offering arbitrage
against other potential inflation hedges, such as gold, commodities,
and real estate.  The Treasury may also produce an instrument
with strip features which could emerge as a popular way for traders
to play on the market's changing perceptions of inflation.  Wall
Street has not yet developed a nickname for the index linked bonds,
but it is not difficult to imagine labels such as the &quot;Clinton
strips&quot; or &quot;Rubin Zeros&quot; becoming popular in the
financial media.  Finally, retail investment service organizations
will probalby use the index linked bonds to develop inflation
adjusted annuities and other retirement oriented products.
<P>
When the UK government introduced index linked bonds, it was perceived
that the major loser in institutional asset allocation models
would be real estate.  As a result of Britain's high inflation
rate after 1950, property had come to play an increasingly important
role in the portfolio of many British pension funds and insurance
companies.  Because of the long upturn in the UK economy after
1982, the index linked bonds did not prevent a significant boom
in British commercial and residential real estate during the mid
and late 1980's.  But as a result of the poor performance of British
property since 1989, the odds are high that many institutions
will increase the weighting of index linked bonds at the expense
of property  and other traditional inflation hedge assets in the
future.  A similar trend could occur in the U.S. once institutions
became more comfortable with index-linked securities.

<P>
The U.S. Treasury has been debating the introduction of index
linked bonds for many years.  After the Thatcher government introduced
them in 1981, many American economists suggested that they would
be a useful innovation in government finance for the U.S. Treasury
as well.  In the early 1980's, the interaction of large budget
deficits, restrictive monetary policy, and financial deregulation
produced real yields on U.S. government bonds as high as 8-9%,
so it was widely perceived that the Treasury would be able to
save money by introducing index linked bonds.  Many economic commentators
also stressed that the introduction of index linked bonds would
deny government the benefits of future inflation in reducing its
debt servicing costs and thus remove one of the great moral hazard
risks in economic policy.  But Wall Street was opposed to the
introduction of index linked bonds and Donald Regan did not want
to challenge the dealer community.  He might also have been uncomfortable
about possible comparisons with the D-mark denominated securities
which the Treasury had briefly introduced during the Carter administration
in order to bolster investor confidence in the dollar.
<P>
The Treasury probably has several motives for introducing index
linked bonds today.
<P>
First, bond yields have recently increased by almost 100 basis
points because of investor anxiety about a revival of the economy
and the failure of congressional efforts to reduce the federal
deficit.  The Treasury hopes that it will be able to reduce its
funding costs by offering a security which is indexed for inflation.
<P>
Secondly, the index linked bonds will provide a new yardstick
for measuring inflation expectations in the financial markets.
 At present, policy makers attempt to gauge inflationary psychology
by focusing on variables such as commodity prices, gold, the Australian
dollar, and the slope of the yield curve but none of these indicators
is as pure a proxy for inflation expectations as an instrument
which will be directly linked to the CPI, the GDP deflator, or
some comparable inflation index.
<P>
Thirdly, the Treasury views the index linked bond as an instrument
which could be attractive to the baby boomers now accumulating
savings for retirement through defined contribution pension funds,
401-K plans, Individual Retirement Accounts, and so on.  The U.S.
mutual fund industry now has over $3 trillion of assets compared
to $4.2 trillion of assets in the banking system and nearly one
third of the mutual fund industry's assets are in long-term retirement
savings programs.  As the baby boom generation moves into its
late 40's and 50's, it will be increasing its allocation of capital
to long-term retirement savings programs which would be a natural
market for an inflation indexed security.  If the federal government
ever decides to privatize the social security system through the
creation of  Chilean style household retirement accounts, such
savings programs also would be a potentially important market
for index linked bonds.  At present, social security assets are
invested in short maturity government instruments with yields
which correlate with those in the marketplace.  They provide no
explicit guarantees against inflation despite the fact that social
security payments are indexed for inflation.
<P>
As a result of the good performance of inflation in the U.S. economy
during recent years, the introduction of U.S. Treasury index linked
debt will have a less dramatic impact on the investment community
than would have been the case during the 1970's or 1980's.  But
the yield which emerges on the index linked bonds will gradually
become an important benchmark for evaluating the portfolio returns
on both traditional investment products as well as those focused
specifically on beating inflation.
<P>
What remains to be seen is whether the U.S. Treasury will actually
be able to reduce its funding costs by introducing index linked
bonds.  Cynics have already argued that the decision to offer
index linked debts is a confirmation that inflation has bottomed
and that the government is accepting a liability which will prove
to be quite expensive in future years.  But cynicism aside, the
real problem facing the Treasury is that investors have earned
such high returns form both equities and conventional debt securities
during recent years that they may not be prepared to accept a
low real yield on a taxable index linked bond until they see clear
evidence of accelerating inflation and a correction in other financial
asset markets.  At present, there is little sign of such a sentiment
shift occurring.  Despite the recent uptick in oil and food prices,
investors have remained remarkably complacent about the risk of
higher inflation.  As a result, the Treasury should consider hedging
its new funding strategy with other financial alternatives.  Instead
of offering the public only a security indexed to the inflation
rate, it should introduce new instruments indexed to both the
inflation rate and the S&amp;P 500.  Once it has established a
market for both securities, the Treasury could then fine tune
the issuance of new supply to reflect changing investor perceptions
of the economic outlook.  On the basis of current investor attitude,
it is doubtful that the Treasury will be able to achieve significant
savings by offering instruments indexed only to the CPI.  But
by offering instruments for hedging against both inflation and
stock market risk, it should be able to both reduce government
borrowing costs and create useful instruments for helping the
baby boom generation cope with the coming transition to a privatized
social security system.

<I>Economic Implications of the Mutual Fund Boom (continued)</I><BR>

<P><BR>


While low interest rates helped to ignite the mutual fund boom of the early 1990's, several other factors are now helping to sustain it.

<P>

First, the industry has been steadily expanding its range of products.  There are now 2211 equity funds compared to 1127 in 1990 and 471 in 1984.  In the equity sector, there are now 352 aggressive growth funds, 699 general growth funds, 481 growth and income funds, 33 precious metal funds, 112 equity income funds, 367 international equity funds (excludes U.S.) and 167 global equity funds (includes U.S.).  In the fixed income sector, there are now 2,544 bond funds compared to 1,235 in 1990 and 349 in 1994.  There are 332 government bond funds, 99 high yield corporate bond funds, 306 long-term municipal bond funds, and hundreds of other bond funds offering different combinations of yield and risk.   In the money market sector, there are 672 taxable money market funds, 158 national tax exempt money market funds, and 167 state tax exempt money market funds.   Despite the proliferation of new funds, though, assets in the industry are becoming more concentrated.  The top five fund management groups now account for 36% of industry assets compared to 29% in 1984.  These organizations are spending heavily on marketing and thus increasing consumer awareness of new mutual fund products.

<P>

Secondly, the expansion of the mutual fund industry has coincided with a dramatic expansion of U.S. stock market capitalization.  In January, the market capitalization of America's 7,551 listed companies was about $6.63 trillion compared to $5 trillion in January, 1994 (6,925 companies) and $3,957 trillion in January, 1992 (5,608 companies).  The ratio of stock market capitalization to GDP has risen to 87.5% compared to a previous all time high of 81.0% in 1929 and a post war peak of 79.0% in 1968.  The all time trough of stock market capitalization to GDP was 16.0% in 1941 while in the post-war era it was 30.0% in 1974 and 1982.  The average ratio of stock market capitalization to GDP since 1926 has been 48.0%.  Rising equity prices have had a self-reinforcing impact on mutual fund demand by encouraging greater risk-taking in the household sector.

<P>

Some stock market pundits regard the sharp rise in the ratio of stock market capitalization to GDP as a sign of speculative overheating but evidence of serious excesses is inconclusive.  The market's price/earnings ratio is only about 16-17 compared to 26 in 1991 and levels in the 15-19 range during the late 1960's, when interest rates were previously at current levels.    Aside from the ratio of stock market capitalization to GDP, the two  measures of equity valuation which appear to be at extreme levels are dividend yields and Tobin's Q (the ratio of stock market value to asset replacement costs).    The U.S. equity market now offers a dividend yield of only 2.6% compared to a previous trough of 2.7% in 1972 and an average of 4.0% during the 1980's.  The ratio of equity prices to asset replacement costs has risen to 1.47 from a previous peak of 1.08 in 1965 and an average of .56 during the 1980's.  But there are four explanations for the stock market's valuation  level which suggest that the U.S. equity market may not be over-extended.    First, inflation expectations have been falling steadily during recent years and economic forecasters are now projecting that it will remain subdued through  at least  1997.    Secondly, despite  low  inflation, the return on U.S. corporate capital has risen above 10% during the past two years for the first time since the late 1960's.  The gains in profitability have resulted from expanded productivity and thus also contributed to the low inflation evironment in the economy.  Thirdly, it is difficult for traditional measures of book value and asset replacement cost to capture the earnings potential which companies have as a result of new developments in technology and investment in human capital.  As U.S. firms dominate many high technology sectors and technology has been an important market theme since 1994, book value has been a less dominant criteria for investment decision making.  Finally, the end of the cold war has created a global market economy with 6 billion people compared to the 1.5 billion living in market oriented economies before 1989.  In fact, if we add the foreign sales of U.S. multinational firms to GDP in order to compute a ratio of stock market capitalization to American controlled output, the ratio of stock market capitalization to output drops from 87.5% to 75%.  American firms now have $1.5 trillion of foreign sales excluding exports and this number should expand rapidly as they diversify into new high growth developing countries.

<P>

Thirdly, the mutual fund industry is benefiting from the high growth of retirement oriented savings products, such as Individual Retirement Accounts, 401-K plans, and various forms of defined contribution pension plans.  In 1994, such retirement savings accounted for $716 billion of the industry's $2.1 trillion of assets.  IRA programs had $362 billion of assets while defined contribution pension plans had $236 billion of assets.  As a growing number of companies are shifting from defined benefit pension plans to defined contribution plans, the retirement savings held in mutual funds should expand at a steady rate in the future.  In the late 1970's, Peter Drucker had produced a book contending that the U.S. was evolving towards a pension fund form of socialism, in which retirement plans would own most of the U.S. industry and alter worker attitudes towards business.  But this argument was misfocused because the defined benefit plans which prevailed in that period offered the workers guaranteed returns, not the right to choose between a variety of funds with potentially divergent returns.  Today, retirement plans are continuing to expand their ownership of the stock market but they are not producing a passive form of pension fund socialism.  The U.S. is instead embarking upon an unprecedented experiment in the democratization of bond and equity ownership through a mixture of mutual funds, defined contribution pension plans, and direct ownership of securities.  The New York Stock Exchange recently published a study estimating that 51.3 million Americans now own shares directly or through retirement savings programs compared to 42.9 million in 1989, 20 million in 1965 and 6 million during the early 1950's.

<FONT SIZE=-1><I>A new WETA series<BR>underwritten by Kemper Funds management</I>
</FONT>

<P>




According to the <A HREF="http://www.ncoa.org">National Council on Aging</A>, someone will turn 50 every 7.5 seconds from now until 2014. But what does it mean to be a mid-lifer? What are the options? The possibilities? The realities? Mid-life is a time of dramatic change. Today's mid-life generation is uniquely positioned to experience this time as no generation has before -- they are healthier than their parents were; they have more choices; and they will live longer.

<P>

<I>In the Prime</I> explores being in the prime of life today. Part of a multimedia project from WETA, Washington, D.C., <I>In the Prime</I> is a 26-part, weekly, half-hour television series that can be seen on public television stations nationwide (<A HREF="intheprime_times.html">check local listings</A>). Hosted by veteran journalist Deborah Potter, <I>In the Prime</I> presents personal profiles, commentaries, and studio discussions with experts to address issues such as love, career, family, money, retirement, responsibility, mortality, and the many approaches to a physically and spiritually healthy life.

<P>

The very idea of mid-life is an evolving one. Since 1900, the average life expectancy has grown more than it had in the previous 2,000 years, according to Dr. Robert Butler of Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York City. Not so very long ago, people could well expect to die by the age of 50. Today retirement age is creeping upward. Now instead of retiring at 65, some people are continuing to work; others have set a much earlier retirement goal and leave the work world at 50 or 55 to pursue a dream -- from sailing around the world to returning to school, to moving to a rural setting from a city.

<P>

"Today the mentality of being 50 is more like being 40 was years ago," says Phylis Geller, executive producer of the series, and senior vice president of cultural programming and new media for WETA, Washington, D.C. "It's a whole new environment with so many exciting options. <I>In the Prime</I> is a sort of road map that will present all of the avenues for today's mid-lifers."

<P>

<I>In the Prime</I> introduces viewers to some of the people who have chosen to see the second half of their lives in terms of freedom and opportunity, rather than resignation and regret. Together with guests as varied as comedian Tom Smothers, Sydney Biddle Barrows (the "Mayflower Madam"), poet Judith Viorst, financial adviser John McIntyre, The New Yorker writer Brendan Gill, restaurateur Nora Pouillon, feminist author Letty Cottin Pogrebin, spiritual philosopher Deepak Chopra, and many others, Potter reviews the life choices associated with being over 45.

<P>

"What people are pursuing at mid-life is different from what they pursued in their youth. They often begin to look inward and sense that it's time to shift their focus to more fundamental things," says senior producer Phil O'Connor.

<P>

The series reviews how people assess themselves as they approach mid-life; how they evaluate where they are in terms of their early expectations and how they see their future; how they approach romantic relationships, both old and new; and how they look at nonretirement, divorce, creativity, and work. <I>In the Prime</I> looks at the possibilities for mid-lifers in the current climate of corporate America, at the capacity to learn after a certain age, and at facing serious illness and the alternative treatments to traditional Western medicine, and explores what it means to be a true adult.

<P>

Host Deborah Potter has more than 20 years of experience in broadcast journalism. She served as the Washington correspondent for CNN from 1991 to 1994, and was with CBS News for 13 years as White House, State Department, and congressional correspondent.

<P>

The television series is part of a multimedia project that includes print, online, and video components. <I>In the Prime</I> is a production of WETA, Washington, D.C., with funding provided by Kemper Funds. Executive producer is Phylis Geller; Phil O'Connor is senior producer. Associate producers are Anna Chen and Janice Holland.

<P>

<A HREF="http://www.weta.org/itp/"><IMG BORDER=0 SRC="../gifs/friendslist_weta_logo.gif" ALIGN=LEFT>
WETA</A>, Washington, D.C., is the third largest producer of programs for public television, including the award-winning series The Civil War, Baseball, In Performance at the White House, and The Kennedy Center Presents. Other cultural programming series debuting this fall include The West and National Geographic's Inside the White House. Sharon Percy Rockefeller is president and CEO of WETA.

<IMG SRC = "gifs/inflation_tamed_head.gif" ALT = "Inflation: Tamed!">
<BR>
Is it true? Can it be possible that inflation - the beast that once intimidated us all - has been tamed? Citing persistently low levels of inflation even during recent strong economic growth, many economists including Zurich Kemper Investments, Inc. Chief Economist John Silvia believe that the Federal Reserve Board has largely succeeded in controlling inflation. If it's true that the lion will roar no more (or at least for the foreseeable future), there may be some issues that you need to rethink.
<P>

<IMG SRC = "gifs/inflation_tamed1_subhead.gif" ALT = "Putting puny into perspective...">
<BR>
At its highest in the last 45 years, consumer price inflation was 14.6 percent in March 1980. You would have needed almost 15 percent just to have forward motion in either the return on your investments or in a salary increase. Now, with inflation averaging about 3.5 percent in the last five years, you don't need double-digits to make the kind of progress that you did during high inflation periods. True, the numbers are punier, but low inflation may mean that you can keep more of what you earn.
<P>

<IMG SRC = "gifs/inflation_tamed2_subhead.gif" ALT = "A house is a home...">
<BR>
And that may be just about it. Residential real estate's ability to keep up with what was then the high rate of inflation in the 1970s and 1980s provided many homeowners with a nest egg they could live in. But the absence of inflation in today's environment begs the question: If housing keeps pace with inflation and inflation has been de-fanged to about 3 percent, how will tomorrow's nest eggs be built? According to Silvia, many Americans are substituting financial assets for real estate assets as their prime way of building net worth. Rather than being counseled to stretch themselves to buy a home today, younger Americans are now being urged to invest. 
<P>

<IMG SRC = "gifs/inflation_tamed3_subhead.gif" ALT = "Consume if you must...">
<BR>
But savvy shoppers are learning to postpone their buying as long as they can. That's a departure from the 1970s and 1980s when Americans bought as soon as they could rather than run the risk of paying higher prices later. Silvia says the low inflation environment has made it possible for discounters like Wal-Mart and Home Depot to exist. "You have to have stable prices in order for someone to come in and make a business out of discounting those prices," he says.
<P>

<IMG SRC = "gifs/inflation_tamed4_subhead.gif" ALT = "But never a borrower be...">
<BR>
Borrowing makes some sense when you can borrow today and pay your creditor with dollars that will be worth less tomorrow. That's not true in 1996, especially if your borrowing takes the form of charging to a 19.8 percent credit card account at a time when inflation is averaging 3 percent. You're providing your lender with a very high, very real return of approximately 16.8 percent. 
<P>


<BLOCKQUOTE>

<IMG SRC = "gifs/inflation_tamed5_subhead.gif" ALT = "The Risk Persists">
<BR>
While it may seem to be under control for now, inflation continues to represent a risk for investors. Even if the U.S. economy continued in its current 3 percent inflation bliss for the next 20 years, the purchasing power of $1 would be reduced to 55 cents by 2016. That's why investment experts continue to recommend investments that have historically outpaced inflation.

Psychology is a key consideration to financial market and economic
analysis. In fact, psychology is a required course for undergraduate
students in economics. Consumer purchases of homes and autos rise when
households feel good about their jobs and their future. In contrast,
when consumers are uncertain, auto and home sales weaken. Psychology is
also key to business spending. Survey results on business optimism show
that firms buy more equipment and hire more workers when their
confidence is fairly high that the economy will continue to grow.
<BR><BR>

One psychological indicator, the monthly University of Michigan's
Consumer Sentiment Index, is considered a leading indicator of the
direction of the economy. When the consumer is reported to be
"cautious," for example, the economy may be headed for a slowdown. For
business sentiment, surveys by organizations such as the Conference
Board offer a reliable view of hiring plans and capital spending
intentions.
<BR><BR>

Consumer psychology, however, can be tricky. Purchasing in the United
States does not rise and fall solely with the spirits of the American
consumers. Because Americans are conditioned to watch for sales, buying
activity can often be skewed by price. 
<BR><BR>

As an example, let's consider the advertising and promotion techniques
used by auto manufacturers. For years, the U.S. auto industry sold autos
by offering rebates. What happened? Consumers caught on quickly and
started to insist on rebates before they would buy. Auto companies were
then forced to use more frequent rebates and broaden the availability of
autos sold with rebates. 
<BR><BR>

Today, the U.S. economy has a similar problem. For several years now,
the inflation rate has fallen steadily. Consumers have come to expect
it. As a result, housing markets have become dependent on prospective
home buyers waiting for a decline in mortgage rates. Across the board,
consumers will tend to postpone purchases because they expect inflation
to fall, not rise. Sales of consumer durables such as furniture, carpets
and even autos all have seen the impact of this changed consumer
psychology. How different this is from the buy-now (before prices rise
again) psychology of the 1970s!
<BR><BR>

But consumers cannot help but react to economic news. In the second half of 1995, the economy slowed down. Employment growth, in
particular, fell off. Seeing this, consumers became less confident about
their jobs - which, in turn, set off a chain reaction. Reduced
confidence in job security prompted some consumers to reduce spending.
Business optimism also turned cautious as economic weakness in Mexico
and the consumer spending slowdown reduced profit and sales
expectations. Job security, not wages, became a key focus of households.
<BR><BR>

As the country moves through this stage of the economic cycle, another
factor is influencing consumer psychology today. Consumer expectations
toward retirement also have changed, as most Americans expect that they
will have to provide more and more of their own retirement income. Less
financial support will come via Social Security benefits. To be prepared, U.S. households
have started to raise their savings rates in recent years. This change
has shifted consumer budgets toward more investment in financial assets
(for example: mutual funds, equities, bank deposits, life insurance) and
less spending on real assets (consumer goods).
<BR><BR>

Where consumer confidence goes from here depends upon employment
prospects and interest rate trends. For as long as employment growth is
positive, consumer psychology will probably remain positive but
cautious. Positive consumer sentiment should suggest continued economic
growth. The pace of growth, however, is likely to reflect Americans'
new-found caution on job security.

<IMG SRC="gifs/gamefedfund_head.gif" ALT="The Game Of Federal Funding">
<BR>

In a roundabout way, when you invest in a U.S. government mutual fund,
you participate in funding the operations of the U.S. government.
Securities that government mutual funds invest in include securities
issued by the U.S. Treasury, its agencies and instrumentalities. 
<BR><BR>

"Think of the federal government as a corporation, and the U.S. Treasury
as the corporation's treasurer," says Kemper Portfolio Strategist Rob
Schumacher. "The government has business to do (projects to spend money
on such as defense, social programs and so on) and the treasurer is in
charge of making sure that the necessary resources are available."
<BR><BR>

How much money does the country need to run? In 1996, the budget
proposal is for $1.6 trillion. Payroll and corporate taxes provide some
of
what's needed. But because the country's spending has exceeded its
revenue
every year since 1969, the government borrows heavily to pay for all of
what it wants to do. In fact, the U.S. government securities market is
the largest securities market in the world. In a typical week (we'll use
the week starting February 5, 1996 as an example), the U.S. Treasury
will
borrow more than $19 billion to meet its maturing obligations and
projected cash needs.
<BR><BR>

Although opinions differ about the appropriateness of Uncle Sam's
spending habits, its system for raising funds is impressive. (As
Schumacher says, "When you owe people several trillion dollars, you have
to have a very efficient method of making sure that you can meet your
obligations.")
<BR><BR>

Unlike what other borrowers might encounter, the government has no
problem raising funds because the securities the U.S. Treasury issues
are direct obligations of the U.S. Treasury - they're backed by the
"full faith and credit" of the United States. Mutual funds, institutions
and individuals are among the groups willing to invest in these
securities. (Of course, mutual fund shares are not guaranteed.)
<BR><BR>

In order to meet its financing requirements (which include making
interest payments due on its debt), the Treasury auctions securities of
varying maturities. Most of the funds are borrowed for a short time, and
13-week and
26-week Treasury bills are auctioned every week. Treasuries of longer
maturities are auctioned less frequently.
<BR><BR>

Perhaps the greatest variable in the process is the price that the
government will have to pay for funds it borrows. This "price" is
influenced by interest rates as set by the Federal Reserve Board and the
open market. 
<BR><BR>

And, Schumacher says, it's in the monitoring of interest rates where the
professional management of a government income mutual fund can provide
value to fund shareholders. "What are interest rates going to do? What
maturity Treasury securities should the fund be investing in for maximum
performance?" According to Schumacher, "These are the questions the
professional manager deals with every day."

Interest rates come in several different sizes: short, intermediate and
long. They also have different "flavors": the rates that are available
on U.S. Treasury, corporate and municipal securities. Finally, rates
reflect the push and pull of different forces: growth, inflation,
deficits and currency fluctuations.
<BR><BR>

The behavior of interest rates is of more than academic interest.
Investors in money market funds and fixed-income funds, for example, own
different types of securities with different maturities. Whether short-
and long-term interest rates move together or apart will determine the
relative performance of these funds.
<BR><BR>

First, let's take a look at the various sizes of interest rates.
Short-term rates refer to rates on instruments such as bank loans or
U.S. Treasury bills that are fewer than two years in maturity. Rates on
instruments between two and seven years in maturity are considered
intermediate term; long-term rates are those paid on instruments that
are seven or more years to maturity. Securities with a longer time
exposure have a greater possibility of inflation, recession or default. 
<BR><BR>

Interest rates also vary by the flavor of the security. Because they are
often tax-exempt, municipal securities (which are issued by state and
local governments and agencies) tend to offer lower interest rates than
government or corporate securities. Corporate securities are considered
more risky than governments and therefore interest rates on corporates
tend to be higher than those on governments.
<BR><BR>

In 1994, a fascinating year for watching interest rates, we saw a divergence in the performance of both different size
and flavor interest rates. Short rates such as the prime rate charged on
bank loans responded as the Federal Reserve Board steadily increased the
rates it charged on the overnight lending of reserves. When the Federal
Reserve raises the rates it charges banks, that affects the returns an
investor can expect on securities.
<BR><BR>

Long rates rose along with short rates as long-term (bond) investors
believed that the Fed was raising short rates in response to
expectations of stronger growth and higher inflation. But while short
and intermediate rates tend to be driven by Fed policy, long rates react
to an array of investor expectations - expectations of currency
stability and fiscal deficits as well as of economic growth and
inflation. 
<BR><BR>

The difference in factors that determine rates was clearly evident by
the fourth quarter of 1994. The Fed was still raising short rates. But,
by then, long rates had stabilized and even started to decline. Why? The
market expectations that influence long rates had changed. Financial
markets started to expect that economic growth would slow and inflation
would not rise. Short rates, on the other hand, continued to react to
the Fed's actions.
<BR><BR>

Interest rate flavors acted differently as well. Rates on corporate
securities, in particular, did not rise as much Treasuries. Corporate
credit quality was expected to improve as the economy looked stronger
and therefore the traditional difference between what an investor might
earn on a corporate versus a Treasury security narrowed even as interest
rates, in general, rose. Municipal rates, meanwhile, reflected the
relative supply/demand of their own market more than the overall shift
of economic expectations.

The daily news is filled with economic reports that could conceivably
affect the value of your investments. What should keep you up at night
and what can you afford to ignore? We'll attempt to turn the lights on
some of the risks that could threaten your sleep.
<BR><BR>

Risks are inherent in all our activities. As individuals and as
investors, we must understand those risks particularly as they apply to
an economic forecast. At Kemper, our outlook is for steady economic
growth without a rapid rise in inflation. 
<BR><BR>

But what are the risks associated with this forecast? How can we
recognize the risks? If risks become realities, what are we likely to
see? Three risks to our forecast are associated with inflation
expectations, the dollar and consumer confidence.
<BR><BR>

Inflation expectations are a key factor influencing the trend in
long-term interest rates. Recent data suggest that Americans expect
inflation to rise at a rate of three percent or so. The risk is that
inflation could rise by more than that. 
<BR><BR>

You've probably heard or read the news that prices on commodities,
particularly those used in the production of goods for consumers and
businesses, have risen recently. Prices paid and prices received by
purchasing managers have been higher in recent months. Energy prices are
also up. 
<BR><BR>

If these commodity prices are perceived as becoming widespread or begin
to filter into consumer products, then inflation expectations may rise.
Investors can be expected to start to factor higher inflation into their
pricing and they'll require higher interest rates to compensate for the
risk of such higher inflation. If that happens, interest rates could
rise higher than our forecast expects and this could reduce economic
growth more than expected.
<BR><BR>

Another recent economic newsmaker has been the value of the U.S. dollar.
For some time, financial markets were concerned about the dollar's
depreciation against the Japanese yen. 
<BR><BR>

Dollar fluctuations are normal. Each year the dollar appreciates against
some currencies while it depreciates against other currencies. 
<BR><BR>

What happens if the dollar continues to depreciate against the same
currency? This depreciation would tend to discourage
foreign investors from buying U.S. securities - particularly U.S.
Treasury bonds. When foreigners think the dollar is weak, they expect to
be compensated with higher interest rates. When higher rates have to be
paid and the U.S. Treasury's cost of borrowing rises, interest rates
rise across the board. This hinders both U.S. economic growth and investment
performance.
<BR><BR>

Consumer confidence is a third risk. From 1991 through mid-1994, consumer
confidence rose in an environment of improving job growth and lower
interest rates. 
<BR><BR>

Spending by consumers represents approximately two-thirds of total
spending in the economy - so you can see that consumer confidence is
important. But when interest rates are rising and job growth is slowing,
there is a risk that consumer confidence will falter. A decline in
consumer confidence, then, has the result of slowing growth further.
<BR><BR>

Over the next year, these three risks - inflation, the dollar and
consumer confidence - do not appear sufficiently high to threaten
continued economic growth. Consider them benign boogiemen. 
<BR><BR>

But the threat they represent can change over time and, of course,
non-economic risks (such as politics and war) can make them even
scarier. Because the risk profile of the economy for 1996 remains low
and the probability of continued economic growth high, we think that now
is a good time for you to get your sleep.

<P>
Concerns about the availability and financing of health care in the future are the 
primary focus of government and household planning today. For investors, the 
health care debate provides added emphasis to the need for retirement planning 
and the need for investment vehicles to provide for health care expenditures 
associated with retirement funding. 
<P>

Let's review the two different sets of pressures that are forcing today's debate on the 
future of health care.
<P>

Budget deficit reduction at the federal government level is the first pressure. The 
task of reducing federal deficits to somewhere close to balanced over the next seven 
years requires the government to slow down the growth of its spending on health 
care. Programs such as Medicare will still grow but the rate of growth 
must be reduced.  Although the elderly will be responsible for paying higher 
Medicare premiums, their responsibility will equal less than one-third of their 
Medicare bill, with the other two-thirds of the bill continuing to be paid for by taxpayers. 
<P>

Reducing the pace of federal spending on health care, then, means that more of the 
burden of retirees' health care must be borne by retirees themselves. Higher co-payments and alternative ways of delivering health care are among the solutions to 
be considered.
<P>

Demographics are the second pressure forcing the debate. The baby boom will soon 
start its inevitable march into retirement, and this will balloon the demand for 
Medicare services. Certainly the federal taxpayer cannot support the baby boom at 
the same level of retiree health benefits as is being done for the current generation 
of retirees. Future retirees will have to provide more for their own health care. 

<P>

The United States is not alone in insisting on this. The retirement financing burden 
has already forced change in pension programs in Germany and Sweden. As in other 
countries, the political transition can be expected to meet resistance, however. The 
elderly, a strong voting bloc in the U.S., will continue to fight for the preservation of 
retiree benefits, and there are many politicians who are willing to play along in the 
interest of gathering votes. 

<P>

How will health care be funded? Retirement planning has been developed to meet 
funding needs. As a result of federal deficit reduction, the present Baby Boomers 
and Generation Xers need to increase the amount they invest from their current 
income to provide for a retirement that assumes a greater responsibility for their 
health care costs.
<P>

Knowing that their retirement has to provide for everyday living and health care 
expenses, will workers today try to set aside incrementally more for the future? Yes, 
at least that's my expectation. Proposals for expanded Individual Retirement 
Account (IRA) and 401(k) programs also reflect this thinking. The rational 
individual, if he or she wants to enjoy the retirement standard of living that others 
enjoyed before cuts in federal benefits, would be expected to increase investment 
now.  Private funding by individuals must make up the shortfall in public funding for retirement.
<P>

Without increased private funding, the quality of the retirement experience will 
indeed diminish for future retirees. Present retirees benefited from an unusual 
coincidence of generous government benefits, demographics and unexpected 
health care improvements. Future generations will not likely benefit from at least the 
first two. However, we are starting to see some innovations designed with 
tomorrow's retiree in mind.  Through the development of new payment systems and 
pricing policies, health care providers such as hospitals, insurers and doctors also 
have started to alter their means of helping patients finance their health care.

<P>
Mobility is a characteristic of American life.  We love our cars.  We "go away" to college.   We change homes and careers several times in our lives.  However, it is income and class mobility that truly differentiates the American way of life from the rest of the globe.  America was settled by people from all lands who sought a "better life" for their subsequent generations relative to the life that was possible in the "old country."  Our parents ingrained in us that we could "do 
better."
<P>

Official U.S. Treasury data* illustrate the income mobility of Americans.  A recent study divided households into five groups (quintiles).  One conclusion from the study: In the three lowest quintiles, one-third or fewer of the taxpayers in the quintile at the beginning of the sample period were in the same quintile at the end of the sample period just nine years later. Two out of three taxpayers had improved their earnings sufficiently to move out of the bottom earning quintile.

<P>

Income mobility can be dramatic.  More taxpayers in the bottom quintile moved to the top quintile over the nine-year period than stayed in the bottom quintile. Only 14 percent of households in the lowest quintile at the start of this study remained in the lowest quintile 9 years later at the end of the study.  One quarter (25 percent) entered the middle class (the third percentile). That's in just nine years!  Think about the mobility between generations!  

<P>

What's the explanation for this mobility?  Education and freedom, two aspects of American life that we take for granted, are really quite unique in the world and are key to mobility.  Rigid social societies, such as Mexico or Iran, have seen violent revolutions as a consequence of angry people who felt trapped in their position. In the United States, access to high school education and the many levels of college education offer people of all ages the opportunity to gather skills necessary for a better job (i.e., income mobility).  

<P>

Freedom allows people, once they have skills, to apply anywhere they want for a job that uses their skills.  In some countries, individuals can make money but still not move out of their class. This is true of Indian and Chinese entrepreneurs in southeast Asia and Africa.  In the U.S., where people can relocate, change jobs within a career and change careers, labor mobility reduces the average cost of labor and the average level of unemployment.

<P>

Education and freedom are unique to the American experience because it is so 
accessible to everyone -- especially because it has the ability to make the greatest impact on those in the lowest quintile.

<P>

My own career is an example of this.  My father never went to high school, my mother graduated from high school but never thought of college. But because I had the advantage of my parents' savings, a scholarship and federal loans, I was able to go to college and beyond that to get my doctorate in economics. Then I exercised my freedom to make a choice by applying for and getting a faculty position at Indiana University.  Then I was free again to move to Chicago and work at Kemper. 

<P>

With Kemper, shareholders are attempting to provide mutual funds to provide for the American dream of income mobility for their children.  It's our job -- and one we take seriously -- to help them realize that dream.

<IMG SRC="gifs/whatsosp_head.gif" ALT="What's So Special About 6 Percent?">

<BR>

To market-watchers, plenty. A 6 percent yield on a 30-year Treasury bond is a benchmark for the economy. A higher cost of borrowing (when yields exceed 6 percent) limits the possibilities for corporations and consumers. 

<P>

Long-term yields have been as high as 8 percent in 1990, 1992 and 1994 -- which experts do not like to see. Why should Treasuries, which represent insignificant risk, yield 8 percent when the historical average return on stocks* -- an inherently riskier investment -- is 10 percent?

<P>

So, what's so special about 6 percent? Why not 5 percent or even less? Naturally, the lower the interest rates, the better for the economy. However, 6 percent is about as low as 30-year bonds have gone since they were introduced in 1977. (The yield was at its lowest, 5.78 percent, in the fall of 1993.) 

<P>

John Silvia, chief economist for Zurich Kemper Investments, Inc., is among those who look for the 6 percent barrier to be broken over the long run. "Interest rates seem low to us because of recent history," Silvia says. "But when you consider our real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of approximately 2.5 percent and our approximate 3 percent inflation rate, rates ought to be about 5.5 or 5.75 percent. That's assuming that the Federal Reserve maintains its focus on reducing inflation over time and that the federal budget deficit is eliminated over the next several years. Investors earning above 6 percent are getting a fair return given these possible outcomes."

<P>

<I>*From 1928 through 1995, the <A HREF="http://www.stockinfo.standardpoor.com/brochure/idxdirs.htm">Standard & Poor's 500</A> returned an annual rate of 10.14 percent, according to Towers Data Systems. The S&P 500 is an unmanaged index that's generally considered representative of the U.S. stock market.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results -- but history can provide yet another way to consider the presidential prospects. In the table below, we've used Towers Data Systems data to review how the stock market performed in each presidential term since 1929. The <A HREF="http://www.stockinfo.standardpoor.com/idxinfo.htm">Standard & Poor's 500</A>, an unmanaged index of common stocks that's generally considered representative of the U.S. stock market, served as our proxy for stock market performance.

<BR>
8:30 A.M. EASTERN STANDARD TIME, THE FIRST FRIDAY OF EVERY MONTH: The Bureau of Labor Statistics, a division of the Labor Department, releases an <A HREF="ftp://STATS.bls.gov/pub/news.release/empsit.txt">employment situation report</A> that regularly influences the behavior of both the bond and equity markets in which mutual funds invest.
<P>
Using the data included in the report -- the unemployment rate, the size of nonfarm payrolls, average workweek and hourly earnings -- investors, economists and others make additional estimates about other aspects of the economy for which data are not yet available. These computations take place almost instantaneously and, within 15 minutes of the release of the report, the bond markets react to what the "news" is saying abut the economy.  By the time the stock markets open, within the hour, equity investors' reaction also will be apparent.
<P>
With the help of Zurich Kemper Investments, Inc. Chief Economist John Silvia, we've prepared a quick review of how information can be derived from the employment conditions report.

<B>Hours worked</B><BR>
An increase in the average hours worked in a week can indicate a business upturn -- employers usually extend the number of hours their current employees work as a prelude to hiring more.<BR>

<P>

<B>Industrial production</B> <I>(measured by an index)</I><BR>
Actual production figures are available later in the month, but early insights can be gained by reviewing the number of hours worked in the manufacturing sector.<BR>
<B>November 1996 level: 1.23<BR>Change: +0.4%</B> (estimate)

<B>Capacity utilization</B><BR>
This rate, the subject of its own report later in the month, seeks to measure the operating capacity of factories. At full capacity -- generally believed to be around 82 percent -- inflation has historically tended to rise.<BR>
<B>November 1996 level: 83.4%<BR>Change: +0.2%</B> (estimate)

<B>Gross domestic product (GDP)</B><BR>
Market observers track the change in gross domestic product (GDP) -- the dollar value of all goods and services produced in the United States -- as a measure of how fast the economy is growing. The Federal Reserve Board says it considers 2.5 percent to 3 percent an acceptable, noninflationary growth rate. Official GDP numbers are released and revised continually, but the employment conditions report makes it possible to do a quick calculation: Multiplying the number of people working X the average hours worked has produced a rough GDP that has historically been quite close to the GDP data released weeks and months later.<BR>

When assessing the return of your mutual fund investment, you must
consider it in context of the markets in which the fund strives to
perform.
<P>

The most widely quoted measure of the performance of the financial
markets is the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Unfortunately, "the Dow"
may provide very little insight on how your mutual fund investment is
progressing. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is a group of 30 blue chip
industrial stocks. 
<P>

More useful to you will be the performance of the particular index -- an
unmanaged group of similar investments -- that your mutual fund uses as
a benchmark for its investment objective. 
<P>

Comparing your fund against its index can be enlightening. Note, though,
that a fund's return will depend upon its specific investments. To
understand why your fund outperformed or underperformed its index, it
may also be helpful to compare the composition of your fund's portfolio
with the composition of the index over the same period of time.
Significant performance differences may arise if your fund and the index
were invested in different companies and industries throughout the
period. Other factors, such as cash flows in and out of a fund and fees
and expenses, may affect the relationship between fund performance and
the index.

<IMG SRC="gifs/prepared_vola_head.gif" ALT="Are You Prepared For More Volatility?">
<BR>
If investing in the stock market involved one single, uninterrupted
climb in prices, there would be no risk involved. But stock prices
cannot be counted on to rise and certainly not in an orderly way. They
surge and they fall. 
<P>

The range that the stock market covers in a given year - the difference
between its high and low for the year - is a measure of a year's
volatility. Over the 1978 to 1994 period, "average" volatility of the
<A HREF="http://www.stockinfo.standardpoor.com/brochure/idxdirs.htm">Standard & Poor's 500</A> was about 25 percent, according to an analysis by
Kemper's Quantitative Research Department. (The S&P 500 is an unmanaged
index that's generally considered representative of the domestic stock
market.)  Yet since 1992, markets have been much 
less volatile. For example, volatility in the stock market, as represented by
the <A HREF="http://www.dowjones.com/">Dow Jones Industrial Average</A>, was at a 95-year low in 1995, according to <I>Barron's.</I>
<P>

What's the significance of this? Kemper Portfolio Strategist Tom Regner
worries that such low levels of volatility have given investors -
especially new investors - unrealistic expectations about the degrees to
which their equity investments can fluctuate. Because the market has
historically been more volatile than its most recent performance, you
may want to give some thought to its potential for renewed volatility
and the impact volatility could have on your investments.
<P>

The following are a few suggestions on how you might prepare for
heightened stock market volatility:
<P>

<UL>
<LI> You could diversify. When you're concerned about your exposure in one
market, exposure to another market can help reduce the impact of
volatility. Instead of subjecting 100 percent of your portfolio to
what's going on in one market, a portion of your portfolio will move
with influences of a separate market.
<P>

Two other broad markets to invest in are the fixed-income markets and
international markets. Obviously, both represent their own risks and
potential rewards - and these markets can be volatile at times, as well.
For instance, the international markets present risks associated with
currency exchange rate fluctuations. However, you can help reduce the
riskiness of your investment strategy when you reduce your dependency on
a single market.
<P>

<LI> You could try to avoid volatility by moving some or a portion of your
investment in the stock market into a cash-type investment that seeks to
maintain the stability of the principal. A money market fund, for
example, is designed for investors who want to avoid the fluctuations
that are typical of the stock and bond markets. Although there can be no
assurance that it will, a money market fund seeks to maintain a stable
net asset value of $1.00 per share. Money market funds are neither
insured nor guaranteed by the U.S. government. 
<P>

Moving into such an investment can help limit your exposure to the
downside of volatility. The trade-off, however, is that you also will be
removed from benefiting when and if the market's volatility turns in the
investor's favor.
<P>

<LI> You could welcome volatility. Volatility has the potential to reward
the regular investor. Investors who prearrange to invest a fixed amount
into a mutual fund every month - regardless of the fund's share price -
can benefit from dips. How? When prices are low, your fixed investment
will buy more shares than could be bought when prices are high. Here's
the catch, however: The assumption is that the share price will bounce
back up and that you will still be invested if it does.
<P>

A program of regular investment cannot assure a profit or protect
against a loss in a declining market. Since this strategy (called dollar
cost averaging) involves continuing contributions regardless of
fluctuating share values, you'll need to consider your financial ability
to continue the program through periods of low price levels. For more

<DL><DT>

<IMG SRC = "gifs/forecast_head.gif" ALT = "A Weather Forcast for International Markets">
<BR>
At a time when many investors are looking overseas for their investment returns, some markets offer more promising weather than others. Dennis Ferro, director of international equities for Zurich Investment Management Limited, provides the following forecast for three markets likely to enjoy favorable conditions and three markets that you might want to avoid. (And, at all times, you'll want to follow this advisory: investment in international securities presents special risk considerations including exchange rates, government regulations and differences in liquidity. Be sure to talk to your financial representative for what's appropriate for your circumstances.)<P>


<IMG SRC = "gifs/forecast1_subhead.gif" ALT = "Ireland">
<BR>
One of the smallest foreign markets, Ireland in 1996 has several appeals. Moderate inflation should provide a conducive environment for its good quality, reasonably financed companies to become increasingly competitive on a global scale. Specifically, investors are attracted to its financial services, food processing and specialized manufacturing industries. Ireland's labor force is one of its significant competitive advantages: Workers are well educated and have a good work ethic. While there has been a correlation between the performance of the Irish market and the United Kingdom, Ireland's flexible work force and financial incentives have made it an attractive alternative. <P>

<IMG SRC = "gifs/forecast2_subhead.gif" ALT = "The Netherlands">
<BR> 
The Netherlands is an example of a foreign market whose positive fiscal policy has supported corporate progress. Both inflation and unemployment have been relatively low, and several solid companies have succeeded in building strong international businesses. Dutch companies are especially dominant in commercial publishing, electronics and growing software development and computer applications for European corporate needs. <P>

<IMG SRC = "gifs/forecast3_subhead.gif" ALT = "Japan">
<BR>
Having suffered a recession for the last five years, Japan should be the comeback story of 1996. The government is addressing its myriad problems (including banking, deregulation and trade), and many corporations have initiated steps to heighten their competitiveness. Increased corporate confidence in the system should result in a resumption of industrial production and capital expenditures - the very events needed for the economy's recovery. The health of Japan, the largest foreign market with a broad base of industries and strong infrastructure, has a direct effect on southeast Asia. Its improvement, then, could help the economies of Malaysia and Singapore.<P>

<IMG SRC = "gifs/forecast4_subhead.gif" ALT = "Germany">
<BR>
Concerns about inflation have kept German monetary policy tight for years. Consequently, interest rates have not fallen at the same pace that economic activity has. <P>

Opportunities in Germany's stock market tend to be large cyclical companies and financial institutions. German companies' ability to compete and expand profit margins is inhibited by relatively high compensation levels. This, combined with a strong deutsche mark, make it difficult for Germany's export industries to compete against products produced by countries with lower average wages.<P>

<IMG SRC = "gifs/forecast5_subhead.gif" ALT = "Russia">
<BR>
Just a few years ago, Russia represented untold potential. Many practicalities - including the government's taxation and regulation - have frustrated foreign investors, and growth has yet to occur as was predicted. IBM's recent cancellation of a manufacturing facility is just one sign that Russia is a market best avoided by the faint of heart.<P>

<IMG SRC = "gifs/forecast6_subhead.gif" ALT = "Brazil">
<BR>
Dramatic rallies draw investors to Latin American markets - but their volatility can also discourage investment. Brazil is an example of a market that has been strong recently, buoyed by an expanding economy heavily dependent on foreign financial support from the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. While the country has a developing manufacturing base and a strong resource sector, it is sensitive to export demand and global commodity prices. The health of Brazil's banking system remains suspect, and difficult political decisions must be made if continued progress is to occur. <P>

ALT="About Adobe Acrobat Files">
<BR>
Some documents on Kemper.com are available to you online in the Adobe
Acrobat Portable Document Format (.pdf). We make them available in this
format so the document you view or print on your own printer is
similar to the printed piece that you would
receive from your financial representative or Kemper Shareholder
Services. 
<BR><BR>

Adobe Acrobat files are universally available -- whether you're using
a Windows, DOS, Macintosh or Unix system, you can view and print the file
using the free Acrobat Reader. In order to access these or any other
Adobe Acrobat file available on Kemper.com, you will need to 
<A HREF="http://www.adobe.com/Acrobat/freeread.html"> Get
Acrobat</A> if it is not yet installed on your computer's hard drive.
Copying the Acrobat Reader should take no more than a few minutes. Once it's
installed on your hard drive, you will be able to click on all Adobe
Acrobat files and easily view or print.
<BR><BR>

Within the Acrobat Reader you can:
<UL TYPE=CIRCLE>
<LI> Scroll through the pages of the document
<LI> Print parts or all of the document
<LI> Zoom in and out 
<LI> Search for words 
</UL>

<BR>

After installing Adobe Acrobat on your hard drive, configure your Web
browser to use the Reader for .pdf files. You can either do it
immediately by setting up your viewer options (accessible via Helper
Apps in Netscape,
for example) to associate the file type "<CODE>application/pdf</CODE>" with the
Acrobat Reader. Or, you could wait until the first time that you
download a .pdf file, when your browser will prompt you through this
process.

<IMG SRC="gifs/aboutzki_head.gif" ALT="About Zurich Kemper Investments, Inc.">
<BR>


Kemper Funds originated in 1948, when five entrepreneurs formed a mutual fund to capitalize on a technological
breakthrough called television.  They started Television Shares Management Corporation, and introduced their first
mutual fund, the Television Fund - which focused on the success and technological advances related to the television
industry.  Over the years, that fund evolved to what is now known as <A HREF="../funds/technology.html">Kemper Technology
Fund.</A> 
<P>

In 1963, Television Shares Management Corporation was repositioned for broader appeal, taking on the new corporate
name Supervised Investors Services, Inc. ("SIS").  Through the 1960s, the company introduced three more mutual funds
-- Balanced Income Fund (now known as <A HREF="../funds/totalreturn.html">Kemper Total Return Fund</A>) which invested in both
stocks and bonds, Supervised Investors Growth Fund (now <A HREF="../funds/growth.html">Kemper Growth Fund</A>) and Summit Fund
(now <A HREF="../funds/smallcapequity.html">Kemper Small Capitalization Equity Fund</A>).  
<P>

In 1970, Kemper Corporation acquired all the outstanding stock of SIS, and successfully combined the predominantly
fixed-income expertise of Kemper with the solid equity management of SIS.  Through the 1970s, the company diversified
its product line, adding <A HREF="../funds/preservation.html">Kemper Income and Capital Preservation Fund</A>, an
investment-grade bond fund, and <A HREF="../funds/money_market.html">Kemper Money Market Fund</A>, one of the nation's first
money market funds.  
<P>


SIS became Kemper Financial Services, Inc. in 1976.  That same year, Kemper pioneered a fully managed tax-exempt
income fund, <A HREF="../funds/muni_bond.html">Kemper Municipal Bond Fund</A> -- the nation's first municipal bond fund. 
Kemper was also one of the first in the industry to offer government securities portfolios.  More recently, Kemper
introduced its <A HREF="../funds/retire_series.html">Retirement Fund Series</A>, which combines zero-coupon bonds and equity
securities, and <A HREF="../funds/valuegrowth.html">Kemper Value+Growth Fund</A>, which combines both value and growth stocks
in the same portfolio using the expertise of two separate and distinct investment managers.  
<P>


In January 1996, Kemper Financial Services became part of the Zurich family and, in March 1996,  took the name Zurich
Kemper Investments, Inc. ("ZKI").  As investment manager of the Kemper Funds, ZKI is one of the nation's largest asset
managers.  The Kemper Funds family is comprised of more than 70 portfolios including growth- and value-style equity
funds, international funds, U.S. government and corporate bond funds, municipal bond funds, money market funds and
closed-end funds.  Together, this adds up to over $45 billion in assets and more than 3 million shareholder accounts.
<P>

You may <A HREF="../prospectus.html">download a Kemper Funds prospectus now</A>, request one from your financial
representative or call Kemper Shareholder Services at 1-800-621-1048.  The prospectuses contain more complete
information including management fees and expenses.  Please read them carefully before you invest or send money.

<IMG SRC="gifs/introkemper_head.gif" ALT="Introducing Kemper Funds">
<BR>

Kemper Funds strive to provide high-quality asset management based on teamwork,
a clearly defined investment style and thorough research.  Below, you'll find
some general information about the types of funds managed by <A
HREF="aboutzki.html">Zurich Kemper Investments, Inc.</A> and our investment
philosophy.  
<P>

<IMG SRC="gifs/introkemper1_subhead.gif" ALT="Kemper Money Funds">
<BR>

Kemper Money Funds feature a conservative approach to money management,
emphasizing stability of principal, competitive long-term returns and easy
liquidity.  And Kemper Money Funds can be used for a variety of purposes -- an
emergency fund, rainy day savings, short-term investment goals, or a temporary
"parking place" for your money while you decide where to invest.  With more than
$5 billion in assets under management and a track record spanning more than 20
years, Kemper Money Funds offer investors the confidence that comes with
experience.  
<P>

<A HREF="../funds/mmfunds.html">Kemper Money Funds</A> offer a choice of three
portfolios:
<P>
<UL>

<LI> <A HREF="../funds/money_market.html">Kemper Money Market Fund</A> invests primarily
in short-term, high-quality obligations of major banks and corporations.
<P>

<LI> <A HREF="../funds/govt_sec_port.html">Kemper Government Money Fund</A> adds an extra
degree of safety by investing only in U.S. Treasury securities and other
obligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government or its agencies and
related repurchase agreements.
<P>

<LI> <A HREF="../funds/tax_exempt.html">Kemper Tax-Free Money Fund</A> offers current
income that is exempt from federal income taxes* by investing in short-term,
high-quality municipal securities. 
<P>
</UL>

A Kemper Money Funds investment also offers a variety of access features,
including checkwriting and the MoneyPLUS cash management feature.  Consult the
<A HREF="../prospectus.html">prospectus</A> for details, including fees for the
MoneyPLUS feature, or call Kemper Shareholder Services at 1-800-621-1048. 
<P>
 
<IMG SRC="gifs/introkemper2_subhead.gif" ALT="Kemper Income Funds">
<BR>

We believe few fund companies can match Kemper's time-tested experience,
research capabilities and presence in today's sophisticated bond market.  Kemper
has spent over 20 years managing income mutual funds.  That's longer than 94% of
all mutual fund companies. **
<P>

In the high yield arena alone, Kemper manages over $3.5 billion.  And with over
$8 billion in U.S. government funds assets, Kemper is a prominent presence in
the government securities marketplace. 
<P>

In managing the <A HREF="../funds/income.html">Income Funds</A>, we emphasize credit and
sector analysis, seeking to balance a competitive current yield with
opportunities for total return.  Subject to the particular policies of a
portfolio, our management team employs flexibility to shift among corporate,
treasury and mortgage-backed securities as opportunities and market conditions
warrant and as applicable portfolio policies and restrictions permit. 
<P>




<IMG SRC="gifs/introkemper3_subhead.gif" ALT="Kemper Tax-Free Income Funds">
<BR>

Recognizing the need for investments that offer tax-free income*, Kemper created
America's first tax-free mutual fund, <A HREF="../funds/muni_bond.html">Kemper Municipal
Bond Fund</A>, back in 1976.  Today, Kemper manages over $5.0 billion of
tax-free mutual fund assets.    
<P>

In managing its tax-free investments, Kemper emphasizes quality.  Each of the
portfolios holds at least 90% of assets in investment-grade bonds. 
<P>

<IMG SRC="gifs/introkemper4_subhead.gif" ALT="Kemper Capital Growth Funds">
<BR>
Of the more than 500 companies that offer mutual funds, more than 80% don't have
a single equity fund that's over 25 years old, according to Lipper Analytical
Services, Inc. (as of 12/31/95).  Kemper has three -- and each has provided
investors with outstanding long-term performance.  Kemper <A
HREF="../funds/capgrowth.html">Capital Growth Funds</A> also offer style diversification,
from two separate and distinctly specialized investment managers: growth-style
management from Zurich Kemper Investments, Inc., and value-style management from
Dreman Value Advisors, Inc.***  Of course, there is no guarantee that a
particular management style will be successful. 
<P>

On the growth side, Zurich Kemper Investments, Inc. emphasizes "growth at the
right price."  Using a disciplined team approach, Kemper analysts use
fundamental research to identify quality growth companies whose stocks are
selling at reasonable prices and whose earnings are growing faster than the
market average.  Characteristics of these companies include strong management,
industry leadership, a high return on equity, a low dividend/high reinvestment
rate and recession resistance.  Stocks must pass an intensive screening process
based on relative price/earnings ratios, relative profitability, present values
and momentum characteristics.
<P>

In evaluating value stocks, Dreman Value Advisors, Inc. focuses on companies
that are out of favor with investors because the market underestimates their
value or overlooks their potential.  Stocks become undervalued as a result of
overreaction by investors to unfavorable news about a company, industry or the
stock market in general.  Or, they can become undervalued as a result of a
market decline, poor economic conditions, tax-loss selling or actual or
anticipated unfavorable developments affecting the company.  Because the company
is out of favor, its stock trades at a price/earning ratio (P/E) that is lower
than its potential might suggest.  P/Es of value stocks are generally lower than
the overall market and lower than growth stock P/Es. 
<P>

<IMG SRC="gifs/introkemper5_subhead.gif" ALT="Kemper Horizon Fund">
<BR>

Few investors have 100 percent of their funds in stocks or 100 percent in the
bond market.  Deciding how much to invest in each -- an ongoing process called
asset allocation -- could be the most important investment decision you'll make. 
An important consideration is how soon will you need your invested dollars.  A
financial representative can help you answer that question, as well as other
considerations such as your specific investment objectives and risk tolerance. 
When you have, Kemper Horizon Fund can help by providing three diversified
portfolios of equity and fixed income securities designed for investors with
different investment horizons.
<P>

<A HREF="../funds/horiz20.html">Kemper Horizon 20+ Portfolio</A> emphasizes growth of
capital with income generation as a secondary objective.  <A
HREF="../funds/horiz10.html">Kemper Horizon 10+ Portfolio</A> seeks a balance of growth
and income with moderate risk.  And <A HREF="../funds/horiz5.html">Kemper Horizon 5
Portfolio</A> seeks income while your capital is being preserved, with growth of
capital as a secondary objective. For more information, <A
HREF="../prospectus.html">download a prospectus now.</A>
<P>
   
<IMG SRC="gifs/introkemper6_subhead.gif" ALT="Kemper International and Global
Funds">
<BR>

Kemper's London-based management team has a worldwide network of investment
contacts that provides greater access to foreign markets. This allows for a
better understanding of each market, and a closer examination of growth rates,
market niches, balance sheets, and even local issues. Our global research
efforts for <A HREF="../funds/intlglobal.html">Kemper International and Global Funds</A>
cover hundreds of foreign companies, as well as contact with banks, investment
houses and economists worldwide. 
<P>

<FONT SIZE=2>
Returns and net asset values fluctuate.  Shares are not insured or guaranteed
and are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or less than
original cost.  Kemper Money Market Fund seeks to maintain a net asset value of
$1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that it will.  Money Fund shares
are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. government.
<P>

Investment by certain portfolios in lower rated and non-rated securities
presents a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher rated
securities (principally Kemper Diversified Income Fund and Kemper High Yield
Fund).  For portfolios that invest internationally (principally Kemper
International Fund, Kemper Global Income Fund and Kemper Diversified Income
Fund) there are special risk considerations, including foreign exchange rates,
foreign government regulations and differing degrees of liquidity that may
adversely affect portfolio securities, all of which are more fully discussed in
the funds' prospectuses.
<P>

Investment in smaller companies (Kemper Small Capitalization Equity and
Kemper-Dreman Small Cap Value Funds) presents greater risk of loss than
investment in large companies.  Concentration in certain market sectors
(Kemper-Dreman High Return) presents special risk considerations.   
<P>

*  Except as otherwise described in the prospectus, income from tax-free funds
may be subject to state and local taxes and, for some investors, the alternative
minimum tax.

Kemper has been an industry leader in developing innovative mutual 
fund concepts:
<P>

<UL TYPE=CIRCLE>
<LI>
<A HREF="../funds/mmfunds.html">Kemper Money Market Fund</A> was one of the nation's first money market
funds. (1974)

<LI>
<A HREF="../funds/muni_bond.html">Kemper Municipal Bond Fund</A> was 
the nation's first municipal bond mutual fund. (1976)

<LI>
Kemper Investment Portfolios was one of the first 12-b1 fund families,
enabling investors to invest 100 percent of their money upfront and pay
the cost of distribution over time. (1984).

<LI>
KemFlex was one of the first sophisticated retirement plan recordkeeping
systems to be introduced by a mutual fund distributor, thereby
simplifying plan administration and reducing plan cost. (1988)

<LI>
Kemper addressed the long-term goals - and security concerns - of many
investors with the introduction of the <A HREF="../funds/retire_series.html"> 
Kemper Retirement Fund</A> series,
which guarantees the return of original investments at a set date if
held until maturity and dividends are reinvested. (Investors who redeem
prior to maturity or do not reinvest dividends do not benefit from the
guarantee.) (1990)

<LI>
With PREFERRED K, Kemper created an integrated turnkey approach for
implementing cost-effective 401(k) programs. (1991)

<LI>
Kemper introduced a worldwide fund with the guaranteed return of the
original investment at maturity - <A HREF="../funds/worldwide.html">
Kemper Worldwide 2004 Fund</A>. (Investors
who redeem prior to maturity or do not reinvest dividends do not benefit
from the guarantee). (1994)

When assessing the return of your mutual fund investment, you should
consider it in context of the markets in which the fund strives to
perform.
<BR><BR>

The most widely quoted measure of the performance of the financial
markets is the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Unfortunately, "the Dow"
may provide very little insight on how your mutual fund investment is
progressing. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is a group of 30 blue chip
industrial stocks. 
<BR><BR>

More useful to you will be the performance of the particular index - an
unmanaged group of similar investments - that your mutual fund uses as
a benchmark for its investment objective. 
<BR><BR>

Comparing your fund against its index can be enlightening. Note, though,
that a fund's return will depend upon its specific investments. To
understand why your fund outperformed or underperformed its index, it
may also be helpful to compare the composition of your fund's portfolio
with the composition of the index over the same period of time.
Significant performance differences may arise if your fund and the index
were invested in different companies and industries throughout the
period. Other factors, such as cash flows in and out of a fund and fees
and expenses, may affect the relationship between fund performance and
the index.
<BR><BR>

<STRONG>Which broad market index would you like to compare your fund's 
performance against?</STRONG> (The graph will present the comparative
total returns for Class A shares of your fund for the last 10 years 
and year-to-date, through the most recent quarter end, unadjusted for 
a <A HREF="salescharges.html">sales charge</A>. Multiple classes not 
available for Kemper Worldwide 2004 Fund and Kemper Retirement Fund;
fund performance shown.)

Of all the decisions you'll make about investing, this may be one of the biggest: Growth or Value?
<P>
When it comes to stock investing, there are two ways to take the bull by the horns, two well-known styles of equity management -- growth and value. Both offer a long-term, disciplined approach to capital appreciation, but the two styles go about their business in fundamentally different ways.
<P>
Growth or value? Is one style better than the other? It's an important decision, one that every investor should consider. And yet, many continue to seesaw between styles, an approach that too often misses the bull's-eye.

<BR>
Concerns about rising interest rates, the
possibility of higher price inflation and Federal Reserve tightening
of credit continue to contribute to considerable market volatility. But while
the professional investors  tend to debate every economic release,
individuals who invest in mutual funds for the long term have been
wise to stay the course. Indeed, several recent economic measures
are quite reassuring and argue in favor of a continued healthy
economy with low inflation.
<P>
The economy expanded at a 4.2% annual rate in the second quarter,
the fastest pace since the second quarter of 1994. This robust
growth is welcome in general but has tended to roil markets, which
fear strong growth will lead to overheating and inflationary pressures.
So far, however, such fears have been largely unwarranted. With
the exception of food prices, whose increases were weather-related,
there have been no significant signs of inflationary pressures.
As it has so often recently, the economy is in the process of
slowing itself down. While the Federal Reserve Board stands by
ready to attempt to moderate economic growth with either interest
rate cuts or increases, such intervention can run the risk of
going too far in one direction. It appears that our economy today
is self-regulating.
<P>
Based on these snapshots of the economy, then, we look for a relatively
calmer remainder of the year. Our forecast calls for growth to slow
down in the fourth quarter, to result in an advance
of about 2.5% for the entire year. Assuming that bond and stock
market investors concur that there is no chance of an overheating
economy or significantly rising interest rates, the markets should
relax, as well. 
<P>
Our market forecast 10 months into the year is not much different
from what we forecasted in January. The bond market, which is
climbing back from a decline this year, may produce a 5% total
return in 1996. The stock market, after the correction is completed,
may advance 10% to 15% for the year. Naturally, future market conditions
cannot be predicted with assurance.
<P>
In addition, we are projecting that long-term (30-year) interest
rates will hover in the 6.5% to 7.0% range. Short-term interest
rates may drop below their current levels. Finally, we would be
surprised if the Federal Reserve Board moved to adjust interest
rates either way more than 25 basis points for the remainder of
the year.
<P>
Given the economic environment, we do not look for an upset in
the upcoming presidential election. Much more interesting will
be which party wins the most congressional seats. If the Democrats
regain control of Congress, a bond market selloff could be expected.
<P>
While U.S. markets are expected to provide modest returns, we
continue to advocate the benefits of diversification into alternate
markets. Many overseas markets are forecasted to grow at a rate
well above our 2.5% growth expectation for the U.S., and there
are many equity and fixed-income opportunities abroad. The value
of the U.S. dollar, always a concern to international investors,
will probably not strengthen much against other currencies for
the foreseeable future.
<P>
Thank you for your continued support. We appreciate the opportunity to serve your investment
needs.

# Portfolios are subject to
change. <BR> ## These figures are adjusted for maximum
sales charge (Class A) or the contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC) in
effect at the end of the specified period (Class B). The maximum initial
sales charge (Class A) is 5.75% for Kemper-Dreman High Return Fund. The CDSC schedule
for Class B shares for years 1 to 6 is 4%, 3%, 3%, 2%, 2% and 1%.
Adjustment for a full annual period is at CDSC for the next annual level.
Thus, 1-year returns are adjusted for 3% CDSC.  For Class C shares, performance is
adjusted for the 1% CDSC for shares redeemed within the year.  Sales charges are reduced
or eliminated under certain conditions as described in the funds'
prospectuses.

that there is no assurance that the objective of any mutual fund will
be achieved and mutual fund returns and net asset value fluctuate.
Shares are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or
less than their original cost. Money market funds seek to maintain a

<B>Performance And Yield Notes</B>
<BR>
Returns are historical and do not represent future performance. Returns
and net asset values fluctuate. Shares
are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or less
than the original cost. Kemper Money Funds seek to maintain a net asset
value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that they will.
Fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. government.
<P>

Average annual total return and total return measure net investment
income and capital gain or loss from portfolio investments, assuming reinvestment
of dividends and, for average annual total return only, adjustments for the maximum
sales charge or the contingent deferred sales charge in effect at the end of the periods,
as applicable.  Average annual
total return reflects annualized change while total return reflects
aggregate change. During the periods noted, securities prices
fluctuated. For each money market fund, the current annualized yield is
the seven day annualized net investment income per share as of the
indicated date. Gains or losses are not included. Effective yield
reflects compounding of income.
<P>

<B>Special Risks</B>
<BR>
Investment by certain portfolios in lower rated and non-rated securities
presents a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher
rated securities (principally Kemper Diversified Income Fund and Kemper
High Yield Fund). For portfolios that invest internationally
(principally Kemper International Fund, Kemper Global Income Fund, Kemper
Europe Fund, Kemper Diversified Income Fund, Kemper Asian Growth Fund
and Kemper Worldwide 2004 Fund), there
are special risk considerations, including foreign exchange rates,
foreign government regulations and differing degrees of liquidity that
may adversely affect portfolio securities, all of which are more fully
discussed in the funds' prospectuses. 
Investment in smaller companies (Kemper Small Capitalization Equity Fund
and Kemper-Dreman Small Cap Value Fund) presents greater risk of loss
than investment in large companies. Concentration in certain market
sectors (Kemper-Dreman High Return Fund) presents special risk
considerations.
<P>

Performance of funds may be compared to the performance of various
unmanaged indices including, but not limited to: the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index and the Dow
Jones Industrial Average, which are generally representative of the U.S.
stock market; the Wilshire Large Company Growth Index, which is
generally representative of the market for stocks of larger growth
companies (selected on the basis of sales growth, return on equity and
dividend payout); the Lehman Brothers Government/Corporate Bond index,
which is generally representative of intermediate and long-term
government and investment grade corporate debt securities; the Morgan
Stanley Capital International EAFE, which is generally representative of
international markets; the FT/S&amp;P - Actuaries World Index - Europe, which 
is generally representative of the equity securities of European companies; the Consumer Price Index, generally
representative of the level of inflation; the Salomon Brothers World
Government Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index on a U.S. dollar total return basis with all dividends reinvested and is comprised of government bonds from 14 countries; the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index generally representative of intermediate-term government 
bonds, investment grade corporate debt securities and mortgage-backed
securities; the Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index, which includes
approximately 15,000 bonds; the Russell 1000 Growth Index, which is an 
unmanaged index comprised of common stocks of larger U.S. companies with 
greater than average growth orientation and represents the universe of
stocks from which "earnings/growth" money managers typically select; and the
Russell 2000 index, which is an unmanaged capitalization weighted price only 
index which is comprised of 2000 of the smallest stocks in the Russell
3000 index. The performance of funds may also be compared to the combined performance of several indices.
<P>

Returns for Kemper Asian Growth Fund, Kemper Value+Growth Fund, Kemper-Dreman Funds and Kemper Europe Fund include the effect of a temporary waiver of
management fees and/or an absorption of certain operating expenses by Zurich 
Kemper Investments, Inc., as investment advisor, for periods
specified in the prospectus, which improved results. The absorption and
waiver for certain Kemper State Tax-Free Income Funds has been reinstated. Income from
tax-exempt funds may be subject to state and local taxes except as
otherwise provided in the prospectus, and a portion of income may be
subject to the alternative minimum tax for certain investors.

<FONT SIZE=-1># Portfolios are subject
to change.<BR> ## These figures are adjusted for maximum
sales charge (Class A) or the contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC) in
effect at the end of the specified period (Class B). The maximum initial
sales charge (Class A) is 5.75% for Kemper Growth Fund. The CDSC schedule
for Class B shares for years 1 to 6 is 4%, 3%, 3%, 2%, 2% and 1%.
Adjustment for a full annual period is at CDSC for the next annual level.
Thus, 1-year returns are adjusted for 3% CDSC. Sales charges are reduced
or eliminated under certain conditions as described in the funds'
prospectuses.

For more complete information on any Kemper Fund, including management
fees and expenses, please request a free prospectus from your
financial representative, Kemper Shareholder Services (1-800-621-1048), 
<A HREF="../prospectus_email.html">
e-mail us your request</A> for a prospectus through the mail or

<P>

Read the prospectus carefully before you invest or send money. Remember
that there is no assurance that the objective of any mutual fund will
be achieved and mutual fund returns and net asset value fluctuate.
Shares are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or
less than their original cost. Money market funds seek to maintain a
net asset value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that
they will. Mutual fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. 
government. 

<P>

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<B>Performance And Yield Notes</B>
<BR>
Returns are historical and do not represent future performance. Returns
and net asset values fluctuate. Shares
are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or less
than the original cost. Kemper Money Funds seek to maintain a net asset
value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that they will.
Fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. government.
<P>

Average annual total return and total return measure net investment
income and capital gain or loss from portfolio investments, assuming reinvestment
of dividends and, for average annual total return only, adjustments for the maximum
sales charge or the contingent deferred sales charge in effect at the end of the periods,
as applicable.  Average annual
total return reflects annualized change while total return reflects
aggregate change. During the periods noted, securities prices
fluctuated. For each money market fund, the current annualized yield is
the seven day annualized net investment income per share as of the
indicated date. Gains or losses are not included. Effective yield
reflects compounding of income.
<P>

<B>Special Risks</B>
<BR>
Investment by certain portfolios in lower rated and non-rated securities
presents a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher
rated securities (principally Kemper Diversified Income Fund and Kemper
High Yield Fund). For portfolios that invest internationally
(principally Kemper International Fund, Kemper Global Income Fund, Kemper
Europe Fund, Kemper Diversified Income Fund, Kemper Asian Growth Fund
and Kemper Worldwide 2004 Fund), there
are special risk considerations, including foreign exchange rates,
foreign government regulations and differing degrees of liquidity that
may adversely affect portfolio securities, all of which are more fully
discussed in the funds' prospectuses. 
Investment in smaller companies (Kemper Small Capitalization Equity Fund
and Kemper-Dreman Small Cap Value Fund) presents greater risk of loss
than investment in large companies. Concentration in certain market
sectors (Kemper-Dreman High Return Fund) presents special risk
considerations.
<P>

Performance of funds may be compared to the performance of various
unmanaged indices including, but not limited to: the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index and the Dow
Jones Industrial Average, which are generally representative of the U.S.
stock market; the Wilshire Large Company Growth Index, which is
generally representative of the market for stocks of larger growth
companies (selected on the basis of sales growth, return on equity and
dividend payout); the Lehman Brothers Government/Corporate Bond index,
which is generally representative of intermediate and long-term
government and investment grade corporate debt securities; the Morgan
Stanley Capital International EAFE, which is generally representative of
international markets; the FT/S&amp;P - Actuaries World Index - Europe, which 
is generally representative of the equity securities of European companies; the Consumer Price Index, generally
representative of the level of inflation; the Salomon Brothers World
Government Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index on a U.S. dollar total return basis with all dividends reinvested and is comprised of government bonds from 14 countries; the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index generally representative of intermediate-term government 
bonds, investment grade corporate debt securities and mortgage-backed
securities; the Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index, which includes
approximately 15,000 bonds; the Russell 1000 Growth Index, which is an 
unmanaged index comprised of common stocks of larger U.S. companies with 
greater than average growth orientation and represents the universe of
stocks from which "earnings/growth" money managers typically select; and the
Russell 2000 index, which is an unmanaged capitalization weighted price only 
index which is comprised of 2000 of the smallest stocks in the Russell
3000 index. The performance of funds may also be compared to the combined performance of several indices.
<P>

Returns for Kemper Asian Growth Fund, Kemper Value+Growth Fund, Kemper-Dreman Funds and Kemper Europe Fund include the effect of a temporary waiver of
management fees and/or an absorption of certain operating expenses by Zurich 
Kemper Investments, Inc., as investment advisor, for periods
specified in the prospectus, which improved results. The absorption and
waiver for certain Kemper State Tax-Free Income Funds has been reinstated. Income from
tax-exempt funds may be subject to state and local taxes except as
otherwise provided in the prospectus, and a portion of income may be
subject to the alternative minimum tax for certain investors.

fees and expenses, please request a free prospectus from your
financial representative, Kemper Shareholder Services (1-800-621-1048),

<P>

Read the prospectus carefully before you invest or send money. Remember
that there is no assurance that the objective of any mutual fund will
be achieved and mutual fund returns and net asset value fluctuate.
Shares are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or
less than their original cost. Money market funds seek to maintain a
net asset value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that
they will. Mutual fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. 
government.

<B>Performance And Yield Notes</B>
<BR>
Returns are historical and do not represent future performance. Returns
and net asset values fluctuate. Shares
are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or less
than the original cost. Kemper Money Funds seek to maintain a net asset
value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that they will.
Fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. government.
<P>

Average annual total return and total return measure net investment
income and capital gain or loss from portfolio investments, assuming reinvestment
of dividends and, for average annual total return only, adjustments for the maximum
sales charge or the contingent deferred sales charge in effect at the end of the periods,
as applicable.  Average annual
total return reflects annualized change while total return reflects
aggregate change. During the periods noted, securities prices
fluctuated. For each money market fund, the current annualized yield is
the seven day annualized net investment income per share as of the
indicated date. Gains or losses are not included. Effective yield
reflects compounding of income.
<P>

<B>Special Risks</B>
<BR>
Investment by certain portfolios in lower rated and non-rated securities
presents a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher
rated securities (principally Kemper Diversified Income Fund and Kemper
High Yield Fund). For portfolios that invest internationally
(principally Kemper International Fund, Kemper Global Income Fund, Kemper
Europe Fund, Kemper Diversified Income Fund, Kemper Asian Growth Fund
and Kemper Worldwide 2004 Fund), there
are special risk considerations, including foreign exchange rates,
foreign government regulations and differing degrees of liquidity that
may adversely affect portfolio securities, all of which are more fully
discussed in the funds' prospectuses. 
Investment in smaller companies (Kemper Small Capitalization Equity Fund
and Kemper-Dreman Small Cap Value Fund) presents greater risk of loss
than investment in large companies. Concentration in certain market
sectors (Kemper-Dreman High Return Fund) presents special risk
considerations.
<P>

Performance of funds may be compared to the performance of various
unmanaged indices including, but not limited to: the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index and the Dow
Jones Industrial Average, which are generally representative of the U.S.
stock market; the Wilshire Large Company Growth Index, which is
generally representative of the market for stocks of larger growth
companies (selected on the basis of sales growth, return on equity and
dividend payout); the Lehman Brothers Government/Corporate Bond index,
which is generally representative of intermediate and long-term
government and investment grade corporate debt securities; the Morgan
Stanley Capital International EAFE, which is generally representative of
international markets; the FT/S&amp;P - Actuaries World Index - Europe, which 
is generally representative of the equity securities of European companies; the Consumer Price Index, generally
representative of the level of inflation; the Salomon Brothers World
Government Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index on a U.S. dollar total return basis with all dividends reinvested and is comprised of government bonds from 14 countries; the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index generally representative of intermediate-term government 
bonds, investment grade corporate debt securities and mortgage-backed
securities; the Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index, which includes
approximately 15,000 bonds; the Russell 1000 Growth Index, which is an 
unmanaged index comprised of common stocks of larger U.S. companies with 
greater than average growth orientation and represents the universe of
stocks from which "earnings/growth" money managers typically select; and the
Russell 2000 index, which is an unmanaged capitalization weighted price only 
index which is comprised of 2000 of the smallest stocks in the Russell
3000 index. The performance of funds may also be compared to the combined performance of several indices.
<P>

Returns for Kemper Asian Growth Fund, Kemper Value+Growth Fund, Kemper-Dreman Funds and Kemper Europe Fund include the effect of a temporary waiver of
management fees and/or an absorption of certain operating expenses by Zurich 
Kemper Investments, Inc., as investment advisor, for periods
specified in the prospectus, which improved results. The absorption and
waiver for certain Kemper State Tax-Free Income Funds has been reinstated. Income from
tax-exempt funds may be subject to state and local taxes except as
otherwise provided in the prospectus, and a portion of income may be
subject to the alternative minimum tax for certain investors.

# Portfolios are subject to change. <BR> 
## These figures are adjusted for maximum sales charge (Class A) or the
contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC) in effect at the end of the
specified period (Class B). The maximum initial sales charge (Class A)
is 5.75% for Kemper-Dreman Contrarian Fund. The CDSC schedule for Class B shares for
years 1 to 6 is 4%, 3%, 3%, 2%, 2% and 1%. Adjustment for a full
annual period is at CDSC for the next annual level. Thus, 1-year returns are
adjusted for 3% CDSC.  For Class C shares, performance is adjusted for the 1% CDSC for
shares redeemed within one year.  Sales charges are reduced or eliminated under
certain conditions as described in the funds' prospectuses.

These figures are adjusted for maximum sales charge (Class A) or the
contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC) in effect at the end of the
specified period (Class B). The maximum initial sales charge (Class A)
is 5.75% for Kemper-Dreman Small Cap Value Fund. The CDSC schedule for Class B
shares for years 1 to 6 is 4%, 3%, 3%, 2%, 2% and 1%. Adjustment for a full annual
period is at CDSC for the next annual level. Thus, 1-year returns are
adjusted for 3% CDSC. For Class C shares, performance is adjusted for the 1% CDSC for 
shares 
redeemed within one quarter.  Sales charges are reduced or eliminated under
certain conditions as described in the funds' prospectuses.

Read the prospectus carefully before you invest or send money. Remember
that there is no assurance that the objective of any mutual fund will
be achieved and mutual fund returns and net asset value fluctuate.
Shares are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or
less than their original cost. Money market funds seek to maintain a
net asset value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that
they will. Mutual fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. 
government.

<B>Performance And Yield Notes</B>
<BR>
Returns are historical and do not represent future performance. Returns
and net asset values fluctuate. Shares
are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or less
than the original cost. Kemper Money Funds seek to maintain a net asset
value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that they will.
Fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. government.
<P>

Average annual total return and total return measure net investment
income and capital gain or loss from portfolio investments, assuming reinvestment
of dividends and, for average annual total return only, adjustments for the maximum
sales charge or the contingent deferred sales charge in effect at the end of the periods,
as applicable.  Average annual
total return reflects annualized change while total return reflects
aggregate change. During the periods noted, securities prices
fluctuated. For each money market fund, the current annualized yield is
the seven day annualized net investment income per share as of the
indicated date. Gains or losses are not included. Effective yield
reflects compounding of income.
<P>

<B>Special Risks</B>
<BR>
Investment by certain portfolios in lower rated and non-rated securities
presents a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher
rated securities (principally Kemper Diversified Income Fund and Kemper
High Yield Fund). For portfolios that invest internationally
(principally Kemper International Fund, Kemper Global Income Fund, Kemper
Europe Fund, Kemper Diversified Income Fund, Kemper Asian Growth Fund
and Kemper Worldwide 2004 Fund), there
are special risk considerations, including foreign exchange rates,
foreign government regulations and differing degrees of liquidity that
may adversely affect portfolio securities, all of which are more fully
discussed in the funds' prospectuses. 
Investment in smaller companies (Kemper Small Capitalization Equity Fund
and Kemper-Dreman Small Cap Value Fund) presents greater risk of loss
than investment in large companies. Concentration in certain market
sectors (Kemper-Dreman High Return Fund) presents special risk
considerations.
<P>

Performance of funds may be compared to the performance of various
unmanaged indices including, but not limited to: the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index and the Dow
Jones Industrial Average, which are generally representative of the U.S.
stock market; the Wilshire Large Company Growth Index, which is
generally representative of the market for stocks of larger growth
companies (selected on the basis of sales growth, return on equity and
dividend payout); the Lehman Brothers Government/Corporate Bond index,
which is generally representative of intermediate and long-term
government and investment grade corporate debt securities; the Morgan
Stanley Capital International EAFE, which is generally representative of
international markets; the FT/S&amp;P - Actuaries World Index - Europe, which 
is generally representative of the equity securities of European companies; the Consumer Price Index, generally
representative of the level of inflation; the Salomon Brothers World
Government Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index on a U.S. dollar total return basis with all dividends reinvested and is comprised of government bonds from 14 countries; the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index generally representative of intermediate-term government 
bonds, investment grade corporate debt securities and mortgage-backed
securities; the Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index, which includes
approximately 15,000 bonds; the Russell 1000 Growth Index, which is an 
unmanaged index comprised of common stocks of larger U.S. companies with 
greater than average growth orientation and represents the universe of
stocks from which "earnings/growth" money managers typically select; and the
Russell 2000 index, which is an unmanaged capitalization weighted price only 
index which is comprised of 2000 of the smallest stocks in the Russell
3000 index. The performance of funds may also be compared to the combined performance of several indices.
<P>

Returns for Kemper Asian Growth Fund, Kemper Value+Growth Fund, Kemper-Dreman Funds and Kemper Europe Fund include the effect of a temporary waiver of
management fees and/or an absorption of certain operating expenses by Zurich 
Kemper Investments, Inc., as investment advisor, for periods
specified in the prospectus, which improved results. The absorption and
waiver for certain Kemper State Tax-Free Income Funds has been reinstated. Income from
tax-exempt funds may be subject to state and local taxes except as
otherwise provided in the prospectus, and a portion of income may be
subject to the alternative minimum tax for certain investors.

<H3>KEMPER FUNDS GROUP JOINS SCHWAB'S INSTITUTIONAL ONESOURCE</H3>
<P>
<B>CHICAGO</B> (October 31) --Kemper Funds management today announced
that it has signed an agreement with Charles Schwab &amp; Co.
to offer Class A shares of 22 mutual funds at net asset value
through Schwab's Institutional OneSource program. Kemper recently
began offering its funds to advisors at net asset value through
Fidelity's Institutional FundsNetwork and Jack White &amp; Co.'s
NoFee Network, and is currently in negotiations with several other
fund &quot;supermarket&quot; programs.
<P>
&quot;Schwab's Institutional OneSource was the next logical step
for us in gaining a stronger foothold in the burgeoning fee-based
advisory channel,&quot; said John Norris, first vice president
and head of the registered investment advisor unit at Kemper Distributors,
Inc., the principal underwriter and distributor for the Kemper
Funds. &quot;In order to be well-positioned in the future, we
need to form relationships with established distribution outlets
that cater to this very important and growing segment of our business.
Schwab is a market leader in providing registered investment advisors
with superior back-office services, so it was very natural for
us to gravitate toward them.&quot;
<P>
Norris emphasized that Kemper remains fully committed to selling
its funds through investment professionals. &quot;We believe in
the power of financial advice and we will continue to expand distribution
relationships with programs where financial advisors are providing
their services to customers.&quot;
<P>
<A HREF="../aboutzki.html">Zurich Kemper Investments, Inc.</A> (ZKI), is the investment advisor
to the <A HREF="../aboutkemper.html"> Kemper Funds</A>, which consists of 30 open-end funds with
over 70 portfolios and seven closed-end funds. Kemper Funds has
nearly $45 billion in assets. ZKI is part of Zurich Insurance
Group, a global organization headquartered in Zurich, Switzerland,
that provides services in life and property-casualty insurance,
reinsurance and asset management in more than 45 countries.

<H3>KEMPER FUNDS SURVEY FINDS TWO OUT OF THREE &quot;EMPTY NESTERS&quot;
GAIN $5,000+ ANNUAL BOOST WHEN KIDS FLY THE COOP; 
DESPITE CONCERNS  ABOUT THE FUTURE, FEW DIVERTING MOST OF
&quot;PARENTAL BONUS&quot; TO RETIREMENT SAVINGS</H3>
<P>
 <B>CHICAGO</B> (August 23) - After decades of paying for their
children's food, clothing, education, sports equipment, dance
lessons and orthodontia, a vast majority of &quot;empty nesters&quot;
enjoyed a significant monetary boost after their children left
home, yet few are diverting most of this &quot;parental bonus&quot;
to their own retirement savings, according to the recent survey
<I><B>Kemper Funds/Age Wave Lifestage Monitor: A National Survey
of Empty Nest Couples.</B></I>
<P>
 The Kemper Funds/Age Wave Lifestage Monitor in March polled by
mail 1,007 married Americans between the ages of 40 and 59, with
incomes of more than $50,000 and whose children had left home
and become financially independent within the past four years.
<P>
 &quot;For many years, Americans have been telling us that they've
had to sacrifice their own retirement savings needs in part to
meet the financial needs of their children,&quot; said William
E. Chapman II, president of Kemper Retirement Plans Group. &quot;So
it's somewhat surprising that once that hurdle is removed, few were willing
to divert the lion's share of that income boost into retirement
savings -- despite the fact that most expressed concern about the amount of money they had saved for retirement so far.&quot;
<P>
  A vast majority (84.5%) of empty nesters surveyed reported that
they received a parental bonus - a boost in income - once their
children left home, finished school and became financially independent.
Of those, two-thirds (66.8%) reported having a boost of income
of $5,000 or more a year; approximately one-third (34.6%) reported
having a boost of more than $10,000 a year; a little less than
one third (29.6%) reported a boost of $1,000 to $4,999, while
3.2% reported having a $1,000 or less annual boost.
<P>
 Even though well over half of those surveyed (60.4%) said they
had not saved enough for retirement, few seem willing to use the
&quot;found&quot; money that came as a result of their children
becoming financially independent for that purpose. Only 40.7%
of those surveyed said that they were spending &quot;all&quot;
or &quot;most&quot; of the parental bonus on retirement. A little
more than half (55.7%) were earmarking only &quot;some&quot; for
retirement savings, and 3.6% were using &quot;none&quot; for retirement.
<P>
 &quot;Our survey uncovered that the parental bonus amounts to
anywhere from a 10% to 20% boost annually,&quot; Chapman pointed
out. &quot;If you pause a moment to think about it, that amount
significantly exceeds projected wage increases expected this year.
What's more, the wage and salary increases are an even smaller
percentage once you take into account taxes. Empty nesters may
be missing a golden opportunity to make up for lost time if they're
not directing this parental bonus to their retirement savings.&quot;
<P>
 Chapman advises that when children leave home, it's a good time
for parents to reassess their financial goals, savings and investment
plans. &quot;Most Americans understand that a change in lifestyle
-- be it getting married, changing jobs, buying a home, or retiring
- requires that they re-examine and modify their financial goals
and objectives. Like those lifestages, having your children leave
home is a critical time for this reassessment.&quot;
<P>
 A significant portion of the parental bonus is being diverted
to debt payments and travel. About one in five (18.4%) of those
surveyed who reported a boost in income when their children left
home said they were spending &quot;all&quot; or &quot;most&quot;
of the parental bonus paying off debts, and 11.7% were spending
&quot;all&quot; or &quot;most&quot; on traveling.
<P>
 Of those who reported some excess income after their children
left, the following number of respondents spent at least &quot;some&quot;
of the parental bonus on:
<UL>
<LI TYPE=CIRCLE>entertainment/dining (100%)
<LI TYPE=CIRCLE>charitable giving (87.5%)
<LI TYPE=CIRCLE>traveling (81.4%)
<LI TYPE=CIRCLE>&quot;buying things we couldn't afford before&quot; (74.7%)
<LI TYPE=CIRCLE>hobbies (70.4%)
<LI TYPE=CIRCLE>helping children with expenses (69.5%)
<LI TYPE=CIRCLE>remodeling their home (62.9%)
<LI TYPE=CIRCLE>grandchildren (58.8%)
<LI TYPE=CIRCLE>retirement savings (55.7%)
<LI TYPE=CIRCLE>paying off debts (49.3%)
</UL>

<P>
<B>Home, sweet home</B>
<P>
 Few empty nesters are willing to trade in their home for a smaller
version after their children left home. Only 11.8% of respondents
reported moving to a smaller home. Of those who did move, only
14.4% said they did so because they wanted more money to invest;
38.1% said they moved because they didn't need the space of their
former residence.
<P>
<B>Empty nesters welcome boomerang children, but aren't yet
sandwiched</B>
<P>
 &quot;One explanation as to why empty nesters are reluctant to
move to a smaller home is that they may not be convinced that
those kids are gone for good,&quot; Chapman noted. 
<P>
 In fact, one third (33.7%) of empty nesters surveyed have experienced
boomerang children - who leave their parents' home for a brief
period, but return at some point thereafter. And as mentioned
earlier, about three-quarters of the respondents said they were
using some of the parental bonus &quot;to help their children
out&quot; after they had flown the coop. 
<P>
 But contrary to the predictions of some demographers, most empty
nesters haven't yet felt the crunch of the &quot;sandwich,&quot;
in which they are simultaneously responsible for the well-being
of both their children and their parents or other elderly relatives.
Less than one-quarter (22.2%) reported that they were caregivers
for elderly relatives. Of those who are caregivers, very few (13.4%)
are financially responsible for those elderly relatives. Interestingly,
roughly two-thirds (63.4%) of respondents who said they were caregivers
also reported that they managed their elderly relatives' financial
affairs.<P>
<P>

<B>Lots of toys for tots, less money for ABCs</B>
<P>
 Among those empty nesters surveyed, 59.6% reported having grandchildren.
Of those with grandchildren, 20.8% reported spending more than
$1,000 on annual savings for their grandchildren's education or
investments. More than double that amount (45.1%) spent $1,000
per year on toys, clothes and entertainment for their grandkids.
<P>
 &quot;Grandparents often are more motivated by their grandchildren's
gratitude to indulge their most immediate needs and desires, rather
than to provide for their grandchildren's future financial needs,&quot;
Chapman said.

KEMPER MONEY FUNDS BUILD A SOUTH PACIFIC HIDE-AWAY
 ON THE WORLD WIDE WEB</H3>
<P>
<B>CHICAGO</B> (August 19) -- Have a question about money market funds?
 If you do, it's time to pay a visit to a mysterious millionaire
located at <A HREF="http://www.kempercash.com">kempercash.com.</A>  This experienced investor, based on
a private island in the South Pacific, guides visitors through
the essentials of money market funds.
<P>
 &quot;While islands in the South Pacific usually don't come to
mind when you think about money funds, we thought this would be
an unusual 'location' for our new web site,&quot; said Mike Harrington,
the Kemper Funds Group senior vice president for money fund marketing.
 &quot;Our goal was to create a relaxed site on an essential,
yet overlooked, investment.&quot;
<P>
 Harrington added that while several large fund families, including
Kemper Funds, have web sites featuring their entire investment
line-up, this is the first site that just focuses on a particular
fund category.
<P>
Drawing on his years of investment experience, the site's host
provides comprehensive information on how to select a money fund.
 His &quot;Financial Jargon to Plain English Dictionary,&quot;
which defines relevant terms such as commercial paper and repurchase
agreements, is designed to, &quot;...help make you fluent when
talking about money fund investments.&quot;  Current 7-day yields
and competitive rankings for Kemper Money Market Fund, Kemper
Government Money Fund and Kemper Tax-Free Money Fund are available.
 The site also allows visitors to try two different investment
scenarios with Kemper Money Market Fund.
<P>
 Harrington stated that the site will be expanded to offer new
features and to reflect visitor feedback.  The site just established
reciprocal links with the IBC/Financial Data web site and will
soon add the Kemper Money Funds prospectus and an application.
 <P>
 The <A HREF="../../prospectus.html">prospectus</A> for the Kemper Money Funds containing more complete
information, including management fees and expenses, is available
by calling 800/537-6001.  Investors should read it carefully before investing
or sending money.  Money funds seek to maintain a net asset value
of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that they will.
 Fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. government.
<P>
<A HREF="../../about/aboutzki.html">Zurich Kemper Investments, Inc.</A> (ZKI), formerly Kemper Financial
Services, Inc., is one of the largest investment managers headquartered

<H3>PATRICK ADAMS NAMED PORTFOLIO MANAGER OF KEMPER FUNDS FLAGSHIP GROWTH EQUITY FUND</H3>

<P>
 <B>CHICAGO</B> (June 3) -- In a move designed to further strengthen
its position as a leading equity mutual fund manager, Kemper Funds
management today announced that Patrick S. Adams, 35, has been
named portfolio manager of the $2.6 billion <A HREF="../../funds/growth.html">Kemper Growth Fund</A>,
the company's flagship growth equity mutual fund.  Adams replaces
chief investment officer for equities, Steven H. Reynolds, who
has been the Fund's interim manager since September 1995.  Adams
will report directly to Reynolds.
<P>
 &quot;We are thrilled to have a person of Pat's caliber at the
helm of our flagship growth equity fund,&quot; said Reynolds.
 &quot;His experience as a growth manager and his impressive record
will not only benefit our current Kemper Growth Fund shareholders,
but will enhance our ability to provide consistent, quality, growth-style
investment management expertise.&quot;
<P>
 Adams joins Kemper from Founders Asset Management in Denver,
Colo., where he managed the $400 million Founders Blue Chip Fund
and the $160 million Founders Balanced Fund.  Previously, he was
director of research and senior portfolio manager at
First Of America Investment Corporation, the investment manager
for the Parkstone Group of Funds.  From 1990 to 1992, he managed
the Parkstone Equity Fund, a $600 million growth fund.
<P>
 The addition of Adams to Kemper Funds' equity investment team
is the latest action by Zurich Kemper Investments, Inc. (ZKI),
the investment adviser to the Kemper Funds, in its plan to further
strengthen its  equity investment capabilities.  In August 1995,
a company subsidiary acquired substantially all of the assets
of Dreman Value Management, L.P., enabling the company to provide
retail and institutional clients with an enhanced product offering
that includes the value style of equity investing.  As part of
the acquisition, Kemper assumed management responsibility for
the <A  HREF="../../funds/high_return.html">Kemper-Dreman High Return Fund</A>,
<A  HREF="../../funds/contrarian.html">Kemper-Dreman Contrarian Fund</A>
and <A  HREF="../../funds/smallcap.html">Kemper-Dreman Small Cap Value Fund</A>. 
Shortly after the Dreman acquisition, Kemper hired veteran portfolio manager Steven Reynolds
from Alliance Capital Management to oversee and direct the company's
equity investment department.
<P>
 In addition to assuming responsibility for the Kemper-Dreman
Funds, the company has also expanded its equity product offering
considerably since August of 1995 by introducing three new funds:
<A  HREF="../../funds/valuegrowth.html">Kemper Value+Growth Fund</A>,
<A  HREF="../../funds/horiz20.html">Kemper Horizon Fund</A> and
<A  HREF="../../funds/europe.html">Kemper Europe Fund</A>.

<P>
 &quot;These bold actions on the equity side of our investment
management business support our company's strategic plan for growth
and success, and we will continue to aggressively implement our
expansion plan to help ensure our position as one of the leading
equity mutual fund managers in the industry,&quot; said Stephen
B. Timbers, chief executive officer and chief investment officer
at ZKI.
<P>
 Zurich Kemper Investments, Inc., formerly known as Kemper Financial
Services, Inc., is one of the largest investment managers headquartered
in North America.  Together with its affiliates, ZKI has more
than $79 billion in assets under management.  The company operates
with three strategic business units: retail mutual funds, retirement
plans and institutional asset management.  ZKI is the investment
adviser to the Kemper Funds and is part of Zurich Insurance Group,
a global organization headquartered in Zurich, Switzerland, that
provides services in life and non-life insurance, reinsurance
and asset management in more than 45 countries worldwide.

<H3>KEMPER FUNDS MARKS 20TH ANNIVERSARY OF NATION'S FIRST RETAIL MUNICIPAL
BOND FUND</H3>

<B>CHICAGO</B> (April 23) -- Twenty years ago this month Kemper Financial Services launched 
the <A HREF="../../funds/muni_bond.html">Kemper Municipal Bond Fund</A>, the nation's first municipal 
bond fund designed for individual investors.  The municipal bond mutual fund management was 
pioneered largely through the efforts and vision of the fund's first manager, the late Robert J. Butler.
<P>

"Bob Butler was noted for his work in developing new investment products, 
including the Kemper Municipal Bond Fund.  The introduction of a municipal bond fund 
tailored for individual investors represented a major innovation in tax-free investing and 
underscored Kemper's reputation as an innovator in the mutual fund arena," said Chris 
Mier, senior vice president and portfolio manager for all of Kemper's tax-free income funds. 
"The Kemper Municipal Bond Fund paved the way for wider participation in the tax-exempt 
market by individuals with small sums to invest."
<P>

From its inception date on April 20, 1976, the Kemper Municipal Bond Fund has had 
only three portfolio managers -- Robert Butler (1976 - 1985), J. Patrick Beimford (1985 - 
1992) and Chris Mier (1989 - present).  Kemper manages 10 
<A HREF="../../funds/taxfree.html">tax-free income funds</A>, including an intermediate-term fund and 
eight single state funds, representing assets of more than $5 billion.
<BR>
<P>
<B>The Municipal Bond Market: Then and Now</B>
<P>

Chris Mier, a 20-year veteran of the municipal bond market, points out a number of 
significant changes in the municipal bond industry during the past two decades.
<P>

"While the municipal bond market has grown in size and sophistication, it is still a 
diffuse, over-the-counter market with no central trading arena.  What has changed are the 
make-up of the market, the players, the technology and the sophistication of portfolio 
management practices."  In particular, Mier cites:
<UL>
<LI>Market participants:  "Twenty years ago, most muni bond investors typically were banks, 
bank trust departments and property-casualty insurers.  Today, individual investors 
account for approximately two-thirds of muni bond holdings acting through mutual 
funds, trust departments and on their own behalf."
</LI><P>
<LI>Credit quality:  "Increasingly, insurance has become a major feature of the municipal 
marketplace.  In 1976, insurance on municipal bonds didn't exist.  In 1995, more than 
43 percent of new issuance came to the market insured."
</LI><P>
<LI>Market composition:  "In 1976, tax-free investing was fairly simple.  Plain vanilla general 
obligation bonds comprised roughly half of the municipal market.  Changes in tax laws 
at the federal and state levels altered the ways in which municipalities and states finance 
their capital needs.  At present, revenue bonds make up 62 percent of the muni bond 
market, and general obligation bonds now make up less than 38 percent."
</LI><P>
<LI>Technological advancements:  "Price information is more readily available today, 
resulting in narrower bid-ask spreads and a more efficient market.  Additionally, more 
professional investors are employing sophisticated analytical tools.  Today, fund 
managers are focused on complex strategies involving management of duration, 
convexity and option-adjusted spreads in the marketplace.  In the past, portfolio 
managers used a 'basis book' to calculate yields.  Now they use desktop computer 
systems to compute duration and other financial information."
</LI>
</UL>

<B>The Future</B>
<P>
Over the next several years, Mier sees a continuation of some of the trends that have 
helped shape the municipal bond market over the previous 20 years.
<P>

"Portfolio managers will make greater use of technology in order to employ more 
sophisticated trading techniques as well as sophisticated risk management and 
performance attribution tools," said Mier.

<H3>ZURICH KEMPER INVESTMENTS LAUNCHES
NEW RETIREMENT PLANS UNIT</H3>

<B>CHICAGO</B> (April 2) -- As part of a strategic plan to further 
strengthen its position as a leading provider of qualified retirement 
plan products and services, Zurich Kemper Investments, Inc. 
(formerly Kemper Financial Services, Inc.) has formed a new strategic 
business unit, Kemper Retirement Plans Group.
<P>

"The formation of a separate, stand alone business unit to support and 
service qualified plans underscores our commitment to this increasingly 
important marketplace," said Stephen B. Timbers, president, chief 
executive officer and chief investment officer of Zurich Kemper 
Investments, Inc.
<P>

Separately, the company announced that William E. Chapman II has been 
named president of the Kemper Retirement Plans unit.  Chapman was formerly 
executive vice president of marketing and product management for Kemper.  
He has more than 30 years experience in the retirement plans business.
<P>

"Bill Chapman is a seasoned veteran and an accomplished executive with a 
tremendous wealth of knowledge and expertise in the qualified plans arena," 
said Timbers.  "Under his capable direction, we are confident that our 
retirement plan business will grow significantly and that in a few short 
years Kemper will be recognized as one of the leading providers of 
retirement plan products and services to businesses of all sizes."
<P>

"Our vision is clear: by the year 2000, we expect to be the acknowledged 
leader in the retirement plan business in a much broader sense than we are 
today," said Chapman.  "One of our first priorities is to increase our 
sales capability to support the broker-sold market and at the same time, 
hire salespeople to directly market to larger plan sponsors."
<P>

Chapman cited several other factors that he believes will drive Kemper's 
success in the coming years.  These factors include superior recordkeeping; 
innovative and broad use of technology to service the needs of 
participants, plan sponsors and administrators; and investment products 
that "make sense" to plan participants and address their investment needs 
and expectations.
<P>

With more than 45 years of professional investment management experience, 
Kemper has long been a household name for investment products and services. 
 Kemper is an experienced qualified plan provider who currently serves more 
than 8,000 plans and manages more than $4 billion in retirement plan 
assets.  The company believes it was the first to dispatch a field sales 
force committed exclusively to supporting qualified plan sales, and also 
the first to establish a fully dedicated in-house retirement plan marketing 
staff to market the company's retirement plans.
<P>

Kemper Retirement Plans is a unit of Zurich Kemper Investments, Inc. (ZKI). 
 ZKI is the investment manager for the <A HREF="../../funds/kemperfunds.html">Kemper Funds</A>.  
Kemper Funds consists of 61 open-end portfolios and seven closed-end portfolios.  It has nearly 3 
million shareholder accounts and approximately $45 billion in retail assets.
<P>

<A HREF="../../prospectus.html">Prospectuses</A> for the Kemper Funds are available from the 
principal underwriter, Kemper Distributors, Inc.  They contain more complete information including fees 
and expenses and should be read carefully before investing or sending money.
<P>
	
ZKI is part of Zurich Insurance Group, a global organization headquartered 
in Zurich, Switzerland that provides services in life and non-life 
insurance, reinsurance and asset management in more than 45 countries.

<H3>KEMPER FUNDS FORMS NEW DISTRIBUTION UNIT FOR FEE-BASED ADVISERS AND MUTUAL FUND WRAP PROGRAMS</H3>

of a new distribution unit to focus on the growing fee-based adviser and mutual fund wrap 
marketplace.

of distribution, we recognize the increasingly important role of registered investment 
advisers and fee-based programs," said Jim Greenawalt, executive vice president, director of 
sales for Kemper Distributors, Inc., the principal underwriter and distributor for the 
Kemper Funds.  "We have always believed in and have stressed the importance of investors 
working with professional financial advisers when it comes to making their investment 
decisions.  And, as long as a customer is working directly with a financial adviser, we will be 
flexible with our pricing structure."
<P>

Kemper has hired John A. Norris as a first vice president to head up the new 
registered investment adviser unit.  Norris was previously a senior vice president at Cozad 
Asset Management, Inc.  He will seek to form strategic alliances with various fee-based 
mutual fund wrap programs.

"We expect to further strengthen our relationships with our key broker/dealer clients 
as they expand their fee-based activities," said Norris.

<H3>KEMPER ROLLS OUT EXECUTIVE PLUS - A RETIREMENT PLAN SOLUTION FOR KEY
EXECUTIVES</H3>

<B>CHICAGO</B> (November 28) - Kemper today announced the introduction of
Executive Plus, a new turnkey nonqualified deferred compensation program
for key executives that can offer a solution to the sometimes
restrictive requirements of qualified retirement plans.
<P>

"Executive Plus is a retirement option for 401(k) plan sponsors looking
to provide additional tax-deferred investing opportunities to key
executives," said Ed Miner, first vice president of Kemper's qualified
plans area. Last year's tax code changes lowered the maximum
compensation on which qualified plan benefits can be based to $150,000,
making it difficult for executives to accumulate desired retirement
assets in traditional qualified plans. Additionally, many sponsors have
had to further reduce executive 401(k) salary deferral levels below the
$9,240 limit in order to pass nondiscrimination tests.
<P>

"Under Executive Plus a participant may defer compensation on a pre-tax
basis until those dollars are needed for retirement. Contributions and
any investment earnings generally are not taxable to the participant
until they are received," Miner said. 
<P>

"In addition, the employer also may contribute to the nonqualified plan
on behalf of the participant. These contributions, as well as
compensation deferred by participants, are not tax-deductible until they
are paid to the participant, usually at retirement."
<P>

Some of the benefits of Executive Plus include:
<P>

<UL>
<LI>
A flexible plan agreement
<P>

<LI>
Safe harbor model rabbi trust
<P>

<LI>
Corporate trustee services through Trust Company of America, Inc. (Not
affiliated with Kemper. The trustee services will be provided through a
separate agreement with that company.)
<P>

<LI>
Convenient contribution submission options
<P>

<LI>

<BR>

Unlike qualified plans, nonqualified programs have no contribution
dollar limits or employee coverage, eligibility or participation
requirements. As a result, their sponsors avoid complex reporting and
compliance testing necessary for qualified plans. Generally, reporting
involves only a one-time filing with the Department of Labor. Plan
adoption is easier because a sponsor avoids many of the formal set-up
requirements of a qualified plan. 
<P>

Usually, nonqualified plans are sponsored by C corporations. Because the
owners of S corporations, partnerships and sole proprietorships are
taxed as pass-through entities, nonqualified deferred compensation plans
do not provide effective deferral of compensation for owners of these
entities.
<P>

Program costs vary by provider but typically involve fees for legal
counsel corporate trustee services and the plan's funding mechanism. For
more information about Executive Plus, employers should talk with their

<H3>KEMPER FINANCIAL COMPLETES ACQUISITION
OF DREMAN VALUE MANAGEMENT ASSETS; NAMES PRESIDENT &amp; CEO OF ACQUIRED
OPERATIONS</H3>


<B>CHICAGO</B> (August 24) - Kemper Financial Services, Inc. (KFS), a
subsidiary of Kemper Corporation (NYSE: KEM) and the investment advisor
to the Kemper Mutual Funds, today announced the completion of the
acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Dreman Value
Management, L.P. (DVM), including assignment of the Dreman mutual funds
advisory contracts. Specific terms of the transaction were not
disclosed.
<P>

Separately, the company announced that James R. Neel has been named
president and chief executive officer of Kemper Advisors, Inc., a
subsidiary of KFS and the investment advisor to the Kemper-Dreman funds.
<P>

The Dreman mutual funds will be renamed as follows: 
the <A HREF="../../funds/high_return.html"> Kemper-Dreman
High Return Fund</A>, the <A HREF="../../funds/smallcap.html">
 Kemper-Dreman Small Cap Value Fund</A>, the
<A HREF="../../funds/contrarian.html"> Kemper-Dreman Contrarian Fund</A> 
and the Kemper-Dreman Fixed Income Fund.
<P>

"The closing of this transaction is significant because it immediately
allows us to provide retail and institutional clients with an enhanced
product offering that includes the value style of equity investing,"
said Stephen B. Timbers, chairman and chief executive officer of KFS.
"Furthermore, the acquisition affords Kemper tremendous flexibility in
bringing new products to market."
<P>

As previously reported, the investment functions of KFS and the acquired
operation will remain separate. David Dreman will remain as chairman of
the acquired operation. "We are extremely pleased that David will
continue to play an integral role in the new company, including his
active participation in managing key retail and institutional
portfolios," said Timbers.
<P>

The acquired operation will continue to be based in New Jersey. "By
keeping the investment functions separate, we believe that the
operations will retain the integrity of their investment process and
discipline," said Timbers.
<P>

Neel most recently was an executive vice president and equity portfolio
manager for Kemper Financial's institutional accounts. Prior to that he
managed several of the Kemper retail mutual funds and served as chief
equity strategist. He has been with KFS for six years. Before joining
KFS, Neel was with Loomis Sayles &amp; Co. where he managed a variety of
investment portfolios.
<P>

"We are delighted to have a person of Jim's caliber in the role of
president and CEO," said Timbers. "He is a highly qualified and
recognized professional in the investment community. His experience
coupled with his knowledge of Kemper will benefit him significantly in
his new position."
<P>

KFS has approximately $43.7 billion in mutual fund assets under
management, including 30 open-end funds and seven closed-end funds, as
of July 31, 1995. KFS' domestic institutional subsidiary, Kemper Asset
Management Company, has approximately $5.3 billion under management, not
including assets managed for Kemper Corporation's affiliates and the
Kemper National Insurance Companies. The acquired operation currently
has approximately $1.5 billion of institutional assets under management.
<P>

Kemper Financial Services, Inc. is one of the nation's largest asset
managers with more than $63 billion under management. It is a subsidiary
of Kemper Corporation, a holding company with principal operations in
asset management and life insurance.

<H3>CHANGING DEFINITION OF RETIREMENT:
<BR>
MAJORITY OF AMERICANS EXPECT TO WORK DURING RETIREMENT,  ACCORDING TO
KEMPER-ROPER RETIREMENT MONITOR
</H3>

<B>CHICAGO</B> (June 15) - A majority of working Americans believe they will be
forced to continue to work during retirement in order to make ends meet
and maintain their desired standard of living, according to a poll
released today by Kemper and Roper-Starch Worldwide.
<P>

The "Kemper-Roper Retirement Monitor" polled 2,086 randomly selected
Americans about their attitudes and expectations regarding retirement.
The survey included representation from demographic age groups
including: 20-Somethings (aged 20-29), Baby Boomers (aged 30-49),
Pre-retirees (aged 50-64) and Retirees (aged 65 and older). The survey
has a margin of error of plus/minus two percent.
<P>

"For Americans under the age of 50, the word "retirement" has taken on
new meaning," said William E. Chapman II, executive vice president of
Kemper. "When America's younger generations hit retirement age, it won't
necessarily mean the end of their working years - especially if they
want to maintain a comfortable lifestyle. Their challenge is to plan
carefully in an environment that is much more dynamic than their parents
had to contend with."
<P>

<B>Wages to replace Social Security, savings shortfalls</B>
<P>

"The old yardsticks by which current retirees measure their success in
funding a comfortable retirement no longer apply to younger Americans,"
noted Chapman. "These younger generations will try to fill the gap left
by what they expect to be limited Social Security benefits, diminished
health-care support and the lack of their own savings with wages earned
during retirement," Chapman predicted, and pointed to a number of
findings to support that claim:
<P>

<LI TYPE=CIRCLE>
A vast majority of the two younger generations surveyed - 71% of Baby
Boomers and 81% of 20-Somethings - believe that Social Security will not
be there for them. 
<P>

<LI TYPE=CIRCLE>
Some 65% of Baby Boomers and 74% of 20-Somethings acknowledged that
they were not saving enough for retirement. Paying off a mortgage,
reducing credit card debt, and the costs of raising children are cited
as barriers to saving more.
<P>

<LI TYPE=CIRCLE>
Despite their pessimistic expectations about government benefits they
might receive in retirement and their inadequate level of savings, 61%
of 20-Somethings and 68% of Baby Boomers believe that they will have
enough to live comfortably during retirement. 
<P>

<LI TYPE=CIRCLE>
Nearly six out of 10 of working Americans surveyed believe that they
will need to work - at least part-time - during their retirement years.
Fortunately, perhaps, the same amount of respondents said they <B><I>want</I></B> &nbsp;to
continue working after retirement, regardless of their financial status.

<P>

<B>20-Somethings, Boomers and Pre-retirees seek more advice</B>
<P>

"Clearly, most Americans understand the importance of carefully planning
for retirement, so attitude is not the problem," Chapman said. "Rather,
changing political and economic conditions are causing uncertainty.
Despite the dearth of information available on retirement planning,
Americans are still clamoring for help." 
<P>

An overwhelming majority of 20-Somethings (69%), Baby Boomers (65%), and
Pre-Retirees (65%) said that their respective generations need more help
planning for retirement. Roughly one in three of 20-Somethings and Baby
Boomers and one in five Pre-Retirees feel "uncertain" or "at a total
loss" when it comes to planning for their own retirement.
<P>

When asked who they did or will turn to for advice on most of their
retirement planning, Americans cite a number of sources: a broker or
financial advisor (39%); spouse (37%); friends (24%); parents (23%);
other family members (15%); personal finance magazines (12%); research
publications (6%); and on-line financial services (3%).
<P>

Six out of 10 Americans felt they need a broker or financial advisor to
help them cut through the clutter and deal with all the information out
there about investments. Yet most weren't very confident in their
ability to chose a broker or financial advisor. More than half of the
20-Somethings and Baby Boomers feel either "uncertain" or "at a total
loss" when it comes to knowing how to select a broker or financial
advisor. 
<P>

<B>Among the survey's other key findings:</B>
<P>

<LI TYPE=CIRCLE>
When asked what one piece of advice they would give younger generations
about saving for retirement, retirees said "start saving early" (62%),
and "take advantage of company sponsored savings plans (18%). Few
mentioned "save more money" (8%). Not surprisingly, 47% of retirees said
they did not start saving early enough for retirement. 
<P>

<LI TYPE=CIRCLE>
Only one in four retirees said they were able to accurately predict
their financial needs before they retired. 
<P>

<LI TYPE=CIRCLE>
Americans across all groups named company sponsored plans - including
401(k)
<P>

<LI TYPE=CIRCLE>
(52%) and 403(b) (4%) plans - as their top retirement savings vehicle,
followed by savings accounts (44%), mutual funds (40%), life insurance
(39%) and IRA or Keogh accounts (39%). 
<P>

<LI TYPE=CIRCLE>
Roughly two out of three Americans say that they share the
decision-making about investing for retirement with their spouse.

<H3>"20-SOMETHINGS" NO SLACKERS WHEN IT COMES TO RETIREMENT PLANNING, 
ACCORDING TO KEMPER-ROPER RETIREMENT MONITOR</H3>

<B>CHICAGO</B> (June 15) - When it comes to retirement, Americans in their 20s
shatter the "slacker" myth of being lost and living for the now,
according to a poll released today by Kemper and Roper-Starch Worldwide.
<P>

The "Kemper-Roper Retirement Monitor" polled 2,086 randomly selected
Americans about their attitudes and expectations regarding retirement.
The survey included representation from demographic age groups
including: 20-Somethings (aged 20-29), Baby Boomers (aged 30-49),
Pre-retirees (aged 50-64) and Retirees (aged 65 and older). The survey
has a margin of error of plus/minus two percent.
<P>

"The so-called '20-Something' generation shows surprising sophistication
about issues pertaining to planning, saving, and investing for
retirement," said William E. Chapman II, executive vice president of
Kemper. "They are cognizant of their responsibility to plan, are willing
to hold off on personal consumption in order to save for retirement, and
have thought seriously about their future and their retirement."
<P>

<B>Among the survey's key findings:</B>
<P>

<LI TYPE=CIRCLE>
Half (50%) of 20-Somethings said they had started putting money away for
retirement within the last one to five years. In contrast, 40% of Baby
Boomers aged 40 to 44, and 35% of Boomers aged 45 to 49, waited until at
least their 30s to start saving for retirement.
<P>

<LI TYPE=CIRCLE>
61% of Americans in their 20s said they or their spouse had put money
aside for retirement in either savings or investments, while 71% of Baby
Boomers said the same.
<P>

<LI TYPE=CIRCLE>
58% of 20-Somethings said they or their spouse had put money into a
401(K), somewhat more than 52% of the Baby Boomers who indicated that
they had done so.
<P>

<LI TYPE=CIRCLE>
Roughly three out of four 20-Somethings said that retirement is a
priority in their savings plan; 20-Somethings are as likely as Baby
Boomers to say that retirement is something they think a great deal
about. 
<P>

<LI TYPE=CIRCLE>
20-Somethings (55%) were as likely as Baby Boomers (53%) to say they are
prepared to reduce personal spending now in order to save for
retirement.
<P>

<LI TYPE=CIRCLE>
About one in four 20-Somethings reported that they had increased the
amount of money they put into retirement savings during the past year;
39% of Baby Boomers reported doing the same.

<H3>FIVE THINGS INVESTORS SHOULD KNOW BEFORE
CHOOSING A MONEY MARKET FUND</H3>

<B>CHICAGO</B> (May 31) - Kemper Financial Services, Inc. (KFS), the investment
adviser to Kemper Money Market Fund, today announced it is offering a
free brochure to help savers and investors make wise decisions when
selecting a money market fund. Titled <EM><STRONG>Shopping Around for a Money Market
Fund? Five Things You Should Know Before You Invest</EM></STRONG>, 
the brochure can be obtained by calling 1-800-694-1080, 
ext. 501.
<P>

The brochure identifies five important considerations in choosing a
money market fund and offers guidelines for understanding each
consideration.
<P>

"Money market funds are an essential building block for any sound
financial plan. They are designed to deliver money market yields and to
maintain stability of principal," said Michele Rudin, director of retail
money fund marketing at KFS. "Yet, some money market funds have turned
to risky strategies to deliver higher yields. Helping to educate
investors on how to make sound investment decisions is one of our
primary goals."
<P>

According to the money fund specialists at Kemper, whether a person is a
conservative saver or a savvy investor, there are a few things he or she
should know before choosing a money market fund, including:
<P>

<UL>
<LI>
consider your tax bracket and the benefits of taxable versus tax-
exempt income
<P>

<LI>
look for consistent performance over time, not just today's hottest
yields
<P>

<LI>
check out the fund's expenses and how big a bite they will take out 
of your return
<P>

<LI>
think about the account services you will use and find out if they 
will cost you extra
<P>

<LI>
take a look at the fund's sponsor and track record
</UL>

<BR>

Kemper Money Market Fund, one of the largest and oldest U.S. money
funds, has assets of more than $5 billion. An investment in Kemper Money
Market Fund is neither insured nor guaranteed by the U.S. Government.
The Fund does seek to maintain a stable $1.00 share value, though there
can be no assurance that it will be maintained.
<P>

Kemper Financial Services, Inc. (KFS), is one of the nation's largest
money managers with over 45 years of experience and, together with its
affiliates, has approximately $60 billion in assets under management.
KFS is a subsidiary of Kemper Corporation (NYSE: KEM), a holding company

Kemper Financial Services, Inc. (KFS) was formed in 1948 when five Chicago 
entrepreneurs formed a mutual fund to capitalize on a technological breakthrough called 
television. They started Television Shares Management Corporation, and their Television 
Fund was the first to focus on the success and technological advances related to the 
television industry. Through successful innovation and diversification, KFS has enjoyed 
more than four decades of growth and prosperity. From its predecessor company 
managing a single mutual fund in 1948, KFS has grown to manage more than 28 different 
open-end mutual fund offerings as well as several closed-end funds. With more than $63 
billion in assets under management, KFS is one of the nation's largest asset management

<IMG SRC="gifs/totalreturn_head.gif" ALT="How To Arrive At Total Return"><BR>

A recent <I>Kemper Reports</I>&#160; survey found that most shareholders responding to a recent Kemper Pulse survey evaluate the performance of their mutual fund on the basis of total return (for more survey results, see <A HREF="evaluate_perform.html">How Kemper Shareholders Evaluate Performance</A>). That's good because total return represents the net effect of everything that happened with your fund over a certain time period (see below for a complete description of total return). 
<P>

To fully understand your fund's performance, it can be helpful to review the components of total return. A fund's total return in one year cannot be used to predict its performance in the next. By considering where your fund's return came from, however, you may have a better idea of what will influence your fund's ability to perform in the future.
<P>

Let's review the components of total return for three basic fund types.
<P>


<IMG SRC="gifs/totalreturn_subhead1.gif" ALT="Money market funds"><BR>

A money market fund's total return will be generated by income earned on its net investments, which is paid to shareholders in the form of income dividends. Short-term capital gains and unrealized appreciation, while possible, are uncommon.
<P>

<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="gifs/totalreturn_image1.gif" ALT="Money market funds total return">
</CENTER><P>

Because a money market fund must continually reinvest as its existing short-term securities mature - requiring the proceeds to be reinvested at prevailing rates - the money market fund is especially sensitive to changes in rates. Its earning ability is directly dependent upon short-term interest rates, and its income distributions will fluctuate.
<P>

At the same time, however, the fund manager strives to avoid NAV fluctuation. A money market fund seeks to maintain a stable net asset value $1.00 per share (although there can be no assurance that it will).
<P>


<IMG SRC="gifs/totalreturn_subhead2.gif" ALT="Income funds"><BR>

There are many types of income funds, and each type has its own investment strategy. But every income fund shares one objective: the generation of current income.
<P>

<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="gifs/totalreturn_image2.gif" ALT="Income funds total return">
</CENTER>
<P>

These are just a few of the considerations that can affect a fund's ability to earn income:<BR>

<UL>
<LI>The type of income-producing security that the fund invests in - e.g., because of the greater risk to principal, corporate bonds and mortgages (and mortgage-related securities) will generally yield more than comparable maturity U.S. Treasuries.
<LI>The length of the fund's investment - funds that are willing to take the risk of investing in securities for a longer period of time will generally be compensated (with a higher rate of return) for assuming such risk.
<LI>The quality of the investment - in order to appeal to investors, a poorer quality investment generally needs to offer a higher rate of return.
</UL>
<P>

Each of these considerations represents a risk - and that risk can be reflected in fluctuations in the price of a fund's shares.
<P>

Lower-risk income funds - specifically funds whose objective is to maintain preservation of principal - will attempt to provide relative NAV stability. As with other income funds, these funds' ability to generate income depends upon interest rates and the maturities of their securities. However, the range of NAV change - up or down - may not be as great as other funds.
<P>

High-risk income are willing to take maximum risk to maximize current income. Such a strategy, however, can erode principal. In that case, a positive total return may be the result of strong income dividends offsetting a shrinking net asset value.
<P>



<IMG SRC="gifs/totalreturn_subhead3.gif" ALT="Capital growth funds"><BR>

Capital growth funds, whose potential for total return is the highest among all mutual fund types over time, generally produce their total return from a combination of capital gain, income and price appreciation. Both the dividends and net asset value of your capital growth fund will fluctuate.
<P>

<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="gifs/totalreturn_image3.gif" ALT="Capital growth funds total return">
</CENTER>
<P>

The level of dividend income earned from stocks owned by the portfolio will fluctuate. Income dividends vary according to many factors, including the number of dividend-paying stocks in a portfolio and the level of dividends paid.
<P>

No year is the same as the next when it comes to capital gain dividends. The strength of the stock market in 1995, for example, prompted several fund managers to take profits on many holdings, which generated significant capital gains.
<P>

It is possible for a fund to produce a solid total return without paying significant dividends. In order to do this, the value of the portfolio must appreciate.
<P>

Within the broad category of capital growth funds are funds that combine capital growth and income. Capital growth and income funds offer the added potential of earning income from fixed-income securities owned by the portfolio. By investing in bonds or other securities that produce income, this fund type helps reduce its reliance on capital growth - and its risk level. Of course, this strategy of attempting to reduce risk is not without a cost: The prospect of building total return through price appreciation is diminished for this type of fund.
<P>

Let's face it, if there were a place where we could all earn a solid return on our investments with little or no risk, you probably wouldn't be reading this. But, very often, you may have to accept more risk to seek higher potential returns than those offered by guaranteed or insured investments.

Scott Jordan is 50 years old. Through hard work and determination, Scott has managed to save $100,000 over the years. Scott wants to retire at age 60, but feels that he needs to earn more on his investments than he is presently earning in order to retire in comfort.
<P>
His financial advisor has suggested that he put his money in several investments, each with varying degrees of risk, in order to make his retirement nest egg potentially grow faster.
<P>
Scott asks just one question:<BR>
<B>"What if I lose money?"</B>


<P>

To help reassure Scott, his financial advisor illustrates this scenario: a hypothetical total loss of one investment.


<P>
Let's see what happened to Scott's hypothetical investment in this example.

By spreading your investment over several choices, you may be able to participate in the return potential of the stock market and reduce your risk.

<BR>
In our example, Scott's historical hypothetical investments included investments in stocks and bonds, represented by indices. Another popular way to diversify is to invest in a mutual fund, which spreads its portfolio holdings across a number of stocks and/or bonds.
<P>
Not only does this further spread the risk of investing in the stock or bond markets, it allows your money to be managed by professional portfolio managers, trained to recognize both opportunities and risks.

<IMG BORDER=0 SRC="gifs/diversification_subhd6.gif" ALT="The Value Of Professional Management"><BR>
Professional management can add a great deal of value to the concept of diversification. Mutual fund shareholders benefit from the years of experience each portfolio management team brings to the table.
<P>
Ask your financial representative to review your investments in light of your financial goals and your tolerance for risk.

There are important differences among these investments that should be considered in reviewing this data.  Rates of Treasury obligations are fixed at issuance and timely payment of principal and interest is backed by the U.S. Treasury.  Market value will fluctuate inversely with interest rates prior to maturity and will equal par at maturity.  Investment return and principal value of stocks will fluctuate with changes in the market.  The returns and net asset value of mutual funds will fluctuate and shares upon redemption will be worth more or less than original cost.

<IMG BORDER=0 SRC="gifs/mistakes_head.gif" ALT="The 13 Most Common Mistakes To Avoid When Investing In Mutual Funds">
<P>

<IMG BORDER=0 SRC="gifs/mistakes_growthchart.gif" ALT="Amazing Growth in the Number of Mutual Funds: 1985-1995" ALIGN=RIGHT>
How fast is the mutual fund industry growing? Today, 31% of all American households own shares of at least one mutual fund. Between 1990 and year-end 1995, assets in mutual funds skyrocketed from $567 billion to $2.1 trillion. And, as the chart at right indicates, the number of mutual funds available has also soared, from 1,500 in 1985 to more than 5,700 today. Clearly, American investors are aware of the advantages of mutual funds. Now, we'd like to take that awareness one step further.
<P>
The following are 13 of the most common and costly mistakes to avoid when investing in mutual funds. After all, one of the surest routes to <I>smart</I>&#160; investing is <I>educated</I>&#160; investing.
<BR CLEAR=RIGHT>

<P>


<B><FONT SIZE=+1 COLOR="003300">Common Mistake #1</FONT></B><BR>
<FONT COLOR="#660000"><B>Choosing a fund with short-term objectives to address long-term financial goals.</B></FONT>
<P>
If you are investing for your preschooler's college education or a dream retirement home, then a long-term investment perspective is probably more appropriate than a short-term one. Generally speaking, the more long-term your perspective, the greater your tolerance of price fluctuations should be. After all, if you are giving an investment 20 or 25 years to grow, you can probably withstand the price fluctuations that have historically accompanied greater rewards.
<P>
In short, don't overlook the dual use of many mutual fund investments -- meeting monthly income needs while also taking advantage of long-term growth potential.

<P>

<B><FONT SIZE=+1 COLOR="003300">Common Mistake #2</FONT></B><BR>
<FONT COLOR="#660000"><B>Always choosing the fund that is advertising the highest yield, rather than looking at total return.</B></FONT>
<P>
Yield is one way of evaluating a fund's performance. A high yield, however, may come at the expense of the fund's net asset value, or share price. Some funds may reduce the underlying value to pay out that high current income. As a result, the market value of your investment may be diminished.
<P>
The most complete measure of mutual fund performance is <I><A HREF="../totalreturn.html">total return</A></I>.&#160; Total return takes into account the three components of performance: income dividends, capital gain dividends and changes in the value of your fund's shares. As a result, total return provides a more complete picture of performance than looking only at current income, or yield.

<P>

<B><FONT SIZE=+1 COLOR="003300">Common Mistake #3</FONT></B><BR>
<FONT COLOR="#660000"><B>Choosing a fund based on incomplete magazine or newspaper information.</B></FONT>
<P>
Some magazine and newspaper rankings are based on yield (current income) rather than on the total value of the investment. Also, look carefully at the reporting period for a fund's performance. Some funds have had high returns for a quarter or two, or maybe one year. If you are making a long-term investment, it's critical that you look at the performance of a fund over a longer period of time -- three, five, or even ten years. Of course, a fund's past performance cannot guarantee its future performance, but it can give you a good idea of a fund's history and whether it has performed consistently over the years.
<P>
Two of the best-known third-party ranking services are <A HREF="http://www.lipperweb.com/">Lipper Analytical Services, Inc.</A> and <A HREF="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/library/msmf.pl">Morningstar, Inc.</A> Both rank funds by total return over long periods of time.

<P>

<B><FONT SIZE=+1 COLOR="003300">Common Mistake #4</FONT></B><BR>
<FONT COLOR="#660000"><B>Investing in mutual funds that deduct sales charges from your reinvested dividends.</B></FONT>
<P>
<IMG BORDER=0 SRC="gifs/mistakes_chart4.gif" ALT="Missing Out on Additional Income Earned from Free Reinvestment of Dividends" ALIGN=RIGHT>
A sales charge compensates the individual who helps you select the right mutual fund. But, after you buy, why should you continue paying? Make sure the fund you select doesn't continue to deduct sales charges on your reinvested dividends. Over the life of your investment, free dividend reinvestment, with full compounding, can be a significant benefit. Kemper Funds offer free reinvestment of dividends at net asset value. That means you do not pay a sales charge for dividend reinvestment.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>
Note: The assumed 8% return in the chart is not indicative of past or future performance of any particular mutual fund. The yield and net asset value of a mutual fund will fluctuate. In the example, total income earned from free reinvestment of dividends compounded monthly over a 10-year period is $22,196.40. Total income earned from reinvestment of dividends with a 4% sales charge over a 10-year period is $21,501.83. So, the additional income earned from free reinvestment of dividends over a 10-year period is $694.57.
</FONT>
<BR CLEAR=RIGHT>

<P>

<B><FONT SIZE=+1 COLOR="003300">Common Mistake #5</FONT></B><BR>
<FONT COLOR="#660000"><B>Not investing in a municipal bond mutual fund when your objective is tax-free income.</B></FONT>
<P>
Given today's potentially higher marginal tax rates, more investors are turning to tax-free investments such as mutual funds that invest in municipal bonds. The income dividends from these funds are exempt from federal income taxes, though they may be subject to state or local taxes. And, if you invest in a state-specific fund, the income can be free from state and local taxes as well. For some investors, a portion of income may be subject to the alternative minimum tax.<SUP><A HREF="#1">1</A></SUP>

<P>

<B><FONT SIZE=+1 COLOR="003300">Common Mistake #6</FONT></B><BR>
<FONT COLOR="#660000"><B>Not having an Individual Retirement Account (IRA) if you are eligible to have one.</B></FONT>
<P>
Despite legislative changes over the years, the IRA continues to offer most investors tremendous opportunities to save and invest for retirement through the deferral of taxes. The powerful effect of tax-deferred compounding over time, and the affordability of the IRA, continue to make this an extremely important component of effective retirement planning.
<P>
Investing in more than one mutual fund IRA allows you to further reduce risk by diversifying. You should, of course, review the description of the investment objective and policies in the <A HREF="../../prospectus.html">prospectus</A> of a fund before investing to more fully understand the market and credit risk associated with an investment in a particular fund.<SUP><A HREF="#1">1</A></SUP>

<P>

<B><FONT SIZE=+1 COLOR="003300">Common Mistake #7</FONT></B><BR>
<FONT COLOR="#660000"><B>Choosing a fund without understanding all of the fees and expenses.</B></FONT>
<P>
Some investors shop by comparing only sales charges. But, in addition to sales charges, mutual fund shareowners indirectly pay for management fees, general expenses, and, in some cases, distribution and administrative fees.
<P>
Distribution and administrative fees are used by some funds toward payment of fund marketing and account-servicing. These fees are normally paid to third parties, like brokerage firms and banks, which market and service fund accounts. These charges are either in lieu of, or in addition to, sales charges paid by the investor. Management fees are paid by the fund to the fund's investment manager for expertise in the management of the fund's portfolio. These fees are usually a fixed percent per annum of the funds average net assets.
<P>
General expenses include other operational expenses that are charged directly to the fund and include transfer agent, custodial and legal fees. Before you invest, study all the fees. It's better to know up-front than to find out later that performance of your fund is being pulled down by high distribution and management fees, or uncontrolled fund expenses. And, be sure to read a fund's <A HREF="../../prospectus.html">prospectus</A> before you invest.

<P>

<B><FONT SIZE=+1 COLOR="003300">Common Mistake #8</FONT></B><BR>
<FONT COLOR="#660000"><B>Choosing a fund that doesn't have the shareholder privileges you might need or failing to activate those privileges when you open a fund account.</B></FONT>
<P>
To make the management of your account easier, most mutual funds offer investing privileges free of charge. Some funds, however, charge a fee for using them.
<P>
To avoid headaches and delays later on, be sure to activate your investing privileges -- especially exchange and wire-redemption privileges -- when you open a new account. These privileges include: <A HREF="../../shareholders/forms.html">reinvestment of dividends</A>, <A HREF="../../shareholders/forms.html">exchange privileges</A>, <A HREF="../../shareholders/forms.html">wire redemptions</A>, <A HREF="../../shareholders/forms.html">pre-authorized purchase plans</A> and <A HREF="../../shareholders/forms.html">systematic withdrawal plans</A>.
<P>
Whatever you decide, make sure that you choose a fund that offers the privileges you need - at no extra charge. These privileges are subject to modification, suspension, or termination by a fund. 

<P>

<B><FONT SIZE=+1 COLOR="003300">Common Mistake #9</FONT></B><BR>
<FONT COLOR="#660000"><B>Failing to reinvest all dividends in order to take advantage of the power of compounding.</B></FONT>
<P>
<IMG BORDER=0 SRC="gifs/mistakes_chart9.gif" ALT="Failing to Reinvest Dividends and Missing Out on the Power of Compounding" ALIGN=RIGHT>
Reinvesting your dividends can help add substantially to the growth of your investment. The chart to the right (for illustrative purposes only) portrays the beneficial impact of reinvestment income monthly at various interest rates, over a ten-year period. The chart assumes a $10,000 initial investment. The assumed rates are not representative of any yield or return that a particular fund may offer.
<BR CLEAR=RIGHT>

<P>

<B><FONT SIZE=+1 COLOR="003300">Common Mistake #10</FONT></B><BR>
<FONT COLOR="#660000"><B>Failing to get professional advice in selecting the mutual funds that are right for your unique financial situation.</B></FONT>
<P>
Today's marketplace offers more than 5,700 mutual funds with many different investment objectives. In each investment category alone, there can be hundreds of funds from which to choose. How do you decide which fund is best for your personal financial situation and goals?
<P>
The answer is simple: obtain the advice of a broker, banker or financial planner before you purchase. In today's ever-changing financial and tax environment, the need for professional guidance has never been greater. It's easy to consult a broker, banker or financial planner before you make a mutual fund choice.

<P>

<B><FONT SIZE=+1 COLOR="003300">Common Mistake #11</FONT></B><BR>
<FONT COLOR="#660000"><B>Choosing a fund that makes redeeming shares like pulling teeth.</B></FONT>
<P>
Make sure the fund you select has simple and convenient redemption procedures. At most fund companies, the quickest and most convenient way is to have redemption proceeds wired to your local bank account. Kemper's wire-redemption privilege, if pre-authorized, makes it possible for you to redeem $1,000 or more with one toll-free phone call. Your money is normally sent via FedWire&#174; to your designated bank account the next business day, free of charge by the fund.
<P>
Even if you did not choose wire-redemption privileges, you may still redeem up to $50,000* without obtaining a signature guarantee. To redeem $50,000 or less, just call your financial representative. Or, you can send a letter requesting the amount you desire, signed by the owner(s) of the account. A check payable to you will be sent to your address of record within seven days. There is no need to make an extra trip to your bank or broker to get your signature guaranteed.
<P>
*Redemption requests by individuals and certain designated institutional account holders for over $50,000, and all requests by institutions not so designated, do require a signature guarantee. See the <A HREF="../../prospectus.html">prospectus</A> for details and limitations.

<P>

<B><FONT SIZE=+1 COLOR="003300">Common Mistake #12</FONT></B><BR>
<FONT COLOR="#660000"><B>Choosing a fund that is not a member of a family of mutual funds.</B></FONT>
<P>
Financial markets are constantly changing in response to economic and environmental factors. As a result, the mutual fund you select today may not be right tomorrow. You need the advantage of being able to conveniently exchange into another fund with different investment objectives. So you should select a fund that is part of a family of funds.
<P>
Kemper Funds include a wide range of mutual funds to address a lifetime of changing investment objectives. Should your investment needs or market conditions change, you can move your investment within the Fund Family with one toll-free call.* Your Shareholder Services representative will be happy to tell you more about the other Kemper Funds.
<P>
*The exchange privilege is subject to modification, suspension and termination and to certain limitations described in the <A HREF="../../prospectus.html">prospectus</A>.

<P>

<B><FONT SIZE=+1 COLOR="003300">Common Mistake #13</FONT></B><BR>
<FONT COLOR="#660000"><B>Choosing a fund that is administered and managed by a firm that is here today, but may be gone tomorrow.</B></FONT>
<P>
When you invest your money in a mutual fund, you want to be sure it is being handled by an experienced, well capitalized firm with an established track record.
<P>

<IMG BORDER=0 SRC="gifs/dollarcost_head.gif" ALT="Dollar Cost Averaging">

<P>



<IMG BORDER=0 SRC="gifs/dollarcost_subhd1.gif" ALT="Now you don't have to try to predict when and how the markets will move."><BR>
<B>"Buy low, sell high."</B> So easy to say, but not so easy to do.  In reality, many investors find it tough to resist the natural temptation to pull out of the market when prices are falling, or to put more money in after a significant rally.
<P>
And many more investors, concerned that they have to get it <I>right</I>&#160; to hit it <I>big</I>, spend so long waiting for the "right time" to get into the market that they never do invest.  They let their fears about market fluctuations deny them the outstanding performance opportunities provided by stocks.


<P><BR>

<IMG BORDER=0 SRC="gifs/dollarcost_subhd2.gif" ALT="A strategy to make market fluctuation  work for you."><BR>
There is a way to help reduce the risk of investing at the wrong time and actually take advantage of the ups and downs of the stock market.  It's a simple strategy that proves timing isn't everything.  It's called <B>dollar cost averaging</B>.
<P>
While <B>dollar cost averaging</B> can help protect you from buying only at the absolute worst time, it cannot guarantee a profit or protect against a loss in a declining market.  But if you have the patience to ride out the tough times and stick to your regular investing schedule, there are definite advantages to dollar cost averaging.


<P><BR>


<IMG BORDER=0 SRC="gifs/dollarcost_subhd3.gif" ALT="Invest regular amounts at regular intervals - and stick to your plan."><BR>
With <B>dollar cost averaging</B>, you make smaller investments at regular intervals over a period of time, instead of a large, one-time investment.  The investment amount and frequency are up to you (for instance, $200 each week, $500 each month, or $1,000 every three months).
<P>
Successful <B>dollar cost averaging</B> requires that you stick to your plan, regardless of what the market does.  Make sure you select an amount that is consistent with your financial means, so that you can continue to purchase shares even through periods of low share prices.


<P><BR>


<IMG BORDER=0 SRC="gifs/dollarcost_subhd4.gif" ALT="How does dollar cost averaging work?"><BR>
It's simpler than you might expect.

<P>

<IMG BORDER=0 SRC="gifs/dollarcost_subhd5.gif" ALT="Pay a lower cost per share."><BR>
Since you invest the same dollar amount each period, you automatically purchase more shares when prices are low and fewer shares when prices are high.  This means that, over the entire purchase period, your average cost per share will be lower than the investment's average price per share.  And you have used market fluctuations to your investment advantage.


<P>


<IMG BORDER=0 SRC="gifs/dollarcost_subhd6.gif" ALT="Let's look at some hypothetical examples:"><BR>
You've decided to invest $5,000 in a stock mutual fund, in $1,000 monthly investments over a five-month period.  Let's see how three typical market trends-rising, declining, and fluctuating (up and down)-affect your total investment.
<P>
Note:  The hypothetical share prices used are for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to represent the actual prices of any Kemper Fund.


<P><BR>


<IMG BORDER=0 SRC="gifs/dollarcost_subhd7.gif" ALT="During a Rising Market"><BR>
In an up market, the best possible time to buy is obviously at the very beginning-the ground floor. But how can you tell exactly when the upswing will start? The truth is, no one can.
<P>
<CENTER>
<IMG BORDER=0 SRC="gifs/dollarcost_rising.gif">
</CENTER>
<P>
The beauty of <B>dollar cost averaging</B> is that you don't need a crystal ball to guide your investment plan.
<P>

<IMG SRC="gifs/taxable_head.gif" ALT="Taxable Or Tax-Exempt?">
<BR>

Depending on your tax bracket, you may be better off - and enjoy a yield
advantage - in an investment that is exempt from federal income taxes.
<BR><BR>

The primary intention of tax-exempt investments is to generate income
that is not subject to federal income taxes. (Income may be subject to
state and local taxes, and a portion of income may be subject to the
alternative minimum tax for certain investors.)
<BR><BR>

When you consider the federal taxes you would owe on the income you receive
from a taxable investment, you may find that you will retain more income
with a tax-exempt investment. In general, the higher your tax bracket,
the more advantageous a tax-exempt investment can be - as you will note in
the tables below. (Both tables are based on 1996 federal rates.)<BR>
<BR><BR>

<IMG SRC="gifs/taxable_chart2_head.gif"
ALT="If your adjusted gross income is more than $117,950*">
<BR>

<IMG SRC="gifs/taxable2_chart.gif">
<BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE=-1>*This table assumes a decrease of $3.75 of itemized deductions for each $100
of adjusted gross income over $117,950. For a married couple with adjusted
gross income between $176,950 and $299,450 (single between $117,950 and
$240,450), add 0.7% to the above marginal federal tax rate for each personal and dependency
exemption. The taxable equivalent yield is the tax-exempt yield divided
by 100% minus the adjusted tax rate. For example: if the table tax rate is
37.1% and you are married with no dependents, the adjusted tax rate is
38.5% (37.1% + 0.7%+0.7%). For a tax-exempt yield of 6%, the taxable
equivalent yield is about 9.76% (6% &#247; (100%-38.5%).
<BR><BR></FONT SIZE=-1>

As shown in the tables, you would have to earn significantly higher yields
on a
taxable investment to offset the effect of the federal tax you would owe
on
your income. You would not be liable to pay federal income tax on the
 interest dividend income
you receive from the tax-exempt investment. However, for all tax exempt 
mutual funds, distribution of capital gains are considered taxable
 income to the shareholder. Please remember that
a portion of the interest dividend may be considered a tax preference 
item for purposes of the alternative minimum tax. (Of course, the yields in
the
tables are for purposes of illustration only and do not reflect the
yield of
a specific investment.)
<BR><BR>

Even though most investors prefer to avoid taxes, the tax advantage and
lower tax-exempt yields available from tax-exempt investments are not
the
best choice for all investors. For your own circumstances, be sure to
work
through the calculations shown above or consult your financial
representative.
<BR><BR>

Investors are required to disclose on their federal income tax returns
the
amount of tax-exempt interest earned during the year. In addition,
individuals whose modified income, which includes adjusted gross income,
tax-exempt interest and 50 percent of their Social Security benefits,
exceeds a base amount will be subject to federal income tax on as much
as 85
percent of their Social Security benefits.

Evaluate Performance">

ALT="What's important to
you about mutual fund performance?">
<BR>

The ultimate measure of your mutual fund is
whether it enables you to
achieve your investment goal - the purchase of a
home, the financing of
your child's education or the attainment of a
comfortable retirement.
But how do you evaluate your mutual fund's
periodic progress? What
encourages you about your fund's performance and
what discourages you?
Which of the many performance measures are
meaningful and which do you
dismiss as investment world static?
<BR><BR>

These are the questions that we sought to answer
when we recently asked
several hundred thousand Kemper mutual fund
shareholders in four equity
and three income funds to complete a Kemper Pulse
survey mailed along
with their issues of <I>Kemper Reports.</I> Response to
the survey was high,
and the results are believed to be statistically
significant and
demographically sound. Highlights of the survey
findings follow.
<BR><BR>

"On their own, survey results can't and shouldn't
dictate investment
philosophy," says Stephen B. Timbers, president
of Kemper Funds.
"But they can improve our understanding of
shareholders' expectations of
their funds, and they can help frame our
communications to investors."
<BR><BR>

<!-- question 1 -->

<IMG SRC="gifs/eval_perf_question1.gif" ALT="1">
The performance of a mutual fund can be measured
a
variety of ways. What's most important to you
about your fund?
<BR><BR>

<IMG SRC="gifs/eval_perf1_chart.gif" ALT="Chart">
<BR>

<BR><BR>

<IMG SRC="gifs/eval_perf2_chart.gif" ALT="Chart">
<BR>

<BR>

Total return is widely considered to be the best
yardstick of mutual
fund performance because it takes into account
the three components of
performance: income dividends, capital gain
dividends and changes in
the value of the fund's shares. 
<BR><BR>

<!-- question 2 -->

<IMG SRC="gifs/eval_perf_question2.gif" ALT="2"
CLEAR=RIGHT>
Question #2 on the survey varied, depending on
whether it was mailed
to an income or equity fund shareholder. 
<BR><BR>

<B>Equity Funds</B>
- Individual investors have varying expectations of
their mutual funds. For example, how many years
are you prepared to give your equity fund to
appreciate in value?
<BR><BR>

<IMG SRC="gifs/eval_perf3_chart.gif" ALT="Chart">
<BR><BR>

<B>Income Funds</B>
- Individual investors have varying expectations of
their mutual funds. For example, to what extent
do you rely on your fund's dividends for your
monthly income?
<BR><BR>

<IMG SRC="gifs/eval_perf4_chart.gif" ALT="Chart">
<BR><BR>

Investors in equities are wise to give their
investment more than
five years to appreciate. The fortunes of every
company depend to
some extent upon the health of the U.S. economy.
Giving an equity
investment just one or two years to perform may
be insufficient time to
expose it to the most productive points in an
economic cycle. 
<BR><BR>

An income fund's ability to provide current
income is one of its primary
appeals. However, a mutual fund's earnings are
influenced by interest
rates and other variables that can fluctuate
significantly.

<IMG SRC="gifs/funds_vs_dividends_head.gif" ALT="The Difference Between
Mutual Fund And Stock Dividends">
<BR>

Many mutual fund shareholders mistakenly believe that a mutual fund
dividend is similar to a dividend declared by a corporation.
Corporations that pay dividends are returning a share of their profits
to their shareholders, an interim means of rewarding shareholders for
their investment. Investors have reason to be encouraged when a company
declares consecutive dividends or dividend increases. Conversely, a cut
in dividends often suggests that something is amiss.
<BR><BR>

A change in the dividend paid by a mutual fund is normally much less
meaningful. The dividend level represents the income that the fund has
earned on its investments - interest on the bonds held in an income fund
portfolio or dividends on stocks in an equity fund portfolio. Because
interest rates and the financial markets tend to move in cycles, you can
always expect some fluctuation in the income earned by your fund.
Regardless of these fluctuations, mutual funds distribute substantially
all of their income annually in order to avoid paying income tax on
their earnings.
<BR><BR>

When interest rates rise and a fund can earn more on its underlying
investments, the dividends it pays may be expected to rise. By the same
token, a drop in interest rates over an extended period of time will
result in a reduction in the interest income earned by a fund. This
decline in income earned may result in the fund being forced to cut the
dividends paid to shareholders.
<BR><BR>

Dividend income is only one way that your investment in a mutual fund
can grow. You also have the opportunity to receive capital gains
distributions, which are distributions of any profits that your fund
earns when it sells securities. Another possibility is the capital gain
(or loss) you experience when you sell your shares at a higher (or
lower) share price than your cost per share.

<IMG SRC="gifs/whats_yield_head.gif" ALT="What's In A Yield?">
<BR>

How much income will your investment yield? That is a difficult question
to answer - although some investments promise a fixed return over a
specific period of time, mutual funds do not, and you cannot consider
past yield of a mutual fund a reliable predictor of future results. 
<BR><BR>

But if only for the purpose of comparing one investment choice with
another, it makes sense to pay attention to the stated yield of an
investment. Mutual fund companies and depository institutions follow
both regulation and convention in describing an investment's yield.
Below we take a closer look at the various yields that you may see
mentioned in sales literature or advertisements.
<BR><BR>

Annual percentage yield (APY): Income earned on a bank deposit (a
certificate of deposit or money market deposit account, for example) is
described as an annual percentage yield. The yield reflects the total
amount of interest paid on a deposit account, based on the interest rate
and the frequency of compounding for a 365-day period. 
<BR><BR>

<IMG SRC="gifs/apy_chart.gif">

<BR><BR>

Current yield: You will see a current - or seven-day - yield mentioned in
money market fund advertising. This yield represents one week's income
annualized as of a specific date. It does not include realized or
unrealized gains and losses. 
<BR><BR>

<IMG SRC="gifs/current_yield_chart.gif">

<BR><BR>

Effective yield: Effective yield, in the context of fixed-price
investments such as money market funds or certificates of deposit,
includes the effect of compounding net investment income. That's why an
effective yield will be higher than a quoted yield. To understand the
difference between the yield quoted on an investment and its effective
yield, find out how frequently the income is assumed to be compounded.
You'll note a greater difference when income is compounded weekly than
quarterly or semiannually. And, remember that effective yield
presupposes that you reinvest all your income and that interest rates
remain constant. 
<BR><BR>

Current distribution rate: Current distribution rate is simply a measure
of the level of dividends distributed by a mutual fund for a specified
period. It may sometimes be greater than the fund's yield because, for
instance, it may include gains from the sale of short-term investments
and possibly long-term gains (which may be non-recurring). 
<BR><BR>

<IMG SRC="gifs/dist_rate_chart.gif">

<BR><BR>

SEC yield: The Securities and Exchange Commission requires all income
mutual funds to calculate a yield using the same standardized formula.
According to the formula (which is included in Kemper funds' 
"Statement of Additional Information" or Part B), the SEC yield is net
investment income per share earned over a specific month, expressed as
an annualized percentage of the fund's maximum offering price (the
fund's per share net asset value plus the maximum applicable sales
charge) on the last day of that month. 
<BR><BR>

Taxable-equivalent yield: You'll find a taxable-equivalent yield cited in
material that accompanies investments in municipal bonds and mutual
funds that seek to earn income exempt from federal taxes. The stated or
coupon yield of these investments will likely be lower than the yield of
investments that are taxable. However, it's possible to calculate a
tax-equivalent yield that represents the yield that you would have to
earn on a fully taxable investment before taxes to match the yield on a
tax-free investment. The marketing materials will tell you the federal
(and state, if applicable) tax rates used as a basis for calculating the
taxable-equivalent yield.
<BR><BR>

<BR><BR>

<I>This article was excerpted from the Winter/Spring 1995 issue of </I>Kemper
Reports,<I> Kemper's quarterly shareholder magazine.</I>
<BR><BR>

<IMG SRC="gifs/whats_yield_subhead.gif" ALT="Total Return Defined">
<BR>

Although yield will give you an idea of the income being generated by
your investment, total return is considered one of the best measures of the overall
performance of most mutual fund investments. (Because money market funds
seek to maintain a constant $1.00 share price, yield is the usual
measure of their performance.)
<BR><BR>

Total return is a measure of the income earned by the fund's
investments, plus the effect of any realized and unrealized appreciation
or depreciation of the investments, during a stated period of time,
assuming the reinvestment of all dividends. While yield measures only
the income component of your fund shares, total return considers three
components: income dividends, capital gain dividends and changes in the
value of your shares.

Don't Read The Prospectus">
<BR>

Every mutual fund shareholder has been provided with a prospectus at one
time or another. Ah, but have you read the prospectus?
<BR><BR>

Mutual fund prospectuses may look drearily alike but each fund company
uses the prospectus to describe its own investment policies and
practices. Most practices are reasonable and easy to understand - even
so, you'll be better off knowing them sooner rather than later. 
<BR><BR>

Here's a short list of what you might miss if you don't read the
prospectus:
<BR><BR>

<UL>
<LI> Some fund companies assess a fee every time you reinvest your
dividends.
<LI> Some fund companies assess a fee if you redeem your shares before a
prescribed time period.
<LI> Some fund companies impose a 30-day or longer waiting period before
they'll exchange your shares from one fund into another.
<LI> Some funds insist on the right to pay your redemption proceeds in
"marketable securities" instead of cash in the case of large
redemptions.

Investing">
<BR>


Some of the best things you can do for yourself - eating vegetables,
flossing your teeth and investing regularly - are the most difficult
habits to develop. None provides immediate gratification, and some are
downright disagreeable. There's no sugar surge from vegetables. Flossing
can be irritating. And when you invest a portion of your income, that
money is not available for you to spend. What, then, is the incentive to
adopt these good habits? 
<BR><BR>

The payback for a lifetime of eating peas (and Brussels sprouts and
asparagus and broccoli) is good health. Wedging that floss in and out of
your teeth can spare you the expense and discomfort of repeated
visits to the dentist. And people who invest regularly find their
motivation by in the potential for positive long-term results.
Although you can be given no guarantees, the decision to adopt a regular
investment plan can be the beginning of yet another habit that can be
good for you. 
<BR><BR>

Where do your investment dollars come from? Really, there are only two
possibilities. 
<BR><BR>

You might have a sizable amount of money (which we'll call a lump sum)
that you want to put to work toward a short-term goal, such as the
purchase of a home, or a long-term goal, such as your retirement. Lump
sums can drop into your lap for any number of reasons - possibly you
have earned a bonus, received an inheritance or settled an insurance
claim. No matter how it gets there, a lump sum distribution is an
occasion that requires an investment decision.
<BR><BR>

But lump sum payments are infrequent occurrences. If you're like most
people, any money that you have to invest must come from your current
income. You may use your income for other obligations and expenses, but
if you're going to invest for your future, you're going to have do so
out of today's income. Here's where you need discipline to develop the good
habit to invest regularly. 
<BR><BR>

It's the enviable person who can sit down, pay his bills, buy what he
wants and still have money left. It's the admirable person who follows
through by taking the money that's left and investing it. It's the rare
person, indeed, who follows this regime every pay period. 
<BR><BR>

The rest of us need the discipline of an automatic investment program.
Simply, an automatic investment program requires you to make the
decision to invest once. Once you've decided that you want to start
investing now - as opposed to waiting for that day some point in the
future when you get your lump sum - the automatic investment program can
take care of the rest. 
<BR><BR>

Where does your income come from? Whether it's from a paycheck, a
government payment or a bank account, you can establish a regular
program that will directly and automatically transfer a certain amount
into a mutual fund account. All you need to do is provide instructions
about how much should be moved and into which fund account on what date.
<BR><BR>

A program of automatic investing is easy to initiate, and this good
habit can start with a relatively small sacrifice on your part. (At
Kemper, the minimum monthly investment is $50.) 
<BR><BR>

In addition, a regular plan helps you develop a certain nonchalance.
Once you've arranged to invest a fixed amount every paycheck or every
month, you don't need to worry whether it's a "good" or "bad" time to be
making an investment. When prices are high, your fixed investment will
buy fewer shares of your fund than when prices are low. Of course, when
the price of your fund shares is low, you'll be able to accumulate more
shares. Market fluctuations shouldn't concern a regular investor with a
long-term investment horizon.
<BR><BR>

You should realize, however, that an automatic investment program cannot
assure a profit or protect against loss in a declining market. Since
this type of program involves continuous investment regardless of
fluctuating share values, you'll need to consider your financial ability
to continue the program through periods of low price levels.
<BR><BR>

<IMG SRC="gifs/autoinvesting_subhead.gif" ALT="Could you use another good habit?">
<BR>
 As a Kemper shareholder, you have your choice of three <A HREF="../shareholders/forms.html">
 automatic investment programs.</A>* All are free of charge.
<BR><BR>

<UL TYPE=CIRCLE>
<LI> You can arrange to have all or a portion of your paycheck invested
directly into a Kemper fund.
<LI> You can automatically invest directly from your checking account.
Just
select the day each month that your money should be transferred to your
mutual fund account from your checking or savings account at any bank,
savings institution or credit union.**
<LI> If you receive Social Security checks or other regular payments
from
the U.S. government or any of its agencies, you can automatically invest
all or a portion of your government check directly into a 	Kemper fund.
<BR><BR>
</UL>

*Investments may be subject to a sales charge. Please consult your
prospectus for additional information.
<BR>
**In order for you to establish a Bank Direct Deposit plan, your
financial institution must be a member of the Automated Clearing House
Association. Note that mutual fund shares are not insured or guaranteed
as bank products are, and mutual funds present a greater risk to
capital.

Kemper Shareholder Services at 1-800-621-1048.

Investment">
<BR>

To keep an eye on the progress of your investment, you can turn to many sources
of information. Here's a quick review of what Kemper provides:
<BR><BR>

<LI TYPE=CIRCLE> <B>Your quarterly statement.</B> You'll find your fund's year-to-date
total return through the end of the previous month and its average
annual
total returns as of the closing date of the previous quarter shown in
the fund summary of your quarterly statement. 
<BR><BR>

Total return and average annual total return are a measure of net
investment income and capital gain or loss from portfolio investments,
assuming that dividends are reinvested. While total returns are not
adjusted, average annual total returns are adjusted for the maximum
sales charge or the contingent deferred sales charge in effect at the
end of the period. Average annual total return reflects annualized
change while total return reflects aggregate change. 
<BR><BR>

Our goal is to mail your statement as close to the end of the quarter as
possible, which restricts our ability to print your fund's returns as of
the date of the close of that quarter. 
<BR><BR>
 
<LI TYPE=CIRCLE> <B> KemperACCESS.</B> For up-to-date Kemper fund and account information 24
hours a day, seven days a week, call our automated telephone response
system. By calling 1-800-972-3060 on a touch-tone telephone, you can
receive the following information:
<BR><BR>

<LI TYPE=CIRCLE> Account balance <BR>
<LI TYPE=CIRCLE> Most recent transactions <BR>
<LI TYPE=CIRCLE> Dividend earnings <BR>
<LI TYPE=CIRCLE> Current yields and returns <BR>
<LI TYPE=CIRCLE> Current net asset values <BR>
<BR>

Selected account transactions also are available.
<BR><BR>

Are you a first-time caller? Don't be stumped when asked to enter your
Personal Identification Number (PIN) - your PIN is the last four digits
of your Social Security number. (You can change your PIN by following
KemperACCESS instructions.)
<BR><BR>

<LI TYPE=CIRCLE> <B><I>Instant Profiles.</I></B> This quarterly publication presents performance
data about each fund in the Kemper family of funds. Asset size,
portfolio
composition and applicable duration and maturity information also are
reported. 
<BR><BR>

<LI TYPE=CIRCLE> <B>Annual and semiannual shareholder reports.</B> A comprehensive report
of your fund's six-month performance is mailed to you twice a year. In
it
you will find an economic overview from Kemper's chief investment
officer, a question-and-answer with the fund's portfolio manager and
detailed performance and financial data.
<BR><BR>

Reminder: Please remember that the performance of your individual
investment may differ from the total return reported by your fund. The
total return on your investment will depend on when you purchased your
shares, at what price and how you handle dividends and other
distributions. Your financial representative is the best source you can
turn to for help in reviewing your Kemper investment.

<IMG SRC="gifs/sig_guarantee_head.gif" ALT="What's A Signature Guarantee?">
<BR>

As a precaution against those who have no right to your invested
dollars, there are many circumstances when Kemper will require you to
provide a signature guarantee.
<BR><BR>

A signature guarantee is a certification that attests to the genuineness
of your signature. The financial institution that you obtain the
guarantee from - which could be a commercial bank, trust company,
federal savings bank, savings institution, member of a national
securities exchange or other type of eligible financial institution -
warrants that you as the signer are an "appropriate" person and that you
have "legal capacity" to sign. 
<BR><BR>

This certification goes beyond what a notary public provides. A notary
attests only to the fact that he or she witnessed an individual sign a
document. Because a notary public does not guarantee that the individual
who signed the document truly is who he or she says he is, Kemper does
not accept a notarized document where a signature guarantee is required.
<BR><BR>

These are a few examples of when you'll be asked to provide a signature
guarantee:
<BR><BR>

<UL>
<LI> When you request any change in the registration of your mutual fund
account. 
<LI> When you add certain privileges to an existing account.
<LI> When you redeem more than $50,000 from your account or when you redeem
any amount and request that the check be mailed to a different address
than is shown on the account's registration.
<LI> When you redeem an account and request that the check be mailed to an
address that has been changed within the previous 30 days.

ALT="Why Mutual Funds Waive Expenses">
<BR>
Mutual funds pursuing the same investment objective can be compared on the basis of any number of characteristics. A significant difference between their returns, however, may be a sign that a fund is either having its operating expenses absorbed or management fees waived by its investment advisor. Although they're often offered on equity funds, you're most likely to notice the effect of an absorption or waiver in the yields of a bond or money market mutual fund.  Their presence can explain how a fund is able to provide a relatively higher return to shareholders.

<P>

A look at the fund's Summary of Expenses, which is included near the front of every mutual fund prospectus, usually will reveal whether expenses are being absorbed or fees are being waived. A footnote to the summary should disclose the existence and effects of an absorption or a waiver. The Financial Highlights of a fund, included in both the prospectus and fund financial statements, also show what the expense ratio and net investment income ratio would be with and without the waivers. This information will give you some idea of how the waivers affect performance. 

<P>

Investment advisors are most likely to absorb out-of-pocket expenses or to waive management fees when they have just introduced a fund. Although every fund is capitalized with seed money from the investment advisor, one of its goals is to grow as soon as possible. Every fund needs to attain a certain size in order to initiate investments, diversify and properly pursue its investment strategy.  One of the best ways of attracting new assets is by lowering shareholder expenses and fees. 

<P>

The decision of how much to absorb and/or waive -- and for how long -- is more art than science. The difference must be enough to serve as an incentive. A new income fund whose fees and/or expenses are being waived may offer a 40 to 80 basis point (0.40 percent to .80 percent) yield advantage, for example. This tends to be sufficient to attract new shareholders.

<P>

Waivers typically remain in place for a limited time, after which the investment advisor will gradually reinstate the waived costs and fees to the fund. It is hoped that the fund will be large enough to better absorb the waived fees by the time they are added back.

<P>

Such waivers are common with fund introductions. Some investment advisors also make a practice of waiving the expenses and fees of a more mature fund. When this is done and the fund is thereby able to produce a higher yield, the investment advisor is making a marketing decision to incur the fund's expenses and forgo fee income in favor of asset growth for the fund. The reason for this strategy is that a larger fund will provide certain economies of scale that should lead to reduced ongoing costs. You should know, though, that an investment advisor typically reserves the right to stop the practice and reinstate the fund's true expenses and fees at any time.

<IMG SRC="gifs/rainy_day_head.gif" ALT="Do You Need A Rainy Day Fund?">
<BR>

By definition, an emergency - an automobile accident, a sudden illness,
the loss of a job - is something that's not planned. You can plan how
you're going to finance your child's education and you can prepare for
your eventual retirement, but how do you know how much money you might
need in the case of an emergency? It's impossible to know.
<BR><BR>

Yet the inability to predict exactly how much you may need should not
have the effect of discouraging your planning - sooner or later a little
rain is going to fall in everyone's life. When you experience the sudden
occurrence of an event that requires significant financial resources,
you're going to want a rainy day fund.
<BR><BR>

What's a rainy day fund? It's a sum of money that you set aside to be
available when you need it. The rain may fall at any point, and your
fund should help bail you out. Once you decide to establish a rainy day
fund, the next two questions are: How much do you need to set aside and
where will you keep it?
<BR><BR>

As a general rule, some experts recommend that you keep the equivalent
of your net income for three to six months in a readily available
source. If you lose your job, for example, the rainy day fund should
shield you from the elements until you can find a new one. (You may need
to increase the amount of your reserve if you think that it will take
longer than six months to get a new job.) 
<BR><BR>

Projecting the amount of income you'd expect to have to replace will
give you one measure of how much you should have set aside. An
alternative is to estimate the total expenses you'd need to meet while
you were out of work or in the midst of any other financial crisis.
<BR><BR>

Where will you keep your rainy day money? These are a few points to
consider when evaluating the suitability of a money market fund and an
account at a financial institution:
<BR><BR>

<LI TYPE=CIRCLE> <B>Stability.</B> Remember that the purpose of this rainy day money
is to
give you peace of mind at a time when you're likely to be experiencing
stress. An emergency is no time to find out that the dollars you're
counting on using have dwindled. 
<BR><BR>

Given their potential for price fluctuation, certain types of mutual
funds
may not be appropriate investments for an emergency fund. Money market
funds, 
however, can be an alternative to financial institution accounts.
<BR><BR>

Money market funds are neither insured nor guaranteed by the U.S.
government and there can be no assurance that a stable net asset value
of $1 per share will be maintained. Money market shares represent a
greater risk to capital than certificates of deposit or savings
accounts.
While principal and interest in a savings account with a financial
institution is guaranteed, and the account is generally insured by the
Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation. 
<BR><BR>

<LI TYPE=CIRCLE> <B>Access.</B> The checkwriting privilege available with money
market funds
assures you immediate access to your rainy day fund no matter what time
the rain falls. Access to savings accounts will vary from financial
institution to financial institution. If you keep invest your money in a
certificate of deposit, however, remember that you may be subject to a
penalty for early withdrawal.
<BR><BR>

<LI TYPE=CIRCLE> <B>Yield.</B> Unlike other investments you have, the earning
ability of your
rainy day fund may be of less concern to you. However, there are
important differences between mutual fund and financial institution
accounts. 
<BR><BR>

Money market funds, such as those offered by Kemper, seek to maximize
current income while maintaining the stability of the principal. Money
market fund yields generally fluctuate daily, responding to changes in
prevailing interest rates. Mutual funds are required to distribute
substantially all of their income. Bank products offer fixed or variable
yields that are set by the financial institution and changed at its
discretion. 
<BR><BR>

prospectus in addition to those you
already have, please call Kemper Shareholder Services at 1-800-621-1048,

fees and expenses. Please read it carefully before you invest or send

<IMG SRC="gifs/dontdaydream_head.gif" ALT="Do's And Don'ts For Daydreamers">
<BR>

It's Saturday morning and you're indulging in a little daydreaming.
While your financial advisors would prefer to think that you're dreaming
about financing your retirement, your dream this morning is about how to
get that new car...or how to swing a week or two in the islands...or how
to achieve just about any number of short-term investment goals.
<BR><BR>

At one point or another, we all have to make some decisions about how to
invest for the short term. In the case of a bonus or inheritance or lump
sum distribution, you may have a plan for how you're going to use money
that suddenly becomes available - yet you don't want it sitting idle in
the interim. On the other hand, you may want to set aside funds toward a
certain goal you expect to reach in the not-so-distant future, such as a
new car or vacation, and you want them to be earning until you need to
access it.
<BR><BR>

What do you do? Whatever you do (and you'll want to consult your
financial representative for specific advice), be sure to recognize that
your approach to investing for the short-term will vary somewhat from
what you'd do as a long-term investor.
<BR><BR>

<B>These are just a few points that you'll want to keep in mind:</B>
<BR><BR>

<UL TYPE=CIRCLE>
<LI> In all likelihood, you are counting on a specific dollar amount to
achieve your goal. The stability of your principal, then, will have to
be more important to you than its return. Remember that the pursuit of
higher returns implies a higher level of risk. Because of your imminent
need for your money, you may not be able to withstand the degree of
volatility that would be acceptable to someone who has committed his or
her funds for the long term. You'll need an investment whose objective
is preservation of capital.
<BR><BR>

<LI> Access may be more important to you as a short-term investor. You'll
want to avoid investments that restrict (and these restrictions could be
in the form of penalties on withdrawals or limited service hours) your
ability to withdraw funds at any time. 
<BR><BR>

<LI> Pay attention to the fees that accompany investments. The fee
structure of some investments assumes that you have an extended
investment horizon and expect to remain invested for years. 
<BR><BR>
</UL>

That's true, for example, of mutual fund shares purchased in Class A and
Class B of Kemper mutual funds. Class C shares of Kemper funds may be
most appropriate for investors who anticipate a relatively short
investment period. 
<BR><BR>

Investors in Class A shares pay an upfront sales charge, and investors
in Class B shares purchase their shares with the understanding that
redemptions during the first six years may be subject to a contingent
deferred sales charge. Class B shares also pay an annual distribution
services fee of 0.75 percent for six years. Class C provides an
alternative for those who want to be able to redeem their shares at any
time without charge. In lieu of a sales charge, an annual distribution
services charge of 0.75 percent is assessed on Class C shares. (These
somewhat higher expenses will result in lower income and capital gain
distributions on a per share basis than are earned on Class A shares,
and the distribution fee for Class C shares remains in place regardless
of how long a shareholder owns the shares.) 
<BR><BR>

already have, please call Kemper Shareholder Services at 1-800-621-1048,

<BR>

If you're saving to buy a home, the down payment on your purchase will
most likely be your first and largest hurdle. But, if you're like most
home buyers, the spending doesn't stop once you've crossed the threshold
to your new home.
<BR><BR>

Then you'll need funds for furnishings (furniture, household
decorations, kitchen housewares and floor and window coverings) and
improvements such as landscaping and the building of patios, fences and
driveways.
<BR><BR>

According to calculations by the National Association of Home Builders,
in the first three months after their purchase, new homeowners spend 25 to
35 percent more of their income each month than non-moving homeowners
do. This burst of spending, which continues but at a slower pace for the
next several months, totals an estimated $6,475 in the first full year
after the purchase.

<BR>


The American dream of taking the wheel of a brand new automobile and
heading down the highway has become a dream less available to the middle
class. 
<BR><BR>

According to Zurich Kemper Investments Economist David Hale, auto prices have
risen so sharply during recent years that today's new auto buyer has an
average income that's about 40 percent above the national median
household income. Ten years ago, new auto buyers had a household income
that was about 20 percent above the national median, according to Hale. 
<BR><BR>

For the would-be car buyer, these higher auto prices may require a more
planned, longer term investment strategy. To the economy and to auto
manufacturers, Hale says, "This compression in the share of population
now able to qualify for new auto purchases has greatly increased the
sensitivity of auto sales to factors that influence the income or
confidence of people in the top income quintile of the population." The
1995 income tax hike, for example, hurt upper-income Americans and
resulted in an auto slump, Hale says.

new car buyer commits about as much of his or her disposable income as

point, when a new car purchase consumed the smallest amount of the buyer's
disposable income.</FONT SIZE=-1></B><BR>

<BR>

Many people know that a money market mutual fund strives to maintain a $1.00 net asset value per share. But how is this accomplished? Understanding how a money market mutual fund "works" requires some consideration of its investments.

<P>

A money market fund typically has two objectives: to generate income and to 
preserve principal, which is represented by net asset value (NAV). The desire to preserve principal guides the fund manager's selection of income-producing investments -- a money fund invests in high quality, short-term securities. The high quality is intended to help guard the fund against credit risk while short maturities are intended to help reduce exposure to interest rate risk.  

<P>

These are a few of the possible investments that a money market fund might include in its portfolio:

<P>

<LI TYPE=CIRCLE> <B>Obligations of or guaranteed by the U.S. government, its agencies or instrumentalities.</B> 
Short-term government obligations are considered to be the safest short-term investments. 
(Of course, any U.S. government guarantee of the securities owned by the portfolio does not guarantee the 
net asset value of its shares.) 
<P>
<LI TYPE=CIRCLE> <B>Commercial paper obligations with very high ratings.</B> This is a form of unsecured 
debt issued by corporations -- their good name and financial strength is the 
investor's security. Commercial paper can range in maturity from 1 to 270 days, with the interest rate generally rising with the time to maturity. 
<P>
<LI TYPE=CIRCLE> <B>Bank certificates of deposit (CDs).</B> A money market mutual fund will often purchase 
large denomination ($100,000-plus) bank CDs. The rate of return on a CD is commensurate with its size and length 
of term to maturity. 
<P>
<LI TYPE=CIRCLE> <B>Repurchase agreements.</B> In a repurchase agreement  (also called a repo), the money fund will buy primarily U.S. government or agency obligations from a dealer on the condition that the dealer will repurchase the security back at a mutually agreed upon time and price. Such an agreement enables the manager to "lock in" a maturity and yield.
<P>
The short-term nature of the investments in the portfolio requires continual monitoring of events. Fiscal policy (such as federal taxation and spending plans), monetary policy (particularly the Federal Reserve Board's action on interest rates) and legislative policy also can influence how a money fund manager will invest.

<P>
If a manager expects interest rates to rise, the fund might have a much shorter average maturity -- so when 
assets are sold, the proceeds can be invested at the higher rates. On the other hand, if the forecast calls for a decline in interest rates, the manager might want to invest in longer maturity investments to benefit from higher interest rates as long as possible. Again, all investment decisions are based within the framework of preserving principal.
<P>

Please read it carefully before you invest or send money.</I>

<P>

<I>An investment in a money market fund is neither insured nor guaranteed by the U.S. government, and there 
can be no assurance that the fund will be able to maintain a stable net asset value of $1.00 per share.</I>

What's one of the best gifts you can give your child? Parents who teach
their children "that money you put away is not gone forever" have
significantly influenced their children's retirement savings habits,
according to B. Douglas Bernheim, an academic economist at Stanford
University. 
<BR><BR>

Bernheim says his research has demonstrated a strong link between
childhood experiences and adult behavior. Specifically, individuals who
were encouraged to maintain a bank account as a child saved 108 percent
more for their retirement when they became adults than those who did not
have a childhood bank account. Children who received allowances saved 36
percent more as adults, according to Bernheim.
<BR><BR>

If you'd like to use a mutual fund to reinforce the importance of
investing for tomorrow, it is possible to establish an account in the
child's name. The account will be set up according to the rules of the
Uniform Gift to Minors Act (UGMA) or Uniform Transfer to Minors Act
(UTMA). The custodian you select when establishing the gift account will
have exclusive control of the investment until the child comes of age
(age 18 or 21 depending upon your state of residence). However,
duplicate copies of the quarterly statement can be mailed to the child.
And, of course, the child can participate by monitoring the progress of
his or her investment every day in the newspaper, on financial
television programs or via on-line computer services.

Junior year. Years ago it was considered the best year in high school -
those gawky years were all but forgotten but it was still too soon to
fret about college. Unfortunately, that's not the case today - at least
not for the parents of a high school junior. In fact, some financial
planning should take place when the student is a sophomore.
<BR><BR>

The year before a student heads for college is the pivotal year used by
many financial aid officers to determine financial aid eligibility. Your
income and assets will be reviewed each year but the so-called first
base income year is the one that sets the precedent. The base year
starts on January 1 of the student's junior year to December 31 of that
year (when, if all has gone well, the student is halfway through senior
year).
<BR><BR>

The following are a few tips from the <I>Detroit News-Free Press</I> on how to
improve your chances for qualifying for aid:
<BR><BR>

<UL TYPE=CIRCLE>
<LI> Cash in U.S. savings bonds earmarked for college before the base
income year begins. Once the cash is in the bank, it's considered an
asset, not income. Financial aid offices expect parents to devote as
much as 47 percent of their income to college but only 5.65 percent of
their assets.
<LI> If you usually get large income tax refunds, reduce your withholding
the year before the base income year. Refunds show up as income the
following year for taxpayers who itemize.
<LI> Try to have bonuses paid in a year other than the base income year.
Avoid all pension or IRA distributions.
</UL>

There are many gifts you can give a special youngster, but very few have
the potential to appreciate over time. A Kemper fund investment
provides the opportunity to grow with a child - without getting lost,
broken or forgotten as the child matures.
<P>

Whether your gift will help finance college or other future needs, a
mutual fund can be one of the most significant gifts a child can receive
because the more time it has to grow, the greater value a mutual fund
can potentially provide.
<P>

Kemper offers several mutual funds that could be well suited for a
child's portfolio because of their long-term investment objectives. And,
according to the Uniform Gift to Minors Act (UGMA) or Uniform Transfer
to Minors Act (UTMA), a mutual fund gift to a child can provide certain
tax benefits, based on current law in most states.
<P>

For more information about giving the gift of a Kemper fund, please call 
your financial representative or Kemper Shareholder Services 1-800-621-1048. 
We'll be happy to send you a gift kit, including  
<A HREF="../prospectus.html">prospectuses</A> containing more complete details 
about custodial accounts and an attractive gift card and envelope.

Fund Compares With The Gift Of A U.S. Savings Bond">
<BR>

Many parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles have traditionally given
U.S. savings bonds to children. U.S. savings bonds can be given directly
or transferred according to the rules of the Uniform Gift to Minors Act
(UGMA) or Uniform Transfer to Minors Act (UTMA). The only way to give a
Kemper fund gift to a child is to establish an UGMA/UTMA account.
Here's how the gift of a U.S. savings bond compares to the gift of a
Kemper fund account.

Kemper offers a range of funds with varying objectives. At one end of the risk/return spectrum are funds whose primary objective is the growth of capital (<A HREF="../funds/smallcapequity.html">Kemper Small Capitalization Equity Fund</A>, <A HREF="../funds/smallcapequity.html">Kemper-Dreman Small Cap Value Fund</A>, <A HREF="../funds/technology.html">Kemper Technology Fund</A> and <A HREF="../funds/asian_growth.html">Kemper Asian Growth Fund</A>). At the other end of the risk/return spectrum are <A HREF="../funds/mmfunds.html">Kemper money market funds</A> whose objective is maximum current income consistent with the stability of principal. 
<BR><BR>
Mutual funds are neither insured nor guaranteed by the U.S. government and present greater risk to capital than U.S. savings bonds. Returns and net asset value will fluctuate. Money market funds seek to maintain a stable $1 share value, although there can be no assurance that they will. Investment by <A HREF="../funds/smallcapequity.html">Kemper Small Capitalization Equity Fund</A>, <A HREF="../funds/smallcapequity.html">Kemper-Dreman Small Cap Value Fund</A> and <A HREF="../funds/technology.html">Kemper Technology Fund</A> in smaller companies presents greater risk than an investment in larger, more established companies. Also, investment in international securities presents special risk considerations including exchange rates, government regulations and differences in liquidity.

A savings bond is purchased at half its face value or denomination and
it is guaranteed to accrue interest  until it equals its face value.
<BR><BR>
Previously, a guaranteed minimum interest rate enabled investors to
project how long they'd need to hold the bond before it reached its
value. Starting May 1, 1995, the U.S. Treasury abandoned its practice of
offering a guaranteed minimum rate in favor of "market-based rates" that
will be set on May 1 and November 1 of every year. 
<BR><BR>
On savings bonds less than five years old, the U.S. Treasury pays 85 percent
of the average of six-month Treasury security yields or 4.56 percent
as of November 1, 1996. Rates paid on savings bonds that are five years or older are
85% of the average of five-year Treasury security yields or 5.53 percent
as of November 1, 1996.
<BR><BR>
If a savings bond earning market rates has not reached face value after
17 years, the government will make a one-time adjustment to make the
redemption value at least equal to the face amount.

Starting with savings bonds sold on May 1, 1995, interest is credited
six months after its issue date and every six months thereafter. The

For Gift-Givers?">
<BR>

Both the gift of a mutual fund and the gift of a U.S. savings bond
qualify for the $10,000 annual gift tax exclusion. If your spouse
consents and you file IRS Form 709 (this form can be retrieved from the <A HREF="http://www.irs.ustreas.gov/prod/cover.html">IRS web site</A>), 
you and your spouse may give up to
$20,000 per year tax-free to each child.

<P>

In addition, the establishment of an UGMA/UTMA for a mutual fund gift
(which is the only way an investment in a Kemper fund can be
given to a child) or for a U.S. savings bond provides certain tax
benefits. If you establish an UGMA/UTMA and as long as the child's
income tax return is filed separately from yours, the first $650 in
earnings from your gift is tax-free until the year in which the child
turns 14. The second $650 in earnings from the gift is taxed at the
child's income tax rate which, presumably, is the lowest federal tax
rate of 15 percent. Any earnings above $1,300 are taxed at the parent's
income tax rate (subject to annual adjustment for inflation). 

<P>

After the child reaches 14, all income beyond the first $650 in earnings
from the gift is taxed at his or her income tax rate. These rules apply
regardless of who makes the gift.  

<P>

You should note that there are additional tax benefits available to a
U.S. savings bondholder, whether the bond is received directly or
through the UGMA/UTMA. For example, earnings on U.S. savings bonds are
free of state and local taxes. Also, the bondholder can choose to
declare earned interest each year or defer declaring the interest until
the bond is redeemed or the date interest stops accruing, which is after
30 years.  

<P>

There are some mutual funds that invest in municipal bonds (click here to learn about <A HREF="../funds/taxfree.html">Kemper Tax-Free Income Funds</A>) and offer
income free of federal and, in some cases, state and local taxes. A
portion of the income may be subject to the alternative minimum tax for
certain investors. The appropriateness of investing in such mutual funds
may depend on the child's income tax rate. 

<P>

For more information about giving the gift of a Kemper fund, <A HREF="../learn/contact_learn.html">send us an e-mail now</A> or call your financial representative or Kemper Shareholder Services
at (800) 621-1048. We'll be happy to send you a gift kit, including

charges and expenses, additional information about custodial accounts
and a convenient gift card and envelope. Please be sure to read the
prospectus carefully before you invest or send money.

If you had invested $1,000 in U.S. savings bonds 20 years ago, you would
have been guaranteed a steady increase in your investment. No such
assurance was available from the stock market, as you can see from the
up and down performance of the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index. However,
the return on $1,000 invested in the stock market, as represented by the
S&amp;P 500, would have been more than three times the return on the U.S.
savings bonds. The data for both the U.S. savings bonds and the S&amp;P
500 track the performance of $1,000 invested from October 1, 1976, through
September 30, 1996.
<BR><BR>

This information is historical and does not represent future performance
of the S&amp;P 500 index or U.S. savings bonds. The <A HREF="http://www.stockinfo.standardpoor.com/brochure/idxdirs.htm">S&amp;P 500</A> is an
unmanaged
index of common stocks that's generally considered representative of the
U.S. stock market. The performance of the index is not intended to be
representative of the past or future performance of any Kemper <A HREF="../funds/capgrowth.html">capital growth
fund.</A> There are important differences between the S&amp;P 500 stocks and
U.S. savings bonds. For example,
stocks have fluctuating investment return and principal while a U.S.
savings bond has a fixed principal and is guaranteed by the U.S.
government to accrue interest until the principal and accrued interest
equal the face value of the savings bond.

This information is historical and does not represent future performance of Kemper Funds, the S&amp;P 500 index or U.S. savings bonds. The S&amp;P 500 is an unmanaged index of common stocks that's generally considered representative of the U.S. stock market. There are important differences between these investments. For example, stocks have fluctuating investment return and principal while bonds have both fixed principal and return if held to maturity and their value will vary prior to maturity. A U.S. savings bond has a fixed principal and is guaranteed by the U.S. government to accrue interest until the principal and accrued interest equal the face value of the savings bond. 
<P>
Please note that investments by <A HREF="../funds/smallcapequity.html">Kemper Small Capitalization Equity Fund</A> and <A HREF="../funds/technology.html">Kemper Technology Fund</A> in small companies presents greater risk than investments in larger, more established companies. An investor may not make a direct investment in the S&#38;P 500.

<IMG SRC="gifs/factscustodial_head.gif" ALT="About Custodial
Accounts">
<BR>

It's easy to open a gift account at Kemper. And, if the gift is
established to meet the requirements of your state's Uniform Gift to
Minors Act (UGMA) or Uniform Transfer to Minors Act (UTMA), it can enjoy
unique tax benefits. According to current Uniform Gift rules, you can
open a mutual fund account in a child's name and designate yourself, a
spouse or a friend to administer it until the youngster reaches adult
age. It is not necessary that the custodian be a parent.
<BR><BR>

<B>Q: How do I establish a gift account with Kemper?</B><BR>
<B>A:</B> Simply obtain the child's Social Security number and appoint a
custodian to manage the account. Complete a new account application,
making certain to check the box in Section 1, "Gift to a Minor," and
enter the names of the custodian and minor where indicated.
<BR><BR>

The minimum investment amount for a custodial account is $1,000 unless
you establish an <A HREF="autoinvesting.html">automatic investment plan</A>, in which case you can set up
an account for as little as $50. If you choose to establish an automatic
investment plan, be sure to complete Section 12 on the application.
<BR><BR><BR>

<B>Q: What are the responsibilities of the custodian?</B> <BR>
<B>A:</B> The custodian for the account controls the money - how it is
invested
and spent - until the child legally comes of age. In most cases, the
legal age is 18 or 21 for the purposes of the Uniform Acts. However,
some states allow custodianship to extend beyond the age of majority. 
<BR><BR>

Here's a tip to bear in mind: As a parent, if you name yourself as
custodian and you die before your child becomes an adult (an adult is
often defined by the statutes as either age 18 or 21), the value of the gift account may be
included as part of your estate for federal tax purposes. In this case, you
may wish to consult your tax advisor about alternatives such as naming
some person other than yourself as custodian. Or, if you and your spouse make the gift
jointly, consider a third-party custodian.
<BR><BR><BR>

<B>Q: What happens when the child reaches the age of majority?</B> <BR>
<B>A:</B> When the child reaches the adult age designated by the state
for
ending the custodianship, the assets are his or hers to spend or to
invest in any way. The money you invest on behalf of a child is
considered an irrevocable gift. The account you've established in one
child's name, for example, cannot be transferred to the name of another
minor.
<BR><BR><BR>

<B>Q: What Kemper funds may I establish a gift account in?</B> <BR>
<B>A:</B> Kemper offers a range of funds that could be well suited for a
child's portfolio. <A HREF="../funds/spectrum.html">(Click here to view the Kemper Funds Risk/Return Spectrum.)</A> Your financial representative can help answer your
specific investing questions.
<BR><BR><BR>

<B>Q: What are the tax benefits of establishing a gift account for a
child?</B> <BR>
<B>A:</B> For children under the age of 14, the Internal Revenue Service
treats
a child's first $650 of unearned income ("unearned" means not
representing compensation for services) as tax-free. The second $650 of
unearned income is taxed at the child's marginal tax rate of 15 percent.
Any unearned income over $1,300 is taxed at the parent's top marginal
tax rate. (The parent's rate applies even if the gift comes from someone
else). This means that for an investment earning a hypothetical 8
percent* annually, you could have up to $16,250 in the child's name and
still qualify for favorable tax treatment on the $1,300 of income. For
children 14 years and older (at the end of the tax year), all earnings
after the first $650 are taxed at the child's tax rate.
<BR><BR>

You can further enhance the potential tax benefits of the gift by
choosing an investment strategy that emphasizes capital appreciation
over income. While income dividends are taxed up to the highest marginal
tax rate of 39.6 percent, the current maximum tax on capital gains is 28
percent. Growth stocks often pay low or no dividends because earnings
are needed to finance further growth. That being the case, capital growth
funds may be better from a current tax perspective (especially for
children under age 14). Keep in mind, however, that capital growth mutual
funds often make an annual distribution of any realized capital gains 
which would be taxable when distributed.
<BR><BR>

The procedures for calculating the tax for children under age 14 can be
very complex, with the amount of tax dependent upon both the type of
income (earned versus unearned) and the amount of deductions offsetting
that income. Additional information may be found in the U.S. Savings Bond Investor Information Guide, which is available from the <A HREF="http://www.ustreas.gov/treasury/bureaus/pubdebt/save.html">Savings Bond page</A> of the U.S. Treasury web site. You may wish to consult with a tax, legal or other advisor
for more information, particularly if these gifts are to be part of a
larger financial plan. Please call Kemper's Shareholder Services
representatives at (800) 621-1048 for answers to administrative
questions.
<BR><BR>

<I>*This assumed rate is for purposes of the illustration only and is not
intended to represent the return of a specific investment, which will
fluctuate.</I>
<BR><BR><BR>

<B>Q: Does a Kemper Fund gift account qualify for the gift tax
exclusion?</B> <BR>
<B>A:</B> Yes, an UGMA gift qualifies for the $10,000 annual gift tax
exclusion. If your spouse consents and you file IRS Form 709 (this form can be retrieved from the <A HREF="http://www.irs.ustreas.gov/prod/">IRS web site</A>), you and
your spouse may give up to $20,000 per year tax-free to each child.

<IMG SRC="gifs/special_planning_head.gif" ALT="Pre-Retirees Have Special Planning Pressures"><BR>

<I>Anyone can leap tall buildings in a single bound.
Dodging speeding bullets is overrated.
But 
who can plan a retirement
when they
have their own job to do,
are worried about getting their kids started out right in life
and are helping their parents age comfortably?</I><P>


<IMG SRC="gifs/special_planning1_subhead.gif" ALT="Now That's A Job For Super You!"><BR>

If anyone can fill the tights of a superhero, it has to be today's 50- to 64-year-olds. If you're in that age group, you know what the pressures are: <P>

<UL>
<LI>Eight out of 10 pre-retirees (those in the 50-plus generation) have adult children, almost one-third of whom live with their parents. Many parents who married "later in life" are paying all or some of their children's college expenses.*<P>

<LI>In part because their parents married and had their children "early" in their lives, half of all pre-retirees have at least one living parent; 22 percent have two living parents. Considering their in-laws, as well, 70 percent of pre-retirees have a parent for whom they have some financial responsibilities.*<P>

<LI>Between 16 and 30 percent of the 50-plus generation are estimated to have set aside nothing toward their retirement due, for the most part, to financial difficulties.**<P>

<LI>Women in this generation often quit full-time employment to spend 18 hours a day or more serving as a home nurse without pay.***<P>
</UL>
<BR>

Well, superhero, we'd like you to walk back into that telephone booth and transform yourself into plain old average Clark or Clarkina Kent - who will be retiring in the next 10 to 15 years. We'd like you to contemplate your retirement and how you might prepare for it. (And if it helps at all, you might want to think of your retirement years as one powerful locomotive barreling toward you.)

<IMG SRC="gifs/early_ira_head.gif" ALT="How Early IRA Contributions Can Add Up">
<BR>

<IMG SRC="gifs/early_ira_subhead.gif" ALT="What's the big fuss about April 15?">
<BR>

Have you ever stopped to consider what you're missing out on by
waiting until the last possible minute to make your Individual Retirements Account (IRA) contribution? 
<BR><BR>

Making a contribution just in the nick of time has become standard
practice for many taxpayers. It's understandable, perhaps, for taxpayers
who qualify for a tax-deductible contribution - they can use a
last-minute IRA contribution to reduce the amount of income they'll pay
tax on. 
<BR><BR>

But, because their annual incomes exceed the current IRS limits,
many taxpayers cannot qualify for a tax-deductible IRA. The benefit of
an IRA to all taxpayers is the ability to build a retirement
account whose earnings can grow free from taxes until the account is
distributed, at which time they may be taxed as ordinary income. 
(Distributions prior to 59 1/2
may be subject to a 10 percent penalty.) 
<BR><BR>

The opportunity to build an IRA - through an annual contribution of a
maximum of $2,000 - becomes available every year, starting on January 1
of the tax year. This "window of opportunity" remains open until, in
most years, April 15 of the next year. 
<BR><BR>

Are you sneaking through that window on the last possible date? If you
are, you're foregoing a maximum of 15 months of potential earnings that
can compound free from current taxes! We'll show you why it can be to
your advantage to be ready with your IRA contribution when the window
opens rather than when it's closing. Many savvy IRA investors have
already made and/or are making their 1996 tax year contributions now. 
<BR><BR>

<IMG SRC="gifs/early_ira2_subhead.gif" ALT="What's so special about April 15?">
<BR>
We can think of at least four other dates when contributing to your IRA
makes more sense.
<BR><BR>

The true benefit of the IRA is its ability to compound earnings that are
not taxed until a distribution is made. The sooner you make your
contribution, the sooner your investment can start working on a tax-deferred 
basis for you. To
illustrate, we've selected four dates to show how the earnings of a
hypothetical fixed-income investment could grow, in the tax year alone
and over a period of 30 years ending on April 15. And to give you an
idea of the value of tax-deferred investing, we also show how much the
same hypothetical investment dollars would earn over the same time
period - if their earnings were taxed every year. We assume a 36% income
tax rate in this example.
<BR><BR>

To illustrate the powerful effect of tax-deferred income growth, we've
had to assume a specific fixed growth rate - we've used 8 percent,
compounded monthly. This assumed rate is for illustrative purposes only
and is not intended to represent performance of any specific investment,
which will fluctuate. A program of regular investing cannot assume a
profit nor protect against a loss in a declining market. Since this type
of program involves continuous investment regardless of fluctuating share
values, you'll need to consider your financial ability to continue
the program through periods of low price levels. More important
than the absolute numbers, then, is the growth of an investment
initiated early in the tax year versus the growth of an investment
initiated on the last possible date each year.

<IMG SRC="gifs/dontretdist_head.gif" ALT="Don't Touch Your Retirement
Plan Distribution!">
<BR>

So, congratulations are in order. You've just gotten a new job and well
wishes abound. You're feeling on top of the world when you hear from a
representative of your (soon-to-be-former) company's retirement plan:
What are your plans for the sum that's been accumulating in your name?
<BR><BR>

Of course, you're going to be tempted. (It's how much?) But this is more
than a left side of the brain/right side of the brain problem
confronting you. From a tax perspective, deciding whether to take your
distribution in cash or whether to roll it over is a struggle between
right and wrong. 
<BR><BR>

What should you do with your retirement plan distribution? This is one
of very few topics on which investment advisors are in complete
agreement. 
<BR><BR>
<B> Conventional Wisdom </B>
<BR><BR>
The "right" answer to the question, "What should I do with my
retirement plan distribution?" is based on a few assumptions:
<UL>
<LI> Because your contribution to your retirement plan is deducted from
your pay even before you see it (matched in some cases by employer
contributions), retirement plans are among the easiest ways to plan for
a comfortable future.
<LI> Time has a value of its own. You can never recover the time you've
already spent building a tax-deferred retirement plan.
<LI> Investments that compound on a tax-deferred basis (without their
current balances being reduced by the need to pay taxes every year) have
higher earning potential.
<LI> By virtue of their tax-deferred status, retirement plans are
endorsed
by the federal government - conversely, the government penalizes most
premature (before the age of 59 1/2) distributions from
retirement
plans.
<LI> Most investors go out of their way to minimize the amount they pay
in
federal income tax.
</UL>
<BR><BR>

<B>Your decision</B>
<BR>
You are 30 years old and your plan payout totals $20,000.
<BR><BR>

<B>You have three choices:</B>
<BR><BR>
<B>1. </B>You can take your distribution in cash.
<BR><BR> 

Do that and, assuming you're in the 28 percent tax bracket, you will owe
the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) 28 percent of $20,000 or $5,600 in
current income taxes. Plus, as a general rule, you'll have to pay a 10
percent penalty, or $2,000 more, for taking the distribution before
reaching age 59 1/2.
<BR><BR>

You'll have $12,400 left from your plan.
<BR><BR>

<B>2. </B>You can take your distribution in cash and move it into an
Individual
Retirement Account (IRA) or you may be able to move the cash into a
qualified retirement plan of your new company within 60 days of
receiving the check.
<BR><BR>

Your employer is required by the IRS to withhold 20 percent of your
distribution ($4,000) as a prepayment of your potential tax liability.
You won't owe current income taxes on the remaining amount - $16,000 -
as long as you roll it over within 60 days. 
<BR><BR>

Even if you roll over the $16,000 cash distribution within 60 days,
you'll owe current income taxes (28 percent of $4,000 or $1,120) and
applicable early withdrawal penalties (10 percent of $4,000 or $400) on
the $4,000 your employer paid to the IRS. The difference between the
$4,000 prepayment and the $1,520 in income taxes due represents a tax
credit, which the IRS will refund to you (less any additional income
taxes you may owe) after you file your tax return.
<BR><BR>

<B>3. </B>You could request your employer to transfer your distribution
directly into an IRA or possibly into a qualified retirement plan of
your new company. Where should your distribution be invested? Your
financial representative can review the possibilities with you.
<BR><BR>

Selecting this option would keep all $20,000 of your plan assets working
for you and you'd continue to
defer taxes until you withdraw money from your account. 
<BR><BR>

The hypothetical examples in the above graph assume a 28 percent income
tax bracket and an 8 percent return, compounded monthly. This assumed
rate of return is for illustrative purposes only and is not intended to
represent performance of any specific investment, which may fluctuate.
IRA and qualified retirement plan assets will be subject to current
income taxes at the time of withdrawal, under current tax law.
Calculations assume a 28 percent annual income tax liability on the
amount invested in a taxable investment.

In advertisements and newspaper articles and from your financial
representative directly, you'll be hearing a lot about retirement
planning from Kemper Funds in 1996. Retirement planning is a process
that can never be started too soon and should continue throughout one's
retirement years.

As a means of demonstrating our commitment to retirees and enhancing our
understanding of older adults, Kemper has become a corporate member of

<IMG SRC="gifs/price_retdream_head.gif" ALT="The Price Of Your
Retirement Dream">
<BR>

It's easy for us to put a price tag on what your retirement dream costs
today. Much more difficult is your job - you need to project what it
will take to realize that dream tomorrow, six months or 30 years from
now. 
<BR><BR>

What do you want to do in your retirement and what financial resources
do you need to accomplish those dreams? 
<BR><BR>

These are the two questions that both retirees and those not yet retired
must ask and answer as they plan for an unknown future. 
<BR><BR>

Whether we like it or not, money is a means to an end, and that's
particularly true when it comes to retirement. Indeed, your financial
state can dictate your retirement age. 
<BR><BR>

Today, according to research by Georgetown University, 63 is the median
retirement age for both men and women. Many of those who continue to
work beyond age 63 are those who feel their financial resources are
insufficient. 
<BR><BR>

Americans' retirement income comes from four basic sources - Social
Security, asset income, pensions and earnings. The percentage
contributed by each has been shifting over the years, with the decline
in Social Security income being the most notable change.  
<BR><BR>

How much total income is needed to finance the retirement you've dreamed
about? You must consider the income and growth potential of your assets
against your retirement objectives. Be forewarned: This will be an
analysis chocked with imponderables - prevailing inflation rates, your
age at retirement, how long you live after you retire, the size of your
Social Security and employee benefits, your post-retirement obligations
and your plans. 
<BR><BR>

Establishing and following through on an investment plan that can take
you to retirement and beyond can be a daunting task. To keep yourself
motivated, we suggest that you visualize your dream and work toward it.
Every individual has his or her own vision of retirement, of course.
Generally, though, as a retiree you ought to be able to... 
<BR><BR>

<IMG SRC="gifs/price_retdream1_subhead.gif" ALT="Go Where You Want To
Go...">
<BR>
After years of meeting a work schedule, you're free to go whenever and
wherever you please. 
<BR><BR>

Your dream may be to travel to see new sights and or stroll down
different streets. For a permanent change of scenery or climate, you may
want to relocate. 
<BR><BR>

Then again, you may not want to go anywhere. In a 1992 American
Association of Retired Persons survey, more than eight out of 10 people
aged 55 and older said they'd like to stay in their current homes. If
that's your decision, your retirement income should provide for you to
cover your maintenance expenses. Let someone else mow the lawn or shovel
the snow. You may want to invest in some modifications that enable you
to stay in your home as long as you want. 
<BR><BR>

<IMG SRC="gifs/price_retdream2_subhead.gif" ALT="Do What You Want To Do...">
<BR> 
Kemper estimates that the typical retiree needs at least 75 percent of
his or her pre-retirement income to live comfortably. Some expenses -
such as those related to transportation or clothes for work - decline at
retirement. But health care and certain other expenses tend to rise.  
<BR><BR>

It's been said that in retirement, time no longer equals money. That can
be good and bad. The "spending" of time can be directed on what may not
have been possible to do before - line dancing at a country western
club, whiling away hours in a fine art gallery or serving a church. 
<BR><BR>

Yet many retirees become nervous at the thought that instead of devoting
the majority of their time to an income-generating occupation, they are
doing nothing but consuming. Retirees are acutely aware that everything
has a price, and that their spending depletes the assets they worked
years to build.  
<BR><BR>

<IMG SRC="gifs/price_retdream3_subhead.gif" ALT="Worry Less.">
<BR> 

To enjoy the freedom that you have at retirement, your financial assets
must continue to work for you after you've stopped working.  
<BR><BR>

The biggest threat to your doing what you want to do and going where you
want to go - and the source of many retirees' financial problems - is
the effect of inflation on the financial resources you accumulate by
retirement age. Inflation raises the specter that what you accumulate
may not be sufficient over the long term. 
<BR><BR>

At least one retiree expense is especially inflationary. At a time when
the annual inflation rate has been averaging 3.5 percent, prescriptions
and medical care in general has increased by 15 percent to 20 percent
per year, according to the <I>Older Americans Almanac.</I> 
<BR><BR>

Both retirees and people not yet retired need to take proactive steps to
account for inflation. Your success in planning a worry-free retirement,
in fact, can turn on an investment program that anticipates inflation's
effect on your future purchasing power and standard of living. Beating
inflation is your best bet for realizing your retirement dream.

<IMG SRC="gifs/sav_acct_chart.gif">

<BR><BR>

As an economist, I am alarmed by the results of the recent Kemper-Roper
Retirement Monitor, a survey conducted to report on American attitudes
and expectations regarding retirement. Specifically, the finding that a
regular savings account was the most popular individual investment
(after the company-sponsored 401(k)) for retirement - across all age
groups - is very sad. 
<BR><BR>

When you consider the language that Americans use when talking about
retirement, this should not be surprising. When we talk about planning,
for example, we talk about "saving" for retirement. We don't often hear
about investing for retirement. It's a "nest egg" that we try to build,
not an income-generating machine. 
<BR><BR>

Why is this sad? I wonder how many people who are "saving" for
retirement today are considering the risk they're taking that their
savings account will tragically fail to provide for the length and
quality of the retirement they can expect - not to mention expensive
health care. While the principal and interest of a savings account is
generally insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the
risk is that the retiree will outlive his or her income from it. 
<BR><BR>

These survey results demonstrate that Americans clearly want safety for
their retirement funds. We are not about to overlook the potential for
default, which was a lesson learned well from the 1930s Depression era.
Yet there is another lesson that history can teach us - and it is that
inflation has the potential to erode the real value of our retirement
funds. In the 1970s, returns on savings accounts failed to keep up with
inflation. In the 1980s, savings accounts failed to keep up with
economic growth. It is precisely because rates paid on savings accounts
are not pegged to economic growth or inflation that they fail to keep up
with either. 
<BR><BR>

By contrast, other investments have historically provided returns above
the rate of inflation. 
<BR><BR>

For appropriate investment guidelines today, we need to look forward not
backward. In the past, Social Security benefits made up the shortfall
between desired income needs and the returns provided by regular savings
accounts. That won't continue, as reduced real benefit levels and higher
taxes are the future for Social Security. 
<BR><BR>

Perceptions of risk and required return drive retirement planning. The
popularity of savings accounts as a retirement vehicle suggests that
Americans have a high aversion to risk for their retirement funds but a
very low estimated need for a return. In a world of 3 percent or more
inflation and federal budget cutbacks on Social Security and Medicare,
Americans should recognize that reliance on regular savings accounts is
not a strategy without a risk of its own.

ALT="Small Businesses To Benefit From Pension Law Changes">
<BR CLEAR=ALL> 

With the new pension law changes, small businesses are expected
to be among the biggest winners.  In fact, according to estimates
by the <A HREF="http://www.dol.gov">U.S. Department of Labor</A> 
and the Profit Sharing/401(k)
Council of America, at least 10 million workers could benefit
from the changes in the pension laws.
<P>
One of the most critical pieces of the legislation includes a
new savings plan option called SIMPLE (Savings Incentive Match
Plan for Employees).  With SIMPLE, employers of 100 or fewer employees
would be able to set up a plan using a one-page form.  In addition,
the cumbersome task of conducting nondiscrimination testing will
no longer be required, making it even easier to set up a plan.
 
<P>
SIMPLE contributions will be immediately vested and fully portable,
making it easier for employers to accept plan rollovers.  Employers
must contribute 3 percent of pay for participating employees or
2 percent of pay for all employees earning at least $5,000, whether
or not they participate.  Under a special rule, the match could
be reduced (but not below 1 percent) in not more than two out
of any five years.  As incentive to keep participants in the plan,
the distribution penalty tax is increased to 25 percent under
SIMPLE and applies to distributions made within the first two
years the employee first participates in the plan.
<P>
The new laws now allow tax-exempt organizations, other than state
and local governments, to offer 401(k) plans to their workers.
 Further changes include the repeal of the family aggregation
law, which will now enable relatives who work in a family business
to earn their own retirement benefits without undue restrictions.
<P>
Consult your tax or legal advisor for a better understanding of
the new legislation and how it may impact your business. If you

ALT="Help Protect Your Company's Retirement Plan From Claims">
<BR CLEAR=ALL> 
A decision by the Supreme Court this past March (<I>Varity Corp.
v. Howe</I>) ruled that plan beneficiaries may sue on their own
behalf for breaches of fiduciary duty under ERISA.  This was allowed
even though ERISA had historically prohibited participants from
bringing suit on their own behalf.  The decision concluded that
ERISA Sec. 502(a)(3) was intended to be a general &quot;catch-all&quot;
that would protect plan participants and beneficiaries, by allowing
participants to bring claims on their own behalf, as well as on
the behalf of the plan itself, in the case of an employer's alleged
misrepresentation and breach of fiduciary duty.
<P>
Now some employers fear that they could be more vulnerable to
litigation.  Although more suits may indeed be filed as a result
of the Supreme Court ruling, you may help protect your interests
through proper plan communication and documentation.
<P>
<I><B>Comprehensive written documents</B></I>
<BR>
All of your company's benefits plans should be in writing. The
company's right to make changes to the plan should be clearly
spelled out in plan documentation. 
<P>
<I><B>Oral communication</B></I>
<BR>
Any communication about the plan, written or oral, could be used
in litigation.  Therefore, consider limiting the number of approved
plan spokespersons and refrain from oral statements about the
plan as much as possible.  A centralized benefits plan department
can help control the flow of information and make it less likely
that inappropriate information is communicated.
<P>
With proper plan disclosure you may be able to limit your company's
risk.  Consult your financial or tax advisor to ensure that your
plan's documentation is appropriate. If you know his or her e-mail
address, <A HREF="mailto:">

ALT="The DOL Pushes For Better Investment Education">
<BR CLEAR=ALL> 

Workers are increasingly finding themselves responsible for the
investment management of their retirement savings.  The reason?
 The growing popularity of participant-directed individual account
retirement plans, such as 401(k) plans. An advantage of these
plans is that they remove the burden of investment allocation
from employers.  In return, workers hold ultimate control over
their accounts and are oftentimes given more flexibility in their
investment options.
<P>
Although such plans are generally viewed as positive, the 
<A HREF="http://www.dol.gov">U.S. Department of Labor 
(DOL)</A> has become concerned.  The DOL fears
that participants may not understand investment principles well
enough to make informed decisions that will ensure an adequate
retirement income.  In addition, the responsibility of choosing
investments may frighten workers who do not understand investment
principles, thus deterring them from plan participation.
<P>
To combat these drawbacks, many employers and plan sponsors have
provided workers with basic investment education programs.  Many
others, however, have held back.  They fear that their investment
education may be construed as offering &quot;investment advice&quot;
under section 3 (21) (A) (ii) of ERISA, which could give rise
to fiduciary status and potential liabilities.  
<P>
In an effort to promote better investment education by employers,
the DOL recently published <A HREF="http://www.benefitslink.com/erisaregs/96-1.html">
<I>Interpretive Bulletin 96-1</I></A>.
 The bulletin clarifies the differences between investment education
and investment advice. It also identifies four categories of investment
education, which are summarized below.
<P>
<I><B>1) Plan Information</B></I>
<BR>
Any materials that explain the operation of the plan, its investment
alternatives, the benefits of enrolling, the advantages of increasing
contributions and how preretirement withdrawals may lessen retirement
income.
<P>
<I><B>2) General Financial and Investment Information</B></I>
<BR>
Information that explains such topics as risk and return, diversification,
dollar cost averaging, compounded return, tax deferred investment,
effects of inflation, determining time horizons, and other similar
financial and investment concepts.
<P>
<I><B>3) Asset Allocation Models</B></I> 
<BR>
Materials that illustrate different portfolio asset allocations
based on various time horizons and risk profiles and are based
on generally accepted investment theories and principles.
<P>
<I><B>4)  Interactive Investment Materials</B></I> 
<BR>
Worksheets, software and similar materials, which provide a participant
the means to estimate future retirement income needs and assess
the impact of different asset allocations on retirement income.
<P>
Ongoing investment education can play a crucial role in helping
your workers understand what it takes to invest successfully.
 A better understanding by employees may also expand your plan's
participation and contribution rates.  As always, contact your
financial or legal advisor if you have questions about your company's
investment education programs.  If you know his or her e-mail
address, <A HREF="mailto:">send an e-mail now</A>.

</FONT SIZE=-1>

<P>

For more complete information on any Kemper Fund, including management
fees and expenses, please request a free prospectus from your
financial representative, Kemper Shareholder Services (1-800-621-1048), 
<A HREF="../prospectus_email.html">
e-mail us your request</A> for a prospectus through the mail or 
<A HREF="../prospectus_download.html">
download a prospectus.</A>

<P>

Read the prospectus carefully before you invest or send money. Remember
that there is no assurance that the objective of any mutual fund will
be achieved and mutual fund returns and net asset value fluctuate.
Shares are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or
less than their original cost. Money market funds seek to maintain a
net asset value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that
they will. Mutual fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. 
government. 

<P>

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<B>Performance And Yield Notes</B>
<BR>
Returns are historical and do not represent future performance. Returns
and net asset values fluctuate. Shares
are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or less
than the original cost. Kemper Money Funds seek to maintain a net asset
value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that they will.
Fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. government.
<P>

Average annual total return and total return measure net investment
income and capital gain or loss from portfolio investments, assuming reinvestment
of dividends and, for average annual total return only, adjustments for the maximum
sales charge or the contingent deferred sales charge in effect at the end of the periods,
as applicable.  Average annual
total return reflects annualized change while total return reflects
aggregate change. During the periods noted, securities prices
fluctuated. For each money market fund, the current annualized yield is
the seven day annualized net investment income per share as of the
indicated date. Gains or losses are not included. Effective yield
reflects compounding of income.
<P>

<B>Special Risks</B>
<BR>
Investment by certain portfolios in lower rated and non-rated securities
presents a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher
rated securities (principally Kemper Diversified Income Fund and Kemper
High Yield Fund). For portfolios that invest internationally
(principally Kemper International Fund, Kemper Global Income Fund, Kemper
Europe Fund, Kemper Diversified Income Fund, Kemper Asian Growth Fund
and Kemper Worldwide 2004 Fund), there
are special risk considerations, including foreign exchange rates,
foreign government regulations and differing degrees of liquidity that
may adversely affect portfolio securities, all of which are more fully
discussed in the funds' prospectuses. 
Investment in smaller companies (Kemper Small Capitalization Equity Fund
and Kemper-Dreman Small Cap Value Fund) presents greater risk of loss
than investment in large companies. Concentration in certain market
sectors (Kemper-Dreman High Return Fund) presents special risk
considerations.
<P>

Performance of funds may be compared to the performance of various
unmanaged indices including, but not limited to: the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index and the Dow
Jones Industrial Average, which are generally representative of the U.S.
stock market; the Wilshire Large Company Growth Index, which is
generally representative of the market for stocks of larger growth
companies (selected on the basis of sales growth, return on equity and
dividend payout); the Lehman Brothers Government/Corporate Bond index,
which is generally representative of intermediate and long-term
government and investment grade corporate debt securities; the Morgan
Stanley Capital International EAFE, which is generally representative of
international markets; the FT/S&amp;P - Actuaries World Index - Europe, which 
is generally representative of the equity securities of European companies; the Consumer Price Index, generally
representative of the level of inflation; the Salomon Brothers World
Government Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index on a U.S. dollar total return basis with all dividends reinvested and is comprised of government bonds from 14 countries; the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index generally representative of intermediate-term government 
bonds, investment grade corporate debt securities and mortgage-backed
securities; the Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index, which includes
approximately 15,000 bonds; the Russell 1000 Growth Index, which is an 
unmanaged index comprised of common stocks of larger U.S. companies with 
greater than average growth orientation and represents the universe of
stocks from which "earnings/growth" money managers typically select; and the
Russell 2000 index, which is an unmanaged capitalization weighted price only 
index which is comprised of 2000 of the smallest stocks in the Russell
3000 index. The performance of funds may also be compared to the combined performance of several indices.
<P>

Returns for Kemper Asian Growth Fund, Kemper Value+Growth Fund, Kemper-Dreman Funds and Kemper Europe Fund include the effect of a temporary waiver of
management fees and/or an absorption of certain operating expenses by Zurich 
Kemper Investments, Inc., as investment advisor, for periods
specified in the prospectus, which improved results. The absorption and
waiver for certain Kemper State Tax-Free Income Funds has been reinstated. Income from
tax-exempt funds may be subject to state and local taxes except as
otherwise provided in the prospectus, and a portion of income may be
subject to the alternative minimum tax for certain investors.

<BR><BR>
<P>

For more complete information on any Kemper Fund, including management
fees and expenses, please request a free prospectus from your
financial representative, Kemper Shareholder Services (1-800-621-1048), 
<A HREF="../prospectus_email.html">
e-mail us your request</A> for a prospectus through the mail or 
<A HREF="../prospectus_download.html">
download a prospectus.</A>
<P>

Read the prospectus carefully before you invest or send money. Remember
that there is no assurance that the objective of any mutual fund will
be achieved and mutual fund returns and net asset value fluctuate.
Shares are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or
less than their original cost. Money market funds seek to maintain a
net asset value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that
they will. Mutual fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. 
government. 
<P>

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<B>Performance And Yield Notes</B>
<BR>
Returns are historical and do not represent future performance. Returns
and net asset values fluctuate. Shares
are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or less
than the original cost. Kemper Money Funds seek to maintain a net asset
value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that they will.
Fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. government.
<P>

Average annual total return and total return measure net investment
income and capital gain or loss from portfolio investments, assuming reinvestment
of dividends and, for average annual total return only, adjustments for the maximum
sales charge or the contingent deferred sales charge in effect at the end of the periods,
as applicable.  Average annual
total return reflects annualized change while total return reflects
aggregate change. During the periods noted, securities prices
fluctuated. For each money market fund, the current annualized yield is
the seven day annualized net investment income per share as of the
indicated date. Gains or losses are not included. Effective yield
reflects compounding of income.
<P>

<B>Special Risks</B>
<BR>
Investment by certain portfolios in lower rated and non-rated securities
presents a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher
rated securities (principally Kemper Diversified Income Fund and Kemper
High Yield Fund). For portfolios that invest internationally
(principally Kemper International Fund, Kemper Global Income Fund, Kemper
Europe Fund, Kemper Diversified Income Fund, Kemper Asian Growth Fund
and Kemper Worldwide 2004 Fund), there
are special risk considerations, including foreign exchange rates,
foreign government regulations and differing degrees of liquidity that
may adversely affect portfolio securities, all of which are more fully
discussed in the funds' prospectuses. 
Investment in smaller companies (Kemper Small Capitalization Equity Fund
and Kemper-Dreman Small Cap Value Fund) presents greater risk of loss
than investment in large companies. Concentration in certain market
sectors (Kemper-Dreman High Return Fund) presents special risk
considerations.
<P>

Performance of funds may be compared to the performance of various
unmanaged indices including, but not limited to: the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index and the Dow
Jones Industrial Average, which are generally representative of the U.S.
stock market; the Wilshire Large Company Growth Index, which is
generally representative of the market for stocks of larger growth
companies (selected on the basis of sales growth, return on equity and
dividend payout); the Lehman Brothers Government/Corporate Bond index,
which is generally representative of intermediate and long-term
government and investment grade corporate debt securities; the Morgan
Stanley Capital International EAFE, which is generally representative of
international markets; the FT/S&amp;P - Actuaries World Index - Europe, which 
is generally representative of the equity securities of European companies; the Consumer Price Index, generally
representative of the level of inflation; the Salomon Brothers World
Government Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index on a U.S. dollar total return basis with all dividends reinvested and is comprised of government bonds from 14 countries; the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index generally representative of intermediate-term government 
bonds, investment grade corporate debt securities and mortgage-backed
securities; the Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index, which includes
approximately 15,000 bonds; the Russell 1000 Growth Index, which is an 
unmanaged index comprised of common stocks of larger U.S. companies with 
greater than average growth orientation and represents the universe of
stocks from which "earnings/growth" money managers typically select; and the
Russell 2000 index, which is an unmanaged capitalization weighted price only 
index which is comprised of 2000 of the smallest stocks in the Russell
3000 index. The performance of funds may also be compared to the combined performance of several indices.
<P>

Returns for Kemper Asian Growth Fund, Kemper Value+Growth Fund, Kemper-Dreman Funds and Kemper Europe Fund include the effect of a temporary waiver of
management fees and/or an absorption of certain operating expenses by Zurich 
Kemper Investments, Inc., as investment advisor, for periods
specified in the prospectus, which improved results. The absorption and
waiver for certain Kemper State Tax-Free Income Funds has been reinstated. Income from
tax-exempt funds may be subject to state and local taxes except as
otherwise provided in the prospectus, and a portion of income may be
subject to the alternative minimum tax for certain investors.

<P>

For more complete information on any Kemper Fund, including management
fees and expenses, please request a free prospectus from your
financial representative, Kemper Shareholder Services (1-800-621-1048), 
<A HREF="../prospectus_email.html">
e-mail us your request</A> for a prospectus through the mail or 
<A HREF="../prospectus_download.html">
download a prospectus.</A>
<P>

Read the prospectus carefully before you invest or send money. Remember
that there is no assurance that the objective of any mutual fund will
be achieved and mutual fund returns and net asset value fluctuate.
Shares are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or
less than their original cost. Money market funds seek to maintain a
net asset value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that
they will. Mutual fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. 
government. 
<P>

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<B>Performance And Yield Notes</B>
<BR>
Returns are historical and do not represent future performance. Returns
and net asset values fluctuate. Shares
are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or less
than the original cost. Kemper Money Funds seek to maintain a net asset
value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that they will.
Fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. government.
<P>

Average annual total return and total return measure net investment
income and capital gain or loss from portfolio investments, assuming reinvestment
of dividends and, for average annual total return only, adjustments for the maximum
sales charge or the contingent deferred sales charge in effect at the end of the periods,
as applicable.  Average annual
total return reflects annualized change while total return reflects
aggregate change. During the periods noted, securities prices
fluctuated. For each money market fund, the current annualized yield is
the seven day annualized net investment income per share as of the
indicated date. Gains or losses are not included. Effective yield
reflects compounding of income.
<P>

<B>Special Risks</B>
<BR>
Investment by certain portfolios in lower rated and non-rated securities
presents a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher
rated securities (principally Kemper Diversified Income Fund and Kemper
High Yield Fund). For portfolios that invest internationally
(principally Kemper International Fund, Kemper Global Income Fund, Kemper
Europe Fund, Kemper Diversified Income Fund, Kemper Asian Growth Fund
and Kemper Worldwide 2004 Fund), there
are special risk considerations, including foreign exchange rates,
foreign government regulations and differing degrees of liquidity that
may adversely affect portfolio securities, all of which are more fully
discussed in the funds' prospectuses. 
Investment in smaller companies (Kemper Small Capitalization Equity Fund
and Kemper-Dreman Small Cap Value Fund) presents greater risk of loss
than investment in large companies. Concentration in certain market
sectors (Kemper-Dreman High Return Fund) presents special risk
considerations.
<P>

Performance of funds may be compared to the performance of various
unmanaged indices including, but not limited to: the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index and the Dow
Jones Industrial Average, which are generally representative of the U.S.
stock market; the Wilshire Large Company Growth Index, which is
generally representative of the market for stocks of larger growth
companies (selected on the basis of sales growth, return on equity and
dividend payout); the Lehman Brothers Government/Corporate Bond index,
which is generally representative of intermediate and long-term
government and investment grade corporate debt securities; the Morgan
Stanley Capital International EAFE, which is generally representative of
international markets; the FT/S&amp;P - Actuaries World Index - Europe, which 
is generally representative of the equity securities of European companies; the Consumer Price Index, generally
representative of the level of inflation; the Salomon Brothers World
Government Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index on a U.S. dollar total return basis with all dividends reinvested and is comprised of government bonds from 14 countries; the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index generally representative of intermediate-term government 
bonds, investment grade corporate debt securities and mortgage-backed
securities; the Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index, which includes
approximately 15,000 bonds; the Russell 1000 Growth Index, which is an 
unmanaged index comprised of common stocks of larger U.S. companies with 
greater than average growth orientation and represents the universe of
stocks from which "earnings/growth" money managers typically select; and the
Russell 2000 index, which is an unmanaged capitalization weighted price only 
index which is comprised of 2000 of the smallest stocks in the Russell
3000 index. The performance of funds may also be compared to the combined performance of several indices.
<P>

Returns for Kemper Asian Growth Fund, Kemper Value+Growth Fund, Kemper-Dreman Funds and Kemper Europe Fund include the effect of a temporary waiver of
management fees and/or an absorption of certain operating expenses by Zurich 
Kemper Investments, Inc., as investment advisor, for periods
specified in the prospectus, which improved results. The absorption and
waiver for certain Kemper State Tax-Free Income Funds has been reinstated. Income from
tax-exempt funds may be subject to state and local taxes except as
otherwise provided in the prospectus, and a portion of income may be
subject to the alternative minimum tax for certain investors.

These figures are adjusted for maximum sales charge (Class A) or the
contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC) in effect at the end of the
specified period (Class B). The maximum initial sales charge (Class A)
is 5.75% for Kemper Small Capitalization Equity Fund. The CDSC schedule 
for Class B shares for years 1 to 6 is 4%, 3%, 3%, 2%, 2% and 1%. 
Adjustment for a full annual period is at CDSC for the next annual level. 
Thus, 1-year returns are adjusted for 3% CDSC. Sales charges are reduced 
or eliminated under certain conditions as described in the funds' prospectuses.

fees and expenses, please request a free prospectus from your

<P>

Read the prospectus carefully before you invest or send money. Remember
that there is no assurance that the objective of any mutual fund will
be achieved and mutual fund returns and net asset value fluctuate.
Shares are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or
less than their original cost. Money market funds seek to maintain a
net asset value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that
they will. Mutual fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. 
government. 

<P>

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<B>Performance And Yield Notes</B>
<BR>
Returns are historical and do not represent future performance. Returns
and net asset values fluctuate. Shares
are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or less
than the original cost. Kemper Money Funds seek to maintain a net asset
value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that they will.
Fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. government.
<P>

Average annual total return and total return measure net investment
income and capital gain or loss from portfolio investments, assuming reinvestment
of dividends and, for average annual total return only, adjustments for the maximum
sales charge or the contingent deferred sales charge in effect at the end of the periods,
as applicable.  Average annual
total return reflects annualized change while total return reflects
aggregate change. During the periods noted, securities prices
fluctuated. For each money market fund, the current annualized yield is
the seven day annualized net investment income per share as of the
indicated date. Gains or losses are not included. Effective yield
reflects compounding of income.
<P>

<B>Special Risks</B>
<BR>
Investment by certain portfolios in lower rated and non-rated securities
presents a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher
rated securities (principally Kemper Diversified Income Fund and Kemper
High Yield Fund). For portfolios that invest internationally
(principally Kemper International Fund, Kemper Global Income Fund, Kemper
Europe Fund, Kemper Diversified Income Fund, Kemper Asian Growth Fund
and Kemper Worldwide 2004 Fund), there
are special risk considerations, including foreign exchange rates,
foreign government regulations and differing degrees of liquidity that
may adversely affect portfolio securities, all of which are more fully
discussed in the funds' prospectuses. 
Investment in smaller companies (Kemper Small Capitalization Equity Fund
and Kemper-Dreman Small Cap Value Fund) presents greater risk of loss
than investment in large companies. Concentration in certain market
sectors (Kemper-Dreman High Return Fund) presents special risk
considerations.
<P>

Performance of funds may be compared to the performance of various
unmanaged indices including, but not limited to: the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index and the Dow
Jones Industrial Average, which are generally representative of the U.S.
stock market; the Wilshire Large Company Growth Index, which is
generally representative of the market for stocks of larger growth
companies (selected on the basis of sales growth, return on equity and
dividend payout); the Lehman Brothers Government/Corporate Bond index,
which is generally representative of intermediate and long-term
government and investment grade corporate debt securities; the Morgan
Stanley Capital International EAFE, which is generally representative of
international markets; the FT/S&amp;P - Actuaries World Index - Europe, which 
is generally representative of the equity securities of European companies; the Consumer Price Index, generally
representative of the level of inflation; the Salomon Brothers World
Government Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index on a U.S. dollar total return basis with all dividends reinvested and is comprised of government bonds from 14 countries; the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index generally representative of intermediate-term government 
bonds, investment grade corporate debt securities and mortgage-backed
securities; the Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index, which includes
approximately 15,000 bonds; the Russell 1000 Growth Index, which is an 
unmanaged index comprised of common stocks of larger U.S. companies with 
greater than average growth orientation and represents the universe of
stocks from which "earnings/growth" money managers typically select; and the
Russell 2000 index, which is an unmanaged capitalization weighted price only 
index which is comprised of 2000 of the smallest stocks in the Russell
3000 index. The performance of funds may also be compared to the combined performance of several indices.
<P>

Returns for Kemper Asian Growth Fund, Kemper Value+Growth Fund, Kemper-Dreman Funds and Kemper Europe Fund include the effect of a temporary waiver of
management fees and/or an absorption of certain operating expenses by Zurich 
Kemper Investments, Inc., as investment advisor, for periods
specified in the prospectus, which improved results. The absorption and
waiver for certain Kemper State Tax-Free Income Funds has been reinstated. Income from
tax-exempt funds may be subject to state and local taxes except as
otherwise provided in the prospectus, and a portion of income may be
subject to the alternative minimum tax for certain investors.

fluctuated. For each money market fund, the current annualized yield is
the seven day annualized net investment income per share as of the
indicated date. Gains or losses are not included. Effective yield
reflects compounding of income.
<P>

<B>Special Risks</B>
<BR>
Investment by certain portfolios in lower rated and non-rated securities
presents a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher
rated securities (principally Kemper Diversified Income Fund and Kemper
High Yield Fund). For portfolios that invest internationally
(principally Kemper International Fund, Kemper Global Income Fund, Kemper
Europe Fund, Kemper Diversified Income Fund, Kemper Asian Growth Fund
and Kemper Worldwide 2004 Fund), there
are special risk considerations, including foreign exchange rates,
foreign government regulations and differing degrees of liquidity that
may adversely affect portfolio securities, all of which are more fully
discussed in the funds' prospectuses. 
Investment in smaller companies (Kemper Small Capitalization Equity Fund
and Kemper-Dreman Small Cap Value Fund) presents greater risk of loss
than investment in large companies. Concentration in certain market
sectors (Kemper-Dreman High Return Fund) presents special risk
considerations.
<P>

Performance of funds may be compared to the performance of various
unmanaged indices including, but not limited to: the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index and the Dow
Jones Industrial Average, which are generally representative of the U.S.
stock market; the Wilshire Large Company Growth Index, which is
generally representative of the market for stocks of larger growth
companies (selected on the basis of sales growth, return on equity and
dividend payout); the Lehman Brothers Government/Corporate Bond index,
which is generally representative of intermediate and long-term
government and investment grade corporate debt securities; the Morgan
Stanley Capital International EAFE, which is generally representative of
international markets; the FT/S&amp;P - Actuaries World Index - Europe, which 
is generally representative of the equity securities of European companies; the Consumer Price Index, generally
representative of the level of inflation; the Salomon Brothers World
Government Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index on a U.S. dollar total return basis with all dividends reinvested and is comprised of government bonds from 14 countries; the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index generally representative of intermediate-term government 
bonds, investment grade corporate debt securities and mortgage-backed
securities; the Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index, which includes
approximately 15,000 bonds; the Russell 1000 Growth Index, which is an 
unmanaged index comprised of common stocks of larger U.S. companies with 
greater than average growth orientation and represents the universe of
stocks from which "earnings/growth" money managers typically select; and the
Russell 2000 index, which is an unmanaged capitalization weighted price only 
index which is comprised of 2000 of the smallest stocks in the Russell
3000 index. The performance of funds may also be compared to the combined performance of several indices.
<P>

Returns for Kemper Asian Growth Fund, Kemper Value+Growth Fund, Kemper-Dreman Funds and Kemper Europe Fund include the effect of a temporary waiver of
management fees and/or an absorption of certain operating expenses by Zurich 
Kemper Investments, Inc., as investment advisor, for periods
specified in the prospectus, which improved results. The absorption and
waiver for certain Kemper State Tax-Free Income Funds has been reinstated. Income from
tax-exempt funds may be subject to state and local taxes except as
otherwise provided in the prospectus, and a portion of income may be
subject to the alternative minimum tax for certain investors.

## These figures are adjusted for maximum
sales charge (Class A) or the contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC) in
effect at the end of the specified period (Class B). The maximum initial
sales charge (Class A) is 5.75% for Kemper Asian Growth Fund. The CDSC schedule
for Class B shares for years 1 to 6 is 4%, 3%, 3%, 2%, 2% and 1%.
Adjustment for a full annual period is at CDSC for the next annual level.
Thus, 1-year returns are adjusted for 3% CDSC. Sales charges are reduced
or eliminated under certain conditions as described in the funds'
prospectuses.

<P>

Read the prospectus carefully before you invest or send money. Remember
that there is no assurance that the objective of any mutual fund will
be achieved and mutual fund returns and net asset value fluctuate.
Shares are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or
less than their original cost. Money market funds seek to maintain a
net asset value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that
they will. Mutual fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. 
government.

<B>Performance And Yield Notes</B>
<BR>
Returns are historical and do not represent future performance. Returns
and net asset values fluctuate. Shares
are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or less
than the original cost. Kemper Money Funds seek to maintain a net asset
value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that they will.
Fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. government.
<P>

Average annual total return and total return measure net investment
income and capital gain or loss from portfolio investments, assuming reinvestment
of dividends and, for average annual total return only, adjustments for the maximum
sales charge or the contingent deferred sales charge in effect at the end of the periods,
as applicable.  Average annual
total return reflects annualized change while total return reflects
aggregate change. During the periods noted, securities prices
fluctuated. For each money market fund, the current annualized yield is
the seven day annualized net investment income per share as of the
indicated date. Gains or losses are not included. Effective yield
reflects compounding of income.
<P>

<B>Special Risks</B>
<BR>
Investment by certain portfolios in lower rated and non-rated securities
presents a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher
rated securities (principally Kemper Diversified Income Fund and Kemper
High Yield Fund). For portfolios that invest internationally
(principally Kemper International Fund, Kemper Global Income Fund, Kemper
Europe Fund, Kemper Diversified Income Fund, Kemper Asian Growth Fund
and Kemper Worldwide 2004 Fund), there
are special risk considerations, including foreign exchange rates,
foreign government regulations and differing degrees of liquidity that
may adversely affect portfolio securities, all of which are more fully
discussed in the funds' prospectuses. 
Investment in smaller companies (Kemper Small Capitalization Equity Fund
and Kemper-Dreman Small Cap Value Fund) presents greater risk of loss
than investment in large companies. Concentration in certain market
sectors (Kemper-Dreman High Return Fund) presents special risk
considerations.
<P>

Performance of funds may be compared to the performance of various
unmanaged indices including, but not limited to: the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index and the Dow
Jones Industrial Average, which are generally representative of the U.S.
stock market; the Wilshire Large Company Growth Index, which is
generally representative of the market for stocks of larger growth
companies (selected on the basis of sales growth, return on equity and
dividend payout); the Lehman Brothers Government/Corporate Bond index,
which is generally representative of intermediate and long-term
government and investment grade corporate debt securities; the Morgan
Stanley Capital International EAFE, which is generally representative of

sales charge (Class A) is 5.75% for Kemper Europe Fund. The CDSC schedule
for Class B shares for years 1 to 6 is 4%, 3%, 3%, 2%, 2% and 1%.
Adjustment for a full annual period is at CDSC for the next annual level.
Thus, 1-year returns are adjusted for 3% CDSC. Sales charges are reduced
or eliminated under certain conditions as described in the funds'
prospectuses.

Read the prospectus carefully before you invest or send money. Remember
that there is no assurance that the objective of any mutual fund will
be achieved and mutual fund returns and net asset value fluctuate.
Shares are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or
less than their original cost. Money market funds seek to maintain a
net asset value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that
they will. Mutual fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S.

<B>Performance And Yield Notes</B>
<BR>
Returns are historical and do not represent future performance. Returns
and net asset values fluctuate. Shares
are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or less
than the original cost. Kemper Money Funds seek to maintain a net asset
value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that they will.
Fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. government.
<P>

Average annual total return and total return measure net investment
income and capital gain or loss from portfolio investments, assuming reinvestment
of dividends and, for average annual total return only, adjustments for the maximum
sales charge or the contingent deferred sales charge in effect at the end of the periods,
as applicable.  Average annual
total return reflects annualized change while total return reflects
aggregate change. During the periods noted, securities prices
fluctuated. For each money market fund, the current annualized yield is
the seven day annualized net investment income per share as of the
indicated date. Gains or losses are not included. Effective yield
reflects compounding of income.
<P>

<B>Special Risks</B>
<BR>
Investment by certain portfolios in lower rated and non-rated securities
presents a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher
rated securities (principally Kemper Diversified Income Fund and Kemper
High Yield Fund). For portfolios that invest internationally
(principally Kemper International Fund, Kemper Global Income Fund, Kemper
Europe Fund, Kemper Diversified Income Fund, Kemper Asian Growth Fund
and Kemper Worldwide 2004 Fund), there
are special risk considerations, including foreign exchange rates,
foreign government regulations and differing degrees of liquidity that
may adversely affect portfolio securities, all of which are more fully
discussed in the funds' prospectuses. 
Investment in smaller companies (Kemper Small Capitalization Equity Fund
and Kemper-Dreman Small Cap Value Fund) presents greater risk of loss
than investment in large companies. Concentration in certain market
sectors (Kemper-Dreman High Return Fund) presents special risk
considerations.
<P>

Performance of funds may be compared to the performance of various
unmanaged indices including, but not limited to: the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index and the Dow
Jones Industrial Average, which are generally representative of the U.S.
stock market; the Wilshire Large Company Growth Index, which is
generally representative of the market for stocks of larger growth
companies (selected on the basis of sales growth, return on equity and
dividend payout); the Lehman Brothers Government/Corporate Bond index,
which is generally representative of intermediate and long-term
government and investment grade corporate debt securities; the Morgan
Stanley Capital International EAFE, which is generally representative of
international markets; the FT/S&amp;P - Actuaries World Index - Europe, which 
is generally representative of the equity securities of European companies; the Consumer Price Index, generally
representative of the level of inflation; the Salomon Brothers World
Government Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index on a U.S. dollar total return basis with all dividends reinvested and is comprised of government bonds from 14 countries; the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index generally representative of intermediate-term government 
bonds, investment grade corporate debt securities and mortgage-backed
securities; the Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index, which includes
approximately 15,000 bonds; the Russell 1000 Growth Index, which is an 
unmanaged index comprised of common stocks of larger U.S. companies with 
greater than average growth orientation and represents the universe of
stocks from which "earnings/growth" money managers typically select; and the
Russell 2000 index, which is an unmanaged capitalization weighted price only 
index which is comprised of 2000 of the smallest stocks in the Russell
3000 index. The performance of funds may also be compared to the combined performance of several indices.
<P>

Returns for Kemper Asian Growth Fund, Kemper Value+Growth Fund, Kemper-Dreman Funds and Kemper Europe Fund include the effect of a temporary waiver of
management fees and/or an absorption of certain operating expenses by Zurich 
Kemper Investments, Inc., as investment advisor, for periods
specified in the prospectus, which improved results. The absorption and
waiver for certain Kemper State Tax-Free Income Funds has been reinstated. Income from
tax-exempt funds may be subject to state and local taxes except as
otherwise provided in the prospectus, and a portion of income may be
subject to the alternative minimum tax for certain investors.

## These figures are adjusted for maximum sales charge (Class A) or the
contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC) in effect at the end of the
specified period (Class B). The maximum initial sales charge (Class A)
is 5.75% for Kemper Quantitative Equity Fund. The CDSC schedule

Adjustment for a full annual period is at CDSC for the next annual level. 
Thus, 1-year returns are adjusted for 3% CDSC. For Class C shares, performance is adjusted for the 1% CDSC for shares redeemed within one year. Sales charges are

These figures are adjusted for maximum sales charge (Class A) or the
contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC) in effect at the end of the
specified period (Class B). The maximum initial sales charge (Class A)
is 5.75% for Kemper Value+Growth Fund. The CDSC schedule for Class B shares for
years 1 to 6 is 4%, 3%, 3%, 2%, 2% and 1%. Adjustment for a full annual
period is at CDSC for the next annual level. Thus, 1-year returns are
adjusted for 3% CDSC. For Class C shares, performance is adjusted for the 1% CDSC 
for shares redeemed within one year.  Sales charges are reduced or eliminated under
certain conditions as described in the funds' prospectuses.

<P>

Read the prospectus carefully before you invest or send money. Remember
that there is no assurance that the objective of any mutual fund will
be achieved and mutual fund returns and net asset value fluctuate.
Shares are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or
less than their original cost. Money market funds seek to maintain a
net asset value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that
they will. Mutual fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. 
government.

<B>Performance And Yield Notes</B>
<BR>
Returns are historical and do not represent future performance. Returns
and net asset values fluctuate. Shares
are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or less
than the original cost. Kemper Money Funds seek to maintain a net asset
value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that they will.
Fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. government.
<P>

Average annual total return and total return measure net investment
income and capital gain or loss from portfolio investments, assuming reinvestment
of dividends and, for average annual total return only, adjustments for the maximum
sales charge or the contingent deferred sales charge in effect at the end of the periods,
as applicable.  Average annual
total return reflects annualized change while total return reflects
aggregate change. During the periods noted, securities prices
fluctuated. For each money market fund, the current annualized yield is
the seven day annualized net investment income per share as of the
indicated date. Gains or losses are not included. Effective yield
reflects compounding of income.
<P>

<B>Special Risks</B>
<BR>
Investment by certain portfolios in lower rated and non-rated securities
presents a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher
rated securities (principally Kemper Diversified Income Fund and Kemper
High Yield Fund). For portfolios that invest internationally
(principally Kemper International Fund, Kemper Global Income Fund, Kemper
Europe Fund, Kemper Diversified Income Fund, Kemper Asian Growth Fund
and Kemper Worldwide 2004 Fund), there
are special risk considerations, including foreign exchange rates,
foreign government regulations and differing degrees of liquidity that
may adversely affect portfolio securities, all of which are more fully
discussed in the funds' prospectuses. 
Investment in smaller companies (Kemper Small Capitalization Equity Fund
and Kemper-Dreman Small Cap Value Fund) presents greater risk of loss
than investment in large companies. Concentration in certain market
sectors (Kemper-Dreman High Return Fund) presents special risk
considerations.
<P>

Performance of funds may be compared to the performance of various
unmanaged indices including, but not limited to: the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index and the Dow
Jones Industrial Average, which are generally representative of the U.S.
stock market; the Wilshire Large Company Growth Index, which is
generally representative of the market for stocks of larger growth
companies (selected on the basis of sales growth, return on equity and
dividend payout); the Lehman Brothers Government/Corporate Bond index,
which is generally representative of intermediate and long-term
government and investment grade corporate debt securities; the Morgan
Stanley Capital International EAFE, which is generally representative of
international markets; the FT/S&amp;P - Actuaries World Index - Europe, which 
is generally representative of the equity securities of European companies; the Consumer Price Index, generally
representative of the level of inflation; the Salomon Brothers World
Government Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index on a U.S. dollar total return basis with all dividends reinvested and is comprised of government bonds from 14 countries; the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index generally representative of intermediate-term government 
bonds, investment grade corporate debt securities and mortgage-backed
securities; the Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index, which includes
approximately 15,000 bonds; the Russell 1000 Growth Index, which is an 
unmanaged index comprised of common stocks of larger U.S. companies with 
greater than average growth orientation and represents the universe of
stocks from which "earnings/growth" money managers typically select; and the
Russell 2000 index, which is an unmanaged capitalization weighted price only 
index which is comprised of 2000 of the smallest stocks in the Russell
3000 index. The performance of funds may also be compared to the combined performance of several indices.
<P>

Returns for Kemper Asian Growth Fund, Kemper Value+Growth Fund, Kemper-Dreman Funds and Kemper Europe Fund include the effect of a temporary waiver of
management fees and/or an absorption of certain operating expenses by Zurich 
Kemper Investments, Inc., as investment advisor, for periods
specified in the prospectus, which improved results. The absorption and
waiver for certain Kemper State Tax-Free Income Funds has been reinstated. Income from
tax-exempt funds may be subject to state and local taxes except as
otherwise provided in the prospectus, and a portion of income may be
subject to the alternative minimum tax for certain investors.

These figures are adjusted for maximum sales charge (Class A) or the
contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC) in effect at the end of the
specified period (Class B). The maximum initial sales charge (Class A)
is 5.75% for Kemper Total Return Fund. The CDSC schedule for Class B shares for
years 1 to 6 is 4%, 3%, 3%, 2%, 2% and 1%. Adjustment for a full annual
period is at CDSC for the next annual level. Thus, 1-year returns are
adjusted for 3% CDSC. Sales charges are reduced or eliminated under
certain conditions as described in the funds' prospectuses.

Read the prospectus carefully before you invest or send money. Remember
that there is no assurance that the objective of any mutual fund will
be achieved and mutual fund returns and net asset value fluctuate.
Shares are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or
less than their original cost. Money market funds seek to maintain a
net asset value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that
they will. Mutual fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. 
government.

<B>Performance And Yield Notes</B>
<BR>
Returns are historical and do not represent future performance. Returns
and net asset values fluctuate. Shares
are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or less
than the original cost. Kemper Money Funds seek to maintain a net asset
value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that they will.
Fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. government.
<P>

Average annual total return and total return measure net investment
income and capital gain or loss from portfolio investments, assuming reinvestment
of dividends and, for average annual total return only, adjustments for the maximum
sales charge or the contingent deferred sales charge in effect at the end of the periods,
as applicable.  Average annual
total return reflects annualized change while total return reflects
aggregate change. During the periods noted, securities prices
fluctuated. For each money market fund, the current annualized yield is
the seven day annualized net investment income per share as of the
indicated date. Gains or losses are not included. Effective yield
reflects compounding of income.
<P>

<B>Special Risks</B>
<BR>
Investment by certain portfolios in lower rated and non-rated securities
presents a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher
rated securities (principally Kemper Diversified Income Fund and Kemper
High Yield Fund). For portfolios that invest internationally
(principally Kemper International Fund, Kemper Global Income Fund, Kemper
Europe Fund, Kemper Diversified Income Fund, Kemper Asian Growth Fund
and Kemper Worldwide 2004 Fund), there
are special risk considerations, including foreign exchange rates,
foreign government regulations and differing degrees of liquidity that
may adversely affect portfolio securities, all of which are more fully
discussed in the funds' prospectuses. 
Investment in smaller companies (Kemper Small Capitalization Equity Fund
and Kemper-Dreman Small Cap Value Fund) presents greater risk of loss
than investment in large companies. Concentration in certain market
sectors (Kemper-Dreman High Return Fund) presents special risk
considerations.
<P>

Performance of funds may be compared to the performance of various
unmanaged indices including, but not limited to: the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index and the Dow
Jones Industrial Average, which are generally representative of the U.S.
stock market; the Wilshire Large Company Growth Index, which is
generally representative of the market for stocks of larger growth
companies (selected on the basis of sales growth, return on equity and
dividend payout); the Lehman Brothers Government/Corporate Bond index,
which is generally representative of intermediate and long-term
government and investment grade corporate debt securities; the Morgan
Stanley Capital International EAFE, which is generally representative of
international markets; the FT/S&amp;P - Actuaries World Index - Europe, which 
is generally representative of the equity securities of European companies; the Consumer Price Index, generally
representative of the level of inflation; the Salomon Brothers World
Government Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index on a U.S. dollar total return basis with all dividends reinvested and is comprised of government bonds from 14 countries; the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index generally representative of intermediate-term government 
bonds, investment grade corporate debt securities and mortgage-backed
securities; the Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index, which includes
approximately 15,000 bonds; the Russell 1000 Growth Index, which is an 
unmanaged index comprised of common stocks of larger U.S. companies with 
greater than average growth orientation and represents the universe of
stocks from which "earnings/growth" money managers typically select; and the
Russell 2000 index, which is an unmanaged capitalization weighted price only 
index which is comprised of 2000 of the smallest stocks in the Russell
3000 index. The performance of funds may also be compared to the combined performance of several indices.
<P>

Returns for Kemper Asian Growth Fund, Kemper Value+Growth Fund, Kemper-Dreman Funds and Kemper Europe Fund include the effect of a temporary waiver of
management fees and/or an absorption of certain operating expenses by Zurich 
Kemper Investments, Inc., as investment advisor, for periods
specified in the prospectus, which improved results. The absorption and
waiver for certain Kemper State Tax-Free Income Funds has been reinstated. Income from
tax-exempt funds may be subject to state and local taxes except as
otherwise provided in the prospectus, and a portion of income may be
subject to the alternative minimum tax for certain investors.

<FONT SIZE=-1># Portfolios are subject to
change. <BR> ## These figures are adjusted for maximum
sales charge (Class A) or the contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC) in
effect at the end of the specified period (Class B). The maximum initial
sales charge (Class A) is 5.75% for Kemper Horizon 10+ Portfolio. The CDSC schedule
for Class B shares for years 1 to 6 is 4%, 3%, 3%, 2%, 2% and 1%.
Adjustment for a full annual period is at CDSC for the next annual level.
Thus, 1-year returns are adjusted for 3% CDSC. For C shares, performance is adjusted for the 1% CDSC for shares redeemed within one year. Sales charges are reduced
or eliminated under certain conditions as described in the funds'
prospectuses.

For more complete information on any Kemper Fund, including management
fees and expenses, please request a free prospectus from your
financial representative, Kemper Shareholder Services (1-800-621-1048),

<P>

Read the prospectus carefully before you invest or send money. Remember
that there is no assurance that the objective of any mutual fund will
be achieved and mutual fund returns and net asset value fluctuate.
Shares are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or
less than their original cost. Money market funds seek to maintain a
net asset value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that
they will. Mutual fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. 
government. 

<P>

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<B>Performance And Yield Notes</B>
<BR>
Returns are historical and do not represent future performance. Returns
and net asset values fluctuate. Shares
are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or less
than the original cost. Kemper Money Funds seek to maintain a net asset
value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that they will.
Fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. government.
<P>

Average annual total return and total return measure net investment
income and capital gain or loss from portfolio investments, assuming reinvestment
of dividends and, for average annual total return only, adjustments for the maximum
sales charge or the contingent deferred sales charge in effect at the end of the periods,
as applicable.  Average annual
total return reflects annualized change while total return reflects
aggregate change. During the periods noted, securities prices
fluctuated. For each money market fund, the current annualized yield is
the seven day annualized net investment income per share as of the
indicated date. Gains or losses are not included. Effective yield
reflects compounding of income.
<P>

<B>Special Risks</B>
<BR>
Investment by certain portfolios in lower rated and non-rated securities
presents a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher
rated securities (principally Kemper Diversified Income Fund and Kemper
High Yield Fund). For portfolios that invest internationally
(principally Kemper International Fund, Kemper Global Income Fund, Kemper
Europe Fund, Kemper Diversified Income Fund, Kemper Asian Growth Fund
and Kemper Worldwide 2004 Fund), there
are special risk considerations, including foreign exchange rates,
foreign government regulations and differing degrees of liquidity that
may adversely affect portfolio securities, all of which are more fully
discussed in the funds' prospectuses. 
Investment in smaller companies (Kemper Small Capitalization Equity Fund
and Kemper-Dreman Small Cap Value Fund) presents greater risk of loss
than investment in large companies. Concentration in certain market
sectors (Kemper-Dreman High Return Fund) presents special risk
considerations.
<P>

Performance of funds may be compared to the performance of various
unmanaged indices including, but not limited to: the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index and the Dow
Jones Industrial Average, which are generally representative of the U.S.
stock market; the Wilshire Large Company Growth Index, which is
generally representative of the market for stocks of larger growth
companies (selected on the basis of sales growth, return on equity and
dividend payout); the Lehman Brothers Government/Corporate Bond index,
which is generally representative of intermediate and long-term
government and investment grade corporate debt securities; the Morgan
Stanley Capital International EAFE, which is generally representative of
international markets; the FT/S&amp;P - Actuaries World Index - Europe, which 
is generally representative of the equity securities of European companies; the Consumer Price Index, generally
representative of the level of inflation; the Salomon Brothers World
Government Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index on a U.S. dollar total return basis with all dividends reinvested and is comprised of government bonds from 14 countries; the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index generally representative of intermediate-term government 
bonds, investment grade corporate debt securities and mortgage-backed
securities; the Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index, which includes
approximately 15,000 bonds; the Russell 1000 Growth Index, which is an 
unmanaged index comprised of common stocks of larger U.S. companies with 
greater than average growth orientation and represents the universe of
stocks from which "earnings/growth" money managers typically select; and the
Russell 2000 index, which is an unmanaged capitalization weighted price only 
index which is comprised of 2000 of the smallest stocks in the Russell
3000 index. The performance of funds may also be compared to the combined performance of several indices.
<P>

Returns for Kemper Asian Growth Fund, Kemper Value+Growth Fund, Kemper-Dreman Funds and Kemper Europe Fund include the effect of a temporary waiver of
management fees and/or an absorption of certain operating expenses by Zurich 
Kemper Investments, Inc., as investment advisor, for periods
specified in the prospectus, which improved results. The absorption and
waiver for certain Kemper State Tax-Free Income Funds has been reinstated. Income from
tax-exempt funds may be subject to state and local taxes except as
otherwise provided in the prospectus, and a portion of income may be
subject to the alternative minimum tax for certain investors.

Returns are historical and do not represent future performance. Returns
and net asset values fluctuate. Shares
are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or less
than the original cost. Kemper Money Funds seek to maintain a net asset
value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that they will.
Fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. government.
<P>

Average annual total return and total return measure net investment
income and capital gain or loss from portfolio investments, assuming reinvestment
of dividends and, for average annual total return only, adjustments for the maximum
sales charge or the contingent deferred sales charge in effect at the end of the periods,
as applicable.  Average annual
total return reflects annualized change while total return reflects
aggregate change. During the periods noted, securities prices
fluctuated. For each money market fund, the current annualized yield is
the seven day annualized net investment income per share as of the
indicated date. Gains or losses are not included. Effective yield
reflects compounding of income.
<P>

<B>Special Risks</B>
<BR>
Investment by certain portfolios in lower rated and non-rated securities
presents a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher
rated securities (principally Kemper Diversified Income Fund and Kemper
High Yield Fund). For portfolios that invest internationally
(principally Kemper International Fund, Kemper Global Income Fund, Kemper
Europe Fund, Kemper Diversified Income Fund, Kemper Asian Growth Fund
and Kemper Worldwide 2004 Fund), there
are special risk considerations, including foreign exchange rates,
foreign government regulations and differing degrees of liquidity that
may adversely affect portfolio securities, all of which are more fully
discussed in the funds' prospectuses. 
Investment in smaller companies (Kemper Small Capitalization Equity Fund
and Kemper-Dreman Small Cap Value Fund) presents greater risk of loss
than investment in large companies. Concentration in certain market
sectors (Kemper-Dreman High Return Fund) presents special risk
considerations.
<P>

Performance of funds may be compared to the performance of various
unmanaged indices including, but not limited to: the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index and the Dow
Jones Industrial Average, which are generally representative of the U.S.
stock market; the Wilshire Large Company Growth Index, which is
generally representative of the market for stocks of larger growth
companies (selected on the basis of sales growth, return on equity and
dividend payout); the Lehman Brothers Government/Corporate Bond index,
which is generally representative of intermediate and long-term
government and investment grade corporate debt securities; the Morgan
Stanley Capital International EAFE, which is generally representative of
international markets; the FT/S&amp;P - Actuaries World Index - Europe, which 
is generally representative of the equity securities of European companies; the Consumer Price Index, generally
representative of the level of inflation; the Salomon Brothers World
Government Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index on a U.S. dollar total return basis with all dividends reinvested and is comprised of government bonds from 14 countries; the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index generally representative of intermediate-term government 
bonds, investment grade corporate debt securities and mortgage-backed
securities; the Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index, which includes
approximately 15,000 bonds; the Russell 1000 Growth Index, which is an 
unmanaged index comprised of common stocks of larger U.S. companies with 
greater than average growth orientation and represents the universe of
stocks from which "earnings/growth" money managers typically select; and the
Russell 2000 index, which is an unmanaged capitalization weighted price only 
index which is comprised of 2000 of the smallest stocks in the Russell
3000 index. The performance of funds may also be compared to the combined performance of several indices.
<P>

Returns for Kemper Asian Growth Fund, Kemper Value+Growth Fund, Kemper-Dreman Funds and Kemper Europe Fund include the effect of a temporary waiver of
management fees and/or an absorption of certain operating expenses by Zurich 
Kemper Investments, Inc., as investment advisor, for periods
specified in the prospectus, which improved results. The absorption and
waiver for certain Kemper State Tax-Free Income Funds has been reinstated. Income from
tax-exempt funds may be subject to state and local taxes except as
otherwise provided in the prospectus, and a portion of income may be
subject to the alternative minimum tax for certain investors.

## These figures are adjusted for maximum sales charge (Class A) or the
contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC) in effect at the end of the
specified period (Class B). The maximum initial sales charge (Class A)
is 4.50% for Kemper Diversified Income Fund. The CDSC schedule for Class B shares for
years 1 to 6 is 4%, 3%, 3%, 2%, 2% and 1%. Adjustment for a full annual
period is at CDSC for the next annual level. Thus, 1-year returns are
adjusted for 3% CDSC. Sales charges are reduced or eliminated under
certain conditions as described in the funds' prospectuses.

<FONT SIZE=-1># Portfolios are subject to
change. <BR> ## These figures are adjusted for maximum
sales charge (Class A) or the contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC) in
effect at the end of the specified period (Class B). The maximum initial
sales charge (Class A) is 5.75% for Kemper Horizon 5 Portfolio. The CDSC schedule
for Class B shares for years 1 to 6 is 4%, 3%, 3%, 2%, 2% and 1%.
Adjustment for a full annual period is at CDSC for the next annual level.
Thus, 1-year returns are adjusted for 3% CDSC. For C shares, performance is adjusted for the 1% CDSC for shares redeemed within one year. Sales charges are reduced
or eliminated under certain conditions as described in the funds'
prospectuses.

<P>

Read the prospectus carefully before you invest or send money. Remember
that there is no assurance that the objective of any mutual fund will
be achieved and mutual fund returns and net asset value fluctuate.
Shares are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or
less than their original cost. Money market funds seek to maintain a
net asset value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that
they will. Mutual fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. 
government.

<B>Performance And Yield Notes</B>
<BR>
Returns are historical and do not represent future performance. Returns
and net asset values fluctuate. Shares
are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or less
than the original cost. Kemper Money Funds seek to maintain a net asset
value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that they will.
Fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. government.
<P>

Average annual total return and total return measure net investment
income and capital gain or loss from portfolio investments, assuming reinvestment
of dividends and, for average annual total return only, adjustments for the maximum
sales charge or the contingent deferred sales charge in effect at the end of the periods,
as applicable.  Average annual
total return reflects annualized change while total return reflects
aggregate change. During the periods noted, securities prices
fluctuated. For each money market fund, the current annualized yield is
the seven day annualized net investment income per share as of the
indicated date. Gains or losses are not included. Effective yield
reflects compounding of income.
<P>

<B>Special Risks</B>
<BR>
Investment by certain portfolios in lower rated and non-rated securities
presents a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher
rated securities (principally Kemper Diversified Income Fund and Kemper
High Yield Fund). For portfolios that invest internationally
(principally Kemper International Fund, Kemper Global Income Fund, Kemper
Europe Fund, Kemper Diversified Income Fund, Kemper Asian Growth Fund
and Kemper Worldwide 2004 Fund), there
are special risk considerations, including foreign exchange rates,
foreign government regulations and differing degrees of liquidity that
may adversely affect portfolio securities, all of which are more fully
discussed in the funds' prospectuses. 
Investment in smaller companies (Kemper Small Capitalization Equity Fund
and Kemper-Dreman Small Cap Value Fund) presents greater risk of loss
than investment in large companies. Concentration in certain market
sectors (Kemper-Dreman High Return Fund) presents special risk
considerations.
<P>

Performance of funds may be compared to the performance of various
unmanaged indices including, but not limited to: the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index and the Dow
Jones Industrial Average, which are generally representative of the U.S.
stock market; the Wilshire Large Company Growth Index, which is
generally representative of the market for stocks of larger growth
companies (selected on the basis of sales growth, return on equity and
dividend payout); the Lehman Brothers Government/Corporate Bond index,
which is generally representative of intermediate and long-term
government and investment grade corporate debt securities; the Morgan
Stanley Capital International EAFE, which is generally representative of
international markets; the FT/S&amp;P - Actuaries World Index - Europe, which 
is generally representative of the equity securities of European companies; the Consumer Price Index, generally
representative of the level of inflation; the Salomon Brothers World
Government Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index on a U.S. dollar total return basis with all dividends reinvested and is comprised of government bonds from 14 countries; the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index generally representative of intermediate-term government 
bonds, investment grade corporate debt securities and mortgage-backed
securities; the Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index, which includes
approximately 15,000 bonds; the Russell 1000 Growth Index, which is an 
unmanaged index comprised of common stocks of larger U.S. companies with 
greater than average growth orientation and represents the universe of
stocks from which "earnings/growth" money managers typically select; and the
Russell 2000 index, which is an unmanaged capitalization weighted price only 
index which is comprised of 2000 of the smallest stocks in the Russell
3000 index. The performance of funds may also be compared to the combined performance of several indices.
<P>

Returns for Kemper Asian Growth Fund, Kemper Value+Growth Fund, Kemper-Dreman Funds and Kemper Europe Fund include the effect of a temporary waiver of
management fees and/or an absorption of certain operating expenses by Zurich 
Kemper Investments, Inc., as investment advisor, for periods
specified in the prospectus, which improved results. The absorption and
waiver for certain Kemper State Tax-Free Income Funds has been reinstated. Income from
tax-exempt funds may be subject to state and local taxes except as
otherwise provided in the prospectus, and a portion of income may be
subject to the alternative minimum tax for certain investors.

## These figures are adjusted for maximum sales charge (Class A) or the
contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC) in effect at the end of the
specified period (Class B). The maximum initial sales charge (Class A)
is 4.50% for Kemper Income and Capital Preservation Fund. The CDSC schedule for Class B shares for
years 1 to 6 is 4%, 3%, 3%, 2%, 2% and 1%. Adjustment for a full annual
period is at CDSC for the next annual level. Thus, 1-year returns are
adjusted for 3% CDSC. Sales charges are reduced or eliminated under
certain conditions as described in the funds' prospectuses.

For more complete information on any Kemper Fund, including management
fees and expenses, please request a free prospectus from your
financial representative, Kemper Shareholder Services (1-800-621-1048),

<P>

Read the prospectus carefully before you invest or send money. Remember
that there is no assurance that the objective of any mutual fund will
be achieved and mutual fund returns and net asset value fluctuate.
Shares are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or
less than their original cost. Money market funds seek to maintain a
net asset value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that
they will. Mutual fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. 
government. 

<P>

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<B>Performance And Yield Notes</B>
<BR>
Returns are historical and do not represent future performance. Returns
and net asset values fluctuate. Shares
are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or less
than the original cost. Kemper Money Funds seek to maintain a net asset
value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that they will.
Fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. government.
<P>

Average annual total return and total return measure net investment
income and capital gain or loss from portfolio investments, assuming reinvestment
of dividends and, for average annual total return only, adjustments for the maximum
sales charge or the contingent deferred sales charge in effect at the end of the periods,
as applicable.  Average annual
total return reflects annualized change while total return reflects
aggregate change. During the periods noted, securities prices
fluctuated. For each money market fund, the current annualized yield is
the seven day annualized net investment income per share as of the
indicated date. Gains or losses are not included. Effective yield
reflects compounding of income.
<P>

<B>Special Risks</B>
<BR>
Investment by certain portfolios in lower rated and non-rated securities
presents a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher
rated securities (principally Kemper Diversified Income Fund and Kemper
High Yield Fund). For portfolios that invest internationally
(principally Kemper International Fund, Kemper Global Income Fund, Kemper
Europe Fund, Kemper Diversified Income Fund, Kemper Asian Growth Fund
and Kemper Worldwide 2004 Fund), there
are special risk considerations, including foreign exchange rates,
foreign government regulations and differing degrees of liquidity that
may adversely affect portfolio securities, all of which are more fully
discussed in the funds' prospectuses. 
Investment in smaller companies (Kemper Small Capitalization Equity Fund
and Kemper-Dreman Small Cap Value Fund) presents greater risk of loss
than investment in large companies. Concentration in certain market
sectors (Kemper-Dreman High Return Fund) presents special risk
considerations.
<P>

Performance of funds may be compared to the performance of various
unmanaged indices including, but not limited to: the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index and the Dow
Jones Industrial Average, which are generally representative of the U.S.
stock market; the Wilshire Large Company Growth Index, which is
generally representative of the market for stocks of larger growth
companies (selected on the basis of sales growth, return on equity and
dividend payout); the Lehman Brothers Government/Corporate Bond index,
which is generally representative of intermediate and long-term
government and investment grade corporate debt securities; the Morgan
Stanley Capital International EAFE, which is generally representative of
international markets; the FT/S&amp;P - Actuaries World Index - Europe, which 
is generally representative of the equity securities of European companies; the Consumer Price Index, generally
representative of the level of inflation; the Salomon Brothers World
Government Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index on a U.S. dollar total return basis with all dividends reinvested and is comprised of government bonds from 14 countries; the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index generally representative of intermediate-term government 
bonds, investment grade corporate debt securities and mortgage-backed
securities; the Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index, which includes
approximately 15,000 bonds; the Russell 1000 Growth Index, which is an 
unmanaged index comprised of common stocks of larger U.S. companies with 
greater than average growth orientation and represents the universe of
stocks from which "earnings/growth" money managers typically select; and the
Russell 2000 index, which is an unmanaged capitalization weighted price only 
index which is comprised of 2000 of the smallest stocks in the Russell
3000 index. The performance of funds may also be compared to the combined performance of several indices.
<P>

Returns for Kemper Asian Growth Fund, Kemper Value+Growth Fund, Kemper-Dreman Funds and Kemper Europe Fund include the effect of a temporary waiver of
management fees and/or an absorption of certain operating expenses by Zurich 
Kemper Investments, Inc., as investment advisor, for periods
specified in the prospectus, which improved results. The absorption and
waiver for certain Kemper State Tax-Free Income Funds has been reinstated. Income from
tax-exempt funds may be subject to state and local taxes except as
otherwise provided in the prospectus, and a portion of income may be
subject to the alternative minimum tax for certain investors.

These figures are adjusted for maximum sales charge (Class A) or the
contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC) in effect at the end of the
specified period (Class B). The maximum initial sales charge (Class A)
is 4.50% for Kemper U.S. Mortgage Fund. The CDSC schedule for Class B shares for
years 1 to 6 is 4%, 3%, 3%, 2%, 2% and 1%. Adjustment for a full annual
period is at CDSC for the next annual level. Thus, 1-year returns are
adjusted for 3% CDSC. Sales charges are reduced or eliminated under
certain conditions as described in the funds' prospectuses.

Read the prospectus carefully before you invest or send money. Remember
that there is no assurance that the objective of any mutual fund will
be achieved and mutual fund returns and net asset value fluctuate.
Shares are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or
less than their original cost. Money market funds seek to maintain a
net asset value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that
they will. Mutual fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. 
government.

<B>Performance And Yield Notes</B>
<BR>
Returns are historical and do not represent future performance. Returns
and net asset values fluctuate. Shares
are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or less
than the original cost. Kemper Money Funds seek to maintain a net asset
value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that they will.
Fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. government.
<P>

Average annual total return and total return measure net investment
income and capital gain or loss from portfolio investments, assuming reinvestment
of dividends and, for average annual total return only, adjustments for the maximum
sales charge or the contingent deferred sales charge in effect at the end of the periods,
as applicable.  Average annual
total return reflects annualized change while total return reflects
aggregate change. During the periods noted, securities prices
fluctuated. For each money market fund, the current annualized yield is
the seven day annualized net investment income per share as of the
indicated date. Gains or losses are not included. Effective yield
reflects compounding of income.
<P>

<B>Special Risks</B>
<BR>
Investment by certain portfolios in lower rated and non-rated securities
presents a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher
rated securities (principally Kemper Diversified Income Fund and Kemper
High Yield Fund). For portfolios that invest internationally
(principally Kemper International Fund, Kemper Global Income Fund, Kemper
Europe Fund, Kemper Diversified Income Fund, Kemper Asian Growth Fund
and Kemper Worldwide 2004 Fund), there
are special risk considerations, including foreign exchange rates,
foreign government regulations and differing degrees of liquidity that
may adversely affect portfolio securities, all of which are more fully
discussed in the funds' prospectuses. 
Investment in smaller companies (Kemper Small Capitalization Equity Fund
and Kemper-Dreman Small Cap Value Fund) presents greater risk of loss
than investment in large companies. Concentration in certain market
sectors (Kemper-Dreman High Return Fund) presents special risk
considerations.
<P>

Performance of funds may be compared to the performance of various
unmanaged indices including, but not limited to: the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index and the Dow
Jones Industrial Average, which are generally representative of the U.S.
stock market; the Wilshire Large Company Growth Index, which is
generally representative of the market for stocks of larger growth
companies (selected on the basis of sales growth, return on equity and
dividend payout); the Lehman Brothers Government/Corporate Bond index,
which is generally representative of intermediate and long-term
government and investment grade corporate debt securities; the Morgan
Stanley Capital International EAFE, which is generally representative of
international markets; the FT/S&amp;P - Actuaries World Index - Europe, which 
is generally representative of the equity securities of European companies; the Consumer Price Index, generally
representative of the level of inflation; the Salomon Brothers World
Government Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index on a U.S. dollar total return basis with all dividends reinvested and is comprised of government bonds from 14 countries; the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index generally representative of intermediate-term government 
bonds, investment grade corporate debt securities and mortgage-backed
securities; the Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index, which includes
approximately 15,000 bonds; the Russell 1000 Growth Index, which is an 
unmanaged index comprised of common stocks of larger U.S. companies with 
greater than average growth orientation and represents the universe of
stocks from which "earnings/growth" money managers typically select; and the
Russell 2000 index, which is an unmanaged capitalization weighted price only 
index which is comprised of 2000 of the smallest stocks in the Russell
3000 index. The performance of funds may also be compared to the combined performance of several indices.
<P>

Returns for Kemper Asian Growth Fund, Kemper Value+Growth Fund, Kemper-Dreman Funds and Kemper Europe Fund include the effect of a temporary waiver of
management fees and/or an absorption of certain operating expenses by Zurich 
Kemper Investments, Inc., as investment advisor, for periods
specified in the prospectus, which improved results. The absorption and
waiver for certain Kemper State Tax-Free Income Funds has been reinstated. Income from
tax-exempt funds may be subject to state and local taxes except as
otherwise provided in the prospectus, and a portion of income may be
subject to the alternative minimum tax for certain investors.

<FONT SIZE=-1>*Based upon the fund's yield and the 37.1% federal income tax rate.
<BR></FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=-1># Portfolios are subject to
change. <BR> ## These figures are adjusted for maximum
sales charge (Class A) or the contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC) in
effect at the end of the specified period (Class B). The maximum initial
sales charge (Class A) is 2.75% for Kemper Intermediate Municipal Bond Fund. The CDSC schedule
for Class B shares for years 1 to 6 is 4%, 3%, 3%, 2%, 2% and 1%.
Adjustment for a full annual period is at CDSC for the next annual level.
Thus, 1-year returns are adjusted for 3% CDSC. Sales charges are reduced
or eliminated under certain conditions as described in the funds'
prospectuses.

For more complete information on any Kemper Fund, including management
fees and expenses, please request a free prospectus from your
financial representative, Kemper Shareholder Services (1-800-621-1048), 
<A HREF="../prospectus_email.html">

<P>

Read the prospectus carefully before you invest or send money. Remember
that there is no assurance that the objective of any mutual fund will
be achieved and mutual fund returns and net asset value fluctuate.
Shares are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or
less than their original cost. Money market funds seek to maintain a
net asset value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that
they will. Mutual fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. 
government.

<B>Performance And Yield Notes</B>
<BR>
Returns are historical and do not represent future performance. Returns
and net asset values fluctuate. Shares
are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or less
than the original cost. Kemper Money Funds seek to maintain a net asset
value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that they will.
Fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. government.
<P>

Average annual total return and total return measure net investment
income and capital gain or loss from portfolio investments, assuming reinvestment
of dividends and, for average annual total return only, adjustments for the maximum
sales charge or the contingent deferred sales charge in effect at the end of the periods,
as applicable.  Average annual
total return reflects annualized change while total return reflects
aggregate change. During the periods noted, securities prices
fluctuated. For each money market fund, the current annualized yield is
the seven day annualized net investment income per share as of the
indicated date. Gains or losses are not included. Effective yield
reflects compounding of income.
<P>

<B>Special Risks</B>
<BR>
Investment by certain portfolios in lower rated and non-rated securities
presents a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher
rated securities (principally Kemper Diversified Income Fund and Kemper
High Yield Fund). For portfolios that invest internationally
(principally Kemper International Fund, Kemper Global Income Fund, Kemper
Europe Fund, Kemper Diversified Income Fund, Kemper Asian Growth Fund
and Kemper Worldwide 2004 Fund), there
are special risk considerations, including foreign exchange rates,
foreign government regulations and differing degrees of liquidity that
may adversely affect portfolio securities, all of which are more fully
discussed in the funds' prospectuses. 
Investment in smaller companies (Kemper Small Capitalization Equity Fund
and Kemper-Dreman Small Cap Value Fund) presents greater risk of loss
than investment in large companies. Concentration in certain market
sectors (Kemper-Dreman High Return Fund) presents special risk
considerations.
<P>

Performance of funds may be compared to the performance of various
unmanaged indices including, but not limited to: the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index and the Dow
Jones Industrial Average, which are generally representative of the U.S.
stock market; the Wilshire Large Company Growth Index, which is
generally representative of the market for stocks of larger growth
companies (selected on the basis of sales growth, return on equity and
dividend payout); the Lehman Brothers Government/Corporate Bond index,
which is generally representative of intermediate and long-term
government and investment grade corporate debt securities; the Morgan
Stanley Capital International EAFE, which is generally representative of
international markets; the FT/S&amp;P - Actuaries World Index - Europe, which 
is generally representative of the equity securities of European companies; the Consumer Price Index, generally
representative of the level of inflation; the Salomon Brothers World
Government Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index on a U.S. dollar total return basis with all dividends reinvested and is comprised of government bonds from 14 countries; the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index generally representative of intermediate-term government 
bonds, investment grade corporate debt securities and mortgage-backed
securities; the Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index, which includes
approximately 15,000 bonds; the Russell 1000 Growth Index, which is an 
unmanaged index comprised of common stocks of larger U.S. companies with 
greater than average growth orientation and represents the universe of
stocks from which "earnings/growth" money managers typically select; and the
Russell 2000 index, which is an unmanaged capitalization weighted price only 
index which is comprised of 2000 of the smallest stocks in the Russell
3000 index. The performance of funds may also be compared to the combined performance of several indices.
<P>

Returns for Kemper Asian Growth Fund, Kemper Value+Growth Fund, Kemper-Dreman Funds and Kemper Europe Fund include the effect of a temporary waiver of
management fees and/or an absorption of certain operating expenses by Zurich 
Kemper Investments, Inc., as investment advisor, for periods
specified in the prospectus, which improved results. The absorption and
waiver for certain Kemper State Tax-Free Income Funds has been reinstated. Income from
tax-exempt funds may be subject to state and local taxes except as
otherwise provided in the prospectus, and a portion of income may be
subject to the alternative minimum tax for certain investors.

period is at CDSC for the next annual level. Thus, 1-year returns are
adjusted for 3% CDSC. Sales charges are reduced or eliminated under
certain conditions as described in the funds' prospectuses.

<P>

Read the prospectus carefully before you invest or send money. Remember
that there is no assurance that the objective of any mutual fund will
be achieved and mutual fund returns and net asset value fluctuate.
Shares are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or
less than their original cost. Money market funds seek to maintain a
net asset value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that
they will. Mutual fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. 
government. 

<P>

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<B>Performance And Yield Notes</B>
<BR>
Returns are historical and do not represent future performance. Returns
and net asset values fluctuate. Shares
are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or less
than the original cost. Kemper Money Funds seek to maintain a net asset
value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that they will.
Fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. government.
<P>

Average annual total return and total return measure net investment
income and capital gain or loss from portfolio investments, assuming reinvestment
of dividends and, for average annual total return only, adjustments for the maximum
sales charge or the contingent deferred sales charge in effect at the end of the periods,
as applicable.  Average annual
total return reflects annualized change while total return reflects
aggregate change. During the periods noted, securities prices
fluctuated. For each money market fund, the current annualized yield is
the seven day annualized net investment income per share as of the
indicated date. Gains or losses are not included. Effective yield
reflects compounding of income.
<P>

<B>Special Risks</B>
<BR>
Investment by certain portfolios in lower rated and non-rated securities
presents a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher
rated securities (principally Kemper Diversified Income Fund and Kemper
High Yield Fund). For portfolios that invest internationally
(principally Kemper International Fund, Kemper Global Income Fund, Kemper
Europe Fund, Kemper Diversified Income Fund, Kemper Asian Growth Fund
and Kemper Worldwide 2004 Fund), there
are special risk considerations, including foreign exchange rates,
foreign government regulations and differing degrees of liquidity that
may adversely affect portfolio securities, all of which are more fully
discussed in the funds' prospectuses. 
Investment in smaller companies (Kemper Small Capitalization Equity Fund
and Kemper-Dreman Small Cap Value Fund) presents greater risk of loss
than investment in large companies. Concentration in certain market
sectors (Kemper-Dreman High Return Fund) presents special risk
considerations.
<P>

Performance of funds may be compared to the performance of various
unmanaged indices including, but not limited to: the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index and the Dow
Jones Industrial Average, which are generally representative of the U.S.
stock market; the Wilshire Large Company Growth Index, which is
generally representative of the market for stocks of larger growth
companies (selected on the basis of sales growth, return on equity and
dividend payout); the Lehman Brothers Government/Corporate Bond index,
which is generally representative of intermediate and long-term
government and investment grade corporate debt securities; the Morgan
Stanley Capital International EAFE, which is generally representative of
international markets; the FT/S&amp;P - Actuaries World Index - Europe, which 
is generally representative of the equity securities of European companies; the Consumer Price Index, generally
representative of the level of inflation; the Salomon Brothers World
Government Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index on a U.S. dollar total return basis with all dividends reinvested and is comprised of government bonds from 14 countries; the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index generally representative of intermediate-term government 
bonds, investment grade corporate debt securities and mortgage-backed
securities; the Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index, which includes
approximately 15,000 bonds; the Russell 1000 Growth Index, which is an 
unmanaged index comprised of common stocks of larger U.S. companies with 
greater than average growth orientation and represents the universe of
stocks from which "earnings/growth" money managers typically select; and the
Russell 2000 index, which is an unmanaged capitalization weighted price only 
index which is comprised of 2000 of the smallest stocks in the Russell
3000 index. The performance of funds may also be compared to the combined performance of several indices.
<P>

Returns for Kemper Asian Growth Fund, Kemper Value+Growth Fund, Kemper-Dreman Funds and Kemper Europe Fund include the effect of a temporary waiver of
management fees and/or an absorption of certain operating expenses by Zurich 
Kemper Investments, Inc., as investment advisor, for periods
specified in the prospectus, which improved results. The absorption and
waiver for certain Kemper State Tax-Free Income Funds has been reinstated. Income from
tax-exempt funds may be subject to state and local taxes except as
otherwise provided in the prospectus, and a portion of income may be
subject to the alternative minimum tax for certain investors.

## These figures are adjusted for maximum sales charge (Class A) or the
contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC) in effect at the end of the
specified period (Class B). The maximum initial sales charge (Class A)
is 3.5% for Kemper Adjustable Rate U.S. Government Fund. The CDSC schedule 
for Class B shares for years 1 to 6 is 4%, 3%, 3%, 2%, 2% and 1%. 
Adjustment for a full annual period is at CDSC for the next annual level. 
Thus, 1-year returns are adjusted for 3% CDSC. Sales charges are 
reduced or eliminated under certain conditions as described in the funds' prospectuses.

Read the prospectus carefully before you invest or send money. Remember
that there is no assurance that the objective of any mutual fund will
be achieved and mutual fund returns and net asset value fluctuate.
Shares are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or
less than their original cost. Money market funds seek to maintain a

they will. Mutual fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S.

<B>Performance And Yield Notes</B>
<BR>
Returns are historical and do not represent future performance. Returns
and net asset values fluctuate. Shares
are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or less
than the original cost. Kemper Money Funds seek to maintain a net asset
value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that they will.
Fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. government.
<P>

Average annual total return and total return measure net investment
income and capital gain or loss from portfolio investments, assuming reinvestment
of dividends and, for average annual total return only, adjustments for the maximum
sales charge or the contingent deferred sales charge in effect at the end of the periods,
as applicable.  Average annual
total return reflects annualized change while total return reflects
aggregate change. During the periods noted, securities prices
fluctuated. For each money market fund, the current annualized yield is
the seven day annualized net investment income per share as of the
indicated date. Gains or losses are not included. Effective yield
reflects compounding of income.
<P>

<B>Special Risks</B>
<BR>
Investment by certain portfolios in lower rated and non-rated securities
presents a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher
rated securities (principally Kemper Diversified Income Fund and Kemper
High Yield Fund). For portfolios that invest internationally
(principally Kemper International Fund, Kemper Global Income Fund, Kemper
Europe Fund, Kemper Diversified Income Fund, Kemper Asian Growth Fund
and Kemper Worldwide 2004 Fund), there
are special risk considerations, including foreign exchange rates,
foreign government regulations and differing degrees of liquidity that
may adversely affect portfolio securities, all of which are more fully
discussed in the funds' prospectuses. 
Investment in smaller companies (Kemper Small Capitalization Equity Fund
and Kemper-Dreman Small Cap Value Fund) presents greater risk of loss
than investment in large companies. Concentration in certain market
sectors (Kemper-Dreman High Return Fund) presents special risk
considerations.
<P>

Performance of funds may be compared to the performance of various
unmanaged indices including, but not limited to: the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index and the Dow
Jones Industrial Average, which are generally representative of the U.S.
stock market; the Wilshire Large Company Growth Index, which is
generally representative of the market for stocks of larger growth
companies (selected on the basis of sales growth, return on equity and
dividend payout); the Lehman Brothers Government/Corporate Bond index,
which is generally representative of intermediate and long-term
government and investment grade corporate debt securities; the Morgan
Stanley Capital International EAFE, which is generally representative of
international markets; the FT/S&amp;P - Actuaries World Index - Europe, which 
is generally representative of the equity securities of European companies; the Consumer Price Index, generally
representative of the level of inflation; the Salomon Brothers World
Government Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index on a U.S. dollar total return basis with all dividends reinvested and is comprised of government bonds from 14 countries; the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index generally representative of intermediate-term government 
bonds, investment grade corporate debt securities and mortgage-backed
securities; the Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index, which includes
approximately 15,000 bonds; the Russell 1000 Growth Index, which is an 
unmanaged index comprised of common stocks of larger U.S. companies with 
greater than average growth orientation and represents the universe of
stocks from which "earnings/growth" money managers typically select; and the
Russell 2000 index, which is an unmanaged capitalization weighted price only 
index which is comprised of 2000 of the smallest stocks in the Russell
3000 index. The performance of funds may also be compared to the combined performance of several indices.
<P>

Returns for Kemper Asian Growth Fund, Kemper Value+Growth Fund, Kemper-Dreman Funds and Kemper Europe Fund include the effect of a temporary waiver of
management fees and/or an absorption of certain operating expenses by Zurich 
Kemper Investments, Inc., as investment advisor, for periods
specified in the prospectus, which improved results. The absorption and
waiver for certain Kemper State Tax-Free Income Funds has been reinstated. Income from
tax-exempt funds may be subject to state and local taxes except as
otherwise provided in the prospectus, and a portion of income may be
subject to the alternative minimum tax for certain investors.

* A series of Kemper Money Funds.<BR>
# Portfolios are subject to change.<BR>
## Based upon the fund's yield and the 37.1% federal income tax</FONT>

<P>

For more complete information on any Kemper Fund, including management
fees and expenses, please request a free prospectus from your
financial representative, Kemper Shareholder Services (1-800-621-1048), 
<A HREF="../prospectus_email.html">
e-mail us your request</A> for a prospectus through the mail or 
<A HREF="../prospectus_download.html"> download a prospectus.</A>

<P>

Read the prospectus carefully before you invest or send money. Remember
that there is no assurance that the objective of any mutual fund will
be achieved and mutual fund returns and net asset value fluctuate.
Shares are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or
less than their original cost. Money market funds seek to maintain a
net asset value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that
they will. Mutual fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. 
government. 

<P>

<FONT SIZE=-1>



<B>Performance And Yield Notes</B>
<BR>
Returns are historical and do not represent future performance. Returns
and net asset values fluctuate. Shares
are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or less
than the original cost. Kemper Money Funds seek to maintain a net asset
value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that they will.
Fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. government.
<P>

Average annual total return and total return measure net investment
income and capital gain or loss from portfolio investments, assuming reinvestment
of dividends and, for average annual total return only, adjustments for the maximum
sales charge or the contingent deferred sales charge in effect at the end of the periods,
as applicable.  Average annual
total return reflects annualized change while total return reflects
aggregate change. During the periods noted, securities prices
fluctuated. For each money market fund, the current annualized yield is
the seven day annualized net investment income per share as of the
indicated date. Gains or losses are not included. Effective yield
reflects compounding of income.
<P>

<B>Special Risks</B>
<BR>
Investment by certain portfolios in lower rated and non-rated securities
presents a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher
rated securities (principally Kemper Diversified Income Fund and Kemper
High Yield Fund). For portfolios that invest internationally
(principally Kemper International Fund, Kemper Global Income Fund, Kemper
Europe Fund, Kemper Diversified Income Fund, Kemper Asian Growth Fund
and Kemper Worldwide 2004 Fund), there
are special risk considerations, including foreign exchange rates,
foreign government regulations and differing degrees of liquidity that
may adversely affect portfolio securities, all of which are more fully
discussed in the funds' prospectuses. 
Investment in smaller companies (Kemper Small Capitalization Equity Fund
and Kemper-Dreman Small Cap Value Fund) presents greater risk of loss
than investment in large companies. Concentration in certain market
sectors (Kemper-Dreman High Return Fund) presents special risk
considerations.
<P>

Performance of funds may be compared to the performance of various
unmanaged indices including, but not limited to: the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index and the Dow
Jones Industrial Average, which are generally representative of the U.S.
stock market; the Wilshire Large Company Growth Index, which is
generally representative of the market for stocks of larger growth
companies (selected on the basis of sales growth, return on equity and
dividend payout); the Lehman Brothers Government/Corporate Bond index,
which is generally representative of intermediate and long-term
government and investment grade corporate debt securities; the Morgan
Stanley Capital International EAFE, which is generally representative of
international markets; the FT/S&amp;P - Actuaries World Index - Europe, which 
is generally representative of the equity securities of European companies; the Consumer Price Index, generally
representative of the level of inflation; the Salomon Brothers World
Government Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index on a U.S. dollar total return basis with all dividends reinvested and is comprised of government bonds from 14 countries; the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index generally representative of intermediate-term government 
bonds, investment grade corporate debt securities and mortgage-backed
securities; the Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index, which includes
approximately 15,000 bonds; the Russell 1000 Growth Index, which is an 
unmanaged index comprised of common stocks of larger U.S. companies with 
greater than average growth orientation and represents the universe of
stocks from which "earnings/growth" money managers typically select; and the
Russell 2000 index, which is an unmanaged capitalization weighted price only 
index which is comprised of 2000 of the smallest stocks in the Russell
3000 index. The performance of funds may also be compared to the combined performance of several indices.
<P>

Returns for Kemper Asian Growth Fund, Kemper Value+Growth Fund, Kemper-Dreman Funds and Kemper Europe Fund include the effect of a temporary waiver of
management fees and/or an absorption of certain operating expenses by Zurich 
Kemper Investments, Inc., as investment advisor, for periods
specified in the prospectus, which improved results. The absorption and
waiver for certain Kemper State Tax-Free Income Funds has been reinstated. Income from
tax-exempt funds may be subject to state and local taxes except as
otherwise provided in the prospectus, and a portion of income may be
subject to the alternative minimum tax for certain investors.

<BR>

As you know, Kemper Funds believes that working with a financial representative is the best way to evaluate todays investment alternatives.

<BR><BR>

"Financial representative" is a catch-all term for the licensed professionals who represent others' financial interests. Investors today have their choice of where they meet their representative (at a brokerage office, at a financial institution or in their home, for example), the level of service (from full to limited) they want to receive, and how services will be compensated for. And, as markets become increasingly complex and global, an increasing number of financial representatives have continued with their education. 

<BR><BR>

Do you need help in deciphering your financial representative's business card? Despite the many possible affiliations and designations, almost every financial representative comes from one of four basic disciplines. Here's a quick portrait of each "type."

<BR><BR>

<B>The accountant</B><BR>
You expect a certified public accountant (CPA) to be able to advise you on audit, accounting and tax issues. To offer more encompassing help, including personal income tax planning, investment planning and estate planning, many CPAs also have sought accreditation from the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, as a Personal Financial Specialist (PFS). A PFS must have several hours of planning experience over a three-year period, pass a comprehensive exam and submit references. Reaccreditation is required every three years.

<BR><BR>

<B>The insurance agent</B><BR>
To be serving as a financial representative, an insurance agent can be expected to have a license to sell securities as well as insurance. Insurance agents' interest in the spectrum of personal financial management has led to the creation of a Chartered Financial Consultant (ChFC) designation. Accreditation requires coursework (in investments, income taxation and estate and financial planning), a minimum of three years of experience and adherence to a code of ethics. Chartered life underwriters (CLUs) qualify for a fast track to the ChFC, but the designation is not 
exclusive to the insurance industry. The American College, Bryn Mawr, Pa., awards the ChFC.  

<BR><BR>

<B>The financial planner</B><BR>
Financial planners represent a broad view, offering advice in investment planning (including mutual funds and individual securities), insurance, taxes, retirement, estate and investment planning. A certified financial planner (CFP) has completed extensive education, examination, experience and ethics requirements set by the Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards, Denver.  While almost half of all CFPs work for financial planning firms, they're also employed at securities, accounting and insurance firms and banks.

<BR><BR>

<B>The broker</B><BR>
Brokers are sales representatives who work for a brokerage firm, also known as a broker/dealer. They are registered with the National Association of Securities Dealers and have passed a qualifying examination. Because theyre trained in securities laws, their expertise is in the selection and monitoring of stocks, bonds, mutual funds and other financial products. But while the generic "broker" gives you an idea of the representative's training, it does not satisfactorily describe the scope of his or her service. That's why many of those with a foundation in brokerage prefer 
to call themselves financial consultants or advisors. Many brokers also have 
additional designations, such as the CFP.

A financial representative can become your trusted partner for the
long-run. He or she will get to know you and work with you, to help you
reach a lifetime of financial goals.
<BR><BR>

<STRONG>Here's what you should expect from the start...</STRONG>
<BR><BR>

<STRONG>A detailed analysis of your financial situation.</STRONG> Your representative can
examine your current investments, income and tax situation, to analyze
your current level of "fiscal fitness."
<BR><BR>

<STRONG>A clear definition of your goals.</STRONG> Together, you and your financial
representative can formalize your goals - for the near-term (buy a new
house in a few years?), and for the long-run (college for children?
retirement?).
<BR><BR>

<STRONG>An individualized strategy to help reach your goals.</STRONG> Most likely, your
investment plan will include a combination of investments that address
your time and safety requirements. Your portfolio will be uniquely yours
- geared toward helping to meet your financial needs now, and later. 
<BR><BR>

<STRONG>Regular portfolio reviews.</STRONG>
You and your financial representative should periodically review your
investments to be sure you're on track to reaching your goals.
Similarly, you should talk with your representative throughout various
life stages. Marriage, new babies, retirement, aging parents, new jobs -
all of these might warrant a change in your investment strategy.
<BR><BR>

<STRONG><FONT SIZE=+1>Do you really need a professional financial representative? </FONT SIZE=+1></STRONG>

Your financial representative is a licensed professional, trained to
have an in-depth understanding of the financial markets. What's more, he
or she is expected to maintain the highest level of integrity and
respect in dealing with clients.
<BR><BR>

Entrusting your investments to an investment professional can actually
lift a weight off your shoulders. 
<BR><BR>

<STRONG>Why? Because your financial representative can...</STRONG>
<BR><BR>

<STRONG>Evaluate and help choose the best investments alternatives for you.</STRONG> Your
representative can pre-screen investment choices, and present you with
the ones that make the most sense for your situation. 
<BR><BR>

<STRONG>Help you manage risk.</STRONG> Investing to build capital always involves some degree of risk. A
financial representative can help you find the most comfortable
combination of risk and reward for you, based on your goals and
time-frame. Likewise, he or she can help you employ a variety of
risk-reduction strategies to help protect your investments.
<BR><BR>

<STRONG>Monitor the markets - and everything that impacts them.</STRONG> You won't have
to worry and watch the markets, because that's your representative's
full-time job. He or she will help keep your focus on long-term results
- and put short-term ups and downs in perspective. This can help reduce
losses due to "panic selling" - losses that result from selling
investments at the wrong time, for the wrong reasons. 
<BR><BR>

<STRONG>Relieve you of administrative details.</STRONG> Your investment transactions can
go much more smoothly when handled by a professional financial
representative. In fact, he or she can take most of the time-consuming,
but necessary, paperwork off your hands. And, if you make all of your
investments through one representative, matters like address, telephone
number, and name changes can be handled with one phone call.
Furthermore, your representative can even help you organize and report
your investments' performance at tax-time.

Mutual fund investors who worked with a professional financial
representative have reaped greater rewards!
<BR><BR>

A well-chosen group of mutual funds can make an excellent cornerstone
for a results-oriented investment portfolio. And, studies have shown
that investors who use professional financial representatives - taking
advantage of their experience and guidance - have achieved better
results than investors who chose to go it alone.
<BR><BR>

<STRONG>See for yourself...</STRONG>
<BR><BR>

A study of 1,000 equity and fixed income mutual funds showed that
investors who bought funds through a professional financial
representative had better investment results than those who purchased
funds themselves - 15% better in equity funds and 9% better in fixed
income funds.* 
<BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE=-1> *Source: Dalbar, Inc. study "Quantitative Analysis of Investor Behavior"
(6/30/94). This information is historical and does not represent future
results. Also, there can be no guarantee that a particular investor's
results will be improved through professional advice. The study compared
cumulative investment returns over the period 12/31/92 to 12/30/94 for a
wide variety of equity and fixed income funds sold directly to investors
and sold through financial representatives. Performance information does
not consider the effect of sales charges paid by investors who worked
with financial representatives. Source of investment information was the
Investment Company Institute.</FONT SIZE=-1>
<BR><BR>

<STRONG>
Here's how your financial representative's experience and guidance can
help provide this exceptional benefit...</STRONG>
<BR><BR>

<STRONG>Encouragement to stay the course.</STRONG> A long-term perspective is one of the
best predictors of financial success. And, because studies have shown
that investors who worked with a professional financial representative
held their mutual fund investments longer than those who did not (3.2
vs. 2 years respectively for equity funds, and 2.9 vs. 1.7 years for
fixed income funds)** - they may have greater potential for success in
the long-run. 
<BR><BR>

<STRONG>Information about emerging opportunities.</STRONG> As an investment professional,
it's your financial representative's job to stay abreast of (and let you
know about) new investment opportunities. On the other hand, an investor
working alone would have to do lots of homework, including reading a
variety of financial publications and investment newsletters, to gain
timely awareness of such opportunities.
<BR><BR>

<STRONG>Advice when it's time to move.</STRONG> Should you move quickly to take advantage
of a new opportunity? Or should you stick with your current investments?
With a professional financial representative at your side, you can be
confident that you're making educated choices based on time-tested
experience. And that's the best feeling of all.

<B>Why Kemper Asian Growth Fund makes sense</B>
<UL TYPE=CIRCLE>
<LI>Ability to invest in developing or emerging countries
<LI>Experienced management
<LI>Potential to increase returns
</UL>

<P>

Fund Objective: Long-term capital growth, by investing in a diversified portfolio consisting primarily of equity securities of Asian companies.

<P>

<B>Ability to invest in developing or emerging countries</B><BR>
The fund invests primarily in Asian equity securities believed to have potential for capital growth. The fund invests primarily in developing or "emerging" economies.

<P>

For example:
<UL TYPE=CIRCLE>
<LI>China
<LI>Indonesia
<LI>Korea
<LI>Malaysia
<LI>Philippines
<LI>Thailand
<LI>Taiwan
</UL>

As a policy, the fund will invest in Japan only when economic conditions warrant and then only on a limited basis. However, the fund may invest without limit in developed countries such as Hong Kong and Singapore.

<P>

Portfolio Manager: Andrew Mason, director of Asian Equities. Prior to joining Zurich Kemper Investments, Mr. Mason was portfolio manager of the Asian and Japanese portfolios for a United Kingdom pension fund and has 14 years of international investment experience..

Kemper has been managing international equities since 1981 -- longer than 94% of the companies managing international equities.*<BR>

<IMG SRC="gifs/nl_confirm_head.gif" ALT="News About Your Transaction Confirmation Statements">

<BR>
<BODY>
If you've recently made an account transaction or changed any
of the services or features on your account, you probably noticed
a few changes in your confirmation statement.  In late August,
we introduced the second phase of our project to consolidate your
transaction confirmation statements.  Now, when several changes
or transactions occur on your Kemper Funds accounts during the
same day, you'll receive one consolidated statement, instead of
separate statements for each individual transaction. 
<P>
For example, an exchange of shares from one fund to another would
previously prompt two statements:  one confirming a redemption
and one confirming a purchase.  Now, one statement confirms both
transactions.  
<P>
Another difference you'll notice is that your transaction confirmation
statement no longer shows any prior account transactions.  Previously,
your statement included your transactions year-to-date or the
last 18 transactions on your account, whichever was the smallest
number of transactions.  Now, you'll see only the transaction
that prompted the statement.  This change should help to eliminate
confusion by differentiating transaction confirmation statements
from quarterly account statements.    
<P>
&quot;We're very pleased to introduce this new phase in our consolidated
statement project,&quot;  says Ann Laughlin, first vice president
of Kemper Shareholder Marketing and Broker Communications.  &quot;By
simplifying the way in which we report transactions and consolidating
daily account activity onto one statement, we hope to eliminate
confusion<I> and</I> help to reduce fund expenses.&quot; 
<P>
Transaction confirmation statements now have the same look and
format as your quarterly statement.  No matter what type of statement
you receive from us, information such as the date of your statement,
your fund and account numbers and the tax identification number
on your account can always be found in the same place.  Transaction
confirmation statements will be consolidated in the same manner
as your quarterly statements:  All accounts with the same registration,
address and tax identification number will appear on one statement,
unless you have requested otherwise.

<BR>
Kemper Funds has reduced the 15 calendar day &quot;hold&quot;
policy on purchases made by check or ACH transfer.  The primary
purpose of such a hold period - a common restriction among mutual
funds and banks - is to protect you and the fund from fraud and
theft.  However, we found that the waiting period could be reduced
to 10 calendar days without compromising security.  Of course,
for most Kemper Funds, which are generally used as long-term investments,
a hold period is seldom a problem.  But short-term investors,
particularly those in Kemper Money Funds, may appreciate the
greater flexibility and liquidity of a shorter hold period.

across at least 15 industries.
<P>
Earlier this year, the fund gained a new portfolio manager.  Steven
Stokes, a chartered financial analyst, joined Dreman Value Advisors,
Inc. as managing director.  In addition to his work on the Small
Cap Value Fund, he is portfolio manager for approximately $200
million in institutional assets.  Stokes stresses that Kemper-Dreman
Small Cap Value Fund's investment strategy and style remain unchanged.
 &quot;The philosophy takes precedence over personality,&quot;
he says.  &quot;We'll continue to pursue attractively priced stocks
with strong fundamentals - the strategy that has contributed to
the fund's strong performance since its inception in 1992.&quot;
<P>
<I>Returns are historical and do not reflect future performance.
 Returns and net asset values fluctuate.  Shares are redeemable
at net asset value, which may be more or less than original cost.</I>
<P>
<I>* Morningstar ratings range from five stars (highest) to
one star (lowest) and represent its assessment of the historical
risk level and total return of a fund relative to its class as
a weighted average for the three-, five- and 10-year periods.
 Ratings are not absolute or predictive of future performance.</I>
<P>
<I>Average annual total return measures net investment income
and capital gain or loss from portfolio investments, assuming
reinvestment of dividends and adjustment for the maximum applicable
sales charge of 5.75%.  Average annual total return reflects annualized
change.  Returns and rankings are historical and do not reflect
future performance.  Performance shown is for Class A shares.
 Sales charges are reduced or eliminated under certain conditions
as described in the fund's prospectus.  Performance of other classes
will vary from that shown because of differences in sales charges
and fees paid by shareholders investing in different classes.</I>
<P>
<I>Lipper Analytical Services, Inc. rankings are based upon
changes in net asset value with dividends reinvested and do not
include the effect of sales charges.  If they did, results may
have been less favorable.  Investment in small companies presents
greater risk than investment in larger, more established companies.</I>
 <P>
<I>To obtain a Kemper Funds prospectus in addition to those
you already have, please contact your financial representative,
call Kemper Shareholder Services at 1-800-621-1048, or <A HREF="../prospectus_download.html">download

fees and expenses.  Please read it carefully before you invest
or send money.</I>

<BR>
<BODY>
We're planning a number of enhancements for your 1996 year-end
account statement to provide a more comprehensive overview of
the performance of your Kemper Funds investments.
<P>
<UL TYPE=CIRCLE>
<LI>If you have multiple accounts, the first part of your statement,
the portfolio summary, reports on your entire Kemper Funds portfolio.
 The summary will now include your initial investment amount*,
any subsequent purchases you've made, any amounts withdrawn and
the change in your account value as of December 31.  We'll also
include your investments' market value as of the beginning of
the statement period, allowing you to compare it to the current
market value.
<P>
<LI>Similar to the portfolio summary, for each of your accounts,
we will show your initial investment amount*, subsequent purchases
you've made, any amounts withdrawn and the change in your account
value as of December 31.
<P>
<LI>If you've held your account for two years or more, you'll
also receive a &quot;Personal Performance&quot; summary showing
the one-year total return on each of your accounts, as well as
their average annual total return since inception* and a graphic
illustration for each of your Kemper fund accounts.
<P>
<LI>The taxable income portion of your dividend summary will be
expanded to show ordinary income (which includes both your income
dividends and short-term capital gains) and long-term capital
gains.  
</UL>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=1>* For accounts established prior to December 31, 1989, the market value as of December 31, 1989, will be used in place of your initial investment amount and as a starting point for calculating your average annual total return.
<P>
For Kemper-Dreman accounts established after September 11, 1995, the market value as of September 11, 1995, will be used in place of your initial investment amount and as a starting point for calculating your average annual total return.
</FONT SIZE=1><P>
A detailed explanation of the enhanced year-end statement will
be in the next issue of <I>Kemper Fundamentals</I>.  You'll receive
it, along with your statement, in early January, 1997.

<BR>
<B>Patrick S. Adams</B>, 35, in June was named portfolio manager of the $2.6 billion <A  HREF="../funds/growth.html">Kemper Growth Fund</A>, our flagship growth equity
mutual fund. Adams, who brings an impressive record as a growth
investment style manager, is the latest in a series of enhancements
to Kemper's equity investment team in the last year.
<P>
As part of an August 1995 acquisition, Kemper through its new
wholly owned subsidiary Dreman Value Advisors, Inc. (DVA) assumed
management responsibility for <A  HREF="../funds/high_return.html">Kemper-Dreman High Return Fund</A>,
<A  HREF="../funds/contrarian.html">Kemper-Dreman Contrarian Fund</A> and <A  HREF="../funds/smallcap.html">Kemper-Dreman Small Cap Value
Fund</A>.
<P>
With the acquisition of DVA came the value investing style of
David Dreman, who is generally considered the pioneer of a contrarian
investment strategy. Dreman is the chairman of DVA and manages
Kemper-Dreman High Return Fund.  Christian Bertelsen in March joined DVA as chief
investment officer and portfolio manager of Kemper-Dreman Contrarian
Fund. Bertelsen has an outstanding track record as an investment
manager and practitioner of the contrarian investment strategy.
<P>
Shortly after the DVA acquisition, Kemper hired veteran portfolio
manager Steven Reynolds to oversee and direct the company's equity
investment department. Reynolds served as interim manager for
Kemper Growth Fund until Adams joined Kemper in June.
<P>
In addition to assuming responsibility for the Kemper-Dreman Funds,
the company in the last year introduced four new equity funds:
<A  HREF="../funds/europe.html">Kemper Europe Fund</A>, <A  HREF="../funds/assetallocation.html">Kemper Horizon Fund</A>, <A  HREF="../funds/valuegrowth.html">Kemper Value+Growth

<IMG SRC = "gifs/new_name_head.gif" ALT = "A New Name: Zurich Kemper Investments, Inc.">
<BR>
In January, Kemper Financial Services, Inc. became an indirect subsidiary of Zurich Insurance Group. "The name is different," says Stephen B. Timbers, president, chief executive and chief investment officer, "but our fundamental mission is the same: To manufacture and distribute high quality investment management products and services to individuals and institutions and to help them achieve their long-term financial goals. Our goal is to fulfill this mission better than anyone else in the investment management business."
<P>


<IMG SRC="gifs/new_name1_subhead.gif" ALT="About the Parent Company">
<BR>
With nearly $70 billion in total assets at year-end 1994, the Zurich Insurance Group ranks among the largest international insurance organizations in the world. Zurich is a company with four core businesses, three of them insurance-related: property-casualty, life and reinsurance. The purchase of Kemper reflects its commitment to the fourth business - asset management - and to its goal to become a world leader in the global financial services market.<P>

Zurich is a public company, traded under the symbols ZURN (Telekurs) and ZURZn (Reuters) on the Swiss Stock Exchange. <P>

<BODY>

Why leave the delivery of your government check to chance?  By

filling out a single form, you can avoid those time-consuming

trips to the bank and rest assured that your check won't be stolen,

lost or delayed in the mail. If you receive a Social Security

check or other government payments on a regular basis, you've

probably been contacted in recent months about having your checks

deposited directly into your bank account

<P>

<B>A trend of the future</B>  

<P>

The U.S. Treasury Department this summer announced that

all Social Security recipients who apply for benefits after August

1, 1996, will have their checks automatically deposited into their

bank accounts whenever possible.  In addition, by 1999 all federal

payments, including salaries and other benefits such as those

paid to veterans, will be issued electronically.  Jim Hagedorn,

the Treasury Department's director of public affairs for the financial

management service, reports that converting to electronic payments

could save the government as much as $500 million over the next

five years and eliminate about 100,000 check thefts and forgeries

a year.

<P>

<B>Kemper Funds can help</B>

<P>

As an alternative to your bank account, consider having your government

checks deposited directly into your Kemper Money Funds account.

 Kemper Money Funds offer the opportunity to earn higher yields

<I>and</I> easy access to your money - as of September 5, 1996,

Kemper Money Market Fund's current 7-day yield was 5.04% while

the average bank money fund yield was 2.65%* - and many checking

accounts don't pay interest.  Of

course, unlike bank products, no money fund is insured or guaranteed

by the U.S. government and there is no assurance that any fund

can maintain a $1.00 share value. Bank products offer fixed or variable 
rates and principal is fixed and may be insured.  

<P>

Once your government check is deposited into your Kemper Money

Fund, you can write an unlimited amount of checks (for $500 or

more) each month free, or use our EXPRESS-Transfer service to

transfer as little as $100 into your bank savings or checking

account.  You can also exchange a portion of the deposit to another

Kemper fund for long-term income or growth opportunities.  Plus,

you can make and verify account transactions 24-hours a day via

our automated phone service, KemperACCESS.  

<P>

Kemper's three money funds offer you these services and attractive

yields while maintaining a conservative investment philosophy

that emphasizes quality and consistency, not risk-taking.  

<P>

To receive a Government Direct Deposit form, contact the government

agency that issues your checks.  Or, call Kemper Shareholder Services

at 1-800-621-1048.  Our representatives can provide the necessary

form (ask for Form 93) and answer your questions about Kemper

Money Funds' performance and services. 

<P>

* Yield shown is the average annualized net investment income

per share.  Past performance is historical and is no guarantee

of future results.  Yields will fluctuate.  Bank interest rate

shown is for the 100 leading banks and thrifts as of 9/5/96 according

to <I>Bank Rate Monitor</I>.
